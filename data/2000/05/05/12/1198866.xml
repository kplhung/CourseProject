        <p>Over sandwiches and keyboards yesterday, at soda machines and bus stops, it seemed as if New Yorkers were hardly surprised by the news: the marital problems of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and his wife, Donna Hanover.</p>
        <p>''Come on, we knew a long time ago this wasn't much of a marriage,'' said Sidney Levitan, 89, a retired high school administrator.</p>
        <p>There was even little interest in assigning blame to one party or the other. ''With the kinds of lives they lead, always busy, barely seeing each other, I mean, how can you really hold a marriage together?'' asked Scott Howell, 24, who works in marketing for an office equipment company.</p>
        <p>Instead -- in a world where divorce is common, where a presidential scandal has inured people to accounts of infidelity, where talk shows obliterate lines between public and private dozens of times every morning -- the questions yesterday seemed to revolve less around the dissolution of a marriage and more around the way the husband and wife were conducting themselves as they did the dissolving in full public view.</p>
        <p>Did Mr. Giuliani violate what seemed to be a longstanding agreement with his wife that they would not discuss their marriage in front of television cameras? Did he force Ms. Hanover into the obviously uncomfortable position of revealing their personal problems herself? Was it unfair of Ms. Hanover, or beneath her, to publicly accuse the mayor of having had a relationship with a member of his staff?</p>
        <p>Or are either of them to blame for how the revelations unfolded? Instead, were they both backed into a corner by the media coverage of their marital problems?</p>
        <p>In many cases yesterday, the refrain on street corners and in Internet chat rooms contained more than hint of hypocrisy. In one breath, people said that the drama of a political-marriage soap opera was riveting, and they had, of course, been fixated on every twist. In the next breath, they said they were ashamed that their mayor and first lady seemed to have taken the news media's bait, lowering themselves to participate in a slightly more decorous version of ''The Jerry Springer Show.''</p>
        <p>But one thing is clear. When it came to assigning blame for how that all got started, Mr. Giuliani took the brunt of the criticism.</p>
        <p>''For him to go on TV and say he was getting a separation, without talking to his wife. . . .'' said John Peterson, 44, scowling as he finished his fries at the Roosevelt Field Mall in Garden City, N.Y. ''If he does this to his family, what will he do to the people?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Peterson added: ''You don't do it this way. If you have a problem, you discuss it with your wife, you discuss it with a priest or somebody, you come to a civil agreement. You don't just put it out in the media and crush your wife.''</p>
        <p>In dozens of interviews yesterday from Albany to downtown Brooklyn, the sentiment about Mr. Giuliani's marital problems seemed to follow a familiar script that played out among voters during the impeachment battle over President Clinton's relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky.</p>
        <p>Those interviewed said that Mr. Giuliani's actions within his marriage should have no political consequences, because his conduct as a husband had little bearing on his ability to be a mayor or even a senator.</p>
        <p>But for many, his handling of the announcement on Wednesday that he was seeking a separation, one that took Ms. Hanover by surprise, did have troubling political implications. It reminded them of the aggressive -- some called it reckless -- way that Mr. Giuliani had handled many other public disclosures, like the release of the arrest record of Patrick M. Dorismond, the unarmed black man who was shot to death by the police in March.</p>
        <p>''I thought that his comments when Dorismond was killed indicated a lack of control, a lashing out,'' said Nancy Dubler, the director of the bio-ethics division at Montefiore Medical Center. ''That was the analogy that I thought of when he made this announcement yesterday, an announcement that both his staff and his wife were unprepared for. I find that disturbing in someone who's in a position of power.''</p>
        <p>Her remarks illustrated a theme that played out in many interviews yesterday: criticism of Mr. Giuliani -- and to a lesser extent of Ms. Hanover -- kept returning more to considerations of decorum, fairness and grace under pressure than to morality or marital infidelity.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dubler said she thought that the mayor's surprise announcement ''showed disregard for his wife's feelings, yes, but that seems to miss the fact that he lost it, and their presumably carefully negotiated positions of privacy. He blew it. Why, we don't know. It indicates a lack of control over what you say in challenging situations, where someone in the mayor's position needs more discipline.''</p>
        <p>Leslie Carrington, an administrative secretary who works with Ms. Dubler, echoed that view. ''Somebody's going to get hurt anyway,'' Mr. Carrington said, ''but you can do it in a way to lessen the pain as much as possible. You can be more responsible in how you approach it. I'm trying to be objective and not be judgmental, but she seemed to be very hurt by it.''</p>
        <p>Tim Wheelock, 38, who lives in Troy and works in a car dealership, did not worry so much about being judgmental. ''I think the way he handled it hurt him more than the fact that he was having an affair,'' Mr. Wheelock said. ''Why air it in public like that? Now he looks like a piece of garbage. He sure didn't help himself with women. He just shot himself in the foot.''</p>
        <p>By comparison, judgments about  Mr. Giuliani's conduct within his marriage tended to pop up only in passing. In a few conversations upstate, where there has been little media attention given to the upheaval, questions of morality seemed more prominent. ''Anyone who's married, you should be committed to your wife or husband,'' said Edwin Newton, 41, a Republican of Rochester. ''It's typical of what's going on in society today, but it's not right.''</p>
        <p>But around the city, those sentiments were muted either by a feeling of ''It's none of our business,'' or of ''That kind of thing doesn't matter as much as it used to.''</p>
        <p>''The behavior itself?'' asked Catharine R. Stimpson, a feminist theorist and dean of the Graduate School of Arts and Science at New York University. ''Well, you know you can read about the Romans and the Europeans. You can read about many civilizations. Men behaving badly. Women behaving tearfully. This is the stuff of literature. Remember, my friend, this is the week that NBC was doing Jason and the Argonauts, and Jason was not nice to Medea.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Levitan, the retired school administrator, who was soaking up sun in Bryant Park, not far from where Mr. Giuliani made his announcement Wednesday, added: ''Now it's right out in the open. Senior citizens, even, living in sin. Unmarried. Fooling around.''</p>
        <p>In fact, the view that Mr. Giuliani was the villain in breaking up the marriage seemed to matter to many people yesterday only because it made his abrupt announcement of his marital problems seem even more unfair to Ms. Hanover. In essence, people appeared to be asking, if Ms. Hanover was the spurned partner in the marriage, why did she not get to decide how to handle any announcement? Isn't it only fair that she get to call the shots?</p>
        <p>Others added, perhaps more damningly, that they thought the mayor's culpability for the way the news broke went much further back than Wednesday's announcement. By making frequent appearances in public with Judith Nathan, the woman whom Mr. Giuliani called a ''very good friend,'' he was deliberately forcing the issue of his troubled marriage to become public, tempting the media to cover it, many people said.</p>
        <p>For some, the actions recalled those of Gary Hart, who dared reporters in 1988 to document rumors of his marital infidelity. But in Mr. Giuliani's case, they said, the dare was less foolhardy, and could even be seen as strategic.</p>
        <p>''The mayor is a very smart man, and he does nothing casually,'' said Dr. Paul N. Orloff, an ophthalmologist who practices in Manhattan. ''When he took Judith Nathan out so publicly, it made a statement. He wanted this to come out. It is his exit strategy.''</p>
        <p>THE MAYOR'S SEPARATION: THE REACTION  Correction:  May 13, 2000, Saturday  A front-page article yesterday about reaction to Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's marital separation misstated the year that Gary Hart encouraged reporters to follow him around during his presidential campaign. It was 1987, not 1988.</p>
