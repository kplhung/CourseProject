        <p>The End of the Affair</p>
        <p>''Were you two lovers?'' Henry (Stephen Rea) asks Maurice (Ralph Fiennes). In fact, Maurice and Henry's wife, Sarah (Julianne Moore, left), had a wartime affair, but now Maurice is about to join Henry in an investigation of Sarah's latest affair. In his adaptation of Graham Greene's 1951 novel, the director Neil Jordan brilliantly turns to the real concern: an agonizing struggle between religious faith and carnal love. Taking artful liberties, ''he creates a seamlessly engrossing film that does full justice to its depth of thought and feeling,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times.</p>
        <p>1999. Columbia Tri-Star. $107.37; DVD, $27.95. 105 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: May 16.</p>

        <p>The End of the Affair</p>
        <p>''Were you two lovers?'' Henry (Stephen Rea) asks Maurice (Ralph Fiennes). In fact, Maurice and Henry's wife, Sarah (Julianne Moore, left), had a wartime affair, but now Maurice is about to join Henry in an investigation of Sarah's latest affair.

Taking artful liberties, ''he creates a seamlessly engrossing film that does full justice to its depth of thought and feeling,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times.</p>
        <p>1999. Columbia Tri-Star. $107.37; DVD, $27.95. 105 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: May 16.</p>
        <p>Cradle Will Rock</p>
        <p>Like a crowded Diego Rivera sociopolitical lobby mural, Tim Robbins's sprawling cinematic pastiche tries to crystallize Depression art, government and economics into a single and grand theatrical gesture: ''The Cradle Will Rock,'' as staged by Orson Welles and John Houseman. A W.P.A. Federal Theater Project, ''Cradle'' is a Brechtian agitprop work by Marc Blitzstein (Hank Azaria), who dreams up a musical under the auspices of an imaginary Brecht. Mr. Robbins mounts a parallel ''Ragtime''-like tableau in a ''big, brave, sometimes maddeningly reductive film that rises through sheer talent and enthusiasm over its own limitations'' (Maslin).</p>
        <p>1999. Touchstone. $104.16; DVD, $29.99. 132 minutes. Closed captioned. Release date: May 16.</p>
        <p>Felicia's Journey</p>
        <p>Searching the bleak English industrial landscape for the man who impregnated her, young Felicia (Elaine Cassidy) encounters Hilditch, a stout, beady-eyed chef who goes home to cook elaborate meals under the videotaped supervision of his dead mother and baste thoughts of dark deeds revealed only gradually in flashbacks of his encounters with women in his little green car. But don't expect a predictable cat-and-mouse game from the director Atom Egoyan, who ''brilliantly bends this Gothic-flavored fable to express his own tricky cinematic vision'' (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>1999. Artisan. $112.18; DVD, $24.98. 116 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13. Release date: May 16.</p>
        <p>Galaxy Quest</p>
        <p>As the stars of ''Galaxy Quest,'' an old television series along the lines of ''Star Trek,'' tour the fan club circuit, they are approached by real aliens, called Thermians, who mistake them for bona fide space heroes and ask their help against enemies chasing them around the universe. That appeals to the ''Galaxy Quest'' captain (Tim Allen), who galvanizes his crew and blasts off with the visitors on a mission that ''offers a few genuine laughs, moves swiftly, if not at warp speed, and is led by a talented cast'' (Lawrence Van Gelder).</p>
        <p>1999. Dreamworks. $22.99; DVD, $26.99. 102 minutes. Closed captioned. PG.</p>
        <p>Straight to Video</p>
        <p>Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a theater release, appeared on television or been on videocassette in earlier editions.</p>
        <p>POSSESSION. In Andrzej Zulawski's striking but perplexing horror film, a tormented woman (Isabelle Adjani) has been cheating on her husband (Sam Neill) with a human lover and another partner who starts out with a set of tentacles. ''It's a movie that contains a certain amount of unseemly gore and makes no sense whatsoever,'' Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times. That may have been because he was watching a theatrical version stripped down to around 80 minutes. Here, 45 minutes have been restored, making matters complete, if not that much clearer. 1981. Anchor Bay. $14.98; DVD, $29.98. 123 minutes.</p>
        <p>WALKING WITH DINOSAURS. The BBC's six-part series, shown on the Discovery Channel, takes the big creatures from the late Jurassic period, 220 million years ago, to the late Cretaceous, 65 million years ago, when a giant meteor or other causes spelled the end. 1999. BBC Video. $24.98, two cassettes; DVD, $34.98. Episodes run 30 minutes each.</p>
        <p>ANNE FRANK: THE MISSING CHAPTER. Based on Melissa Muller's biography, which reveals that several pages were removed from the original diary, Bernard Hammelburg's documentary stirs some new ingredients into the famous story: Anne's reflections on her parents' unhappy marriage, descriptions of how the family lived in Germany before the war, and the identity of the person who betrayed them. 1998. Home Vision. $29.95. 43 minutes.</p>
