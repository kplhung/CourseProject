        <p>THE saying that necessity is the mother of invention was not, as far as can be determined, coined on Madison Avenue. But the trade organization representing the nation's advertising agencies is taking that adage to heart in planning its annual management conference.</p>
        <p>The organization, the American Association of Advertising Agencies, typically schedules the conference to begin on a Wednesday and end on a Saturday. This year, though, the hotel in Southampton, Bermuda, that will serve as the site for the conference was available only from Thursday through Saturday.</p>
        <p>So the conference agenda is being trimmed; events started yesterday and will end tomorrow. Conference planners took the opportunity to reassess the agenda, deciding to narrow the focus to concentrate on a few topics rather than a wide variety -- the better to increase the appeal of the event to busy senior managers.</p>
        <p>''It's a good time to experiment with the format,'' said O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive at the association, known as the Four A's, reshaping it to ''make it more like the format of our media conference.'' That meeting, held in February, lasts two and a half days and usually draws about 1,000 attendees.</p>
        <p>''Our next two management conferences, for 2001 and 2002, are now scheduled to run three and a half days each because the hotels were booked that way,'' Mr. Drake said. ''But if we think the new format is a better way to go, that can be reconsidered.''</p>
        <p>The agenda of this meeting -- formally known as the 2000 Four A's Management Conference -- is being devoted to two primary subjects: creativity, to be discussed today, and the impact of the Internet, to be discussed tomorrow.</p>
        <p>''With those changes, and the prospects of a good program, we're expecting our highest attendance since 1990,'' Mr. Drake said, estimating that about 475 people would come to the meeting compared with a recent average of around 400.</p>
        <p>Of course, the record growth that Madison Avenue is enjoying is also encouraging executives to travel for a couple days of speeches, sun and the libations that characters in the film ''Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead'' celebrate as ''boat drinks.'' The conference schedule includes a cocktail cruise, a beach barbecue and a chance to take part in what is described as a ''catamaran snorkeling sail.''</p>
        <p>''Business has never been better,'' Mr. Drake said. ''It's as good a year as I can remember.''</p>
        <p>''There may be some storm clouds on the horizon,'' he added, particularly if dot-coms significantly cut back on ad spending in the traditional media. ''But the first quarter was very good and the second is, too.''</p>
        <p>''The single biggest issue'' facing the agency industry, Mr. Drake said, is one related to the rapid expansion of the Internet economy: talent.</p>
        <p>''Attracting the very best to our industry'' to help fill jobs created by the additional work generated by new-economy advertisers is a challenge, he added, as is ''retaining talented people'' who are being wooed away by ''Wall Street, the dot-coms and Hollywood.''</p>
        <p>''At the conference, we'll be talking about some initiatives to help our agencies'' in recruiting employees, Mr. Drake said, which will include efforts with the American Advertising Federation, which has a large student membership, and the Advertising Educational Foundation. He will also discuss a project centered on a videotape produced by DDB Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, ''that talks about how exciting it is to work at an advertising agency.''</p>
        <p>The implications of Internet marketing will also be on the agenda of a conference that the Four A's plans in cooperation with its counterpart trade organization for clients, the Association of National Advertisers.</p>
        <p>That conference, likely to be held for one or two days in January in New York, would be the first to be jointly sponsored by the agency and advertiser associations. ''We hope it will be an annual conference,'' Mr. Drake said, ''and we may do others.''</p>
        <p>Last month, the operations committee of the Four A's and the board of the advertiser association met together for the first time, Mr. Drake said. The two trade organizations have had spats in recent years, particularly over an effort by the advertiser association, later abandoned, to invite agencies to become members.</p>
        <p>Despite their differences, ''there are clearly areas where we can cooperate,'' Mr. Drake said.</p>
        <p>At a business session that opened the management conference yesterday afternoon, the board of the Four A's elected officers for 2000-01.</p>
        <p>Philip B. Dusenberry, chairman at BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide unit of Omnicom, became the 2000-2001 chairman. He had been the 1999-2000 vice chairman. Shelly Lazarus, chairwoman and chief executive at Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide in New York, part of the WPP Group, served as the chairwoman for 1999-2000; she becomes chairwoman emeritus. John J. Dooner Jr., president and chief operating officer at the Interpublic Group of Companies in New York, was elected the 2000-2001 vice chairman. He had been a director at large on the association's board since 1995.</p>
        <p>And J. Melvin Muse, chairman at Muse Cordero Chen &amp; Partners in Los Angeles, part of Muse Creative Holdings, became the 2000-2001 secretary-treasurer. He had been a regional director at large on the association's board. John Emmerling, chairman and chief creative officer at Emmerling Post in New York, served as the secretary-treasurer for 1999-2000.</p>
        <p>As hard as the Four A's staff members are working to increase attendance at the conference, members are working to reduce the potential attendance at future conferences through mergers and acquisitions like the pending takeover by WPP of Young &amp; Rubicam Inc.</p>
        <p>''Ten years from now,'' Mr. Drake said, laughing, ''the Four A's annual conference will be a dinner for six or seven.''</p>
