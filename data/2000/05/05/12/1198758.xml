        <p>WHEN safety ideas come along, the government is usually the first to embrace them. Automakers are dragged along later, sometimes kicking and screaming. But with daytime running lamps, the pattern is reversed.</p>
        <p>General Motors equips all of its vehicles with the lamps and hopes its competitors will do the same. Greg Martin, a spokesman, said the daytime lamps were good for the public and not a competitive technology. ''We have a whole history of adopting certain safety technologies,'' he said, including crash dummies and breakaway light poles. ''We simply open up the toy chest and let others beg, borrow or steal.''</p>
        <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has allowed the lamps since 1993, but with no great enthusiasm. In fact, the brightness of those lights is now set at 10 percent of the maximum of a high-beam headlamp, but the Transportation Department announced a proposal in 1998 to reduce their maximum because of what Transportation Secretary Rodney E. Slater called ''annoying and unnecessary glare.'' The proposal has not become a rule, and G.M. disputes the idea that the lamps cause glare.</p>
        <p>The department, which could conceivably require the lamps on all new cars and trucks, is undecided on their usefulness. ''We don't have data that shows a positive crash-avoidance result,'' said Stephen R. Kratzke, the highway traffic agency's associate administrator for safety standards. It has a study under way and expects the results this summer, he said.</p>
        <p>Others are divided. The National Transportation Safety Board, an independent government agency better known for investigating plane crashes and train wrecks, called for daytime lights in 1985. The board even recommended that the National Safety Council, a private group, organize a campaign to persuade drivers to turn on low-beam headlamps in the daytime. But the safety council found its own members split over the idea, and dropped it.</p>
        <p>G.M., though, has no doubts. Last month, the company said that an independent study it commissioned had found that the lamps had cut ''multivehicle, non-rear-end collisions'' by more than 5 percent since it began equipping cars that way in 1995.</p>
        <p>The report, by Exponent Failure Analysis Associates of San Francisco, looked at the collision rates of various cars in the last model year that they were produced without the running lamps, compared with the first year that they had them. The idea was to eliminate other variables, by comparing Luminas to Luminas and Camaros to Camaros. In addition to G.M. models, the study looked at Volvos, Saabs and Volkswagens, which also use running lamps. So do some 2000-model Toyotas.</p>
        <p>The study looked at data from 12 states, including Pennsylvania and Maryland but no other states in the Northeast, from 1994-97. (Most models with the lamps first got them in the '96 model year.)</p>
        <p>According to the study, reductions were biggest in daytime multivehicle side collisions (in which, for example, a car proceeds past a stop sign because it does not see a vehicle coming from the side), daytime head-on collisions and daytime multivehicle collisions during turns.</p>
        <p>The cars with daytime running lamps also had fewer crashes in the early evening, according to the study, which said the reason might be that some people forget to turn on their lights at dusk, but still get some light and ''conspicuity,'' as the engineers call it, with the running lights. (But Transportation Department literature cautions car shoppers that if they buy a car with the lamps, it is important to put on regular lights at dusk, since the running lamps are only dim headlamps, not taillights.)</p>
        <p>G.M. is confident that regulators will eventually reach the same conclusion. ''It's just intuitive,'' said C. Thomas Terry, director of safety affairs and regulation at G.M.</p>
        <p>If the government did require daytime lamps, the change would be the biggest in lighting rules since 1985, when it ordered a third, high-mounted brake light, an addition that the Transportation Department says has cut rear-end crashes by 2 percent. In addition to Canada, which has required daytime lamps since December 1989, Iceland, Norway and Sweden have made the lights mandatory. But engineers point out that daytime lights may make more sense in those Northern countries -- where for much of the year the sun does not get high in the sky -- than here. The lights are particularly effective at dusk, proponents say.</p>
        <p>But they are not popular here. American drivers are fussy and conservative about headlights, experts say. The highway traffic administration has had 400 comments on its plan to dim running lights, most of them unfavorable to the lights in general. In comparison, its proposal on advanced air bags drew only 140 public comments, Mr. Kratzke said.</p>
        <p>Some letters said that before cars had daytime lights, only motorcycles had them, and thus they stood out from regular traffic. Others had less well-formed objections.</p>
        <p>Lighting is an emerging problem for his agency. Another big source of complaints is high-intensity-discharge headlamps -- the brighter lights, which sometimes appear blue to other drivers, on new luxury models.</p>
        <p>''There is a really hard balance to strike here,'' Mr. Kratzke said. ''We know from basic demographics that the United States is getting older, and older drivers need more light from their vehicle to perform the driving task, and less light from everyone else's vehicle.'' Another change, Mr. Kratzke said, is that with more sport utilities, pickups and large vans on the road, headlamps are often mounted higher than they were on cars, making running lamps or high-intensity lights more of a problem than when lights were generally lower.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Terry of G.M. said scientific tests showed that the glare from daytime lamps was never disabling, and seldom approached the point of being uncomfortable. ''When Canada introduced daytime running lamps, they also had complaints,'' he said, adding that criticism faded as the lights became less of a novelty.</p>
        <p>Not that the lights became popular. The feature does not sell vehicles for G.M., said Mr. Martin, the company spokesman. ''We don't market them,'' he said. ''People are annoyed with them. They say, 'How do I turn off the damned lights?' '' The company hopes that its study will convince G.M. vehicle owners, and others, of the lights' utility.</p>
