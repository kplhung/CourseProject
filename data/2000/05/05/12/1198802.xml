        <p>When leasing begins tomorrow for the 921 rental apartments at the 40-story brick-and-glass tower at 42nd Street and the Hudson River, it will be a milestone in the 16-year journey Larry Silverstein has been on since he first envisioned the project in 1984.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silverstein, president of Silverstein Properties of Manhattan, is developing the $225 million building -- the first of two towers planned for his River Place development on the full block between 11th and 12th Avenues -- in anticipation of the renewal that he expects to wash over the stretch of 42nd Street west of Eighth Avenue. Mr. Silverstein always anticipated that the redevelopment of Times Square, now awash with millions of square feet of new and proposed office space, would ignite the need for housing nearby.</p>

        <p>When leasing begins tomorrow for the 921 rental apartments at the 40-story brick-and-glass tower at 42nd Street and the Hudson River, it will be a milestone in the 16-year journey Larry Silverstein has been on since he first envisioned the project in 1984.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silverstein, president of Silverstein Properties of Manhattan, is developing the $225 million building -- the first of two towers planned for his River Place development on the full block between 11th and 12th Avenues -- in anticipation of the renewal that he expects to wash over the stretch of 42nd Street west of Eighth Avenue. Mr. Silverstein always anticipated that the redevelopment of Times Square, now awash with millions of square feet of new and proposed office space, would ignite the need for housing nearby.</p>
        <p>''The site's proximity to the river and to the planned office space three blocks east propelled this development,'' Mr. Silverstein said. ''Little did I know it would take until 1999 to get started.'' In the intervening years, the developer waited out a rezoning of the site from industrial use, an unsuccessful lawsuit concerning the change, the recession and the political debate over proposals to use the site for expansion of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center.</p>
        <p>The waiting ended last July when the developer, using financing from a consortium of lenders led by the Bank of New York as well as his own equity, started building the first tower, 1 River Place. Because the developer is receiving a 20-year tax abatement from the city under its 421a tax abatement program, 20 percent of the units will be for tenants with maximum annual incomes of $25,545 to $47,770, depending on family size.</p>
        <p>The building, where occupancy will start in July, is the first rental project for Mr. Silverstein. Though his company is best known as a commercial developer, it has also either built or converted at least 3,000 co-op or condominium units. The company's office buildings include 7 World Trade Center, with two million square feet of space, and 140 Broadway, with 1.2 million square feet</p>
        <p>Mr. Silverstein is stocking 1 River Place with smaller apartments: studio, one-  and two-bedroom units with 360 to 1,202 square feet. Because Costas Kondylis, the Manhattan architect, designed the building with multiple angles and ribbon windows, the units have unusual layouts and clear city and river views.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silverstein said he also stressed amenities, including valet parking for 200 cars, 40,000 square feet of retail space, a cafe and high-tech wiring. There will also be a 34,000-square-foot fitness center, including a gym, an Olympic-size pool, two outdoor tennis courts, a slightly-smaller-than-regulation indoor basketball court, a 2,500-square-foot special events room and three sun decks.</p>
        <p>Monthly rents for the market-rate units will start at $1,650 for studios, $2,100 for one-bedroom units and $3,300 for two bedrooms, said Nancy Packes, president of Feathered Nest, a rental brokerage firm in Manhattan and the project's leasing agent. Monthly rents for the moderate-income units will be $639 to $822.</p>
        <p>While 1 River Place is the largest residential project in the four-block West 42nd Street area -- now a hodgepodge of buildings, including warehouses and parking lots -- it will not be the last. At least four more apartment towers are planned, helping to restart the area's revival.</p>
        <p>The proposed projects include a 40-story apartment building with 260 rentals over six theaters at 42nd Street and Dyer Avenue, between Ninth and 10th Avenues, that the Brodsky Organization in partnership with Quinlan &amp; Field Inc., both of Manhattan, expects to start next month. Twenty percent of the units will be for tenants with limited incomes. The project also calls for the development of a new 499-seat Shubert theater and five new or rebuilt smaller theaters.</p>
        <p>In 10 months to a year, the Durst Organization together with the Brodsky Organization also plans to build a rental tower, with 200 to 250 mixed-income units, at the northeast corner of Ninth Avenue and 42nd Street. And the second tower at River Place ''will probably be residential,'' Mr. Silverstein, said, adding that construction could start as soon as 2001.</p>
        <p>The new buildings will join the New Gotham, a 374-unit mixed-income rental that led the way for the current residential surge when it opened two years ago between 10th and 11th Avenues and 42nd and 43rd Streets. The building was fully leased in seven months, according to the  Gotham Organization of Manhattan, the developer.</p>
        <p>The far west 40's is still on the edge as a residential area, said Cathe LeBlanc, managing director of the rental division at the Corcoran Group, a Manhattan brokerage firm. ''And beyond 10th Avenue, which is farther away from the necessary residential services tenants require, such as food stores and restaurants,'' she added, ''new construction must offer units that are priced to draw people there and have amenities within to service them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Silverstein is upbeat about the project's prospects. ''There is more than enough demand given the influx of professionals to take all the planned apartments,'' he said, ''and we will get our share.''</p>
