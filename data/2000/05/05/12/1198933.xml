        <p>The British artist Oladele Bamgboye, born in Nigeria in 1963, comes with impressive credentials. He has appeared in international exhibitions like Documenta X and the last Johannesburg Biennial and was included in the memorable exhibition of African photography at the Guggenheim in New York in 1996.</p>
        <p>For his first New York solo he has brought both early photographs and a new digital-based multi-piece. The latter, created during a residency at ArtPace in San Antonio, is in part an electronic update on ethnology and its obsession with authenticity. It is also a cyberspace take on the ever present question of the status of the original in the age of mechanical reproduction.</p>

        <p>Thomas Erben Gallery</p>
        <p>516 West 20th Street, Chelsea</p>
        <p>Through June 10</p>
        <p>The British artist Oladele Bamgboye, born in Nigeria in 1963, comes with impressive credentials. He has appeared in international exhibitions like Documenta X and the last Johannesburg Biennial and was included in the memorable exhibition of African photography at the Guggenheim in New York in 1996.</p>
        <p>For his first New York solo he has brought both early photographs and a new digital-based multi-piece. The latter, created during a residency at ArtPace in San Antonio, is in part an electronic update on ethnology and its obsession with authenticity. It is also a cyberspace take on the ever present question of the status of the original in the age of mechanical reproduction.</p>
        <p>He has scanned a handful of ancient Egyptian artifacts into one computer, then digitally manipulated the images to create new candy-colored shapes. Clones of these customized, presumably unique forms appear on a second computer. This exercise in archiving as reinvention is accompanied by digital films, one of a laborious reinstallation of Egyptian art at the British Museum, the other of Mr. Bamgboye sitting at a terminal making his scans.</p>
        <p>Viewers of the Erben show are invited to have small items of their own scanned for inclusion in a boundless online museum where display is dust-free and all things are of equal value.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bamgboye presents these somewhat abstract ideas with wit and style, and with the glitches inevitable in a technology that has only recently been taken seriously as an art medium.</p>
        <p>The show's main visual interest comes from large-print 1980's photographs in which the artist's nude figure seems to be half-submerged in backgrounds of patterned fabric or wallpaper. The pictures may look computer-assisted but were produced from studio setups, giving the question of ''the real'' yet another workout.</p>
