        <p>Correction of May 11 front-page article about settlement of antitrust case involving pricing of compact discs, which omitted a passage at the continuation in some copies because of production error</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Because of a production error, a front-page article yesterday about the settlement of an antitrust case involving the pricing of compact discs omitted a passage at the continuation in some copies. The affected paragraphs should have read:</p>
        <p>The marketing agreements, which the F.T.C. said violated federal antitrust law, were between many large and small retailers and the five music companies, which control 85 percent of the $15 billion CD market.</p>
        <p>The companies that settled the case were Time Warner, which announced earlier this year that it had reached a deal with the F.T.C.; the Sony Corporation of America; the Bertelsmann Music Group; EMI Music Distribution; and Universal Music and Video Distribution. All the companies have denied that the marketing agreements violated the law, and many of them declined today to discuss the settlement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pitofsky said the agreements, known as ''minimum advertised price'' programs, or MAP, were carried out in an effort by the manufacturers to end a price war earlier in the 1990's by such discounters as Circuit City, Wal-Mart, Best Buy and Target.</p>
