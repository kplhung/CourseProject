        <p>Clad in a long purple robe, Christopher James was trying to find a classmate among the 5,000 New York University students clad in identical purple robes who were filing into Washington Square Park for their graduation yesterday morning.</p>
        <p>Ordinarily, the hunt might have been hopeless. But he succeeded, because like hundreds of other students, Mr. James, who completed his undergraduate degree in sociology, carried a cell phone -- the latest accessory in graduation wear.</p>
        <p>In most other respects, however, the ceremony at N.Y.U. -- one of the largest among the nation's private universities -- was a traditional one. Bagpipers from N.Y.U.'s pipes and drums corps heralded the graduates' arrival. The students vied for attention by vigorously chanting the names of their undergraduate and graduate divisions. Speakers urged them to improve the world. And scores of graduates jumped into the Washington Square fountain when the ceremony was over.</p>
        <p>''It was a wonderful ceremony,'' said Barbara Golda, the beaming mother of a new graduate, who marked the occasion by wearing the university's school color -- violet -- in her hat, her nail polish (fingers and toes), her shawl and the flowers on her dress. ''I liked the enthusiasm and I liked the speeches,'' she added. ''They were meaningful but not long.''</p>
        <p>N.Y.U. bestowed five honorary degrees, on Frank McCourt, author of ''Angela's Ashes''; Alan Menken, an Oscar-winning composer whose credits include scores for ''The Little Mermaid,'' ''Aladdin'' and ''Beauty and the Beast''; Robert M. Solow, a Nobel Prize-winning economics professor from M.I.T.; Lyudmila A. Verbitskaya, the first woman to lead St. Petersburg State University in Russia; and William J. McDonough, president of the New York Federal Reserve Bank. Mr. McDonough, the ceremony's featured speaker, told the graduates that he and the others honored were there not just because they worked hard but also because they were lucky.</p>
        <p>The students earning regular degrees were similarly diverse, as reflected in the names of the 13 students who carried the banners of their schools up to the stage: Rafiq, Padmini, Yoshio, Kuei-chiu, Marie-Michele, Shachar, Irfan and Maxim as well as Ethan, Albert, Nicole, Kelsey and Eve.</p>
        <p>For the first time, N.Y.U. graduated two separate sets of medical students, those from the N.Y.U. School of Medicine and those from the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, which recently affiliated with N.Y.U.</p>
        <p>Midway through the morning ceremony, as N.Y.U.'s president, L. Jay Oliva, was addressing the graduates, one impatient student jumped into the fountain and peeled off his graduation robe. Some students wear blue jeans or bathing suits under their robes.  This graduate -- a young man -- wore nothing. To the stunned amazement of onlookers, he pranced around the fountain for what seemed like several minutes before security guards moved in, helping him back into his robe and escorting him away.</p>
        <p>President Oliva, who had just finished commenting on the ''extraordinary'' nature of N.Y.U. students, stopped momentarily, then asked, ''Wasn't there someone who guaranteed each of us 10 seconds of glory?'' before returning smoothly to his prepared text.</p>
        <p>Others who frolicked in the fountain later called the dipping tradition irresistible, as they splashed in the grimy water and took each other's pictures.</p>
        <p>Joshua Hess, a 22-year-old graduate from New Orleans wearing sleek orange sunglasses and heavy tan-and-white shoes, said he jumped in (totally clothed) though his classmates declined to join him. ''I'm an extrovert,'' he said, pronouncing the water ''absolutely excellent.''</p>
