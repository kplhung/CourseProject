        <p>NETHERLANDS: BID TO SPEED LOCKERBIE TRIAL -- The trial of two Libyans in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, adjourned until May 23 so the two sides could discuss speeding up proceedings. The trial, expected to last a year or more, might be shorter if both could agree on items of evidence found in the tons of debris. Days have been spent on bits of a suitcase, charred clothes and the cassette recorder believed to have had the bomb inside.</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: DEPUTY TO LONDON'S MAYOR -- Nicky Gavron, a Labor Party councilor and a supporter of Prime Minister Tony Blair, will become the deputy to Ken Livingstone, the new mayor of London who was opposed by Mr. Blair. Ms. Gavron said she accepted the post only after Mr. Livingstone dropped plans to bring a court challenge against Mr. Blair's plan for partial privatization of the city's subway system.</p>

        <p>ZIMBABWE: TALKS TO STEM VIOLENCE -- White farmers and black veterans of the country's independence war in the 1970's held further talks aimed at ending the crisis over veterans' invasions of white-owned land.

Meanwhile, five more farm invasions were reported overnight.</p>

        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>CANADA: TALK SHOW HOST FACES CENSORSHIP -- Canadian radio stations will have to censor anti-gay remarks by Laura Schlessinger, a conservative American talk show host, under a ruling by the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council, a self-regulatory group. It said Dr. Schlessinger, the target of a boycott campaign by American gay groups, broke Canada's broadcasting code by being abusively biased against homosexuals. Canadian stations that broadcast taped versions of the call-in show are expected to excise anti-gay commentary beforehand.</p>

        <p>CANADA: CHINESE DEPORTED -- In one of Canada's largest mass deportations, 90 illegal migrants returned to China in a charter jet from British Columbia. The deportees were among nearly 600 Chinese who were detained after arriving illegally in ships on Canada's Pacific Coast last summer.</p>

        <p>COLOMBIA: AMERICAN DELEGATION -- In what he called a sign of ''concern about the situation'' in Colombia, the State Department's senior political official arrived for his third visit in nine months. The delegation led by Under Secretary Thomas Pickering is to hold two days of meetings with President Andres Pastrana and other top officials in a bid to coordinate an anti-narcotics strategy they say is being hampered by the United States Congress's delays in approving a $1.7 billion emergency aid package.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: CHALLENGER GAINS -- Vicente Fox, the main opposition candidate in the July 2 presidential election, has pulled slightly ahead of the governing party's nominee, Francisco Labastida, according to a nationwide opinion poll. The survey, commissioned by Reuters and carried out by Zogby International, a New York research firm, said Mr. Fox was supported by 46.3 percent of voters and Mr. Labastida by 41.6 percent. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.2 percent.</p>

        <p>VENEZUELA: CORRUPTION ACCUSATIONS -- With a general election less than three weeks away, prosecutors recommended that the chief political aide to President Hugo Chavez be charged with corruption. The aide, Luis Miquilena, denied he mismanaged official accounts and used his position to obtain government contracts. Two aides to Mr. Chavez's main rival in the election were also accused of enriching themselves illegally.</p>

        <p>CHINA: FALUN GONG DETENTIONS -- Police arrested dozens of members of the banned Falun Gong mystical movement as they attempted to mark the birthday of the movement's founder in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. The day is traditionally regarded in China as the birthday of Buddhism's founder, and Falun Gong followers believe that their exiled master, Li Hongzhi, left, was born on that day as well.</p>
        <p>(AP)</p>
        <p>SRI LANKA: WAR TAX -- As fighting between government troops and separatist Tamil rebels continued to rage in the northern Jaffna peninsula, the government moved to raise an additional $161 million for its war against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam by raising taxes, issuing treasury bills and increasing excise duties on cigarettes and liquor.</p>

        <p>SINGAPORE: HAZE RETURNS -- Once again, the annual smog from fires in Indonesia set mostly by illegal loggers and planters drifted over Singapore, smudging the skies and tinging the air with the scent of woodsmoke. So far, the smog does not approach the choking levels reached throughout the region in 1997.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: WITHDRAWAL PROTESTED -- The northern border town of Metulla shut down in protest at Israel's coming withdrawal of troops from Lebanon. Residents burned tires and marched down their main street to the Lebanese border, chanting, ''Security, security,'' to voice their concern that their homes will become the front line in the battle between Hezbollah, or Party of God, guerrillas and Israel.</p>
