        <p>Jets receiver Wayne Chrebet and Keith Elias, a running back formerly with the Giants and the Indianapolis Colts, were each fined $230 yesterday after pleading guilty to a nuisance violation stemming from a disturbance outside a Seaside Heights, N.J., bar on Feb. 6.</p>
        <p>Chrebet had been arrested and charged with disorderly conduct outside the Bamboo Bar, and Elias, who is now a free agent, had been arrested and charged with disorderly conduct and resisting arrest. Two of Elias's brothers were also arrested.</p>
        <p>In court yesterday, Chrebet, Elias and his brothers pleaded guilty to a lesser offense of violating the town's public-nuisance ordinance, a routine procedure, according to the deputy court administrator, Mary Jo Pisciotta.</p>
        <p>Chrebet did not appear in court, but was represented by his lawyer, Arthur B. Weiss.</p>
        <p>''It was so insignificant that he didn't even have to appear in court,'' Weiss told The Associated Press, adding that Chrebet opted to plead guilty to avoid the publicity of a trial.</p>
        <p>The three Elias brothers did appear in court. Brian and Gregory Elias were also fined $230 for violating the same local ordinance.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the National Football League said the league had been monitoring the case since the arrests and that yesterday's pleas would be reviewed under the league's personal-conduct policy.</p>
        <p>Kim Pascarella, the municipal prosecutor, said the incident began with a disagreement inside the bar that did not involve the four, but it spilled outside onto a sidewalk, where the four were arrested.</p>
        <p>Detective Sgt. David Szalkowski of Seaside Heights said the incident was a misunderstanding.</p>
        <p>''I think it got blown out of proportion,'' Szalkowski told The Associated Press.</p>
        <p>''If they were going around shoving people, especially with their celebrity status, the victims would have come forward, if any existed.''</p>
