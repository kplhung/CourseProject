        <p>The appointment of Edward M. Egan as the ninth Roman Catholic archbishop of New York represents more than just the filling of an ecclesiastical position; for the future of the city, it could be the political event of the year. Over the past century and a half, Archbishop Egan's predecessors have wielded enormous influence in local and national politics, far more so than the holders of any other religious post. New York's archbishops have often had more clout than senators or cabinet members.</p>
        <p>Archbishop Egan, 68, has spent 12 years as bishop of Bridgeport, Conn., where he led in fostering Catholic-Jewish relations and also handled the delicate job of closing and merging several parishes; in New York, he may be glad for the political skills those experiences helped him develop.  Mr. Egan's predecessor in New York, Cardinal John O'Connor, was a master of the political give and take, and the turnout at his funeral on Monday rivaled that for a head of state.</p>
        <p>O'Connor was the most recent in a long line of bishop-politicians that traces its lineage to John Hughes, the combative working-class Irishman who presided over the archdiocese from 1839 to 1864.</p>
        <p>Hughes led the New York church during a time when Catholics, especially Irish Catholics, were regarded as an alien presence in America.  When Democrats ignored his requests in 1842 to curb the blatantly anti-Catholic religious curriculum being taught in the city schools, Hughes organized his own slate of candidates for the State Legislature, took to the stump himself, and swept the election. Hughes was also a one-man anti-discrimination league, standing up for Irish rights in public accommodations and hiring, especially in the building trades.</p>
        <p>As Hughes consolidated his spiritual and temporal power in New York, his national profile also rose. Presidents Franklin Pierce, James Buchanan and Abraham Lincoln consulted with Hughes on the issues of the day and occasionally called on him for diplomatic missions. Lincoln even lobbied the Vatican, unsuccessfully, to make Hughes a cardinal.</p>
        <p>Hughes's successors also wielded significant influence on politics. Archbishop Michael Corrigan kept close ties to Tammany Hall and in 1886 helped to mobilize Catholics against the mayoral candidacy of the reformer Henry George. And Cardinal Patrick Hayes used his Tammany connections to line up Democratic support in Congress for legislation protecting church-run schools in the Philippines in 1932.</p>
        <p>Cardinal Francis Spellman, who ran the diocese from 1939 to 1967, was considered the church's greatest politician and was portrayed as close to Franklin D. Roosevelt, John Foster Dulles, J. Edgar Hoover and important union leaders. Many Americans thought Spellman had a real shot at becoming pope. Though the cardinal wasn't the force he appeared to be in cold war politics, and policy makers considered him more of an irritant than an insider, he was ''always pushing and pushing,'' according to Paul Nitze, an architect of postwar foreign policy. Spellman was a supporter of Joseph McCarthy, and he used his connections aggressively on behalf of Catholic schools.</p>
        <p>O'Connor succeeded best in updating Hughes's methods for the media age. O'Connor was a master of turning adversaries into allies. Had he not been a priest, it is easy to imagine him as a senator or a governor.</p>
        <p>The real test for the new archbishop of New York is how well he maintains the position's power. It has been decades since Catholics voted as an identifiable bloc, and an archbishop's influence now depends as much on charisma as on the inherent power of his office. There are few bully pulpits to compare to the see of New York. Archbishop Egan has a very tough act to follow.</p>
