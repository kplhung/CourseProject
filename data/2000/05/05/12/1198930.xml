        <p>Taller Boricua Gallery at Julia De Burgos Cultural Center</p>
        <p>1680 Lexington Avenue, at 106th Street</p>
        <p>East Harlem</p>
        <p>Through May 20</p>
        <p>''Fresh Produce,'' organized by Yasmin Ramirez, serves as a compact extension to ''Latin American Still Life: Reflections of Time and Place'' at El Museo del Barrio (through May 21), further expanding the larger show's already broad formal scope.</p>
        <p>Luis Carle's hand-painted photographs of tropical fruits and vegetables are the most ''classical'' looking pieces here; they forge a contemporary link to the 19th-century still lifes by the Puerto Rican artist Francisco Oller. Javier Cintron makes a Caribbean connection explicit in his jazzy collage paintings spiced with Goya labels. Liza Papi embellishes her pinhole photographs of birthday and wedding cakes from Latino bakeries in Harlem with monoprint borders in confectionary colors.</p>

        <p>Two other artists deal in more abstract ways with still-life themes of nourishment, consumption and decay. In a crisp, lucid installation, Iliana Emilia turns bread and water into a yeasty version of stripped-down Donald Judd furniture. Enrique Renta sews shirts and trousers from cloth printed with images of raw meat. In this case fashion isn't about adorning the body with an attractive ''second skin'' but about revealing the unglamorous reality that we are what we kill and eat. Nature morte, indeed.</p>
