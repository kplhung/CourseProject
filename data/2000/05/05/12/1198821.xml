        <p>A Hasidic rabbi on parole in Rockland County after serving a prison term for kidnapping a teenager under his tutelage was deported to Israel yesterday, even as his conviction was being appealed, his lawyer said.</p>
        <p>The case of the rabbi, Shlomo Helbrans, has drawn widespread attention not only for the nature of the kidnapping charge, but also because of a federal investigation into whether his parole after two years in prison was the result of improper political influence on the Pataki administration.</p>
        <p>Immigration officials have sought to deport the rabbi since 1992, at first saying he had entered the country illegally in 1990, and later citing federal law that allows the deportation of convicted felons. On March 7, the Board of Immigration Appeal dismissed his final appeal of a deportation order.</p>
        <p>Rabbi Helbrans, 38, an Israeli citizen, was arrested Wednesday night by agents of the Immigration and Naturalization Service at the police station in Spring Valley, N.Y., where he had gone expecting a regular meeting with his parole officer, said Mark Thorn, an I.N.S. spokesman.  Yesterday, Rabbi Helbrans was put on a plane for Israel at 5:25 p.m., his lawyer, Ronald G. Russo, said.</p>
        <p>About an hour earlier, the rabbi's wife, Malka, was arrested and charged with obstructing governmental affairs and striking a federal agent at the Manhattan detention center where the rabbi had been held, Mr. Russo said.</p>
        <p>Mike Gilhooly, regional spokesman for the immigration agency, said he could not confirm that the rabbi was deported or that Mrs. Helbrans was arrested.</p>
        <p>The rabbi was convicted in State Supreme Court in Brooklyn in 1994 in the kidnapping of Shai Fhima Reuven, who disappeared in April 1992, when he was 13, after his mother sent him to a Brooklyn yeshiva run by the rabbi. When the boy resurfaced two years later, he said he had run away  from his mother, who he said had beaten him. The mother called the allegation a lie, and accused Rabbi Helbrans of brainwashing her son.</p>
        <p>After a November 1996 decision by the State Parole Board to release Rabbi Helbrans after two years in prison, the United States attorney's office began investigating whether the board had been influenced by a personal appeal from Leon Perlmutter, a fund-raiser for Gov. George E. Pataki in the Hasidic community. The Pataki administration has denied there was any improper influence. Federal officials said yesterday that the investigation was continuing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Russo, the rabbi's lawyer, said he was disturbed by his client's deportation because he thought he had an agreement with the immigration service to wait for the result of an  appeal of the kidnapping conviction in the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit.</p>
        <p>If the court overturns the conviction, Mr. Russo said, there would be no reason to deport Rabbi Helbrans,  who had lived with his wife and their six children in Monsey, N.Y. Mrs. Helbrans is six months pregnant, Mr. Russo said.</p>
        <p>A jury convicted Mrs. Helbrans of conspiring with her husband to hide the teenager, but the conviction was thrown out by the trial judge for lack of evidence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thorn of the immigration service declined to comment on Mr. Russo's assertions. Amy Otten, a spokeswoman for the agency in Washington, said there is no blanket policy on whether to withhold deportations pending criminal appeals.</p>
        <p>Rick Kenney, a spokesman for the Executive Office of Immigration Review, a sister agency to the immigration service, said that even if the kidnapping charge was overturned,  the deportation order still included an earlier charge that Rabbi Helbrans entered the country illegally on Sept. 14, 1990.</p>
        <p>''That charge still stands,'' Mr. Kenney said. But, he added, ''Because it was a less serious ground for deportation, he might be eligible for more forms of relief. So, yeah, if he's trying to get his kidnapping conviction overturned, that might make a difference.''</p>
        <p>Josef Goldman, a fellow Hasid in Monsey, where Rabbi Helbrans was  affiliated with the Lev Tahor yeshiva, said the community was ''very, very upset'' about the rabbi's arrest.  ''The I.N.S. is showing a very ugly face here, a very ugly face,'' he said.</p>
