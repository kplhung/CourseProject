        <p>''Coming Soon'' explores two phenomena that have inspired countless magazine articles and how-to guides, as well as widespread anxiety and fascination: the female orgasm and the Ivy League admissions process.</p>
        <p>Colette Burson's amiable new comedy, which opens today at Cinema Village, follows three seniors at the prestigious (and barely fictitious) Halton School in Manhattan as they struggle to find academic advancement and sexual fulfillment. The story focuses on a smart, winsome strawberry blonde named Stream (Bonnie Root), and what plot there is turns on her search.</p>
        <p>Since this is a romantic comedy -- imagine a collaboration between John Hughes and Whit Stillman in close consultation with the editors of ''Our Bodies, Our Selves'' -- the happy outcome is never in doubt, and the audience's pleasure along the way depends on the heroine's momentary frustration.</p>
        <p>The ironclad conventions of the genre demand that she transfer her affections from the bad rich boy (archetypally impersonated by James Spader in ''Pretty in Pink'' many years ago and here played by James Roday) to the social misfit whose true sensitivity is camouflaged in sullenness and sarcasm. Within the rarefied social world of Ms. Burson's script (written with Kate Robin), this role is filled by young Henry Rockefeller (Ryan Reynolds), who declares his rebellion by changing his last name to Lipschitz.</p>
        <p>''How Emilio Estevez,'' exclaims Stream's friend Jenny (Gaby Hoffmann), and it's not always clear whether the movie means to endorse her mockery or refute it. Henry, who sports a wispy hipster beard that vanishes and reappears from scene to scene, starts out as an annoying poseur, but by the end he's a rock 'n' roll dreamboat.</p>
        <p>Jenny herself is subjected to similarly whimsical treatment. Sometimes she's a self-absorbed, spoiled ninny, sometimes a fount of hard-headed feminine wisdom, sometimes a sad, lonely girl decked out in fishnet stockings and heels. But as portrayed by Ms. Hoffmann, who may be the Madeline Kahn of the Clearasil set, she's also the source of some of the film's best scenes, and the mouthpiece for its funniest lines. ''My father bought me a learning disorder'' is Jenny's blase explanation of why her low SAT scores won't keep her out of Brown.</p>
        <p>Even Ms. Hoffmann's estimable comic energies are overshadowed by Mia Farrow, her orange curls like a circus fright wig, who plays Stream's mother, Judy, as a batty bundle of New Age nostrums and neurotic rage. ''I feel 100 percent judgmental,'' this dogmatically nonjudgmental purveyor of countercultural toothpaste shrills when she discovers that her daughter is, as the saying goes, sexually active.</p>
        <p>But the movie's most exacting satiric judgment is reserved for Judy and her generation, which includes Spalding Gray as a pompous, self-promoting college admissions adviser and, briefly, Ryan O'Neal as Stream's father, predictably remarried to a predictably bubble-headed younger woman.</p>
        <p>Judy, meanwhile, is dating a tiresome ceramicist played by Peter Bogdanovich, who once directed Mr. O'Neal in a frothy romantic comedy called ''What's Up, Doc,'' which also starred Barbra Streisand, whose name is dropped in passing, as well as Madeline Kahn, whom we may one day regard as the Gaby Hoffmann of the 1970's.</p>
        <p>While ''Coming Soon'' takes up the cause of a later generation, it recalls the salutary candor of the 70's about sexuality, especially female sexuality. Its frank good humor stands in sharp contrast with the strange combination of timidity and exploitiveness of more widely distributed recent teenage comedies like ''Down to You,'' ''Whatever It Takes'' and ''Committed,'' which can't decide whether young women's sexual desires should be punished or ridiculed -- if they are even allowed to exist.</p>
        <p>Ms. Burson's pluck and honesty may indeed be the reasons that her film -- like Sarah Kernochan's ''All I Wanna Do,'' another unusually intelligent, unapologetically feminist vehicle for Ms. Hoffmann's talents -- has been pushed to the margins of the entertainment world. ''Coming Soon'' was passed over by several major studios and twice threatened with the dreaded NC-17 rating by the Motion Picture Association of America. It has now been released in an R-rated version by Unapix Films.</p>
        <p>There is nothing gratuitous or graphic on the screen -- no nudity, no skimpy starlet get-ups, nothing but respect, in fact, for the young women who make up its cast and its intended audience.</p>
        <p>To be sure, ''Coming Soon'' has its share of loose ends and its longueurs. Given her subject matter, Ms. Burson might have been a bit more attentive to narrative rhythms. No, the earth doesn't move, but at least you don't feel used afterward.</p>
        <p>''Coming Soon'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It includes several brief sexual scenes, some drug use and many lengthy discussions of sexual matters.</p>
