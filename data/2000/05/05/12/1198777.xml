        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''High Rewards and High Costs as States Draw Autistic Pupils'' (front page, May 6), you state that the autism treatment most in demand is applied behavior analysis. However, you do not say that it is the only treatment intervention for autism that has withstood scientific scrutiny for more than 30 years.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''High Rewards and High Costs as States Draw Autistic Pupils'' (front page, May 6), you state that the autism treatment most in demand is applied behavior analysis. However, you do not say that it is the only treatment intervention for autism that has withstood scientific scrutiny for more than 30 years.</p>
        <p>Just like cancer patients seeking chemotherapy, parents seeking applied behavior analysis programs for their children are after effective, scientifically validated intervention. If these interventions were not readily available, patients would migrate to centers that provided them.</p>
        <p>By ignoring the research, the educational system has failed to meet the profound needs of people with autism. If the diagnosis were cancer, this would not be tolerated. Why should parents settle for anything less when the diagnosis is autism?</p>
