        <p>''Good business is the best art,'' said Andy Warhol, who might have been an accountant if he hadn't been an artist. His once-provocative words would probably sound common-sensical to an M.F.A. candidate today. At present they are serving as the title for an exhibition at the Bronx Museum of the Arts.</p>
        <p>The show, organized by Marysol Nieves and Lydia Yee, celebrates the 20th anniversary of the museum's Artist in the Marketplace program (AIM, for short), intended to coach emerging artists in the byzantine process of establishing a career.</p>
        <p>The program's drill is as follows. Every year, three dozen artists are chosen to participate in a 12-week seminar led by the museum's curatorial staff and an assortment of art world guests, who advise on everything from landing a gallery to writing grants to dealing with irksome realities like taxes and critics. As a parting gesture, the museum gives the artists a group show, a symbolic launching pad.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the future happens fast. Several recent program alumni can be spotted in high-profile shows around town just now, from the Whitney Biennial (Rina Banerjee, 1996), to ''Greater New York'' at P.S. 1 (Mark Dean Veca, 1997; Nicole Awai and Nadine Robinson, both 1998), to ''Making Choices'' at the Museum of Modern Art (Katharina Bosse, 1998, and Glenn Ligon, 1984).</p>
        <p>Three of Mr. Ligon's text-based paintings about racial identity open the Bronx survey. Dating from 1990, they have acquired near-canonical status in the art of that period, as has the work of other AIM veterans seen here. Byron Kim's skin-colored abstract paintings and evocations of Asian-American immigrant life by Tomie Arai and Lynne Yamamoto are history book material.</p>
        <p>It may be hard to see such icons with fresh eyes in the context of the Bronx Museum's episodic sampler. But it is intriguing to learn that all of these artists were shaped by the same institutional environment, and to find as one moves through the rest of the show that their basic concerns continue to be explored, if in more oblique terms, by their successors.</p>
        <p>Ms. Banerjee's ''Postcolonial-Spider-Broom Woman,'' for example, a fantastic web of gauze, beads and industrial tubing, has many things to say about the dangers and seductions of exoticism, but says them indirectly. An installation by Ernesto Pujol titled ''Peter Pan's Table'' approaches the anxieties of a homosexual childhood with sly, theatrical wit: sculptures of male genitals are lined up like pastries on a little wooden desk, with a punishing pair of scissors lying nearby.</p>
        <p>Lane Twitchell, who is in his early 30's, draws on his Mormon background in imaginative ways. A substantial selection of his output has been brought together here, from a straightforward portrait painting he contributed to the 1997 AIM group show to some of the elaborate, image-packed cut-paper pieces he has done since.</p>
        <p>The formal intricacy of Mr. Twitchell's recent work, with its painstaking use of repetition and detail, finds echoes elsewhere: in Seong Chun's sculptures crocheted from text-covered strips of paper, in Valeska Soares's bundles of thorny branches swathed in cotton batting and in Sarah Sosnowy's mural-size, circles-within-circles mandala formed from dozens of smaller paintings.</p>
        <p>Painting has itself always held an important place in AIM exhibitions, and it does so here. An anarchic, attention-grabbing concoction by Fabian Marcaccio (silicone gel, printed fabric and plaster are among the  ingredients) stumbles off the canvas and tears across the wall. By contrast, a sexy wall piece by Paul Henry Ramirez is executed with the pin-point precision of an Islamic miniature.</p>
        <p>Photography is the odd-medium-out here, though there are first-rate entries by Laura Larson, and Ms. Bosse, who was born in Finland, comes across as a particularly versatile artist. She is represented by two very different architectural series made five years apart, and neither resembles the striking figurative images she showed at the Bronx Museum in 1998.</p>
        <p>These artists are just the tip of the AIM iceberg. Work by dozens of their colleagues is also included in the roundup, in slide format or displayed in flat files. The slides, set out on light boxes, are a little difficult to see, but give a sense of the sheer variety of sensibilities that have passed through the museum over a couple of decades. The material in the flat files naturally has a more immediate presence and is well worth spending time with.</p>
        <p>Several artists seen in the main exhibition are represented here. But so are AIM graduates equally worthy of mainstage attention, among them Brian Mukerjee, Nicole Carstens, Brian Guidry, Skowmon Hastanan, Matthew Deleget, Max-Carlos Martinez, Valerie Atkisson and Tamara Mewis. Some have gone on to bigger things. They all look good here. And they are all part of an important history.</p>
        <p>On July 13, the 20th annual Artist in the Market show will open in the museum's lower galleries, and will run concurrently with the anniversary gathering through the summer. They make sense together. One speaks of solid accomplishment; the other promises surprises. That's a business-as-usual combination for art in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>''Good Business Is the Best Art: 20 Years of the Artist in the Marketplace Program'' is at the Bronx Museum of the Arts, 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, (718) 681-6000, through Sept. 3.</p>
