        <p>Lehmann Maupin</p>
        <p>39 Greene Street, SoHo</p>
        <p>Through May 26</p>
        <p>Bonnie Collura's sculptures, made mostly of foam, plaster and putty covered with gravy-thick paint, are like multi-vehicle collisions. Baroque sculpture, Disney animation and Butler's ''Lives of the Saints'' seem to have met at meltdown speed, leaving stray limbs and maimed myths protruding from the wreckage.</p>
        <p>The results are dramatically abject. One large piece titled ''Chain Reaction,'' cappuccino-colored and modular, suggests a chunk of architectural ornament, dropped from on high and spewing forth angels and cartoon heads. The two-part ''Totem,'' simultaneously engorged and limp, rises from the floor and descends from the ceiling.</p>

        <p>Lehmann Maupin</p>
        <p>39 Greene Street, SoHo</p>
        <p>Through May 26</p>
        <p>Bonnie Collura's sculptures, made mostly of foam, plaster and putty covered with gravy-thick paint, are like multi-vehicle collisions. Baroque sculpture, Disney animation and Butler's ''Lives of the Saints'' seem to have met at meltdown speed, leaving stray limbs and maimed myths protruding from the wreckage.</p>
        <p>The results are dramatically abject. One large piece titled ''Chain Reaction,'' cappuccino-colored and modular, suggests a chunk of architectural ornament, dropped from on high and spewing forth angels and cartoon heads. The two-part ''Totem,'' simultaneously engorged and limp, rises from the floor and descends from the ceiling.</p>
        <p>''Snowman'' in the back gallery fuses classical musculature with decomposing flesh, with bunches of plastic Easter grass sprouting from joints and orifices as a final, festive indignity.</p>
        <p>In the past Ms. Collura has supplied her sculptures, and the vivid ink drawings that accompany them, with tangled narratives, though she seems to have held back this time. The stories gave the earlier works a tight, almost throttling energy. Now the viewer gets to bring more to them.</p>
        <p>The results are a bit like the marginal figures in medieval manuscripts (Ms. Collura has made a similar comparison): grotesque, funny, proto-Pop visitants from the spiritual underbelly, where icons relax and belief can stop making sense.</p>
