      <abstract>
        <p>Thomas L Friedman Op-Ed column says presidential candidates should be forced to address the issues of tomorrow: those that will arise from forces unleashed by e-commerce, biotech revolution, information revolution and global integration</p>

        <p>When the Industrial Revolution came along it shaped the contours of several U.S. elections. Although our current election comes at the dawn of the information and biotech revolutions, you'd never quite know it from the presidential campaign, which has been almost a parallel universe, operating on its own news and historical logic. It has been characterized either by the arcane -- the Confederate flag and Bob Jones -- or by the evergreens -- Social Security, campaign finance reform, abortion and gun control. There is a general sense that not much is at stake in this election, and that we have entered an era of good feelings and tiny differences.</p>
        <p>This is an illusion. My gut tells me that by 2008 we will look back at the Clinton years as a fool's paradise -- the quiet interlude after the cold war and before all the forces unleashed by e-commerce, the biotech revolution, the information revolution and global integration reached their critical mass and ushered in a period of radically new political choices and issues in U.S. and global politics.</p>

        <p>When the Industrial Revolution came along it shaped the contours of several U.S. elections. Although our current election comes at the dawn of the information and biotech revolutions, you'd never quite know it from the presidential campaign, which has been almost a parallel universe, operating on its own news and historical logic. It has been characterized either by the arcane -- the Confederate flag and Bob Jones -- or by the evergreens -- Social Security, campaign finance reform, abortion and gun control. There is a general sense that not much is at stake in this election, and that we have entered an era of good feelings and tiny differences.</p>
        <p>This is an illusion. My gut tells me that by 2008 we will look back at the Clinton years as a fool's paradise -- the quiet interlude after the cold war and before all the forces unleashed by e-commerce, the biotech revolution, the information revolution and global integration reached their critical mass and ushered in a period of radically new political choices and issues in U.S. and global politics.</p>
        <p>Look at the headlines on the eve of this 2000 election: The ''love bug'' virus, launched by a student in the Philippines, wipes out in a few hours millions of dollars' worth of files on 10 million computers all over the world.</p>
        <p>The next day we read that the Internet is giving way to the Evernet, meaning that anything with electricity is having chips embedded in it -- from pagers to toasters to cars -- and connected to networks. The new Mercedes 500 has more computing power in it than the 747-200. Not only will this mean that you will always be able to surf the Web everywhere, but it is also going to mean that the Web will be able to surf you, and know where you are, and what you are consuming, everywhere all the time. And the faster and more diffused networks become, the more vulnerable we all are, not to Big Brother but to the Little Brothers -- the Web site, the video store, the hacker, the credit card company that can amass and sell your personal data with little government restraint. This is going to raise huge privacy issues.</p>
        <p>And if, as The Times reported Wednesday, ''Freenet'' technology really comes about it will be possible to acquire or exchange any kind of digitized music, book, video, software or data over the Internet, without paying any royalty to any publisher, filmmaker or anyone. It could mean the end of copyright.</p>
        <p>The next day we read that we are soon going to have a single, global 24-hour stock market. Regulated by whom? And the next day we find that the 10-year project to decode the human genome, the operating manual for how human beings are constructed, is about to be completed, giving us the ability not only to cure disease in a new way but also to design offspring and change human nature.</p>
        <p>''The biotech revolution raises big moral issues that scream out for international governance and a common agreement on rules,'' notes Francis Fukuyama, author of ''The End of History.'' We don't want to just leave this to the market and have people designing babies in the Cayman Islands, he adds, but there is no global means to regulate this yet.</p>
        <p>Indeed, what all these issues have in common is that we will all be affected by these radical changes, and they can really only be regulated through global institutions, but none exist today. We are all increasingly connected, but nobody's quite in charge. And when everyone is more tightly connected, but not everyone is more tightly governed, small units can wreak large havoc -- the love bug. Which is why this new era is going to actually demand more global governance, not less. But how and in what form?</p>
        <p>These issues have not quite ripened into hard political choices yet, so one can't fault the candidates for not discussing them frontally. But as society is reshaped by these forces, and the future becomes the present, this era of small differences will burst right open.</p>
        <p>Maybe we could have three debates this season. One would be called ''Mudslinging,'' during which both candidates could unleash any lie, exaggeration or personal attack against the other. The next could be called ''Golden Oldies,'' which would focus on the still relevant evergreens, from Social Security to abortion. And lastly, we could have the ''Tomorrowland'' debate, in which each candidate would have to present his thoughts on the new issues that will actually be shaping his presidency before it's over.</p>
