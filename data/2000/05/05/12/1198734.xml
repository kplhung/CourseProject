        <p>MOTHERKIND  By Jayne Anne Phillips  295 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $24.</p>
        <p>In fierce, magical works like ''Black Tickets'' (1979) and ''Machine Dreams'' (1984) Jayne Anne Phillips depicted characters torn between the dream of home -- ''a two-lane road densely overhung with the deciduous trees of a more familiar world'' -- and the dream of escape.

        <p>MOTHERKIND  By Jayne Anne Phillips  295 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $24.</p>
        <p>In fierce, magical works like ''Black Tickets'' (1979) and ''Machine Dreams'' (1984) Jayne Anne Phillips depicted characters torn between the dream of home -- ''a two-lane road densely overhung with the deciduous trees of a more familiar world'' -- and the dream of escape. Restless survivors of the 60's, these people found themselves on the road, on the move, on the lam, and yet their very rootlessness and dislocation left them haunted by the families and vanished small-town worlds they had tried to leave behind.</p>
        <p>Though Kate, the heroine of Ms. Phillips's disappointing new novel, shares an emotional resume with her earlier creations -- a girlhood in Appalachia, years of aimless wandering, a sense of fragmentation and loss -- she has now settled down to a life of quiet domesticity in the outskirts of Boston. She has become what her husband, Matt, calls ''the Queen of Safety'': she has ''circled the wagons'' around her family, and wants ''everything absolutely tacked down,'' as she struggles to take care of her newborn son and her ailing mother, Katherine.</p>
        <p>In the hands of writers like John Updike, Anne Tyler and Alice Munro, this sort of bourgeois existence has provided the makings of a compelling fictional world. But in Ms. Phillips's case, the mundane routines of daily life do not fully engage her imagination. As a result, her decision to take a sort of ''Mrs. Dalloway'' approach to Kate's story, minutely recounting her every move and mood, feels claustrophobic and static: a litany of a stressed-out woman's struggles with diapers, baby prams, spoiled stepchildren, her mother's pain medication and her own vagrant feelings.</p>
        <p>''MotherKind'' has none of the hypnotic gothicism that gave ''Black Tickets'' and ''Shelter'' a subversive undertow, and the bulk of its scenes, which take place in or near Boston, lack the sure sense of place that lent books like ''Machine Dreams'' a specific gravity and weight. In fact Ms. Phillips, who grew up in a small West Virginia town much like the ones featured in her earlier work, demonstrates little feel for New England in this volume: it's a generic, yuppified world, defined vaguely by changing seasons and elaborately celebrated holidays.</p>
        <p>For some reason Ms. Phillips has chosen not to use her superb gifts as a ventriloquist in ''MotherKind'': her characters do not talk to us in the first person, as they have in so many of her previous books, but are viewed through the distancing scrim of an omniscient narrative that lends their thinking a strangely portentous, second-hand feel.</p>
        <p>''Kate sometimes imagined herself a flat meadow ravaged by wildfire, an unsuspecting meadow,'' Ms. Phillips writes. ''For years, she'd avoided babies, which was easy, because most women she knew didn't have them. Most women thought they were looking for men, not babies. Kate thought now that they were wrong: they were all looking for babies, even those who said they didn't want children, or didn't like them.''</p>
        <p>Kate finds herself becoming a new mother and her own mother's caretaker at the same time. As a girl she had been her mother's confidante -- privy to the secrets of her parents' failing marriage -- and now, she vows, she will be her mother's partner ''in this long dance, this last boat trip.'' As Katherine grows weaker and weaker, the roles of mother and daughter are reversed. It is Kate who must monitor her mother's medication schedule and encourage her to eat; it is Kate who tends life in the house, trying to balance the demands of her mother, her son, her husband and his two children. Her own work as a poet recedes, as that ''alternate world'' of words, of association and image, takes a back seat to her familial duties.</p>
        <p>In much the same way that she used her sensual imagination to evoke the humid atmosphere of adolescence in ''Shelter,'' so Ms. Phillips evokes the mysteries of pregnancy, birth and motherhood in these pages: the hormonal haze, the heightening of memory and expectation. Yet when she turns to the actual facts of Kate's life -- going to the mall, preparing for an Easter party, taking the children to the beach -- her poetic gifts falter, giving way to flat-footed even perfunctory recitations of tasks performed and noted. To make matters worse, her looping narrative, which continually moves back and forth in time in small, jerky flashbacks, impedes the forward momentum of the novel without adding much in the way of felt emotion. The short scenes set back home in Appalachia, while finely written, simply point up the pallor of the scenes set in Boston.</p>
        <p>It is only in the last quarter of the book, as the illness of Kate's mother accelerates, and Ms. Phillips focuses on the intricacy of the mother-daughter bond, that the reader's sympathy is truly engaged. These final pages have an immediacy lacking in the remainder of the book, an unflinching willingness to look at the complex machinery of familial relations and the obdurate fact of mortality, and they remind the reader of the author's enormous gifts as a writer, gifts that are sadly hidden in the remainder of this volume.</p>
