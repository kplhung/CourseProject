      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy Broadway and Off Broadway shows this weekend. Approximate running times are in parentheses. * denotes a highly recommended show.  + means discounted tickets were available at the Theater Development Fund's TKTS booth last weekend for performances last Friday and Saturday nights.</p>
        <p>Broadway</p>
        <p>* ''CONTACT.'' The most potent antidepressant available in New York. Advertising has it that this show from the director and choreographer Susan Stroman is a ''dance play,'' but that hardly captures how it makes you feel. Aided by the dramatist John Weidman and a dream ensemble, Ms. Stroman has created the unthinkable: a sexy, polished work that restores the pleasure principle to the American musical. A theatrical portfolio of three seemingly unrelated vignettes set in different time periods, with top-drawer leading performances from Boyd Gaines, Deborah Yates and Karen Ziemba, ''Contact'' uses an ingeniously selected medley of recordings ranging from Bizet to the Beach Boys. But like a classic Rodgers and Hart musical it converts the messy daily ingredients of sexual attraction and conflict into something as smoothly sweet and tart as a Key lime pie. Both the intoxication of love and the hangover of loneliness are given idealized, elegant form as ''Contact'' weaves romance from a reality we are all familiar with (2:00). Beaumont, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 and $80 (Ben Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''COPENHAGEN.'' Who would ever have thought it: that three dead, long-winded people talking about atomic physics would be such electrifying companions? Michael Frayn's endlessly fascinating speculation on the ambiguity of human motives and the limits of scientific knowledge takes on a subject that would seem to have the sex appeal of a frozen flounder: a meeting in 1941 between the Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Philip Bosco) and Werner Heisenberg (Michael Cumpsty), his former protege and a German, during which no one, to this day, knows exactly what happened. Mr. Frayn turns the encounter among the men and Bohr's wife, Margrethe (Blair Brown), into a wide-ranging, intensely emotional consideration of everything from quantum mechanics to the loss of a child, from the fate of the world in the atomic age to the nature of friendship. Under the meticulous direction of Michael Blakemore, with three fiercely passionate performances, the result is a most invigorating and ingenious play of ideas (2:20). Royale, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $50 to $65; $25 student rush tickets at box office on day of performance (Brantley).</p>

Michael Frayn's endlessly fascinating speculation on the ambiguity of human motives and the limits of scientific knowledge takes on a subject that would seem to have the sex appeal of a frozen flounder: a meeting in 1941 between the Danish physicist Niels Bohr (Philip Bosco) and Werner Heisenberg (Michael Cumpsty), his former protege and a German, during which no one, to this day, knows exactly what happened.

Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $50 to $65; $25 student rush tickets at box office on day of performance (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''DIRTY BLONDE.'' Stand up, boys, and take your hats off. Mae West is back on Broadway, in this compact Rolls-Royce of a vehicle written by and starring Claudia Shear. Eight decades after a play with the forthright title ''Sex'' landed her in jail, West is proving that she still has the power to shock and delight. She has also, not incidentally, provided the inspiration for what is hands down the best new American play of the season. This tale of an icon and two of her idolizers (played by Ms. Shear and Kevin Chamberlin) is no evening of mere impersonation; it's not ''Mae West Tonight!'' What Ms. Shear and her director, James Lapine, have shaped is a multilayered study of the nature of stardom. With Bob Stillman rounding out the protean three-member ensembled, ''Dirty Blonde'' presents one of the canniest portraits on record of that floating dialogue between icons and idolizers that remains so much a part of American culture (1:45). Helen Hayes, 240 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6262. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 and $60 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>* ''THE MUSIC MAN.'' A show that makes you feel ridiculously happy one instant and seriously sleepy the next. The director and choreographer Susan Stroman, who created the inspired dance-musical ''Contact,'' isn't as confident in her take on Meredith Willson's jubilant story of a traveling con man who brings rhythm to the stolid town of River City, Iowa. Her transforming imagination stops when the music stops. The production has two perfectly agreeable stars in Craig Bierko, in the title role, and Rebecca Luker, as the frosty librarian who learns to melt. But you get the impression that most of the people onstage are just pretending to live in a land of cornfed propriety and corny jokes, marking time until a production number comes along to let them show their stuff. When the show is singing or, especially, dancing, it often seems to have winged feet; when it's just talking or clowning around, those feet are flat (2:50). Neil Simon, 250 West 52nd Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $20 and $85 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>*+ ''THE RIDE DOWN MOUNT MORGAN.'' As Lyman Felt, the joyously eloquent, sexually rapacious and relentlessly self-justifying bigamist at this ride's center, Patrick Stewart makes a fine devil for a new millennium. A man who wants everything and can deny himself nothing, Lyman suffers as a result, but in the end, well, the pleasure of living his carefully maintained double life was probably worth its ultimate destruction. In intelligent and savage satire, the play makes a pretty good case for bigamy as a lifestyle choice. And it is the achievement of Mr. Stewart that such stunning amorality seems nearly reasonable. It's hard to imagine a more sympathetic creep (2:10). Ambassador, 215 West 49th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $55 and $65 (Bruce Weber).</p>
        <p>+ ''TALLER THAN A DWARF.'' Given the comic credentials of the playwright, Elaine May, the director, Alan Arkin, and the star, Matthew Broderick, this is a stunning disaster. The story of an ordinary man from Queens on the day his midlife crisis comes home to roost, it is crippled by gag-based scenes, dialogue that seems to have been written with a laugh track to be inserted later and characters whose motivations for saying and doing anything are either trivial, contrived or obscured until it's too late to care (1:35).  Longacre, 220 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $25 to $65 (Weber).</p>
        <p>+ ''UNCLE VANYA.'' Anton Chekhov, meet Henny Youngman. The director Michael Mayer's ill-advised new interpretation of the 1897 drama for the Roundabout Theater Company, which manages to dim even the luster of the extraordinary British actor Sir Derek Jacobi, seems determined to trace the borscht belt back to Mother Russia. This is a world of stand-up sufferers who never look more contented than when expounding on their profound unhappiness directly to the audience from the center of the stage. Get thee behind me, Stanislavski. The evening, which also features Laura Linney and Brian Murray, offers a few lightning flashes that illuminate the anguish in the forced frivolity, mostly from Sir Derek and Roger Rees. But by and large, you don't believe that these noisy showoffs even know one another, much less that they are capable of inflicting deep mutual pain (2:40). Brooks Atkinson, 256 West 47th Street, (212) 307-4100. Tuesdays through Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 2 p.m. Tickets: $50 to $65 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>Off Broadway</p>
        <p>* ''JITNEY.'' ''Don't put your business in the street,'' advises a character in this splendidly acted production of August Wilson's early comic drama about a gypsy-cab company in Pittsburgh. As if that were remotely possible in the Hill District, the setting of Mr. Wilson's cycle of plays about the black American experience in the 20th century and a place where private business is always on parade: real life is always the best show in town. ''Jitney,'' which has been extensively revised since its first production in 1982, could be described as just a lot of men sitting around talking. But the talk has such varied range and musicality, and it is rendered with such stylish detail, that a complete urban symphony emerges. There are occasional whiffs of standard-issue melodrama. But under Marion McClinton's sensitive direction, every performer shines as a soloist and as a member of the chorus. It's the finest ensemble work of the season (2:35). Second Stage, 307 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422. Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m.; Wednesdays at 2 and 7 p.m.; and Saturdays at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sundays at 3 p.m. Tickets: $41 and $51 (Brantley).</p>
        <p>''WAKE UP AND SMELL THE COFFEE.'' In this shrewd and bristly performance piece, Eric Bogosian turns his gimlet eye upon himself and finds himself wanting, complicit in the cultural wasteland he abhors. The interesting effect is a kind of sympathy for the businessmen, drug dealers, evangelists, street people and suburbanites he has so memorably skewered in the past (2:00). Jane Street, 113 Jane Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 239-6200. Tuesdays through Thursdays at 8 p.m.; Fridays at 8 and 11 p.m.; Saturdays at 7 and 10 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $29.50 to $49.50 (Weber).</p>
        <p>Last Chance</p>
        <p>+ ''AMADEUS.'' Certain actors seem haloed in heat, even in cold climates. In the less-than-fiery new revival of Peter Shaffer's popular drama of musical genius and cancerous envy, the young Welshman Michael Sheen, playing Mozart, projects the kind of air-warping waves given off by blacktop in the August sun. Mozart becomes the solar center of this production, directed by Peter Hall, which is odd when you remember that in the play's previous incarnations (and in the 1984 movie) it was the character of Salieri, Mozart's contemporary and nemesis, who always dominated. Here David Suchet exudes a low-luster archness in his many expository monologues that he brings to mind a docent in a museum. It doesn't help that Mr. Shaffer has revised his play to give Salieri a redemptive conscience; scale down the man's villainy and you lose the histrionic fireworks that make ''Amadeus'' so much fun (2:45). Music Box, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200. Through Sunday. Tonight at 8; tomorrow at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $50 to $70; $25 student rush (Brantley).</p>
