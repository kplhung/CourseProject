        <p>The Xerox Corporation, besieged by competition and a battered stock price, ousted its chief executive, G. Richard Thoman, yesterday.</p>
        <p>Anne M. Mulcahy, 47, head of the company's general markets organization, was named president and chief operating officer. Because those were the titles Mr. Thoman held before being named chief executive, Ms. Mulcahy's promotion seemed to elevate her to heir apparent.</p>
        <p>''We have not and are not going to look outside for the next C.E.O.,'' said Paul A. Allaire, the chairman, who has assumed the chief executive post for now.</p>
        <p>The ouster apparently took Mr. Thoman, 55, by surprise. In an interview last Friday,  he acknowledged that Ms. Mulcahy ''has a good chance at being my successor'' but made it clear that he expected to remain chief executive for some time.</p>
        <p>''The board and I agreed,'' Mr. Thoman said in an interview yesterday, ''that it made more sense to implement our strategy with an internal team. And I'm a very big shareholder, and a lot of my future net worth is dependent on how well Paul and Anne do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Allaire, who preceded Mr. Thoman as chief executive, said the board moved now to install the new team in time for the company's annual meeting next Thursday. But analysts said they were concerned that more was at play.</p>
        <p>''You have to wonder if April's numbers turned out to be a lot worse than they expected,'' said Gibboney Huske, an analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thoman's 13-month reign at Xerox has been marked by more troubles than triumphs. Xerox hired him away from I.B.M. in 1997 to be president of the company, with the clear understanding that he would succeed Mr. Allaire as chief executive. It was the first time the company, which is based in Stamford, Conn., had put an outsider in its top slot, and Mr. Thoman was expected to churn out new products and technologies and generally invigorate the stodgy culture at Xerox.</p>
        <p>Instead, the company has had weak sales overseas, particularly in Brazil. In the United States, fierce competition has kept prices down for printers and lower-end copiers. Even the Xerox Docutech line of superfast digital copiers, which command prices well over $200,000, is facing competition: both Canon Inc. and Heidelberger Druckmaschinen A.G., which bought Eastman Kodak's copier business last year, now have high-speed products.</p>
        <p>''I was convinced Thoman wouldn't survive the year,'' said Brian L. Merriman, president of Danka Business Systems, one of Canon's main distributors. ''If they're going to get aggressive, flexible and fast enough to compete with the Japanese, they'll need a new management team.''</p>
        <p>Xerox has also faced internal tumult. It has eliminated more than 14,000 jobs in the last two years to reduce costs. It consolidated many back-office operations last year, causing backlogs in accounts receivables and billing problems. And it rejiggered its sales territories, long organized by geography, around customer industries. Chaos has resulted, as sales representatives try to acquaint themselves with new accounts.</p>
        <p>The company has also been slow to increase sales on its Web page. ''Their e-business strategy hasn't been clear to customers or to the street,'' said Stephen Goldstein, vice president of Renaissance Strategy, a consulting firm that has worked with Xerox.</p>
        <p>Shares of Xerox, which traded in triple digits two years ago, have been in free fall for the last year. The stock closed yesterday at $25.50 a share, down $2.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mulcahy would not be her industry's first woman executive -- Carly Fiorina, the chief executive at Hewlett-Packard, to whom Ms. Mulcahy bears an uncanny physical resemblance, got there first. But Ms. Mulcahy has scored a number of firsts in her 24-year career with Xerox.</p>
        <p>She has run sales territories in New York City and Boston that had long been male bastions. In 1985, as head of the Xerox human resources organization, she became the company's first female officer. Last year, she led Xerox's first forays onto the Internet.</p>
        <p>Now she leads the company's fastest growing new entity, the general markets organization -- a $6 billion business, started in January 1999, that concentrates on selling Xerox products to small businesses and consumers. That means pushing Xerox into superstores like CompUSA and other distribution channels that have long been Hewlett's forte.</p>
        <p>Earlier this year Ms. Mulcahy masterminded the purchase of Tektronix, a $1 billion business that finally gave Xerox a line of color printers to compete with Hewlett.</p>
        <p>Those who know her offer laundry lists of her positive qualities. But many question whether her experience is broad enough to run Xerox.</p>
        <p>''Anne is incredibly open and honest,'' said David A. Nadler, chairman of the Delta Consulting Group, which has done work for Xerox. ''But she's not a technologist, and she's never been heavily into product development.''</p>
        <p>James W. Lundy, a research director at Gartner and a former Xerox employee, said: ''She certainly has leadership and motivational skills. But she's been at Xerox an awfully long time, and that doesn't give her an outside perspective.''</p>
        <p>An outside perspective did not help Mr. Thoman much. ''We haven't implemented strategies as well as we should have, and I think Rick Thoman's being an outsider was part of the problem,'' Mr. Allaire said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thoman agreed. ''It's hard when you come into a company with a proud heritage and a long culture,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For her part, Ms. Mulcahy said: ''I know the Xerox team well. I know how to get things done, and I clearly intend to stay focused on flawless execution.''</p>
        <p>She may be inheriting a company on the mend. Jonathan Rosenzweig, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, said, ''It's got two new color copiers that will be gangbuster successes, and a platform of digital copiers that are truly cost competitive.''</p>
        <p>In March, Xerox announced an alliance with the Sharp Corporation and with FujiXerox, a joint venture with the Fuji Photo Film Company, to make inexpensive ink jet printers. Last month, Xerox and the Microsoft Corporation said they would create a joint venture company, ContentGuard, to produce and market software that protects copyrighted materials like books, music and video distributed over the Internet.</p>
        <p>First-quarter earnings were a pleasant surprise, too. The company's income before previously announced charges fell to $220 million, or 30 cents a diluted share, compared with $343 million, or 48 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. But analysts had not expected it to top 25 cents a share. Revenue was up 3 percent, to $4.43 billion, which many investors took as a sign that Xerox was finally back in growth mode.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 13, 2000, Saturday  An article in Business Day yesterday about management changes at Xerox referred imprecisely to its stock price. Xerox split 2 for 1 in January 1999. Thus, as adjusted, it would have been trading around $60 two years ago, not in the triple digits.</p>
