        <p>The man accused of masterminding the largest insurance fraud in American history, Martin R. Frankel, now insists his complex financial dealings were a legitimate effort to feed the world's hungry.</p>
        <p>In his first interview since his capture eight months ago in Germany, Mr. Frankel portrayed himself as a victim, saying he had been brought low by a charitable nature and a tendency to trust others too much. ''Probably the main reason that I'm here,'' he said, from inside the Hamburg jail where he is being held, ''is that I love people too much.''</p>
        <p>Prosecutors have charged him with bilking insurance companies of more than $200 million in a scheme they say involved several priests, a high Vatican judge and a fake charity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frankel was interviewed in Germany this week by Brian Ross, chief investigative correspondent for ABC News. A videotape of the interview, scheduled to be shown tonight on ''20/20,'' was made available to The New York Times under a collaborative agreement between the news organizations.</p>
        <p>In the interview, Mr. Frankel never directly denied the charges against him, which include fraud, money laundering, conspiracy and racketeering.</p>
        <p>Instead, he said that a life sentence, which he could receive, would violate ''human dignity and human rights.''</p>
        <p>Appearing on camera with a scraggly beard and silver-rimmed glasses askew, the 45-year-old former stockbroker offered a defiant case for leniency, saying that his supposed crimes were only financial.  ''There is no violence,'' he said. ''No one is murdered. No one is killed. No one is physically harmed.''</p>
        <p>United States prosecutors say that Mr. Frankel built an elaborate criminal empire using a financial trust, a brokerage house and a Catholic charity with links to the Vatican as fronts to buy small Southern insurance companies, which he then drained of more than $200 million in assets. From his Greenwich, Conn., home, he used the money to buy luxury cars, fur coats for his girlfriends, and eventually $16 million in diamonds and gold to finance his flight through Europe, according to a 36-count indictment issued last October by the United States Attorney's office in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Frankel declined to discuss the specific charges against him during the interview, his remarks offer a curious psychological portrait of an alternately grandiose, glib and self-pitying figure. ''I wish that I didn't have this incredible ability to predict things in the markets,'' he said, ''because then I never would have gotten into this position.''</p>
        <p>In the 35-minute interview, Mr. Frankel said that his goal was never to get rich but to ''feed all the hungry people in the world; that's the truth.''</p>
        <p>''Or at least, try to,'' he continued. ''That was my goal of my whole life.''</p>
        <p>He said that he granted the interview because he wanted to make the case that it was against German law  for him to be extradited. ''Under German law,'' he said, ''no human being arrested in Germany can be sent back to a country where they will either execute him, or put him in jail for the rest of his life.''</p>
        <p>One of his German lawyers, Dirk Meinicke, when reached by phone in Hamburg, said of Mr. Frankel's statement, ''It's his opinion.'' He added that he had advised Mr. Frankel not to speak with ABC.</p>
        <p>A high state court in Hamburg has approved Mr. Frankel's extradition, but Mr. Frankel must first stand trial next month on charges of passport fraud and customs-tax evasion.  The authorities said Mr. Frankel had nine false passports with him and a cache of diamonds when he was arrested on Sept. 4 at a luxury hotel in Hamburg.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the United States Attorney's office, Delcie Thiebault, said yesterday that she would not comment on Mr. Frankel's remarks but that the process of extradition was ''under way.''</p>
        <p>Conditions in the jail, where Mr. Frankel spends his days alone in a cell, wearing the same blue shirt and khakis in which he was arrested, are far from the conspicuous luxury of his past life.</p>
        <p>For six years, he ran a stock-trading business from his mansion, hiring submissive female companions to do office work, indulge his taste for sado-masochistic sex, and bait potential business partners.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frankel said, however, that he was loyal and loving to these women, and supported them financially even after he stopped dating them. ''I wanted a woman who loved me, who respected me, who wanted to stand by me and stick with me and be with me forever,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His scheme soon collapsed, according to legal documents and a diary that he maintained in the margins of a 1999 astrology guide that was turned over by a travel companion to the F.B.I. The diary documents how state regulators from Mississippi and Tennessee grew suspicious, asking to see how he had invested the premiums from various insurance companies. He also notes death threats and attempts at blackmail by various colleagues alongside notes about bizarre sexual acts, scheduled haircuts and visits to his mother in Toledo, Ohio.</p>
        <p>To persuade Mississippi regulators of his solvency, he had a member of the Vatican Supreme Tribunal, who is now retired, sign a false affidavit saying that Mr. Frankel had $1 billion in Vatican money in the charity that he created and controlled, the St. Francis of Assisi Foundation.</p>
        <p>In his interview with ABC, Mr. Frankel insisted that ''never in a million, never in a billion years,'' was this charity a cover for criminal activity. He said: ''The most hungry people we fed. Yes, we fed some of the most hungry people in the world.'' He declined, however, to specify how much money was in the charity, or how it operated.</p>
        <p>Last May, after failing to appease  state regulators, Mr. Frankel fled the country, leaving documents ablaze in his house. From the debris, police officers said they recovered a ''to do'' list, in which ''launder money'' was prominently listed.</p>
        <p>During the last eight months -- while he has struggled in jail with dental problems and tried, unsuccessfully to get kosher food, according to his lawyers -- his legal troubles have only deepened. At least three of his former associates have cooperated with federal prosecutors, providing information about Mr. Frankel's transactions.</p>
        <p>''I am not a financial genius,'' he said, laughing and shaking his head during the ABC interview. ''If a financial genius would end up in here, then they're not a genius by definition.''</p>
