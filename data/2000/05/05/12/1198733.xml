        <p>If you think children grow up too fast, pity the poor insect. Only 2 days old, Maya the Bee is told to toil in the hive. Since a bee's work is never done, Maya decides not to begin it at all. Instead, she flies off to pursue tastes more exotic than honey.</p>
        <p>This is the charming premise of ''The Adventures of Maya the Bee,'' a new family production from the Culture Project. Adapted from a long out-of-print children's book of the same title by the German author Waldemar Bonsels, ''Maya'' is remarkable in several respects, not least because it's a feminist tale first translated into English in 1922.</p>

        <p>If you think children grow up too fast, pity the poor insect. Only 2 days old, Maya the Bee is told to toil in the hive. Since a bee's work is never done, Maya decides not to begin it at all. Instead, she flies off to pursue tastes more exotic than honey.</p>
        <p>This is the charming premise of ''The Adventures of Maya the Bee,'' a new family production from the Culture Project. Adapted from a long out-of-print children's book of the same title by the German author Waldemar Bonsels, ''Maya'' is remarkable in several respects, not least because it's a feminist tale first translated into English in 1922.</p>
        <p>Maya's story is told through rod and shadow puppets, but this is no more a conventional puppet show than Julie Taymor's ''Lion King'' is. Designed by Zofia Czechlewska and built by the Teatr Baj of Poland and Eli Worden, the elaborate puppets range from Maya, who looks like a pugnacious preschooler who has sprouted wings, to Miss Loveydear, the Mae West of dragonflies. Ms. Czechlewska's mix of insect and human features is ingenious, and children are invited to admire her work and touch it after the show.</p>
        <p>In addition to dazzling puppets, there is an inventive score by Nancy Harrow, who also conceived the production, wrote the lyrics and sings several parts. Her specialty is jazz, and the result is a children's musical that sounds as if Cab Calloway and Billie Holliday had a hand (or at least a voice) in it. Assisted by the singers Daryl Sherman and Grady Tate, Ms. Harrow evokes insects that are also very cool cats. (One cavil: The longer numbers seem to interest parents more than preschoolers; 5 to 10 is the best age range.)</p>
        <p>The story, adapted by Rachel Klein, is whimsical but never sugarcoated. A few of Maya's friends are dispatched (it's a bug-eat-bug world), and Maya herself nearly winds up as a spider's dinner. But by the end she is a heroine to her hive.</p>
        <p>Directed by Will Pomerantz, ''Maya the Bee'' is enjoying an open-ended run. Long may she buzz.</p>
        <p>''The Adventures of Maya the Bee,'' Saturdays at 11 a.m. at the Salon Theater, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, Greenwich Village. Tickets: adults, $12; children, $6. Reservations: (212) 539-6644.</p>
        <p>Winged Victories</p>
        <p>This is the time when people begin to flock to their summer homes, clearing out dust and restocking supplies. But if those with houses on Long Island or in the Berkshires think that they have it hard, they might visit the Central Park Zoo this weekend and learn about more beleaguered travelers: birds.</p>
        <p>''You think of New York as such a tourist stop,'' said Randi Winter, a zoo educator. ''But the tourists aren't just people. Birds are tourists, too.''</p>
        <p>The zoo will salute them with its first Migration Sensation Weekend, planned around International Migratory Bird Day (tomorrow).</p>
        <p>For older children and adults there will be lectures and a two-hour birding tour tomorrow and Sunday at 9 a.m. It will begin in the zoo's rain forest building and end in Central Park, where those taking part will look for migratory species like Baltimore orioles and redtail hawks.</p>
        <p>For younger visitors, ''we have a series of activities that puts kids in the position of being the migratory birds,'' Ms. Winter said.</p>
        <p>In Feeding Frenzy, children will toss beanbags shaped like food into a huge bird's beak, storing calories for the journey north. They will also play Risky Business, a form of hopscotch in which they must avoid landing on squares that symbolize the perils migrating birds face.</p>
        <p>Finally, Nest for Success demonstrates parenthood from a bird's perspective. It's a relay race in which participants gather nourishment for the babies they raise after they arrive. It shows, Ms. Winter said, ''that to have a successful migration is more than just getting there.''</p>
        <p>Migration Sensation Weekend, tomorrow and Sunday from 10:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (only the bird tours start at 9 a.m.) at the Central Park Zoo, 64th Street and Fifth Avenue. Free with admission: $3.50; the elderly, $1.25; ages 3 to 12, 50 cents.</p>
        <p>What's in a Name?</p>
        <p>''Susannah and the Star Thing'' sounds as if it might be a science-fiction story, perhaps with a galactic version of the Swamp Thing. As it turns out, the play does have a monster, but it's one whose roots are more ancient: Rumpelstiltskin.</p>
        <p>Here he's taller, his nickname is Shade, and as campily played by Michael-John Pobuda, he resembles a cross between Richard Simmons and Dracula. (His look includes fiery red hair and a black coat.) But his nasty business is similar: he will make Susannah a film star, but only if she can give him her little sister to raise, or guess his full name.</p>
        <p>A musical commissioned by City Lights Youth Theater, ''Susannah'' features impressive talents besides the Brothers Grimm: Susan Birkenhead, who wrote the book and lyrics, was the lyricist for ''Jelly's Last Jam,'' and Matthew Sklar, the composer, has conducted and played piano for several Broadway shows.</p>
        <p>Susannah, played in the evenings by Patricia Capuano and at matinees by Christi Berlane, feels forced into her Faustian bargain by her dad (Rocco Buonpane), who insists that she's star material. The audience will enjoy seeing her triumph over Shade, whose real name I won't reveal, except to say that it surely reflects the city as a melting pot.</p>
        <p>''Susannah and the Star Thing,'' tonight at 7, tomorrow at 2 and 7 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. at the Blue Heron Arts Center, 123 East 24th Street, Manhattan. Tickets: adults, $7; students, teenagers and the elderly, $5; free for children 5 and under. Reservations: (212) 262-0200.</p>
