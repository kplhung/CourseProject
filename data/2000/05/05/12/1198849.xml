        <p>Merrill Lynch &amp; Company has joined the rush of Wall Street firms offering new benefits and risk-free investment opportunities to attract young investment bankers and prevent others from defecting to Internet companies.</p>
        <p>Merrill, one of the nation's biggest securities firms, is building a new fitness center for employees near its headquarters in Lower Manhattan and providing a concierge service to handle chores like shopping and laundry. The firm also hopes to lock in investment bankers by giving them chances to invest -- with a financial sweetener from the firm -- in new-economy companies that are still private.</p>

        <p>Merrill Lynch &amp; Company has joined the rush of Wall Street firms offering new benefits and risk-free investment opportunities to attract young investment bankers and prevent others from defecting to Internet companies.</p>
        <p>Merrill, one of the nation's biggest securities firms, is building a new fitness center for employees near its headquarters in Lower Manhattan and providing a concierge service to handle chores like shopping and laundry. The firm also hopes to lock in investment bankers by giving them chances to invest -- with a financial sweetener from the firm -- in new-economy companies that are still private.</p>
        <p>The moves, some of which Merrill announced internally yesterday, are the latest in a series of attempts by Wall Street firms to stem defections. The firms are still developing these benefits despite the recent weakness in technology stocks and rising doubts about the future of many Internet businesses.</p>
        <p>''I think the fever pitch has died down,'' said Mary Taylor, a senior vice president at Merrill. ''People are a little more even-keeled about it and not just saying, 'I have to go to a dot-com.' ''</p>
        <p>Still, Wall Street executives say the competition for people with strong analytical skills remains fierce. To compete, some firms are simply raising salaries. But most are trying to devise incentives that will have a minimal impact on their firms' quarterly income if the stock market remains shaky for a while.</p>
        <p>Merrill's midlevel to senior investment bankers will be able to invest as much as $1 million of their own money in a new private-equity fund with a focus on companies in technology, media and telecommunications.  For each dollar an employee invests, the firm will put in $2 of its own money and let the employee keep the return on the full amount.</p>
        <p>Younger bankers who are not qualified to -- or cannot afford to -- invest their own money in the fund will receive options worth as much as $100,000 on shares in the fund next month. Those options will give bankers in their first few years out of college or business school the chance to reap big gains without putting up any money. The catch is that they have to stay around to collect the gains when they are distributed.</p>
        <p>Ms. Taylor described those benefits as ''more cost-effective and efficient'' than increasing salaries or cash bonuses. She declined to say how Merrill would account for them but hinted that they were designed to have a limited impact on the firm's reported compensation expenses.</p>
        <p>Goldman Sachs Group, which recently handed out shares of its own stock to 8,000 junior employees, and Credit Suisse First Boston are drawing up similar plans.</p>
        <p>Some investment banks, including Lehman Brothers Holdings and Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, have offered senior bankers similar leveraged investment opportunities for years. Now, they and other firms are spreading the potential wealth more broadly to retain the young bankers who are most likely to be enticed by the prospect of quicker riches.</p>
        <p>Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette shook up the industry a few weeks ago when it offered hefty guaranteed pay for two years to young bankers who would sign agreements not to go to work for competitors. But other big firms have declined to follow suit.</p>
        <p>''Locking in base salaries and bonuses for two years, given the uncertainties of the market, is not the prudent thing to do,'' said Alicia Whitaker, a managing director at Credit Suisse First Boston. ''We continue to believe that a high percentage of variable compensation is what's appropriate.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Whitaker said her firm's recent increase of base salaries to $55,000 from $40,000 for first-year bankers, and to $65,000 from $45,000 for second-year bankers, showed that the firm was committed to paying some of the highest base salaries in the industry. Those raises, in turn, will drive up salaries through the rest of the investment bank, she said.</p>
        <p>The firm is also planning to offer private-equity investments to bankers all the way down to the lowest levels, Ms. Whitaker said, because the tug of war among investment banks and dot-com companies rages on. ''We'd love to think that it's over,'' she said, ''but our people are still getting calls.''</p>
