        <p>Tens of thousands of people stopped work today to mourn a former commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army who was gunned down at his home on Tuesday. His family and fellow commanders denounced the killing as an attack on Kosovo's stability and its very future.</p>
        <p>The former commander, Ekrem Rexha, who was known as Commander Drini, was given a military funeral, with uniformed soldiers laying wreaths and offering a gun salute at his grave. His hometown, Prizren, closed its businesses as thousands of people filed past his coffin in the biggest display of public solidarity seen since the end of Kosovo's war.</p>
        <p>''This is a pain for all of the city of Prizren, a pain that all of Kosovo feels,'' Gen. Agim Ceku, former commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army and now chief of its civilian successor, the Kosovo Protection Corps, said in a speech at the graveside. ''To kill a legendary commander on his doorstep, is not only a crime against a hero, but against all the people who have already sacrificed so much.''</p>
        <p>Commander Drini's death brings to 23 the number of Kosovo Liberation Army members killed since the end of the war in June. The deaths have come as a result of internal score-settling, business disagreements or, increasingly, political rivalry. The grass-roots guerrilla movement always had a varied following, but the shootouts between former comrades-in-arms has shocked many people in Kosovo.</p>
        <p>Several thousand people gathered on a hillside in Landovica, several miles outside Prizren, to bury Commander Drini among other former soldiers of the Kosovo Liberation Army. Red flags of Albania, bearing the black eagle, flew at half staff as former soldiers and villagers balanced on top of trucks to catch a glimpse of the proceedings.</p>
        <p>''The people who did this, did it against the K.L.A., against freedom and against the future of Kosovo,'' General Ceku said. Also present was a former commander turned politician, Ramush Haradinaj, who was a close friend of Commander Drini and had reportedly approached him to join his newly formed coalition of political parties. Clearly upset, Mr. Haradinaj declined to comment on the slaying, and drove away, alone but for his bodyguards.</p>
        <p>In a sign of its concern, the United Nations mission in Kosovo ordered some 30 police officers to investigate the case. But Commander Drini's family doubts that the killer or killers will be found.</p>
        <p>Without naming anyone in particular, General Ceku said opponents of a liberal, stable and prosperous Kosovo were behind the killing, and he implied that those who were against Kosovo Albanians' bid for independence were involved.</p>
        <p>''He had a vision of what should be done after the war,'' he said. ''In Kosovo there are still forces that are working against Kosovo's freedom. They could not stop the freedom for which Drini fought; now they are trying to stop the development.</p>
        <p>''The future of Kosovo cannot be built on murders and an absence of security. Nobody is going to allow this, because it is against the aspirations of our war, the ideal and the efforts Drini made.''</p>
        <p>Commander Drini's family was more direct. They had received threats recently, his brother, Nazim Rexha, said. He said he was sure that the killing was not personal or business-related, but a political attack on the moderate values of the former commander.</p>
        <p>Just back from seven years working in England, Mr. Rexha spoke more freely than his relatives. ''They were intimidated lately,'' he said of his family. ''I do not know by whom, but probably by people who do not want to see a democratic state being formed.''</p>
        <p>''Drini was only guilty of one thing, of being clever,'' he said. ''In Kosovo apparently we are only taught to be led and not to lead. It seems somebody minds someone who can lead.''</p>
        <p>Commander Drini's local standing and potential as a political leader may have been his downfall. At 38, he was a professional soldier and former officer of the Communist-era Yugoslav Army, and he taught at a military college in Sarajevo until 1993.</p>
        <p>He joined the Kosovo Liberation Army soon after the conflict began in Kosovo in 1998 and was rapidly made commander of the Pashtrik region, one of seven regional zones of the guerrilla group's war against the Serbian military and police forces. He was promoted to its general staff during the intense fighting of the three months of the NATO bombing campaign, and was known for his his leadership and organizational ability.</p>
        <p>''He and Ceku and a few others helped professionalize the general staff during a critical time,'' a Western diplomat who knew Commander Drini said. ''They brought a lot of stability to the general staff when the K.L.A. was close to falling apart in the first weeks when they were really being pounded. I think he provided some real leadership.''</p>
        <p>He spoke seven languages and was widely liked and respected by military and United Nations officials. After the end of the war in June, he left the guerrilla group, which later in the year signed an agreement to disband, and joined the local administration in Prizren as an environment and safety officer.</p>
        <p>He was killed at 8:15 a.m. on Tuesday as he left his home to go to work. As he bent to change a flat tire, a gunman shot him eight times in the body and once, at close range, in the head. As he fell to the street, dropping his keys, his wife, who is the mother of his 10-month old baby, and seven months pregnant with their second child, rushed from the house to his side, according to a witness.</p>
        <p>''They have killed my husband,'' she screamed to her neighbor, who recounted the moments to a reporter. ''She kept screaming 'Wake up, wake up, we have a son and another on the way.' ''</p>
        <p>Since the shooting, violence has flared in the area. An American peacekeeping soldier was wounded and required stitches after Serbs attacked military policemen investigating an explosion in the village of Vrbovac in southern Kosovo.</p>
        <p>A Swedish man, working for the Norwegian People's Aid group that clears land mines, was shot in the leg and shoulder in the early hours of the morning in the western town of Pec, Agence France-Presse reported. His wounds were not life-threatening, the agency said.</p>
