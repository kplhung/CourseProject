        <p>Officially, there were two winners in the record-breaking Big Game lottery that was drawn on Tuesday. But yesterday a third emerged: the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.</p>
        <p>The Port Authority reported that it had collected record tolls at its crossings into New York City as New Yorkers ventured into New Jersey by the thousands for a shot at what became the largest lottery jackpot in American history.</p>
        <p>Some 391,178 vehicles were counted crossing back into the city from New Jersey at the one-way toll plazas last Friday, when the jackpot was at $230 million in the Big Game, a lottery shared by New Jersey and six other states.</p>
        <p>That was 35,000 more than the average daily number of crossings at the authority's six bridges and tunnels. The numbers topped the previous record of 384,250 vehicle crossings, which was logged the previous Friday, April 28, when the jackpot had reached  $100 million.</p>
        <p>''We don't survey every car, but we think the lottery was the biggest reason based on our observations about the times people were traveling,'' said Steve Coleman, a spokesman for the Port Authority. ''And the nice summer day last Friday was the secondary reason, we think.''</p>
