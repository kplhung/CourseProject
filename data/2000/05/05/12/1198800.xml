        <p>THEY may call themselves retired, but baseball players like to think they could roll out of bed on Christmas Day and whack a curveball, or throw one.</p>
        <p>Now a few retired players are being cajoled by seductive whisperings of Olympic gold medals and one more road trip to beat all road trips.</p>
        <p>The voice belongs to Bob Watson, who was general manager of the Yankees when they won the so-called World Series in 1996. Watson has now moved on to truly global events, serving as co-chairman of the selection committee for the American baseball team at the Summer Games in Sydney, Australia, in September.</p>
        <p>He tosses out a few names like Tim Raines, Chili Davis, Jimmy Key, Terry Steinbach, Pat Kelly, Orestes Destrade, all currently retired.</p>
        <p>He needs a talent pool because the Olympics, which opened for the Jordans and Everts and Gretzkys in the past decade, are now open to baseball professionals. The South Koreans are closing down their pro league in September to send their very best, the Japanese leagues are sending a legitimate all-star team, and the Cubans are sending their state-supported amateurs who dominate world tournaments.</p>
        <p>''Our college guys cannot compete with them,'' Watson said, correctly.</p>
        <p>There is a major league cast to the manager, a chap named Lasorda, but Major League Baseball is not about to do what the National Hockey League did in 1998 and will do again in 2002: shut down for a few weeks and let its players represent their countries.</p>
        <p>Faced with this hard line, Dave Nilsson, the Australian catcher, left the Milwaukee Brewers to play in Japan this season, in order to represent his own country this September.</p>
        <p>Major League Baseball may grant a furlough to a few professionals buried down deep on some 40-man roster, but Watson is forced to seek talent that may currently be changing diapers, playing golf and clipping coupons. ''The big question is, you shut down mentally when you stop playing,'' said Watson, who retired in 1984, after 19 years. ''You go, 'Wheeeew.' You don't worry about doing it anymore.''</p>
        <p>However, Watson understands the skill and confidence that reside in retired players. He guaranteed that Manny Mota, the Dodgers' 62-year-old coach, could still hit, although he does not plan to recruit Mota, who is of Dominican ancestry, at any rate.</p>
        <p>Watson is going after more recent players, including Kelly, once a Yankee second baseman, who retired this spring after his shoulder did not recover from surgery.</p>
        <p>Kelly was already enthused about the Summer Games because his wife is from Adelaide, and they plan to raise their family in Australia. He recently did commentary for a television channel in Australia, covering the Intercontinental Cup, baseball's major amateur tournament, and while in Sydney, he sneaked into the Olympic Stadium to look around.</p>
        <p>''Unbelievable stadium,'' he said. ''The games are going to be so great.''</p>
        <p>Now he can dream about marching in the opening parade, and representing his own country in his wife's homeland. ''I'd help out in any capacity -- coach, scout, hit fly balls,'' he said. ''But if I can play, that would be great.''</p>
        <p>Watson is urging players to start looking for a semipro team in their area, so he can send around a scout to see if their legs and waistlines and arms are still acceptable. He will assemble a large squad by early July, and then announce a team of 24 regulars and six alternates by Aug. 23.</p>
        <p>He understands he is tinkering with the pride of major leaguers, but said: ''I can talk to them a whole lot easier than a college coach can. I coached in the World Series. I was general manager in the World Series. I can call somebody up and say, 'Hey, Rock.' '' He would love to use Raines, the highly popular 40-year-old who is coping with lupus and could not quite make it back with the Yankees this spring although he was in good physical shape. Watson also heard from Destrade, a Cuban-born slugger who had nine admirable seasons in Japan and finished up with Florida in 1994.</p>
        <p>Davis, a mature presence with the Yankees his final two years, has been enjoying not having people tell him what to do after 20 years of following orders. Of all people, Davis has the imagination to be intrigued, the way Watson is.</p>
        <p>As a player, Watson never imagined himself walking in the opening ceremonies, but now he says: ''All I want is on Sept. 27 to hear the national anthem playing for the gold-medal ceremony.''</p>
        <p>Watson sells the image of the parade to his major league colleagues. He counts on their inner voice, the one that says they can still play.</p>
