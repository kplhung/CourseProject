        <p>The Senate decisively approved legislation today to promote commerce with Africa and the Caribbean, ending more than five years of defeats on trade bills for the administration.</p>
        <p>The 77-to-19 vote reflected unusual bipartisan support for a compromise measure worked out by Senate and House negotiators that would lower tariffs and quotas on products from sub-Saharan Africa, the Caribbean and Central America. More than 20 African ambassadors watched approvingly from the gallery during the vote.</p>
        <p>The legislation now goes to President Clinton, who is expected to sign it quickly.</p>
        <p>Most of the measure's provisions will not take effect for several months, until trade officials can determine which countries and products are eligible for new privileges.</p>
        <p>Supporters cheered today's passage as an important first step to build broader commercial and diplomatic ties between the United States and some of the world's most impoverished nations. Opponents, largely from textile states in the South and New England, warned of crippling job losses for American workers.</p>
        <p>''We're doing something for Africa besides sending peace forces or aid,'' said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat and one of the bill's chief sponsors.</p>
        <p>The legislation would be the first major trade measure enacted in the United States since approval of the Uruguay Round in 1994, which set up the World Trade Organization.</p>
        <p>The measure is separate from an even more contentious China trade bill before Congress, but Mr. Clinton and other supporters of the China bill hope that approval of the Africa-Caribbean measure will build momentum for the larger legislation.</p>
        <p>The House is to vote on the China bill the week of May 22, but the outcome is considered too close to call.</p>
        <p>The Africa-Caribbean compromise drew broad bipartisan support today after months of backroom haggling and after last rites were read over the legislation more than once.</p>
        <p>Supporters said the measure would help African nations diversify their trade with the United States to include apparel and textiles, and translate into $8 billion in new sales and 120,000 jobs for the United States over the next five years. Oil, platinum, diamonds and gold make up about 80 percent of current African exports to United States.</p>
        <p>Last year, the House and Senate approved different versions of the measure. Since then negotiators have sought a compromise.</p>
        <p>Under today's deal, worked out with the help of the House speaker, J. Dennis Hastert, and the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, the House agreed to grant many of the same duty-free benefits to 24 Caribbean and Central American countries that 48 African nations will get.</p>
        <p>The House had not included the Caribbean in its legislation because of objections from lawmakers in textile states. But senators felt strongly about correcting an unintended consequence of the 1993 North American Free Trade Agreement, which diverted much American investment to Mexico from the Caribbean.</p>
        <p>In return, the Senate dropped its insistence that duty-free imports from Africa be made with fabric, yarn or thread from the United States.</p>
        <p>In a concession to textile-makers, the agreement initially caps the volume of duty-free goods at 1.5 percent of all textile imports. That cap rises to 3.5 percent over eight years.</p>
