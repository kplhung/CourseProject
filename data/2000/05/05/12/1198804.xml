        <p>More than 9 out of 10 physicians who were asked to diagnose symptoms typical of early alcohol abuse failed to recognize the problem in patients, a study by a leading substance-abuse center has found.</p>
        <p>Joseph A. Califano, the head of the organization, the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, said on Wednesday that such failure was a ''lost opportunity'' to reduce substance abuse and cut its costs to society.</p>
        <p>The center's survey of doctors nationwide found nearly 94 percent failed to include substance abuse among five possible diagnoses they were asked to make based on the following symptoms typical of the early stages of alcohol abuse for a 38-year-old married patient: recurrent abdominal pain, intermittent elevated blood pressure, gastritis, frequent wakefulness at night and irritability.</p>
        <p>Mr. Califano. a former secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, called on doctors to focus more closely on alcohol and drug abuse, urged medical schools to emphasize it in their teaching and suggested that state licensing boards stress the importance of the problem.</p>
