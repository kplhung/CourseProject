        <p>President Clinton said today that the United States would try to help the United Nations reinforce its peacekeeping troops in Sierra Leone and that he was sending the Rev. Jesse Jackson to the region to see if he could help negotiate a halt to the violence.</p>
        <p>''I have asked Reverend Jesse Jackson, my special envoy for democracy in Africa, to return to the region to work with leaders there for a peaceful resolution of this crisis,'' Mr. Clinton said in a statement.

        <p>President Clinton said today that the United States would try to help the United Nations reinforce its peacekeeping troops in Sierra Leone and that he was sending the Rev. Jesse Jackson to the region to see if he could help negotiate a halt to the violence.</p>
        <p>''I have asked Reverend Jesse Jackson, my special envoy for democracy in Africa, to return to the region to work with leaders there for a peaceful resolution of this crisis,'' Mr. Clinton said in a statement. ''Reverend Jackson has been actively involved in our diplomatic effort to help the people of Sierra Leone realize their peaceful aspirations.''</p>
        <p>The peacekeepers have taken up positions to defend the capital, Freetown, from rebel attack and apparently made some progress today, but fighting remains widespread.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton spoke today by telephone with Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, and ''continued to pledge that we would do whatever we could to support reinforcement of the mission in Sierra Leone,'' said P. J. Crowley, a White House spokesman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Crowley said the United States would remain involved politically, ''and we are willing to help militarily to help end this conflict.''</p>
        <p>In his statement, Mr. Clinton said, ''I have instructed our military to provide needed assistance to accelerate the deployment of troops'' to the region. Freetown has been girding for an assault by the rebels.</p>
        <p>The peacekeeping troops are lightly armed and did not expect combat. The immediate task, administration officials said, is to get properly equipped reinforcements to Freetown. The peacekeeping operation is essentially in West African hands.</p>
        <p>''A U.S. military team is now in Nigeria to determine what assistance might be needed from the international community to outfit and transport these forces as quickly as possible,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Crowley said the United States would help in getting some Jordanian troops into Sierra Leone in the next few days. He said other contingents, including Indians and Bangladeshis, would be arriving in the region within a couple of weeks.</p>
        <p>''The U.N. is serious about stabilizing the situation and bringing additional capabilities into Sierra Leone, to try to get Sierra Leone back towards the peace process,'' he said.</p>
