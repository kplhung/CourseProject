        <p>In a settlement that entailed as much public humiliation as punitive fines, the Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced that a Pennsylvania white supremacist must make a public apology to a woman he acknowledged harassing and must help promote anti-discrimination efforts.</p>
        <p>Under the unusual settlement of a civil suit, the defendant, Roy E.

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>In a settlement that entailed as much public humiliation as punitive fines, the Department of Housing and Urban Development today announced that a Pennsylvania white supremacist must make a public apology to a woman he acknowledged harassing and must help promote anti-discrimination efforts.</p>
        <p>Under the unusual settlement of a civil suit, the defendant, Roy E. Frankhouser, a self-described chaplain to the Ku Klux Klan, has agreed to issue a televised apology to his victim, Bonnie L. Jouhari, a former social worker who helped people file housing discrimination complaints in the Reading, Pa., area.</p>
        <p>And not on just any television program. To apply added force to the punishment, Mr. Frankhouser must read the apology aloud on ''White Forum,'' his public access show on the local cable system. He must also submit copies of his apology to Ms. Jouhari, who is white, to be published in the local newspaper and The Philadelphia Inquirer.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Frankhouser must broadcast public service announcements informing the public about laws against bias in housing.</p>
        <p>He must also display on the front of his house a poster supplied by HUD that opposes discrimination in the sale or rental of housing. And he must attend HUD-approved sensitivity sessions and perform 1,000 hours of community service.</p>
        <p>''We think this settlement makes a very loud statement, not just to this particular case, but to anyone who would think of engaging or involving themselves in this hideous type of behavior,'' the HUD secretary, Andrew M. Cuomo, said.</p>
        <p>The settlement ends a case that began in 1997, when Mr. Frankhouser is said to have begun his campaign of harassment against Ms. Jouhari and her daughter, Pilar Danielle Horton, who was in high school at the time. Ms. Jouhari filed a complaint with the local police department accusing Mr. Frankhouser of possession of automatic weapons.</p>
        <p>In response, Ms. Jouhari said, the burly Mr. Frankhouser began sitting on a public bench just outside her office and taking photographs of her through the front window. He also broadcast on his show images of Ms. Jouhari and a computer-generated video of an explosion destroying Ms. Jouhari's office.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jouhari said that she and her daughter began receiving threatening telephone calls and that she found a flier on her car reading, ''Race Traitor Beware.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jouhari said she first tried to persuade local and federal law authorities to pursue criminal charges against Mr. Frankhouser, who is a member of the United Klans of America and who, according to HUD officials, had been arrested at least 142 times. But local police and the Justice Department reportedly declined to file criminal charges, citing Mr. Frankhouser's First Amendment rights.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jouhari said in an interview that the harassment caused her to fear for her life and to flee with her daughter, first to a nearby town in Pennsylvania and later to Seattle.</p>
        <p>''I had to leave my job, my home, my career, take my child away from everything that she knew because they elected not to enforce the law,'' said Ms. Jouhari, who no longer lives in Seattle but would not identify her current residence.</p>
        <p>Because the Justice Department had not brought criminal charges in the case, HUD officials said, the housing agency decided to file a civil case against Mr. Frankhouser.</p>
        <p>A Justice Department spokeswoman, Kara Peterman, said the department was still pursuing a criminal inquiry. ''The burden in a criminal investigation is very high, and that's why we are still carefully reviewing the criminal aspects of the matter,'' Ms. Peterman said.</p>
        <p>The settlement announced today also required Mr. Frankhouser to refrain from mentioning Ms. Jouhari or her daughter -- except to apologize -- in any public forum for the rest of his life. He must also stay at least 100 feet away from Ms. Jouhari and her daughter for the rest of his life.</p>
        <p>For the next 10 years he must pay 5 percent of his salary to Ms. Jouhari and 5 percent to her daughter in any year that he earns at least $25,000.</p>
