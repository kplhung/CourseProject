        <p>'Lumps, Bumps,  Eggs and Specimens'</p>
        <p>Franklin Parrasch Gallery</p>
        <p>20 West 57th Street</p>
        <p>Through May 20</p>
        <p>In the postwar era ambitious artists had two alternatives for making art out of the crafty, precious medium of ceramics. They could, like the sculptors Peter Voulkos or Robert Arneson, make it bigger, rougher and more aggressive. Or, like Ken Price, they could embrace its seductive intimacy but give it an eccentric twist.</p>
        <p>This show presents eight pieces from the 1960's that combine exquisitely refined surfaces and primordial, sexually or scatologically suggestive forms. The wonderfully attractive and repulsive ''Specimen C.F.'' looks like a big slug, its glossy body the color and texture of a dill pickle, its raised head a dull mauve with dark grooves gouged into it. ''L. Violet'' is like a sandy-textured, metallic purple ostrich egg, with a shiny button nose emerging from a patch of scrofulous skin.</p>

        <p>In the postwar era ambitious artists had two alternatives for making art out of the crafty, precious medium of ceramics.

Or, like Ken Price, they could embrace its seductive intimacy but give it an eccentric twist.</p>
        <p>This show presents eight pieces from the 1960's that combine exquisitely refined surfaces and primordial, sexually or scatologically suggestive forms. The wonderfully attractive and repulsive ''Specimen C.F.'' looks like a big slug, its glossy body the color and texture of a dill pickle, its raised head a dull mauve with dark grooves gouged into it. ''L. Violet'' is like a sandy-textured, metallic purple ostrich egg, with a shiny button nose emerging from a patch of scrofulous skin.</p>
        <p>''S.L. Blue,'' with its lustrous blue accented by a small chipped spot glazed bright red, attaches sophisticated Modernist color to an amorphous lump that resembles a mountain molded by a small child. Most of these lovingly detailed works are displayed on sleek, oversize wooden bases that enhance their mysterious and comical oddity.</p>
        <p>In the show's earliest piece, ''Silver'' (1961), purple veins escape from a hole in the side of a smooth, silver, helmetlike form. As it would continue to do for some four decades in the work of this valuable, endlessly inventive artist, something dark and visceral disturbs the surface of Apollonian beauty.</p>
