        <p>After losing $123 million since 1990 in an unsuccessful effort to win the country's fiercest newspaper war, the owners of The Rocky Mountain News in Denver announced yesterday that they intended to combine their business operations with those of The Denver Post, effectively ceding victory to The Post's owner, William Dean Singleton.</p>
        <p>The agreement ending the war would leave the Denver area with two newspapers that would compete journalistically but split their profits equally. To gain its 50 percent share, the E. W. Scripps Company, the owner of The News, is paying $60 million to Mr. Singleton's MediaNews Group, the owner of The Post.</p>

        <p>After losing $123 million since 1990 in an unsuccessful effort to win the country's fiercest newspaper war, the owners of The Rocky Mountain News in Denver announced yesterday that they intended to combine their business operations with those of The Denver Post, effectively ceding victory to The Post's owner, William Dean Singleton.</p>
        <p>The agreement ending the war would leave the Denver area with two newspapers that would compete journalistically but split their profits equally. To gain its 50 percent share, the E. W. Scripps Company, the owner of The News, is paying $60 million to Mr. Singleton's MediaNews Group, the owner of The Post.</p>
        <p>The proposed joint operating agreement is subject to Justice Department approval, under the terms of a 30-year-old law that allows newspapers to skirt antitrust provisions to maintain two editorial voices in a community. If approved, the Denver arrangement would be the first new joint operating agreement in the country in 11 years.</p>
        <p>Kenneth W. Lowe, president and chief operating officer of Scripps, said at a news conference yesterday that the losses, averaging more than $12 million a year, were ''not a situation Scripps could sustain.'' Scripps is a public company with broad interests in newspapers, broadcast television stations and cable television channels like the Food Network. MediaNews is privately held.</p>
        <p>The two newspapers together employ more than 3,600 people, with 1,785 at The News and 1,870 at The Post. In a news release , Scripps said, ''It is currently anticipated that any need to eliminate positions will be done primarily through attrition.''</p>
        <p>The announcement, made after the close of the New York Stock Exchange, brought gloom to the newsroom of The News, an upscale tabloid. In recent years, the newspaper has expanded its business coverage and competed fiercely on breaking news like the killing of JonBenet Ramsey, last year's killings at Columbine High School and the sale of a local sports arena. ''People are upset,'' one reporter said.</p>
        <p>Each newspaper won a Pulitzer Prize for Columbine coverage last year. The Post won in the breaking news category, The News for breaking news photography.</p>
        <p>The aggressive editorial competition was matched, or exceeded, by an economic competition that led both newspapers to lower their subscription prices to as little as a penny, cutting circulation revenues by as much as two-thirds.</p>
        <p>The low prices, which began almost three years ago, helped pump up the two newspapers' circulations. The latest daily figures -- 446,465 for The News and 413,720 for The Post -- put both in the ranks of the country's top 25 daily newspapers.</p>
        <p>But The News could not translate its circulation gains, including a 25 percent increase in the most recent report from the Audit Bureau of Circulations, into profits, Mr. Lowe said yesterday. He said the paper had enjoyed only ''a modest increase in advertising.'' Scripps also, he said, has ''not been able to turn circulation gains into operating profits.''</p>
        <p>William R. Burleigh, Scripps' chief executive, was to travel today to Washington to give the Justice Department a statement declaring The News ''in probable danger of financial failure,'' Mr. Lowe said.</p>
        <p>Both The News and The Post would continue their current daily publication schedules. On Saturday, The News's editorial staff would produce a broadsheet newspaper under both nameplates. The Post's newsroom would produce the Sunday newspaper, the best-read newspaper of the week.</p>
