        <p>They speak to you about terribly private things. Your bank balance. Your e-mail. Who called. What they said. The movies you watch. As they get more sensitive, more attuned to your habits, they talk more and more, blabber a bit, actually, yakking for as long as you stay connected.</p>
        <p>They are, in fact, the voices of our lives. Most have a reputation for being detached, dehumanized cyborgs, mainly because they emanate from a telephone or a computer or some combination of the two.</p>

        <p>They speak to you about terribly private things. Your bank balance. Your e-mail. Who called. What they said. The movies you watch. As they get more sensitive, more attuned to your habits, they talk more and more, blabber a bit, actually, yakking for as long as you stay connected.</p>
        <p>They are, in fact, the voices of our lives. Most have a reputation for being detached, dehumanized cyborgs, mainly because they emanate from a telephone or a computer or some combination of the two.</p>
        <p>But the voices are not merely robotic chips. Real people exist, even thrive, behind the voices of services like Mr. Moviefone, Bell Atlantic's directory assistance, Citiphone banking, the American Online e-mail system and the Wildfire personal assistant, among others.</p>
        <p>Sure, the peoplebelonging to the voices may spend hours sitting before a microphone, only to have the software chop and dice their dulcet vowels until they sound like drones, but it did not start out that way.</p>
        <p>''People say to me all the time, 'I thought the computer did that,' '' said Susan Berkley, 45, the voice of Citiphone banking. ''It's like, duh, how did they get the voice into the computer?''</p>
        <p>It may lack the cachet of being a pretty face, but being a voice can be a life-altering experience. The Citiphone woman found a husband via her voice (or so her husband claims). The woman who is the voice of Wildfire gets such an avalanche of fan mail that she prefers to remain anonymous. In movie-conscious Los Angeles, Mr. Moviefone flashes the voice to extract choice tables from recalcitrant restaurants.</p>
        <p>''As far as making a living, it beats shoveling concrete,'' says Russ Leatherman, 36, the Moviefone voice. ''But it's the weirdest career path ever. Nobody goes to college and studies to be the voice of Mr. Moviefone.''</p>
        <p>Happenstance tends to play an enormous role in landing this kind of work. Eryca Dawson happened to bump into someone working for Bell Atlantic who suggested that she submit a tape. The voice of Wildfire comes from the former girlfriend of one of the company's engineers. The ''You've got mail'' guy on AOL is married to a former AOL consumer service representative, who overheard a conversation about the company needing a voice.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leatherman got his gig after helping to found the company in a Los Angeles garage in 1989. ''The guy I was working with had an absolutely terrible voice; he sounded a lot like Donald Duck,'' Mr. Leatherman said. ''So I gave it a shot and ended up being the voice.'' (His mother claims that it was fated by his genes, since she worked in the early 1950's as a time woman, hired by the phone company to read the time to callers.)</p>
        <p>The idea, Mr. Leatherman said, is not necessarily to be loved, but to be remembered. He is more than a little gleeful that he was chosen as one of those taxi voices, much detested by most New Yorkers, admonishing passengers to wear a seat belt.</p>
        <p>''People do despise it, which means it is the perfect venue for me,'' he said. ''But one of my most fun experiences was hearing the message and then talking like that. The driver said, 'You are the guy I have been listening to for the past two years!' ''</p>
        <p>Once a voice becomes as much a signature of the brand as the brand name itself is, companies tinker with them only reluctantly.</p>
        <p>Bell Atlantic started recording Ms. Dawson as the voice of all its announcements from Maine to Virginia so that people dialing directory assistance or myriad other services would identify the voice with the company. (James Earl Jones still opens for her with his ''Welcome to Bell Atlantic local and national 411.'')</p>
        <p>Every time the Moviefone guys decided that the voice was truly excessive and needed replacing, some TV sitcom like ''Seinfeld'' would build a plot around it, and company types came to view the voice like Lazarus. Mr. Leatherman said his contract specified that even if he was fired as president of the company, he still had to do the voice.</p>
        <p>Once established, some voices wrestle their way into being pop culture icons.</p>
        <p>Elwood ''Call me El'' H. Edwards, 50, owns the jaunty AOL voice that, in addition to heralding mail, says things like, ''You've got pictures'' or ''Goodbye.''</p>
        <p>The producers of ''The Simpsons'' television show cast him in an episode in which Homer and Bart were suffering from an apparent skin rash. Lisa plugged their symptoms into a Web site featuring a virtual doctor. And what did the cyberdoc, a k a the voice of Mr. Edwards, say?  ''You've got leprosy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Elwood, who lives in Orrville, Ohio, recorded his first mail announcement in 1989. His voice is now represented by the New York office of the William Morris talent agency.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the popularity of a voice can prove problematic. Wildfire is the name of a sophisticated voice mail system started in the 1990's that allows users, for up to $250 per month, to do lots of things, all through voice commands.</p>
        <p>The cyberwoman executing the commands remains on the line while the subscriber is on the phone. All the caller has to do is say ''Wildfire'' and she answers ''Here I am,'' and then responds to various commands. (Unless the subscriber happens to be in Italy or in France, in which case Wildfire responds ''Eccomi'' or ''Je suis la.'')</p>
        <p>Wildfire has a warm, slightly caustic voice, and she can be a little stern. If, for example, a man tells her to direct all calls to his cell phone and then does not answer, she will tell the caller, ''He is not where he said he would be.''</p>
        <p>Men worship her. They dispatch e-mail to the company seeking dates. She gets Christmas cards. Chat room participants never seem to tire of extolling her virtues. ''Some people are obsessed with her voice and they write repeatedly,'' said Erin Colliton, the marketing programs manager for Wildfire.</p>
        <p>The company traces the cult of Wildfire to Harry Newton, the editor of Computer Telephony magazine, who wrote about his infatuation with the voice in virtually every issue about five years ago.</p>
        <p>''He was the closest thing to a stalker we ever had,'' Ms. Colliton joked. But the intense interest prompted the company to maintain Wildfire's anonymity. ''She has her own life and her own full-time job and she doesn't want this interfering with it,'' Ms. Colliton said.</p>
        <p>The company will release a few details. She works in hospice care. Her voice was supposed to be only a prototype, but all the voices except hers were rejected by focus groups. (Male voices were especially rejected. Customers want their cyberassistants to be female.)</p>
        <p>The vocal attributes that land people in these jobs in the first place are, of course, no small part of their attraction for listeners. Many first learned how to exploit their voice appeal by working in radio. ''I try to inject some warmth, even though it can be pretty monotone,'' Ms. Dawson said. ''That comes across when I am smiling into the mike while I am speaking.''</p>
        <p>Magnetic voices are also apparently drawn to each other. ''My husband told me that as soon as he heard my voice on his voice mail he knew that I was the woman he was going to marry,'' said Ms. Berkley of Citiphone. ''He happens to have a great voice, too. I think that is part of the attraction between us -- we may wake up looking horrible, but we sure sound great.''</p>
        <p>Recording days can be long. The work requires sitting before the microphone for hours, saying strings of numbers. For services like directory assistance and the bank, each number has to be recorded three times with different inflections -- rising, neutral and dropping. The computer selects which of the three to use according to whether the number being given falls at the beginning, middle or end of the string of numbers. The work can also be lucrative. A contract for a big company like Bell Atlantic can easily bring $50,000 a year for a few days of work each month. Ms. Berkley charges $4 to $10 per recorded announcement, depending on the size of the job.</p>
        <p>Mr. Elwood will not say what he gets for his ''You've got mails,'' but does say he has no complaints. And Mr. Leatherman got rich. The four founders sold Moviefone for nearly $400 million in AOL stock last year, and he still gets a six-figure salary as president. He spends an average of six to seven hours a week recording.</p>
        <p>Discounting restaurant reservation clerks, the true popularity contest in which Mr. Leatherman shines tends to be around his elementary-school-age children. ''They think it is very cool to have Mr. Moviefone as their father,'' he said. ''All their friends know about it and ask me if I will say, 'Rated R.' ''</p>
        <p>Mostly he avoids using the Moviefone voice, though. ''I try to keep it out of the public because I fear scorn and ridicule,'' he said. His regular voice is not quite as deep as the recorded one, which also has more resonance and more emphasis on certain syllables. He does not view the voice as a talent, saying, ''It's not because it's great, it's because it's unique.''</p>
