        <p>Art of the 20th century dissolved boundaries, bringing a world of cross-disciplinary, multimedia, theatrical, electronic, cybernetic and other breakaway modes of expression. This world is instructively represented right now by the Whitney Biennial.</p>
        <p>A few blocks from the Whitney Museum, on the other hand, at the Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue at 67th Street, is what you might call the Anti-Biennial. To visit the International Fine Art Fair, on view through Wednesday, is to return to a world where traditional boundaries could hold up under terrific formal and imaginative pressure, where painting is unrivaled as a container for visual thought and feeling. Here art is concentrated rather than disintegrated, absorbing rather than distracting.</p>
        <p>Now in its seventh year, the fair convenes 65 dealers from Europe and the United States who collectively present a huge, dazzling display of paintings, drawings and sculpture dating from the Renaissance to the mid-20th century. It is a high-end enterprise. Prices range from $1,000 for a drawing to $4 million for certain paintings. In general the quality is museum level; all works have been vetted by a committee of experts to ensure authenticity. Sculpture is in relatively short supply, but if you like painting, you will love this show.</p>
        <p>The main attraction this year is Richard L. Feigen's booth, where part of a collection of 60 paintings owned by the financier Saul Steinberg is for sale. This extraordinary group includes a large picture by Titian of a chubby, blond Salome holding the head of John the Baptist in a dish. Made late in the artist's career (1560-70), it has the kind of deftly worked painterly qualities that modern artists would later appreciate. By contrast, next to it is a work of glassy transparency by the Flemish follower of Caravaggio Dirck van Baburen, a complicated, brightly colored picture of soldiers playing backgammon.</p>
        <p>While at Feigen, you can look also for a funny ''Bacchanale'' by Lucas Cranach with nine capering cherubs, two naked women and a fat god of drunkeness all crowded around a big wine tub; a genre scene of three musicians in a dingy room painted with Vermeerish refinement by Gerard Ter Boch; and an awesome landscape with Jesus in the distance preaching to a mob of tiny figures painted with miraculous delicacy by Jan Brueghel the Elder on a 10-by-14-inch plate of copper.</p>
        <p>Among Modernist presentations, Daniel Malingue's stands out. It includes a characteristically sweet, semi-abstracted portrait of a man by Modigliani; an unusually robust Cubist still life from 1929 by Braque; a wild late Picasso picture of a flute player and a naked, fractured woman in a goofy hat; and most intriguingly a large painting of a female nude with two men looking in from flanking windows, painted by Jean Helion in 1949 in his late, bright, cartoonlike manner.</p>
        <p>To single out one or another booth, however, is to overlook the real beauty of an event like this, which is the experience of wandering from space to space, discovering here and there amazing unexpected treasures. (While you are at it, you need not be afraid to talk to the dealers; they have an abundance of information and insights that they are only too happy to share.)</p>
        <p>There are paintings by Edouard Vuillard, for example, scattered throughout the show. One of the most striking is at Neffe-Degandt: an almost frighteningly stark, Goya-like picture of the artist's sister at an open window.</p>
        <p>If, on the other hand, you have a taste for French academic painting, at Richard Green there is a big, sexy picture by William Adolphe Bouguereau of a beautiful, mostly undraped woman getting dressed after a swim in a nearby stream. Or if English Fairy Painting is your cup of tea, you will enjoy a fine example of that curious genre at Maas in a small picture in a twiggy frame by John Austen Fitzgerald. Painted with miniaturistic delicacy, it depicts some little female fairies sheltered within a bird's nest while comical, Boschian demons cavort about in the surrounding vegetation.</p>
        <p>At Dover Street, along with a set of figure drawings by Egon Schiele and Picasso drawings from several different periods, including an exquisite neoclassical nude from 1920, there is one of the best works by the German satirist George Grosz you will ever see: a Cubist-style watercolor of a self-satisfied burgher in a top hat having a beer at a cafe table.</p>
        <p>Other items not to miss: a gorgeously colored, early 16th-century Adoration of the Magi by Giovanni Agostino Da Lodi at Agnew's; a juicy portrait of a youth in a blue suit by Chaim Soutine at Schmit; a very early (circa 1935) abstracted green interior by Francis Bacon at Crane Kalman; a lovely small, portrait of Madame Claude Monet by Renoir at Beadleston; a luminous, near postcard-size, watercolor view of Jerusalem by J. M. W. Turner at Salomon Lilian; and a richly painterly picture of a tiger-striped cat on a rumpled yellow bed by one of the few woman in the show, Suzanne Valadon, at Frost &amp; Reed.</p>
        <p>As for sculpture, you could do worse than to visit Patricia Wengraf, where among a hyperactive collection of bronzes, marbles and terra cottas, there are two fascinating polychromed wood works: a folklike full figure standing Christ Child with movable arms from the mid-1500's and an early 18th-century female saint's head, both carved and painted to touchingly human effect.</p>
        <p>Spend a few hours or even a few days at this exhibition; it will do wonders for your imagination.</p>
        <p>The International Fine Art Fair remains on view at the Seventh Regiment Armory, Park Avenue at 67th Street, through Wednesday. Hours: Today, tomorrow, Monday and Tuesday: 11 a.m. to 8 p.m.; Sunday and Wednesday: 11 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission: $15. Information: (212) 642-8572.</p>
