        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In reading your May 11 news articles about Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's personal life and how the Republicans are scurrying for a new Senate candidate ''fast,'' I am profoundly saddened. I grew up in New York. Has anyone in New York really seen what Mr. Giuliani has done for the city? I can tell you this: the people who visit there have. I can't believe that the Republicans would desert a man who has achieved what no other mayor has even tried in recent memory.</p>

        <p>In reading your May 11 news articles about Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's personal life and how the Republicans are scurrying for a new Senate candidate ''fast,'' I am profoundly saddened. I grew up in New York. Has anyone in New York really seen what Mr. Giuliani has done for the city? I can tell you this: the people who visit there have. I can't believe that the Republicans would desert a man who has achieved what no other mayor has even tried in recent memory.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani cleaned up the streets, made a night life possible in areas in which it had dried up, and brought business and respect back to the city. He has taken the heat for many things outside of his control, and he has taken his responsibility seriously.</p>
        <p>If the Republicans desert this man, I will never consider voting for a Republican again because it means the party has completely lost its integrity.</p>
