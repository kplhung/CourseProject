        <p>City Council members yesterday criticized a 30 percent increase in the Police Department's overtime budget this year and chastised department officials for failing to anticipate the cost of events and a new program.</p>
        <p>As recently as two months ago, the department had told the Council that it would need another $63 million for the fiscal year ending June 30 to cover overtime for unanticipated events, including a ticker-tape parade for the New York Yankees and the Operation Condor anti-crime initiative. That increase swelled the projected overtime budget to $177 million, a 5 percent increase over the $168 million spent last year.</p>

        <p>City Council members yesterday criticized a 30 percent increase in the Police Department's overtime budget this year and chastised department officials for failing to anticipate the cost of events and a new program.</p>
        <p>As recently as two months ago, the department had told the Council that it would need another $63 million for the fiscal year ending June 30 to cover overtime for unanticipated events, including a ticker-tape parade for the New York Yankees and the Operation Condor anti-crime initiative. That increase swelled the projected overtime budget to $177 million, a 5 percent increase over the $168 million spent last year.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, however, police officials told the legislators that it would  need $43 million more, increasing the projected budget to $220 million. The increase was attributed to expansion of the Condor program and many unanticipated events, like demonstrations following the acquittal in February of four police officers who shot Amadou Diallo.</p>
        <p>Several Council members said they were upset by the rapid surge in spending. ''If my household budget were like that I would be bankrupt, or in jail,'' said Councilman Philip Reed, a Democrat from Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Police officials, noting overtime still represents only 5 percent of the total police budget, said patrols financed with the overtime contributed greatly to the 7 percent drop in crime this year. And they said that a good portion of the overtime was impossible to forecast because it could not be predicted when demonstrations would occur or when baseball teams would win pennants.</p>
        <p>Officials attributed much of the overtime increase to their expansion of Operation Condor, which began as an anti-drug program and was broadened several months ago into a program that is financing a crackdown on qualify-of-life offenses and addressing the rash of killings of livery cab drivers.</p>
        <p>The budget for Operation Condor, in which all of the officers work overtime to increase patrol strength, has risen from $24 million to $39 million, officials said.</p>
        <p>The second large piece of the new $43 million in overtime spending is needed to cover the cost of unplanned events, like the demonstrations over the Diallo verdict, which cost $3 million, officials said. Police budget analysts said the cost of paying officers overtime to work these events had risen from $34.8 million last year to a projected $55.3 million this year.</p>
        <p>Several Council members said that however well-intended the expenditures, it was wrong for the department to ask permission to spend large sums that had already been spent. ''We have to give it you because it is already a done deal,'' said Councilwoman Juanita E. Watkins, a Democrat from Queens.</p>
