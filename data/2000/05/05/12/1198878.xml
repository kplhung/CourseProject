        <p>The hard truth of fire management is that the conditions most auspicious for a ''prescribed burn,'' in which dangerously dense pine forests are purged of combustible debris, are not so very different from those that can lead to a devastating wildfire. The weather must be dry enough for brush, dead wood and thickets of stunted pine trees to ignite, and there must be enough wind to spread the flames.</p>
        <p>''It's never completely safe,'' said Dr. Wallace Covington, a professor at Northern Arizona University's School of Forestry in Flagstaff. ''You offer up a little prayer and hope for the best, because the situation might get out of control.''</p>

        <p>The hard truth of fire management is that the conditions most auspicious for a ''prescribed burn,'' in which dangerously dense pine forests are purged of combustible debris, are not so very different from those that can lead to a devastating wildfire. The weather must be dry enough for brush, dead wood and thickets of stunted pine trees to ignite, and there must be enough wind to spread the flames.</p>
        <p>''It's never completely safe,'' said Dr. Wallace Covington, a professor at Northern Arizona University's School of Forestry in Flagstaff. ''You offer up a little prayer and hope for the best, because the situation might get out of control.''</p>
        <p>If the fires are set in the spring, when conditions in the Southwest are hot and dry, there is a danger of losing control of the flames. But if the fires are set in the fall, when it is cooler and wetter, temperature inversions may trap the smoke, choking nearby residents.</p>
        <p>''It's the devil and the deep blue sea,'' Dr. Covington said. ''More people die of emphysema and heart disease from smoke than are ever killed from wildfires.''</p>
        <p>In the worst possible case, like the one that set off the fire around Los Alamos, N.M., the wind and heat become too intense. The flames leap into the forest canopy causing a raging ''crown fire'' that jumps from tree to tree. Tall dry pines, loaded with sap, explode from the heat.</p>
        <p>To decide whether a planned fire ''meets the prescription,'' meaning that it is likely to remain under control, foresters plug a list of factors into a computer model: the amount of wood and other tinder in the forest, the moisture content of the fuels, the relative humidity and temperature of the air, the speed of the wind. They also refer to an esoteric gauge called the Haines index. This factor takes into account the humidity on the ground and how fast the temperature of the air cools as it is measured higher and higher above the terrain.</p>
        <p>''It's a very difficult science,' said Dave Simon, Southwestern director of the National Park Conservation Association, a nonprofit group that monitors national parks and monuments. ''There should be more prescribed fires going on in the national parks and forests,'' he said. ''It's absolutely essential that we inject fire back into these ecosystems.''</p>
