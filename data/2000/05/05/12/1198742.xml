        <p>''The Countess,'' which originally played at the Greenwich Street Theater, opened last night at the Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan. Following are excerpts from Anita Gates's review, which appeared in The New York Times on March 30, 1999.</p>
        <p>Husbands don't come much more critical than John Ruskin. ''You're not what I think a woman should be,'' he tells Effie, his wife of five years. She is ''insolent and willful,'' he says, and just to be sure there's no confusion, he adds, ''I don't like the way you look, sound or move.'' And his parents don't care for her, either.</p>
        <p>So it's clear throughout Gregory Murphy's serious but wonderfully witty period drama, ''The Countess,'' that this is not a happy marriage. No wonder Ruskin (James Riordan), the 19th-century art critic and essayist, invites a friend to join him and Effie (Jennifer Woodward) on their four-month holiday in Scotland. The guest is John Everett Millais (Jy Murphy), the pre-Raphaelite painter, who is Ruskin's protege.</p>
        <p>Millais, 10 years younger than Ruskin, is a little petulant (he calls their holiday cottage a ''chicken coop''), but he wants to paint Effie's ''odd beauty'' (can't this woman get a straightforward compliment from anybody?), and he soon finds himself attracted to her. The feeling is mutual, and when Effie grants his request to hear her speak his Christian name just once, they know. Her utterance of the word ''Everett'' is erotically charged. (The kiss in the second act, however, is even more so.)</p>
        <p>Millais's beliefs about women and art are very different from those of his mentor, which gives the author a chance to comment on perceptions of women's behavior, then and now. ''To idealize,'' Millais says, ''is to destroy, smother.'' ''All bachelors marry goddesses,'' Ruskin observes, ''but husbands live only with women.'' When Ruskin says he would rather be married to the beautiful 12-year-old that Effie once was, Millais compares that idea to ''looking to an acorn for shade.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Woodward manages to convey both a convincing Victorian demeanor and a lively, intelligent spirit longing to be set free. Mr. Murphy (no relation to the playwright) becomes that rare creature, a sexy Victorian sensitive guy.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Riordan is appropriately unlikable, a brilliant man completely oblivious to his own grave shortcomings.</p>
        <p>Most important, with all that terrific civilized hatred in the air, ''The Countess,'' splendidly directed by Ludovica Villar-Hauser, is tremendous fun.</p>
