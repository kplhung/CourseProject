        <p>The Supreme Court today overturned a decision to parole a Jewish settler who had initially been sentenced to life imprisonment for the execution-style killing of a Palestinian.</p>
        <p>The settler, Yoram Skolnik, 31, was granted parole in March on the ground that he did not pose a danger to the public. His sentence had been twice commuted, first to 15 years by President Ezer Weizman, then to 11 years by a former justice minister, Tzahi Hanegbi.</p>

        <p>The Supreme Court today overturned a decision to parole a Jewish settler who had initially been sentenced to life imprisonment for the execution-style killing of a Palestinian.</p>
        <p>The settler, Yoram Skolnik, 31, was granted parole in March on the ground that he did not pose a danger to the public. His sentence had been twice commuted, first to 15 years by President Ezer Weizman, then to 11 years by a former justice minister, Tzahi Hanegbi.</p>
        <p>Mr. Skolnik was to have been freed last month, but his release was held up by a petition to the Supreme Court by Zehava Galon, a legislator from the leftist Meretz Party.</p>
        <p>Ruling on the petition today, a seven-judge panel headed by the chief justice, Aharon Barak, said the parole board had acted unreasonably by failing to give appropriate weight to the danger posed by Mr. Skolnik, who the judges said had acted out of ''profound hatred'' stemming from a dangerous ''nationalistic ideology.''</p>
        <p>The judges ruled that Mr. Skolnik should serve out the remaining four years of his term.</p>
        <p>On March 23, 1993, Mr. Skolnik killed Musah Abu Sabha, a Palestinian who had been caught near Susia, a settlement south of Hebron in the West Bank, carrying a knife and a hand grenade. Mr. Abu Sabha was subdued after trying to stab a settler, and as he lay face down with his hands bound behind him, Mr. Skolnik shot him nine times with an Uzi submachine gun.</p>
        <p>Ms. Galon, the petitioner, said after today's ruling: ''The Supreme Court is essentially saying that a murderer cannot go free after seven years. The price for murdering an Arab is not seven years.''</p>
