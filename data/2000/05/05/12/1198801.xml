        <p>Speaker J. Dennis Hastert and the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott, agreed today to create a national security advisory panel of senior Republican experts in an effort to give more credibility to Congressional scrutiny and criticism of President Clinton's foreign policy.</p>
        <p>The creation of the panel, which is to be announced next week, coincides with growing alarm and distrust among many Republicans on Capitol Hill over crucial decisions Mr. Clinton will make in the coming weeks on missile defenses, nuclear arms reductions with Russia and other national security issues.</p>
        <p>''There's a growing concern that we need to really monitor events on how our national security is safeguarded,'' said Mr. Lott's spokesman, John Czwartacki.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lott and Mr. Hastert, who met privately today on a number of issues, are forming the panel with the knowledge and implicit blessing of top aides to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Indeed, the panel is likely to be stocked in part with experts who are advising Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Congressional aides said the panel of perhaps two dozen members would include former secretaries of defense and state, and other experts.</p>
        <p>Among those mentioned as leading candidates are Donald H. Rumsfeld, a former secretary of defense, and R. James Woolsey, a former director of central intelligence.</p>
        <p>The advisers would meet periodically to advise Mr. Lott and Mr. Hastert on national security issues. Their first task is likely to be counseling Republican leaders on Mr. Clinton's coming meeting in Moscow with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.</p>
        <p>''We have a very qualified pool of experts who hold positions of expertise that fall outside current government channels,'' Mr. Czwartacki said.</p>
        <p>''The idea is to establish a brain trust that can encompass all this talent and inform the opinions and decisions made by the leaders.''</p>
        <p>One senior House Republican aide said the group would be asked to submit reports on various issues to the Republican leadership with a final, wide-ranging report due in July, possibly for use by the speaker and majority leader on the campaign trail over the summer recess in August.</p>
        <p>The House and Senate already have committees intended to provide Mr. Lott and Mr. Hastert with the kind of advice and guidance they now seemingly feel they need from a distinguished group of outside experts.</p>
        <p>''There was a sense we needed to have people involved with the arms control issues to really provide counsel on a lot of important decisions,'' said a top House Republican aide.</p>
        <p>One vocal critic of the administration, Representative Curt Weldon, a Pennsylvania Republican, is thinking along the same lines as the two Republican leaders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weldon said he would introduce a bill next week calling for the creation of a bipartisan national security advisory panel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weldon said it would be modeled on a commission headed by Mr. Rumsfeld that two years ago conducted an assessment of the ballistic-missile threat to the United States.</p>
