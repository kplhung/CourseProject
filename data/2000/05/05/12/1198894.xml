        <p>The director of China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange director  fell to his death from the seventh floor of a Beijing hospital on Wednesday, local media and Chinese Internet sites reported today.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman from the foreign exchange agency declined to comment on the report.</p>
        <p>The news of Mr. Li's death first emerged from the sina.com Web site on Thursday, according to Frank Lu, who heads the Hong Kong-based Information Center for Human Rights and Democracy.</p>
        <p>Hong Kong dailies, which said variously that Mr. Li had been hospitalized for depression and diabetes, reported that he had been invited by the state disciplinary committee to aid in an investigation of the agency's former head, Zhu Xiaohua.</p>
