Reservations: (212) 201-1490 (Anthony Tommasini).</p>
        <p>LA GRAN SCENA OPERA. This all-male troupe has raised the skewering of the opera world's pretensions to the level of high, or at least tipsy, art. As usual, the company's founder and artistic director, Ira Siff, takes center stage as Madame Vera Galupe-Borszkh, this time in ''Murder Most Melodious.'' If you haven't seen the company before, be prepared for an evening of outrageous hilarity; if you have, be prepared for perhaps a touch too much repetitiousness and predictability. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 7 p.m., Town Hall, 123 West 43rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 307-4100. Tickets: $25 to $100  (James R. Oestreich).</p>
        <p>Classical</p>
        <p>ABSOLUTE ENSEMBLE. Kristjan Jarvi conducts his group in a program of Erkki-Sven Tuur's ensemble pieces under the collective title ''Architectonics.'' Mr. Tuur's music has something of the calm and simplicity associated with his fellow-countryman Arvo Part, but he has been influenced too by the glistening rush of American minimalism. Today at 8 p.m., discussion at 7 p.m., Miller Theater,  Broadway at 116th Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 854-7799. Tickets: $15 (Paul Griffiths).</p>
        <p>BACHMANN-KLIBONOFF-FRIDMAN. This fine young piano trio has been offering a series of thematic programs that explore a great expanse of the repertory, organized primarily by national styles. The closing program steps away from musical nationalism and looks at the tango, the Argentine dance  that flourished during the 20th century as the waltz did in the 19th. Included are works by Albeniz, Ravel and Piazzolla. Tonight at 7 (with a preconcert talk at 6:30), Morgan Library, 29 East 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 685-0008, extension 347. Tickets: $30, $20 for library members (Allan Kozinn).</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC. There are few better places in the city to hear chamber music than on this barge floating on the East River, with its live, intimate acoustics and its spectacular view of lower Manhattan. Good weather will only enhance the experience, and the performances are often as fine as the setting. Tonight, the McDermott sisters (Kerry, violinist; Maureen, cellist; and Anne-Marie, pianist) join the violist Paul Neubauer in a varied program, ranging from Mendelssohn to Piazzolla. And tomorrow and on Sunday, Joseph Silverstein, violinist; Fred Sherry, cellist; and William Wolfram, pianist, play works of Beethoven, Clara Schumann and Brahms. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, and Sunday at 4 p.m., Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-4061. Tickets: $23; $20 for the elderly; $15 for students (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>BOLCOM AND MORRIS. The composer and pianist William Bolcom and the mezzo-soprano Joan Morris, who are married to each other, have long made a specialty of American popular song. In a program called ''A Very Dry Martini,'' they offer works by Rodgers and Hart, Rodgers and Hammerstein, Cole Porter, Kurt Weill, Eubie Blake and Lerner and Lowe. Tonight at 8, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue at 82nd Street. Tickets, $30. The concert is sold out, but returns may be available beginning at 7; standing room tickets, at $15, may be available at the door; (212) 570-3949 (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>THE DESSOFF CHOIRS. The Dessoff Choirs, 75 years old this season and now directed by Kent Trittle, celebrates with a program including Gian Carlo Menotti's ''madrigal fable'' called ''The Unicorn, the Gorgon and the Manticore'' together with Marshall Coid's new ''Whitman Cantata (Of Love, Death, Nature and the Soul).'' Terrance Barber is the countertenor for Mr. Coid's piece. Tomorrow night at 8 at Alice Tully Hall. Tickets are $25, $20 for students and the elderly; (212) 721-6500 (Bernard Holland).</p>
        <p>ENSEMBLE FOR EARLY MUSIC. This enterprising ensemble of period instrument players and singers is offering Laudate Matrem -- ''In Praise of Motherhood'' -- a program in honor of Mother's Day. Included are selections from the Cantigas de Santa Maria, motets by Thomas Morely and Francisco Guerrero, as well as Italian laude and canzonets. The group's performers include Mark Rimple, Wayne Hankin, Todd Frizzell, Dan Rigazzi, Mark Sullivan and Jon Szabo. Tonight at 8 and tomorrow at 3, Cathedral of St. John the Divine, 1047 Amsterdam Avenue at 112th Street, (212) 280-0330. Tickets: $35 and  $60 (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>VLADIMIR FELTSMAN. The enormous  amount of publicity that the pianist Vladimir Feltsman attracted as an emigre from the Soviet Union in the 1980's made him a celebrity. In the long run it did not help his reputation as a pianist, though, for when the reality of his work failed to match the enormous build-up, critics were unusually blunt in their assessments. He has been working solidly over the years as a conductor and teacher as well as a pianist, and winning many admirers. His program this weekend at the 92nd Street Y should reveal much about the current state of his artistry. The program includes works by Haydn and Chopin and Brahms's demanding ''Handel Variations.'' 92nd Street Y (corner of Lexington Avenue and East 92nd Street), Tomorrow at 8 p.m. Tickets: $30; $15 for students and the elderly one hour before the show; (212) 996-1100 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>MATTHIAS GOERNE. Here, from a young German singer, is one of the loveliest baritone voices you will ever hear, but the precise uses to which it is put are not always as easy to certify. In Schubert's ''Winterreise'' a year ago at Carnegie Hall, Mr. Goerne proved intrusively finicky, manipulating every splendid syllable, tone and color. Here, with greater naturalness, one hopes, in a hall perhaps better suited to the size of his voice and to the repertory, he presents more songs by Schubert, interspersed with a like amount by Hanns Eisler. Eric Schneider is the pianist. Sunday at 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $38 (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>DINA KUZNETSOVA. The Marilyn Horne Foundation does important work supporting young vocal artists in their desire to give song recitals. The foundation has a good track record in uncovering promising singers. On Sunday afternoon at the Kosciuszko Foundation, Dina Kuznetsova, a Moscow-born soprano who sang the title role in Handel's ''Rodelinda'' in a production last summer by the Music Academy of the West in Santa Barbara, Calif., will present a recital program with the pianist Thomas Bagwell. Her program includes works by Rossini, Wolf, Barber, Szymanowsky, Rachmaninoff and Tchaikovsky.  The Kosciuszko Foundation, 15 East 65th Street. Sunday at 3 p.m. Tickets: $15; the performance is sold out but returns may be available; (212) 734-2130 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>MANHATTAN VIRTUOSI. This program, offered as a tribute to the Ukrainian conductor Natan Rakhlin, who died in 1979, complements the familiar, by Berlioz, Tchaikovsky and Saint-Saens, with the truly unusual. Here, in arrangements by the orchestra's conductor, Arkady Leytush, are a symphony by Mussorgsky, reconstructed and orchestrated from two piano sketches; Bach's C minor Organ Prelude (BWV 546); and Hampson Sisler's ''Cosmic Divide.'' Sunday at 3 p.m., Great Hall, Cooper Union, Third Avenue at Seventh Street, (212) 866-2958. Tickets: $15; $10 for students and the elderly (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC. Sir Colin Davis has always been an elegant Mozartean, and Alfred Brendel's Mozart usually captures both the depth and playfulness in the music. They are collaborating on the Piano Concerto No. 22 in an all-Mozart program that also includes the Symphonies Nos. 28 and 38. Tonight and tomorrow at 8. Avery Fisher Hall (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $26 to $92; the performances are sold out, but returns may be available (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>ORION STRING QUARTET. In six programs sponsored by the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center under the title Beethoven 2000, this talented group presents its first complete survey of the Beethoven quartets. The series is meant to honor charitable organizations that in various ways make music available to children, with a different organization recognized at each concert. The Orion players offer Beethoven's Opuses 18, No. 3; 59, No. 1; and 135 tonight and Opuses 18, No. 1; 59, No. 2; and 133 on Sunday. Tonight and Sunday at 8 p.m., Alice Tully Hall, (212) 875-5788. Admission is free, but tickets are required. All tickets have been distributed, but any returned tickets will be available five minutes before the performances. (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>ORPHEUS CHAMBER ENSEMBLE. Yaddo, the bucolic community for visual artists, writers and composers in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., was founded 100 ago. To celebrate, a festival of concerts, readings, exhibits and films is being presented in New York and in the region of the community for the next three months. The third of three programs presented by the esteemed Orpheus Chamber ensemble at the Society for Ethical Culture offers works written by composers who have resided at Yaddo. Several of these were actually written there. Tomorrow's program at the Society for Ethical Culture includes works by Bernstein, Ned Rorem, Sebastian Currier, Barbara Kolb, Michael Torke and a premiere by Steven Burke. Society for Ethical Culture, Central Park West at 64th Street. Tomorrow at 8 p.m. Tickets: $15. Information: (212) 592-4156 (Tommasini).</p>
        <p>SAINT FRANCOIS D'ASSISE. Musical glory. Three scenes from Messiaen's magnificent opera are being presented by a splendid cast led by David Wilson-Johnson as St. Francis and Heidi Grant Murphy as the Angel, with the wonderful Robert Spano conducting the Brooklyn Philharmonic and the Westchester Oratorio Society: nearly 300 people will be onstage producing a feast of brilliant orchestral colors, bird songs, magical chant melodies and the music of heaven. A rare opportunity, not to be missed. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100. Tickets: $8 to $40 (Griffiths).</p>
        <p>DAWN UPSHAW. This thoughtful soprano seems to like presenting expansive series rather than single recitals. In the first installment of her three-part ''Images of Dawn,'' she looked at French music. The second installment, tomorrow, is a collaboration with the Kronos Quartet that looks at contemporary works with links to traditional and folk styles. Among the composers whose works are included are Osvaldo Golijov, Rahul Dev Burman, Aleksandra Vrebalov, Anibal Troilo, Enrique Rangel, Gabriela Ortiz and Al-Shayk Abul-ila Muhammad. Tomorrow at 8 p.m., the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola, 980 Park Avenue, at 84th Street, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $38. (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>VOICES OF ASCENSION. Dennis Keene and this noted chorus of professionals have already contributed strongly to the commemorations of the 250th anniversary of Bach's death this year with an excellent performance of the B minor Mass at Alice Tully Hall. Here is another Bach program, this one combining four of the motets with solo vocal, chamber and organ works. Expect only the best from these performers.
