        <p>If fame is a reputation earned by achievement, and celebrity is just the fame of being famous, as Daniel Boorstin once suggested, what do you call achievement without much fame or any celebrity? The answer for today: Nathan Lyons. A photographer, Mr. Lyons has had a major impact on his field for close to four decades, yet very few people other than photographers and photography experts know his name, and not even many experts are familiar with much of his work.</p>
        <p>Part of the reason might be diffidence, selflessness, possibly even preference. Mr. Lyons's outstanding contribution has been in education, where he has broadened approaches to photography, and he has also been a force for change in his roles as curator, editor and writer.</p>

        <p>If fame is a reputation earned by achievement, and celebrity is just the fame of being famous, as Daniel Boorstin once suggested, what do you call achievement without much fame or any celebrity? The answer for today: Nathan Lyons. A photographer, Mr. Lyons has had a major impact on his field for close to four decades, yet very few people other than photographers and photography experts know his name, and not even many experts are familiar with much of his work.</p>
        <p>Part of the reason might be diffidence, selflessness, possibly even preference. Mr. Lyons's outstanding contribution has been in education, where he has broadened approaches to photography, and he has also been a force for change in his roles as curator, editor and writer.</p>
        <p>Still, his invisibility is uncommon. Curators like John Szarkowski, a former director of the Museum of Modern Art's department of photography, or Cornell Capa, founder of the International Center of Photography, effectively put their photographic careers on hold to do their museum jobs well. (I once asked Mr. Capa to take my picture. He had to borrow a camera to do so.)</p>
        <p>But the important teachers, like Harry Callahan, Aaron Siskind and Minor White, have usually been active photographers who have shown and published whenever they could. Though Mr. Lyons has remained an active photographer, he has published and exhibited his work only sparingly. His last book was published in 1974.</p>
        <p>It's a new millenium, and he has another book -- and two exhibitions in New York: ''Nathan Lyons: Riding First Class on the Titanic'' at the International Center of Photography, and ''Nathan Lyons: Notations'' at the Howard Greenberg Gallery in Soho. Last night the I.C.P. gave Mr. Lyons its Infinity Award for Lifetime Achievement in Photography.</p>
        <p>The 200 photographs at the I.C.P. are from the new book ''Riding First Class on the Titanic!'' published by the MIT Press and the Addison Gallery of American Art at Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., which organized the show. Twenty-nine of the 69 photographs at Howard Greenberg come from the 1974 book ''Notations in Passing''; the rest include some seldom-seen, nearly abstract work from the late 1950's and early 1960's.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lyons devises sequences of photographs that make allusive, open-ended, determinedly undogmatic comments on the American scene and culture. The photographs, all black-and-white and usually mounted as diptychs, are arranged in groups of, say, 8 or 12 pictures, all untitled and undated, and some from 10 or 20 years and hundreds of miles apart. They are essays without concluding paragraphs, commentaries that go off at tangents and leave gaps, encouraging the viewer to fill in the blanks with associations from personal experience.</p>
        <p>These are one man's visual observations presented as invitations to a dialogue. Meanings, never reliably precise, shift as image is added to image. The mind ricochets lightly off juxtapositions that may not be connected in some linear or obvious fashion but do not seem haphazard.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lyons, schooled in literature and drama, thinks of photography as a system similar to linguistics. In language, words affect one another. The word ''chair'' brings a picture to mind; add ''electric'' and the picture changes; add ''table'' or ''high'' or ''calls to order'' and it keeps changing. Similarly, if less specifically, when a newspaper advertisement for brassieres sits beneath a photograph of flood victims, the two images affect each other in peculiar ways, though defining exactly how may be difficult.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lyons's sequences are difficult in their way, too; they demand time and thought. (For an early foray into photographic sequences, differently conceived, see ''Kurt Kranz: Bauhaus 1930-1933'' in Gallery 292, Greenberg's annex gallery.) In ''Notations in Passing,'' Mr. Lyons's pictures were largely about vernacular public images: ads, posters, graffito drawings, display mannequins. In ''Riding First Class on the Titanic,'' they are primarily about vernacular language in graffiti and signs, ads and bumper stickers.</p>
        <p>Some are funny: ''Parking for Realities Customers Only.'' Some are sardonic: the word ''Signs'' has dropped its g (so easily do sins take over) and it won't do you much good to ride first class on the Titanic. Some have obvious relations to their neighbors: a bumper sticker that says ''I May Rise but I Refuse to Shine'' faces a partially effaced sign that includes the word ''Lazarus.'' Others comment on their neighbors: posters of John Wayne and of Sylvester Stallone playing Rambo face a wall with the words ''Cosmetics'' and ''The War Game.'' Some of the comments are uneasy: ''Jesus Heals'' faces ''What?''</p>
        <p>These are good pictures but not drop-dead images; they don't even try to knock you off your feet. Rather, they are little apercus of offbeat moments that, when sequenced, add up to more than the sum of their parts. Scrupulously refraining from didactics, they refuse to say exactly what viewers should think. They maintain a certain emotional reserve even in their judgment of American culture, which appears to be as hard to fall in love with as it is to condemn in its entirety -- and is in any event impossible to ignore.</p>
        <p>They are, in short, like Mr. Lyons's career: self-effacing, immensely thoughtful, with a broad conception of photography's potential to interact with viewers and with society in general. At the George Eastman House in Rochester, from 1958 to 1969, he promoted new photographers in publications and in exhibitions, like ''Toward a Social Landscape,'' that had a cultural slant. He was the first chairman of the Society for Photographic Education in 1963, and in 1983 initiated Oracle, an annual meeting of curators and program directors in photography. He is currently working with the Rochester public schools to develop a curriculum in media education.</p>
        <p>In 1969 Mr. Lyons founded the Visual Studies Workshop for graduate study in Rochester, which he still directs. Before, the few places that offered photographic studies based them on the formalist art-historical model. The workshop considered photography and related media in the context of popular culture and cultural history, at a time when photographers like Lee Friedlander and Garry Winogrand were paying attention but educators were not.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lyons taught by fostering philosophical investigation rather than a set of givens or conclusions. The curriculum included film and video, media issues and the early postmodernist notion that interpretation depended on the viewer as much as the thing viewed.</p>
        <p>Students gained real-word experience in the workshop's gallery or at Afterimage, the visual studies magazine Mr. Lyons founded in 1972 (it is still publishing), but they were not necessarily groomed to be gallery stars or even to make single images that aspired to stardom.</p>
        <p>The Visual Studies Workshop produced many talented photographers and teachers and an astonishing number of directors of photographic departments and of museums, including James Borcoman, formerly at the National Gallery of Canada; Diana Edkins, former curator of photographs at Conde Nast; Charles Desmarais at the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati; Willis Hartshorn at the I.C.P.; Charles Stainback at the Tang Museum at Skidmore College; Anne W. Tucker at the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston and Adam Weinberg at the Addison Gallery. In many ways, but especially through his students, Mr. Lyons has helped shape the current perception of photography.</p>
        <p>That is influence, and that's a sequence, too, as open-ended as ever a sequence was.</p>
        <p>''Nathan Lyons: Riding First Class on the Titanic'' is at the International Center of Photography, Fifth Avenue at 94th Street, (212) 860-1777, through June 18. ''Nathan Lyons: Notations'' is at the Howard Greenberg Gallery, 120 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 334-0010, through June 3.</p>
