        <p>D-L Alvarez, an American living in Berlin, has created a kind of Gothic mystery story in this psychological maze of a show titled ''Sculpture Garden.''

        <p>Derek Eller Gallery</p>
        <p>529 West 20th Street, Chelsea</p>
        <p>Through May 20</p>
        <p>D-L Alvarez, an American living in Berlin, has created a kind of Gothic mystery story in this psychological maze of a show titled ''Sculpture Garden.'' Visually unassuming, it's pieced together from a patchwork of subtly planted clues -- literary references, images of nature, fantasies of illicit encounters -- that avoid reaching a clear denouement.</p>
        <p>In the center of the gallery a tree hangs upside down by a noose, with swatches of torn fabric sewn around its branches. A forest scene is depicted as a paint-by-numbers puzzle, each section keyed to a handwritten text. A peephole reveals a video of empty park benches. Four architectural models of shedlike public toilets sit in vitrines; a faint mural-like pencil drawing covers a wall.</p>
        <p>The wall drawing, it turns out, is meant to depict an auto-erotic death by hanging (though it's hard to decipher a coherent image). The cloth stitched to the tree is a cut-up suit worn by the artist in a performance. The park benches are gay cruising spots in Berlin, as are the toilets. The texts that accompany the woodland scene are excerpts from novels of radical social estrangement, from Jean Genet's homoerotic classic ''Miracle of the Rose'' to Mary Shelley's ''Frankenstein''</p>
        <p>Shelley's cobbled-together creature, superhuman in strength but swayed by tender emotions, is a monstrous innocent, a noncontender for Eden. Mr. Alvarez has made him, by implication at least, a central player in this fastidiously plotted roman a clef of a show, but his story is left open-ended, his fate inconclusive.</p>
