        <p>Menus for Moms</p>
        <p>If you're still trying to decide where to take Mom on Sunday to celebrate Mother's Day, here are 12 places offering special menus to help make her day special. (These summaries are taken from dining reviews, columns and articles in The Times by William Grimes, Eric Asimov and others.)</p>
        <p>1. American Park At the Battery  *  [Rating: 1 star]</p>
        <p>(212) 809-5508</p>
        <p>Off State Street,</p>
        <p>at the Battery</p>
        <p>Lower Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Eating at American Park is like dining at a seaside resort without leaving Manhattan. The Statue of Liberty is so close it's within hailing distance. The owners, Jeanne and Frank Cretella (who also own Park View in Central Park), have done their best to live up to the location. They have spared no expense in turning a maintenance building into an upscale restaurant. The chef, Rad Matmati, is offering a $55 prix fixe menu for Mother's Day. Selections include appetizers like chilled yellow tomato soup with avocado and coriander, and seared crab cake with salad; entree choices like grilled filet mignon with caramelized onions, corn and red wine nage, or grilled salmon with guacamole, black bean salsa and tomato vinaigrette; and desserts like chilled melon soup with champagne and cucumber-honeydew sorbet, and lemon cake with strawberry compote.</p>
        <p>2. La Caravelle  ***  [Rating: 3 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 586-4252</p>
        <p>33 West 55th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>La Caravelle is a French restaurant of the old school, one of the last places in New York that make you feel like dressing up. No restaurant in the city does a better job of guarding its traditions while honoring the present. La Caravelle recently changed chefs, with Eric Di Domenico taking over for Cyril Renaud. Mr. Di Domenico has created a three-course, $68 prix fixe menu for Mother's Day. Appetizer choices include shrimp salad with hibiscus flower vinaigrette, Provencal fish soup with saffron, and sauteed duck foie gras with figs and almond emulsion. Entrees include braised fillet of snapper with a red-wine mustard; lobster with tomato confit, saffron and orange blossom water; and crisp roast duck with cranberries. Desserts include Grand Marnier, chocolate and mint souffles; mango tart with Tanzanian tea ice cream; and milk chocolate cake with caramel and lime.</p>
        <p>3. Chelsea Bistro and Bar  **  [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 727-2026</p>
        <p>358 West 23rd Street</p>
        <p>Chelsea</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>With classic bistro accouterments like cozy banquettes hugging one wall, brass rails, mirrors and a working fireplace, this four-year-old restaurant looks as if it was airlifted from Paris. A $45 prix fixe menu is offered for Mother's Day. The three-course menu has appetizers like lump crab meat ravioli with vegetable champagne sauce, and Caesar salad garnished with quail eggs. Among the main courses are grilled Chilean sea bass with mashed sweet potatoes and spring vegetables, and roast duck prepared two ways with baked caramelized peaches and wild rice in a pineapple and port wine sauce. For dessert, choose from chocolate tart a la mode, lemon meringue tart, creme brulee and peach melba.</p>
        <p>4. Gotham Bar and Grill  ***  [Rating: 3 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 620-4020</p>
        <p>12 East 12th Street</p>
        <p>Greenwich Village</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>In many ways, Gotham is a quintessential New York restaurant, a vast, comfortable space that manages to offer intimacy, too. Starched men in suits mingle with rumpled guys in blue jeans, and no one looks out of place. Waiters are remarkably sensitive to your wishes, going into great detail about food and wine, or not. The chef, Alfred Portale, is offering two prix-fixe menus, a three-course lunch for $45 and dinner for $75. Selections include appetizers of sweet prawn and baby artichoke risotto with prosciutto di Parma, lemon and chervil butter; and diver sea scallop carpaccio with baby red kale, cracked coriander seed and lime emulsion. Entrees include rack of lamb with Swiss chard, roasted shallots and garlic mashed potatoes; and roasted Maine lobster tails with fingerling potatoes, savoy cabbage, whole garlic and flageolet. Desserts include bittersweet chocolate tiramisu with Kahlua-soaked ladyfingers; and a creme fraiche and espresso ice cream pop.</p>
        <p>5. Les Halles  **  [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 679-4111</p>
        <p>411 Park Avenue South,  near 29th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Taking its name from the legendary wholesale food market in Paris, Les Halles also functions as a meat market: it has butcher cases in the front and a room with the air of a real Parisian brasserie in the back, with wood molding, off-white walls tulip sconces and tables draped in butcher paper. In addition to the regular menu, Les Halles is offering a special three-course Mother's Day brunch for $19.99. The appetizers are chilled asparagus bisque with white truffle oil, and market salad with fresh herbs, shrimp and citrus vinaigrette; and the entrees are half a lobster stuffed with crab meat and avocado, and chicken breast with summer truffles. Dessert is a frozen raspberry parfait.</p>
        <p>6. Judson Grill  ***  [Rating: 3 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 582-5252</p>
        <p>152 West 52nd Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Bill Telepan, the chef, is committed to freshness; it is the key to the quiet but eloquent flavors he offers on his contemporary American menu. The food is unassuming but extremely eloquent, so roaring with flavor that the minute you finish one bite you instantly want another. The $58 prix fixe Mother's Day menu features appetizers like peekytoe crab cocktail served with osetra caviar, avocado, scallion and lemon verbena vinaigrette; house-smoked brook trout; and asparagus salad with pistachios, baby greens and lemon. Main courses include artichoke-crusted salmon with braised artichokes, white beans and spinach; lobster risotto with spring vegetables and fines herbes; and grilled sirloin with porcini, ramps, fava beans and potato puree. For dessert, choose from cappuccino-chocolate cake, spring carrot pudding, ricotta mousse and raspberry-violet custard.</p>
        <p>7. Lenox Room  **  [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 772-0404</p>
        <p>1278 Third Avenue, near 73rd Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Some of the most inventive food on the Upper East Side is served in the Lenox Room's clubby atmosphere. The loud, lively place attracts people who are not so hip or so young as the downtown crowd, but they clearly know how to have a good time. The Lenox Room is offering a Mother's Day brunch for $30, with appetizers like blue point oysters, yellowfin tuna tartare, and chilled lobster and crab salad, and main dishes like cinnamon vanilla French toast with strawberries and bananas; sirloin steak and eggs; and lobster Cobb salad. Dinner is also being served, with appetizer choices like steamed jumbo shrimp, Maryland-style crab cakes, and parfait of foie gras and chicken liver.  Main courses include Virginia country ham with pineapple glaze and potato gratin, and roast free-range chicken with sauteed asparagus and new potatoes.</p>
        <p>8. Le Madri  **  [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 727-8022</p>
        <p>168 West 18th Street</p>
        <p>Chelsea</p>
        <p>$$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Le Madri's splendid, airy Tuscan-style setting is effectively evoked by its vaulted ceiling supported by columns, strategically aimed overhead lights, well-placed tables and exposed wood-burning tile oven in the dining room. The original idea was great: import some Italian mamas to do some serious Tuscan home cooking. The moms may all have gone, but Le Madri continues to be the model for dozens of northern Italian restaurants with similar menus. Flowers are featured on the Mother's Day menu, with dishes like Mother's Day flowering spring soup with violets, primulas and dandelion blossoms; lobster and Moet &amp; Chandon rose risotto garnished with edible orchids; grilled filet mignon with spring garlic mashed potatoes, cinnamon-scented snow peas and baby carrots; and for dessert, chilled spring fruit martini with cantaloupe juice and spring petals. The regular menu is also available.</p>
        <p>9. Molyvos  ***  [Rating: 3 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 582-7500</p>
        <p>871 Seventh Avenue, near 55th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>As casual, hospitable and lively as a Greek taverna, Molyvos offers food by people who passionately want you to love it. In addition to the regular menu, Molyvos is offering special dishes for Mother's Day, available both a la carte and in a prix fixe four-course dinner for $45. The specials  include seared jumbo sea scallop saganaki with lemon, scallions and feta; roasted Vermont baby lamb with artichoke, fava beans and tomato stew with red wine sauce; herb-roasted halibut with anise-scented baby fennel and sweet onion broth; and for dessert, walnut cake with spiced honey syrup and yogurt whipped cream.</p>
        <p>10. Monkey Bar  **  [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 838-2600</p>
        <p>60 East 54th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Once you get past the raucous smoke-filled bar in the front, you enter a sophisticated, comfortable Art Deco room where every meal is a glamorous occasion. For Mother's Day, the chef, Andrew Chase, is offering a three-course prix fixe menu for $65, with appetizers like spring garlic soup, lobster salad and cured salmon with caviar. Entrees include salmon confit, thyme-crusted tuna and filet mignon. For dessert, choose from warm chocolate macadamia cake, upside-down apple tart, strawberry layer cake and creme brulee.</p>
        <p>11. Oceana  ***  [Rating: 3 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 759-5941</p>
        <p>55 East 54th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Rick Moonen, the chef at this sedate, intimate Midtown restaurant, has mastered the art of cooking fish and uses accents from all over the world to enhance the essential nature of each kind. For Mother's Day, Oceana is serving a three-course prix fixe menu for $65. In addition to the regular menu, asparagus specials include a clear asparagus broth with rock shrimp and sprinkled with a julienne of herbed crepes and ramps; white asparagus vichyssoise with lobster; white asparagus salad; and pan-seared halibut steak with steamed white and green asparagus, fresh morel cream, herbed fingerling potatoes and spicy micro greens.</p>
        <p>12. Windows on the World  **  [Rating: 2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 524-7000</p>
        <p>1 World Trade Center (107th Floor)</p>
        <p>West Street</p>
        <p>Lower Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Nobody goes to Windows on the World just to eat, but even the fussiest food person can be content dining at one of New York's favorite tourist destinations. The executive chef, Michael Lomonaco, is offering three prix fixe menus, including a special children's menu for $32.50 featuring appetizers like cheese-filled ravioli with tomato sauce, and fruit salad ambrosia with tiny marshmallows; and entrees like homemade turkey pot pie, and chicken fingers with honey-mustard sauce. The four-course adult menu ($65) offers a choice of appetizers, which include oak-smoked salmon and rock shrimp crab cake, and entrees of pan-roasted red snapper, roasted young spring chicken with black truffle sauce, and rack of lamb with rosemary sauce. The third menu, a three-course brunch for $30, is being served next door at the Greatest Bar on Earth.</p>
