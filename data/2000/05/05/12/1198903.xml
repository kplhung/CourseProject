        <p>Fed by winds gusting up to 50 miles per hour, a wildfire resumed its path of devastation today, forcing the evacuation of as many as 25,000 people and destroying at least 260 homes but apparently not causing serious damage at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where nuclear weapons are designed.</p>
        <p>Officials warned that there was still little chance of bringing the blaze under control until the weather changed. And local and national officials have begun to express anger at the National Park Service, which set what it had hoped would be a controlled fire a week ago before high winds sent it racing across heavily wooded canyons toward the populated areas.</p>

        <p>Fed by winds gusting up to 50 miles per hour, a wildfire resumed its path of devastation today, forcing the evacuation of as many as 25,000 people and destroying at least 260 homes but apparently not causing serious damage at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where nuclear weapons are designed.</p>
        <p>Officials warned that there was still little chance of bringing the blaze under control until the weather changed. And local and national officials have begun to express anger at the National Park Service, which set what it had hoped would be a controlled fire a week ago before high winds sent it racing across heavily wooded canyons toward the populated areas.</p>
        <p>As word spread here that the National Weather Service had warned before the fire was set that high winds were expected, the Interior Department, which operates the Park Service, announced late in the day that Roy Weaver, the superintendent of the Bandelier National Monument, where the fire was set, had been placed on administrative leave pending an investigation.</p>
        <p>''I believe someone is responsible,'' Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, said at a news conference here this morning. ''The person in charge at the Park Service who authorized the burn is most responsible.'' Mr. Domenici said he intended to ask for a federal investigation of the plan.</p>
        <p>Although about 20,000 acres have burned and more than 1,000 emergency and fire personnel are fighting the blaze, no injuries have been reported, and the hasty evacuation of the huge number of people was described as orderly.</p>
        <p>But Los Alamos presented a disconcerting tableau today. Fire vehicles rushed about its blackened streets, the skies were dark with thick plumes of smoke, and helicopters whirred overhead, carrying huge buckets of water. Most neighborhoods presented an eerie checkerboard of destruction, with houses seemingly selected at random for total destruction alongside other homes left unscathed.</p>
        <p>Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who flew in from a conference in San Diego this morning, said the Los Alamos National Laboratory had suffered some fire damage but was secure. Energy Department officials said the fire had passed over some concrete and earth bunkers where conventional explosives are stored, causing no damage. The officials said that at one point the fire had come within 300 yards of a building where plutonium is stored but that the building is heavily fortified and is safe. Though some nuclear material is stored at the laboratory, there are no nuclear weapons there.</p>
        <p>Mr. Richardson said there were no signs that any radiation had been released.</p>
        <p>Of the 11,000 people who work at the laboratory, only security guards and one dozen or two dozen people working in the emergency operations center remain, said Kay Roybal, a spokeswoman for the laboratory.</p>
        <p>Ms. Roybal would not speculate on how experiments might be affected by the closing of the laboratory but said that scientists each year must plan around a shutdown from Christmas through Jan. 1. ''I think there are ways to handle most of that,'' she said. ''Whether people had time to do that this time, I can't say.''</p>
        <p>Each day of the shutdown costs $3.5 million to $5 million in salaries.</p>
        <p>At first, just the 11,000 or so residents of Los Alamos, a town high on a mesa at about 7,200 feet, had been evacuated. But starting last night and then throughout the day today the residents of the nearby towns of White Rock and Abiqui and areas in the Espanola Valley were told to leave. Abiqui is famous for having been the home of the painter Georgia O'Keefe for many years, and much of her work is still kept there.</p>
        <p>A local radio station took calls from people all day who recounted having been given just minutes to clear out of their homes. Many said they had had time to do little more than throw some clothes into garbage bags, grab their children and pets and flee, with the smoke and flames visible nearby.</p>
        <p>In the streets of Los Alamos, the heat of the fires transformed many houses, cars, utility poles and lawns into cinders. Typical was 49th Street in the western part of the city, where the once tidy homes were razed in twos and threes, while other homes close by were untouched, the grass of their lawns still green.</p>
        <p>Viola Stowe, a resident of the city, who had been evacuated to a shelter at a high school in Espanola, said she had watched a house burn on the television news last night, and only when the camera pulled back did she realize it was her own.</p>
        <p>''You don't plan for these things,'' she said. ''You don't think it'll happen to you.''</p>
        <p>President Clinton declared the region a disaster area on Wednesday, making it eligible for federal aid.</p>
        <p>Today in Washington, when asked about the government's liability for the fire, the president said, ''We have to look in to see what the real facts are and what the responsibility of the government is.</p>
        <p>''Right now we should be focusing on doing everything we can to minimize the damage of the fire and protect the lab assets, deal with the human problems,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>Emergency officials flew here today from Washington to help control the fire and to plan relief efforts.</p>
        <p>The fire was burning to the north and to the northeast today, away from populated areas. But firefighters were concerned, in part because the flames were spewing burning chunks of wood thousands of feet into  the air, where they were blown as far as a mile and starting new fires.</p>
        <p>Kevin Purtymun, a Los Alamos police officer, said another concern was that because the fires had left many houses and trees standing, there was still plenty of fuel if the  blaze roared across the city again.</p>
        <p>''Really, anything can happen now,'' said Mike Gowey, a Forest Service firefighter. ''There are spot fires everywhere. This is nowhere near under control.''</p>
        <p>The National Park Service defended the practice of setting controlled, or ''prescribed,'' fires, saying the fires are an essential means of heading off devastating accidental fires in forests that have grown overly dense because of fire suppression over the years.</p>
        <p>''The purpose of a prescribed burn is to eliminate underbrush to head off catastrophic fires,'' said Michael Gauldin, the chief spokesman for the Interior Department. He said such burns were conducted over millions of acres every year, by the Forest Service, the Park Service and the Bureau of Land Management.</p>
        <p>The fire was set last Thursday as part of an effort by officials at Bandelier National Monument to thin out some of the dense growth that makes the pine forests in the region among the most combustible in the country.  Park Service officials said they had weighed all the factors before deciding to go ahead with the burn, including the density of the growth, the moisture in the wood, the relative humidity, the temperature and the wind speed.</p>
        <p>''The data and the spot weather forecasts met the fire prescription,''  the Bandelier superintendent, Mr. Weaver, said in an interview before his suspension was announced. ''It's not like someone was just picking things out of the air.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Weaver said the fire team had requested and received weather updates throughout the day, as late as two hours before the flames were ignited at 7:20 p.m. on Thursday. Seeing no reason to call off the plan, the crew set the fire. Then, he said, the winds whipped up unexpectedly, and the flames began spreading toward Los Alamos.</p>
        <p>About seven hours before the fire was set, the National Weather Service office in Albuquerque faxed a report, requested by Bandelier, predicting that winds on the ridge tops would increase to 10 to 15 m.p.h. that evening, gusting to 20 m.p.h. the next day. The report also said relative humidity would not increase as much as it normally does in the evening, a factor that would increase the risk of the fire's spreading.</p>
        <p>Dr. Wallace Covington, a professor at Northern Arizona University's  School of Forestry in Flagstaff, said that these numbers, while not ideal, would not rule out a burn. If the ground is too wet and the air too still, he said, a burn will not do its job.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weaver said his staff had tried  a controlled burn in the same area in fall 1992, when the air was more humid and still. ''It accomplished nothing,'' Mr. Weaver said. ''We wasted our time and resources.''</p>
