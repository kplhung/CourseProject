        <p>Racing to keep up with a booming economy, President Clinton today proposed an increase of more than 85 percent in the number of skilled foreign workers who could be admitted to the United States to fill job openings in high-technology industries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton asked Congress to provide 200,000 visas for such workers in each of the next three years. The existing law, adopted in 1998, limits the number of such visas to 107,500 in 2001. After that, under existing law, the ceiling will fall back to 65,000 a year, the level in effect before Congressional action in 1998.</p>

        <p>Racing to keep up with a booming economy, President Clinton today proposed an increase of more than 85 percent in the number of skilled foreign workers who could be admitted to the United States to fill job openings in high-technology industries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton asked Congress to provide 200,000 visas for such workers in each of the next three years. The existing law, adopted in 1998, limits the number of such visas to 107,500 in 2001. After that, under existing law, the ceiling will fall back to 65,000 a year, the level in effect before Congressional action in 1998.</p>
        <p>In January 1998, the Clinton administration said it did not support an increase in the number of visas. But the president, under pressure from Congress and the computer industry, agreed to support a modest increase six months later. Since then, technology companies say, the demand for computer programmers, engineers and other skilled workers has outstripped the supply and exceeded official expectations.</p>
        <p>Many in Congress favor an even bigger increase than the one Mr. Clinton proposed today. Congress therefore appears likely to approve a substantial increase in the number of visas, known as H-1B visas, for high-technology workers.</p>
        <p>Robert Cohen, senior vice president of the Information Technology Association of America, an industry group, welcomed the president's proposal.</p>
        <p>''It's very encouraging that the White House sees the need to raise the cap,'' Mr. Cohen said. ''The administration understands better now than in 1998 that information technology gives an incredible push to the overall economy. But the number of visas proposed by the administration is probably not adequate. We would be pleased to see the cap eliminated, so the marketplace could decide how many people are needed to get the job done.''</p>
        <p>Nations in Europe and Asia are competing for the same pool of high-technology workers. And Senator Spencer Abraham, Republican of Michigan, said some American companies would ''move their operations overseas, taking American jobs with them,'' if they could not get the workers they needed here.</p>
        <p>India provides by far the largest number of skilled foreign workers under the H-1B visa program. Its citizens received 47 percent of such visas issued in the last year. The next largest share went to China, with 9 percent.</p>
        <p>Gene Sperling, the president's economic policy adviser, set forth Mr. Clinton's proposal in a letter to Congress.</p>
        <p>The best way to increase the supply of skilled workers is to improve the education and training of United States citizens and other people already in the country, Mr. Sperling said.</p>
        <p>''However,'' he said, ''at times, U.S. businesses need additional access to the international labor market to maintain and enhance our global competitiveness, particularly in high-growth new technology industries and particularly in tight labor markets.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sperling said the previous increase in the number of H-1B visas had proved inadequate because ''our economy has grown beyond anyone's most optimistic predictions.''</p>
        <p>Representative Lamar Smith, the Texas Republican who heads the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, was skeptical, saying, ''There is still no objective, credible study that documents a shortage of American high-tech workers.''</p>
        <p>Michael W. Gildea, a policy analyst in the professional employee division of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said: ''We would have preferred no increase in the number of visas. We see no credible evidence of widespread shortages of information technology workers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sperling said technology companies appeared to have difficulty finding workers with the necessary skills. But he added, ''The lack of clear data suggests that it's best to offer a temporary solution, and to make that solution contingent on an increase in spending for the education and training of American workers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton proposed a sharp increase in the fees charged to employers who use the foreign worker program. He said the fee for an H-1B visa, now $500, should be raised to $2,000 for most employers, with a visa fee of $3,000 for companies that depend heavily on skilled foreign workers.</p>
        <p>The president said he would use the fees to help pay for the training of American workers, especially those who are underrepresented in the information technology industry, like women, blacks and Hispanics.</p>
