        <p>Selections by Torsten Wiesel</p>
        <p>Pace/MacGill Gallery</p>
        <p>32 East 57th Street</p>
        <p>Through June 17</p>
        <p>This selection of 25 works from the collection of Dr. Torsten Wiesel, the Nobel Prize-winning neurobiologist, is a result of a discerning eye that has ranged across cultures and centuries. What's on view is an eclectic mix of choice objects that run from pre-Columbian figures in jade and clay to a 1986 drawing by Brice Marden and a 1997 sculpture-painting by William Christenberry.</p>
        <p>In between there are such treasures as a woodblock print of a lavishly robed Etruscan courtesan (circa 1859) by the 19th-century Japanese artist Utamaro; a powerful Fang male reliquary figure from Gabon (undated) with a popped-out belly button; a tiny but horrific etching by Goya of a bound prisoner (1867); an African-influenced photo-collage (circa 1920) of a grotesquely large-headed woman by the German artist Hannah Hoch; a playful box by Joseph Cornell (untitled and undated); and a gleeful drawing (1964) by Saul Steinberg of a sniffing bunny caged in a man's head.</p>

        <p>In between there are such treasures as a woodblock print of a lavishly robed Etruscan courtesan (circa 1859) by the 19th-century Japanese artist Utamaro; a powerful Fang male reliquary figure from Gabon (undated) with a popped-out belly button; a tiny but horrific etching by Goya of a bound prisoner (1867); an African-influenced photo-collage (circa 1920) of a grotesquely large-headed woman by the German artist Hannah Hoch; a playful box by Joseph Cornell (untitled and undated); and a gleeful drawing (1964) by Saul Steinberg of a sniffing bunny caged in a man's head.</p>
        <p>Although an attempt has been made through the careful juxtaposition of objects to show relationships across the centuries, the show provides no rationale as to why the scientist made his particular choices. But never mind. Even among scientists, the eye has its reasons that logic knows not of.</p>
        <p>Dr. Wiesel, whose research has brought about greater understanding of brain development, structure and function, also contributes an enlightening video that traces the process of visual perception in cells of a monkey's brain. It does not explain, either, why monkeys, artists and collectors latch on to certain images they cherish, but it gives a hint of what happens before they do.</p>
