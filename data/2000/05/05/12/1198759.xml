        <p>Once again I wanted a romantic weekend, and I wanted it in a hurry. The Eastern Shore of Maryland, a two-hour drive from Philadelphia, where I live, seemed a good bet for that and for an early taste of spring. I had never been there, but my friend Lou, who had made one visit with his son, said he remembered charming small towns and farmland spilling down to the Chesapeake Bay.</p>
        <p>Charming was fine, but I was after a bit of luxury as well, so I went to the Web. Within seconds, the Ashby 1663 appeared: a ''stately, historic'' bed-and-breakfast on the banks of the Miles River in Easton. It promised everything I was looking for: stately and historic, plus ''romantic, alluring, luxury, magnificent views.'' Perfect.</p>
        <p>While there were slightly less expensive rooms in other buildings on the property, the rooms in the Ashby itself ranged from a pricey $265 a night to an astonishing $595. For a bed-and-breakfast? I booked the $295-a-night room, which promised a ''spacious private bath with large skylight'' and a ''beautiful water view.'' (A person can adjust amazingly quickly to an expense account.) Moments later, craving still more romance and luxury -- specifically $80 more romance and luxury -- I was back on the phone, trying to switch to the $375-a-night room, which promised a ''private deck off the bedroom with a broad 10-mile view in each direction, overlooking the water'' and a ''large private bath with gigantic whirlpool tub.'' Alas, that room was taken.</p>

        <p>Once again I wanted a romantic weekend, and I wanted it in a hurry. The Eastern Shore of Maryland, a two-hour drive from Philadelphia, where I live, seemed a good bet for that and for an early taste of spring. I had never been there, but my friend Lou, who had made one visit with his son, said he remembered charming small towns and farmland spilling down to the Chesapeake Bay.</p>
        <p>Charming was fine, but I was after a bit of luxury as well, so I went to the Web. Within seconds, the Ashby 1663 appeared: a ''stately, historic'' bed-and-breakfast on the banks of the Miles River in Easton. It promised everything I was looking for: stately and historic, plus ''romantic, alluring, luxury, magnificent views.'' Perfect.</p>
        <p>While there were slightly less expensive rooms in other buildings on the property, the rooms in the Ashby itself ranged from a pricey $265 a night to an astonishing $595. For a bed-and-breakfast? I booked the $295-a-night room, which promised a ''spacious private bath with large skylight'' and a ''beautiful water view.'' (A person can adjust amazingly quickly to an expense account.) Moments later, craving still more romance and luxury -- specifically $80 more romance and luxury -- I was back on the phone, trying to switch to the $375-a-night room, which promised a ''private deck off the bedroom with a broad 10-mile view in each direction, overlooking the water'' and a ''large private bath with gigantic whirlpool tub.'' Alas, that room was taken.</p>
        <p>And so it was that late one Friday night we were traveling down a narrow, nubby tar road through the woods toward the inn. We were almost there when we became aware that the night was full of peeps. We slowed the car to a stop and rolled down the windows, and in came the cool, damp air. We realized we were listening to the early springtime sound of frogs. We were in the country now. So far, so good.</p>
        <p>We went the additional half-mile, past rows of old oak trees that lined the road to what had once been a plantation house. At the end of the road, a white mansion with Greek Revival columns and a wide porch glowed with what seemed like a hundred lights. As we pulled into the parking lot, we heard a different kind of music: Roy Orbison, blasting from an S.U.V. Two well-dressed couples spilled out of the vehicle, laughing and talking loudly and carrying their party into the house. Rowdy guests? What was this?</p>
        <p>We were swept inside the house with the group, and as we tried to make introductions and find out where our room was, we discovered that one couple were our hosts. The woman, Jeanie Wagner, a slender, striking blonde with a soft Southern accent, welcomed us warmly, grabbed our luggage and led us through a parlor and up a grand polished staircase to our room.</p>
        <p>It was pretty enough, but as we looked around, we noticed that the windows were few, and small. Jeanie, as she insisted we call her, registered our disappointment instantly.</p>
        <p>''Oh, are you Window People?'' she asked.</p>
        <p>Yes. We were.</p>
        <p>No problem. She took us down the hall to what turned out to be the more expensive room I had tried to book on second thought. It had plenty of large windows. ''This one has a balcony,'' Jeanie said, leading us outside. A balcony? We walked onto a deck that seemed to be the size of a tennis court. She pointed out the magnolia tree in full bloom below and the swimming pool. The pool was not yet ready for the season, but who cared? We had the whirlpool tub, which was indeed gigantic.</p>
        <p>''Someone else has this room tomorrow night,'' she said, smiling and clearly having fun. ''But I can fix that. I'll upgrade them to another room. I don't think they'll mind.''</p>
        <p>How could they? They were just about to enjoy $220 more luxury in the $595 room -- actually, it was a suite -- and since no one had it for the night Jeanie let us have a look. It was spectacular, with floor-to-ceiling French windows all around, a king-size four-poster canopy bed, a private porch and a marble bathroom, with a fireplace, a whirlpool and a double shower bigger than some Manhattan apartments.</p>
        <p>Jeanie took off her high heels and led us on a quick tour of the house, through the common rooms and into the gleaming white kitchen with potpourri filling one of the sinks. She opened the refrigerator and the drawers of the pantry, taking out bags of cookies and nuts and crackers, and showed us the well-stocked guest bar. Small dishes of M&amp;M's were scattered on tables throughout the downstairs. I confess to a fondness for M&amp;M's, but somehow they seemed incongruous in such a setting.</p>
        <p>''This is your house,'' Jeanie said. ''Take whatever you want. Life is about enjoying yourself. You're alone here tonight.'' We were the only occupants of the five guest rooms in the main house. She took us downstairs to a small exercise room with its walls plastered with local real estate listings. Her partner, Cliff Meredith, who owns the Ashby and renovated it, is a developer, she told us.</p>
        <p>Rolling in Luxury</p>
        <p>Alone in the big house, we unpacked, put on our white terry cloth bathrobes with the gold Ashby insignias and went down, barefoot, to enjoy our house. We poured ourselves brandy, which we don't particularly like but felt the surroundings demanded, and sat on one of the rust-colored Colonial-reproduction sofas in the living room, looking out into the night. Sated with that, we then sat on the teal-and-burgundy Colonial-style sofa in the parlor across the room from the grand piano. We nibbled on nuts. I ate a few M&amp;M's. We admired the opulence: Oriental rugs, fine china in glass cases, porcelain vases.</p>
        <p>Tomorrow we would set out in search of the Eastern Shore.</p>
        <p>The only thing about spending that much money on a room is that you feel you ought to stick around and make it worth it. Somehow it was important to us to soak up all the luxury.</p>
        <p>The next day began with a leisurely breakfast of homemade pancakes and fresh fruit in the dining room under the antique Waterford crystal chandelier. Jeanie, who in the light of the morning had adopted a more casual persona and had her long hair pulled into a ponytail, poured our coffee and said: ''Go to St. Michaels. You'll love it.'' It seems as if there are a few things in this part of the world that everyone takes for granted: one is that everyone loves eating and picking crabs. The other is that you will fall in love with St. Michaels.</p>
        <p>We drove to Oxford, a small town on the Tred Avon River with antiques shops and boatyards. We boarded the Oxford-Bellevue ferry, which has been operating since 1683, with our car. We joined the small crowd on the deck enjoying the sunshine and salt air. This was what we had come for. The day seemed full of promise.</p>
        <p>We drove to St. Michaels, where James A. Michener had lived while he was writing his epic novel ''Chesapeake,'' and went to the Crab Claw, on the Miles River, for lunch. It was too early for Maryland blue claw crabs but the crabs from North Carolina tasted pretty good to us. So did the fried oysters.</p>
        <p>Stuffed, we staggered up the main street, Talbot Street. The St. Michaels we found was an unremarkable collection of shops and tourists, of which we were two, and not particularly happy ones at that. It was not just that we both hate shopping. This was not the Eastern Shore of salty air and beautiful vistas and quaint crabbing towns that we had in mind.</p>
        <p>By the Book</p>
        <p>At this point, on Talbot Street, we were getting desperate. There had to be more to this area than endless shops with nautical themes. Lou and I typically improvise because we are both disorganized and tend to do things at the last minute; usually we get lucky and things work out. But now we needed help. With less than 36 hours left in our weekend, we bought a couple of guidebooks and a book on Maryland crabs.</p>
        <p>At the suggestion of the guidebooks, we wandered down to the Miles River waterfront to the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum. Here we would see a real celebration of the fishing, crabbing and waterfowling traditions of the Chesapeake Bay. We could admire the work boats used by the bay's watermen and the market gunners' log canoes, sneakboxes, bugeys, skiffs and punts. And who could forget the famous skipjack?</p>
        <p>Lou, who had been dragging on Talbot Street, came back to life. He loves knocking around any kind of boat, but these boats especially drew him because they were the boats of his boyhood on Barnegat Bay, in New Jersey. As a boy he had also spent a lot of time duck hunting and every once in a while he still gets a chance to go. He told me he would love to return to the Eastern Shore in the fall and sit in a duck blind with a spread of decoys and a Labrador retriever.</p>
        <p>We wandered into one shed that is dedicated to telling the story of men who hunted the plentiful waterfowl of the Eastern Shore and provided grand hotels and restaurants of an earlier era with ducks and geese by the boatload. The shed includes a decoy carver's bench and a guide to the region's most important carvers and their designs. Their work has come to be judged as American folk art, and there was a certain charm to seeing the authentic version of what had been crammed into the shops on Talbot Street.</p>
        <p>As we walked through, we were reminded of the central role Chesapeake Bay has played in the life of the Eastern Shore; the reason to visit it ultimately harks back to the water and the abundant natural life it sustains.</p>
        <p>We returned to the Ashby just in time for cocktails and hors d'oeuvres -- the smoked salmon was delicious and abundant -- and a lightning storm. The lightning and the rain made the living room feel cozy and brought the group together. Lou talked about trout fishing with a fellow fisherman from Virginia. I sat down with the lucky, and friendly, couple who had drawn the $595 room. He was an Annapolis graduate and a Navy officer in his mid-40's who had just retired. She was in her mid-30's and had something to do with marketing. They did not appear to be rich, and they made it clear that this was a very special weekend for them, and that they did not routinely stay in places like the Ashby.</p>
        <p>''What did you think when you found out that was your room?'' I asked them. The only problem, they said, was that they didn't want to leave.</p>
        <p>That evening we ventured into Easton, the main small city of this part of the Eastern Shore. We dined at a small, lovely American restaurant, the Columbia. Lou had roast rack of lamb with pistachio and raspberry sauce. I had chicken with shiitake risotto. Over dinner we hatched plans for the next day. No more desultory wandering for us. ''The Eastern Shore is about nature and the bay,'' Lou said. ''Let's go find it.''</p>
        <p>A Beckoning Call</p>
        <p>We were up early the next morning. We had pancakes and took our coffee out to the porch. While I went upstairs to get dressed, Lou took his fishing rod and went on the Ashby dock to cast. Unfortunately he was too early for the striped bass.</p>
        <p>After we had paid our bill and as we were driving away, we decided that whatever you expect for $295 a night, something was missing, even with our generous upgrade. Nothing specific could be faulted. The rooms were gorgeous. The breakfasts were good, but not exceptional. Jeanie was warm and hospitable as she was doling out upgrades the first night, but for the rest of the weekend our hosts were somewhat absent.</p>
        <p>But we didn't like spending that much money for what seemed as two-dimensional as a spread in Colonial Homes magazine. The Ashby was a showplace, yes, but it was on display, and we were only moving through it.</p>
        <p>Still, nature beckoned, and we headed south to the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, passing fruit trees and dogwoods in bloom. The refuge, established by the federal government in the 1930's, is made up of 23,000 acres of tidal marshes and woodlands on the Blackwater River near the mouth of the bay. It is a principal resting place for migrating birds, especially Canada geese, which catch their breath on the way south by the tens of thousands.</p>
        <p>We were late for the geese migration, but the preserve held plenty of other surprises for us: ospreys, red-winged blackbirds, mallards and broad expanses of feathery marsh grass that bowed before the bay's breezes like wheat in a Kansas field. The preserve is also home to bald eagles and the rare Delmarva fox squirrel, but we saw neither. We stopped at the guest center and rented a tape, our own little guide, that we could play in the car as we drove through the preserve.</p>
        <p>In the parking lot we popped the tape into the tape player and followed the prompts and directions over Blackwater's roads. We learned about the bluebirds that nest in the park and saw the boxes that had been set out as their homes. ''I would love to see a bluebird,'' Lou said. He had seen only two in his entire life.</p>
        <p>At one point we left the car (at the direction of the tape) and walked a trail through tall loblolly pines to the wide expanse of the Blackwater River. At the water's edge, we started our lifetime list of bird sightings (I am a bird illiterate and Lou was teaching me) and immediately made note of the mallards, the bluebills and the tiny black-and-white buffleheads. We returned to the car to complete the tour.</p>
        <p>With a park map spread out on the seat between us, we were concentrating so hard on the prompts on the tape that we managed to turn off the marked road and down a wrong trail. With the scenery being described by the voice on the tape bearing no resemblance to the scene outside the car, we turned around and headed back to Tape Station No. 1 to start over. Good thing this wasn't a safari.</p>
        <p>Once out of the park, we drove farther south, toward the Eastern Shore's archipelago and Hooper Island. We passed loblolly woodlands, russet marshes dotted with muskrat houses and duck blinds, and views of the rivers and bay, which sparkled so brightly in the late afternoon sun that we often had to squint along the narrow two-lane blacktop. This was an earlier and more beautiful Eastern Shore, and one that seems increasingly threatened by the sprawl to the north.</p>
        <p>We turned on to Maryland State Highway 335 and threaded our way to Hooper Island, a fishing and vacation village, that was reached over a series of bridges like the ones connecting the Florida Keys.</p>
        <p>We drove past weather-beaten bungalows with crab pots piled up outside. There were no shops, unless you count the gas station where you could buy soft shell crab sandwiches. This was special, we agreed; and now, late Sunday afternoon near the end of the road, we were also nearing the end of our weekend.</p>
        <p>A Seasonal Toast</p>
        <p>Lou and I decided to go back to St. Michaels for dinner, to 208 Talbot, the restaurant that Jeanie had told us was the source of her and her friends' high spirits the night we had arrived. We were assured that this was one of the best restaurants in the area, and that its reputation was deserved.</p>
        <p>We felt happy the moment we entered. The hostess welcomed us as if she had been waiting for our arrival. The room was beautiful and simple, with fresh flowers, candlelight and rustic wooden tables.</p>
        <p>We started with a fabulous oyster stew. Lou ordered pappardelle with spicy Italian sausage and a wild mushroom ragout. The waitress recommended the local specialty, a true harbinger of spring, shad roe. We may have been early for Maryland crabs and striped bass -- and late for the geese -- but we had inadvertently arrived at the perfect time for shad roe.</p>
        <p>Our waitress cautioned, however, that not everyone was fond of shad roe. ''I'll take that,'' I said. Never in my life have I received so much positive feedback for something as small as a restaurant order.</p>
        <p>Our waitress, another waitress and the hostess all came by to congratulate me on my sense of adventure. Even the wine steward approvingly poured us extra glasses of wine. When the shad roe arrived, the wine steward came by to compliment me again. ''Happy spring!'' he said.</p>
