        <p>The most beautiful European cloister I've ever experienced lies along the Hudson River, just south of the Bronx border. The Cloisters and I were introduced in early May of my 11th year, a season when the transplanted monastery gardens in Fort Tryon Park explode with color.</p>
        <p>Our sixth-grade class had studied the social, political and economic structure of medieval Europe with a thoroughness that years later could  carry us cold through college examinations. We had spent the interminable dark winter immersed in the Middle Ages, hardly raising our heads to see if the 15th century ever arrived.</p>
        <p>We passed our weekends assembling bulky scrapbooks, scavenging our parents' bookshelves, buying up secondhand magazines on 42nd Street. In gold and peacock watercolors, we painstakingly adorned with gothic lettering the individual compendiums of our year's work. Our ''medieval books'' were displayed for admiring parents in the school library with a seriousness and pomp matching that of the rare-book room at the British Museum.</p>
        <p>In May our class set out in a yellow school bus with bad shocks on a bumpy crusade up the Henry Hudson Parkway. The Cloisters wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art is more than a reproduction of a medieval microcosm that any come-lately millionaire could hope to construct in Arizona. Chapels and cloisters were transplanted stone by stone from monasteries scattered throughout Europe. On a site overlooking the New Jersey Palisades, they were rebuilt on the biggest hill in New York near the highest-numbered streets in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The perfect haven of beauty abloom with fragrant blossoms, the bubbling stone fountain in the center, the spring air limpid and the sunshine sending warm rays upon our shiny childhood hair -- it was my first aesthetic jolt.</p>
        <p>And I've kept trying to recapture that platonic essence of cloister ever since.</p>
        <p>In every European city I've run straight to every cloister mentioned in each footnote of my guidebook. Predictably, my expectations were forever higher than any mere human cloister could deliver.</p>
        <p>In high school I dragged hapless friends on the endless trip through upper Manhattan on the No. 4 bus. Finally it made a majestic sweep into the circular driveway of the Cloisters; we disembarked and forded the mental moat back to the Middle Ages. But my friends always remained bewildered; reality did not match my magical description. We hurtled noisily back downtown on the A train.</p>
        <p>I introduced my two little girls to the Cloisters in exactly the right spring season.</p>
        <p>Driving them in from the suburbs in my station wagon, I told them over my shoulder of my mystical class trip and the wondrous surprise that was awaiting them. But my little girls had never heard of troubadours or Eleanor of Aquitaine, of stained glass windows or illuminated manuscripts.</p>
        <p>They trailed blankly after me through the courtyards until their patience wore out and they started to beg for Good Humors and tug my arm toward the gift shop.</p>
        <p>Years later, I took my first daughter to the Cloisters on the last sunny weekend before she left for college. I suspect I wanted to take my parting from her by coming together to the womblike gardens nestling hidden and comforting inside fluted arches. She recognized the white unicorn, an old friend from the reproduction of the tapestry tacked up on our kitchen cupboard, and said with sparkling eyes that she would certainly come back in the spring to see the rose trees flower.</p>
        <p>But for her the spring was years still in the future.</p>
        <p>It is suddenly spring again, a spring when I feel leaden and pedestrian -- ages older than the springs of my Middle Ages. Among the mail filled with offers of things I do not want I find the bulletin of events from the Metropolitan Museum. One page near the back lists hours, activities and location of the Cloisters.  Tucked at the bottom is an unobtrusive photograph of a flowering cloister garden, almost begging to be overlooked.</p>
        <p>I feel myself again walking in the orderly line of sixth graders, holding hands, two by two, with the teacher at the head and a chaperoning mother at the rear, wearing a starched cotton dress tied at the waist, filing out from the cool vaulted halls into the brilliant sunshine of the Cuxa cloister.</p>
        <p>What need have I to be moved by the fairyland beauty of foreign castles along a foreign Rhine or to trudge with tourists through congested Florence, when right next to the prosaic Hudson looms our majestic medieval fortress controlling all of Manhattan Island? And along with Manhattan, holding my old heart within its walls, a more than willing captive.</p>
