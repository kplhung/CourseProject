        <p>Pound for pound, they are perhaps the toughest players in this roguish series that passes for playoff basketball. One talks the talk, verbally challenging referees and competitors and, if necessary, throwing right-left combinations at larger, more celebrated opponents on national television. The other studies his Bible daily, speaks in a slow monotone that suggests disinterest and carries himself humbly throughout the often egotistical atmosphere of the National Basketball Association.</p>
        <p>They are the Knicks' point guards, Charlie Ward and Chris Childs, and once again they are proving to be good enough to direct the Knicks through the Eastern Conference playoffs.</p>
        <p>They will never be Gary Payton, Terrell Brandon, Rod Strickland or any of the other elite point guards the Knicks' fans crave, but what they lack in outright ability is often compensated by hard-nosed doggedness.</p>
        <p>Ward and Childs typically take turns playing at the top of their games, and right now it is Ward who is shining. He was the hero of Game 2, recording 13 points and 6 rebounds to offset the poor shooting of Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston. And for the time being, his performance has put to rest the talk of his expendability.</p>
        <p>''Everybody's been trying to take me away from my job or trade me and all of those types of things,'' Ward said today. ''All my life I've been proving people wrong, so I don't get any satisfaction out of that. I get satisfaction out of praising the Lord and doing the best that I can to help my team win and supporting my family. What other people think of me is really not important.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks want to see more of that effort from Ward tonight in Game 3 at Madison Square Garden. The team's coaches have been badgering him to add the penetration that made him so effective in Game 2 to his standard repertory of diving, boxing out and hustling.</p>
        <p>''If Charlie is in attack mode, he's very effective,'' Don Chaney, an assistant coach, said. ''If he's not in the attack mode, then he's just Charlie. Sometimes, I think he feels that he has to get all of the other guys involved and not be as aggressive himself. We want our point guards to get everybody involved but at the same time we want him to also be aggressive and attack the basket.''</p>
        <p>What the Knicks' coaches love about Ward's periodic penetration is his fearlessness. Because of his football background, the threat of a hard foul does not scare him -- remember the hit he took from P. J. Brown in the 1997 playoffs. Tuesday, he scored on three driving layups, converting one into a 3-point play, in the first quarter.</p>
        <p>''A lot of guards go to the basket and shy away because they're afraid of getting hit,'' Chaney said. ''Charlie Ward loves to get hit, and he's one of the guys I know that finishes. He'll get a 3-point play because he stays in there.''</p>
        <p>Some observers thought Coach Jeff Van Gundy should have started Ward in the second quarter of Game 2 after his hot outing in the first quarter, but Van Gundy said he would not stray from his pattern of playing Ward in the first quarter and Childs in the second. But on Tuesday, Ward's two fouls made Van Gundy's decision easier. But Ward would have come out anyway.</p>
        <p>''In the first half, Chris'll come in at some point in the first or early in the second,'' Van Gundy said. ''Who finishes the half in either half depends on how the team's going or how they're playing.''</p>
        <p>Childs's aggressiveness usually shows up on the defensive end of the court, where he is known for being rugged on ball handlers. But in Game 2, he was a bit too overanxious, fouling out in 11 minutes. Childs's temper -- the one that led him to clock the Lakers' Kobe Bryant on national television last month and earn a two-game suspension -- got the best of him after his sixth foul, as he went on a verbal tirade because he thought Miami's Tim Hardaway had elbowed him.</p>
        <p>Realizing that a fourth-quarter technical foul could cost them a game in such a tightly-matched series, several Knicks tried to calm Childs down, and he wisely retreated to the locker room rather than fester at courtside. Childs understands the importance of remaining cool, but says he refuses to quell his fire.</p>
        <p>''I play with high intensity and I'm going to keep playing that way,'' Childs said. ''I'm not going to get a technical to put my teammates and my team in trouble. I've been in enough playoff games to know that those are costly and you don't need them. You just have to pick and choose the time to talk to the refs and then just let it go.</p>
        <p>''I didn't do that in Game 2, and it will be a different outcome in Game 3.''</p>
        <p>Van Gundy said he treasured Childs's court demeanor and would not ask him to change it.</p>
        <p>''Composure's important but so is aggression,'' Van Gundy said. ''You have to have talent to get in this league, but the reason Chris is able to stick in this league is intensity and aggressiveness. I'm not worried about Chris. He's going to complain to the officials until the day he is out of this league. I'll take a guy like Chris, a guy you know is coming ready every night playing to win that occasionally loses his temper, over a guy who's got everything under control and doesn't want to compete as hard. It's hard to find competitors.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks have two of them running the point.</p>
