        <p>* ''AMERICAN PSYCHO,'' starring Christian Bale. Directed by Mary Harron (R, 104 minutes). Ms. Harron's sleekly brilliant screen adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis's notorious 1991 novel pares away most of the book's gore to portray the main character's homicidal butchery as a high-gloss fantasy. The movie's chic blend of satire, comedy and horror is anchored in a star-making performance by Mr. Bale as Patrick Bateman, a fashion-obsessed late-80's Wall Street hotshot who goes on a killing spree. Reese Witherspoon, Chloe Sevigny, Samantha Mathis and Cara Seymour give dazzling cameo performances as the unfortunate women in his life. The movie's message about a soulless, surface-obsessed society still applies (Stephen Holden).</p>

        <p>* ''AMERICAN PSYCHO,'' starring Christian Bale. Directed by Mary Harron (R, 104 minutes). Ms. Harron's sleekly brilliant screen adaptation of Bret Easton Ellis's notorious 1991 novel pares away most of the book's gore to portray the main character's homicidal butchery as a high-gloss fantasy.

Reese Witherspoon, Chloe Sevigny, Samantha Mathis and Cara Seymour give dazzling cameo performances as the unfortunate women in his life. The movie's message about a soulless, surface-obsessed society still applies (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>* ''THE COLOR OF PARADISE,'' starring Mohsen Ramezani and Hossein Mahjur. Directed by Majid Majidi (PG, 90 minutes). This beautiful Iranian movie about a widowed father who is reluctant to care for his blind 8-year-old son is a heartbreaker done with such conviction that it avoids mawkishness. When the special school the boy has been attending won't keep him on, the father first takes his son to the family's woodland homestead, then leaves him in the care of a blind carpenter. The movie evokes nature with an ecstatic sensuousness, and its heady soundtrack teems with the sounds of birds, insects, wind and rain (Holden).</p>
        <p>* ''EAST-WEST,'' starring Sandrine Bonnaire, Oleg Menchikov and Catherine Deneuve. Directed by Regis Wargnier (PG-13, 115 minutes). After World War II the Soviet government undertook a propaganda campaign to entice Russians living in the West to return home. Aleksei Golovine (Mr. Menchikov) and his French wife, Marie (Ms. Bonnaire), the couple at the heart of Mr. Wargnier's sumptuous, moving historical melodrama, are luckier than most of their fellow returnees, who are killed or imprisoned on arrival. ''East-West'' chronicles Aleksei's ambivalence about their new life in a drab, depressing communal apartment and Marie's desperate attempts to escape it. The film may be faulted for dissolving the horrors of history in Hollywood-style catharsis, but it also uses the resources of old-fashioned emotionally emphatic filmmaking to shed light on forgotten history. ''East-West'' is a grand costume pageant, full of grandeur and period detail, but it is also the portrait of a marriage under extreme external and internal pressure, and a showcase for two great film actresses: Ms. Bonnaire and Ms. Deneuve, playing an actress who becomes aware of Marie's plight during a tour of the Soviet Union (A. O. Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''FREQUENCY,'' starring Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel. Directed by Gregory Hoblit (PG-13, 100 minutes). ''Back to the Future'' meets ''Field of Dreams'' meets ''It's a Wonderful Life'' meets ''The Sixth Sense'' in this entertaining but shamelessly sentimental supernatural soap opera with a macho heart. Mr. Caviezel is a morose young policeman who contacts his dead father, a heroic firefighter, on a ham radio and contrives to save him from the accident that cost him his life during the 1969 World Series. From here, the two collaborate on changing other aspects of the past and on catching a serial killer. There are enough testosterone tears to soak Shea Stadium (Holden).</p>
        <p>''GLADIATOR,'' starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix and Oliver Reed (R, 150 minutes). This movie is the answer to a question no one bothered to ask: What would happen if someone decided to film the imminent extreme football league as if it were a Chanel commercial? Mr. Scott subjects action-packed bouts of mayhem and decapitation in the Roman Colosseum to his glossy, inhuman directing style; it's admirable but repellent. Mr. Crowe is the noble Roman general who ends up fighting for his life. Mr. Crowe gives a performance with ball-of-fire intensity, suffused with a movie star's impatience. He holds the movie together, such as it is (Elvis Mitchell).</p>
        <p>* ''HIGH FIDELITY,'' starring John Cusack, Jill Peterson, Iben Hjejle and Joan Cusack. Directed by Stephen Frears (R, 107 minutes). Although its setting has been moved from London to Chicago, the screen adaptation of Nick Hornby's best-selling 1995 novel is wonderfully true to the spirit of the book. Mr. Cusack has one of his juiciest roles in Rob, a 30-something record store manager and vinyl fanatic sorting through the ''Top 5'' breakups in his disastrous romantic history while trying to salvage his latest relationship. The movie hilariously captures the mind-set of not-so-young men for whom pop music is a kind of religion and hip musical taste an ultimate measure of a person's worth (Holden).</p>
        <p>''I DREAMED OF AFRICA,'' starring Kim Basinger and Vincent Perez. Directed by Hugh Hudson (PG-13, 120 minutes). This screen adaptation of Kuki Gallmann's memoir about her life in Kenya with an adventurer husband and two children is little more than a  picturesque travelogue. Although the story is loaded with tragedy, a stiff, expository  screenplay and mostly weak performances keep it from resonating. Ms. Basinger's spaced-out baby-doll Kuki and Mr. Perez's petulant husband render this conservation-minded couple remote and vaguely unsympathetic. That couldn't have been the movie's intention (Holden).</p>
        <p>''KEEPING THE FAITH,'' starring Edward Norton, Ben Stiller and Jenna Elfman. Directed by Mr. Norton (PG-13, 129 minutes). Mr. Norton doubles as actor and director in this competent comedy with a premise that's both high concept and the punch line to a barroom joke: a priest (Mr. Norton) and a rabbi (Mr. Stiller) fall in love with a woman (Ms. Elfman) they've known since they were children. Mr. Norton wisely chose not to make himself the star. He places that burden on Mr. Stiller's shoulders, and both seem to be doing Woody Allen to compensate for the underwritten material (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''LOVE AND BASKETBALL,'' starring Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps. Directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood (PG-13, 118 minutes). The writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood's feature-film debut, about the romantic and competitive bond between the basketball players Monica (Ms. Lathan) and Quincy (Mr. Epps), has an enchanting, lived-in homeyness. Ms. Prince-Bythewood does a wonderful job of creating an atmosphere for her characters -- particularly for the superb Ms. Lathan -- but the movie fails to fashion a consistent narrative. It doesn't seem to be about anything. But it's a promising first movie from a filmmaker with a lot to offer. Who knew anyone could get a drama out of Title IX, the Federal law ensuring that girls get a chance to compete in high school sports? (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''RULES OF ENGAGEMENT,'' starring Tommy Lee Jones and Samuel L. Jackson. Directed by William Friedkin (R, 123 minutes). The two powerhouse actors muster all the technique they can bring to bear for this by-the-numbers courtroom drama with flashes of bruising action: it's like the world's most expensive episode of ''JAG,'' with bits of ''The Verdict'' mixed in for extra flavor. Mr. Jones plays a shaky, alcoholic Marine lawyer brought in to defend his fellow marine (Mr. Jackson) against charges of military misconduct. Since ''Rules'' makes it clear from the outset that Mr. Jackson's character is innocent, the only suspense comes from wondering whether Guy Pearce, as the prosecutor, will be able to maintain his bizarre accent (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>* ''TIME CODE,'' starring Jean Tripplehorn, Saffron Burrows, Holly Hunter and Stellan Skarsgard. Directed by Mike Figgis (R, 93 minutes). Mr. Figgis's astonishing new film, shot in a single day with hand-held digital video cameras, tells four stories simultaneously, in real time. ''Time Code'' is at once a mordant satire of the hypocrisy and self-delusion of the film industry and an earnest declaration of faith in the medium itself. In addition to its technical innovations, which test the limits of the human eye, ear and mind, the film boasts some brilliant improvisational acting from its enormous cast. Especially fine are Ms. Tripplehorn and Mr. Skarsgard, whose strongly emotional performances add a measure of pathos. Whether ''Time Code'' will ultimately be seen as a bold prophecy of the dawning visual age or as a passionate, gimmicky curio is for the future to decide. At present, though, it's hard to think of a more exciting demonstration of the inexhaustible possibilities of film (Scott).</p>
        <p>''28 DAYS,'' starring Sandra Bullock, Viggo Mortensen and Dominic West. Directed by Betty Thomas (PG-13, 110 minutes). Sandra Bullock gives a creditable performance as Gwen Cummings, a fun-loving New York writer ordered to visit a drug and alcohol rehabilitation clinic after a drunken car accident. Veering unsteadily between comedy and suds, the movie portrays Gwen's fellow residents at Serenity Glen as a bunch of goofy caricatures and confuses things further with its dime-store psychologizing. It ultimately reduces the rehab experience to a zany (but mostly unfunny) summer-camp farce (Holden).</p>
        <p>''U-571,'' starring Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton and Harvey Keitel. Directed by Jonathan Mostow (PG-13, 120 minutes). Mr. Mostow, whose previous film, ''Breakdown,'' was a marvel of B-picture minimalism, shifts from the wide-open spaces to the cramped interior of a World War II submarine movie. Mr. McConaughey, whose knotted-with-unease face makes it look as if he's cramming for finals, is part of a secret mission to capture a Nazi code-encryption machine and get it back to the Allies. He and his crew have to do so on a Nazi U-boat they have hijacked. Mr. Mostow does a fine job of building tension, given that he's working in a minor genre whose climactic notes you'll know if you've ever seen a movie set on a sub (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''THE VIRGIN SUICIDES,'' starring Kirsten Dunst, James Woods and Kathleen Turner. Directed by Sofia Coppola (R, 97 minutes). Ms. Coppola's directorial debut, adapted from Jeffrey Eugenides's 1993 novel about the self-destruction of five sisters in a 1970's Michigan suburb, shows her to be a filmmaker with fine visual and emotional instincts, adept at matching the book's hypnotic, sensual black humor. The movie's best moments have an inspired feeling of playfulness and freedom matched by Ms. Dunst's smart, beguiling performance as Lux Lisbon, whose sexual awakening propels her and her sisters to their doom. But despite Ms. Coppola's keen instincts, and the beautifully understated acting of Mr. Woods and Ms. Turner as the Lisbon parents, ''The Virgin Suicides'' is marred by the self-conscious aestheticism and emotional detachment of its source (Scott).</p>
        <p>''WHERE THE HEART IS,'' starring Natalie Portman and Ashley Judd. Directed by Matt Williams (PG-13, 115 minutes). Young Novalee Nation (Ms. Portman) is terribly phobic about the number five, and about five minutes into this astonishingly shameless melodrama with its lower-class sweetheart heroine, you'll start to feel exactly the same way. The movie seems to be stuck with its own five fixation, too, because a new character or situation is introduced every five minutes, or so it feels, to keep things lively. Abandoned by her boyfriend, Novalee gives birth in a Wal-Mart. She later befriends a nurse (Ms. Judd), a single mom with a passel of children, and takes up photography. The audience doesn't get credit for being able to track a character through life without the film's being stuffed with enough nutty incidents -- a kidnapping, catastrophic storms -- for an entire season of television (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>Film Series</p>
        <p>''JEAN ARTHUR: FROM THE ARCHIVES.''  George Stevens called her ''one of the greatest comediennes the screen has ever seen,'' and Frank Capra called her ''my favorite actress.'' Her real name was Gladys Georgianna Greene, but movie fans knew her as Jean Arthur. She made her movie debut in 1923 in a bit role in John Ford's ''Cameo Kirby,'' but it was not until the mid-30's that she became a star, notable for her distinctive husky voice, her down-to-earth personality and her vivacity. Beginning tomorrow, Jean Arthur will be the subject of a homage at the Museum of Modern Art. The series includes three Stevens films, including her last, the 1953 western ''Shane.'' The opening attraction, at 2 p.m. tomorrow, is ''The Talk of the Town,'' the  1942 Stevens comedy in which Arthur played a landlady whose academic boarder (Ronald Colman) shelters an innocent friend (Cary Grant) fleeing a murder charge. At 5 p.m. tomorrow, the attraction is ''The More the Merrier,'' the 1943 Stevens comedy with Joel McCrea and Charles Coburn that earned Arthur an Academy Award nomination for her portrayal of a proper young lady dealing with the apartment shortage in World War II Washington. Continuing through May 18 at the Museum of Modern Art, 11 West 53rd Street, Manhattan, the series is free with museum admission: $10 for adults, $6.50 for students and people 65 or older; free for visitors under 16 accompanied by an adult. Pay what you wish on Fridays from 4:30 to 8:15 p.m. Screening information: (212) 708-9400 (Lawrence Van Gelder).</p>
