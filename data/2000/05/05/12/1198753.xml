        <p>As much as some people would like to regard boxing as nothing more than a brute contest of physical endurance, the sport also has its spiritual side. The importance of attitude -- of psyching yourself up and psyching out your opponent, of maintaining a feeling of emotional and physical self-mastery under extreme stress -- is almost as crucial to winning as physical strength and agility. That point is brought home again and again in ''Shadow Boxers,'' Katya Bankowsky's upbeat documentary portrait of women's boxing, a sport that has only recently begun to be taken seriously by promoters.</p>
        <p>Much of the movie, which opens today at Cinema Village, focuses on Lucia Rijker, the Dutch prizefighter who is the closest thing to a superstar in women's boxing. In and out of the ring, Ms. Rijker exudes a take-charge charisma and calm self-containment that recall the imperturbable solidity of a star like Queen Latifah. Determined and relentless in the ring, Ms. Rijker, a Buddhist chanter, is a wonder to watch as she maneuvers with a ferocity that seems unaffected by any mood  swings.</p>

        <p>As much as some people would like to regard boxing as nothing more than a brute contest of physical endurance, the sport also has its spiritual side. The importance of attitude -- of psyching yourself up and psyching out your opponent, of maintaining a feeling of emotional and physical self-mastery under extreme stress -- is almost as crucial to winning as physical strength and agility. That point is brought home again and again in ''Shadow Boxers,'' Katya Bankowsky's upbeat documentary portrait of women's boxing, a sport that has only recently begun to be taken seriously by promoters.</p>
        <p>Much of the movie, which opens today at Cinema Village, focuses on Lucia Rijker, the Dutch prizefighter who is the closest thing to a superstar in women's boxing. In and out of the ring, Ms. Rijker exudes a take-charge charisma and calm self-containment that recall the imperturbable solidity of a star like Queen Latifah. Determined and relentless in the ring, Ms. Rijker, a Buddhist chanter, is a wonder to watch as she maneuvers with a ferocity that seems unaffected by any mood  swings.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rijker, who was born in Amsterdam of mixed racial parentage, was a teenage kickboxing champion before she took up regular boxing. In 1994 she moved to Los Angeles to go professional and was pursued by several promoters, including Don King and Bob Arum. (She ended up signing with Mr. Arum as his first female fighter.) Since 1997 she has held the title of women's super lightweight boxing champion of the world.</p>
        <p>Discussing the joys and stresses of boxing, Ms. Rijker is more articulate than most fighters. The training process, she says, is an intensely isolating experience because of the concentration on self. That may explain why the movie offers no glimpses into her personal life, although she does mention that she would one day like to have a family.</p>
        <p>We also see her fitting in comfortably at an otherwise all-male training camp. Here, she doesn't strain to be one of the boys or insist on attending their raucous all-night parties, at which she describes her fellow trainees as behaving like ''eight animals.''</p>
        <p>For Ms. Rijker, isolation breeds self-knowledge. Boxing, she says, forces her to go to scary psychological places she would normally never visit and to confront her deepest  fears. She is also aware of how short-lived a profession it can be: she  keeps a picture of herself as a baby beside a portrait of a fighter who died in the ring to remind herself of the risk of remaining in the sport for too many years.</p>
        <p>The movie's portrait of Ms. Rijker is wound around a cursory survey of women's boxing, which the Golden Gloves didn't recognize until 1995. Ms. Rijker's professional career is contrasted with that of Jill Matthews, a Golden Gloves flyweight who jokes that she prepared for her championship bout with ''a manicure and a pedicure.'' Ms. Matthews's vision of the personal rewards of boxing closely parallels Ms. Rijker's. For both women, it is a profoundly self-empowering sport in which winning can be so heady that they recognize its addictive potential. But for women, winning isn't really a triumph of muscle power as it is of self-discipline or as Ms. Matthews tersely phrases it, ''of mind over matter.''</p>
