        <p>American Ballet Theater began Tuesday night at the Metropolitan Opera House with crystalline dancing in a George Balanchine classic and continued with appropriately moody dancing in a signature work by Antony Tudor. But the evening caught fire when two comfortably familiar old pros, Susan Jaffe and Julio Bocca, danced a little occasion piece by Jerome Robbins.</p>
        <p>The occasion for Robbins's ''Other Dances'' in 1976 was primarily the matching of Natalia Makarova and Mikhail Baryshnikov in a gala pas de deux. Set to piano music by Chopin performed onstage, ''Other Dances'' is American froufrou that allows seasoned dancers a chance at subtle frolic.</p>

        <p>American Ballet Theater began Tuesday night at the Metropolitan Opera House with crystalline dancing in a George Balanchine classic and continued with appropriately moody dancing in a signature work by Antony Tudor. But the evening caught fire when two comfortably familiar old pros, Susan Jaffe and Julio Bocca, danced a little occasion piece by Jerome Robbins.</p>
        <p>The occasion for Robbins's ''Other Dances'' in 1976 was primarily the matching of Natalia Makarova and Mikhail Baryshnikov in a gala pas de deux. Set to piano music by Chopin performed onstage, ''Other Dances'' is American froufrou that allows seasoned dancers a chance at subtle frolic.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jaffe and Mr. Bocca danced with an easy authority that no one else on the program quite matched. They managed to color and heighten the choreography without overwhelming it, with Mr. Bocca adding an extra degree of sly humor through a well-timed gaze or two. The musicality of their phrasing was another pleasure, in a performance made even more compelling by David LaMarche's sympathetic musical support.</p>
        <p>Like Robbins, Tudor was a choreographic pillar of Ballet Theater in its early years. Tudor's ''Jardin aux Lilas'' (''Lilac Garden'') was performed by the company in its first season, in January 1940, and since then the ballet has been a staple of the repertory. The revival performed on Tuesday night, staged by the great Tudor interpreter Sallie Wilson, suggested both the gifts and the pitfalls of Tudor's style for dancers today.</p>
        <p>Unlike Robbins, whose narrative ballets can be performed with either naturalistic or stylish acting, Tudor created works that generally demand the stylized projection of profound emotion through the dancing alone. In ''Jardin aux Lilas,'' the curved, raised arms of the ensemble dancers communicate the bittersweet atmosphere of an Edwardian garden party on a lilac-scented night. The sudden turn of a head or crook of an arm can suggest fairly complex psychological detail, from the refusal of a pillar of society to acknowledge his mistress to the resignation of his young fiancee, Caroline, as she is forced to leave her dashing lover for an arranged marriage.</p>
        <p>Only Robert Hill struck the right balance of searing detail and relatively cool stylization, turning the role of the Man She Must Marry into a troubling portrayal of a controlling man who boils with suppressed rage. Julie Kent had immensely touching moments as Caroline, though her handshake with the mistress looked anachronistic. Now Ms. Kent must make the portrait larger and bolder. Maxim Belotserkovsky's depiction of Her Lover was elegantly finished as classical dancing, but the character, like Sandra Brown's Episode in His Past, remained a cipher dramatically. Ron Oakland was the fine solo violinist in the lilac-drenched Chausson score.</p>
        <p>The program opened with a performance, led by Paloma Herrera and Angel Corella, that captured the steely delicacy and handsome overarching patterns of Balanchine's ''Theme and Variations.'' The closing ballet was Twyla Tharp's new ''Variations on a Theme by Haydn.'' Ermanno Florio was the evening's conductor.</p>
