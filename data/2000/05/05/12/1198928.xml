        <p>Through tomorrow</p>
        <p>If a midpoint exists between the work of Odd Nerdrum and that of John Currin and Lisa Yuskavage, Elizabeth Olbert's latest paintings may be it. They reiterate some of contemporary painting's hottest tics: images of vulnerable grotesques pit paint-as-paint against a distorted realism, with asides to both art history and popular culture. But they also exude a melodramatic, conservative obviousness that ultimately talks down to the viewer.</p>
        <p>The disparate elements of Ms. Olbert's painting are initially intriguing and seductive, if only for the skill of execution. With their pale translucent skin, her mutant gargoyles are creepily real and ambiguous: transsexual, transracial, even transspecies. These creatures exist in a viscous atmosphere adrift with painterly molecules: pastel dots, jaundiced wave patterns, Klimt-like facets.</p>

        <p>If a midpoint exists between the work of Odd Nerdrum and that of John Currin and Lisa Yuskavage, Elizabeth Olbert's latest paintings may be it. They reiterate some of contemporary painting's hottest tics: images of vulnerable grotesques pit paint-as-paint against a distorted realism, with asides to both art history and popular culture. But they also exude a melodramatic, conservative obviousness that ultimately talks down to the viewer.</p>
        <p>The disparate elements of Ms. Olbert's painting are initially intriguing and seductive, if only for the skill of execution. With their pale translucent skin, her mutant gargoyles are creepily real and ambiguous: transsexual, transracial, even transspecies. These creatures exist in a viscous atmosphere adrift with painterly molecules: pastel dots, jaundiced wave patterns, Klimt-like facets.</p>
        <p>The molecules also attach themselves to the faces, forming scatterings of jewel-like liver spots, bizarre stubble or scales. The mottled forehead of the creature in ''Johnny Angel'' suggests that he might grow up to have the grotesquely furrowed brow of a ''Star Trek'' Klingon.</p>
        <p>Ms. Olbert seems to be after some fusion of the decorative and the corporeal, or perhaps of the skin of painting with the skin of the body. But her dualities are too familiar to coalesce into something original. And her images never convince the viewer that this ambition aims much higher than Hollywood special effects in the first place.</p>
