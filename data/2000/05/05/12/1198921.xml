        <p>'A Life in Art'</p>
        <p>AXA Gallery</p>
        <p>787 Seventh Avenue, at 51st Street</p>
        <p>Through May 27</p>
        <p>An intimate, domestic painter convinced that the best kind of art lay in closely observed reality, Fairfield Porter (1907-1975) still showed in his work an abstract sensibility. To his paintings of people, still lifes, household interiors and landscapes, he brought not only the intimism of French artists like Bonnard and Vuillard, but also flat painterly areas of color and gesture that have more than a passing relationship to the nonrealist work of his peers.</p>
        <p>This display of more than 40 paintings, watercolors and drawings was organized by Justin Spring, author of the recent biography, ''Fairfield Porter: A Life in Art.'' The show makes a visual autobiography, tracking Porter's life through his depictions of family, friends and immediate surroundings in Southampton, on Long Island, and in Great Spruce Head Island, Me., his winter and summer homes. In fact, most of Porter's art, lively and intimate yet cool in its approach, is inseparable from his autobiography.</p>

        <p>'A Life in Art'</p>

        <p>An intimate, domestic painter convinced that the best kind of art lay in closely observed reality, Fairfield Porter (1907-1975) still showed in his work an abstract sensibility. To his paintings of people, still lifes, household interiors and landscapes, he brought not only the intimism of French artists like Bonnard and Vuillard, but also flat painterly areas of color and gesture that have more than a passing relationship to the nonrealist work of his peers.</p>
        <p>This display of more than 40 paintings, watercolors and drawings was organized by Justin Spring, author of the recent biography, ''Fairfield Porter: A Life in Art.'' The show makes a visual autobiography, tracking Porter's life through his depictions of family, friends and immediate surroundings in Southampton, on Long Island, and in Great Spruce Head Island, Me., his winter and summer homes. In fact, most of Porter's art, lively and intimate yet cool in its approach, is inseparable from his autobiography.</p>
        <p>His human subjects -- among them his wife, Anne; his five children; himself; and friends -- are often placed in highly specific settings, like ''Laurence at the Piano'' (1953), in which his teenage son sits absorbed in his playing before a view of the living room and dining room doorway of the Southampton house. A broad swath of ocher defines the floor and a band of orange the living room carpet. ''The Mirror'' (1966), inspired by Velazquez, shows Porter's young daughter Lizzie, dressed in bright red, seated before a mirror that places her in her father's studio, where he stands in ghostly remoteness, holding a brush near a window conveying a pale outdoor scene.</p>
        <p>In his last years Porter turned more to nature and the environment, producing distilled ''scapes'' like ''A Sudden Change of Wind'' (1973), a near-abstract view of the ocean at Southampton as roiled, shifting waves break on the beach, with an ominous band of black, whitecapped water in the middle.</p>
        <p>The show -- complete with memorabilia, samples of Porter's insightful critical writings, and comic relief like a spoofy film of the Porter menage by Rudy Burckhardt -- gives a good account of Porter's achievement in making his quiet, deep domestic perceptions as viable as the charged dynamics of Abstract Expressionism.</p>
