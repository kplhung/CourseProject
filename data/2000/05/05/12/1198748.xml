        <p>Alan Ball was talking about his idea for a movie the other day. ''Can you imagine pitching this?'' he asked. ''Two families, really screwed up. You think you know what's going on, but it's really something different because actually the movie is about the elusive nature of reality, and there's a whole metaphysical bit with this plastic bag.''</p>
        <p>The film, ''American Beauty,'' was Mr. Ball's first movie script. It didn't seem to be Hollywood's cup of tea. ''I thought, 'If it ever gets made, it will be for $12,' '' he said. But Steven Spielberg liked what he read, and his studio, DreamWorks, bought it. Five Academy Awards later, one of them for Mr. Ball as best screenwriter, the film has been released on videocassette.</p>

        <p>Alan Ball was talking about his idea for a movie the other day. ''Can you imagine pitching this?'' he asked. ''Two families, really screwed up. You think you know what's going on, but it's really something different because actually the movie is about the elusive nature of reality, and there's a whole metaphysical bit with this plastic bag.''</p>
        <p>The film, ''American Beauty,'' was Mr. Ball's first movie script. It didn't seem to be Hollywood's cup of tea. ''I thought, 'If it ever gets made, it will be for $12,' '' he said. But Steven Spielberg liked what he read, and his studio, DreamWorks, bought it. Five Academy Awards later, one of them for Mr. Ball as best screenwriter, the film has been released on videocassette.</p>
        <p>Now that it is on tape, what is there new to notice? ''I've seen it 20 times,'' Mr. Ball said. ''I see little continuity glitches, but I also see things in the performances I didn't see the first 19 times.'' He mentioned the subtlety of Thora Birch's performance as the mutinous teenage daughter of Lester and Carolyn Burnham (Kevin Spacey and Annette Bening) and the many layers Chris Cooper gave Colonel Fitts, the Burnhams' spectacularly troubled neighbor.</p>
        <p>On video, one is again struck by the film's clean structure and bright look, which sets off the darkness of the material. Mr. Ball and Sam Mendes, the director, made a commentary for the DVD, which hasn't been released or scheduled. ''Sam explains how at the beginning of the film everything is a little darker, and as Lester opens up and starts having a new life, there's more light,'' Mr. Ball said.</p>
        <p>At first he did not like the idea that DreamWorks would be making his film. ''I said no because they'd turn it into something big and bloated and weird,'' he said. ''But then they convinced me that they wouldn't. And they didn't.''</p>
        <p>The Long Road</p>
        <p>Like ''American Beauty,'' other films with Spielberg connections are taking their time coming to DVD. The next arrival will be ''Jaws,'' to be issued on disc by Universal on July 11 and now No. 4 on Video Business magazine's list of the biggest movies still missing on DVD.</p>
        <p>Not all of them are Mr. Spielberg's; it only seems that way. At the top are the ''Star Wars'' films, which now include ''Episode I: The Phantom Menace,'' from Fox. No reason is given for their absence, but release decisions lie with their creator, George Lucas. Next come the ''Godfather'' films. No blaming Mr. Spielberg here, either. Distributors say the delay is caused by their director, Francis Ford Coppola.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spielberg's approval is needed for the Indiana Jones films, No. 3 as a group, as it is for ''Jurassic Park,'' No. 5 after ''Jaws.'' He directed them all. From there the list fans out: ''Dr. Zhivago,'' ''The Sound of Music,'' the three ''Back to the Future'' films (also controlled by Mr. Spielberg), ''Ben-Hur,'' the four ''Superman'' movies starring Christopher Reeve, ''Lawrence of Arabia,'' ''Saturday Night Live,'' ''Grease'' and ''Touch of Evil.''</p>
