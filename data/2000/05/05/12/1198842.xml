        <p>The moment was three years in the planning for Carol Fazio, the nurse manager at the Kings Highway Division of the Beth Israel Medical Center.

        <p>The moment was three years in the planning for Carol Fazio, the nurse manager at the Kings Highway Division of the Beth Israel Medical Center. To celebrate, she passed out tiny plastic Rollerblade keychains from a paper bag. ''It's nurse appreciation day,'' she joked. ''I bought you a new E.R.''</p>
        <p>''Roller skates? We need more than roller skates,'' retorted James Quitoni, a nurse at the hospital for 27 years, affixing one to his badge.</p>
        <p>Their giddiness belied the hours of serious preparation for that morning's task: they were going to move a whole emergency room to a new building, all the while keeping it fully operational, ready to handle whatever medical disaster might arise.</p>
        <p>The move of the emergency room from its cramped quarters represents a major change  for the small hospital in Midwood, Brooklyn. Where once 10 beds were squeezed into 2,500 square feet, with enough room for either a nurse or a visitor, but not both, now 16 beds were arranged racetrack-style around 8,000 square feet in a new adult care pavilion. That way, each bed could be monitored from the nurse's station.</p>
        <p>The new facility was promised when Beth Israel Medical Center bought the hospital, which serves about 25,000 people a year, in 1995.</p>
        <p>But before the luxury could be enjoyed, there were patients to worry about and new surroundings to get used to. Maureen Keeler, a nurse who had worked in the same emergency room for 17 years, nervously surveyed the rows of newly stocked storage cabinets.</p>
        <p>''You know how when you're cooking, you're used to the pots being in one closet?'' she said. ''Suddenly, they're in another closet. When you have to do things quickly, sometimes it's hard to make the transition.''</p>
        <p>As it turned out, it would not be that difficult. In fact, it was downright anticlimactic.</p>
        <p>''Don't get too excited; he doesn't have a heart problem,'' said Kathy Orsi, as she nonchalantly wheeled in the first patient, Joshua Einhorn, 15. He had checked in at the old emergency room the night before.</p>
        <p>''He's worried about his hair,'' she said as a photographer snapped his picture, ''and his appendix is coming out in an hour.''</p>
        <p>John Byrne, the vice president of administration, unlocked the waiting room's automatic doors, which satisfied the requirements of the Americans With Disabilities Act, but not the Sabbath rules of many Orthodox Jews, who are forbidden to use anything mechanized on Saturdays. Asked if someone could simply open the doors for observant Jews, Mr. Byrne replied, ''We're getting a ruling on that.''</p>
        <p>Upstairs in the new intensive care unit, Margaret Trepinian, 67, put her boss, Patricia Lekowski, in one of the new $17,000 beds, which weigh patients; fold into an upright, chairlike position; and sound an alarm if a patient starts to slide off. She pushed the Code Blue button, a new feature that would alert the entire ward in an emergency.</p>
        <p>''Right now, if I need help I have to go out and say, 'Mary Ann!' '' Mrs. Trepinian said.</p>
        <p>Because 211 of the hospital's 212 beds were already filled, ambulances had been diverted to other hospitals since midnight.</p>
        <p>Still, there were walk-in patients, most of them easily cared for. The first had an eye allergy. Another had a fever. Still another had cut a hand while opening a can of cat food.</p>
        <p>At 7:45 a.m., the first ambulance came: a woman with emphysema, discharged the day before, had asked to come back.</p>
        <p>The move of the intensive care patients began at 8 a.m., under Mrs. Trepinian's watchful eye. The first patient was detached from his life support systems and attached to a portable monitor. Ella Moore, a nurse, became a human ventilator, rhythmically squeezing a purple plastic bulb as the bed rolled down the hall.</p>
        <p>A team of nurses sorted through a tangle of tubes and wires and, on the count of three, lifted the man to his new bed. Before she returned to the old I.C.U. to start on the second patient, Ms. Moore had reassuring words. ''Give me until 4 o'clock, Mrs. T. I promise you they will all be there,'' she said in a Russian accent, with a hint of a laugh. ''Alive, also.''</p>
