        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>McCAIN RESPONDS TO SUPPORTERS ABOUT BUSH -- Supporters of Senator John McCain of Arizona are inundating him with hundreds of e-mail messages and telephone calls complaining about his endorsement of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. He has responded with an e-mail message of his own, sent to 120,000 supporters on his campaign list, that recalled that he had promised at the start of his campaign to support the eventual Republican nominee and that he always makes good on his promises. In any event, the message continued, Mr. Bush is now ''our best hope'' to oust the Democrats from the White House. ''To those who I have disappointed,'' Mr. McCain wrote, ''let me simply reiterate that I will never give up my fight for real government reform.'' He and the Texas governor, he said, still have ''a few principled disagreements,'' but he did not elaborate. McCain aides said the senator expected complaints about his endorsement but went ahead because breaking a promise would not only have tarnished his straight-talking image but also have made him appear a poor loser and a less-than-faithful Republican, should he ever seek the presidency again.</p>

        <p>BUSH COMMENTS ON 2 POSSIBLE RUNNING MATES -- When Gov. George W. Bush of Texas was asked about vice-presidential candidates in an interview with the Lifetime women's cable channel yesterday, he had notably different reactions to two names, suggesting that he was concerned about appearing too open to the idea of a running mate who strongly supports abortion rights. Asked if Elizabeth Dole, an opponent of abortion, was on his list, he said that she was and then praised her as ''a good friend of mine who has had a great career.'' But when asked about Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey, who supports abortion rights and whose selection would undoubtedly provoke many religious conservatives, Mr. Bush's response seemed conspicuously restrained. ''There's a lot of people on the list,'' he said.</p>

        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>ANOTHER SURVEY SHOWS A STRONG BUSH LEAD -- For the second time this week, a national presidential preference poll has Gov. George W. Bush leading Vice President Al Gore by at least half a dozen percentage points. The newest survey, released yesterday by the Voter.com group, puts Mr. Bush ahead by 48 percent to 42 percent. A poll released on Wednesday by The Los Angeles Times had Mr. Bush ahead by eight percentage points. Like the Times poll, the Voter.com poll found Mr. Bush now pulling about as much of the female vote as Mr. Gore, though that voting segment has traditionally leaned heavily to Democrats. Mr. Bush continues to lead among men, and he has moved ahead in the struggle for independents, a toss-up earlier. The Voter.com poll also found Mr. Bush leading among Democrats who had supported Ronald Reagan and also found that half of all voters had grown pessimistic about the state of the nation and its direction, despite the strong economy. Asked to rank top issues for Congress, voters most often mentioned ''restoring moral values,'' followed by education. They said Republicans would be best at restoring moral values -- 6 in 10 disapproved of President Clinton ''as a person'' -- but believed Democrats would do more for education. The poll surveyed 1,000 likely voters from May 1 to May 3 and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>GORE MAKES MOST OF WASHINGTON CONNECTIONS -- Many are the perks of being vice president, particularly when you are running for president. Al Gore demonstrated that anew this week, first by handing out what his office called ''deliverables'' -- more than $25 million in grants to expand tourism and businesses in the financially struggling Mississippi Delta -- and then by announcing ''improvements'' in veterans' education benefits worth $1.2 billion over five years. (Never mind that the money will come from savings in other veterans' programs.) Mr. Gore boasted that the improvements were ''the single largest increase in veterans' education benefits'' in more than 15 years. Gov. George W. Bush called Mr. Gore hypocritical because the Clinton administration had earlier proposed sharp cuts in veterans' benefits.</p>
