        <p>Derek Jeter had been struggling at the plate. So when the rains hit Wednesday night and postponed the game against the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, Jeter retreated to the batting cages and took two extra practice sessions in hopes of finding the route out of his slump.</p>
        <p>Instead he found pain. As a result of the workout, Jeter strained an abdominal muscle in his left side. He was sore before he started last night's game at Yankee Stadium, and Manager Joe Torre was on alert for a quick hook.</p>
        <p>It did not take long. Jeter left after the top of the second inning of the Yankees' 1-0 loss to the Devil Rays, having aggravated the muscle during his first at-bat, when he flied out to right field. The Yankee shortstop will miss the three-day weekend series against the Tigers in Detroit, after which the Yankees will determine if they will put him on the disabled list.</p>
        <p>''You do what you can,'' Torre said. ''You're not going to replace Derek Jeter with Derek Jeter. We'll just have to find a way to win without him.''</p>
        <p>That did not happen last night, as Tampa Bay's Steve Trachsel (3-2), who pitched a complete-game shutout in a 1-0 victory over Pedro Martinez and the Red Sox in Boston last Saturday, threw seven shutout innings against the Yankees. The reliever Albie Lopez earned the save with two shutout innings.</p>
        <p>They ruined an outstanding complete-game effort from Orlando Hernandez (4-2), who rebounded remarkably from three shaky outings but took the loss. His only mistake was a flat 2-1 fastball that Fred McGriff sent over the wall in right-center field in the seventh inning.</p>
        <p>But it was the fly ball in the first inning, off the beleaguered bat of Jeter, that set the tone for the game.</p>
        <p>''When I flew out, I felt a sharp pain,'' said Jeter, his ribs wrapped in a bulky bandage that also held chunks of ice. Nonetheless, Jeter returned to the field for the top of the second inning.</p>
        <p>With one out, he broke to his right on a Vinny Castilla grounder headed to the hole. The ball had already eluded third baseman Scott Brosius, but Jeter backed him up, gathered it, leapt, spun and threw across his body to force out Jose Canseco at second base.</p>
        <p>When the inning ended, Jeter walked into the clubhouse and Torre followed. ''I knew something was wrong when I saw that,'' catcher Jorge Posada said.</p>
        <p>Something had already been wrong, as Jeter had gone without a hit in three straight games, and had only five hits in his last 33 at-bats, including last night's flyout. ''Obviously, you work hard to correct things,'' Jeter said. ''This is the last thing I wanted to do. I can't correct anything on the bench.'' He does not like the option of the disabled list.</p>
        <p>''If it were up to me, of course I would not go on it,'' he said. ''But it's a tricky situation. You play too soon with it and you could miss more games.''</p>
        <p>Jeter has had a similar injury to his abdominal muscle, but on the opposite side. He injured it on a checked swing and was placed on the disabled list on June 4, 1998, and missed the next 12 games. Putting him on the D.L. would be a blow to the Yankees, who have played just seven games all year with their regular defensive lineup.</p>
        <p>''This team has had the ability to just make do with the lineup,'' said Brosius, who missed 17 games with a strained rib cage.</p>
        <p>Said Posada: ''Maybe this is good for him. He can relax a little bit. He should heal quickly.</p>
        <p>''It's tough not to see him in the lineup. We're going to miss him.''</p>
        <p>Last night the Yankees were befuddled by Trachsel, the same pitcher who lost 18 games last year with the Chicago Cubs. Hernandez was masterly as well, rarely getting behind batters and striking out six. ''As you can tell, the last couple of outings, I struggled with my control,'' Hernandez said through an interpreter. ''I was pretty happy with how I pitched.''</p>
        <p>Except for the one pitch that did not move to McGriff.</p>
        <p>Before and after his home run, the Yankees had chances to score. Clay Bellinger, who hit a home run Monday, came in as a defensive replacement for Jeter. He nearly cleared the left-field wall last night in the sixth inning. But Greg Vaughn snared it at the top of the fence and Chuck Knoblauch, who had doubled, scrambled back to second base. Paul O'Neill singled with two out, but Bernie Williams ended the scoring chance and the inning by grounding out.</p>
        <p>The Yankees also had a promising opportunity in the ninth, when O'Neill opened the inning with a single. But Williams flied out, Tino Martinez lined out to second and Posada, the hottest player on the team, hit a routine grounder to end the game.</p>
        <p>The game had an unfortunate outcome for the Yankees, but the pall had already been cast. Jeter is not replaceable, Torre said. ''We're just going to have to get the kind of pitching we got tonight,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Posada put it this way: ''It's early in the season. If we miss him in September, that's different.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Because of the rainout on Wednesday, the Yankees altered their rotation by moving their fifth starter, RAMIRO MENDOZA, to the bullpen, but he was not available last night because of soreness in his right (pitching) shoulder. Manager JOE TORRE said that the injury was not serious and that he would be available to pitch tonight in the opener of a three-game series at Detroit.</p>
