        <p>The works-on-paper group show ''Line,'' organized by Renee Riccardo, is a collaboration between two veteran Brooklyn galleries that have decided to join forces. It's also an attractive heads-up on some recent tendencies -- decorative is an umbrella word sometimes used -- in abstract painting.</p>
        <p>Arena has been exploring this turf from some time and gave solo debuts to several artists in ''Line'' who later established reputations in Manhattan. They include Chuck Agro, Joanne Greenbaum, Giles Lyon, Paul Henry Ramirez and Calvin Seibert. (The latter winningly turns fruit-colored organic shapes -- they look like papayas and avocados -- into space stations.)</p>

        <p>Eyewash</p>
        <p>143 North Seventh Street</p>

        <p>Through May 22</p>
        <p>The works-on-paper group show ''Line,'' organized by Renee Riccardo, is a collaboration between two veteran Brooklyn galleries that have decided to join forces. It's also an attractive heads-up on some recent tendencies -- decorative is an umbrella word sometimes used -- in abstract painting.</p>
        <p>Arena has been exploring this turf from some time and gave solo debuts to several artists in ''Line'' who later established reputations in Manhattan. They include Chuck Agro, Joanne Greenbaum, Giles Lyon, Paul Henry Ramirez and Calvin Seibert. (The latter winningly turns fruit-colored organic shapes -- they look like papayas and avocados -- into space stations.)</p>
        <p>Of particular interest on this occasion are their less familiar colleagues. Several of them work in an incremental, connect-the-dots mode. Eric Hongisto -- who, like other artists here, also works in an installation format -- deploys clusters of colored orbs over pale color grounds. Matthew Deleget threads strings of silver hyphens across a black ground to create a kind of radiant, handmade Minimalism, at once rigorous and personable.</p>
        <p>Patterning in Conrad Kwiatkow ski's watercolors takes the form of allover whorled, petal-like fragments. The artist named Vargas-Suarez Universal surrounds spare geometric structures with eddying currents of blue ballpoint pen strokes. His attention to linear movement finds an echo in Erick Johnson's Brice Mardenish gouache skeins.</p>
        <p>Many of these elements come together in the color-pencil drawings of Cotter Luppi, whose immaculately rendered forms suggest DNA chains, Hindu gods and cartoons, all done in the soft pink-browns of Indian sandstone. The work look both highly polished and promising.</p>
        <p>Mr. Luppi has one foot in a figurative realm already occupied by Angela Wyman's images of bare legs and flouncy skirts. A larger selection of Ms. Wyman's paintings can be found in a three-person show at Eyewash, where she shares space with oil-on-panel interiors by Lori Taschler (who first showed in the East Village in the 1980's) and assemblages of brooches, buttons and dressmakers' pom-poms by Jeanne Tremel.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tremel's work gives the omnipresent painted dot a sculptural presence. And the Williamsburg sampler, supplemented by a sparkling show of intense, embroidery-like paintings by Steve Di Benedetto on view at Baumgartner Galleries in Chelsea through May 27, confirms yet again that the decorative is, at its best, a source of serious pleasure in art at the moment.</p>
