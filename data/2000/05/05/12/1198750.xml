        <p>Rockefeller Center is famous for the 100-foot Christmas tree it installs every year. Now, over the next few weeks, another large but definitely cuter silhouette will take its place: a 43-foot terrier puppy made of flowers will go up in front of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, in the same spot where the tree stands.</p>
        <p>''Puppy,'' by Jeff Koons, the 1980's art star, was created in 1992 for a temporary exhibition in Arolsen, a small town about 40 minutes by car from Kassel, Germany, where it stood in the center of a courtyard of a Baroque palace. It was shown in Sydney in 1996, and an identical puppy (with different flowers suitable to its climate and location) stands in front of the Guggenheim Bilbao in Spain as part of the permanent collection.</p>

        <p>Rockefeller Center is famous for the 100-foot Christmas tree it installs every year. Now, over the next few weeks, another large but definitely cuter silhouette will take its place: a 43-foot terrier puppy made of flowers will go up in front of 30 Rockefeller Plaza, in the same spot where the tree stands.</p>
        <p>''Puppy,'' by Jeff Koons, the 1980's art star, was created in 1992 for a temporary exhibition in Arolsen, a small town about 40 minutes by car from Kassel, Germany, where it stood in the center of a courtyard of a Baroque palace. It was shown in Sydney in 1996, and an identical puppy (with different flowers suitable to its climate and location) stands in front of the Guggenheim Bilbao in Spain as part of the permanent collection.</p>
        <p>''Puppy'' has never been seen in New York until now. The installation, -- a three-week process that involves about 100 people, ranging from riggers to planters and engineers, all directed by Mr. Koons -- begins early next week. ''Puppy'' will be on view through Labor Day.</p>
        <p>''We continue to look for ways to enhance the public space at Rockefeller Center,'' said Jerry Speyer, president of Tishman Speyer Properties, which is co-owner and manager of Rockefeller Center. ''It's a great work of art, and I thought it would be wonderful to show it here.''</p>
        <p>Last year Rockefeller Center presented an outdoor exhibition of Rodin sculptures. It has also had a car show and a flower show. ''This is a different kind of flower show,'' said Mr. Speyer, adding that he expected about three million visitors to view ''Puppy.''</p>
        <p>Putting the sculpture together is no easy task. Rockefeller Center asked the Public Art Fund, a nonprofit group that puts together exhibitions around the city, to organize the project. ''Puppy'' had to travel by ship and train from Sydney, a journey that took about a month and a half.</p>
        <p>The installation is so complex because the work is formed from a series of stainless-steel armatures built to hold more than 25 tons of soil. An internal irrigation system waters more than 70,000 flowering plants, including marigolds, begonias, impatiens, petunias and lobelias from different nurseries on Long Island.</p>
        <p>''We think this is one of the great sculptures of our time,'' said Susan K. Freedman, president of the Public Art Fund. ''Rockefeller Center is the perfect backdrop to show it.''</p>
        <p>The Mass MOCA Boom</p>
        <p>When the $37 million Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art, known simply as Mass MOCA, opened about a year ago on a 13-acre campus in the depressed town of North Adams, in the northwest corner of the state, it was understood that the project would create about 100 new jobs and attract scores of visitors to a blue-collar town that had always been overshadowed by neighboring Williamstown. But a year after its opening, the boom created by the arts center has far exceeded expectations.</p>
        <p>''This is certainly an example of how a cultural institution can lead the charge,'' said Joseph C. Thompson, director of the museum. Besides attracting more than 100,000 visitors, the interdisciplinary art center has created more than 200 jobs, he said.</p>
        <p>When Mass MOCA opened, the site, once the home of the Sprague Electric Company, was so large that the institution could develop 20,000 square feet of office space, which it has rented. It has added 15,000 more square feet of office space over the last year. Because its tenants, primarily fast-growing technology companies, are attracting like-minded businesses to the Berkshires, it is renovating an additional 34,000 square feet, all of which has already been leased. Rents have more than doubled.</p>
        <p>''Berkshire County has become a hotbed for e-commerce,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''It's known as Silicon Village.'' One attraction, he said, is that these office spaces were purposely outfitted with what he described as ''plug and ready'' equipment to attract e-commerce companies. Downtown has benefited from Mass MOCA's presence, too. The business district had a 70 percent vacancy rate before the museum opened; now, the rate is 30 percent, Mr. Thompson said. Developers plan to take some of the land adjacent to the museum and erect more offices and a hotel.</p>
        <p>All the tenants on the museum's campus are helping to raise revenues, which are channeled back into the arts complex. That is the difference between Mass MOCA and other cultural institutions that have helped economically depressed areas, like the Guggenheim Bilbao, which has given a boost to the Basque region of Spain, or Dia Center for the Arts in Manhattan, which has contributed to the boom in Chelsea. ''The difference is that we benefit directly from our real estate,'' Mr. Thompson said. ''It's our endowment.''</p>
        <p>Tony Smith Estate</p>
        <p>Tony Smith died 20 years ago, but his estate still holds a significant body of his work. Smith, best known for his huge black modular sculptures, began to exhibit these works in the mid-1960's, when he was 48. Before that, he was both an architect and a painter.</p>
        <p>For years Paula Cooper represented his estate, but it will now be handled by Matthew Marks, the Chelsea dealer, and Lucy Mitchell-Innes, whose gallery, Mitchell-Innes &amp; Nash, is on the Upper East Side.</p>
        <p>''Jane Smith felt it was time for a change,'' said John Silberman, the estate's lawyer, speaking for the artist's widow. Mr. Marks and Ms. Mitchell-Innes also represent the de Kooning estate, which he handles.</p>
        <p>''Considering he was not a prolific artist and died relatively young, the estate is surprisingly rich in top-quality work,'' Mr. Marks said of Smith. He organized a show of the artist's drawings five years ago. ''There are lots of wonderful paintings, some dating from the 1930's, and a surprising number of sculptures, too.''</p>
        <p>Both galleries plan to organize shows over the next two years.</p>
