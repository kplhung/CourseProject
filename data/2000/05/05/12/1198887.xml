        <p>For the last two months, one sure way to coax Hillary Rodham Clinton into attacking Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani was to inquire about tense relations between Mr. Giuliani's police department and the city's minority communities. But when Katie Couric addressed that question to Mrs. Clinton during a nationally televised town hall meeting yesterday morning, the first lady let the pitch pass.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if it is useful for us to point fingers at any one person,'' Mrs. Clinton said, showing uncharacteristic restraint.</p>
        <p>The turmoil surrounding the mayor's personal life has produced, obviously, a challenge to his presumed campaign for a seat in the United States Senate. But Mr. Giuliani's difficulties have also produced an undeclared shift in strategy by Mrs. Clinton these last few days, as her campaign adopts a deliberately low profile while maneuvering to adjust to an unsettled period filled with opportunities and perils.</p>
        <p>The result of that strategy was on display at the town meeting yesterday from NBC studios at Rockefeller Center, where the name Giuliani barely passed Mrs. Clinton's lips during an hour of questioning by an audience of New York voters and the hosts of the ''Today'' show. At the direction of Mrs. Clinton's senior advisers, an aide said yesterday, the first lady and Democratic supporters have moved to shut the spigot on almost all anti-Giuliani rhetoric, as Mrs. Clinton adopts a posture that is intended, unconventionally in this business, to avoid trying to make news, which would have the effect of shifting attention away from the mayor and his problems. (Even the normally voluble state Democratic chairwoman, Judith Hope, did not return phone calls to discuss the state of the race.)</p>
        <p>And next week's state Democratic convention in Albany is being planned as a low-voltage affair, one aide said. Mrs. Clinton's acceptance speech is expected to be undramatic -- devoid of any sweeping philosophical or policy pronouncement -- and President Clinton is unlikely to attend, in part to lower the attention factor, a friend of the Clintons said.</p>
        <p>Part of the reason for this is that Mrs. Clinton's aides believed, even before Mr. Giuliani's recent run of difficulties, that the first lady had hit something of a stride, with a daily mixture of attacks on Mr. Giuliani and policy pronouncements. But the first lady's advisers are now making a deliberate decision to avoid doing anything that might take the spotlight away from the mayor.</p>
        <p>''They're making all the news,'' one of Mrs. Clinton's senior advisers said of the Giuliani campaign. ''What do we need to make news for? If we make news, you can bet it's the wrong kind of news.''</p>
        <p>Instead, the first lady's advisers said, Mrs. Clinton is staying close to the ground: continuing her travels across the state, but eschewing the daily attacks on Mr. Giuliani's temperament, which have drawn much coverage, and focusing instead on the kind of dry policy pronouncements that won't get much attention now. So it was, that for 60 minutes yesterday Mrs. Clinton rebuffed efforts by Ms. Couric to get her to discuss Mr. Giuliani's problems, and instead plunged into long discussions about health care, education and other issues that, if informed, seemed aimed at not breaking any new ground.</p>
        <p>''Our game plan is simply to stay on plan,'' Senator Bob Torricelli of New Jersey, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said in an interview. ''Hillary Clinton is beginning to assume a commanding position. It's now just a question of consolidating her lead.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Torricelli's observations aside, some of Mrs. Clinton's advisers view this as a period of risks as well. For one thing, if Mr. Giuliani does not run, they face the task of retooling a campaign to deal with a new candidate. Mrs. Clinton's advisers said they were most concerned at the prospect of running against Gov. George E. Pataki, given his fund-raising abilities and popularity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki's advisers said that the governor had no interest in running for the Senate. But if Mr. Giuliani decides not to run, the governor will face strong pressure to get into this race, Republicans said.</p>
        <p>In addition, Mrs. Clinton's aides are wary about their candidate or any of her surrogates saying anything that might be perceived as insensitive to Mr. Giuliani's situation, particularly in such a charged media atmosphere.</p>
        <p>''This is the kind of period when you can make mistakes, where you can say the wrong thing,'' a senior adviser said. ''It's easy to make a slip of language on Rudy. You can do a lot of harm in this situation.''</p>
        <p>It has been two months since Mrs. Clinton -- who had been repeatedly criticized by Democrats for running an unfocused and passionless campaign -- turned up her attacks on Mr. Giuliani, assailing him for his response to the police shooting of Patrick M. Dorismond, the same topic that Mrs. Clinton avoided discussing with Ms. Couric yesterday. And in a sense, Mrs. Clinton, in moving to the back of the stage, is responding to the reality of Mr. Giuliani's situation; her campaign strategy is now being driven, at least for the time being, by Mr. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>When or if Mrs. Clinton reassumes a more aggressive pose is also a function of what Mr. Giuliani does and says. For now, though, Mrs. Clinton was described as more than happy to yield to her presumed Republican opponent.</p>
        <p>''She should continue just doing her job: talking about the issues, visiting the entire state,'' said Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat. ''The same exact thing she is doing.''</p>
