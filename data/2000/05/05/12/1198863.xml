        <p>Wilt Chamberlain surely scored 100 points in a game on March 2, 1962. But was the basketball auctioned two weeks ago for $551,841 the one he shot in for his 99th and 100th points at the Hershey (Pa.) Arena, or the ball put in play right after?</p>
        <p>When doubts were raised about the ball two weeks ago, Josh Evans, the chairman of Leland's, the Manhattan auction house, ridiculed the challenges, saying the evidence of the ball's authenticity was ''as tight as you can have.''</p>
        <p>But yesterday, Leland's canceled the sale -- the third-biggest in sports memorabilia history -- citing claims that the ball was not the one Chamberlain sank with 46 seconds left in the Philadelphia Warriors' 169-147 victory over the Knicks.</p>
        <p>''We're not knocking the other people,'' Michael Heffner, the president of Leland's, said of those challenging the ball's authenticity. ''They're credible people. But I believe their memories are deceiving them a bit.''</p>
        <p>Heffner said he still believes the ball Leland's sold is the ball, but the tales of another ''authentic'' ball led Leland's to rescind the sale and surrender its six-figure commission.</p>
        <p>Leland's depended on the word of the seller, Kerry Ryman, articles written many years after the game, and an affidavit by a radio broadcaster who said he saw the 14-year-old Ryman rush onto the court after Chamberlain had scored his 100th point, steal the ball from Chamberlain and scurry from the arena.</p>
        <p>The competing story is this: when Chamberlain got his 100th point, the referee, Willie Smith, gave the ball to the team's trainer, Tommy McCoy, who gave it to Jeff Millman, the head ballboy. Another ball, stored under the scorer's table, was put in play. ''And I ran into the locker room, put it in Wilt's duffel bag, and covered it with a zillion towels,'' Millman said.</p>
        <p>After the game, all the Warriors signed the ball, as did Millman and Eddie Gottlieb, the team's owner. The autographed ball soon became part of a street-level window display at the Sheraton Hotel where the team had its office.</p>
        <p>Harvey Pollack, then the Warriors' public relations director and statistician, said the ball Ryman most likely stole was the one put in play for the final 46 seconds of the game.</p>
        <p>Pollack also challenged the claim that Chamberlain and the Warriors did not want the ball back when Ryman's family offered it. ''If you knew Eddie Gottlieb like I did, Eddie would yell if a pair of socks or a towel was missing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The ball Pollack believes Chamberlain used to score his 100th point is nowhere to be found, apparently lost when the Warriors moved to San Francisco after the 1961-62 season.</p>
        <p>Another twist, recounted last October in The San Francisco Chronicle after Chamberlain's death, was that he gave the ball to Al Attles, one of his teammates, 15 years ago. On the day Chamberlain scored 100, Attles shot 8 for 8.</p>
        <p>But Attles said yesterday, ''All I know is, there's a ball somewhere, but I don't have it.''</p>
        <p>The tale of Chamberlain's ball illustrates a problem rife in sports memorabilia: authenticating collectibles can be difficult unless it comes directly from a player.</p>
        <p>''Unless you know it came from a certain player, you're taking a risk on someone saying it came from Bob Feller and it didn't,'' said Barry Halper, who sold much of his renowned collection last year at Sotheby's. ''Wherever there is profit to be made, it promotes thievery.''</p>
        <p>People call Halper frequently to tell him about items they belatedly found to be fakes, or try to to sell him items with dubious histories. He said he was called yesterday by a man trying to sell him a watch that a player supposedly received for playing in a World Series. ''I said, 'No, they didn't give out watches, they gave them rings.' '' Halper said.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, memorabilia isn't exactly what it says it is. It's not fraud, just imperfect authentication. At Christie's last month, a uniform billed as ''probably'' the last one worn by Joe DiMaggio was not. Halper said the catalog showed a uniform with a patch on one sleeve, but the 1951 World Series uniform carried no such adornment.</p>
        <p>''That's correct,'' said John Martino, Christie's sports memorabilia specialist. ''In the letter of authenticity, DiMaggio claimed to have worn it in the World Series.'' Martino said it was a 1951 uniform -- just not one from the World Series.</p>
        <p>Far beyond imprecision is outright fraud, which is rampant in sports collectibles. Three federal agencies arrested 26 people last month, breaking up a San Diego-based autograph scam, seizing $10 million in allegedly forged collectibles. Also last month, six people sued eBay, the on-line auctioneer, over sales of fraudulent memorabilia.</p>
        <p>''A fraud in the hundreds of millions of dollars is going on every day in every city in every shop,'' said Philip Halpern, the deputy United States attorney in San Diego, who ran the investigation into the autograph scam. ''People go out every day and buy fraudulent goods.''</p>
        <p>He estimated that up to 90 percent of signed memorabilia is fraudulent.</p>
        <p>The surest way to authenticate a collectible is ''knowing how you got it; you have to get it from the people involved,'' Halpern said. For example, a family keepsake would be a baseball signed by Jackie Robinson. ''My dad got it from Jackie,'' Halpern said, ''and my dad gave it to me. That's how I know it's genuine.''</p>
