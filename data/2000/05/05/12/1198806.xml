      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says Army inspector general's office has substantiated accusation by Lt Gen Claudia Kennedy that she was sexually harassed by another Army general; says unsuccessful attempts by some in military to accuse her of personal misconduct, in effort to undermine her credibility, show how much more work needs to be done to eliminate retrograde attitudes toward women in military</p>

        <p>The Army inspector general's office has substantiated the accusation by Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy, the Army's highest-ranking woman, that she was sexually harassed by another Army general, according to defense officials. The disturbing case shows that ending harassment of women is no easier in the top officer ranks than it is in the barracks.</p>
        <p>General Kennedy filed a complaint against Maj. Gen. Larry Smith last summer after General Smith's appointment as the Army's deputy inspector general, whose duties would include investigating sexual misconduct complaints. She charged that General Smith had touched her inappropriately and tried to kiss her in her Pentagon office in 1996. Army officials have said that she did not complain, even informally, to her superiors at the time of the incident. But investigators were able to interview friends and colleagues who were told of the incident soon after it occurred, and they came to believe General Kennedy's account.</p>

        <p>The Army inspector general's office has substantiated the accusation by Lt. Gen. Claudia Kennedy, the Army's highest-ranking woman, that she was sexually harassed by another Army general, according to defense officials. The disturbing case shows that ending harassment of women is no easier in the top officer ranks than it is in the barracks.</p>
        <p>General Kennedy filed a complaint against Maj. Gen. Larry Smith last summer after General Smith's appointment as the Army's deputy inspector general, whose duties would include investigating sexual misconduct complaints. She charged that General Smith had touched her inappropriately and tried to kiss her in her Pentagon office in 1996. Army officials have said that she did not complain, even informally, to her superiors at the time of the incident. But investigators were able to interview friends and colleagues who were told of the incident soon after it occurred, and they came to believe General Kennedy's account.</p>
        <p>If the findings are upheld by higher authority, General Smith may be forced to retire and given only a reprimand, because, officials say, the incident does not merit prosecution under the military code of justice.</p>
        <p>By stepping forward to oppose General Smith's appointment to a sensitive position, General Kennedy has done the Army a great service. But she was criticized both inside and outside the military after her complaint became public. She was even accused of personal misconduct by a retired Army officer whose charges were found to be baseless. Such attempts to undermine her credibility show how much more work needs to be done to eliminate retrograde attitudes toward women in the military.</p>
