        <p>The House overwhelmingly approved a sweeping environmental measure today that sets aside $45 billion over 15 years to buy parks and open spaces, pay for wildlife protection and restore damaged coastal areas.</p>
        <p>By far the biggest environmental initiative of this Congressional term, the bill was supported by large numbers of Republicans as well as Democrats, reflecting the election-year appeal of a plan that would channel large sums of money back to home districts and give lawmakers a chance to cast what many portrayed as a vote on behalf of the environment.</p>
        <p>By redirecting money the government collects from oil drilling royalties, the bill would commit about $3 billion annually over 15 years to buy  private lands considered at risk from development, to repair coastal lands harmed by oil drilling, to rebuild eroded beaches and to help communities create soccer fields and bicycle paths.</p>
        <p>In its broadest terms, the measure has support from the White House but faces an uncertain future in the Senate, where its prospects may hinge on a handful of Republicans who regard it as a threat to private property rights.</p>
        <p>In a statement today, Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt warned against changes that might weaken conservation provisions in the measure. Mr. Babbitt said that a strong act could leave ''a legacy of parks, green space, wildlife habitat and recreational and historic treasures for future generations.''</p>
        <p>By any gauge, though, the vote -- 315 to 102 in favor of the measure -- was a powerful indication of bipartisan support. If the bill becomes law, it would more than double the government's budget for land acquisition, and would institute the broader principle that revenue from oil and gas leases ought to be channeled toward environmental protection.</p>
        <p>''This is the biggest dollar commitment that America has made to the conservation of resources in the last 25 years, and maybe even forever,'' said Representative George Miller of California, the ranking Democrat on the House Resources Committee, who has long been one of Congress's  most outspoken advocates of conservation issues.</p>
        <p>In a rare alliance that reflected the broader bipartisanship, Mr. Miller worked closely in drafting the bill with Representative Don Young of Alaska, the Republican who heads the committee. The two men usually find themselves at opposing sides of environmental questions.</p>
        <p>Among the states that would stand to gain most under the measure, Alaska with its long coastline and extensive oil drilling ranks high on the list, with $163 million to be set aside for conservation efforts by local, state and federal agencies.</p>
        <p>California, Florida, Louisiana and Texas would be among other big beneficiaries, but every state would receive some money.</p>
        <p>New York would receive about $102 million, including about $28 million for land acquisition.</p>
        <p>In all, the measure would devote $900 million a year for land acquisition, with the money to be divided equally between the federal and state governments. The legislation does not identify the plots of land to be acquired. The federal budget for buying land is now about $370 million.</p>
        <p>A separate package of $1 billion a year would be set aside for the restoration of coastal areas, including measures to restore wetlands, ease beach erosion and otherwise repair local ecosystems affected by oil drilling. Other financing would be allocated for wildlife conservation, historic preservation, Indian-land restoration and urban parks and recreation programs.</p>
        <p>The federal government now collects about $4 billion annually from oil and gas leases, mostly for drilling rights in the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska. That money has long been treated as general revenue, but in allocating $3 billion of those funds the measure requires that they be spent only for environmental purposes.</p>
        <p>A more modest measure proposed by President Clinton last year would have set aside $1.4 billion a year for ''land legacy'' programs, and some lawmakers have criticized the House bill as a unwise blow to budget discipline. But the White House expressed support for the measure after lawmakers rewrote provisions that had seemed to hold out incentives for communities that allowed oil drilling.</p>
        <p>Among the bill's opponents were nearly all members of the House Republican leadership, as well as some rank-and-file Republicans who have denounced the land-buying program as an affront to private-property rights.</p>
        <p>But the leaders said that the breadth of support for the measure expressed by other Republicans left them with little alternative but to allow it to come to a vote today.</p>
        <p>In the end, 118 Republicans joined 196 Democrats and 1 independent in voting for the measure. Ninety-three Republicans, 8 Democrats and 1 independent voted no.</p>
        <p>The battle now shifts to the Senate, whose rules make it easier for individual lawmakers to disrupt a bill's passage. A bipartisan majority appears to favor the measure, but Western Republicans have indicated that they may try to derail it on property-rights grounds.</p>
        <p>''We still have a long way to go,'' said Senator Frank H. Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, a sponsor of the Senate measure.</p>
