        <p>The Fire Department has expanded its driver-training program in response to an incident last month in which an engine company did not answer an alarm because the firefighters assigned to the pumper truck said they did not know how to drive it.</p>
        <p>Commanders of every engine and ladder company have been ordered to train, over the next month, about 4,000 firefighters who have never been taught to drive the equipment. This is to be done by having them operate the vehicles during nonemergency runs on city streets.</p>
        <p>The Manhattan borough president, C. Virginia Fields, and officials of the fire unions have objected to training on city streets, saying it is dangerous to have so many inexperienced drivers navigating 40,000-pound trucks through often-crowded areas.</p>
        <p>''The city has more than adequate training facilities,'' Ms. Fields said yesterday, ''and should not, in any circumstances, jeopardize pedestrian or driver safety.''</p>
        <p>But fire officials said firefighters have been trained to drive trucks on city streets for decades without any serious accidents and the only change in the program is one of scope. That training, however, was less extensive, and generally only about half of the 25 firefighters assigned to each company were taught. Overall, officials estimate that half of the 8,800 firefighters have been trained to drive the trucks.</p>
        <p>The decision to increase the training in the city's 344 engine and ladder companies was made last month after Engine Company 303 in Queens took itself out of service. Its driver was hurt in a firehouse accident and the four remaining firefighters on duty said they did not know how to drive the truck.</p>
        <p>Several minutes later, when a fire was reported in the area in Jamaica that the company serves, a nearby engine company responded. No one was seriously hurt in the fire, but fire officials said they were disappointed the company had not tried to get there.</p>
        <p>''We don't ever want to be in a position again,'' said First Deputy Fire Commissioner William Feehan, ''where there are four firefighters staring at a firetruck and saying, ''Well, I don't know how to drive it. Do you?' ''</p>
        <p>Under the training program, company commanders must ensure that each firefighter spends a minimum of five hours behind the wheel of a truck on nonemergency runs, such as the return from a fire or a trip to a building inspection. The commanders can exempt firefighters who display particularly weak driving skills. The rest are supposed to be trained until they are proficient.</p>
        <p>The program, known as company training, will not replace the driver training school the department operates at Randalls Island. Firefighters who who drive well during company training will generally be selected for the school. The school-trained drivers will continue to be the primary operators of fire vehicles, officials said.</p>
        <p>Capt. Peter Gorman, president of the Uniformed Fire Officers Association, which represents supervisors like captains and lieutenants, said his union thinks the department should expand the formal school training instead of placing so many novice drivers on city streets. By contrast, he said, the Sanitation Department does not allow its drivers to operate trucks on city streets until they have demonstrated some proficiency at the training location.</p>
        <p>Captain Gorman noted that no one in New York State is allowed to drive a truck that weighs more than 18,000 pounds without having a commercial driver's license, ''but here we have people driving fire engines that weigh 40,000 pounds without any experience'' or a commercial license.</p>
        <p>Kevin Gallagher, president of the Uniformed Firefighters Association, said the city should not use supervisory officers, who may not know how to drive trucks, to train firefighters. But department officials said supervisors will oversee the training, while the actual instruction will be handled by firefighters who have already been trained.</p>
        <p>In the Engine Company 303 incident, fire officials have said there were no grounds to discipline the company. But they have said they felt the lieutenant on duty should have driven the truck.</p>
        <p>Captain Gorman said the lieutenant had done exactly what other supervisors have done in the same situation: taken the company out of service until a replacement driver arrived.</p>
