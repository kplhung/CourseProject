        <p>Luis Bunuel's career began with one of the most famous images in cinema -- the sliced eyeball of ''Un Chien Andalou,'' his 1928 collaboration with Salvador Dali -- and ended in the 1970's with a loose trilogy of high-style surrealist extravaganzas for the French producer Serge Silberman. The first of these -- ''The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie,'' which won the Academy Award for best foreign film in 1973 -- has now been rereleased by Rialto Pictures, to celebrate the centenary of the director's birth. More such releases are promised, but ''The Discreet Charm'' is an excellent place to renew acquaintance with Bunuel (who died in 1983), or to meet him for the first time.</p>
        <p>In half a century of moviemaking that took him from his native Spain to Mexico, Italy and France, Bunuel experimented in a wide range of styles, from the Italianate neo-realism of ''Los Olvidados'' (1950) to the tragic eroticism of ''Viridiana'' (1961) to the fashion-magazine sadomasochism of ''Belle de Jour.'' ''The Discreet Charm'' belongs to both his old age and his second childhood: it combines a masterly command of the medium with a mischievous, anarchic sense of imaginative freedom.</p>

        <p>Luis Bunuel's career began with one of the most famous images in cinema -- the sliced eyeball of ''Un Chien Andalou,'' his 1928 collaboration with Salvador Dali -- and ended in the 1970's with a loose trilogy of high-style surrealist extravaganzas for the French producer Serge Silberman. The first of these -- ''The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie,'' which won the Academy Award for best foreign film in 1973 -- has now been rereleased by Rialto Pictures, to celebrate the centenary of the director's birth. More such releases are promised, but ''The Discreet Charm'' is an excellent place to renew acquaintance with Bunuel (who died in 1983), or to meet him for the first time.</p>
        <p>In half a century of moviemaking that took him from his native Spain to Mexico, Italy and France, Bunuel experimented in a wide range of styles, from the Italianate neo-realism of ''Los Olvidados'' (1950) to the tragic eroticism of ''Viridiana'' (1961) to the fashion-magazine sadomasochism of ''Belle de Jour.'' ''The Discreet Charm'' belongs to both his old age and his second childhood: it combines a masterly command of the medium with a mischievous, anarchic sense of imaginative freedom.</p>
        <p>The plot is a kind of metaphysical shaggy-dog story, involving six highly cultivated people trying to sit down to a civilized meal together. Their efforts are obstructed first by a simple misunderstanding -- guests arrive to find their unprepared hostess in her satin dressing-gown -- and then by progressively weirder occurrences involving international drug-smuggling, surprise military exercises and a succession of dreams.</p>
        <p>Before long the film forsakes linear narration altogether and becomes a matrushka doll of alternating realities, dreams within dreams, flashbacks inside of tangents, periodically intercut with shots of the six principals strolling along a desolate country road on their way either to a grand picnic or a Technicolor remake of ''The Seventh Seal.''</p>
        <p>''But what is the meaning of this?'' asks Madame Thevenot (the resplendent Delphine Seyrig, she of the satin dressing gown) when the doings become especially peculiar. And you may ask yourself the same question, at once missing the point and getting the joke. The fun of the film is that the characters play every scene with unflappable propriety and absurd dignity.</p>
        <p>Fernando Rey -- decked out in gray plaid suits and leather gloves and, at one point, an exquisite silk paisley robe -- is a debonair Latin American ambassador who may be at the center of an international drug smuggling operation, may have killed one of his hosts in cold blood and may be having an affair with his best friend's wife, played by the icily elegant Stephane Audran. When the friend (Jean-Pierre Cassel) discovers the two in almost flagrante delicto, they have a drink and make dinner arrangements as if nothing untoward had taken place.</p>
        <p>Time may have rendered the object of Bunuel's satire a bit obscure. The haute bourgeoisie whose fastidiousness he so lovingly lampoons -- the recipe for a dry martini punctiliously offered by Mr. Cassel is the director's own -- has faded into obsolescence. The correctness of their manners may inspire more nostalgia these days than derision, but if you look around, you might notice the stealthy traces of Bunuel's influence in some surprising places.</p>
        <p>His affectionate mockery, his reverence for feminine elegance and the humanity at the heart of his ostentatious perversity make him a sort of eccentric uncle to Pedro Almodovar. His Dada spirit surfaces in ''Being John Malkovich,'' just as his sense of branching, overlapping realities resonates with the pop inventiveness of ''Run Lola Run.'' And there is a spooky, primal dimension to the movie, an evocation of childhood's deepest nightmares and richest sorrows, that may remind you of ''The Sixth Sense.'' But the charm, at once elegant and wildly indiscreet, is Bunuel's alone.</p>
        <p>''The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie'' is playing at the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas, 1886 Broadway, at 62nd Street, (212) 757-2280. Tickets: $9; $5:50 for the elderly and children. Showtimes: 11:15 a.m., 1:15, 3:25, 5:35, 7:45 and 9:50 p.m.</p>
