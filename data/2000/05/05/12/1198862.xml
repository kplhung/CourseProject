        <p>Gail Collins Op-Ed column says Mayor Rudolph W Giuliani and his wife, Donna Hanover, seem to be communicating better with press corps than with each other; says mayor's 'good friend' situation may be private matter, but city does have interest in what Hanover said about mayor's ex-communications director, Cristyne Lategano, who came to City Hall with no strong qualifications except intense loyalty, and later used Giuliani's intense support to snag $150,000 job with New York Convention and Visitors Bureau; says Hanover has given no indication she plans to let her husband off the hook</p>

        <p>If we accept Clinton-era conventional wisdom and assume that a male politician's ability to survive a sex scandal depends on the wife's willingness to impersonate a good sport, Rudy Giuliani has a problem.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Giuliani told reporters this week that he and his wife, Donna Hanover, were separating, Ms. Hanover held a press conference of her own. A professional TV journalist, she didn't bury the lead: ''For several years it was difficult to participate in Rudy's public life because of his relationship with one staff member.''</p>
        <p>That would be Cristyne Lategano, the mayor's former communications director. Ms. Lategano and Mr. Giuliani have always vigorously denied having a romantic relationship, and after multitudinous attempts to track down evidence to the contrary, the exhausted City Hall press corps pretty much let the matter drop.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hanover, however, picked it back up again. She added that when Ms. Lategano departed from City Hall last year, ''I made a major effort to bring us back together,'' but that her husband ''chose another path.''</p>
        <p>That would be Judith Nathan, a nurse whom Mr. Giuliani describes as a ''very good friend.'' For a press conference that lasted only a couple of minutes, Ms. Hanover managed to squeeze in quite a bit of information.</p>
        <p>The ''good friend'' situation may be a private matter, but the city really does have an interest in what Ms. Hanover said about the mayor's ex-communications director. Ms. Lategano came to City Hall with no strong qualifications except intense loyalty, and helped turn the administration into a flock of low-profile yes-men and -women, who encouraged the mayor's tendency to view the world as a war between the forces of good (himself) and evil (anybody who gets in the way). When she left, she used Mr. Giuliani's intense support to snag a $150,000 job with the New York Convention and Visitors Bureau. If this was all done in the name of love, inquiring minds want to know.</p>
        <p>New York City is a pretty sophisticated place, but we have never before heard a mayoral wife accuse her husband of fooling around. Back in the 20's, Mayor Jimmy Walker carried on a very public affair with a young British showgirl, but his missus didn't complain and the press never mentioned it. A New York Telegraph reporter once explained that he and his colleagues ''did not wish to penalize the man for his lack of hypocrisy'' when tons of other public men pretended to be faithful husbands while cavorting in secret.</p>
        <p>That would be an example of the win-win school of political philandering.</p>
        <p>For a while, right after the mayor announced that he was being treated for prostate cancer, Ms. Hanover appeared ready to be supportive. She even gave up a part in the Off Broadway show ''The Vagina Monologues'' -- the sort of sacrifice only a New York City Republican's wife would be capable of concocting.</p>
        <p>But it's pretty hard to stand by a man who appears intent on bolting out the door. Ms. Hanover didn't really have much chance to follow in the line of Hillary Clinton or Senator Charles Robb's wife, Lynda, who managed to pretend that she found that nude-massage story believable. What Mr. Giuliani wants might be more of a friendly ex-spouse -- somebody like John McCain's first wife, Carol, who took the curse off his shabby behavior by issuing warm statements in support of his presidential candidacy.</p>
        <p>So far, through two teary press conferences, Ms. Hanover has given no indication she plans to let her husband off the hook. She used to be a very public political wife, appearing in warm and fuzzy campaign ads and confiding to a reporter that she felt her husband was ''the most virile man . . . so strong and wonderful.'' Then the cone of silence descended, and the couple behaved like tenants in an apartment building nodding vaguely to each other in the lobby.</p>
        <p>Over the past few days the two of them have been confiding in us quite a lot, really. It sometimes feels as if they're communicating better with the press corps than with each other. Mr. Giuliani looked ashen and shaky when he announced the separation, surprising not only his constituents but apparently his wife as well. Yesterday, though, he appeared to be his old cranky self; you could tell he was feeling better when he told one reporter to ''get lost.'' The era of sharing, it seems, is over.</p>
