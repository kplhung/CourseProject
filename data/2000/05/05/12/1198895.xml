        <p>Cristyne Lategano-Nicholas said yesterday that she had never had a sexual relationship with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, and that they merely had ''a very close friendship'' during the six years they worked side by side in City Hall.</p>
        <p>Her remarks came a day after Donna Hanover, Mr. Giuliani's wife, announced that his relationship with Ms. Lategano-Nicholas had damaged their marriage. Ms. Lategano-Nicholas was the mayor's closest aide for six years, accompanying him frequently as his press secretary and then his communications director.</p>
        <p>''What needs to be clear is that the only relationship I ever had with the mayor was a professional one,'' Ms. Lategano-Nicholas said in a telephone interview last night from Yankee Stadium, where she was watching a baseball game with her husband, Nicholas Nicholas. ''There is nothing to prove other than a very close friendship and working relationship.'' She added, ''I'm happy to say we are still friendly with each other, although obviously I don't see him very much.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hanover said on Wednesday that for several years, ''it was difficult to participate in Rudy's public life because of a relationship with one staff member.'' Her aides later confirmed that she was referring to Ms. Lategano-Nicholas, 35, who left City Hall last spring.</p>
        <p>She was married in February to Mr. Nicholas, a golf writer.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lategano-Nicholas is president of NYC and Company, the city's tourism bureau, a job that one former city official said was almost certainly arranged by Mr. Giuliani. She is paid $150,000 a year.</p>
        <p>She left City Hall last May, after taking a leave of absence to aid her mother, who had cancer. She returned briefly in August, when executives at the tourism bureau made it clear that she was the front-runner as soon as she asked for the job.</p>
        <p>One former city official familiar with Ms. Lategano-Nicholas's performance at the tourism bureau said Mr. Giuliani had indeed pressured executives there to hire her. But Mr. Giuliani is also believed to have asked them to hire her predecessor, Fran Reiter, who was a deputy mayor before getting the tourism job in 1997. The city provides $5.6 million of the bureau's $13.6 million annual budget.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Giuliani and representatives of the tourism bureau defended Ms. Lategano-Nicholas's work at the bureau, and her hiring there. ''Cristyne Lategano was an excellent communications director,'' Mr. Giuliani said at his daily news conference. ''And the reality is that she's doing an excellent job now.''</p>
        <p>Asked whether she feared that Ms. Hanover's statement would damage her reputation, Ms. Lategano-Nicholas said, ''You're always concerned about that,'' but added, ''This will pass, and my work stands for itself.''</p>
        <p>The former city official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said some of the bureau's board and staff members were initially unhappy that Ms. Lategano-Nicholas had gotten the job. But the official said Ms. Lategano-Nicholas quickly won them over, in part by working tirelessly. The official said that while people at the tourism bureau viewed Ms. Lategano-Nicholas as a patronage employee, they saw the situation not as ''the mayor's girlfriend being rewarded,'' but as ''the mayor's loyal aide being rewarded.''</p>
        <p>Howard Rubenstein, the bureau's spokesman, said Ms. Hanover's statement would ''absolutely not'' hurt Ms. Lategano-Nicholas's career. ''She's done probably the best job in that position of any executive they've had in recent history,'' Mr. Rubenstein said. ''She has been very good at the trade shows and conventions. She's strengthened the staff and they are loyal to her.''</p>
