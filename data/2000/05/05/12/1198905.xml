        <p>As a seminary student in Chicago, he was the only member of his class chosen to go to Rome to finish his theology studies.</p>
        <p>As a young priest, he spent a mere year in a parish before he was plucked to serve as an assistant to the cardinal of Chicago.</p>
        <p>And later in the Vatican, he was one of six experts in church law selected to spend mornings with Pope John Paul II over breakfast, helping him review each word of the proposed new Code of Canon Law.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, after a week of unusually explicit leaks, the Vatican formally announced that Bishop Edward Michael Egan of Bridgeport, Conn., had been chosen the ninth archbishop of New York, to succeed Cardinal John O'Connor, who died last week at the age of 80. He is to be installed as archbishop on June 19 in a ceremony at St. Patrick's Cathedral.</p>
        <p>''We used to say we wouldn't be surprised,'' said the Rev. Roger Caplis, a seminary classmate of Bishop Egan's in Chicago, ''that if anything happened in New York, Ed would be considered. They know him in Rome. That makes a big difference.''</p>
        <p>Hours after the Vatican's announcement, Bishop Egan appeared before the news media in Manhattan, saying that when he first learned of the appointment several weeks ago, ''My first reaction was, Edward, get down on your knees and beg the Lord to give you a hand, and don't get up too quickly.''</p>
        <p>Well over six feet tall and burly with a voice to match, Bishop Egan, 68, told a television reporter who reminded him that he is now the boss, ''I don't feel like the boss, but give me a little time and I will.''</p>
        <p>Those who have tracked Bishop Egan's 43-year career in the church say that he is a man who likes to take charge.</p>
        <p>In Bridgeport, he had his hands in everything from the pension plan to celebrating the confirmation Masses for nearly every child confirmed in the diocese. His supporters praise him as a hands-on administrator, a successful fund-raiser, a lively intellectual and a talented homilist.</p>
        <p>But some who know him worry that he has spent so much of his career in Rome that he is not adequately in touch with the church in America, where laypeople have assumed an increasingly important role. His parish experience was so brief that he has been pegged as an ''office priest'' rather than a ''street priest.''</p>
        <p>In Bridgeport, his critics say he has responded more as a legal adversary than as a pastor to parishioners claiming they had been sexually abused by priests in his diocese.</p>
        <p>People who have known both Bishop Egan and Cardinal O'Connor say that the two men are temperamental opposites, with very different styles and skills. Where Cardinal O'Connor was spontaneous and blunt, Bishop Egan is cautious and measured. While Cardinal O'Connor was earthy, the son of a union man, Bishop Egan is courtly, the son of a businessman.</p>
        <p>Where the cardinal was more interested in ministering than in managing the business affairs of the enormous corporation that is the New York Archdiocese, Bishop Egan involved himself in everything from architectural plans for churches to building the endowment of the diocese.</p>
        <p>And while Cardinal O'Connor was loath to close even underused schools and churches, Bishop Egan has made some tough and unpopular decisions in Bridgeport to consolidate and, in some cases, shut facilities in his diocese.</p>
        <p>''He's shown tremendous strength and decisiveness,'' said Richard F. Futie, pastor at St. Mary's Church in Stamford. ''He's been efficient, wise, prudent and thrifty, and put us on a solvent course.''</p>
        <p>Bishop Egan is, by all accounts, extremely erudite. He is fluent in Latin, Italian and French, and learned to speak Spanish while in Bridgeport, which is home to many Hispanic Catholics. He plays classical piano. He reads up on quantum physics and cosmology.</p>
        <p>He has scant experience in the political spotlight, however, receiving a few national headlines for speaking out against abortion and in favor of taxpayer-financed vouchers for private and secular schools.</p>
        <p>In a little-known move, he was one of only two Catholic bishops to endorse a group affiliated with the Christian Coalition, the conservative political lobby founded by Pat Robertson and Ralph Reed.</p>
        <p>The Catholic Alliance had been set up to attract Catholics to the work of the Christian Coalition, which was perceived to be dominated by Protestants. But it quickly ran into fierce opposition from bishops who did not welcome the idea of a politically conservative, Republican-leaning group presuming to speak for Catholics in America.</p>
        <p>Bishop Egan now serves as one of five bishop advisers for the Catholic Alliance, which is now independent from the coalition.</p>
        <p>Bishop Egan is not a newcomer to the New York archdiocese. But last time, he received a less than warm welcome. In 1985, Bishop Egan was appointed an auxiliary bishop in the archdiocese after spending 14 years in Rome. Cardinal O'Connor made it no secret that Bishop Egan had been foisted on him by the Vatican.</p>
        <p>Priests in New York still remember the letter that Cardinal O'Connor sent to his clergy members explaining that Bishop Egan was not his choice, and that any one of them would have been just as qualified.</p>
        <p>When it came time toast his new auxiliary bishop at a dinner in Rome in Bishop Egan's honor, Cardinal O'Connor raised his glass and proclaimed him ''Chicago's revenge on New York.''</p>
        <p>When Bishop Egan left for Bridgeport three years later, many priests said that Cardinal O'Connor was not sorry to see him go.</p>
        <p>''His relationship with O'Connor was very professional, but I don't think it was warm,'' said the Rev. Richard J. Ehrens, an old friend of Bishop Egan who is a priest in Harwood Heights, Ill. ''I think they just had a mutual tolerance agreement.''</p>
        <p>Edward Michael Egan grew up in a large, comfortable home in Oak Park, Ill., the son of Thomas J. and Genevieve Costello Egan. He had two brothers and a sister, all of whom have died.</p>
        <p>He decided early on a priestly vocation, attending a junior seminary before receiving a bachelor's degree in philosophy from St. Mary of the Lake Seminary, in Mundelein, Ill., and finishing his studies in Rome at the Pontifical North American College.</p>
        <p>He received a theology degree from the Pontifical Gregorian University, considered one of the best in Rome. On Dec. 15, 1957, he was ordained there, and returned to Chicago the next year. The church where he worked so briefly was not just a local parish, but Holy Name Cathedral in Chicago. In no time, he was sent to the chancery offices to assist Cardinal Albert Meyer.</p>
        <p>He spent 1960 to 1964 back in Rome, earning a doctorate in canon law from Pontifical Gregorian and taking the job of repetitor, which meant that he would repeat the Latin lectures to seminarians in English.</p>
        <p>The current rector of Pontifical North American, Msgr. Timothy Dolan, said he was revered by students and described him as ''lovable and charming, a strong and decisive Irishman -- the kind who could really touch the heart at a policeman's funeral.''</p>
        <p>He was in Chicago from 1964 to 1971, working for Cardinal John Cody as secretary and co-chancellor, and on commissions on interfaith relations and social concerns. At one point, Cardinal Cody named him to replace an experienced liberal priest as head of a commission on urban affairs, which meant culling contacts in minority neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>''It was like putting a square peg in a round hole,'' said the Rev. Thomas Ventura, a priest in Winnetka, Ill. ''If you can distinguish between a street priest and an office priest, Ed Egan was an office priest. But in fairness to him, he really worked hard. It was not his natural milieu, but I think he's a good soldier and did the best he could.''</p>
        <p>From Chicago, Bishop Egan was sent again to Rome to be a judge on the Sacred Roman Rota, a 21-member tribunal of judges who work in panels of three hearing appeals in many matters of church law, especially marriage annulments. He also taught canon law at the Pontifical Gregorian.</p>
        <p>During these years he was so immersed in Roman life that once, as a guest on a television program during a visit back to Chicago, he had to search for words in English to express himself.</p>
        <p>''I had never seen him at a loss for words, so I said to him, 'Ed, what's going on?' '' said his friend Father Caplis, the host of the television show. ''He said: 'You know what's happening? I think in Latin.' ''</p>
        <p>(At his New York news conference yesterday, Bishop Egan answered a question in English but used an English translation of the Italian word for condoms, ''preservatives,'' to the confusion of some reporters.)</p>
        <p>After 14 years in the Vatican, Bishop Egan was consecrated a bishop and sent to New York to serve as an auxiliary to Cardinal O'Connor, where he was given the post of vicar for education. He won respect for his focus on administering Catholic schools.</p>
        <p>But he did not hesitate to speak out on public schools, appearing in 1987 at a contentious City Council hearing about a proposal to distribute contraceptives in high school health clinics.</p>
        <p>He criticized the city's sex education program and advocated teaching abstinence, telling the Council members: ''Try decency. Try chastity. Try Western civilization,'' instead of waiting for AIDS ''to put an end to us all.''</p>
        <p>As vicar of education, Bishop Egan waded into turbulent waters when he tried to replace the long-serving Catholic chaplains at both Columbia and New York Universities with more conservative clergymen.</p>
        <p>Paul E. Dinter, who had served 15 years as chaplain at Columbia, when Bishop Egan removed him.</p>
        <p>''He doesn't mind being the bad guy,'' said Mr. Dinter, who has left the priesthood and now runs an education program at the women's prison in Bedford Hills, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Bishop Egan also tried to remove the Rev. Raymond Rafferty from the chaplaincy at New York University. But after the conflict became public, Bishop Egan was overruled by Cardinal O'Connor, who allowed Father Rafferty to stay on for another year and a half, to the cheers of his student congregation.</p>
        <p>But Bishop Egan was a short-timer in New York, which church officials say was always the Vatican's intention. After three years and seven months, he was named bishop of the Diocese of Bridgeport.</p>
        <p>The Diocese of Bridgeport is small, home to 360,000 Roman Catholics in 88 parishes, a far more manageable operation than its giant neighbor to the south, the Archdiocese of New York, which has 2.4 million church members.</p>
        <p>The Bridgeport diocese includes 33 Catholic elementary schools and five high schools, three nursing complexes, eight homes for the elderly and many charitable programs. Although the seat of the diocese is in struggling Bridgeport, the diocese's borders are also the borders of Fairfield County, which encompass wealthy enclaves like Greenwich, Danbury and Westport.</p>
        <p>Bishop Egan has spent the last 12 years trying to turn the diocese around. Friends say that when Bishop Egan was installed in Bridgeport in December 1988, he was shocked to learn just how deeply the diocese was in debt. Bridgeport was struggling to maintain churches and schools that depended on dwindling populations of immigrant Lithuanians, Slovaks, Poles and Italians, who had once been the mainstays of life in many parishes.</p>
        <p>Bishop Egan reorganized the school system so that the financing of schools was shared in common by the entire diocese and poorer parishes no longer had to bear the cost of their neighborhood schools.</p>
        <p>By pooling the resources and closing several schools that were dilapidated or poorly attended, Bishop Egan strengthened the diocese's 38 remaining Catholic schools, say several local Catholic leaders who observed the process.</p>
        <p>The bishop initiated a fund-raising campaign, beginning in 1995, that raised $43 million in pledges, of which about $28 million has been received, said Dr. Joseph McAleer, the diocese's director of communications. The money has been used to finance seminary education, open a home for retired clergy members, finance Catholic schools and build a substantial endowment.</p>
        <p>In the last two years, the diocese has opened two new schools, including the first Catholic special education school in the state.</p>
        <p>''He kept the schools open, and now they're jammed,'' said Msgr. Stephen DiGiovanni, pastor of St. John the Evangelist Church in Stamford. ''He set the diocese on a solid financial footing.''</p>
        <p>Bishop Egan has also gained attention for his ability to produce homegrown Catholic priests in the midst of a severe shortage of clergymen. He opened the diocese's first seminary residence for young men considering the priesthood six months after he arrived in Bridgeport.</p>
        <p>The diocese has ordained 52 new priests since the residence opened, and 30 men are now studying for the priesthood -- a record that far surpasses the new priests being produced, per capita, in archdioceses like New York or Boston.</p>
        <p>As in many Catholic dioceses, Bridgeport, too, has been shaken by lawsuits charging that priests sexually abused children in churches and schools. As many as 30 people in the small diocese have accused 8 priests of sexual abuse. The plaintiffs accuse both Bishop Egan and his predecessor, Bishop Walter W. Curtis, of shuffling priests accused of being pedophiles from one parish to another instead of confronting the problem.</p>
        <p>Most -- but not all -- of the alleged abuse took place before Bishop Egan took office there.</p>
        <p>Last month, the diocese announced that it had settled one lawsuit for an undisclosed amount.</p>
        <p>Bishop Egan publicly condemned sexual abuse by clergy members in a letter read during Masses in the diocese's parishes. But his defense, the same that he used in his legal deposition, was that priests are independent contractors and therefore his diocese was not liable.</p>
        <p>One of the tests facing Bishop Egan in New York is how much latitude he will give to lay Catholics active in their parishes, and to Catholic institutions controlled not by the clergy but by laypeople.</p>
        <p>When Bishop Egan went to Bridgeport, he was surprised to learn that Sacred Heart University, a Catholic school in Fairfield, was independent, a separate corporation run not by the diocese but by a board of laypeople. As bishop, he was board chairman, but his vote counted no more than those of any of the other 25 board members.</p>
        <p>He tried to have that arrangement changed. He proposed rewriting the bylaws so that the university would be owned by the Diocese of Bridgeport. But the university's board voted overwhelmingly against it.</p>
        <p>''I think he was accustomed to being in charge,'' said Dr. Anthony J. Cernera, president of Sacred Heart, when asked about the incident. ''An independent university is a standard American model, but Bishop Egan was coming out of a long experience in Rome where that's not how it works. But to his credit, he accepted that that's the reality, and he has worked as very well as a member of the board in context.''</p>
