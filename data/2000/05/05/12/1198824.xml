        <p>Young &amp; Rubicam's president and chief executive, Thomas D. Bell Jr., will most likely step down from the advertising agency after it is acquired by WPP Group, executives close to the negotiations said early today.</p>
        <p>Both advertising companies were working into the early morning to formalize WPP's acquisition of Y.&amp; R., one of the last independent advertising agencies, in hopes of formally announcing the deal before the stock market opens here today, the executives said. Y.&amp; R.'s annual meeting will take place today in New York. The companies agreed in principle earlier this week to merge, although they have not announced the deal. As agreed to earlier in the week, WPP will pay 0.835 American depository receipt for each share of Y.&amp; R. While the value of the acquisition has become a moving target because the stocks of both companies have fluctuated, as of Thursday the deal was worth $4.8 billion, down $900 million from when the companies agreed in principle to the arrangement.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Bell will play a prominent role in the integration of the two companies by sitting on a four-person transition committee, he has told executives he has decided to leave once the merger is complete.</p>
        <p>According to executives close to the talks, Mr. Bell originally spurned an acquisition by Martin Sorrell, WPP's chief executive, but later decided it was strategically sound. He also declined an offer by Y.&amp; R.'s board to make the acquisition conditional upon his employment in a job of his choosing, the executives said.</p>
        <p>Several executives said that his relationship with Mr. Sorrell had soured during the earlier negotiations but that over the last week the two had become friendlier.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bell has been chief executive of Y.&amp; R. only since January. Before that, he served as chairman and chief executive of Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising, the company's flagship agency.</p>
