        <p>Jamie Foxx is a witty actor and an intuitive comedian who can sometimes manage to make the lamest material -- the WB sitcom that bears his name, for instance -- amusing. As if to test his powers, ''Held Up,'' which might have worked better as an episode of ''The Jamie Foxx Show,'' strands its star in the middle of the Arizona desert (actually the outskirts of Regina, Saskatchewan) with nothing to do but hold a gun to his own head and negotiate with the North Butte sheriff's department on behalf of the inept stickup man (Eduardo Yanez) who has taken him hostage.</p>
        <p>The movie, casually directed by Steve Rash from what is a moderately jokey script by Jeff Eastin, squanders some promising possibilities and commits the inexplicable crime of separating Mr. Foxx from his co-star, Nia Long, almost the whole time. In the opening scenes, the two of them, playing Mike and Rae, a Chicago couple vacationing in their newly purchased vintage Studebaker, show a rare comic chemistry that turns explosive once Rae discovers that her beau has squandered their nest egg on his cherished ride.</p>

        <p>Jamie Foxx is a witty actor and an intuitive comedian who can sometimes manage to make the lamest material -- the WB sitcom that bears his name, for instance -- amusing. As if to test his powers, ''Held Up,'' which might have worked better as an episode of ''The Jamie Foxx Show,'' strands its star in the middle of the Arizona desert (actually the outskirts of Regina, Saskatchewan) with nothing to do but hold a gun to his own head and negotiate with the North Butte sheriff's department on behalf of the inept stickup man (Eduardo Yanez) who has taken him hostage.</p>
        <p>The movie, casually directed by Steve Rash from what is a moderately jokey script by Jeff Eastin, squanders some promising possibilities and commits the inexplicable crime of separating Mr. Foxx from his co-star, Nia Long, almost the whole time. In the opening scenes, the two of them, playing Mike and Rae, a Chicago couple vacationing in their newly purchased vintage Studebaker, show a rare comic chemistry that turns explosive once Rae discovers that her beau has squandered their nest egg on his cherished ride.</p>
        <p>But instead of fighting it out in the tumbleweeds, Rae hops onto a pickup truck full of cowboys and spends the rest of the movie drinking tequila in the Las Vegas airport, leaving Mike at the mercy of a pubescent car thief, a passive-aggressive convenience store owner, a gang of bumbling robbers and eventually a SWAT team.</p>
        <p>He's probably better off. Ms. Long, whose hauteur is an aspect of her beauty, is nobody you would want to mess with, but she's a perfect foil for Mr. Foxx's quicksilver riffing. He can shift, as if in mid-air, from a strut to a grovel, and his funniest lines tend to be the ones he mutters under his breath, taking back whatever foolish boast just popped out of his mouth. Behind his narrow eyes you can see a darting, improvisational intelligence. If only he used more of it in selecting his projects.</p>
        <p>The fun of ''Held Up'' is all in the setup, which plays off the barely suppressed panic a black man might feel finding himself stranded in a remote spot populated by strange white people who assume he must be either a criminal or a celebrity. A young video game player decides Mike must be Puff Daddy, and soon the local news is reporting that Mike Tyson is involved in a hostage situation out in North Butte. But the movie's farcical momentum is taken prisoner along with Mike and his fellow shoppers, who include a mystical biker type (Michael Shamus Wiles) and a sweet blond woman with a purse full of condoms (Sarah Paulson).</p>
        <p>The actors, to their credit, work hard to help Mr. Foxx squeeze what sparks he can from a static situation that consists of two groups of people staring each other down through plate glass windows (soon shot away for the convenience of the cameras) and waiting for the next thing to happen. There's an exploding hot dog, a dead body in a crate, a skunk and a flesh wound caused by a piece of Cool Ranch Dorito shrapnel, but the steady accumulation of absurdity that's necessary for real farce is missing.</p>
        <p>The audience is made to sit around, like the townspeople who have gathered outside the store, hoping to hear a good joke or two. And there are one or two, which I won't ruin for you. But by the end, even the irrepressible Mr. Foxx seems tired and defeated, and we can only hope he perks up in time for his next movie.</p>
        <p>Fans of ''Northern Exposure,'' meanwhile, may enjoy seeing Barry Corbin and John Cullum, who were in the cast of that show, reunited on the big screen. If only someone had thought to bring along that moose.</p>
        <p>''Held Up'' is rated PG-13 (Parents strongly cautioned). It has some mild profanity and a fair amount of wildly off-target gunfire.</p>
