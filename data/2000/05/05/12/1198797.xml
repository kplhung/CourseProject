        <p>Islamic rebels mounted a major attack outside Chechnya's borders for the first time in nearly nine months today, all but wiping out a convoy of 22 Russian soldiers as it moved down a mountain road in a neighboring region of Russia, Ingushetia.</p>
        <p>The mid-morning ambush of two troop trucks and an armored vehicle in the Caucasus foothills killed 18 Russian Interior Ministry troops and wounded 3 others. One soldier was reported missing.</p>
        <p>Russian officials said the servicemen had finished a tour of duty in Ingushetia and were preparing to head home when the attack occurred.</p>
        <p>''They were attacked treacherously with grenade launchers by bandits who hid in the roadside bush,''the first deputy chief of the Russian general staff, Col. Gen. Valery Manilov, said. ''We hope that we will track them down and punish them for their crime.''</p>
        <p>Russian planes later bombed forests near the ambush site, north of the village of Galashki and just a few miles from the major government-run camps for Chechen war refugees. It was not known whether the attackers were hit.</p>
        <p>With today's deaths, General Manilov said, 2,251 Russian servicemen  have died in the Chechen conflict, a figure some outside experts contend is well below the true number.</p>
        <p>The ambush was a departure for the battered rebels, who had not attacked Russian troops outside Chechnya's borders since the early stages of the Chechnya war last September. The war began last summer after rebels invaded the neighboring province of Dagestan, touching off a struggle with Russian troops along the two provinces' border.</p>
        <p>Rebel leaders threatened on Tuesday to carry their war for Chechen independence into nearby provinces unless Russian troops withdraw by the end of May. The rebels' website, www.kavkaz.org, quoted the guerrilla commander Shamil Basayev as saying the rebels would ''declare jihad across the whole of the Caucasus, everywhere the Russian aggressors are.''</p>
        <p>The main Russian spokesman on the conflict, Sergei Yastrzhembsky, dismissed the threat as ''mere bravado not backed by anything.''</p>
        <p>And in fact, it is not clear that the rebels, backed into southern Chechnya's mountains by the Russians, can widen the conflict beyond periodic ambushes like the one today. The Russian military says many guerrillas have melted into the civilian populations of Chechnya and Ingushetia.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, ambushes like today's make it clear that Russian forces have not restored order to the area, as spokesmen are now claiming. The rebels have staged damaging attacks on Russian convoys on the average of every two weeks since general fighting ended in March, killing as many as 32 soldiers in a single ambush.</p>
        <p>The Russian military says it has killed about 100 rebels this month alone.</p>
        <p>General Manilov argued today that ''despite all the difficulties and complexities, life is returning to normal'' in Chechnya. He said that 296 of the 353 schools had reopened; that 37 of 60 hospitals were in operation, and that some 2,500 rebels had taken up an amnesty offer, extended to May 15, and laid down their arms.</p>
        <p>The subsiding of open war appears to have won over the Council of Europe, a 41-member group that threatened to suspend Russia's membership over human-rights violations in the conflict.</p>
        <p>The group dropped the threat today, at a meeting in Strasbourg, France, after Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov argued that Russia has established its own agency to investigate allegations of crimes and human-rights abuses by its troops.</p>
        <p>The council repeated its demand that Russia open talks with Chechen representatives on a political settlement, but General Manliov and Mr. Yastrzhembsky repeated today that that is not an option.</p>
