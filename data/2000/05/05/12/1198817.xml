        <p>No Hot Time At Four Seasons</p>
        <p>The firetrucks rumbled to a stop Tuesday night outside the Four Seasons restaurant, the international style monument on East 52nd Street. Firefighters in bunker pants stomped in and asked one of the owners, JULIAN NICCOLINI, about a basement blaze.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'Nobody called from here,' '' he recalled.</p>
        <p>The firefighters wanted to see the basement. Mr. Niccolini said, ''I'd be more than happy to take you there,'' and off they went.</p>
        <p>No flames. No smoke.</p>
        <p>Mr. Niccolini had an idea. Maybe whoever reported the fire had confused his restaurant with the Four Seasons Hotel, five blocks away on East 57th Street. The firefighters nodded and left.</p>
        <p>But a Fire Department spokesman said, ''If they went to the hotel, it was nothing of any consequence'' REBECCA WERNER, a spokeswoman for the hotel, was emphatic. ''There was no firetruck here,'' she said.</p>
        <p>A New Hairdo For a New Job?</p>
        <p>CRISTINA FERRARE -- former model, former television personality, former actress, former wife of the upstart auto tycoon John Z. DeLorean -- has reinvented herself.</p>
        <p>Now a blonde, she laughed and said, ''When I turned 50, I told my hairdresser I want to be Sharon Stone just once before I die.'' It was impossible not to ask the obvious question: Do blondes have more fun? ''You know, I think they do,'' she said. Judging by the pronoun, she still talks like the brunette she used to be.</p>
        <p>There has been talk that Ms. Ferrare is being considered as a replacement for KATHIE LEE GIFFORD, the soon-to-depart half of REGIS PHILBIN'S morning show. She had an audition of sorts one morning last week when Ms. Gifford was away and she filled the chair next to Mr. Philbin, as she did several years ago when Ms. Gifford was on maternity leave. ''I truly love that genre,'' Ms. Ferrare said.</p>
        <p>The show's executive producer, MICHAEL GELMAN, had good things to say about Ms. Ferrare but noted that she was only one of many potential co-hosts.</p>
        <p>Yaddo, Yaddo. . .</p>
        <p>The party at Fez, in the Time Cafe on Lafayette Street, was a celebration of Yaddo, the century-old summer artists' colony in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. The sculptor RON BARON played the blues harmonica, the sculptor AVA GERBER flailed in a West African dance, and the painter BABETTE MARTINO, in a red dress that looked something like a figure-skating costume, did a swing dance with an unsteady partner. Then the host, the author JONATHAN AMES, read a story about a place ''that might be Yaddo'' and a tryst he had had there with a 64-year-old woman. At the time, he was 27.</p>
        <p>The night of romance was, he said, decidedly Oedipal.</p>
        <p>The thing was, his parents attended the reading.</p>
        <p>His mother, FLORENCE AMES, who was sitting in a booth at the back of the room, said, ''He really was such a quiet, reserved child.''</p>
        <p>She indicated that Mr. Ames's father, IRWIN AMES, had had a harder time with their son's confessional style and suggested asking him about it. She pointed out a man in a Hawaiian shirt, but he wanted no part of such a conversation. When he was asked if he was Jonathan Ames's father, he said no.</p>
        <p>Mixed Doubles</p>
        <p>DAVID GRANGER, the editor of Esquire magazine, sounded as if getting four guys in shorts together for a photograph was one of his proudest achievements. He said that ANDRE AGASSI, MICHAEL CHANG, PETE SAMPRAS and JIM COURIER had never been in a photograph together, and that arranging it had been an ordeal.</p>
        <p>''The sticking point was, for commercial reasons or whatever, they didn't want to be in the same frame with Michael,'' Mr. Granger said. ''Once they were all there, they were cordial but distant.''</p>
        <p>He said the photographer, MARTIN SCHOELLER, had nine minutes and shot 60 to 70 frames. ''There was only one frame where they were all conspicuously smiling,'' Mr. Granger said, ''after he said something that caught them off guard.''</p>
