        <p>Rerouting and Closings On the E, B and F Lines**Work on New York City subway signals and switches will cause extensive rerouting and closing of some some subway stations along E, B, and F lines (S)</p>

        <p>For the next four weekends, work on the signals and switches along the tracks of the E, B and F trains will cause extensive rerouting and the closing of some subway stations, transit officials said this week.</p>
        <p>The project, which includes replacing track switches at Rockefeller Center, will force the closing of the 53rd Street subway tunnel beneath the East River. The work will take the E train completely out of service and shut down the B line for Manhattan and most of Brooklyn. It will also reroute the Queens-bound F train at 34th Street in Manhattan onto the R tracks. This means that the Lexington Avenue and Fifth Avenue stations on the F line will be closed, as will the 23rd Street-Ely Avenue station on the F line in Queens.</p>

        <p>The changes will be in effect from midnight Saturdays to 5 a.m. Mondays starting tomorrow. On Memorial Day weekend, the service changes will last from midnight Saturday until 5 a.m. on Tuesday.</p>
