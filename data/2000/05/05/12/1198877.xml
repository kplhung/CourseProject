        <p>Making official an appointment eclipsed by the death of Cardinal John O'Connor last week, the Vatican named Bishop Edward Michael Egan of Bridgeport, known for his success in replenishing the priesthood and streamlining church operations, the next archbishop of New York yesterday.</p>
        <p>Formal word of his appointment came in a communique that went out over the Vatican's Web site yesterday morning, just three days after New Yorkers gathered at St. Patrick's Cathedral to bury Cardinal O'Connor. Yesterday, Archbishop-elect Egan returned to St. Patrick's, greeting tourists and praying at the white marble steps to the crypt where Cardinal O'Connor was laid to rest on Monday.</p>
        <p>In coming to New York, Bishop Egan will multiply his responsibilities almost sevenfold, going from a diocese of 360,000 Catholics in Fairfield County to the second-largest, most visible archdiocese in the nation, covering 2.4 million New Yorkers, 412 parishes, more than 250 schools and an array of hospitals, nursing homes, day care centers and other facilities.</p>
        <p>At a news conference yesterday, Bishop Egan, 68, said that he had learned of his appointment to the Archdiocese of New York two weeks ago, but had to deny the news until it became official yesterday. Upon learning of the job ahead, he said, he told himself he should fall to his knees and beg divine help, and ''don't get up too quickly.''</p>
        <p>But Bishop Egan, an experienced canon lawyer who served as auxiliary bishop for education under Cardinal O'Connor from 1985 to 1988, added that he was happy to return to the archdiocese. ''My second reaction was, 'Edward, get up off your knees when the Lord lets you and feel welcomed home.' ''</p>
        <p>A tall and articulate man, Bishop Egan did not hide his delight yesterday in the news that he would be taking charge of the archdiocese. Standing in a corridor before his news conference, he was surrounded by the top officials of the archdiocese, who beamed before the man who would become their new leader. Though they had mourned for Cardinal O'Connor, it was time to turn the page, they said.</p>
        <p>''We're beginning a new chapter in the history of the church in New York,'' said Robert A. Brucato, a former vicar general for Cardinal O'Connor, who is running the archdiocese until Bishop Egan officially becomes the archbishop of New York in a ceremony at St. Patrick's on June 19.</p>
        <p>Though the selection of archbishops follows an elaborate and highly secret winnowing process, Bishop Egan's relationship with Pope John Paul II and his record in Bridgeport weighed heavily in his selection, according to people involved in the process.</p>
        <p>Asked about his proudest achievements during nearly a dozen years in Bridgeport, Bishop Egan spoke of his successes in fund-raising and in ordaining men to revitalize  the priesthood -- not incidentally some of the areas most in need of attention in the New York Archdiocese. Over the last year, more than a score of priests have died in the archdiocese, but only five will be ordained at St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers at its annual graduation next week.</p>
        <p>Bishop Egan said that he carried calling cards with his name on one side and the address of a Bridgeport seminary on the other, which he gave out to young men ''at every confirmation, at every meeting I have.'' He smiled broadly and said that four of the men about to begin final studies for the priesthood ''started with these cards.''</p>
        <p>Vowing to redouble fund-raising efforts and take other measures to shore up schools and parishes hobbled by dwindling enrollment and deteriorating buildings, the bishop nevertheless did not rule out closing or merging some of them, saying, ''We will do what needs to be done.''</p>
        <p>Without using the term, he made a forceful defense of school vouchers, which some religious educators see as the salvation of the parochial school system. ''Every parent must have a right to decide how his or her child should be educated,'' the bishop said.</p>
        <p>The son of a businessman, he is a classical pianist who speaks Latin, Italian, French and Spanish. Church officials said that Bishop Egan was seen as someone who could put the New York Archdiocese on a sound financial footing, and take the heat for unpopular decisions like merging or closing schools or parishes when necessary. In keeping with Vatican protocol, he will be obliged to offer his resignation in seven years, when he reaches 75, which could give the Roman Catholic Church time to groom a Hispanic leader.</p>
        <p>Though all of New York's archbishops have been Irish, Hispanics now account for 36 percent of the Catholics in the New York Archdiocese, which includes Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island, along with seven counties north of the city. Outpacing the Irish, Hispanics are now numerically, though not politically, the most powerful single bloc of Catholics in the archdiocese.</p>
        <p>Asked for a message to the Catholics who are Hispanic, Bishop Egan said, ''They have, in me, a dedicated servant, who loves their culture, loves their language, loves their music and they will probably tell you if you know them in Bridgeport, loves to be with them.''</p>
        <p>Thomas V. Daily, the bishop of Brooklyn, called Bishop Egan ''an engaging homilist and a skillful writer,'' and praised him for  ''encouraging newcomers from Hispanic lands and from Haiti to celebrate their faith and cultural diversity in a new environment,'' and for ''providing stronger financial underpinnings for inner-city schools.''</p>
        <p>At the headquarters of the archdiocese, officials listened to Bishop Egan's answers to the media for signals of how he will lead the archdiocese. Msgr. Ferdinando D. Berardi, director of the liturgical office, said he was encouraged by the bishop's mention of collaboration with priests and lay people in determining the archdiocese's priorities.</p>
        <p>''I also applauded very much his stress on vocations,'' Monsignor Berardi said. ''I was impressed that his calling card had seminary information.''</p>
        <p>While Cardinal O'Connor developed a strong relationship with Jews in his 16 years running the archdiocese, and played an important role in the Vatican's eventual recognition of Israel, Bishop Egan is less well known among Jewish leaders.</p>
        <p>But Rabbi Jack Bemporad, director of the Center for Interreligious Understanding in Englewood, N.J., described Bishop Egan as ''brilliant, fluent and dynamic -- with an outstanding education and a probing intellect.'' For a time, Rabbi Bemporad's center was located at Sacred Heart University in Bridgeport, the Catholic university of the diocese there. Bishop Egan is chairman of the school's board.</p>
        <p>In the parishes of the archdiocese, priests wondered how their lives would change under Bishop Egan, particularly in view of his record of reorganizing parishes and schools.</p>
        <p>''I've heard that he tries to keep the schools very much alive,'' said the Rev. John Flynn, pastor of St. Martin of Tours, in the Crotona section of the Bronx. In the inner cities, he said, religious schools are an anchor for children, particularly in neighborhoods in distress.</p>
        <p>But Father Flynn said the schools were seeing teacher salaries rise to remain competitive, while the costs of medical insurance soar. His own parish's school once had twice the enrollment it does now, but despite the decline, the school remains as urgently needed and vital as ever, he said.</p>
        <p>''I just know we're all sweating,'' Father Flynn said. ''It gets harder and harder.''</p>
