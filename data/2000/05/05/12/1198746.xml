        <p>It was only about 80 years ago that the West started to see pottery as high art, and that view was shaped by Bernard Howell Leach, an English studio potter who learned his art in Japan. It was Leach who said, ''Pots, like all forms of art, are human expressions.''</p>
        <p>With his writings as well as with his ceramics, he played a major role in elevating the status of the European potter from craftsman to artist, thereby paving the way for the 20th-century studio pottery movement.</p>
        <p>Born in 1887 in Hong Kong to British parents, Leach worked first as a painter. In 1909 he went to Japan to teach etching techniques. While there he began to study pottery under Ogata Kenzan VI, a master potter and the last of the Kenzan line. (Kenzan is both a name and a title.) Leach excelled at throwing pots by hand and subtle glazing.</p>
        <p>John Driscoll, the director of the Babcock Gallery in Manhattan and a collector of Leach's work, said, ''The sixth Kenzan had such respect for Leach's work that he passed on his credentials to Leach, who became the seventh Kenzan, probably the only non-Japanese ever to be one.''  In 1920 Leach was invited to join an English artists' community in St. Ives, Cornwall. ''A woman in the community offered him a stipend if he would start up a traditional Japanese kiln,'' Mr. Driscoll said. Leach in turn asked the Japanese potter Shoji Hamada to join him in St. Ives. They worked together for three years, then Hamada (1884-1977) returned to Japan to start his own pottery studio north of Tokyo. In 1955 Hamada was named a Living National Treasure of Japan.</p>
        <p>Leach lived until 1979. ''His 1940 treatise, 'A Potter's Book,' remains the bible of anyone who wants to be a ceramic artist,'' Mr. Driscoll said. ''It's astonishing that there is no place to see his work in New York.'' He added: ''The history of 20th-century ceramics begins and ends with Bernard Leach, whether you are American, British, Danish or Japanese. He made the work of the artist potter a legitimate path to pursue.''</p>
        <p>Louise Cort, curator of ceramics at the Freer Gallery of Art and Arthur M. Sackler Museum in Washington, said: ''Leach was a very important influence on articulating Japanese values about form and issues in ceramics. His book was the first by a potter in England that did not talk about techniques but about art. It was the first book by a ceramics artist speaking as an artist.''</p>
        <p>Paradoxically, Leach is usually considered a ''Japanese'' potter, because he made Japanese-style ceramics. That is why his works, along with those of his Japanese contemporaries, will be in the Phillips Auctioneers May 17 sale of 20th-century Japanese ceramics and design. The viewing, which begins tomorrow, and the sale are at the American Craft Museum, 40 West 53rd Street in Manhattan, which Phillips has rented for the month.</p>
        <p>Though there are relatively few American collectors of 20th-century Japanese ceramics, Dan Klein, the international executive director of Phillips, chose to have the auction in New York. ''I had a concept of what we would do at the craft museum,'' he said. ''I wanted to have our sales of decorative arts and crafts there, along with Impressionist paintings and photography, to show there's no distinction between the decorative arts and fine arts.''</p>
        <p>The May 17 sale includes nearly 100 lots of Japanese stoneware and porcelain, 45 of which came from a private collection in Japan. Some of the teapots, tea bowls, stoneware bottles and pitchers were designed for the Japanese tea ceremony; the majority are studio works by top names in the field. ''We rarely have enough quantity of the quality of these objects to have a whole sale dedicated to them,'' said Ben Williams, the head of the Phillips ceramics department. ''It's taken a couple of years to assemble this sale. The Japanese are object- and vessel-based. They prefer functional wares and hold them in higher esteem than we do. In museums they will place a pot by Hamada or Leach next to a Picasso.''</p>
        <p>Nancy Walkup of the North Texas Institute for Educators on the Visual Arts has written, ''It is important to set aside Western aesthetics as criteria when making judgments about non-Western art.''</p>
        <p>''The primary aesthetic concept at the heart of traditional Japanese culture is the value of harmony in all things,'' she continued. ''This world view is nature-based and concerned with the beauty of studied simplicity and harmony with nature.''</p>
        <p>This aesthetic, particularly as it pertains to the tea ceremony, is sometimes called wabi-sabi. Wabi has to do with understated elegance, peacefulness, modesty and the natural world. Sabi has to do with serenity, having age or history, and showing the maker's hand.</p>
        <p>''The most comprehensive example of the Japanese aesthetic of wabi-sabi is found within the traditions of the tea ceremony,'' Ms. Walkup wrote. ''It symbolizes aesthetic simplicity and represents the fundamental Zen principles of harmony, respect, purity and tranquillity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams said: ''The tea ceremony plays a major part in Japanese ceramics. Objects used in the ceremony are meant to fit the hand perfectly. They inform the way you stand, and the way you hold the cups.''</p>
        <p>The aesthetic is not about perfection but imperfect beauty. Imperfections are revered. ''Imperfection has a human value,'' Mr. Williams said. ''The Japanese seem to appreciate defects. Spur marks on a dish show it's handmade and unique.''</p>
        <p>The sale has several works by Leach. The most unusual is probably the red slipware dish with a leaping deer from about 1928. Because the drawing is freehand, the dish resembles 17th-century English earthenware. Its estimate is $5,000 to $7,000.</p>
        <p>There are also Leach Japanese-style works: stoneware vases glazed in dark olive blues and browns, porcelain celadon tea bowls and a pale green stoneware bottle vase decorated with motifs that look like calligraphy in red overglaze enamel.</p>
        <p>Leach's friend Hamada is also well represented in the sale. And there are examples by lesser known artists. Dr. Frederick Baekeland, a by-appointment-only New York dealer in modern Japanese ceramics since 1976, said names were overrated. ''The name of the game is the name for most people,'' he said. ''Only a small number of collectors and dealers buy on aesthetic grounds only. But you can get more for your money from a person who is not so famous.''</p>
        <p>Though well known in Japan, some potters in the sale are unfamiliar to many Americans: Kanjiro Kawai, Kenkichi Tomimoto, Munemaro Ishiguro, the Living National Treasure Tatsuzo Shimaoka, and Shiro Tsujimura. Many of the pieces in the sale come with the wooden boxes that were made to hold them, and most of the boxes are signed by the artists. Dr. Baekeland said, ''In Japan, a piece without the box is worth half the price, even if the piece is signed.''</p>
