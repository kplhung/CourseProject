        <p>An editorial in a local paper captured the national mood today as a computer student all but admitted creating a destructive program that crippled e-mail systems around the world.</p>
        <p>''Yes, the Filipino can!'' cheered The Manila Standard under the headline, ''The country's first world-class hacker.''</p>
        <p>Fellow students swelled with pride at the drab little computer college where the 23-year-old student, Onel de Guzman, had outlined something close to the rogue program in a thesis proposal. ''It was wrong,'' conceded one of them, ''but amazing!''</p>
        <p>After several days in hiding, Mr. de Guzman appeared at a news conference today, seeming overwhelmed by the extent of the destruction, and admitted that ''it is possible'' that he had unleashed the program that caused tens of millions of dollars of damage in more than 20 countries.</p>
        <p>Hiding behind dark glasses and sometimes burying his face in his hands, Mr. de Guzman said he had been fooling around with fellow students in an informal club called GrammerSoft and had only wanted to create ''a gimmick'' -- a term used among young people here for an event that is exciting and fun.</p>
        <p>Asked what he felt about the damage, he looked down and mumbled, ''Nothing.'' At one point, evading a question, he bent forward in his seat and covered his ears with his hands.</p>
        <p>His lawyer, Rolando Quimbo, who often translated his mumbled answers into full sentences, said the young man had come forward to demonstrate that he was not hiding from the law. He added: ''He is not really aware that the act imputed to him was done by him.''</p>
        <p>This befuddlement seemed telling as this low-tech country finds itself the epicenter of an international furor over crime in cyberspace. Because computers play such a small role in the Philippines, it has never seen the need to write laws governing the Internet. It will take some legal creativity to prove that the creator of the program -- a hybrid of varieties known as viruses and worms -- even committed a crime.</p>
        <p>For most students at schools like the AMA Computer College, where Mr. de Guzman studies, computer literacy is a ticket to a journeyman's job overseas, following in a tradition that has sent millions of Filipinos abroad to work as laborers, nurses and domestic helpers.</p>
        <p>For most other Filipinos, the computer is still a source of futuristic amazement. Because of its low level of computerization, the Philippines itself was not among the nations badly affected by the virus last week.</p>
        <p>This is a country of nearly 80 million people where only 200,000 computers were sold last year. It is a country with one of the world's highest literacy rates, where only 5 percent of public school students have access to computers.</p>
        <p>At the National Bureau of Investigation, the nation's top law enforcement body -- and the body charged with prosecuting the creator of the virus -- criminal files are still kept in big metal cabinets rather than on computers.</p>
        <p>''They were clueless,'' said Chin Wong, editor of Computer World, a twice-monthly Philippine magazine, speaking of the investigators.</p>
        <p>Officials at the bureau said today that they wanted to question Mr. de Guzman and any other students who might have been involved. But they stopped short of calling him a suspect, and there was no immediate move after he surfaced to take him into custody.</p>
        <p>Suspicion had focused on him in recent days when it was learned that he had submitted a thesis proposal in February that contained elements resembling the virus. It had been rejected by teachers who noted on it, ''This is illegal'' and, ''We do not produce burglars.''</p>
        <p>Not burglars, but perhaps national heroes.</p>
        <p>''Hey, here is a Filipino genius who has put the Philippines on the world map,'' wrote Art A. Borjal today in The Philippine Star, a daily newspaper. ''And who has proven that the Filipino has the creativity and ingenuity to turn, for better or for worse, the world upside down.''</p>
        <p>He blamed developed nations for creating a vulnerable computer technology and said the home-grown virus was something that will ''make foreigners look at Filipinos with hidden envy.''</p>
        <p>This was the mood today on Mr. de Guzman's campus, one of many branches of the 10,000-student college known for mass-producing computer journeymen rather than sophisticated programmers.</p>
        <p>''Can you imagine, they were able to penetrate the Pentagon?'' said a computer engineering student who insisted on anonymity. ''Even though the Philippines is a third-world country, even though we're behind in technology, they were able to do that.''</p>
        <p>He was speaking of Mr. de Guzman and a second student, Michael Buen, who school officials said Wednesday might have collaborated with him in creating the virus.</p>
        <p>Another fellow student said: ''This has made us proud. We didn't imagine that an AMA student would be able to do that.''</p>
        <p>Despite the country's low technological level, computer colleges like this one have proliferated in recent years, in large part to serve foreign companies based here or abroad.</p>
        <p>''Computer training is really a ticket for a lot of lower-middle-class families to have their children work abroad,'' said David Celdran, a local journalist who reports on computers and information technology.</p>
        <p>Foreign workers in all fields send home as much as $6 billion a year, the nation's leading source of foreign exchange.</p>
        <p>''The skills they acquire at schools like AMA are really the basic skills -- computer literacy, basic programming, electronics, putting together motherboards, hardware, computer repair -- rather than sophisticated computer engineering or programming skills,'' Mr. Celdran said.</p>
        <p>Mr. de Guzman's emergence today reinforced a growing sense here that one of the most virulent computer viruses ever known was closer to a prank that raced out of control than to an act of premeditated sabotage.</p>
        <p>Officials at the college said Wednesday they believed that he might have intended to steal passwords and Internet access rather than to cause tens of millions of dollars of damage to computer systems around the world.</p>
        <p>The lead investigator at the National Bureau of Investigation, Nelson Bartolome, said today of the creators of the virus: ''They did not know it was criminal. Perhaps it was just a prank.''</p>
        <p>If this is so, one analyst here said, the episode illustrates the vulnerability of computer systems not only to sophisticated vandals but to relatively crude and even unintended destructive acts.</p>
        <p>''I don't think you need very, very sophisticated programming language to create viruses, in the same way that you don't need very, very sophisticated weapons to wreak havoc on a society,'' said Randy David, a sociologist in the Philippines who has studied the problem.</p>
        <p>Mr. de Guzman's thesis proposal described a plan to ''steal and retrieve Internet accounts of the victim's computer'' to gain free access to the Internet.</p>
        <p>This is one of the things the virus did, while also moving through e-mail systems like a poisoned chain letter, paralyzing the accounts of recipients who opened an attachment to an e-mail message with the subject line ''I Love You.''</p>
        <p>After the computer in Mr. de Guzman's apartment was identified as the source of the virus -- with the help of the Federal Bureau of Investigation -- Philippine authorities obtained a warrant for the arrest of two of the residents.</p>
        <p>They took one man, Reomel Ramones, a bank employee, into custody on Monday and held him overnight. They also issued a subpoena for his girlfriend, Irene de Guzman, who also works in a bank and who is Mr. de Guzman's older sister.</p>
        <p>She appeared with him at the news conference today, also wearing dark glasses, and hugging him from time to time.</p>
