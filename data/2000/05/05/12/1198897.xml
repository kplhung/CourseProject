        <p>Of all the scuffles in today's acerbic debate between New Jersey's two Democratic candidates for the Senate, no clash was more bitter than the contestants' exchanges over the volatile issue of Social Security.</p>
        <p>Former Gov. Jim Florio and Jon S. Corzine both tried to appeal to the elderly, who are expected to make up a large segment of the Democrats who vote in the June 6 primary. In their heated remarks about ways to extend the solvency of Social Security, the candidates even disputed whether President Clinton had turned away from his own plan to invest part of the Social Security trust fund in the stock market.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, has embraced Mr. Clinton's proposal to invest 15 percent of the government surplus devoted to Social Security in the stock market and use the proceeds to shore up the government's popular retirement program.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, whose staff has described the proposal as the ''Clinton-Corzine Social Security plan,'' said the plan would yield greater returns than investing in government bonds, and would ensure the system's viability for future generations.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Florio called the plan ''a colossally bad idea,'' invoking Franklin D. Roosevelt to warn that it would generate millions of dollars  for Wall Street brokers while placing elderly Americans at the whims of a volatile stock market.</p>
        <p>''The president and the vice president have clearly and decisively come out and said this is not something that either of them support,'' Mr. Florio said.</p>
        <p>In fact, Vice President Al Gore has withdrawn his support for the proposal. The president has shelved it, citing a lack of support in Congress. But Mr. Clinton's spokesman said earlier this month that the president still supported the concept.</p>
        <p>After the debate, advisers to Mr. Florio conceded that his description of Mr. Clinton's position was a bit of a stretch, but said their intent was to emphasize that the president no longer advocated the proposal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine in turn attacked Mr. Florio's Congressional record on Social Security, saying that Mr. Florio voted against a 1985 bill that would have forced the Treasury Department to restore Social Security assets that the Reagan administration had dipped into to avert a cash crisis.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Florio insisted that Mr. Corzine's description was a distortion. The bill in question was actually a procedural measure to extend the government's borrowing limits, Mr. Florio said, and the Social Security amendment was simply tacked on to make it appear more palatable.</p>
