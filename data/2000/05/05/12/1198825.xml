        <p>At 6 feet 3 inches and 226 pounds, John LeClair is the prototypical power forward in the National Hockey League today.</p>
        <p>This season, the 30-year-old left wing became the first player in Philadelphia Flyers history to score 40 or more goals in five consecutive seasons. He has been a 50-goal scorer three times in his career.</p>
        <p>But no matter how strongly the Vermont native bulled his way to the net, until two months ago, LeClair was still lost in the shadows of his own team. Or, rather, he was obscured by Eric Lindros, the Flyers' 6-4, 236-pound star center.</p>
        <p>No longer. Lindros has been out indefinitely since March 13, nine days after he sustained the fourth of his five concussions in the last two years. While Lindros's status has become a sort of long-running sideshow in the Flyers' progression through the postseason tournament, LeClair has become the team's unquestioned leader on the ice.</p>
        <p>And now with Keith Primeau, Philadelphia's second-most important center, also possibly out of the Eastern Conference finals with a concussion, LeClair is the Flyer whom the Devils will be focusing on most.</p>
        <p>''If we're going to survive, John's a key guy,'' said Philadelphia's interim head coach, Craig Ramsay. ''Everyone knows that.''</p>
        <p>The key guy is more like it. Even if Primeau, who will be re-evaluated on Friday, and Lindros, who is hoping to rejoin the team May 23, were healthy, that might be the case.</p>
        <p>LeClair leads Philadelphia with six goals this postseason. He scored three power-play goals in the first round as Philadelphia dispatched the defending conference champion Buffalo Sabres in five games. He temporarily knocked not one, but two, Pittsburgh defensemen out of Game 3 of the second round -- and scored a goal to boot. For an encore, LeClair scored the game-winning goal in the series-clinching Game 6.</p>
        <p>''Johnny's always the guy we count on for big plays,'' said defenseman Chris Therien, who rooms with LeClair on the road.</p>
        <p>Lindros used to be that player. But the Flyers are no longer Lindros's team. By stripping Lindros of his captaincy in absentia late in the season, the Philadelphia players made sure where they stood on that.</p>
        <p>When asked whether the Flyers were looking ahead to a possible Lindros return, LeClair said: ''Not really. We've been winning with this team. If he comes back, it's a bonus.''</p>
        <p>A distraction might be more like it.</p>
        <p>''Maybe you do it unconsciously,'' said Therien, saying LeClair may have something to prove in Lindros's absence. ''You want to prove a point, that we're not a one-man team.''</p>
        <p>LeClair, who finished with 40 goals, said that this season had been difficult. ''I've never had a year like this,'' he said. ''That's for sure.''</p>
        <p>Asked to elaborate, LeClair said, ''There have been a few things off the ice.''</p>
        <p>First there was the off-season death of a teammate, Dmitri Tertyshny, in a boating accident. Then there were the controversial back injuries that both Lindros and LeClair sustained working out together over the summer. That was part of the never-ending Lindros saga, which includes his feuds with General Manager Bobby Clarke, the concussions, the stripping of his captaincy. There has also been the saga of Coach Roger Neilson's battle against cancer, not to mention Neilson's battle to retake the reins of the team from Ramsay.</p>
        <p>And still the Flyers have not lost their focus.</p>
        <p>When someone mentioned earlier this week that Philadelphia would be weak without Lindros and Primeau, Devils defenseman Ken Daneyko shook his head, meaning no. LeClair, said Daneyko, is still one of the best forwards in the league.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey captain, Scott Stevens, Coach Larry Robinson's most physical defenseman, shut down Florida's Pavel Bure in the first round, Toronto's Mats Sundin in the second. Both are perimeter players, however. LeClair's game is parking himself in front of the net and daring someone to move him. Or bulldozing around the net, with both the puck and a helpless defender in tow.</p>
        <p>Stevens's biggest test, therefore, is yet to come, perhaps starting on Sunday when the four-of-seven-game conference finals begin at Philadelphia. ''Scotty will probably play against LeClair or Mark Recchi,'' Robinson said Wednesday. ''Or both, if they're on the same line.''</p>
        <p>They usually are. And don't expect LeClair to ask Ramsay out of the expected matchup with Stevens. Ramsay doesn't.</p>
        <p>''I've asked him many times before, 'Do you want me to change things around?' '' Ramsay said. ''He always says, 'No, I can handle it.' And he does.''</p>
        <p>LeClair is one of the few current Flyers in possession of a Stanley Cup ring. He and the current Philadelphia captain, Eric Desjardins, won one with Montreal in 1993, two seasons before they were traded to the Flyers for Recchi.</p>
        <p>That was the season the Flyers were bounced from the playoffs in the conference final by the Devils in the last postseason meeting between the two rivals. LeClair said what he most remembered about the 1995 series with New Jersey was ''Claude Lemieux scoring from the blue line.'' LeClair said it with a bitter laugh.</p>
        <p>It was Lemieux's long slap shot, which beat an unobstructed Ron Hextall in the waning moments of regulation in Game 5 to seal -- the Flyers might say steal -- a 3-2 New Jersey victory in Philadelphia. The Devils then prevailed, 4-2, at home in Game 6 to take the series on their way to the Stanley Cup.</p>
