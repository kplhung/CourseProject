        <p>Monika Horakova, a sparky psychologist of 26, is a member of the Czech Republic's  Parliament -- the only one who is a Roma, or Gypsy. But she is still seeking criminal prosecution of the club in her hometown, Brno, that barred her because of her race.</p>
        <p>''It's happened many times to me,'' she said. ''But the problem is the process. When you want to get your rights and fight, it's very difficult. It's hard to prove discrimination, and it's up to the state prosecutor.''</p>
        <p>Once, in 1998, the club owner simply said the place was full and, after she complained to the police, a  bouncer told them that she had been  ''drunk and arrogant,'' she said, laughing. The police did not bother to investigate her charges further. Last autumn, she said, she was told explicitly, ''You can't go in because you're a Gypsy.''</p>
        <p>She paused. ''You know, it's really unbelievable in the 21st century. But the biggest problem in this country remains racism.''</p>
        <p>Still, with the Czech Republic's move toward the European Union, Ms. Horakova decided to sue in a civil court, for violation of her civic rights. Recently, she said, still delighted, the civil court agreed with her and awarded her damages from the club owner. If the money is finally paid, she said, she will give it to children's homes and hospitals.</p>
        <p>''This is a precedent for the Czech Republic,'' she said. ''I was -- God! -- I was very happy about it. It gave me a bit of hope that my children will live in a free country, in a country where you can get your rights.'' She stopped, quickly answering the imminent question, ''And I hope it's not just because I'm a member of Parliament.''</p>
        <p>Ondrej Gina, 49, who runs the Roma Cultural Union from a trailer in his hometown, Rokycany, is not so sure. He has brought many cases of discrimination against restaurant and bar owners but has never won.</p>
        <p>The Czech Republic has a big problem in its treatment of its 200,000 or so Gypsies, he says, and while policies are slowly improving in the capital, huge problems persist in the countryside.</p>
        <p>''I was born here, but the town doesn't like me,'' he said wryly. His relations with town hall are so bad that the mayor refuses to see him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gina started his protest activity in 1988, under the Communists, when he went on hunger strike for eight days. The next year, with the Velvet Revolution, he started a branch of the pro-democracy Civic Forum in Rokycany, a town near Pilsen with 13,500 people, about 800 Gypsies among them -- 90 percent of whom are unemployed.</p>
        <p>Open discrimination in public places and restaurants is common, he said. ''It's illegal, but the town silently tolerates it, or says it's a problem for the restaurant owners.''</p>
        <p>For five years, he has been engaged in a court case against one  restaurant. Local courts throw out his case. Higher courts, when he appeals, send the case back down for another round. His goal, he says, is to get the state prosecutor to enforce the article in the criminal code that forbids such discrimination.</p>
        <p>''I want the precedent,'' he said. Asked about Ms. Horakova's case in civil court, he said: ''In civil court, we bring the case as individuals. I want the state to do it.''</p>
        <p>He has even had an American-style sit-in, with the press invited. ''But nobody would serve us,'' he said. ''The staff just walked around.''</p>
        <p>Part of his problem with the mayor stems from a 1997 meeting on housing, when city officials would not talk to the Gypsies as a group, but only as individuals. The Gypsies lay on the floor and would not leave. The police came and filmed the protest, Mr. Gina said. ''Then they showed it on television, to show the whole nation what a mess the Roma can make when they are allowed to meet with public officials,'' he said. ''Now the mayor says he'll never negotiate with Gina again.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gina has another reason to be proud. His son, Ondrej Gina Jr., 29, is the first Gypsy news announcer on the nightly prime-time state television news.</p>
        <p>Instead of going to college, ''I was trained to be a cook and a waiter, but I never worked in this field,'' the younger Mr. Gina said, smiling. ''It didn't interest me.''</p>
        <p>What has shaped his life is having his father as a model, he said. ''Everything I have in me I have thanks to him.'' But he also took advantage of Communism's fall, working for a nongovernmental foundation and then leaving, in 1992, for Germany, where he worked for a Gypsy group run by one of the few radical Gypsy advocates, Rudko Kawczynski.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gina was a press officer for three years, became interested in journalism and then was chosen to study at the Council of Europe and the Central European University in Budapest, financed by George Soros. Hired by Czech Radio in 1998, Mr. Gina did so well that a television producer asked him to try television, and he quickly became an anchor.</p>
        <p>''Viewers reacted very positively to seeing a Romany on the screen,'' he said. ''I was pleasantly surprised. Of course, I received some negative letters as well, but everyone has the right to an opinion, right?''</p>
        <p>To his proud father, the television job has helped all the Gypsies. ''It's made us more visible,'' he said. ''They can see a Romany on television every day. And I think it surprised a lot of people. The idea still prevails that Roma can only work with their hands and a shovel.'' And Gypsies themselves started watching the news.</p>
        <p>The elder Mr. Gina has seen the sharp change from Communism, when life for most Gypsies was better here, if only because they had jobs and income. The goal of the Communist state was assimilation, ''to turn us into working socialist citizens of Gypsy origin,'' he said. That meant the repression of language, songs and culture, as well as a controversial birth-control program involving paid sterilization.</p>
        <p>But it also meant a certain legal equality, guaranteed jobs, however poor, and the repression of overt racism. Skinheads and neo-fascists are post-Communist phenomena, Mr. Gina said.</p>
        <p>The government was slow to take these seriously, he said, and then worried about the country's image. Political parties ''sensed the negative sentiment toward Roma and were afraid they would lose voters if they pressed Roma issues, so they played it both ways, doing enough to have something to say abroad, but not to do so much as to lose votes.''</p>
        <p>But with a recent wave of criticism from the United States Congress, the State Department and the European Union about Gypsy policies here -- beginning with negative human-rights reports in 1997 -- the Czech government began to deal more seriously with a worsening situation.</p>
        <p>Some Gypsies had been killed by skinheads, unemployment among Gypsies was skyrocketing, the percentage of Gypsy children put into special schools for the retarded -- after taking tests tilted toward Czech language and culture -- had increased. ''They could no longer ignore it or talk around it,'' Mr. Gina said. ''Now they admit that racism and discrimination are big problems in the Czech Republic, and they are beginning to do something about it.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, he said, the Gypsies have learned to organize and to publicize their grievances, not just here but abroad. There are more indigenous Czech foundations involved with helping Gypsies, not just foreign organizations like Mr. Soros's Open Society Institute, which helps Mr. Gina's organization.</p>
        <p>But there is also too much paternalism, Ms. Horakova said, with too many Czechs who speak no Romany making a living by helping a people they do not understand, while Gypsies themselves go jobless. ''I call it the Roma industry,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Now, under pressure, the government is moving to create fairer tests for children that do not depend so much on Czech-language skills and culture. Because of a change Ms. Horakova initiated in the law, entrance into secondary school is now  by examination, open to anyone, even those assigned to the special schools.</p>
        <p>The younger Mr. Gina thinks that life is slowly improving here, that the new openness must eventually filter down from the capital to the countryside. ''There are still many xenophobes,'' he said. ''But many people realize there is a problem that needs to be solved. I consider the Czech Republic my homeland. I couldn't live anywhere else.''</p>
        <p>For Ms. Horakova, there is still the sense of a double life, in the outer world and in the Gypsy one, but she enjoys the tension.</p>
        <p>''I'm a great example of integration here, but I didn't know how to describe it,'' she said. ''Then a friend told me, 'You have a permanent oscillation between Czech and Roma culture.' It's true. Sometimes in an hour, I can switch between thinking in Romany and thinking in Czech. It gives me a richer life.''</p>
        <p>''I'm proud I'm Roma, and we're a part of this nation,'' she said. ''It's not about chauvinism. But you must never bow your head.''</p>
