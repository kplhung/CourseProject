        <p>A PALACE was not a palace without a patio in the days of Don Pedro Fajardo y Chacon, the Castilian nobleman who built the Castle of Velez Blanco near the southeastern coast of Spain between 1506 and 1515.

        <p>Now fast-forward from the 16th to the 20th century and to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where, by one of those happy sets of circumstances that often befall the Met, the Velez Blanco Patio was installed in 1964. A treasure in its own right, it also serves as a grand entrance to the Thomas J. Watson Library and as a showcase for the museum's collection of Italian Renaissance statuary, including Tullio Lombardo's ''Adam'' (circa 1490-95), an early Renaissance example of a heroic nude.</p>

        <p>A PALACE was not a palace without a patio in the days of Don Pedro Fajardo y Chacon, the Castilian nobleman who built the Castle of Velez Blanco near the southeastern coast of Spain between 1506 and 1515. The crowning glory of his Gothic abode was its patio, an ensemble that mated local Gothic and Spanish-Moorish structural elements with architectural and decorative components from the Italian Renaissance.</p>
        <p>Now fast-forward from the 16th to the 20th century and to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where, by one of those happy sets of circumstances that often befall the Met, the Velez Blanco Patio was installed in 1964. A treasure in its own right, it also serves as a grand entrance to the Thomas J. Watson Library and as a showcase for the museum's collection of Italian Renaissance statuary, including Tullio Lombardo's ''Adam'' (circa 1490-95), an early Renaissance example of a heroic nude.</p>
        <p>The courtyard, closed for refurbishing in 1997, reopens today, and is more its 16th-century self than in many years. Its delicate carvings, modeled on monuments of Roman antiquity, have been meticulously cleaned; more sophisticated lighting has been installed; and greater authenticity has been achieved by a new floor of white Macael marble, styled like the patio's original paving and taken from the same quarry. The big Fajardo coat of arms, formerly under the arcade, has been reinstalled in a more visible position, high on the patio's west wall.</p>
        <p>On the east wall is a richly colored Flemish tapestry of early Renaissance vintage, ''The Triumph of Fame,'' thought to have once been owned by Queen Isabella of Spain and recently acquired by the Met. And the museum has seized the occasion to mount two temporary shows, ''Sculpture and Decorative Arts of the Spanish Renaissance'' and ''The Forgotten Friezes From the Castle of Velez Blanco.''</p>
        <p>The patio was originally built, at Don Pedro's behest, by an itinerant group of Northern Italian sculptors and artisans who carved its 2,000-odd marble parts and worked them into a graceful ensemble of arcaded galleries, capitals, windows and door frames that is considered one of the jewels of early Renaissance Spain. But by the early 19th century, after decades of political unrest, the castle was abandoned, and at the turn of the 20th its owners sold the intact patio to a Parisian dealer.</p>
        <p>In search of a centerpiece for his own castle going up at Park Avenue and 67th Street, the investment banker and art collector George Blumenthal bought the patio in 1913. Later, from 1934 to 1941, he served as president of the Met and bequeathed it his prize. In 1945, four years after his death, his house was razed, and the patio was dismantled and shipped in blocks to the Met.</p>
        <p>It lay in storage until 1963, when, after a five-year research project by Olga Raggio, now chairman of the Met's department of European sculpture and decorative arts, it was reassembled at its present site. Two extra arches and some modernities added during the Blumenthal restoration were tossed out, and voila! In the words of Ms. Raggio, who has also supervised the latest restoration, a monument was returned to life.</p>
        <p>The show on the patio's balcony, ''The Forgotten Friezes From the Castle of Velez Blanco,'' adds another twist to the monument's lengthy saga. In 1992 the removal of an old heating system at the Museum of Decorative Arts in Paris uncovered crates containing 10 large horizontal reliefs, unopened since their arrival, by bequest, in 1905. Each relief is about 20 feet long and robustly carved in Scotch pine. Their subjects are the triumphs of Julius Caesar and the labors of Hercules, heroic ideals to which men of the Renaissance aspired.</p>
        <p>Research by Monique Blanc, curator of the department of medieval and Renaissance art at the Paris museum, established that the friezes, most with pieces missing, were made for the reception halls of the very same Velez Blanco castle from which the patio was stripped. Six of the panels -- three devoted to Caesar, three to Hercules -- are on view in the show.</p>
        <p>They are an impressive group, each panel squeezing a dense medley of images into its limited space. The fact that they lacked a religious theme, a rare circumstance in Roman Catholic Spain for works displayed so prominently, is seen as evidence of Don Pedro's preference for the classical tradition in which he was educated.</p>
        <p>The three friezes concerning Caesar depict his triumphal procession through Rome. In the most salient, a fierce-looking Caesar, waving a victory palm, rides on his chariot preceded by officials carrying the fasces of authority, musicians, a dancing jester and soldiers bearing booty. Behind him comes his horse, really a unicorn with human feet, and the beginning of a long procession of cavalry soldiers.</p>
        <p>The strongest of the Herculean friezes illustrates the super-baby in his cradle strangling serpents sent by the goddess Hera to destroy him, slaying the redoubtable Nemean lion that had been ravaging the countryside and dispatching a three-headed monster named Cacus who stole cattle that Hercules had liberated from a three-bodied giant named Geryon.</p>
        <p>The two sets of friezes are stylistically different: the Herculean figures are more naturalistic than the Caesarean and closer to late Gothic in their landscape, composition and narrative structure than to the Renaissance mode of the Caesar reliefs. Their compositional density does not make for easy reading, but the challenge is worthwhile.</p>
        <p>The other show, of 65 Spanish Renaissance sculptures and decorative objects installed in a small gallery right off the patio's main floor, includes many items from the Met's collections that have not been publicly displayed before. Polychrome figures and reliefs, glass and lusterware, church silver, metalwork, tiles and a rare pair of tapestries from a set of 10 illustrating events during the Catholic reconquest of Spain by Ferdinand and Isabella give an idea of the cross-cultural influences on Spanish art by Muslims and Western Europeans.</p>
        <p>Standout sculptures include a Spanish Pieta from the first half of the 16th century, delicately carved in alabaster with traces of polychromy, notable for the mingled expression of horror and pity on the Virgin's face. ''The Holy Family With SS. Anne and Joachim'' (1567-68), a relief in wood by Diego de Pesquera, beautifully exemplifies the Spanish technique of estofado, in which gilt and polychromy play off each other in complex patterning.</p>
        <p>And a later, startlingly realistic life-size statue of St. John the Baptist (early 17th century) by Juan Martinez Montanes departs innovatively from the estofado technique by the use of a more natural polychrome finish.</p>
        <p>In the small selection of silver liturgical articles, an elaborate mid-17th-century monstrance -- designed to protect and display the consecrated wafer at Mass -- immediately strikes the eye.</p>
        <p>Of silver gilt with applied enamels, it is attributed to Diego de Atienza, a Spaniard active in Peru, who made it for a friar in Lima. Its lower half is more in the austere early 17th-century style of Philip II in Spain, but the elaborately rayed nimbus, or sol,  containing a glass compartment for the wafer, is much more extravagant, anticipating later Peruvian developments.</p>
        <p>One of the most characteristically Spanish arts is wrought iron, of which there are a few good examples here, though not enough. A fine 17th-century grille of wrought iron and bronze by Francisco Gonzales repeats elegantly proportioned skinny spindles for decorative effect; a 17th-century drop-front desk of carved and gilded bone and wrought iron with intricate geometrical patterning shows the lingering influence of Islamic design.</p>
        <p>Plates, bowls, vases and other examples of lusterware, a type of tin-glazed earthenware imitating Chinese porcelains, range from refined to folksy. On the more restrained side is a double-handled water bottle from Valencia (first half of the 16th century) whose allover floral pattern is bordered by Moorish geometrics. But there is naive exuberance in the treatment given a dish whose crudely drawn image of the Christ child displays symbols of the Passion on a band down the front of his robe.</p>
        <p>Glassmaking, an Andalusian specialty in Renaissance Spain later refined by the immigration of Venetians to Catalonia, is represented by a number of ebullient pieces, notable for their florid design with lots of swirls and loopy handles. Among the flasks, bowls, decanters and vases is a plain cow from the 17th century, of pale pinkish glass tinged with purple, probably inspired by the Muslim dromedary flasks then popular in Spain.</p>
        <p>All in all, a fine introduction to early Spanish culture.</p>
        <p>The reopening of the Velez Blanco Patio at the Metropolitan Museum of Art coincides with two exhibitions, ''The Forgotten Friezes From the Castle of Velez Blanco'' and ''Sculpture and Decorative Arts of the Spanish Renaissance,'' both on view through Jan. 7 at the museum, on Fifth Avenue at 81st Street, (212) 535-7710.</p>
