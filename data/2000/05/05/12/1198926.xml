        <p>'Chapter and Verse'</p>
        <p>Casey Kaplan</p>
        <p>416 West 14th Street, Chelsea</p>
        <p>Through May 20</p>
        <p>Amy Adler's subtle, cerebral, sometimes awkward-looking art has become clearer, more fluid and emotionally deeper. Her new images -- cinematic sequences of herself reading, writing or talking -- add elements of film and performance to her fusion of drawing and photography, and they wear their contradictions on their sleeves.</p>
        <p>They first suggest big pastels, firmly drawn, with robust textures and crosshatching. But the gleaming laminated surfaces indicate that the image is not a drawing but a photograph of a drawing made from a photograph. In typical Adler fashion, both the initial photograph and the hand-drawn copy have been destroyed, leaving the photograph of the copy as a unique artwork. This conceptual strategy, while interesting, is outweighed by the slightly larger-than-life images themselves.</p>

        <p>'Chapter and Verse'</p>

        <p>Amy Adler's subtle, cerebral, sometimes awkward-looking art has become clearer, more fluid and emotionally deeper. Her new images -- cinematic sequences of herself reading, writing or talking -- add elements of film and performance to her fusion of drawing and photography, and they wear their contradictions on their sleeves.</p>
        <p>They first suggest big pastels, firmly drawn, with robust textures and crosshatching. But the gleaming laminated surfaces indicate that the image is not a drawing but a photograph of a drawing made from a photograph. In typical Adler fashion, both the initial photograph and the hand-drawn copy have been destroyed, leaving the photograph of the copy as a unique artwork. This conceptual strategy, while interesting, is outweighed by the slightly larger-than-life images themselves.</p>
        <p>In a sequence of 12 white-on-black images, Ms. Adler stands and speaks, her mouth opening and closing, her hands moving up and down. In a six-image piece in color, she writes in a notebook, pausing to shape a word with her hand or mouth, gestures most writers will recognize. In another six-image work, also in color, she sits reading aloud from a book, as if rehearsing a script.</p>
        <p>The ease with which these still, silent images imply sound and movement is remarkable, as is their collapsing of drawing, photography and film. But most remarkable of all is the way they show a woman simply, calmly, assertively engaged in various acts of self-expression. Expression of the self has always been at the core of Ms. Adler's work, often stated in sexual terms. Here, in her best New York show, she does it with a simplicity and a universality that speak directly to the heart.</p>
