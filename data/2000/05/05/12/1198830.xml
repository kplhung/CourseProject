        <p>Setting the stage for a major vote on Friday on a new presidential primary system, a Republican committee acted today to give its national party new authority to make rules and punish states if they break them.</p>
        <p>The Rules Committee of the Republican National Committee will vote on Friday on a plan to have the smallest states hold their primaries first and have the biggest states go last, a proposal by Bill Brock, a former senator and party chairman, designed to maintain voter interest throughout the primaries. Mr. Brock said tonight that he expected the plan to be adopted.</p>
        <p>That plan, which Mr. Brock said would give lesser-known candidates with smaller financial resources a better chance to compete for the nomination, was hotly debated tonight.</p>
        <p>Mike Hellon of Arizona argued: ''If you don't get out ahead of the process, you're going to get rolled over by it. This is the time to show some leadership.''</p>
        <p>Diana Adams of Indiana, where the primary came after the nominations were decided on March 7, said, ''We ate everybody's dust.''</p>
        <p>But Barbara Alby of California complained: ''The states at the end of the calendar would never have a chance to influence the process.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Alby said the press would declare someone a winner before then, even if no one had the majority of delegates. Under the plan, 12 big states with about 47 percent of all delegates would vote last.</p>
        <p>Another speaker for a late state, Bill Powers of New York, cited ''states' rights,'' saying ''let the states pick the dates.''</p>
        <p>If the proposal is adopted by the committee, it then goes to the full national committee, where chairman Jim Nicholson supports the Brock plan, and then to the national convention, where big states wary of the plan have great voting strength.</p>
        <p>Even so, today's votes marked a significant change in Republican attitudes, as showed by the complaints of committee members on the losing side.</p>
        <p>Ms. Alby objected, ''We are not a party that operates as a top down, command and control model.''</p>
        <p>Morton Blackwell of Virginia said it was a conservative principle that ''concentration and control of power in the national party should be avoided wherever possible.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hellon said that party rules, even the modest ones already in force, would be ''irrelevant and academic'' without enforcement powers.</p>
        <p>David Norcross of New Jersey argued for giving party leaders the flexibility to change the rules between conventions. Without the hope of negotiating any compromise with Democrats, which that flexibility would allow, he said, ''We are going very, very shortly to be facing a national primary.''</p>
        <p>The rules committee decided today to allow the full national committee to strip states of up to 90 percent of their delegates if they held their primaries or caucuses earlier than the rules allowed.</p>
        <p>The rules committee also decided to allow the national committee, until Feb. 1 of the year before a presidential election, to change the rules about the timing of primaries. Now only the Republican convention can change those rules.</p>
