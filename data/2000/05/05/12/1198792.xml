        <p>The president of the United Steelworkers of America, one of the nation's most powerful trade unions, said today that organized labor's support for Vice President Al Gore could be hurt by his recent lobbying for the China trade deal.</p>
        <p>George Becker, the Steelworkers' president, who played a pivotal role in getting the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to endorse the vice president, said he was angry that Mr. Gore was lobbying hard for the China deal after telling labor leaders that his views on trade would differ from President Clinton's.</p>

        <p>The president of the United Steelworkers of America, one of the nation's most powerful trade unions, said today that organized labor's support for Vice President Al Gore could be hurt by his recent lobbying for the China trade deal.</p>
        <p>George Becker, the Steelworkers' president, who played a pivotal role in getting the A.F.L.-C.I.O. to endorse the vice president, said he was angry that Mr. Gore was lobbying hard for the China deal after telling labor leaders that his views on trade would differ from President Clinton's.</p>
        <p>''We are not going to be forgiving on this,'' Mr. Becker said. ''Our members are not.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Becker declined to say what action, if any, his union might take because of its unhappiness with Mr. Gore's trade stance, but he said the vice president's position might alienate many supporters in his union.</p>
        <p>Most labor leaders have not publicly criticized Mr. Gore's support of the deal, which calls for permanently normalizing trade relations with China. Many labor leaders say that while they disagree with the vice president, they agree with him on most other issues and do not want to undercut his chances in November.</p>
        <p>Organized labor has made defeating the bill its top legislative priority, arguing that it would be wrong to normalize relations with a country where there are widespread human rights and labor rights violations.</p>
        <p>Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for the Gore campaign, said the vice president is sympathetic to the Steelworkers' concerns and plans to continue working with the labor movement on a range of issues that affect working families. ''At the same time, he's been very clear about his position on this issue from the day he was endorsed by the A.F.L.-C.I.O. last October,'' Mr. Hattaway said. ''He believes the agreement is good for workers and good for the economy.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Becker made his remarks on a day when President Clinton predicted that the House would approve the China deal. Mr. Clinton told a radio interviewer, ''I think we'll get the votes, because I think it's the right thing for the country.''</p>
        <p>The House is scheduled to vote on the China bill the week of May 22, and the Senate, which lawmakers say will easily approve the measure, is expected to vote next month.</p>
        <p>Republican leaders in the House sought yesterday to bolster support for the bill by saying they were likely to back a bipartisan proposal that would set up a commission to monitor human rights in China. Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, an Illinois Republican, and Majority Leader Dick Armey, a Texas Republican, said they were close to a deal that would enable them to support the proposal.</p>
        <p>Representative Sander M. Levin, a Michigan Democrat, working closely with Representative Doug Bereuter, a Nebraska Republican, proposed such a commission as a way to secure more backing for the trade deal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Becker said he believed that the China bill would have a far more difficult chance of gaining House approval if Mr. Gore were not lobbying for it. ''This is a pretty close vote, and if he makes the difference in this, and we lose, I think there'll be a hell of a price to pay,'' Mr. Becker said.</p>
        <p>At the A.F.L.-C.I.O. convention last October, he said, many labor leaders felt more confident about endorsing Mr. Gore after he promised, if elected, to place more emphasis on worker rights in negotiating trade agreements than President Clinton has.</p>
        <p>''I would have expected him under the circumstances to keep out of the way on this,'' Mr. Becker said. ''He's twisting arms. He's putting himself in a position where he's directly opposed to where we're going.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Becker voiced a concern that many labor leaders have been murmuring for weeks. Many say they are finding it hard to excite union members to vote for and campaign for Mr. Gore when he is battling them on labor's No. 1 legislative issue.</p>
        <p>One House Democrat whom Mr. Gore has lobbied, Bob Clement of Tennessee, announced today that he would vote against the China bill. Another Democrat, Juanita Millender-McDonald of California, also announced her opposition. But Representative Ken Bentsen, a Texas Democrat, announced his support for the bill, saying he was encouraged by a White House plan to set up a commission that would study the problems of displaced workers.</p>
        <p>Some opponents assert that Mr. Gore is lobbying so hard to show that he is willing to take a stand unpopular with many supporters.</p>
        <p>In an interview with Diane Rehm, a Washington-based talk-show host, Mr. Clinton said yesterday that Mr. Gore's stance on China would help the vice president politically.</p>
        <p>''Even though some of the strongest elements of the Democratic Party and some of our best friends are on the other side of this fight, it shows he's willing to take an independent stand to do what he believes is right,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
