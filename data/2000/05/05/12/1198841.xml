        <p>Panel of undecided voters who have been sharing their views on New York State Senate race with New York Times say that public unraveling of Mayor Giuliani's marriage, his pained announcement of a separation and his wife's accusations of another relationship and her failed effort at reconciliation, resolves matter for these voters; they say that Giuliani's behavior either disgusts them, shows he is not seriously interested in being senator, or ends his viability as candidate (M)</p>

        <p>''I'm x-ing him out, I really am.''</p>
        <p>''What planet does he come from?''</p>
        <p>''Stick a fork in him; he's done.''</p>
        <p>These are comments from a panel of voters who have been sharing their views on the Senate race with The New York Times. Until yesterday, all were undecided, part of a tiny but crucial minority who had yet to choose between Rudolph W. Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>But the public unraveling of Mayor Giuliani's marriage, his pained announcement of a separation and his wife's accusations of another relationship and her failed effort at reconciliation, resolved the matter for many of these voters. The mayor's behavior, they said, either disgusted them, showed he was not seriously interested in being a senator or ended his viability as a candidate.</p>
        <p>Their reactions, while not unanimous, were heartfelt. They were not  based on whether the Giuliani marriage had failed or whether the mayor had been unfaithful, but rather on the way he had disclosed their possible separation without alerting his wife, Donna Hanover.</p>
        <p>''If you're trying to work on something with your wife and you stab her in the back, what does that say about your character?'' asked Thomas Beck, a Long Island guidance counselor. ''Donna Hanover had great dignity by not airing anything in the past. She could have put a big hurt on him, but she kept it to herself.''</p>
        <p>''He's abrasive, as we all know,'' Mr. Beck continued. ''He's callous in many ways. He looks down on the downtrodden of New York. It's one thing after another with this guy. I tried to overlook a lot of things. But I'm x-ing him out now, I really am.''</p>
        <p>Doug Taggart, vice president of a financial service firm in Manhattan, also spoke of the mayor's crowning disregard of his wife, after years of estrangement. ''He didn't even take the time to call her and say we need to talk'' before making his announcement, Mr. Taggart said, noting that in business such behavior would signal ''a lack of relationship management skills.'' Mr. Taggart also observed that the mayor seemed to have ''a political death wish,'' which may ''confirm that he isn't interested in being a senator.'' All in all,  ''Stick a fork in him; he's done.''</p>
        <p>Of the 11 voters that The Times is following (four of them unavailable yesterday) only Bob and Cathy Harrison from upstate New York thought Mr. Giuliani remained an attractive, viable candidate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harrison, a high school history teacher, said that the separation was 'expected'' given the mayor's bold forays in public with his female companion, Judith Nathan, and Ms. Hanover's absence from events on the campaign trail or at City Hall, including the recent press conference when Mr. Giuliani revealed he had prostate cancer.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Harrison's view, declaring the marriage over now was wise timing. It took advantage of any sympathy engendered by the cancer diagnosis, he said, and also avoided more damage later.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Harrison, a nurse, hoped, that Mr. Giuliani would remain in the race. And she argued that the mayor may even have been justified in seeking the company of another woman who ''he could rely on to help him through this cancer thing.''</p>
        <p>It is a truism of marriage, she said, that nobody else knows what goes on behind closed doors. ''Maybe he needs some comfort right now and she's not that type of person,'' Mrs. Harrison said of Ms. Hanover. ''And maybe she's trying to be loving and he's pushing her away.''</p>
        <p>The upstate voters, predictably, knew less of the he-said, she-said of the Giuliani marriage.</p>
        <p>Charlene Clinton, a school aide in Buffalo, was unaware of the mayor's cancer or his marital problems and assumed, when asked, that the split was between President and Hillary Clinton. But once up to speed, Ms. Clinton was unsparing: ''What planet does he come from?'' she said. ''Letching around with all these different people -- that's too much scandal for me.''</p>
        <p>It was not scandal that troubled Tom Smith, who works in a Wal-Mart in Kingston. ''There's too much on his plate right now to try to be a senator, especially a new one,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Series So Far</p>
        <p>This is the fourth article in a series following a group of New York State voters from diverse backgrounds as they make up their minds on which candidate to support for the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>The previous articles were about Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's prostate cancer, the information already available about the candidates and the voters' first impressions.</p>
