        <p>The Clinton administration, responding to a detailed public warning by China against national missile defenses proposed by Washington, said today that it believed Beijing would go ahead with modernizing its nuclear forces even if Washington were not planning the new system.</p>
        <p>''Whether or not we proceed with national missile defense, China's nuclear forces would expand in a way that would make this system less threatening to China,'' said a senior administration official who briefed reporters on arms control at the State Department.</p>
        <p>The official, an expert in arms control, sounded an apparently conciliatory note by saying that while the administration had explained to China that the proposed system was designed to defend against rogue states like North Korea and not against China, there had been insufficient discussion with Beijing.</p>
        <p>''We haven't had the kind of deep national security or international security dialogue with China that we would like to have for the last couple of years because of the continuing fallout from the embassy bombing,'' the official said, referring to the American strike against the Chinese embassy in Belgrade last May during the air war over Kosovo.</p>
        <p>In an interview on Wednesday in Beijing, China's chief arms negotiator, Sha Zukang, said that if Washington proceeded with deployment of the missile defenses, ''we will not sit on our hands.'' He described the missile program as a threat to China's security and outlined several possible responses, including producing more nuclear warheads and devising ways to erode the effectiveness of the defense with decoys.</p>
        <p>On Capitol Hill, the strongest proponents of a missile system interpreted Mr. Sha's warnings as confirmation of the need to proceed with the program.</p>
        <p>The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Jesse Helms, Republican of North Carolina, who favors a more robust program than the version now under discussion, questioned how China could criticize the program.</p>
        <p>''After issuing nuclear threat after nuclear threat, China now has the nerve to complain that a U.S. missile defense is a threat to their security?'' he asked. ''To the contrary, leaving the American people vulnerable to Beijing's nuclear blackmail is a threat to U.S. national security.''</p>
        <p>Another proponent of the missile project, Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, said he regretted that Mr. Sha had interpreted the system as a threat to China. ''This or any other system is purely defensive in nature,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Administration officials have only recently focused on China's concerns about the missile program. Japan and Australia, Washington's allies in the Pacific, have expressed concern that the system will unsettle the relationship between the United States and China.</p>
        <p>After President Clinton announced in January 1999 that under certain conditions he would seek to deploy the missile defenses, the administration paid most attention to Russia. For the system to go ahead, the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty signed by the United States and the Soviet Union needs to be amended.</p>
        <p>In a trip to Beijing earlier this year, Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and other senior officials sought to explain to the Chinese, including Mr. Sha, that the system was not a threat to China and was not being built because of concerns about China.</p>
        <p>But according to several accounts, the Chinese found the American arguments unconvincing.</p>
        <p>This was in large part because China, unlike Russia, does not have a large nuclear arsenal capable of overwhelming the limited program proposed by the administration.</p>
        <p>China's nuclear capacity would be sharply limited even by the limited system that Washington is now planning. Western experts estimate that China has 13 to 20 land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, with one warhead each.</p>
        <p>The administration official who briefed reporters today said China had maintained ''a very small force level of some 20, roughly, ICBM's.''</p>
        <p>A spirited debate has been under way in the intelligence community in the past year about China's nuclear missile plans and what role Washington's missile proposal is playing in the development of those plans.</p>
        <p>Some experts believe that a national missile defense would encourage China to speed up its modernization effort in ways that it would not otherwise consider.</p>
        <p>Among the steps China would be likely to take is the building of missiles capable of carrying many warheads, each capable of being programmed to hit separate targets, according to Jonathan Pollack, an expert on the Chinese military at the Rand Corporation.</p>
