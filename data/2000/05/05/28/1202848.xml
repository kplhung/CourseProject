        <p>A LITTLE more than a year ago, Dr. Joshua Lipsman left Alexandria, Va., where he had been health commissioner for seven years, to become executive director of the Manhattan-based Gay Men's Health Crisis, the nation's oldest and largest AIDS services agency.</p>
        <p>But after just 10 months on the job, marked by severe budget problems and political infighting, Dr. Lipsman has returned to the field of public health as Westchester's new health commissioner.</p>
        <p>''I just plunged into this maelstrom of discontent and unhappiness, on top of the already sad and hard situation called AIDS,'' Dr. Lipsman said.</p>
        <p>The agency had already gone through three downsizings -- eliminating programs and laying people off -- when Dr. Lipsman discovered a $2.5 million budget shortfall. The staff became disillusioned at the prospect of further cuts, and Dr. Lipsman said he became ''the lightning rod'' for criticism.</p>
        <p>The financial crisis was caused by the changing demographics of AIDS, Dr. Lipsman said. It no longer strikes primarily gay white men -- traditional donors to the group -- but has moved into poor minority groups. At the same time, new drugs are prolonging the lives of many people with AIDS -- increasing demand for the agency's services.</p>
        <p>There were also political problems. Dr. Lipsman angered members of the gay community by supporting a state law requiring AIDS patients to report the names of their sexual partners. He said the issue was one of the few on which activists and public health officials disagreed. The decision for Dr. Lipsman to leave was mutual, he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lipsman, who is gay, said he was pleased that his new post is in ''a politically progressive community.'' But he added that working in the public sector was different from working for an agency.</p>
        <p>''As someone who is in charge of the health department for the entire county of Westchester, it's important that I remain neutral in terms of my personal identification,'' Dr. Lipsman said. ''I am the health commissioner for everyone, male and female, gay and straight, black and white.''</p>
        <p>Susan Tolchin, a spokeswoman for County Executive Andrew J. Spano, said of Dr. Lipsman: ''His life style was never an issue. He was hired because of his background in public health. We did a nationwide search, and he was at the top of everyone's list.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Lipsman said one of his first priorities as commissioner would be working on the West Nile virus. He also intends to focus his efforts on preventing smoking, which Dr. Lipsman said was the single most preventable cause of death and disease.</p>
        <p>''My philosophy,'' he said, ''is that we need to pay attention to the diseases that are either the most deadly or affect the greatest number of cases.''</p>
        <p>The West Nile virus, which is carried by mosquitoes, is frightening because it is unpredictable and can be lethal. Dr. Lipsman said he hoped to avoid aerial spraying of pesticides. Instead, he plans to focus his department's efforts on prevention -- by educating the public about emptying standing water on their property and using larvicide in catch basins.</p>
        <p>He said that since the West Nile virus is so new -- it was only seen in this hemisphere for the first time last year and there has yet to be a full season of it in Westchester -- he wanted to proceed cautiously. ''We could have an outcome which ranges from a very relaxed summer with little, if any, activity, or we could have a case number that is larger than last year,'' he said. ''We have no way of knowing.'' As with other diseases carried by insects, like tick-borne Lyme and Erlichiosis, the Health Department will urge traditional precautions like the use of insect repellent and covering exposed flesh.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lipsman said it was a particularly exciting time to be working on antismoking measures, because money from the tobacco settlement is trickling down to the county.</p>
        <p>Environmental health will also be a focus,  with special attention given to reducing the use of pesticides. ''You can make people as healthy as you want, but if you're living in an environment that is unhealthy, it kind of undoes all that good work,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lipsman, who began his new job this month, runs a department of 400 employees with a budget of $125 million this year. He replaced Dr. Harold N. Adel, who retired in January. Though now living in Manhattan, Dr. Lipsman plans to move to the county, where he hopes to indulge his love of sailing. He said he also likes exercising, reading and attending plays and the opera.</p>
        <p>''Working in Westchester is tremendously exciting and appealing,'' he said. ''It has all the key ingredients -- public health problems that are complex and challenging, as well as the financial resources and the will to address these needs.''</p>
