        <p>FOR 18 years, the blue and white Star of David snapped over the crumbling ramparts of Beaufort Castle, the Crusader stronghold commanding the folding ravines and abrupt gullies that twist through southern Lebanon and northern Israel.</p>
        <p>The 12th century fortress has endured as a symbol of power, for whoever ruled its battlements could rain destruction in any direction.</p>
        <p>But in the two decades since Israel invaded Lebanon to dislodge the Palestinians, such direct power has proved elusive in the rugged southern Lebanese countryside. For all its physical presence in the south, Israel was unable to ever bring the region completely to heel. So now it has taken a grand gamble: that by simply leaving southern Lebanon -- and, at least for now, turning it over to Israel's bitterest enemies -- it will be better positioned to pursue a broader strategic peace.</p>
        <p>And on its northern border, the linchpin of that peace is not in Lebanon's small villages and rocky hills at all, but 40 miles away, in Damascus, Syria, the capital from which Israel assumes the Islamic guerrillas of Hezbollah can be controlled -- or set loose. It is Syria, after all, whose 35,000 troops have not relinquished a military embrace of Lebanon that dates from the Lebanese civil war in the 1970's.</p>
        <p>''Once Israel has withdrawn completely from Lebanese territory, then it is on a much higher political ground to justify retaliation for any attacks because it is no longer occupying foreign territory,'' said Edward P. Djerejian, a former American  ambassador to Syria and Israel. ''They are truly protecting their international border from within.''</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak has threatened to unleash Israel's full might against Syria in retaliation for any cross-border violence. ''Now a new dynamic is at work,'' said Itamar Rabinovich, who was Israel's chief negotiator with Syria from 1992 to 1996 while he was ambassador to Washington. When  Israeli troops were in Lebanon, he said, the force served as insulation -- a punching bag that Syria could hit just by giving a nod to Hezbollah. ''Everybody knew that the Syrians were indirectly responsible or encouraged the attacks, but they were not directly responsible,'' he said. ''Now there is a real danger that any attack on Israel proper would lead to a full collision between Israel and Syria.''</p>
        <p>When Israel captured Beaufort Castle from the Palestinians in 1982, the architect of the invasion, Ariel Sharon, told Israeli reporters that the castle  had been taken without a single casualty. A young lieutenant stepped forward to say that actually six men were killed. It was an early portent that the cost of keeping an army in Lebanon would prove far higher than anticipated. Ultimately, Israel lost more than 900 men -- the last at Beaufort Castle on Feb. 11. Lebanese casualties were in the thousands.</p>
        <p>But all that bloodshed left little imprint on the larger issues of peace with Syria. Despite all the fighting between proxies, the main issue -- control of the Golan Heights -- simply wasn't addressed.</p>
        <p>Syria has kept its own border with Israel quiet since 1974, and a big Israeli hope is, obviously, that Damascus might keep Lebanon equally calm now in hopes of regaining the Golan Heights. Also, with an impending transition of power from President Hafez al-Assad to his son, Syria may well not want a new fight.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Syria's status as Lebanon's puppeteer has just become harder to justify with the Israeli occupation over. Still, the Syrians have said a struggle against Israel must continue as long as issues like the future of Palestinian refugees in Syria and Lebanon remain unresolved. And that touches on one of the most problematic aspects of the Israeli gamble: In the Middle East it is impossible to dismiss the ability of any one fringe group to ignite the center.</p>
        <p>One of the most prominent flags replacing the Star of David at Beaufort is yellow, with a fist hoisting a rifle over broad green Arabic letters spelling Hezbollah. This militia, with its strong ties to Syria and Iran, didn't even exist in 1982. Israel invaded Lebanon that year to eliminate the Palestinian movements then headquartered there and to install a puppet Christian government in Beirut. At first, southern Lebanon's Shiites, weary of the Palestinians' state within a state, welcomed the Israelis. But when Israel too proved highhanded, Shiite resentment blossomed. Hezbollah was born of a twin desire to drive out the Israelis and to gain some say in governing the Shiites' own land.</p>
        <p>Now Hezbollah represents the largest question hanging over the abrupt Israeli departure: whether, in the absence of any other force, it will bring quiet or will try to transfer the war of attrition across the border.</p>
        <p>Hezbollah has long been opaque about its intentions. Its rise was engineered in part by Iran, and those ties  remain close; Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharrazi, breezily swept through southern Lebanon last week. Still, Iran's most committed radicals are in a power struggle at home and may not want to meddle.</p>
        <p>HOW completely Iran or Syria can direct Hezbollah has always been unclear anyway. Now that the group has mastery of the south, there is an obvious temptation to feel a strong sense of autonomy. ''They have something to defend now,'' said Prof. Nubar Hovsepian, the assistant director of Middle East studies at Rutgers University. ''They are part of the Lebanese equation, not just a marginal presence. They have a stake in getting resources to build up the area of the country where the Shiite have a majority.''</p>
        <p>Southern Lebanon has long been poorand neglected. Hezbollah succeeded in no small part by providing  services in the area it controlled, and now that area has been vastly enlarged.</p>
        <p>Hezbollah also controls a few seats in Parliament, but far fewer than the older, more established Shiite party, Amal. Amal, too, lofted their flag above Beaufort last week. But it was the calm, methodical way in which Hezbollah exerted control over the south that was being most closely watched for a sign of how peace -- or new war -- might proceed.</p>
        <p>Among the original Crusaders who controlled Beaufort, Reynald of Sidon was known for charming Saladin, the most powerful regional military commander in the late 1100's. Reynald often used the front of extended peace talks to buy time to strengthen the castle's fortifications. Eventually Saladin tired of the game and laid siege until the place surrendered. It has been changing hands -- and defying the ambitions of conquerors -- ever since.</p>
