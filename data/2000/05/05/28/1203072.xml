        <p>It may seem obvious to those who call Bond Street home. But earlier this month, just to be sure, Mort Starobin printed out a simple plea and tacked it to trees along his leafy, residential block.</p>
        <p>''Please don't honk. We live here.''</p>
        <p>''It's out of control,'' said Mr. Starobin, who lives on the corner of Bond and Pacific Streets. ''We walk out of the house in the morning, and the drivers are furious about getting stuck out there. There is no traffic flow. They really hurt the quality of life here.''</p>
        <p>The problem, residents say, is that their street, which runs northbound, is a shortcut for drivers seeking to avoid the traffic on larger streets like Third Avenue. This includes truck drivers.</p>
        <p>''They get onto Bond and then find that they cannot turn onto any of the small streets,'' Mr. Starobin said. ''So they keep going and going all the way down to Atlantic Avenue,'' the only street large enough for some trucks to turn onto. ''Once they're in here it's like a maze,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Recently, construction along Atlantic Avenue has made matters worse by narrowing that street. As a result, large trucks get stuck at the corner, causing traffic snarls and, predictably, more honking.</p>
        <p>Although the city's Department of Transportation has not posted anti-honking signs, Mark Patterson, an agency spokesman, said, ''Drivers know it's against the law to blow their horns except in emergencies.'' He added that Bond Street was not on the Department of Transportation's list of truck routes.</p>
        <p>Eric Albert, a real estate agent who works in the area, said that while there were a couple of old ''no trucks'' signs, he had never seen either the no-trucks law or the no-honking law enforced. ''I saw an 18-wheeler do a U-turn on Atlantic Avenue,'' he added. ''I've never seen a cop give a guy a ticket.''</p>
        <p>Michelle Temple, a highway safety officer for the 84th Precinct, which includes that area of Bond Street, said she had not heard of any complaints about trucks on Bond Street. ''To my knowledge it's not a special-attention area,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Starobin, who recently bought an electronic noise-absorbing machine for his house, says his signs have helped. And the idea is catching on. ''Someone put up multicolored signs on Pacific Street,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The issue has also united neighbors on opposite sides of the street. ''We're thinking of putting a banner across the street from one building to another,'' Mr. Starobin said. ''I think with the signs up, people see that there are actually people who live here.''</p>
