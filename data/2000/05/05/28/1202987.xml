        <p>It has been a year since the Westchester Arts Council moved into the former Chase Manhattan Bank building on Mamaroneck Avenue in White Plains, amid hopes of livening up the declining neighborhood. Superficially, not much has changed, but the elegant brick and stone building now flies its cultural banners proudly.</p>
        <p>Artwork adorns the windows, and welcome signs invite the public to have a look. There will be plenty to see next Friday, Saturday and Sunday, when ''Open Studios 2000'' presents the work of nearly 200 Westchester artists throughout four floors of the building.</p>

        <p>It has been a year since the Westchester Arts Council moved into the former Chase Manhattan Bank building on Mamaroneck Avenue in White Plains, amid hopes of livening up the declining neighborhood. Superficially, not much has changed, but the elegant brick and stone building now flies its cultural banners proudly.</p>
        <p>Artwork adorns the windows, and welcome signs invite the public to have a look. There will be plenty to see next Friday, Saturday and Sunday, when ''Open Studios 2000'' presents the work of nearly 200 Westchester artists throughout four floors of the building.</p>
        <p>Last year the renovation was barely finished when the artists trouped in for a one-day celebratory show. With the raw spaces gone, this year's open studios exhibition, curated by Rosemary Erpf, is more orderly.</p>
        <p>On the ground floor, where tellers' booths and a vault beg for ironic attention, 50 invited artists will interpret the theme ''Glorification of the Commonplace.''</p>
        <p>Other work in all media (by anyone who applied on time) will be spread throughout the third and fifth floors and and will also be on view at the former First Union Bank building at 11 Mamaroneck Avenue.</p>
        <p>The real thing -- studios of artists renting space from the arts council -- will be available for viewing on the seventh floor.</p>
        <p>Artists will be present, works will be for sale and, at  the gala preview reception Friday, wine and food donated by nearby restaurants will be served.</p>
        <p>The hours are Friday from 6 to 9 p.m., $75 a person, and Saturday and Sunday from noon to 6 p.m., with a suggested donation of $5.</p>
        <p>For information, the number to call is 428-4220.</p>
