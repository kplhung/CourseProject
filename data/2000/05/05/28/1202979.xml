        <p>Eight months after tropical storm Floyd, the county will receive $1.5 million from the federal government for road repairs. Most of the money will reimburse the county for $1.4 million in repairs to the two-mile Seven Bridges Road in New Castle and Yorktown. The road was so badly damaged by the storm, which dumped 12 to 14 inches of rain on northern Westchester, that it was closed for four months. Westchester is still awaiting reimbursement for about $2 million in other storm-related damage, Budget Director Kathleen M. Carrano said. The largest claims involve damage to the bridge at Mountain Lakes Park in North Salem.</p>
