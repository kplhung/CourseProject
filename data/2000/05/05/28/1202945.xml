        <p>FOR the fans of Joni Mitchell, there could have been no more surprising news than to learn that the reclusive singer-songwriter was going on tour.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mitchell may be second only to Bob Dylan in having influenced more musicians than any other contemporary artist, inspiring such diverse on-the-record fans as Prince, Shawn Colvin and Madonna. She can also be credited -- or blamed -- for the glut of Lilith singer-songwriters from Sarah McLachlan to Alanis Morissette.</p>

        <p>FOR the fans of Joni Mitchell, there could have been no more surprising news than to learn that the reclusive singer-songwriter was going on tour.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mitchell may be second only to Bob Dylan in having influenced more musicians than any other contemporary artist, inspiring such diverse on-the-record fans as Prince, Shawn Colvin and Madonna. She can also be credited -- or blamed -- for the glut of Lilith singer-songwriters from Sarah McLachlan to Alanis Morissette.</p>
        <p>Most critics and fans would say that 1971's confessional ''Blue'' was Ms. Mitchell's most consequential recording, and many regard it as one of the greatest rock albums ever. But an argument can be made for the Grammy-winning ''Clouds,'' featuring the classics ''Both Sides Now'' and ''Chelsea Morning,'' the polished, jazzy ''Court and Spark'' and the revolutionary ''Hissing of Summer Lawns,'' on which she incorporated sampling, a decade before it became run-of-the-mill hip-hop fare. She even moved on to jazz, collaborating with Charlie Mingus. All 20 of her albums have been caught up in the swirl of constant re-invention, with each recording breaking new ground.</p>
        <p>In more recent years, while rutted in a jazz-rock style featuring too-familiar guitar tunings and Larry Klein's overwhelming sweeping bass, her music became less accessible and coherent than her earlier recordings. But that did not stop the respect for her artistry -- 1995's ''Turbulent Indigo'' won a Grammy award for Best Pop Album.</p>
        <p>Her songs ''Both Sides Now,'' ''Circle Game,'' ''Chelsea Morning,'' ''For Free,'' ''Woodstock,'' ''Free Man in Paris,'' ''Raised on Robbery,'' ''Case of You,'' ''Big Yellow Taxi,'' ''You Turn Me On, I'm a Radio'' and ''Help Me'' have become part of the canon of popular music.</p>
        <p>And now the usually secluded artist is becoming high-profile. A month ago, she reigned over a tribute concert to her featuring such artists as Elton John, Wynonna, Diana Krall and Cyndi Lauper. She also recently released an album of jazz and traditional pop standards, ''Both Sides Now,'' set to lush orchestration and featuring sultry remakes of her own classics ''A Case of You'' and the title track.</p>
        <p>The 56-year-old Ms. Mitchell, born Roberta Joan Anderson, grew up in the Canadian province of Alberta, where she internalized the bleak surroundings of the desolate land. After contracting polio as a child, she devoted her time to artwork and music. She studied commercial art in college, but her goals shifted as her interest in folk music grew, and she began performing in Toronto coffeehouses.</p>
        <p>In 1965, she married and moved to Detroit, where she performed on the local club circuit. Her marriage soon crumbled. But her reedy soprano and open-tuned guitar style gave her a national reputation. At a Miami performance, she met David Crosby, then a member of the Byrds, who helped her get a recording contract.</p>
        <p>In 1968, she released a striking debut, ''Song to a Seagull.'' It was highly anticipated because other artists had begun performing her material, including Judy Collins, who had a hit with ''Both Sides Now'' featured on her 1967 ''Wildflowers'' album.</p>
        <p>''Song to a Seagull'' featured refined folk melodies with erudite lyrics, foreboding harmonies and reverberating guitars. Her unique tunings and distinctively sweet vibrato adorned melancholy reflections on nature -- both human and environmental.</p>
        <p>A woman of ''heart and mind,'' Ms. Mitchell has spent her life as a devoted romantic, so much so that Rolling Stone once created a family tree to track her relationships, which included Graham Nash and James Taylor. She eventually married (and recently divorced) Larry Klein, the bassist with whom she still works.</p>
        <p>So it is no surprise that Ms. Mitchell would come full circle, to the song, and to a concert documenting the cycle of romance. After decades of treating audiences to her songcraft, it is time to treat them to her vocalizing. Always remaking herself, she has moved from creator to interpreter.</p>
        <p>This is a remarkable opportunity to see a musical icon in performance, but the repertory might not be for everyone. She is backed by an orchestra and several celebrated jazz friends, as she culls from the standards of America's pop-jazz elite like Billie Holiday, Nat King Cole and Lena Horne. She has collected a fine assortment of songs fitting with her romance-cycle motif. But while the songs have a wide range of themes, from the thrill of courtship to the chill of breakup, the slow-paced balladry gets tedious, and the desire to hear originals gets greater.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mitchell, a chain smoker, has lost a part of her distinctive higher range, but her lower register has gotten richer, deeper and more expressive. She is an excellent torch-singing stylist, extremely expressive, especially when performing her own material, which, in this setting, proves to be nothing short of brilliant.</p>
        <p>The highlight of the concert's first half (a full presentation of the ''Both Sides Now'' album), is the performance of her own two songs included on the album, which only whets the audience's appetite for more. The second half of the show revitalizes the crowd as she sings scorching versions of her own obscure gems like ''Hejira,'' ''Ludwig's Tune,'' and a riveting ''For The Roses.'' It is a rare musical evening.</p>
        <p>JONI MITCHELL</p>
        <p>Blockbuster Sony Entertainment Center,  Harbour Boulevard, Camden.  Friday at 8 p.m.  (609) 365-1300.</p>
