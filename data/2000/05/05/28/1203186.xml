        <p>It seemed an almost comic gamble, bringing red double-decker buses from Britain and setting them loose on New York.</p>
        <p>Not only was the man behind the idea, Harry Grant, a New Jersey developer, in bankruptcy proceedings, but New York in 1991 was saddled with a staggering crime rate and a sour economy. Times Square, where the buses were to pick up passengers, was a haven for vagrants and sleaze.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grant's leap across the Hudson River turned serendipitous. Crime rates fell. The economic downturn reversed itself. Times Square was transformed from grit to gaudy commercialism. As more tourists came to the city, the company, New York Apple Tours, prospered, growing from two used buses to an operation with $10 million in annual income.</p>
        <p>But as tourists flocked to the used British buses, so did city, state and federal regulators. The company amassed hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines for falsifying records and sidestepping inspectors, and drew the ire of neighborhood groups and politicians.</p>
        <p>No matter how intense the scrutiny, though, the company survived, even thrived, until last Monday, when a bus operated by a driver who the police said did not have a proper license turned onto a crosswalk at West 45th Street and fatally struck Randolph Walker, 71.</p>
        <p>By week's end, Apple Tours was in the fight of its life in an administrative hearing at the City Department of Consumer Affairs, facing a city effort to immediately suspend its license. Susan Kassapian, a department lawyer, contended that the company had shed even the veneer of decency and accumulated a list of civil and criminal violations that was remarkable for its scope and scale.</p>
        <p>Company officials have strenuously objected to the hearing, calling it a naked violation of due process. ''What they're doing to us here is completely unacceptable,'' said Hayim Grant, the company's president and Harry Grant's son.</p>
        <p>But hearing the city's case, critics were left to wonder how a company of that description could have survived for so many years in the law-and-order climate established by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>''I've never seen a company flagrantly violate the law on this scale,'' said John Kaehny, executive director of Transportation Alternatives, a watchdog group. ''How much evidence do they need?''</p>
        <p>Lawyers and business associates offer a two-word answer as one possible explanation for the bus company's resilience: Hurricane Harry, the nickname given to the company's patriarch and organizing force.</p>
        <p>They say Apple Tours is a company made in Mr. Grant's image, and that Hurricane Harry is a man undeterred by adversity, even embarrassment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grant, who immigrated from Israel to the United States with his wife and three children in 1975, penetrated New Jersey's construction industry and was a quick success, so quick that after building upscale  houses in Bergen County, he began proposing projects of an enormous scale.</p>
        <p>Harry Grant said he would build the tallest building in the world, a 121-story office tower in Newark. He never did. He proposed digging a tunnel from Bergen County to the Bronx. It never happened. He said he would open the Newark Renaissance Mall. All that remains of that venture is an uncompleted shell.</p>
        <p>In 1990, a bank started foreclosure proceedings on two of Mr. Grant's properties, saying his companies had defaulted on loans in excess of $17.5 million. The federal Environmental Protection Agency was pursuing another of his companies for 119 violations of the Clean Air Act stemming from the illegal demolition of asbestos-laden buildings in Hoboken, N.J. The case eventually resulted in a $60,000 fine.</p>
        <p>That summer, under pressure from banks and regulators, Mr. Grant filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for at least four of the companies under his control. But he insisted he was not done. In bankruptcy court, he promised he would recover within three years.</p>
        <p>His resurrection came through Apple Tours.</p>
        <p>Walter F. Timpone, one of his lawyers, said the idea for the company came to Mr. Grant when he saw double-deckers on a trip to London.</p>
        <p>In August 1991, New York Apple Tours was incorporated. Mr. Grant built the company in his vision of salting the city with stops, giving riders the chance to hop off one bus and, whenever they wished, board another.</p>
        <p>''This opened it up to tourists and let people see places around their city at their leisure,'' Mr. Timpone said. ''It was, and is, fantastically successful.''</p>
        <p>Lawyers and business associates say that if Harry Grant was stung by his long run of setbacks in New Jersey, he did not show it. He was driven, they say, and resourceful. No job was beneath him. He turned wrenches in the motor yard. At times he flew to London and returned with luggage crammed with spare parts.</p>
        <p>Lee Gelber, who was with the company in 1993 and is now manager of tour services for a rival, Gray Line, recalled Mr. Grant's work ethic: ''Harry would do everything. He'd be up to his elbows in grease.''</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Grant's leadership, the business flourished, growing from a fleet of 2 double-deckers to 63 today, according to state records and the company's office. Mike Alvich, vice president of marketing and development, said that as the company grew, it provided a public service.</p>
        <p>''We've helped the city in a number of ways,'' he said. ''Tourism is a big part of the New York City economy, and we think that we've contributed to the growth of that.''</p>
        <p>But as the company grew, it attracted doubters, then enemies, who said its problems were pervasive, affecting all aspects of the business, from environmental compliance and public safety to record-keeping and customer service.</p>
        <p>Apple Tours also angered residents and community leaders, many of whom said it illegally took empty buses down residential streets, made curb-side stops in unauthorized places, idled buses under apartment houses, irritated residents with diesel smoke and routinely double-parked, clogging byways already inundated with traffic.</p>
        <p>In 1995, residents from West 22nd Street protested the company after discovering that it was using a rented parking area as a repair yard without proper permits. Under pressure from the city, the company moved its repair operations to Long Island City, Queens.</p>
        <p>Tom Kirkland, who lives on West 22nd, said neighbors concluded that Mr. Grant and Apple Tours deliberately played outside the rules. ''He didn't do anything by the book,'' he said. ''The idea was to do it his way. Do it as long as he could. Do it until he gets chased out of the neighborhood.''</p>
        <p>In August 1995, the Department of Consumer Affairs accused the company of switching licenses on 43 occasions, apparently in an effort to use buses that had not passed state safety inspections or might not be insured. The entire fleet was temporarily taken off the streets. A settlement agreement required that the company pay a $100,000 fine and, among other things, remove Harry Grant as an officer in the company.</p>
        <p>Friends and lawyers say that although Harry Grant may have severed his formal ties with the company, he has remained a presence.</p>
        <p>''He's very much involved,'' said Frank Lucianna, one of Mr. Grant's lawyers and friends. ''He's the guiding light.''</p>
        <p>Harry Grant, who lives in Alpine, N.J., did not return three phone calls last week. In an interview Friday, Hayim Grant declined to comment on his father's role in the company, except to say that the company had grown more responsible since 1995.</p>
        <p>''Our record is very good,'' he said. ''The company has really developed into a mature, professionally run, deep-management company. It's not a fly-by-night operator.''</p>
        <p>Whatever that role, Harry Grant's troubles, and the company's, did not stop after his removal as vice president. During the late 1990's, new problems mounted.</p>
        <p>In 1998, an inspection team audited the company's compliance with a state law that mandates driver fitness and training and found more than 200 discrepancies, according to testimony on Thursday from Thomas Fullington, an assistant director of the State Department of Motor Vehicles. Apple Tours was fined $6,500, Mr. Fullington said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fullington also said the department was investigating Apple Tours again. According to his testimony, its initial review found similar problems, including an absence of documentation for driver training and medical exams.</p>
        <p>Also in 1998, Harry Grant was indicted on charges of first-degree sexual abuse, accused of attacking a female employee at the company's bus yard in Queens. He pleaded guilty to third-degree assault and was sentenced to counseling and one year of probation, a law enforcement official said.</p>
        <p>And in December of that year, a group of employees filed a class-action lawsuit against the company, claiming it had failed to pay overtime to as many as 700 workers from 1992 to 1998. The suit is in settlement negotiations, said Adam T. Klein, a lawyer for the employees.</p>
        <p>By this time, inspectors from the State Department of Transportation began noting that the company's fleet had safety problems. In a series of inspections in 1998 and 1999, Apple Tours buses failed 42.5 percent of the time, according to state data. The state sets an inspection failure goal of less than 10 percent.</p>
        <p>The state's data also show that the company's most frequent violations were in the most serious category, including deficient brake systems, steering or suspension components and emergency exits. Subsequent inspections have found that the company's inspection failure rate is improving, to 24.5 percent, but that is still two and a half times the state's compliance goal.</p>
        <p>Hayim Grant said the failures did not affect safety or the accident last Monday. ''There's no bus that's on the road operated by us that has not passed New York State Department of Transportation standards,'' he said. ''Our safety record is excellent. This is the first serious injury that we've ever had.''</p>
        <p>But Judy Shotwell, vice president  of the Midtown North Precinct Council, a neighborhood organization that works with the Police Department, said that for a long time, she and others also thought that it would take a pedestrian fatality to force the city into the current fight. ''We all knew it,'' she said. ''It was going to take a catastrophe.''</p>
        <p>In fact, it was a federal case that set in motion the city's efforts to close the company. Last week's fatality merely accelerated the action.</p>
        <p>Last fall, Apple Tours pleaded guilty in Federal District Court in New Jersey to falsifying documents submitted to three federal agencies  to avoid meeting federal safety and environmental standards on 70 buses it imported from 1991 to 1995.</p>
        <p>By admitting to a sustained deception, city officials said, Apple Tours gave the Department of Consumer Affairs the evidence it needed to try to revoke the company's licenses. ''They were convicted of a crime of essentially dishonesty,'' Mr. Giuliani said, adding that the evidence allowed ''the extraordinary step of trying to remove their license for reasons that would usually be considered beyond the Department of Consumer Affairs.''</p>
        <p>With the death last week, the city filed an emergency motion asking Administrative Law Judge Judith Gould to suspend the company's license immediately, pending the outcome of the case. And as Judge Gould was beginning her hearings, the company faced another action.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, the board of NYC &amp; Company, the city's tourism agency, voted unanimously to terminate the membership of New York Apple Tours. Cristyne Lategano-Nicholas, the agency's president, said the board had acted with knowledge of the pattern of problems, but had based its vote primarily on letters from disgruntled tourists.</p>
        <p>''The complaints against this company exceed those against any of our other members,'' she said.</p>
        <p>With the licensing fight still undecided, Hayim Grant remained resolute as the hearing ended on Friday. The tourists were pouring into the city for Memorial Day weekend. And though Hayim Grant said the police were cracking down on its buses, the company that Hurricane Harry founded was still in the fight.</p>
        <p>''We're not looking to hurt this city,'' Hayim Grant said. ''We love this city. We show it to thousands of people.''</p>
