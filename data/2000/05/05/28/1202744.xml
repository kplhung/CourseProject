Opening when its subject is 40 and a rising authority on aesthetics, Volume II of this vast biography charts Ruskin's unraveling from passionate cataloger (rocks, plants, buildings, paintings, clouds) to tragic obsessive (irrigation, drainage, running water, little girls).</p>
        <p>KARL MARX: A Life, by Francis Wheen. (Norton, $27.95.) An engaging reinterpretation of the prophet's life that defends his ideas (not very persuasively) but emphasizes his Victorian male egocentricity and bourgeois pretensions.</p>

        <p>And Bear in Mind  (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>THE BINDING CHAIR: Or, A Visit From the Foot Emancipation Society, by Kathryn Harrison. (Random House, $24.95.) A resonant, elaborately constructed novel that renders the lives of two women, an aunt deformed physically and morally by tradition and her overtly rebellious niece.</p>
        <p>BOBOS IN PARADISE: The New Upper Class and How They Got There, by David Brooks. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $25.) Affection, ridicule and plain ambivalence propel this work of ''comic sociology'' as it examines the rise of the ''bourgeois bohemian,'' the social and economic type that now controls and consumes everything.</p>
        <p>THE BOY WITH THE THORN IN HIS SIDE: A Memoir, by Keith Fleming. (Morrow, $24.) The tale of a troubled straight teenager sent to live with his uncle, Edmund White, one of the best-known, best-liked gay men on earth, who turned out to be exactly the ideal trustworthy parent.</p>
        <p>THE FEAST OF LOVE, by Charles Baxter. (Pantheon, $24.) A luminous he-said-she-said of a novel, in which He, a handsome toadlike man, and She, Ex-Wife No. 1, unspool contrary narratives of their life together.</p>
        <p>FROM DAWN TO DECADENCE: 500 Years of western cultural life, 1500 to the present, by Jacques Barzun. (HarperCollins, $36.) Who else would have the nerve to write a book by this name, or the range and clarity to succeed? The sole unpleasant prospect is the vile 20th century.</p>
        <p>THE HUMAN STAIN, by Philip Roth. (Houghton Mifflin, $26.) The novel's doomed protagonist is a modern converso: a black man passing as a Jew so he'll be taken for white; our old friend Nathan Zuckerman tells his story.</p>
        <p>JOHN RUSKIN: The Later Years, by Tim Hilton. (Yale University, $35.) Opening when its subject is 40 and a rising authority on aesthetics, Volume II of this vast biography charts Ruskin's unraveling from passionate cataloger (rocks, plants, buildings, paintings, clouds) to tragic obsessive (irrigation, drainage, running water, little girls).</p>
        <p>KARL MARX: A Life, by Francis Wheen. (Norton, $27.95.) An engaging reinterpretation of the prophet's life that defends his ideas (not very persuasively) but emphasizes his Victorian male egocentricity and bourgeois pretensions.</p>
        <p>THE MANY ASPECTS OF MOBILE HOME LIVING, by Martin Clark. (Knopf, $24.) This first novel by a Southern judge features . . . a Southern judge, who logs overtime as cuckold, bribe taker, treasure hunter and tester of abused substances but by the end has become well worth knowing.</p>
        <p>NEWJACK: Guarding Sing Sing, by Ted Conover. (Random House, $24.95.) A journalist's account of his year as a correction officer, where his moral well-being was as much at risk as his bodily safety.</p>
