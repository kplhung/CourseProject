        <p>DONALD TRUMP is known as the brash builder of Manhattan high-rises and Atlantic City casinos, not dogleg par-4's in Westchester.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Trump is building a golf course in Briarcliff Manor that will eventually include upscale apartments and town houses.</p>
        <p>It is called -- what else? -- Trump National Golf Club, and memberships start at $125,000.</p>
        <p>Preliminary work began last week on the 7,200-yard, par-72 layout, designed by Jim Fazio, a prominent golf course architect. The course is scheduled for completion by the end of next year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trump gained approvals earlier this month for the project on the 147-acre site of the Briar Hall Golf and Country Club. It will be his first project in Westchester.</p>
        <p>But something seems odd here.</p>
        <p>In the film ''Caddyshack,'' Rodney Dangerfield, who plays a boorish developer freeloading at a snobby country club, declares: ''Country clubs and cemeteries are the biggest wastes of prime real estate.'' And one of the hallmarks of Mr. Trump's career is his record of eking out every last bit of profit potential -- from craps tables to co-ops -- from his properties.</p>
        <p>But the residential component of Mr. Trump's Briarcliff plan includes only 87 units -- two apartment buildings and 16 town houses -- far fewer than a previous developer proposed. Pressed for an explanation, Mr. Trump called Westchester County ''the toughest place to build on the planet,'' citing zoning restrictions and local resistance to development.</p>
        <p>Still, he is seeking permits to build two other golf courses in Westchester, the Seven Springs Club in Bedford and French Hill in Yorktown Heights, and another in Putnam Valley, called Indian Hills.</p>
        <p>''The community likes having space and open air and generally prefers golf courses to the prospect of building 250 houses on a site,'' Mr. Trump said, referring to other developers' failures to win approval for subdivisions on the Briarcliff property and the Bedford site.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trump said he would concentrate on building holes before homes for several reasons: to capitalize on the spending power of Wall Streeters catching the golf bug, his own love of the game and a need to indulge his creative side.</p>
        <p>''I like shaping land,'' he said. ''I get a real thrill from buying it and shaping it beautifully and artistically. It's a whole other thing from building a 90-story tower across from the U.N.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Trump said that he bought the property for $8 million in a foreclosure about five years ago and is investing around $30 million to build the course.</p>
        <p>Keith Austin, the mayor of Briarcliff Manor, said that Mr. Trump hired ''an army of consultants'' to comply with town regulations.</p>
        <p>''It was important for us to keep this property a golf course,'' Mr. Austin said. ''If we didn't, there was always the possibility of it being sold for single-family homes.''</p>
        <p>Given his urban high-rise aesthetic, Mr. Trump might be expected to produce a clubhouse wrapped in shiny gold glass, but the Donald has been forced to adopt an uncharacteristic buttoned-down restraint.</p>
        <p>For instance, the Town Planning Board required the clubhouse to be a white clapboard structure, half the size of the one Mr. Trump had in mind. Nor would the board indulge Mr. Trump's wish to hold professional golf tournaments at the course. Too much traffic, it said.</p>
        <p>But if local restrictions have reined in the builder's glitz on the outside, the club is pure Trump indoors, the kind of place where a high-rolling golfer could take a supermodel girlfriend. Members could head from the 19th hole on a large veranda overlooking the course, to a formal dining room.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trump hopes to have 350 playing members and another 100 social members. Initiation fees have increased along with demand, said Carolyn Kepcher, the general manager of the course. Prices started at less than $100,000. They are now $125,000 and may increase to $300,000 before the club opens, she said. More than 100 people have already paid to join, she said. Annual dues would be $9,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fazio, the course architect, said Trump National will be a long course with several severe par-4's, up to 450 and 460 yards long.</p>
        <p>''It will play very hard from the back tees,'' he said, ''and require long drives to reach the fairways on many holes.''</p>
        <p>The course will have a hilly front nine and a flatter back nine, with streams and ponds throughout and a deep ravine meandering through six of the holes. Being built over the old Briar Hill layout, some of the new holes would use the same imprint, he said, but the holes will not run in any similar order and will occasionally even run in the reverse direction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fazio said the course would compare with Westchester's top courses, Winged Foot, which has been the host to several United States Open championships, and the Westchester Country Club, home of the Buick Open.</p>
        <p>''I've played those courses,'' he said, ''and when you compare them hole for hole, it's going to be hard to decide which course is better.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fazio designed Mr. Trump's golf course in Palm Beach. Trump National, he said, may turn out even better because the terrain, including 7,000 trees, offers natural challenges.</p>
        <p>''It will have no gimmicks or tricks,'' he said. ''It's built to challenge the pros, but I always give the weekend player a place to bail out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fazio said his partnership with Mr. Trump results in top-level golf courses because ''he doesn't give me a budget; I get a blank check.''</p>
        <p>But Ron Whitten, the architecture editor for Golf Digest, said that it takes more than money to build a great golf course.</p>
        <p>''Fazio is a talented architect, and if he gets a big budget, he'll probably build a good course,'' Mr. Whitten said. ''Will it be the equivalent of Winged Foot? Hell no. Winged Foot has 75 years worth of U.S. Opens and P.G.A.'s on them.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Trump said he plays golf once a week and is a 5 handicap at Winged Foot, his home course.</p>
        <p>Mr. Whitten said that he sneaked into Mr. Trump's locker at Winged Foot one day and, as a joke, swiped his handicap certification sticker. It showed a handicap of 6.</p>
        <p>''If he's a legitimate 6 at Winged Foot,'' Mr. Whitten said, ''he's probably spending too much time playing golf.''</p>
