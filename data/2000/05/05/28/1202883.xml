        <p>THE River Grille and Bar in Westport, which recently changed its name from The Mooring, doesn't seem like it's in a time warp, until you start reading the menu. In looks alone, it has the simplicity of a waterside restaurant (which is what it is), its wall of windows facing a small marina on the Saugatuck River.</p>
        <p>The menu, however, gives the impression that the restaurant revolution has not yet occurred. There are so many old-timers -- shrimp cocktail, clams casino, stuffed clams, and main courses of fried seafood: shrimp, sea scallops, clam strips, fish and chips. In fact, the menu was more ambitious, less basic, when we first visited (in 1978) than it is now.</p>

        <p>THE River Grille and Bar in Westport, which recently changed its name from The Mooring, doesn't seem like it's in a time warp, until you start reading the menu. In looks alone, it has the simplicity of a waterside restaurant (which is what it is), its wall of windows facing a small marina on the Saugatuck River.</p>
        <p>The menu, however, gives the impression that the restaurant revolution has not yet occurred. There are so many old-timers -- shrimp cocktail, clams casino, stuffed clams, and main courses of fried seafood: shrimp, sea scallops, clam strips, fish and chips. In fact, the menu was more ambitious, less basic, when we first visited (in 1978) than it is now.</p>
        <p>One of our guests seemed shocked when his appetizer, called river combo, arrived: a medley of mozzarella and zucchini fingers and baby mushrooms, all heavily breaded and deep-fried, and accompanied by standard marinara sauce for dipping. ''I didn't realize everything would be fried,'' he said with some dismay.</p>
        <p>Best of our starters was clams casino, even though they consisted merely of fresh tender clams, bacon and light bread crumbs. Baked stuffed clams, on the other hand, were mostly breading, lots and lots of breading. Breading was a problem in another dish, an entree of River Grille crab cakes, in which finding the essence of crab amid all the bready filler was a diner's challenge. Fried onion rings, a side order, were thick, greasy and also excessively batter-heavy.</p>
        <p>Our most unusual appetizer was bread bowl du jour. On the night of our visit, du jour meant curried chicken, A huge round of bread, bowl-shaped, with the top cut off and used as a cover, was scooped out and filled with a bland, characterless version of curried chicken. The serving was so large, an entree afterward was almost redundant. The bread bowl concept might work better as an entree, with a more inspired filling. One concept at River Grille that should please diners is the option of ordering most entrees in a small or large portion, priced accordingly. For instance, we chose the small lobster ravioli at $10.95, instead of the $16.95 portion. The small version was more than generous, with the added touch of bits of fresh lobster meat and tomato served along with the pasta in a vodka/tomato cream sauce. Now if only the pasta itself hadn't been so tough and rubbery, this would have been a top-notch dish.</p>
        <p>As it was, our two wisest choices were grilled: River Grille lemon pepper chicken (a twin breast portion) and blackened Cajun tuna. The latter, a special, was moist and well-cooked, with a lightly applied Cajun peppery spiciness, not slathered on indiscriminately.</p>
        <p>The evening's major curiosity was jambalaya. A generous hodgepodge of steamed shrimp, scallops, mussels, clams and calamari came in a so-called ''white scampi sauce,'' a thin broth with garlic and rice. It was also available in a marinara sauce. Scampi or marinara, the dish bore not a hint of resemblance to the rich, robustly-spiced Louisiana jambalaya, raising the question, where did this recipe come from? Why not call this bounteous dish a seafood medley, potpouri or stew, instead of raising unfulfilled hopes for an authentic jambalaya?</p>
        <p>After our various disappointments, we didn't expect much from desserts, but two choices were quite satisfying, notably an apple crisp, served warm with vanilla ice cream and a mildly tart Key lime pie with graham cracker crust.</p>
        <p>Dinner for two, three courses a piece, came to $65, before tax, tip or drinks. A minuscule wine list of West Coast vintages starts at $19. Prices at the River Grille are moderate, but one wishes there was greater quality and imagination in the kitchen.</p>
        <p>Still, the water views in this season are so appealing, we recommend going for a drink on the deck or for Sunday brunch. In daylight, you can enjoy all the river action, scullers practicing, boaters docking, canoeists paddling.</p>
