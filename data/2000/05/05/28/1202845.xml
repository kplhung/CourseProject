        <p>THIS is the weekend that we light up our grills and return to our swimming holes. That is, if we dare.</p>
        <p>A few weeks ago, a letter arrived from the town's board of health advising me not to become an inadvertent mosquito breeder by leaving unmounted tires and whatnot around to collect standing water.

        <p>THIS is the weekend that we light up our grills and return to our swimming holes. That is, if we dare.</p>
        <p>A few weeks ago, a letter arrived from the town's board of health advising me not to become an inadvertent mosquito breeder by leaving unmounted tires and whatnot around to collect standing water. Of course, if people in Glen Ridge left tires in their yards collecting water, my town would probably declare an aesthetic emergency before it declared a health emergency.</p>
        <p>Still, there were several sentences in the mosquito letter that caught my eye.</p>
        <p>The warning, for example, to ''stay indoors at dawn, dusk and in the early evening.'' And the sartorial tip to ''wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants whenever you are outdoors.''</p>
        <p>So much for sitting on my porch in a sun dress, watching the children catch fireflies. Or going to see fireworks on July 4. Or taking a romantic stroll down the beach to watch the sunset.</p>
        <p>And then there's the tip, in the mosquito letter, to be on the lookout for dead crows, falcons or hawks or ''waterfowl exhibiting unusual behavior.'' (A duck walks into a bar . . . ) And those comforting how-to tips on handling infected birds: ''If the dead bird is in fresh condition and suitable for testing, we will submit it to the state laboratory. If the bird is in poor condition, please discard it, double bagged in your household garbage. Wear rubber gloves or other hand protection while handling dead animals of any type.''</p>
        <p>You mean I shouldn't put them on the grill?</p>
        <p>If the mosquitoes don't get you, there are  the ticks. Both the Lyme disease and the Rocky Mountain spotted fever varieties.</p>
        <p>If the bugs don't get you, then there's the possibility of getting food poisoning from potato salad that has sat out too long, or hamburgers that haven't sat on the grill long enough. And of course, even if you manage to avoid the dreaded E. coli, you have to worry about the cancer-causing mutations that can be caused by eating charred meat.</p>
        <p>Of course, everybody knows it's dangerous to go jogging in the middle of the day, when the air quality is poor and the heat is at its peak. And ''one can absolutely predict that people are going to be sunburned this summer,'' said Bernard Goldstein, director of the Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences Institute in Piscataway. And we all know what that can lead to.</p>
        <p>''Summertime used to be so much fun,'' Dr. Goldstein said, and sighed.</p>
        <p>A Web site maintained by the state Department of Health and Senior Services provided summer phobias I hadn't even thought of. If you look up www.state.nj.us/health, you'll find -- in addition to advice about mosquitoes, ticks, heat stroke and food-borne illness -- instructions about what to do if a bat gets trapped in your house.</p>
        <p>If you read carefully, you'll find that the experts contradict one another. To avoid air pollution from ozone, you're supposed to stay inside when it's sunny and venture outside only when the sun recedes and temperatures cool. Of course, that's when the mosquitoes will get you. ''If you followed every single guideline put out by every single agency, you would be stuck in your house,'' said Michael Zichelli, director of planning and development for Glen Ridge.</p>
        <p>I know, it's easy to poke fun at all this well-meaning advice, until you talk to someone whose life has been altered by a creature smaller than a comma.</p>
        <p>To Erika Bleiberg, who contracted Lyme disease on a camping trip a few years ago, summer will never be the same.</p>
        <p>''I love nature,'' she said. ''I love the outdoors. I love being humbled by mountains and trees. I don't love being humbled by insects.''</p>
        <p>Erika is less worried by mosquitoes, however, than by the possibility that state authorities might decide to do aerial spraying for mosquitoes. (There are no plans for spraying in New Jersey, says the state epidemiologist, Eddy Bresnitz, because so far there has been no West Nile Virus in humans. What Dr. Bresnitz worries about, by the way, are his children driving.)</p>
        <p>Then there's my personal nemesis, the ice cream truck. Who needs all that fat and sugar? Or children chasing after trucks? Or those awful germs changing hands every time a child hands over a sticky quarter?</p>
        <p>But I couldn't find a health expert who would agree with me -- on the record, anyway.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't say anything bad about ice cream,'' Dr. Goldstein said. ''Are you kidding?''</p>
