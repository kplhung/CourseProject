        <p>Al Simon, who helped create some of early television's most successful sitcoms as well as the technical wherewithal to save them on high-quality film for summer reruns and syndication, died on Tuesday in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 88.</p>
        <p>Mr. Simon joined the world of television in 1946, working on the production of live programs shot in Hollywood. He got his real start when Ralph Edwards took his radio show ''Truth or Consequences'' to television and hired Mr. Simon as a writer.</p>
        <p>The show's sponsors pressed its producers to deliver an East Coast audience at a time when coast-to-coast transmission was technically impossible. The program was live and could be rebroadcast only by  kinescopes of dubious quality.</p>
        <p>Refining a technique introduced some years earlier in the motion picture industry, Mr. Simon had Mr. Edwards record his show with three motion-picture cameras on 35-millimeter film and two-track audio. The resulting film equaled the picture quality of a live broadcast, and ''Truth or Consequences'' became the first program filmed regularly before a live audience.</p>
        <p>Desi Arnaz asked Mr. Simon to adapt the three-camera system for ''I Love Lucy,'' starring himself and  his wife, Lucille Ball. In the 1950's Mr. Simon also worked on the production of ''The George Burns and Gracie Allen Show.''</p>
        <p>As president of Filmways Productions, Mr. Simon played a central role in the presentation of popular 1960's sitcoms like ''The Beverly Hillbillies,'' ''Petticoat Junction,'' ''Green Acres'' and ''Mr. Ed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Simon, who grew up in New York, was a graduate of Columbia College. He also received a law degree from New York University, but preferring the life of a writer, he began contributing to several national magazines. After serving in the Army in World War II, he moved to Hollywood to work in television.</p>
        <p>He is survived by his wife, Caro  Jones Simon; a son, David, of Los Angeles; and a granddaughter.</p>
