        <p>No, Kritter Kamp is not a summer camp for pets. It is for children entering second or third grade who love animals. The camp, run by St. Hubert's Animal Welfare Center at its headquarters in Madison, includes the usual activities like scavenger hunts, arts and crafts and outdoor games, but all of them relate in some way to animals. And each features a visit to one of St. Hubert's animal shelters. This year, the shelter is offering a Petting Sitting Basics workshop for those aged 11 to 14. Topics include animal behavior, safety with animals, grooming, handling emergencies with animals, pet law and pointers on starting a pet-care business. The Kritter Kamp sessions, $200 a week, are offered July 24 through 28; Aug. 7 through 11 and Aug. 21 through 25. The pet-sitting workshops, $125, consist of three parts, from 9 a.m. to noon, and are offered June 27, 28 and 29 and July 11, 12 and 13. St. Hubert's accepts donations for those who would like to support children on a scholarship. Information: (973) 377-8877 or www.sthuberts.org.</p>
