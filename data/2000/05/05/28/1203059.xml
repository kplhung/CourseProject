        <p>MUSEUM MILE  When Neighborhoods Were Defined by the El</p>
        <p>Relatively few elevated trains are left in the city, but neighborhood life along the tracks is being celebrated in ''Under the El'' at the Museum of the City of New York.</p>
        <p>Prints and drawings from artists like Philip Reisman, John Sloan and Glenn O. Coleman chart the changing attitudes toward elevated transport and range in style from narrative scenes to Social Realist portraits. Mr. Coleman's ''Election Night'' (above) from 1928, shows life in the cramped, narrow streets underneath the tracks juxtaposed with a celebratory bonfire.</p>
