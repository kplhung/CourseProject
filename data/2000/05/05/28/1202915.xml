        <p>THE irony of Rob Givone's professional tennis career is that when he finally thought he knew how to win at the highest level, he hurt his shoulder. Then when a professional tournament was staged in his backyard, he had already retired.</p>
        <p>Givone, a 27-year-old from Katonah, played his last professional match in Beaumont, Tex., in October.

        <p>THE irony of Rob Givone's professional tennis career is that when he finally thought he knew how to win at the highest level, he hurt his shoulder. Then when a professional tournament was staged in his backyard, he had already retired.</p>
        <p>Givone, a 27-year-old from Katonah, played his last professional match in Beaumont, Tex., in October. A shoulder injury, which required surgery and kept him off the tour for more than 18 months, never fully healed. He stood on the sidelines and watched last week as a new Challenger Tournament, with players ranked from 90 to 300 in the world, took place at the Canyon Club here.</p>
        <p>Tennis is perhaps the hardest professional sport to crack. A player can still lose money because of traveling and coaching costs. Givone said that in about three and a half years on the tour, he won maybe $40,000 in prize money: a drop in the bucket compared with the investment made by his father, Bob, and a few corporate sponsors, which enabled Givone to take his shot a the big time.</p>
        <p>''I thought I was going to be No. 1 in the world,'' Givone said wistfully. ''I'd lose 7 to 5 in the third set to Mark Philipoussis, and it wasn't until much later that I stepped back and asked myself, 'What did he do at 4-all in the third set to win?' '' Philipoussis is ranked 15th in the world now.</p>
        <p>''I was going for broke in the big points, but he had already won the match by wearing me down throughout the match,'' Givone continued. ''I didn't realize that every point has a purpose. It's amazing how the top guys are relentless.''</p>
        <p>At 22, in his first full season on the pro tennis circuit, Givone came into the 1995 U.S. Open Qualifying Tournament with a ranking of 348. He had left Georgia Tech in Atlanta after his junior season and toured the clay  court tournaments in Europe and South America, developing his ground strokes.</p>
        <p>At 6-foot-3, 195 pounds, with a cannon serve and quick feet for a man his size, Givone already had an adept serve-and-volley game. Givone faced Karsten Braasch of Germany in the  second round of the Open Qualifiers.</p>
        <p>Braasch, a crafty lefty, had once been a top-50 player. With a win over Braasch, Givone would be one match away from entering the U.S. Open main draw. His first big payday and a sizable number of ranking points, good as gold for a young professional player, also sweetened the pot. But something went wrong on that August day.</p>
        <p>''It was a really windy day,'' Givone recalled. ''On a serve where I tossed the ball out too far, I hurt my shoulder. I felt uncomfortable and it was kind of hurting afterward, but I kept trying to stretch it out.''</p>
        <p>With endorsement contracts and a breakthrough in the rankings on the horizon, Givone felt that taking a few months off to let the injury heal was out of the question.</p>
        <p>''I thought I could play through the injury,'' he said. ''I was young. What did I know?''</p>
        <p>More than two years later, suffering off and on from a dead arm, Givone was playing in the doubles semifinals of a tournament in Czechoslovakia when he hit a serve and felt his shoulder dislodge. He finished the match and after icing his shoulder all night, he showed up for his singles semifinal match the next day. But he had to withdraw early in the first set.</p>
        <p>Shoulder surgery for a torn labrium and six months of rehabilitation followed, but Givone had to give up his dream of breaking the world's top-100 only seven months into his comeback.</p>
        <p>''My shoulder couldn't take the grind,'' he said. ''I knew I couldn't serve as big as I used to.''</p>
        <p>Givone believes he was a victim of timing.</p>
        <p>''Turning pro at 21 was too late,'' said Givone, who along with Phil Williamson of Mount Vernon attained the highest professional ranking of any Westchester players. ''You're in your prime at 21 and 22, but it takes three years of experience on the pro tour to make it.''</p>
        <p>Surprisingly, he also points to his fiery temperament as a hindrance.</p>
        <p>''I worked too hard at the beginning,'' Givone said. ''I wasn't laidback enough. I was terribly competitive in a lot of ways that were bad. I wanted to win every single point with a big shot. But tennis is a game of who makes the least unforced errors. You have to put yourself in the best position to make a high percentage shot.''</p>
        <p>Coaching the game now, Givone said he looks for ''legs, balance and mental toughness'' in his young students. ''You always can develop great strokes.''</p>
        <p>Finishing his business degree at Columbia starting next fall and possibly a career on Wall Street awaits Givone. The experience of playing professional tennis, he believes, will steel him for any of life's problems.</p>
        <p>''This is the absolute best game to help you out in life,'' he said. ''It's one on one. You learn how to pick yourself up. You become so tough mentally and emotionally. Now when I meet adversity, I say, 'Oh, come on, man.' I'm ready to attack because in tennis, you can never back out.''</p>
