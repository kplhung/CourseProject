        <p>As a psychotherapist in practice for more than 30 years, I was very pleased to see so much space devoted to the subject of emotions in your magazine. The most radical change I have seen in therapy is a shift from the medical-illness model for common emotional problems to a more ''fitness based'' model. Most patients are simply in bad emotional shape.</p>

        <p>As a psychotherapist in practice for more than 30 years, I was very pleased to see so much space devoted to the subject of emotions in your magazine. The most radical change I have seen in therapy is a shift from the medical-illness model for common emotional problems to a more ''fitness based'' model. Most patients are simply in bad emotional shape.</p>
        <p>In addition to exploring the source of problems and providing a safe, supportive environment, therapists are using role-playing and visualization exercises as well as instructing clients to practice self-supportive thoughts, all of which they can also do as homework (emotional workouts). I see the future of psychotherapy as the development of these emotional-fitness regimens.</p>
