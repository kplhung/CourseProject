        <p>IT has been a long, bumpy road toward professional status and artistic credibility for the Schoolhouse here. The game of  art and chance in regional theater means win some, lose some, within the context of a body of work and the vision of a director in charge. It does not refer just to putting on one play after another.</p>
        <p>With Pamela Moller Kareman ensconced as artistic director and a standard Actors Equity contract, which means more than an intermittent guest shot in a concession to a small theater, the Schoolhouse can win or lose like a pro.</p>
        <p>And with Ms. Kareman's flowing and caring staging of Beth Henley's quirky, wondrous play ''Abundance,'' the Schoolhouse is winning, major league style. Even in its floundering days, the little theater cum gallery went for broke, staking its claim to mostly non-mainstream fare, at times distressingly undoing an otherwise worthy play by overreaching with wrong-headed casting, or stilted direction.</p>
        <p>Since virtually everything goes right with ''Abundance,'' it should be proclaimed the Schoolhouse's true coming-of-age production. The good things that came before were practice. Given the severe professional theater drought in Westchester, mostly because of the county's failure to support one faithfully, win or lose, it is important to welcome this lovely production and give a long-range chance to Ms. Kareman, who has been working her way into the job since September 1998.</p>
        <p>Ms. Henley's play appeared to be just passing through, for one month in 1990, at the Manhattan Theater Club, an Off Broadway nonprofit theater. In an annual series citing the theater season's best plays and chronicling all the others, ''Abundance'' was judged ''over long and underwritten'' -- by an editor who has over lengthened and underwritten his share of plays.</p>
        <p>At the intimate Schoolhouse, the play has found a rightful home. To one who saw but was not conquered by the original staging, ''Abundance'' is indeed a different play, and a new one for being newly realized.</p>
        <p>Ms. Henley, best known for ''Crimes of the Heart'' and ''The Miss Firecracker Contest,'' has perhaps struck out more often than she has scored. Her recent Off Broadway play, ''Family Week,'' was one of the current season's instant casualties. But when she's good, as here, she is distinctive of voice.</p>
        <p>Because ''Abundance'' is about friendship, between two women and among two couples, the same women and their husbands by arrangement, it is also about betrayal, in all combinations. Because the setting is Wyoming and St. Louis, in the late 1860's, it is facile to stick a pre-feminist label on Ms. Henley's concerns, especially since the self-worth of Bess Johnson and Macon Hill depends on pleasing the deranged, abusive Jack Flan and the dopey William Curtis.</p>
        <p>Bess and Macon are special-delivery brides, according to what presumably were the dictates of personals ads, frontier style. To Macon the uncontainable free spirit, submissiveness to a man is just a ruse; submissiveness to ''the lure of the unknown'' is what she is after, and  she has mighty big ideas, especially about her destiny. She vows to write a novel -- and put Bess in it. But Bess, who feels helpless, mindless and useless, wants only to be Jack's ''one true one,'' a phrase that pierces the heart when it is reiterated -- 25 years later, and not by Bess.</p>
        <p>The reversals, every which way, in Ms. Henley's play, have immense dramatic impact. An unpoetic voice and lesser stylist would have made them patly predictable. The four actors shine, as does an excellent supporting fifth (Tyne Firmin as Bess's  collaborator when she writes a book!). Through a very tall tale involving a wildfire, changes in fortune and the captivity and scarring of Bess by a savage Indian tribe, Ms. Henley's unfailingly theatrical sense of adventure remains ever fresh. Quinn Cassavale does a complete, soul-satisfying and ultimately rending turnabout as Bess.</p>
        <p>When Sarah Baker, as Macon,  promises eternal friendship in an enchanting first scene, you will believe it. When she says she would  ''rip the wings off an angel if they'd help me fly,'' you are ready to watch her take off. The duplicities that follow are thoroughly, humanly motivated. In the end, she is unutterably moving. How to subtly swagger has to be seen in Dep Kirkland's many shaded performance as Jack. Keith Barber is annoying, lovable, desperately assertive and altogether goofy as William. ''Abundance' travels -- and lands right in the heart.</p>
        <p>''Abundance'' by Beth Henley at the Schoolhouse Theater, 1 Owens Road in Croton Falls. Performances through June 11. Box office: 277-8477.</p>
