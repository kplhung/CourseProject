        <p>LIKE death, taxes and those sprayed helmets of hair sported by many women on the Upper East Side, some things never seem to change. Like summer movies. Always the same: fiery explosions, knockout special effects, thin plots, well-muscled stars. Add to that nonstop television commercials, toys on the shelves, action figures in the Happy Meal. It seems so formulaic.</p>
        <p>Despite appearances, however, the summer blockbuster has changed plenty since its birth -- widely acknowledged as June 1975, when ''Jaws,'' the first movie to be treated to a full television ad campaign, began systematically terrorizing the nation. But the changes have been subtle and cumulative.</p>
        <p>Cooking up such a film may still look as simple as following a recipe, but with the escalation of technology, the proliferation of movie screens and a steadily increasing number of films, the path to official blockbusterdom has become as complicated as a quadratic equation, and as hard to calculate. ''There's just an ether in the world when a movie breaks through,'' said the director Barry Sonnenfeld, whose ''Men in Black'' (a successful 1997 blockbuster) was followed last summer by ''Wild Wild West'' (a bust). ''You can't predict it, you can't market for it. You just have to breathe it in.''</p>
        <p>If that is true, then this summer's contenders could use an oxygen tent. The sound you have been hearing in the pre- and early summer season air is conspicuous silence. Remember, as early as April 1999, ''Star Wars: Episode I -- The Phantom Menace'' and its product line were being flogged so relentlessly that the Force was with us even in our dreams.</p>
        <p>Not to mention that by then teenagers across America, primed by the publicity machine for ''Austin Powers: The Spy who Shagged Me,'' were already greeting pals in the mall with a rousing ''Shagadelic!'' (Blockbuster Rule No. 1: the average number of times that teenagers see a summer blockbuster is 2.8. Repeat customers are the secret to racking up $100 million in ticket sales.)</p>
        <p>Many would have been hard-pressed to name the five most anticipated films for the summer of 2000. (Among the top contenders are the ''Mission: Impossible'' sequel, ''M:i-2'' (which opened on Wednesday); ''X-Men''; ''The Patriot,'' with Mel Gibson; ''Gone in 60 Seconds,'' with Nicolas Cage and Angelina Jolie; and Wolfgang Petersen's adaptation of Sebastian Junger's ''Perfect Storm.'')</p>
        <p>The contrast between the last two seasons illustrates how complex the making and marketing of summer movies has become. Some Hollywood insiders say preseason buzz has been light this time around because the films simply aren't very good. Studios, they say, are no longer willing to promote a mediocre movie heavily in the hope that marketing alone will push it to blockbuster status. ''Godzilla,'' said one producer, referring to the 1998 film that was heavily promoted and disappointingly received, ''changed everything.''</p>
        <p>Others counter that the relentless hyping of ''Phantom Menace'' simply tired the public out. Besides, they argue, there is no reason to spend lavishly on publicity when overall ticket sales rose more than 65 percent during the 1990's, to $7.4 billion last year. If you release it, the conventional wisdom goes these days (cadged, of course, from an April release, ''Field of Dreams''), they will come.</p>
        <p>Another reason for the lack of prerelease hoopla is that many in this summer's crop of films don't lend themselves to licensing, which has in the last decade become a crucial source of profit and promotion (sorry, kids, no Tom Cruise ''M:i-2'' action figure). ''The most important thing about licensing isn't really the money you make,'' said Danny Simon, president of the Licensing Group, which puts together deals between manufacturers and movie studios. ''It's the promotional value of having those products on the shelves, the excitement it generates for the film in the hearts of every kid who passes by.''</p>
        <p>So far this season hasn't even seen the usual overhyped product-placement deals, an important element of summer films since the 1982 hit ''E.T.'' (The decision back then by the M &amp;M  Mars Company not to pay the filmmakers for using M &amp; M's as a crucial plot point in Steven Spielberg's film led to the makers of Reese's Pieces' gaining an avalanche of publicity.)</p>
        <p>Fresh in many executives' minds is the memory of last summer's surprise: the extraordinary success of two modestly financed films, ''The Sixth Sense'' and the ''Blair Witch Project.'' A few executives said they were advising their studios to hang back, hoping to ride the trend toward such smaller movies that turn into blockbusters by word of mouth.</p>
        <p>''A few years ago, people were totally focused on getting big budgets and promotional commitments,'' said one producer with several large-scale blockbusters under his belt. He called it the ''Independence Day'' mentality. ''Now you think to yourself, is there any way I can make a small film that hits huge, which works out so well for everyone. You think that, even though you know it's ridiculous. You can't plan for something like that.''</p>
        <p>The good news for moviegoers is that as filmmakers and studios seem to be casting about for the next wave, the movies themselves seem to be getting smarter, or at least less cartoonish.</p>
        <p>Not all of them, of course, but a significant number. Gone, for now, are pure testosterone-driven vehicles of the sort that Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sylvester Stallone specialized in during the 1980's and early 1990's. In their place is a more balanced palette of offerings, including last year's ''Notting Hill'' and this June's ''Me, Myself and Irene,'' a comedy with Jim Carrey and Renee Zellweger. There is also a golf story directed by Robert Redford, ''The Legend of Bagger Vance,'' which stars Will Smith and Matt Damon and is due out in August.</p>
        <p>Although this year will have plenty of slam-bang adventure and science-fiction films, including Paul Verhoeven's ''Hollow Man'' (opening Aug. 4), with Kevin Bacon as an invisible man, and this month's ''Battlefield Earth,'' adapted from an early novel by L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, the trend seems to be toward real-life, character-driven suspense. For example, the history-based ''Gladiator,'' with Russell Crowe, which earned more than $102 million in its first three weeks, and ''The Patriot,'' a Revolutionary War drama opening June 28. Instead of aliens, the most fearsome enemy seems to be the elements, as battled by George Clooney in ''The Perfect Storm.'' Even ''X-Men,'' adapted from a popular comic book, is said to emphasize the humanness of its superheroes.</p>
        <p>This summer's movies feature polished but decidedly unpumped stars like Mr. Cruise, Patrick Stewart, Chris O'Donnell and Mr. Cage. ''As compared with some of the action stars of the past, these guys take a very active role in making sure their characters aren't just stereotypes and that the movies aren't overmarketed,'' said Brian Grazer, who produced the 1995 hit ''Apollo 13,'' among others. During the making of that film, said Mr. Grazer, Tom Hanks insisted that the marketing plan avoid imitating the classic over-the-top campaigns of the 1990's: ''How he handled it really made an impression on me.''</p>
        <p>This season it was Mr. Cruise himself who rejected the idea of big licensing tie-ins to ''M:i-2,'' said Mr. Simon of the Licensing Group.</p>
        <p>BUT star control is only one way in which the economic infrastructure of the summer blockbuster has changed. Even the very definition of a blockbuster has metamorphosed since ''Jaws,'' which set the benchmark at $100 million. That stayed pretty stable until the 1990's, when the grosses started climbing. Since 1997, the cut-off seems to be $200 million. And that's just in domestic ticket sales. Add to that overseas sales, licensing, video, soundtracks and product placement, most of which didn't even exist when ''Jaws'' hit the beach.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for the studios, production budgets have swelled even faster. ''E.T.'' made $399 million and cost $10 million. (The film is part of summer movie lore; even though ticket prices at the time were about $4, it remains the fourth-highest-grossing picture of all time.)</p>
        <p>For studios, the stakes are enormous. Pressured toward profitablity by the entertainment conglomerates that now own them, they have become increasingly dependent on summer revenue. Last year, 40 percent of the studios' $6.9 billion annual take came in the weeks between Memorial Day and Labor Day. Jerry Bruckheimer, producer of ''Armageddon,'' said: ''Some people like to dismiss summer movies as just entertainment, but the truth is that they are hugely important to the health of studios. In summer every night is Saturday night and there is a lot of pressure to perform, more than ever before.'' Mr. Bruckheimer is also the producer of ''Gone in 60 Seconds'' and ''Coyote Ugly,'' both coming this summer, as well as the highest-budget film ever approved -- the $135 million ''Pearl Harbor,'' due next summer.</p>
        <p>Although directors like Mr. Sonnenfeld insist it's impossible to plan for a blockbuster, some producers say there is now no choice but to try. Kathleen Kennedy, who produced ''E.T.'' for Mr. Spielberg, said that back then no one had enough foresight to fully exploit the merchandising possibilities of the cuddly alien. This year, she said, long before she started filming the third ''Jurassic Park,'' she found herself in studio meetings focusing solely on cross-promotion and licensing.</p>
        <p>Of course, not even the definition of summer has stayed the same. Forget the calendar; as far as Hollywood is concerned, summer started weeks ago with the opening of DreamWorks' ''Gladiator,'' Sony's ''I Dreamed of Africa'' and Universal's ''Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas''</p>
        <p>Underlying these changes are two developments: the proliferation of films being released and the multiplexing of America. Both are good news for theater owners, but treacherous for moviemakers and moviegoers.</p>
        <p>With more than 40 pictures to open in just three months this year, summer scheduling has become a Hollywood obsession. The trick is to find a weekend when there is no formidable competition. To that end, studios now announce release dates long before the first frame has been shot (though to add confusion, those dates are often shifted).</p>
        <p>''Opening big'' has always been crucial to summer movies, but now, with the average multiplex offering 6 screens (some have as many as 25), the fate of each film is decided 45 minutes into the first showing on Friday night. While there has been some reversal of the trend toward snap judgments in fall and spring films -- inspired by slow-growing hits like ''American Beauty'' and ''Shakespeare in Love'' -- the pressure has escalated in summer.</p>
        <p>These days, if the audience isn't laughing or gasping enough by 7:45 p.m. on that first night, theater owners can easily decide to boot the film and replace it with additional showings of the action-adventure flick next door. ''You're out literally by the 9:30 p.m. show,'' Mr. Bruckheimer said. ''It can be brutal.'' For moviegoers, it can mean being faced with the same four rock-'em-sock-'em movies playing in a 12-screen cineplex.</p>
        <p>With competition fierce for those summer teenage dollars, filmmakers increasingly employ high-tech effects. There may be fewer jacked-up physiques on screen, but there are more gadgets and cinematographic sleight-of-hand. What allowed ''Jaws'' to chomp its way into the public consciousness was the realism of the mechanical great white. That lesson has grown into a mantra in the intervening decades.</p>
        <p>From the doe-eyed extraterrestrial in ''E.T.,'' which now looks so primitive, to the dinosaurs of the 1992 ''Jurassic Park'' and the pyrotechnics of last year's dizzying ''Phantom Menace,'' computer technology has become a cornerstone of summer films. Animated films, which were once limited to a single Disney picture every few years, are now made by several studios using innovative techniques. (This year, ''Dinosaur,'' which opened on May 19, ''Chicken Run'' (June 23) and ''Titan A.E.'' (June 16) are among the entrants.)</p>
        <p>The Internet has also had a profound effect on the making of a blockbuster. Its democratizing nature has led to unexpected hits like the ''Blair Witch Project,'' which was marketed almost entirely online through the filmmakers' own efforts. But the Internet has also made it very hard for filmmakers to stop the leaking of information -- especially negative market research and focus-group feedback -- before the film is ready to be released. Such bad word of mouth, instantly communicated to millions of teenagers, is a sure killer for summer films.</p>
        <p>''When you're doing a big movie, you try a lot of things -- the last thing you want is your process to be reviewed before you're done,'' said Gale Ann Hurd, a producer of ''Terminator,''  ''Aliens'' and ''Armageddon.''  ''It's frightening.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sonnenfeld believes that one of the reasons ''Wild, Wild West'' did so badly on its opening weekend was that ''misinformation'' got out on the Web and was picked up by journalists. ''It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Sonnenfeld, a master of combining computer effects with quirky stories, looks forward to another technological leap that will be a great boon to him and other filmmakers. The way he sees it, digital transmission, in doing away with the costly process of striking thousands of prints, will change everything. Within a couple of years, he suggested, a filmmaker whose blockbuster is starting to fade a bit at the box office could easily zap in some additional footage to lure teenagers back for another viewing. ''That,'' he said, ''would stand summer on its head.''</p>
