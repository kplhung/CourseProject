        <p>THE television screen snaps into focus on a Tel Aviv army recruitment office in 2015, where a strapping Israeli raised in the United States has come home for his military service. ''I'm here to defend my country,'' he says, resonating with classic Zionist conviction.</p>
        <p>The officer he faces has flowers in his shoulder-length hair and a glazed look in his eyes. ''Why do you want a gun?'' he asks. ''Guns are dangerous.''</p>
        <p>''To defend my country against the Syrians.''</p>
        <p>''What's wrong with the Syrians?'' asks a second officer wearing bellbottoms and a peace medallion. ''My wife is Syrian.''</p>
        <p>The sketch, on the Israeli equivalent of ''Saturday Night Live,'' mocks a future Israel at peace. And while the notion may amuse the hip north Tel Avivians who wrote and performed the sketch, it is no joking matter to others in Israel. They fear that peace will mean an obliteration of the Jewish state through a slow refusal to engage the enemy, a lowered guard and intermarriage.</p>
        <p>Last week's images of Israeli soldiers retreating from Lebanon as Muslim guerrillas declared victory, and the prospect of yielding more West Bank land to the Palestinians amid threats of unrest, have made that fear the focus of growing anxiety.</p>
        <p>Indeed, some Israelis say the future is already here, that their nation, steeped now in consumerism and cable television, is nearly drained of the shared, antimaterialist conviction on which it has survived. While most hope that by yielding land and ending occupation they are sowing further peace and prosperity, some also fear that therein lie the seeds of self-destruction -- that the young will lose their commitment to defense.</p>
        <p>It is that anxiety that underlies the ferocity of another national debate, over new histories of Zionism and changes in the school curriculum. These revise the standard Zionist self-image -- the righteous, selfless pioneer -- in favor of a more complicated and less heroic one. They portray early Zionists both as humans drawn into war's inhumanity, and as European colonialists.</p>
        <p>This fight is in the background as Israel stakes out a new strategy for confronting Syria and Lebanon; it illustrates a deep internal conflict over whether Israels today see themselves as having a special mission or, after centuries of discrimination, should only seek ''normality.'' And it raises the question of how Israel measures up morally and politically against its neighbors. The new scholarship assumes that Israel shares the blame for the conflict with its adversaries and should come to terms with them as moral and cultural equals.</p>
        <p>The contested revisionism, known as ''new history,'' presents evidence of deliberate mistreatment and expulsion of Palestinians as well as efforts to block diplomatic arrangements with the surrounding states while publicly proclaiming a thirst for peace. To the new historians, Israel's occupation of southern Lebanon and its use of a proxy militia there were a continuation of a disastrous policy that dismissed Arabs as either peasants or mercenaries.</p>
        <p>Efforts to co-opt the locals and punish those who failed to play along were part of a pattern that emerged before the state was established in 1948, it is argued. Evidence of early misdeeds began piling up from newly-opened state archives in the 1980's. When published, the revelations were controversial. But it was the addition of such notions to ninth grade textbooks this past year that created a storm. Some Israelis say that teaching the young about early Zionist sins is the start of mass suicide.</p>
        <p>Hillel Halkin, a writer and translator, lamented in a recent issue of Commentary magazine that the textbook changes are ''a process of numbing and emotional divorce'' that, in effect, invites students to decide whether Jews or Arabs have a stronger claim on the land'' and saps Israel's ability to defend itself.</p>
        <p>''The Jews of Israel are an exhausted people, confused and without direction,'' writes Yoram Hazony, a young, conservative Israeli analyst whose new book is called ''The Jewish State: The Struggle for Israel's Soul.'' (Basic Books). In the book Mr. Hazony assails not only the new history but the growing intellectual and political movement in Israel that is broadly known as ''post-Zionism.''</p>
        <p>In essence, post-Zionism asserts that the task opf saving the world's Jews by bringing them to their homeland and making it secure is now complete. At the same time, about a sixth of Israel's citizens are not Jewish either because they are Arabs or not-fully-Jewish refugees from the former Soviet Union. The post-Zionist conclusion is that Israel should reduce or end its Jewish character, changing its identity from ''the Jewish state'' to a state of all its citizens.</p>
        <p>This alarms Mr. Hazony, who says that the devotion to land and Jewish nationalism that characterized his parents' generation is hard to find today.</p>
        <p>The struggle between old-style Zionists and the post-Zionists is, ultimately, a battle over individualism in a society that spurned it for so long. Anyone who visited Israel in the late 1960's will recall the smug superiority of a nation nearly without drugs, crime or disaffected young people, where the young were outfitted in scouting uniforms and hiking the wilderness, vying for top jobs in the air force.</p>
        <p>Today Israel has dozens of cable channels and a choice of consumer goods to rival any Western country. It has the largest number of Nasdaq-traded companies outside the United States and Canada.</p>
        <p>Some young Israelis are beginning to see their nation as just one among many and the new history only confirms that.</p>
        <p>For liberals, the shift in history teaching is welcome news and a necessary preface to peace because it fosters the growth of individualism, which they see as a vital check on group coerciveness. In other words, they say, by freeing Israel of a single self-congratulatory narrative, the new historians and post-Zionists have offered freedom from what Yaron Ezrahi, an Israeli political scientist, calls ''the tyranny of supposedly shared meaning.'' When one's heros are reexamined and understood to suffer from weakness and even inhumanity, one's adversaries become less menacing. They, too, are only human. With that understood, they say, negotiation is easier.</p>
        <p>As the curriculum shift and the Lebanon retreat make evident, Israel's liberals are winning the struggle over how to cast the national narrative. It remains to be seen whether they can get the promised peace.</p>
