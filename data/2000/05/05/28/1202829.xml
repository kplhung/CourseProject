        <p>LOUISIANA is fast becoming the nation's capital of filthy-rich rappers. Hip-hop stars on local labels like Cash Money cruise New Orleans in gold Hummers, sport jewelry worth tens of thousands of dollars and spend nights partying in luxury hotel suites. But while his contemporaries are sleeping off the night before, DJ Jubilee, the regional star who first popularized many of hip-hop's current catchphrases, is rising at 5:30 every morning to take the school bus.</p>
        <p>By day, Jubilee teaches special-education classes at West Jefferson High School on the west bank of New Orleans. But by night, he rules the dance clubs and block parties, acknowledged as the master of the call-and-response booty-shaking dance music called bounce. The New Orleans rapper Juvenile took the title and chorus of his top-10 single, known in its radio-friendly version as ''Back That Thang Up,'' from a local hit of a similar name by Jubilee. And, most recently, Master P (who runs No Limit Records in New Orleans) released a hit with his group the 504 Boyz, ''Wobble Wobble,'' the title of which was also lifted from a DJ Jubilee lyric. In both cases, Jubilee received neither credit nor royalties.</p>
        <p>But he claims not to mind. On a recent Monday morning, DJ Jubilee sat behind a teacher's desk in the school's special-ed room, wearing a white T-shirt and a large pendant promoting his label, Take Fo' Records. ''I like my job,'' he smiled. ''I wrote my last three hits at this desk.''</p>
        <p>After school, Jubilee (born Jerome Temple), 34, takes on a third identity: as coach. He works with the girl's basketball and boy's football teams at his alma mater, Walter L. Cohen High School; he also trains several pre-teen teams for the New Orleans Recreation Department. All this coaching is strictly volunteer.</p>
        <p>After teaching from 6:45 a.m. to 2 p.m., coaching high school teams until 6 p.m. and working with the recreation department until 7:30 p.m., he spends the rest of the night in the studio or appearing in concert or D.J.-ing block parties, arriving home after 1 a.m. for four hours of sleep, if he's lucky.</p>
        <p>''I make some nice money,'' he said. ''Between teaching and D.J.-ing and record sales, I make between $23,000 and $24,000 a year.''</p>
        <p>Though other regions have their own homegrown booty music -- Miami bass and Detroit ghetto tech -- New Orleans bounce is a synthesis of more disparate parts. It incorporates elements of hip-hop, second-line parades, fraternity step shows and the innuendo-soaked rhythm-and-blues of Southern singers like Rufus Thomas. It also evokes square-dance calling and the sock-hop dance crazes of the 50's. In concert, DJ Jubilee incites the crowd through a litany of dances, most of which he has either invented himself or spread after seeing them at one of his parties. ''Do the dirty bird,'' ''shake it like a sissy,''  ''wobble it'' and ''walk it like a dog,'' he calls as his four male dancers demonstrate the dances on stage, turning their backs to the audience or even standing on their heads as they practically dislocate their backsides and shake them up and down like a low-riding car. From middle-aged women to small children, almost everyone at a bounce party knows each suggestive dance by heart.</p>
        <p>''You might have a girl who's 17 years old with a daughter who's 3, and she'll be teaching her how to shake it like a dog,'' Earl Mackie, who runs Take Fo' Records, said with a laugh. ''That's just New Orleans. If you go back to the origins of bounce, I always compare it to the old Indian chants and the beat of the Indian drums.''</p>
        <p>Take Fo' Records, with DJ Jubilee as its crown jewel, has long been one of New Orleans's most respected independent hip-hop and bounce labels. For seven years, Mr. Mackie has run the low-key company out of the office of his father's roofing business. Last year should have been payback time for DJ Jubilee, Mr. Mackie and Take Fo'. With bounce beats and slang all over the radio in the form of Juvenile's ''Back That Thang Up,'' Missy (Misdemeanor) Elliot's ''Hot Boyz'' and the Cash Money supergroup known as the Hot Boys, it seemed like this New Orleans bounce factory was primed for the national success it had long yearned for. Even Tommy Boy Records was chasing after DJ Jubilee with a record contract. But, instead, disaster struck.</p>
        <p>''Everything went wrong in 1999,'' Mr. Mackie said with a sigh. ''We signed a deal with Tommy Boy Records, and they held us up in that contract for a year and never let us put an album out. Our distributor went bankrupt and never paid the $100,000 they owed us. Bobby Marchan, our promoter and booking agent, died. We lost everything. I had to put a mortgage on my house to release the Bounce Squad album.'' (A spokeswoman for Tommy Boy said that Jubilee was released from his contract last summer with ''no strings attached.'')</p>
        <p>''For a long time, a lot of people questioned bounce and said it wasn't legitimate,'' Mr. Mackie continued. ''Now No Limit and Cash Money are doing our songs. I feel like Take Fo' is the feeder label. The problem is that when major labels listen to our stuff now, they think we're a copycat label.''</p>
        <p>So, instead of becoming a household name, Jubilee remains a regional star and schoolteacher. On his desk calendar, he has a George Eliot quote he often turns to for inspiration: ''Keep true; never be ashamed of doing right.'' For much of his time teaching special education, DJ Jubilee has worked with just one student, Chad Albers, who often sits at a desk next to him wearing protective headgear. Several of the other students can name Jubilee's songs and mimic some dances, but not Mr. Albers.</p>
        <p>''I've been with him since '97,'' Jubilee said. ''But he only just learned my name last year.''</p>
        <p>He turned to Mr. Albers. ''What's my name?''</p>
        <p>''Jubilee,'' Mr. Albers said slowly, grinning.</p>
        <p>''How old are you?''</p>
        <p>''17.'' Mr. Albers smiled.</p>
        <p>''He's 21, but he has the number 17 stuck in his head,'' Jubilee said. ''He has a problem with seizures. There's another student here who's partially blind, and another one who's really smart but is schizophrenic and is always laughing at the voices in his head. We try to teach them the basic survival skills they need -- their name, address, the date and time, and what holidays are coming up. We want to teach them the concept of being streetwise.''</p>
        <p>The story of DJ Jubilee's success is the story of Take Fo' Records. The label began after a public-access television show Mr. Mackie was working on, ''Positive Black Talk,'' lost its grant. When Mr. Mackie helped organize a dance to raise funds, he ended up raising more money in one night than in two years with the show. He soon began throwing parties full time, grooming his cousin and niece to perform as an opening act at their productions. With an employee of the cable company named Henry Holden as producer, Take Fo' was founded to release their first record, under the name Da'Sha'Ra. Mr. Mackie then found Jubilee D.J.-ing at a dance. ''He was telling everybody what to do, and it was like 'Soul Train,' '' Mr. Mackie said, ''because the whole crowd was following everything he said. He was a football coach, and didn't take the music thing seriously. We kept calling him for weeks until we got him to sign with us.''</p>
        <p>JUBILEE, who had actually been D.J.-ing since the early 80's, created a new dance for his first single, ''Do the Jubilee All,'' which became a local sensation in 1993, selling 30,000 copies. When his popularity soared again with the success of ''Back That Up'' in 1998, Jubilee discovered that almost every new phrase and dance he used was ripped off by someone else on a record or at a party.</p>
        <p>''I'm fighting to keep my mouth closed,'' he said. ''They used to ask me in interviews where I got my ideas from. I'd say second line parades or high school dances, and then the next day, all these rappers would be out there looking for new ideas.''</p>
        <p>He continued: ''Somebody just got another one. The 504 Boyz got 'Wobble Wobble.' I saw Master P on TV and they asked him, 'What's the meaning of ''Wobble Wobble''?' And I could have kicked the TV: He said it means when you're hanging out with your boys, you're wobbling.''</p>
        <p>He paused and shook his head. ''You go say 'wobble, wobble' to a girl, and you watch what happens!''</p>
        <p>But Jubilee said he had no animosity toward Juvenile or Master P: they simply inspire him to be more creative. ''People say just hang in there and it will come,'' he said as the clock reached 2 o'clock and a yellow school bus pulled up outside the classroom, waiting to whisk him away to the jobs he continues to work in obscurity, despite a nation of rap fans singing his lyrics.</p>
