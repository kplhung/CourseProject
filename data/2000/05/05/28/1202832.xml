      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Vienna has long been called the City of Music, but Nigel Simeone, a lecturer in the department of music at the University of Wales in Bangor, makes a case for sharing the distinction with Paris. His book ''Paris -- A Musical Gazetteer,'' scheduled to be published by Yale University Press on Tuesday, suggests hundreds of sites associated with composers and performers who have lived in Paris in the last 400 years, including such non-Frenchmen as Chopin, Donizetti, Liszt, Mozart, Prokofiev, Rossini, Stravinsky, Verdi and Wagner.</p>
        <p>Landmarks include houses, monuments, graves, churches and concert halls, with directions. The armchair traveler may appreciate such arcane details as the fact that the Palais Garnier, which houses the Opera, has 2,531 doors and 7,593 keys.</p>

        <p>Vienna has long been called the City of Music, but Nigel Simeone, a lecturer in the department of music at the University of Wales in Bangor, makes a case for sharing the distinction with Paris. His book ''Paris -- A Musical Gazetteer,'' scheduled to be published by Yale University Press on Tuesday, suggests hundreds of sites associated with composers and performers who have lived in Paris in the last 400 years, including such non-Frenchmen as Chopin, Donizetti, Liszt, Mozart, Prokofiev, Rossini, Stravinsky, Verdi and Wagner.</p>
        <p>Landmarks include houses, monuments, graves, churches and concert halls, with directions. The armchair traveler may appreciate such arcane details as the fact that the Palais Garnier, which houses the Opera, has 2,531 doors and 7,593 keys.</p>
        <p>The bulk of the book is devoted to brief biographies, enumerating the places where composers and musicians lived or stayed.</p>
        <p>The author outlines four separate walks, including a circular walk from Les Invalides; the neighborhood of Passy; from the Opera to Montmartre Cemetery; and from Place de l'Alma to the Etoile.</p>
        <p>Sites noted in the book include 12, place Vendome, Chopin's last home; 4, avenue Carnot, Ravel's apartment; La Trinite, the church where Messiaen was organist for 61 years; the Opera and the Opera-Comique, the Theatre des Champs-Elysees, the Musee de la Musique and various cemeteries, especially Pere-Lachaise and Montmartre.</p>
        <p>The book costs $40 in hardcover, $18.95 in paperback. It can be ordered by calling (800) 987-7323 or by visiting the Yale University Press Web site, www.yale.edu/yup.</p>
