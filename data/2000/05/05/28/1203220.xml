        <p>Police ballistics tests confirmed yesterday that a handgun found in the possession of one of two suspects now in custody was used to kill five Wendy's restaurant workers and wound two others who had been bound, gagged and shot execution-style in a gruesome robbery-massacre in Queens last week.</p>
        <p>Investigators said the ballistics tests further strengthened a seemingly overwhelming case against the suspects, John B. Taylor, 36, and Craig Godineaux, 30, who were arrested on Friday less than 48 hours after the shootings at the Wendy's on Main Street in Flushing.</p>

        <p>Police ballistics tests confirmed yesterday that a handgun found in the possession of one of two suspects now in custody was used to kill five Wendy's restaurant workers and wound two others who had been bound, gagged and shot execution-style in a gruesome robbery-massacre in Queens last week.</p>
        <p>Investigators said the ballistics tests further strengthened a seemingly overwhelming case against the suspects, John B. Taylor, 36, and Craig Godineaux, 30, who were arrested on Friday less than 48 hours after the shootings at the Wendy's on Main Street in Flushing.</p>
        <p>The gun, a Bryco .380-caliber semiautomatic that the police said had been purchased in Ohio, was found in a belt pack on Mr. Taylor when he was arrested at his sister-in-law's home in Brentwood, N.Y. A senior law enforcement official said it appeared that one gun had been used to shoot all the victims in a walk-in basement refrigerator.</p>
        <p>Investigators now believe that Mr. Taylor fired the bullet that killed the manager, Jean Dumel Auguste, and that Mr. Godineaux fatally shot the other four, according to one senior law enforcement official. Those conclusions were based on a new statement that Mr. Godineaux made to investigators yesterday, they said. On Friday, in videotaped statements to investigators, both men accused each other of being the gunman.</p>
        <p>In police lineups yesterday, two witnesses -- one of the two survivors and a woman at a bus stop -- identified both suspects, law enforcement officials said. They said that a third witness, the driver of the Q58 bus on which the police believe the killers fled, had identified one of the suspects.</p>
        <p>A senior law enforcement official said that another important item of evidence would be a videotape taken from a surveillance camera in the Wendy's dining area. It was found at the house where Mr. Taylor was taken into custody, and both suspects appear on it, the official said.</p>
        <p>''The surveillance video is chilling,'' said another law enforcement official, ''because you see all the victims, and at some point along the line, when the victims are downstairs, you see Craig Godineaux putting these black gloves on and ripping the phone out of the wall and going downstairs.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor had worked at the Wendy's in Flushing last fall, but had been dismissed by Mr. Auguste for stealing receipts. Prosecutors say Mr. Taylor, who has worked at, and robbed, a series of fast-food restaurants in recent years, and Mr. Godineaux, who has served three prison terms for robbery and drug offenses in the 90's, were to be arraigned in Criminal Court in Kew Gardens, Queens, today on charges of armed robbery and first- and second-degree murder.</p>
        <p>If the suspects are indicted, tried and convicted of first-degree murder, they would potentially face the death penalty or life in prison, prosecutors said. The Queens district attorney, Richard A. Brown, has 120 days to decide whether to seek the death penalty. The decision would be based on factors like the nature of the crime, the defendants' criminal records, their state of mind at the time and the wishes of the victims' families.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown would not discuss details of the statements made by the suspects, but said, ''We're trying to get to the bottom of exactly what transpired in that basement'' at the restaurant.</p>
        <p>The suspects, in their videotaped statements to investigators, implicated themselves as well as each other as they described planning the robbery and detailed how the robbery and massacre were carried out, a law enforcement official said. Mr. Taylor, in his statement, told investigators that Mr. Godineaux had been adamant about shooting the victims. ''No witnesses! No witnesses!'' he quoted Mr. Godineaux as saying.</p>
        <p>The official said the statements described how Mr. Godineaux bound most of the victims with duct tape, how plastic bags were placed over their heads, and how, when it was all over, the two men took a Q58 bus to an apartment at Lefrak City, where they split $2,400 in stolen cash.</p>
        <p>''Both are saying, 'I got nothing, or I only got a little,' '' the senior law enforcement official said. ''Both are attempting to minimize their part in the crime. We're not dealing with terribly intelligent people here. Both implicated themselves. They are in very deep.''</p>
        <p>An unspecified amount of cash was also found in the Brentwood house, investigators said. Another important item, they said, was Mr. Taylor's palm print, found on a box in the Wendy's basement.</p>
        <p>The other survivor, Jaquione Johnson, 18, who had a bullet wound in the head, remained in critical condition yesterday at the New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens.</p>
        <p>Funerals, meantime, were being planned by the families of the dead -- Anita C. Smith, 22, of South Jamaica; Ramon Nazario, 44, of Flushing; Jeremy Mele, 18, of Neptune, N.J.; Ali Ibadat, 40, of Ridgewood, Queens; and Mr. Auguste, 27, the night manager, who lived in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Law enforcement officials attributed the swift arrests and the strength of the case to a combination of circumstances -- a tip, a bit of luck, and legwork by more than 100 investigators coordinated by the case detective, James Ngai, his supervisor Lt. John Shatinsky, and Lt. William Nevins of the Queens homicide squad.</p>
        <p>Investigators yesterday said that the suspects had apparently known each other for only a few months, that Mr. Taylor had planned the crime and that he had recruited Mr. Godineaux as an accomplice.</p>
        <p>The investigators said the two entered the restaurant before the 11 p.m. closing and sat in the dining area for a time. Mr. Taylor then asked for Mr. Auguste, and was directed to the basement office. Mr. Godineaux waited in the dining room.</p>
        <p>Shortly after closing time, Mr. Auguste, using an intercom, called the six members of his staff to the basement. They went down, followed by Mr. Godineaux, and were confronted by Mr. Taylor and the gun. Mr. Godineaux then bound most of the victims, who were herded into the refrigerator, made to lie on the floor and methodically shot.</p>
        <p>Mr. Castro told investigators he played dead after being shot through the cheeks. They quoted him as saying he heard the assailants talking, and more shots. He then passed out and awoke an hour later to find the assailants gone and almost all co-workers dead.</p>
        <p>He freed himself and called 911. He then dragged Mr. Johnson upstairs.</p>
        <p>Investigators said that a tip first led them to suspect Mr. Taylor, and by tracking his use of a cell phone they found him in Brentwood, in Suffolk County. Acquaintances said Mr. Taylor was the father of three and had lived at Lefrak City in Elmhurst, with his children, until last fall, when he was evicted.</p>
        <p>In recent years, he had worked at various McDonald's and Wendy's outlets in Manhattan and Queens, at times as an assistant manager and at others as a counter or kitchen employee. In 1996, he was convicted of burglarizing a McDonald's on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan, where he had previously worked. He was sentenced to five years' probation.</p>
        <p>The authorities said he robbed or tried to rob five fast-food restaurants in Queens in an eight-day period last June. He was caught running away from a $427 robbery on June 23, and was freed later on $3,500 bail. He jumped bail in the fall.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Taylor, who had previously worked at a Wendy's in Elmhurst, got a job at the Wendy's in Flushing last August, and worked there until October, when he was fired for stealing receipts.</p>
        <p>Denny Lynch, a Wendy's spokesman, said that his criminal record might have been overlooked or might not have come up in the company's customary background checks.</p>
        <p>The Timeline  String of Jobs in Fast-Food Restaurants, and a Trail of Trouble</p>
        <p>John B. Taylor, 36, a suspect with Craig Godineaux, 30, in the killings at a Wendy's in Queens last week, has had a string of fast-food jobs -- and repeated brushes with the law, the police and his acquaintances said.</p>
