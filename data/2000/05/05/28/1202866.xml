        <p>DR. DAVID SHOBIN could not have produced his latest medical thriller, ''The Provider'' (St. Martin s Paperbacks, $6.99), at a more opportune time. Everybody, it seems, has a bone to pick with health maintenance organizations, and it's payback time, says the physician-author, who has published six novels.</p>
        <p>''H.M.O.'s are everyone's favorite villain these days,'' said Dr. Shobin, whose practice is in Smithtown. The book's premise, like most of his hospital-based novels, is about a good thing run amok. In this case, it's about the ghoulish steps an unscrupulous insurance company takes in trying to rein in hospital costs. ''It takes place in the University Hospital at Stony Brook only because it's the facility I am most familiar with,'' Dr. Shobin said. ''The horrific nature of what goes on in the novel had nothing to do with the stellar quality of the hospital, I can assure you.</p>
        <p>''Being an assistant professor on staff, I am in there weekly doing grand rounds, attending continuing education and performing surgery. So far, between all the radio interviews and television interviews, I haven't heard any negative feedback.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Shobin, a gynecologist who gave up obstetrics after his 5,000th delivery, commiserates with patients whose experiences with H.M.O.'s are often negative. ''Unfortunately, managed care focuses on the disease rather than the prevention of illness,'' he said. ''The most obvious cases of this involves obesity and smoking.'' Medical costs related to lung cancer and obesity amount to billions of dollars, he said, adding, ''Ethical physicians are disgusted with the whole system because it forces us to spend time on administrative duties while distracting us from doing what we were trained for: to help people stay healthy.''</p>
        <p>''The Provider'' shines a harsh light on the Newborn Intensive Care Unit at the University Hospital at Stonybrook ''These units, found in most of the teaching hospitals, typically cost insurance companies hundreds of thousands of dollars because of the level of care that preemies require,'' he said. ''The story, which involves blood-letting, bone collecting and other nasty business, is not about revenge or vindictive. I just wanted to write an entertaining page-turner for the beach.''</p>
