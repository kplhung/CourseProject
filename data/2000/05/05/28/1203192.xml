        <p>The specter of Adam Petty will be evident Sunday when Dale Earnhardt Jr. tries to expand on a distinguished rookie season and Robby Gordon goes for an usual racing double in the Nascar Winston Cup series' longest race of the year.</p>
        <p>A flag honoring Petty -- the 19-year-old driver killed in a wreck on May 12 -- will fly over Victory Lane at Lowe's Motor Speedway, site of the Coca-Cola 600.</p>
        <p>Kyle Petty, Adam's father and head of Petty Enterprises, will not be there. He is taking off until next weekend's race in Dover, Del., to mourn his son's death.</p>
        <p>Earnhardt Jr., the only driver to win more than one Winston Cup race this season, fully understands the potential peril that comes with every race.</p>
        <p>''What happened to Adam puts everything in perspective,'' the 25-year-old Earnhardt said. ''You never know when you're going to be here or not.''</p>
        <p>Earnhardt has certainly been driving as if there were no tomorrow. He has two victories and last week became the first rookie to win the series' all-star race, The Winston, and has been taking a lot of the spotlight away from his legendary father, Dale Sr.</p>
        <p>After Earnhardt Jr. won in Richmond, Va., his father gave him congratulatory hugs, but then the seven-time series champion whispered to his son that he was leaving and to find his own ride home.</p>
        <p>''I know he's happy and proud when his son and his car win,'' Earnhardt Jr. said. ''But at the same time, if his son and his car win, he doesn't, and that's got to be a little tricky.''</p>
        <p>Earnhardt Jr. collected $516,410 for his victory in The Winston, not bad for a guy who was working in the service department of his father's auto dealership several years ago. He bought a 25-foot boat and pickup truck with recent winnings.</p>
        <p>Yet the real gravy may lie ahead. Earnhardt Jr. is blossoming into a crowd favorite. He received the warmest applause of the night on Wednesday when he qualified for the Coca-Cola 600 pole with a lap of 186.034 miles an hour, breaking the track qualifying record established in 1994. ''It's exciting,'' he said of the crowd's reaction. ''I just hope I don't get tired of it.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Gordon wants to attempt a racing double accomplished by just two men: driving in the Indianapolis 500 and the Coca-Cola 600 on the same day. John Andretti (1994) and Tony Stewart (1999) are the only to do so. The Indy 500 starts at noon today, the Coca-Cola 600 at 6:05 p.m.</p>
        <p>Gordon plans to leave Indy by helicopter from the track infield, head to the airport for the flight to Charlotte, then take a helicopter to Lowe's. A nurse will be on the plane to make sure he is not dehydrated.</p>
        <p>If Gordon cannot make it to Concord, Bryan Reffner will be standing by to drive the No. 13 car.</p>
        <p>Stewart, who went without food for much of the day in performing his double, said Gordon should make it barring rain or a victory in the Indy race. A victory would likely require him to stay for a celebration and news conference.</p>
        <p>''I think he'll probably fare better physically than I did last year,'' Stewart said. ''I think nutrition-wise he'll know what to do to keep his energy up during the day.''</p>
        <p>PIT STOPS</p>
        <p>Lowe's officials seemed uncertain whether to reopen the pedestrian walkway that collapsed a week ago Saturday, injuring 107 people, three critically. H. A. WHEELER, the track president, fretted about the psychological effect any reopening Sunday would have when more than 180,000 people jam the track. The walkway, 17 feet high, spilled fans onto Highway 29. Investigators did find that the five-year-old walkway contained grout that was contaminated by calcium chloride, thus weakening it.</p>
