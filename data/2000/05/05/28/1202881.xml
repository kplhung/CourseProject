        <p>THE change in squash equipment has helped ignite interest in the game for younger players, said Craig Brand of the United States Squash Racquets Association of Bala Cynwyd, Pa.</p>
        <p>There are now smaller versions of their parent's rackets available and a beginner's ball that stays in the air longer, making it possible for a child to more easily reach it.</p>
        <p>But it was a fundamental change in the way Americans play the game of squash that has spurred the growth among junior players, Mr. Brand said. In the mid 1980's the United States switched over from the hard ball to the soft ball that is used in international competitions.</p>
        <p>''The soft-ball game at the entry-level is more forgiving than the hard-ball,'' Mr. Brand said..</p>
        <p>According to Kai Neitche, the product manager of the Dunlop Maxfli Sports Corporation of Greenville, S.C., the company developed the Max Progress and Max ball and a mini squash ball made of foam for young and beginning players to try to increase participation. Their mini racket has had brisk sales. Overall squash racket sales for Dunlop increased 20 percent in 1999.</p>
        <p>Wilson now makes junior rackets and Black Knight has a popular junior racket as well. Junior rackets can cost from $25 to $150.</p>
        <p>Squash was said to have evolved from Fleet Prison in London in the early 19th century and soon it was played in English schools. The game was brought to the United States by the headmaster of St. Paul's School in Concord, N.H. in 1882. But because the unheated courts were often below freezing, a harder rubber ball was developed. In the mid 1980's, hardball play gave way to the international soft ball.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brand said there are now outreach programs designed to increase interest in the sport.</p>
        <p>''The most notable is Squashbusters, started by Greg Zaff in the Roxbury section of Boston,'' Mr. Brand said. ''It combines squash and academics. It's remarkable and highly successful.'' There is also a program in New York called Citisquash.</p>
        <p>''It's changing'' said Paul Assiante, the men's coach at Trinity College. ''For years and years it came from the upper demographic. You're seeing more squash spread out publicly in this country.''</p>
