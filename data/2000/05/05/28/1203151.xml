        <p>There was a sense of disbelief in both dressing rooms at First Union Center late Friday night.</p>
        <p>For the stunned Philadelphia Flyers, it stemmed from their inability to close out an Eastern Conference semifinal series that they had once led, three games to one. For the elated Devils, it was because they had somehow come back to win the series in seven games.</p>
        <p>''I'm not going to say that we completely believed we could,'' said defenseman Ken Daneyko, the only player to appear in all 125 of the Devils' postseason contests.</p>
        <p>Jason Arnott, who assisted on both of Patrick Elias's goals in the series-deciding 2-1 victory, was more succinct when asked if he honestly thought the Devils could come back after losing Games 3 and 4 at home. ''No,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Devils did it the hard way. Three of their four victories, including two of the last three, came on road ice. No team had ever erased a 3-1 series deficit this late in the playoffs, but the Devils did so with a nail-biting Game 7 victory on Elias's second goal of the night, only 2 minutes 32 seconds away from sudden death.</p>
        <p>That Elias provided all of the Devils' offense was fitting. He led New Jersey in goals, points and game-winning goals during the regular season. That came after he sat out the first month in a contract dispute with the team president, Lou Lamoriello.</p>
        <p>''It's kind of a weird feeling,'' Elias said. ''But it's a great feeling.''</p>
        <p>In the other dressing room, the mood was predictably subdued. ''It stinks,'' said Brian Boucher, the rookie goaltender who had powered the Flyers in the playoffs. ''Up three games, we had three cracks at it.''</p>
        <p>But all three times, Philadelphia came up short. And the Devils will begin the Stanley Cup finals at home on Tuesday against the winner of the Dallas-Colorado series. The Devils won the cup in 1995.</p>
        <p>In a series that was tied through 6 games, 2 periods, 17 minutes and 28 seconds, the most enduring image was the Flyers' Eric Lindros slumped on the ice 7:50 into Game 7, with what turned out to be another concussion.</p>
        <p>Lindros's head crashed violently against the ice in his second game since returning from postconcussion syndrome.</p>
        <p>''It was sickening to see something like that,'' said Lindros's teammate John LeClair, one of two skaters who helped carry Lindros off the ice. Lindros walked out of the building Friday night under his own power, accompanied by his father, Carl. Today, the Flyers confirmed their hulking 27-year-old center had sustained a concussion, his third this season and fifth in the past two years.</p>
        <p>Scott Stevens, who was responsible for the clean but vicious open-ice shoulder hit at the Devils' blue line that knocked Lindros out, felt about the same.</p>
        <p>''I was definitely thinking about his career,'' said Stevens, who at 36 has imposed his physical stamp on each of the Devils' three playoff series this spring. ''I don't want to be anybody who ends someone's career. I went into the dressing room all by myself and I was upset. It takes a bit away from this win.''</p>
        <p>While his teammates headed home to ponder what could have been, Lindros spent the evening at Pennsylvania Hospital under observation. ''You don't want to lose Eric Lindros,'' Flyers Coach Craig Ramsay said. ''And we don't want to see this young man get hurt again.''</p>
        <p>Even if Lindros does return to play next season, Friday's game was probably his last for the Flyers, given his family's bitter relationship with General Manager Bob Clarke. But that did not stop the Flyers from bringing Lindros back for the end of the series with the Devils. He returned for Wednesday's Game 6, after one practice; he had been medically cleared to play.</p>
        <p>On Thursday night, Ramsay approached his mentor, Roger Neilson, about joining him on the bench for Friday's game. Ramsay replaced Neilson as Philadelphia's head coach this season, while Neilson has battled cancer. The succession process was strained. And like the continuing Lindros saga, it was a seasonlong distraction to the team. In the end, Ramsay and Neilson decided against having Neilson return Friday.</p>
        <p>During the second intermission, Devils Coach Larry Robinson, upset with his team's performance during the period, replayed the tirade he had delivered to the team after Game 4.</p>
        <p>''He came in and gave us an earful again,'' Randy McKay said. ''Maybe not quite as much, but he was pretty loud.''</p>
        <p>Whatever Robinson said, it worked. ''After Larry gave us that little rant, it seemed to light a spark under us,'' Daneyko said.</p>
        <p>That made Lamoriello look like a hockey genius. He replaced Robbie Ftorek with Robinson with eight games left in the regular season, while the Devils were in the midst of losing the points title -- and the ensuing home-ice advantage in the playoffs. ''In my mind, I didn't think we were going anywhere,'' Lamoriello said.</p>
        <p>And now, for only the second time in the franchise's history in New Jersey, the Devils are going to play for the Stanley Cup.</p>
