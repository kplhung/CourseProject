        <p>Instead of caps and gowns, the graduates wore basketball and soccer jerseys. Instead of ''Pomp and Circumstance,'' the crowd swayed to ''Stand by Me.'' And instead of conferring 1,000 degrees, Brown University presented only one today, to Casey Shearer, a beloved member of the senior class who died less than a week before he was to graduate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shearer, 21, suffered a sudden shutdown of his heart, brought on by an undetected viral infection, after a basketball game with friends on May 19, his family said. He never regained consciousness and died four days later.</p>
        <p>His classmates, determined that Mr. Shearer should still graduate with plenty of fanfare, organized this commencement four days before their own, which is Monday.</p>
        <p>There were as many laughs as tears at the gathering, as friends and family praised Mr. Shearer's quick smile, poked fun at his penchant for giving everyone a nickname (his was ''Case,'' or ''Case Dog''), and maligned his mediocre jump shot.</p>
        <p>Despite his magna cum laude degree in economics, Mr. Shearer was remembered foremost as a sports lover who covered games for Brown Student Radio and wrote a sports column for The College Hill Independent, a weekly college newspaper.</p>
        <p>His father, Derek N. Shearer, a longtime friend and economic adviser to President Clinton, said he was amazed by the 80 friends who kept vigil at the hospital while his son was in a coma. He said the service typified all the things his son loved about Brown.</p>
        <p>''He chose Brown because it was his sense that this was the most friendly and diverse mix of kids,'' said Mr. Shearer, a fellow at the Woodrow Wilson International Scholars Center in Washington.</p>
        <p>Casey Shearer's network of friends stretched from Providence to southern California, where he grew up, to Finland, where he attended high school while his father was ambassador. Through his father, he made friends in the White House, as evidenced by Mr. Clinton's attendance at the service.</p>
        <p>His arm around the first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton, the president recounted how Mr. Shearer had tried to tutor him in rap music before an appearance on ''The Arsenio Hall Show'' in 1992.</p>
        <p>But politics was not in his game plan. Nearing graduation, he had already mailed out tapes of his broadcasts of Brown games, in hopes of landing a broadcasting job.</p>
        <p>Politics did not seem to matter much to his friends, either, who remembered him more for his ability to memorize the statistics of every Brown athlete and his inability to eat his usual morning bowl of Cheerios without dribbling milk down his chin.</p>
        <p>''Those of you who belong with Casey to the Class of 2000 will know that he marches by your side on Monday,'' said Sheila E. Blumstein, the interim president of Brown. ''You will hear his laugh and see his smile.''</p>
