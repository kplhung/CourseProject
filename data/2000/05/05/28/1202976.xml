        <p>The Mamaroneck Village Board last week unanimously approved a contract for a private company to build and operate a new clubhouse and multi-sport center at Harbor Island Park but delayed awarding the contract. Some residents urged the board to postpone action on the plan until a task force begins studying the park in June. Others praised the board, saying the tennis courts at the park have been poorly maintained for years. The contract would require replacing the park's eight clay tennis courts with a faster-drying surface. The board will vote on June 5 whether to give the contract to Harbor View Racquet Club, the current manager of the courts, or Sportime, a Long Island-based company.</p>
