        <p>Bennington College, a tiny, quirky, hilltop jewel box of liberal artsiness, is hardly a stranger to controversy.</p>
        <p>Founded in 1932 as a women's college challenging educational orthodoxy, the upstart developed a history of innovation, a tradition of teacher-practitioners -- often cutting-edge figures in art, drama, dance and literature -- working in close relationship with their student-apprentices and, in recent decades, academic politics of exceeding viciousness.</p>
        <p>But with the college having fallen on hard times by 1994, its niche nibbled away by changes in the Ivy League and other institutions, its student body reduced in quantity and quality, some of its faculty lapsing toward mediocrity and its finances in peril, the trustees, the administration and the faculty came up with a restructuring plan called the Symposium after a two-year agonizing reappraisal.</p>
        <p>A third of the faculty -- 26 of 79 professors -- was fired in a single stroke in 1994.</p>
        <p>''What people knew about Bennington was that it's the most expensive college,'' said Dr. Elizabeth Coleman, the tough-minded president who came to Bennington after serving as dean of the undergraduate division at the New School University in New York City. But, she said, that was ''the only thing'' they knew.</p>
        <p>When she arrived here, in 1987, she was shocked to discover that College Board scores at the once highly selective school had fallen to an average 1100 out of a possible 1600.</p>
        <p>Six years later, the college administration says, Bennington is on the road to recovery, with money raised, admissions rising and three dormitories planned. But the college is once again in turmoil with dissident and dismissed faculty members casting Dr. Coleman as a dictatorial figure who crushes any criticism. Two trustees have resigned.</p>
        <p>Edward Hoagland, the distinguished nature essayist who is perhaps the best-known faculty member, has publicly called for Dr. Coleman's resignation, as has the writer Jamaica Kincaid, who has taught at the college and is married to a member of the music faculty, Allan Shawn.</p>
        <p>The infighting has been bitter. In an exchange of letters in the local newspaper, The Bennington Banner, Mary Oliver, who holds a Pulitzer Prize in poetry and an endowed chair at Bennington and supports Dr. Coleman, told Ms. Kincaid, in so many words, to stick to her gardening.</p>
        <p>The past academic year has been marked by the dismissal of four faculty members -- one in the middle of the semester -- seen by their supporters as critics of the administration and by Dr. Coleman as having fallen short in their professional qualifications and responsibilities. The novelist Roland Merullo, who had counted himself a close friend of Dr. Coleman's, resigned his teaching job in protest. There have been emotional meetings on campus, and a protest demonstration was mounted by the American Association of University Professors demanding tenure protection.</p>
        <p>What is striking is that nearly all of the critics, in their next few breaths, give Dr. Coleman credit for having saved the college six years ago.</p>
        <p>''She did good for the college -- in fact, she may have saved it -- in her first half-dozen years,'' Mr. Hoagland said in an interview. ''But her temperament is a warrior temperament -- it's not right for the healing process that's needed now. She is vindictive; she has proven that a number of times.''</p>
        <p>In a letter to the trustees dated March 28, pecked out on one of the old manual typewriters on which he has written 17 books and more than 100 essays, Mr. Hoagland wrote, ''I have never seen a faculty as intimidated and unhappy as Bennington's is now, nor autocratic power exercised so quirkily and punitively by a college president, at such a cost to academic freedom.''</p>
        <p>Asked about Mr. Hoagland's characterization of her personality, Dr. Coleman replied: ''I think it's silly. It's ridiculous.''</p>
        <p>The 1994 Symposium changes, which had attracted national attention -- not all of it favorable -- included abolishing traditional departments like literature, which had become political power centers, and setting up a new employment system. Bennington had what was called ''presumptive tenure,'' with five-year contracts that, in practice, were almost always renewed. Now there would be shorter contracts and a faculty review process. Dr. Coleman said she intended to restore a standard of high achievement in the teachers' outside professional work.</p>
        <p>''We are trying to create a continuum between the work they were doing in the world and their teaching at Bennington,'' Dr. Coleman said in a two-hour interview defending her policies. ''The board said, 'Let's make the most exciting, compelling design possible. Let's go for the gold.' In a funny way they could do this because they had nothing to lose.''</p>
        <p>In the fall semester, Dr. Coleman declined to renew the contracts of two teachers, Steven Cramer, a poet, and Tony Eprile, a South African novelist, even though they had been recommended by the faculty review committee.</p>
        <p>In February, the trustees' chairman, John W. Barr, an investment banker and poet, wrote a memorandum to the faculty suggesting that the review committee be scrapped because its ''tendency toward uniform enthusiasm'' for rehiring teachers made its recommendations ''unilluminating and frequently interchangeable.'' All five committee members resigned in protest.</p>
        <p>Then, as spring semester began, Dr. Coleman told Derek E. Campbell, a popular, 59-year-old drama professor who had taught here for nine years and had been highly recommended by the review committee, that his contract would not be renewed. She said he had not acted enough in theaters outside the area.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Campbell contends he was let go for criticizing Dr. Coleman. ''My dismissal has been a clear and unambiguous example of abuse of power,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But, like others, he said he had been initially supportive of Dr. Coleman's innovations: ''I thought the college was headed for disaster. Her determination, her vision, her energy, saved us from imminent closure. She kept this institution alive. Liz sees herself as an educational visionary. But she cannot tolerate dissension or dialogue.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Campbell's dismissal was ''the last straw,'' Mr. Merullo wrote in a letter of resignation to Dr. Coleman on March 4. ''In working so hard to rescue Bennington and make it flourish, in putting in place your vision for a different kind of higher education, you have, of late, repeatedly crossed the line of basic human decency and are creating a culture laced with quiet fear.''</p>
        <p>As controversy mounted, a philosophy professor, Carlin Romano, was quoted in The Chronicle of Higher Education as calling Dr. Coleman ''a serial violator of academic freedom'' and predicting that he would be fired.</p>
        <p>He was, almost immediately. But Dr. Coleman and other officials say it was because he was chronically late with the evaluations students get instead of grades and that he had made threats to a dean.</p>
        <p>The college spokesman, David Rees, insisted that the process at Bennington was actually a triumphant one. ''Separate incidents have been bundled together,'' he said, ''to create the impression that something dark and ominous is going on here.''</p>
        <p>Editors' Note:  June 9, 2000, Friday  An article on May 28 about turmoil at Bennington College over the dismissal of some faculty members in a reorganization referred to events surrounding the firing of a philosophy professor, Carlin Romano. It said that before Mr. Romano's dismissal he was quoted in The Chronicle of Higher Education as calling the college president, Dr. Elizabeth Coleman, ''a serial violator of academic freedom'' and predicting that he would be fired. The Times article also said Dr. Coleman and others attributed Mr. Romano's departure to his chronic lateness with evaluations and his having threatened a dean.</p>
        <p>In fairness the article should have included a response from Mr. Romano. He denies having made threats. His prediction about dismissal came from an April 28 article in The Chronicle, which truncated a quotation from the journal's March 31 issue, in which Mr. Romano said he expected ''to be fired or in some way discriminated against or punished like everyone who has spoken out before.''</p>
