        <p>THE top echelon of contemporary singer-songwriters will converge at the Appel Farm Arts and Music Center next Saturday for a festival that will feature the best the genre has to offer.</p>
        <p>The one-day open-air Arts and Music Festival will be presented on two stages, with 50 crafts booths and a children's village. This is the 12th year for the festival, which has presented such performers as Emmylou Harris, John Prine and Randy Newman.</p>
        <p>Sean Timmons, Appel Farm's 43-year-old artistic director, said he prefers booking contemporary acoustic songwriters. ''They are people creating their own work,'' Mr. Timmons said, ''and that fits in with the theme of the arts center.''</p>
        <p>It is also a musical style that fits well with the outdoor setting, which Mr. Timmons said is ''more folkie and family-oriented.''</p>
        <p>Many of the featured artists appeal to a diverse crowd. Mary Chapin Carpenter, perhaps the festival's biggest marquee name, straddles both folk and country. Mr. Timmons called the award-winning country music star ''the cream of the crop.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Carpenter's thoughtful, literate music took Nashville by storm in the mid-1990's, changing the country music landscape from songs about trucks and drunken binges to thinkpieces about relationships and topical subjects like AIDS. She displayed a sharp journalistic eye, along with a keen wit. She is sometimes brainy, sometimes downright silly, as demonstrated by her hit singles ''I Feel Lucky'' and ''Shut Up and Kiss Me.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Carpenter, who is writing material for a new album, said: ''This will be our first visit to the festival. It's a privilege to be a part of such a great lineup of artists and a lovely way to kick off our summer wanderings.''</p>
        <p>While Ms. Carpenter enjoys the most commercial success of all the performers, Richard Thompson might be considered by many to be the jewel in the festival's crown.</p>
        <p>A former member of Fairport Convention, Mr. Thompson is widely regarded as one of the most technically proficient and inventive guitarists on the scene. Add that to his unique melancholy vocals, and his well-conceived folk-rock songs and there is an exhilarating combination.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson, one of the leaders of the late-1960's British folk-rock movement, has inspired many artists, including a few on the festival's bill like Lucy Kaplansky. Once part of a duo with Shawn Colvin, Ms. Kaplansky, who now writes her own material, included Mr. Thompson's defiant ''When I Get to the Border'' on her debut album ''The Tide.''</p>
        <p>One of the most expressive voices in contemporary folk, she formed Cry Cry Cry, the critically acclaimed trio, with Dar Williams and Richard Shindell. Ms. Kaplansky, who has a doctorate in psychology, possesses a plaintive voice, and her succinct phrasing and eloquent original material leave her unrivaled.</p>
        <p>Formerly part of the Boston-based folk duo The Story, Jonathan Brooke returns to the festival where she has treated the crowd to jazzy folk. In his attempt to attract a younger, more alternative folk crowd, Mr. Timmons said acts like Ms. Brooke, Moxy Fruvos and Martin Sexton are very appealing.</p>
        <p>Moxy Fruvos is an upbeat, offbeat quartet that connects with the audience through irreverence and far-flung musical styles. Mr. Sexton has a more serious appeal. The Atlantic recording artist, a highly respected songwriter, utilizes his voice in many ways, from delicate warbling to yodeling.</p>
        <p>Other performers include John Gorka (a vivid storyteller, whose observant, sometimes funny slices of life deal with everything from love to politics), Willy Porter (a guitarist stylistically similar to Leo Kottke and Michael Hedges who has toured with The Cranberries and Tori Amos) and Greg Brown, whose booming bass voice, folk-country musical style and cinematic, sardonic lyrics set him apart.</p>
        <p>There's a big buzz surrounding another performer, the Welsh singer David Gray. Last month, he released his American recording debut, ''White Ladder,'' on Dave Matthews's new ATO record label.</p>
        <p>The Asylum Street Spankers is a 10-piece band from Austin, Tex., that does not plug in. They do not even use microphones. The combo fuses acoustic blues, folk, gospel and a lot of other traditional forms in a humorous, topical and riveting set.</p>
        <p>Two local acts will be performing: Vanida Gail, who incorporates her African-American church music background, and Ben Arnold, a Columbia recording artist whose gritty vocal style is reminiscent of Bob Dylan or Tom Waits. His heady material ranges from songs about the cost of war to cigarette addiction.</p>
        <p>The nonprofit regional arts center is situated on 60 of the 176 acres of Appel Farm. Local farmers are allowed to farm on the remaining acreage. The center began as an arts and summer camp in 1959, and 15 years ago it began expanding into a full-fledged arts center.</p>
        <p>The organization presents concerts, family and children's theater, and a public school arts program. They are now in the process of building a Fine Arts Center, which Mr. Timmons said, ''Will lead to the next level of art classes and workshops for adults and kids.''</p>
        <p>And songwriters like those performing at the festival, he said, will continue to be the backbone of Appel Farm.</p>
