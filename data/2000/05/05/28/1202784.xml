        <p>A COLLEGE classmate living in Arizona said he was going to Montana in July to canoe along Lewis and Clark's route on the Upper Missouri River.

        <p>A COLLEGE classmate living in Arizona said he was going to Montana in July to canoe along Lewis and Clark's route on the Upper Missouri River. Though I had heard only part of the tape of Stephen E. Ambrose's best-selling biography of Meriwether Lewis, ''Undaunted Courage,'' I was envious.</p>
        <p>My classmate is not alone in heading for the Lewis and Clark wilderness: Lee V. Larson, a spokesman for the Bureau of Land Management, which is responsible for the portion protected as the Upper Missouri Wild and Scenic River, said that Dr. Ambrose's book had stimulated trips on the 149-mile stretch.</p>
        <p>On other waters all over North America, others are taking up the same idea in increasing numbers:  canoeing, rafting and kayaking are enjoying a major surge of popularity. Try this: In Alaska there will be midnight rafting down the Nenana River at the edge of Denali National Park from June 17 to June 23. The moon will be full on the 16th, but no matter: close to the North Pole at the solstice, the sun will be above the horizon for nearly 21 hours. In the weird dusk, those on the rafts will glimpse rapids and canyons on a two-hour trip before a very early breakfast at the McKinley Chalet Resort along the Nenana.</p>
        <p>And Butterfield &amp; Robinson of Toronto, a noted operator of bicycling and walking trips with luxury accommodations, has a new venture, Rivers and Oceans, which is offering six river and hiking trips in remote parts of the Canadian Northwest. Some enter areas where only this company has permission to go.</p>
        <p>The Alaska midnight rafting is offered by the concession holder at the park, Denali Park Resorts; Butterfield &amp; Robinson is likewise well established. But most people who want to kayak or canoe far from home start from scratch in finding an outfitter unless they have a friend's recommendation. Twice, I have called upon outfitters and have not taken the trip because the employees seemed vague on pick-up timing or I objected to something in the documents I was to sign. More than is the case with a hotel or a cruise, travelers entrust their lives to outfitters.</p>
        <p>River Surfing</p>
        <p>My college friend, Dr. Richard Oliver, is using a small family-owned company in Anaconda, Mont., Upper Missouri River Guides, that he learned about through its Web page, www.uppermissouri.com. Glenn Monahan, the owner, is a retired teacher who focuses on geology and elects to pitch some camps at Lewis and Clark's historic campsites. Mr. Monahan has also written a guide to the river keyed to the Bureau of Land Management maps.</p>
        <p>The Web is increasingly used to find small companies, but the electronic woods are filled with rogues.  In the case of outfitters that operate in federal lands or waters, like Mr. Monahan's, there is at least minimal protection: areas under the jurisdiction of any of eight agencies, including the National Park Service, the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, require outfitters to get permits annually.</p>
        <p>Mr. Larson of the Bureau of Land Management said: ''We have a fairly comprehensive list of stipulations -- safety requirements, food handling, credentials of the boatmen.'' Three broad goals are involved, he said: safety of the participants, preservation of public health and protection of natural resources.</p>
        <p>A list of recreation areas on Federal lands is available at www .recreation.gov. This does not list operators, although camping reservations links are provided.</p>
        <p>Most states license guides and outfitters, and shoppers should ask companies if they have licenses. A small book, ''Top Rated River Adventures: Canoeing, Kayaking and Rafting in North America'' (Picked-by-You Guides, $18.95, www.topguides.com), notes any licensing requirements in the 14 states it includes, and gives addresses for agencies or associations. (Entries in this book are written by the outfitters themselves; the explanation of the editor's selection method should be examined.)</p>
        <p>Some semiofficial agencies provide a list small enough to check out by phone. In Fort Benton, Mont., at the first section of the Wild and Scenic Upper Missouri, for example, the visitor center, (406) 622-3864, maintains a list of only six river outfitters.</p>
        <p>Sometimes, experienced kayakers or canoers simply want to rent boats in a remote state. Outfitters may have arrangements for this, but of necessity the rental is probably also going to involve being dropped off and picked up, so costs and schedules should be discussed.</p>
        <p>Almost all outfitters want participants to sign agreements acknowledging the ''inherent dangers'' in their activities. The Butterfield &amp; Robinson Rivers and Oceans catalogue is blunt: ''All of the trips in this brochure . . . entail risk of personal injury or death from accident, illness or the conduct of other persons. . . . Medical facilities may not be easily accessible and may not be sophisticated.''</p>
        <p>Watch for Waivers</p>
        <p>Sometimes, outfitters also ask clients to sign a waiver asserting that the operator may not be sued even in the event of gross negligence. Cindy Orlando, chief of concessions for the National Park Service in Washington, said such waivers were legally unenforceable and not consistent with National Park policy. She said that permit holders had to carry liability insurance appropriate for the type of activity and the number of clients, and that where boating was involved, Coast Guard regulations applied.</p>
        <p>America Outdoors, an association of 500 outfitters with headquarters in Knoxville, Tenn., maintains its membership list on the Web at www .americaoutdoors.org. David L. Brown, the executive director, said that its group has a code of ethics, but that when complaints were received, it referred them to the agencies or states that licensed the operators. Mr. Brown said his organization did not have a standard waiver of liability and that most waivers used by operators were created by insurance companies.</p>
        <p>The group's membership list is free from (865) 558-3597, or America Outdoors, Post Office Box 10847, Knoxville, Tenn. 37939. The Web list is updated regularly.</p>
        <p>Fifty-five operators organized as the Colorado River Outfitters Association maintain their list at www.croa.org. John Rice, president of the group, said members paid dues and subscribed to a code of ethics. He said that there were 150 outfitters licensed by the state, but that some were very small. A members' list leaflet is available from Post Office Box 1662, Buena Vista, Colo. 81211.</p>
        <p>A more sophisticated step is represented by www.adventureseek.com. This Web site of 230 operators includes many big names, including Mountain Travel-Sobek, OARS and Backroads. According to Jeff Kinder, a founder and vice president, adventureseek works on the travel agent system: it gets a commission for each booking. Client evaluations will be carried on the site. Reservations can be made on line, by e-mail, on a hypertext link or by phone.</p>
        <p>There are a number of other adventure travel sites, but the content is vast and the material overlaps. For example, Tim Gordon of Gordonsguide in Fresno, Calif., says that www.gordonsguide.com, has 800 outfitters listed, who pay an annual fee to be included. Other big sites are www.away.com, www.greatoutdoors .com, www.iexplore.com and www .gorp.com, which is short for Great Outdoor Recreation Pages. Activities like camping, canoeing or fishing can be searched on www.gorp, which seems to include almost everything.</p>
        <p>The night whitewater trip in Alaska, offered this year for the first time by Denali Park Resorts, a division of Aramark, will be able to accommodate 32 people nightly in four rafts, with a guide in each. The trip is described as quite wet; the 11-mile course includes stretches labeled Splatter Rock and the Narrows. The minimum age is 10, and the cost is $72 a person, including breakfast. For reservations, call (800) 276-7234; for information, visit www.denali  nationalpark.com.</p>
        <p>The new Butterfield &amp; Robinson trips, on largely uninhabited water systems like the Klinaklini in British Columbia, require a lot of logistics, including helicopter lifts. For all the rugged surroundings, Butterfield &amp; Robinson continues its emphasis on supersoft nights: wine, tents you can stand in, towels and real glasses are shipped ahead on cargo rafts, the company says.</p>
        <p>Rivers and Oceans Unlimited Expeditions merged with Butterfield &amp; Robinson to set up these new trips,  which travel through provincial parks and private lands that cannot accommodate vehicles</p>
        <p>The trips range from $2,350 to $4,950 a person for six nights. Information and catalogues: 70 Bond Street, Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5B 1X3; (800) 678-1147; www .butterfield.com.</p>
        <p>Upper Missouri River Guides can be reached at 315 West Fourth Street, Anaconda, Mont. 59711 and (406) 563-2770, as well as at www .uppermissouri.com. The 46-mile, three-night White Cliffs Tour, by canoe from Coal Banks to Judith Landing, Mont., costs $735 a person, meals included.</p>
        <p>Float trips like this one on Class I rivers, with no rapids, are safe enough for young children, but parents should discuss any river trip carefully with an outfitter, and appraise their children's tolerance for being confined for hours at a time in what they may consider boring circumstances.</p>
