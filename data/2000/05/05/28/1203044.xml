        <p>A new type of outdoor advertising has sparked preservation concerns among community groups and city landmark officials.</p>
        <p>In the last few months, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority has installed back-lighted advertising panels above subway entrances throughout the city. But some signs were erected in designated historic districts, where exterior alterations require approval in advance by the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission.</p>
        <p>Most recently, illuminated advertisements have been attached to the four cast-iron entrances of the Prince Street station,  on Broadway within the SoHo-Cast Iron Historic District. At a meeting this month, the Landmarks Commission asked the M.T.A. to remove the panels from the Prince Street station and from the Sheridan Square and 14th Street stations in the Greenwich Village Historic District.</p>
        <p>At issue is whether the space where the signs have been installed falls under the jurisdiction of the Landmarks Commission or the M.T.A.</p>
        <p>According to Terri Rosen Deutsch, ''Anything in a historic district falls within'' the commission's jurisdiction. She pointed out that many subway stations are landmarks, although this one is not.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rosen Deutsch said the commission has regulated other types of street furniture with advertisements, including bus shelters and telephone booths, although she acknowledged that it was unclear exactly who had  jurisdiction over the space.</p>
        <p>But Tom Kelly, an M.T.A. spokesman, disagreed. ''This is our system,'' he said. ''From the staircase down, it belongs to the M.T.A.''</p>
        <p>Several hundred of these signs are being installed as part of a citywide subway improvement plan. The new signs are expected to generate $8 million in annual revenues.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelly said the M.T.A. hoped to work with the Landmarks Commission and local groups on this issue. He noted that an illuminated sign at the 81st Street station, which falls within a historic district, was removed after preservation groups complained.</p>
        <p>Some residents see the ads as another victory for sidewalk commercialization.</p>
        <p>''You can't have a leisurely stroll without being pounded by advertising,'' said Sean Sweeney, executive director of the SoHo Alliance.</p>
