        <p>The New York Senate race has been transformed from a narrow battle over a tiny number of undecided voters into a broad and complex contest, with voting blocs and geographic regions that had seemed fixed in place suddenly churned into play by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's departure, Republican and Democratic strategists say.</p>
        <p>Aides to Representative Rick A. Lazio, the Republican candidate, and Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democrat, said that since the political calculus of the race has now been scrambled, they have been forced to change tactics and abandon long-held assumptions -- that Mrs. Clinton would be an unusually strong candidate upstate, for example, or that Mr. Giuliani would encroach on Democratic voting blocs.</p>
        <p>This is one reason Mrs. Clinton, in making her first campaign appearance after Mr. Lazio completed his announcement tour last week, did so in Westchester County, before an audience of elderly voters.</p>
        <p>The suburbs now seem at least slightly more hospitable to Mrs. Clinton with Mr. Giuliani out of the race, and the elderly, always among the most dutiful voters come Election Day, have been identified by Mrs. Clinton's advisers as more open to her appeal.</p>
        <p>Similarly, Mr. Lazio, once he concludes his acceptance speech at the Republican convention in Buffalo on Tuesday, plans to make a theatrical departure in a bus caravan, which will roll through the small towns and farmlands of upstate New York for two full days. It will be the second time that the new candidate has turned up in a part of the state where Mr. Giuliani had rarely been seen. And plans call for Mr. Lazio to make a concerted appeal both to moderate and even conservative voters, who some upstate Republicans feared had been alienated by both Mr. Giuliani's manner and the public unraveling of his marriage.</p>
        <p>In some ways, the calculations evident in the candidates' schedules show how much this has reverted to a traditional race for Senate, though one including a first lady. Both sides are relying on historical models in trying to assemble winning coalitions, based on appeals to different parts of the state and different voting groups. But after months in which Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Giuliani courted a state in which most voters seemed firmly set in their positions, both campaigns have concluded that Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Lazio are now facing a vastly more complex and fluid political picture.</p>
        <p>Aides to both candidates agreed, to a striking extent, on the ways the political deck had been reshuffled. Not surprisingly, they disagreed on which of the two candidates would benefit from it, and both claimed the advantage. The advisers said that any polls measuring the support of Mr. Lazio this early were almost certainly unreliable, given the tumult caused by Mr. Giuliani's leaving the race, and the short time Mr. Lazio has been on the stage.</p>
        <p>The clearest shift is the changing assessments by Republicans and Democrats of which regions favor which candidates.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Giuliani was in the race, upstate New York had seemed to be unusually strong ground for Mrs. Clinton, a matter of some concern for Republican leaders, because upstate has always provided the electoral base for Republicans, a counter to the advantage Democrats have in New York City.</p>
        <p>Her appeal upstate was the result of both Mrs. Clinton's frequent visits there and the problems inherent in running a New York City mayor for office in a part of the state that has always viewed the city with deep suspicion. Several upstate Republicans said last week that Mr. Giuliani's chances would have been further eroded by the revelations about his marriage, and that before he quit, they had grown more pessimistic about how he would do there against Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio is now planning what aides said would be a summer-long charge to recapture that part of the state, and upstate Republicans have cheered the end of the turmoil that had clouded their party and are pleased that their candidate is a Long Island congressman rather than a New York City mayor. ''There is almost a sigh of relief,'' said Senator Thomas W. Libous, a Republican of Binghamton and a senior adviser to Mr. Lazio. ''No question: upstate is back in play.''</p>
        <p>Even some of Mrs. Clinton's advisers acknowledged that Mr. Lazio could be much more attractive to upstate voters than the mayor, and that he was already showing a level of interest in the contest that Mr. Giuliani never had. Still, Mrs. Clinton's campaign manager, Bill de Blasio, said he was not worried. ''Hillary has spent so much time upstate that Lazio will not find it easy to cut into her support there,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That said, Mrs. Clinton may now find that opportunities lost upstate might be opportunities gained in the suburbs. The counties around New York City had been extremely supportive of Mr. Giuliani's candidacy, testimony both to his nightly dominance of television news and the credit suburban voters gave Mr. Giuliani for the improved fortunes of a city where so many of them go for work and pleasure.</p>
        <p>Now the race has, however improbably, turned into a contest between two suburban candidates, one from Suffolk County on Long Island who is barely known outside his district, and the other a first lady who lives, at least sometimes, in Westchester. Mrs. Clinton spent two days campaigning in the suburbs last week, and she plans to return to Westchester for an event marking Memorial Day tomorrow.</p>
        <p>As a final matter of geography, Mr. Lazio is unlikely to have the level of support Mr. Giuliani would have drawn in New York City. He will probably spend a minimal amount of time there, both in response to the emerging political reality of this state, and because he will not want to do anything to remind Mrs. Clinton's voters to turn out.</p>
        <p>The roles of nearly all the major New York voting blocs -- blacks, women, Jews and gays in particular -- have shifted almost as suddenly as the geography, though not as clearly.</p>
        <p>Most obviously, advisers to both candidates have concluded that Mrs. Clinton cannot count on the large turnout among black voters that seemed likely with Mr. Giuliani at the top of the ticket. Republicans argued that Mrs. Clinton would have to spend more time in New York City to ensure that Democratic voters turn out.</p>
        <p>''When the race was against the mayor, there was a guaranteed base of voters that would vote against him,'' said Zenia Mucha, the senior adviser to Gov. George E. Pataki. ''That is no longer the case. Mrs. Clinton will now have to spend an enormous amount of time and energy making a case for herself with the voters that were against the mayor.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Mrs. Clinton may now have an opening to voters who have tended to be Democratic but with whom Mr. Giuliani was competitive -- in particular, Jewish voters, the elderly, gays and women. For one thing, Mr. Lazio is a more traditional Republican than the moderate mayor, and for another, Mrs. Clinton's advisers hope to use Mr. Lazio's voting record in Congress against him with those groups.</p>
        <p>Last week, for example, Mrs. Clinton noted Mr. Lazio's opposition to gun control and to public financing of abortions for the poor, both issues that could help the first lady's problematic standing with female voters. Aides said that in the weeks ahead she would point to cuts in Medicare supported by Congressional Republicans in an attempt to challenge Mr. Lazio's position with the elderly.</p>
        <p>To strengthen her support among gay voters, they said, Mrs. Clinton would note that he had not been a cosponsor of federal gay rights legislation or the hate-crimes bill.</p>
        <p>Finally, both sides believe that Jewish voters, whose support for Mr. Giuliani had been a constant source of concern for Mrs. Clinton, may have shifted to at least undecided ground. ''Let's face it: that was a tough nut to crack,'' an adviser to Mrs. Clinton said. ''I think now it's a much more open situation.''</p>
        <p>It may not be that easy. Mr. Giuliani's support among many Jewish voters was a product both of the perception that he was strong on Israeli security, and of Mrs. Clinton's perceived sympathy toward the creation of a Palestinian state.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 29, 2000, Monday  A front-page article yesterday about the United States Senate race in New York referred incorrectly to the views of the Republican candidate, Rick A. Lazio, on gun control. While he opposes a proposal made by his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, to register new handguns and license new gun users, he supports the Brady Bill, which requires background checks for gun buyers, and a ban on some forms of assault weapons. He does not oppose all forms of gun control.</p>
