        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Louis Uchitelle almost, but not quite, gets his economic arms around Robert J. Shiller's ''Irrational Exuberance'' (May 7). The stock market has been more volatile than usual, but that does not mean it is behaving irrationally. Uchitelle says, ''Most economists assume that people are rational and fully informed, and that their stock investments reflect a realistic assessment of the economy.'' Not so. Most economists may believe people act rationally, but few believe investors are ''fully informed.''</p>

        <p>Louis Uchitelle almost, but not quite, gets his economic arms around Robert J. Shiller's ''Irrational Exuberance'' (May 7). The stock market has been more volatile than usual, but that does not mean it is behaving irrationally. Uchitelle says, ''Most economists assume that people are rational and fully informed, and that their stock investments reflect a realistic assessment of the economy.'' Not so. Most economists may believe people act rationally, but few believe investors are ''fully informed.''</p>
        <p>They can't possibly be, which is why they follow opinion leaders who try to be fully informed. Some follow the bullish leaders and some follow the bears, and the market that comprises them is more efficient in setting prices than they are. Uchitelle notes that Shiller himself allows that steep market expansions unwind ''when something scares the investors.'' It is the task of market analysts to figure out what will scare the bulls and what will scare the bears. Sometimes it takes only a rumor to start a stampede of bears or bulls, but when the truth arrives, ''rationality'' is re-established.</p>
