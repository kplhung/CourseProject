        <p>When Guy Williams Jr., son of the dashing, swashbuckling actor who played Zorro in the television series that began in 1957, learned that his father would be inducted posthumously into the Bronx Walk of Fame, he decided to make a trip to the city his father had spoken of fondly.</p>
        <p>One of his father's fans, Wendell Vega, learned of Mr. Williams's trip from Los Angeles, and invited him to stay in his home in the Parkchester section.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams found not only an ardent admirer, but also one of the  largest collections of Zorro memorabilia, including lunch boxes, figurines, children's costumes, a Viewmaster with 3-D cartridge, board games, puppets, record albums, talcum powder and, of course, toy swords. Mr. Vega estimated the collection was worth $20,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams also found a seemingly endless source of information about his own life.</p>
        <p>''If I need to know my birthday, I ask him,'' said Mr. Williams, who is an actor and often appears at Zorro conventions and at events to commemorate other roles his father held, like Prof. John Robinson in the late 60's television show ''Lost in Space.''</p>
        <p>''You have maybe three people in the word who have this kind of collection,'' Mr. Williams said.</p>
        <p>The elder Mr. Williams was born Joseph Armando Catalano, in the Kingsbridge Terrace section of the Bronx, and attended George Washington High School in Washington Heights. In 1989, at 65, he died of a cerebral hemorrhage in Buenos Aires.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vega, an emergency medical technician, said he became fascinated with Zorro as a boy, and was particularly drawn to Mr. Williams's portrayal even though it was Douglas Fairbanks who originated the role in the 1920 film ''The Mark of Zorro.''</p>
        <p>''What captured me wasn't so much the costume but the actor Guy Williams himself, the way he projected the character as an honest and caring person,'' he said. The son has the same traits, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams decided to stay a week longer than he had planned, to accompany Mr. Vega to places  where his father lived, worked and played. He said it was strange to observe Mr. Vega's almost obsessive fascination with his father.</p>
        <p>''But it makes sense because, for people of that age, Zorro was huge,'' he added. ''I remember when I was a kid we were literally chased down by mobs of people.</p>
        <p>''And today, I go to conventions where children from 5 years old are there with their parents and grandparents. It's neat to me that three generations can bond over the same thing.''</p>
