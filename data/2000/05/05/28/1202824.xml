        <p>THERE are two mistakes about music in Saul Bellow's new novel, ''Ravelstein.'' Although what constitutes a mistake in a work of fiction is something that will require a little commentary.

        <p>THERE are two mistakes about music in Saul Bellow's new novel, ''Ravelstein.'' Although what constitutes a mistake in a work of fiction is something that will require a little commentary. As readers may know, the title character is based on Allan Bloom, Mr. Bellow's friend and colleague at the University of Chicago, who became an international celebrity with the publication of ''The Closing of the American Mind'' in 1987. Bloom died in 1992.</p>
        <p>The first anomaly comes just after Ravelstein, in a luxurious Paris hotel, has shared an elevator with Michael Jackson. A passage describes Ravelstein as ''the man at the private command post of telephones,'' a near quotation from Mr. Bellow's eulogy for Bloom, and continues with the image of ''flashing lights and state-of-the-art stereo playing Palestrina on the original instruments.''</p>
        <p>This seems a perfect match of high culture and politics until one realizes that the notion of Palestrina on original instruments is preposterous (unless one imagines surgical procedures designed to make the members of a modern chorus sound like 16th-century singers). The instrumental works of Palestrina are, like the operas of Brahms or the string quartets of Chopin, musical unicorns.</p>
        <p>Now, such a gaffe (if it is not some elaborate in-joke) would hardly be significant but for the fact that the novel is in part a celebration of the elite, discerning taste and superior intellect and knowledge of the title character, who is, not incidentally, trying to rescue society from philistinism. If the opening of the American mind depends on someone who listens to a cappella music on original instruments, we may be in serious trouble.</p>
        <p>But whose mistake is this? If, as is most probable, the flub is Mr. Bellow's, it is merely a little sad. In honoring his friend, the author carelessly makes him appear a phony to those (few?) who know Palestrina. It is as if, in the passages celebrating Ravelstein's love for the Chicago Bulls, he had written, ''He loved it when Michael Jordan hung in the air and slam-dunked a 3-point shot off the glass.''</p>
        <p>Still, we are dealing with a novel, and it is possible that the gaffe was actually made by the fictional Chick, Ravelstein's somewhat reluctant biographer and Mr. Bellow's shadow. If so, the ''error'' represents the highest level of literary virtuosity. Throughout the novel, Chick accepts his inferiority to Ravelstein in matters of taste. At one point, he realizes that Ravelstein ''wouldn't dress a dummy'' in a suit made for Chick by his tailor. How touching, brilliant and appropriate if Chick got the music all wrong!</p>
        <p>There is not much chance that Ravelstein himself made the mistake. If that were the case, it would constitute the direst kind of criticism by the author (either Chick or Mr. Bellow), implying that the hero's supposed command of the finer things was merely a pose and a sham. Here the related notions of ''original,''  ''authentic'' and ''pure'' associated with the chic propaganda of the early-music movement would be turned on their heads. Whatever the case, it is unlikely that Ravelstein's model, Bloom, would ever have made such a mistake; those who knew him report that he was a great musical aficionado, especially of bel canto singing.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the world of bel canto opera enters into the other musical conundrum. It occurs at the end of the novel, as Chick envisions Ravelstein, now dead, in all his transcendent splendor, dressing and smoking.</p>
        <p>''The cast and orchestra are pouring out the 'Italian Maiden in Algiers,' '' Mr. Bellow writes. ''This is dressing music, accessory or mood music, but Ravelstein takes a Nietzschean view, favorable to comedy and bandstands. Better Bizet and 'Carmen' than Wagner and the 'Ring.' He likes the volume of his powerful set turned up to the maximum. . . . Perhaps he relishes having so many instruments serenading him, so many musicians in attendance. . . .</p>
        <p>'' 'What do you think of this recording, Chick?' he says. 'They're playing the original ancient 17th-century instruments.' ''</p>
        <p>Not to put too fine a point on it, Rossini's delightful ''Italiana in Algeri'' was first performed in 1813. This may be only half a mistake. The glowing coda of ''Ravelstein'' may possibly be thought of as otherworldly. Perhaps in heaven, all things come together as one, and they do play Rossini on 17th-century instruments (and I would love to hear it). But once again, we are left with the image of our hero, this meticulous larger-than-life figure, this quintessence of good taste, caught in a precious oversight, made only worse by the unnecessary word ''ancient.''</p>
        <p>''Ravelstein'' is fiction of course, not fact. It is a sad and sometimes beautiful book, the work of a master. Far from encouraging us to point fingers at author or subject, these musical uncertainties seem to enhance the sense of loss at the novel's core. Fact or fiction, one of the people involved does not know his music, but we don't know which one, and we probably never will.</p>
        <p>A final musical comment: interpreting the names of characters in a novel is to literary investigation what the pun is to humor. Yet the name Ravelstein is peculiar. (Unlike Mr. Bellow's earlier Herzog, Humboldt, Sammler and Henderson, it does not appear in any telephone directories at hand.) It could mean nothing, or it could refer to some process by which Chick ''reveals,'' or ''unravels,'' his subject.</p>
        <p>Then again, I cannot help remembering one of Bloom's most notorious passages in ''The Closing of the American Mind.'' After suggesting provocatively, and perhaps unnecessarily, that young people know that ''rock has the beat of sexual intercourse,'' he continued: ''That is why Ravel's 'Bolero' is one piece of classical music that is commonly known and liked by them.''  Stein, in German, means rock.</p>
        <p>Hats off, then, to Ravel(stein)! To Bloom, Chick and Mr. Bellow! And hats off to music! What else could be so obscure yet so revealing.</p>
