        <p>There is a new battlefront between tenants and landlords. It is 200 pages of dense legalese quietly created by New York State officials to rewrite the rent regulations that cover 2.4 million residents, most of them in New York City, and that document has caused a furor.</p>
        <p>The State Division of Housing and Community Renewal says that it is simply updating the rules to conform to laws, court decisions and regulatory directives since the last codification, in 1987.</p>

        <p>There is a new battlefront between tenants and landlords. It is 200 pages of dense legalese quietly created by New York State officials to rewrite the rent regulations that cover 2.4 million residents, most of them in New York City, and that document has caused a furor.</p>
        <p>The State Division of Housing and Community Renewal says that it is simply updating the rules to conform to laws, court decisions and regulatory directives since the last codification, in 1987.</p>
        <p>But tenant groups accuse the state of making changes that favor landlords and undermine key protections for renters; changes for which, they say, there is no statutory authority. They say the changes will enable owners to raise rents improperly and to evict tenants.</p>
        <p>But the housing agency's general counsel, Marcia P. Hirsch, denies those claims. The updating is required by law, she said, and the proposal clarifies numerous issues, including some that are being contested in court.</p>
        <p>Although the state has not yet formally adopted the revised regulations, tenant leaders say they are preparing to challenge them in court. ''There's no question that we're going to be suing to stop this,'' said Michael McKee, associate director of the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, which represents 17,000 individuals and 144 affiliated groups.</p>
        <p>Sharp debate characterized public hearings on the issue Thursday in Manhattan, White Plains and Manhasset. Most of the rent-regulated apartments are in New York City, but about 70,000 are in Nassau, Westchester and Rockland Counties.</p>
        <p>Landlords gave qualified supported to the proposal, but called for additional modifications.</p>
        <p>''For both owners and tenants, this codification is an extremely valuable and useful process'' because it consolidates all the rules in one place, said Joseph Strasburg, president of the city's largest landlord group, the Rent Stabilization Association, which represents 25,000 owners and managers. ''The bottom line is that there is nothing new here.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Strasburg urged several changes, including removing the time limit on when an owner can challenge whether the tenant whose name appears on a lease is really living in an apartment, and allowing owners to charge more than one month's rent as a security deposit.</p>
        <p>Tenants' advocates adamantly opposed the changes in the revision, and accused the state of pushing the changes through without sufficient public review.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKee linked the state agency's changes to an effort three years ago by the State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, to eliminate rent stabilization. Gov. George E. Pataki eventually forged a compromise between Mr. Bruno and tenant groups that was perceived as a defeat for Republicans. But Mr. McKee called the latest move an attempt ''to achieve pro-landlord changes that George Elmer Pataki could not win from the State Legislature in 1997.''</p>
        <p>The tenants' advocates said that the hearings were not well publicized, that the proposal was not advertised and that copies of the draft were not available at the hearings.  ''How can I comment on your proposed code when I don't have a copy?'' asked Pat McGovern, a tenant from Manhattan. ''I asked for a copy at the desk, and they said they would mail me one.''</p>
        <p>Despite the proposal's length, speakers were limited to five minutes each and were barred from proposing further changes, although that rule was ignored.</p>
        <p>''This is a landlord's wish list,'' said David Robinson, a lawyer for Legal Services for New York City, a nonprofit advocacy group. ''I looked through 125 pages and found one page of protection for tenants.''</p>
        <p>City Councilman Stanley E. Michels, a Democrat from Manhattan, said: ''This is a travesty. You are trying to destroy what's left of rent control and rent stabilization.''</p>
        <p>One surprise speaker at the Manhattan session was the head of the union that represents the housing agency's 475 employees in New York City, Ralph F. Carbone, president of Local 1359 of District Council 37. Mr. Carbone said that he was impartial in disputes between between landlords and tenants, but that he felt compelled to speak.</p>
        <p>''I found that the proposals were slanted significantly toward owners,'' he said, ''going beyond what I believe the current state law and judicial precedents are.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 6, 2000, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, an article on May 28 about proposed rent regulation changes drafted by New York State officials referred incorrectly to comments by a tenant advocate, Michael McKee. Mr. McKee accused Gov. George E. Pataki and his administration of trying to undercut rent regulation but did not link the Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, to the proposals.</p>
