        <p>EAST MORICHES has never been known as a dining destination. The White Truffle Inn may change that. This charming newcomer is worth the trip.</p>
        <p>Picture a large, white, sprawling Victorian house set in its own garden beside Montauk Highway. Inside, couples and groups of three will find prime seating in big white wicker chairs at small tables on the gracious enclosed porch. The main dining room also has appeal: shiny floors, antique fireplace and sideboard, period light fixtures and bouquets of fresh flowers. Tables sport down-to-the-floor cloths and are graced with thin long-stem goblets and pink glass lanterns.</p>

        <p>EAST MORICHES has never been known as a dining destination. The White Truffle Inn may change that. This charming newcomer is worth the trip.</p>
        <p>Picture a large, white, sprawling Victorian house set in its own garden beside Montauk Highway. Inside, couples and groups of three will find prime seating in big white wicker chairs at small tables on the gracious enclosed porch. The main dining room also has appeal: shiny floors, antique fireplace and sideboard, period light fixtures and bouquets of fresh flowers. Tables sport down-to-the-floor cloths and are graced with thin long-stem goblets and pink glass lanterns.</p>
        <p>There is a super waitress here.  One weeknight, she, along with a busgirl, handled the entire room. The kitchen, however, was bogged down and there were long waits between courses. On a busy Saturday, the dining room was filled with servers and the kitchen kept pace. Members of that auxiliary dining room crew, while pleasant and well meaning, were a bit green. They were unsure where to deliver dishes and vague about ingredients.</p>
        <p>The first bites of the meal are of warm homemade rolls straight from the oven. They are escorted by a silver-domed butter dish. (No foil-wrapped butter pats here.) The final tastes are equally impressive. Every dessert is splendid. The homemade treats include a light but rich flourless chocolate cake that is world-class; a delicious, firm chocolate mousse; and classic crepes suzette.  Eating floating island, mounds of meringue adrift on creme anglaise all covered with a spun sugar cage, was like devouring clouds. Just as appealing was a napoleon of light puff pastry, whipped cream and fresh berries.</p>
        <p>The creator of these dreamy delights is Nohemi Cuenca, the pastry chef and co-owner of the restaurant.  The other owner is her husband, Osvaldo, the executive chef. His dishes are sometimes a match for her achievements, but there are a few also-rans. One evening we had a near-perfect meal; another night there were a number of missteps.</p>
        <p>We were disappointed with the very ordinary lobster bisque and vegetable pistou. Both were underseasoned. Escargots also lacked punch. Coquille St.-Jacques, a melange of scallops, mushrooms and shrimp, was overwhelmed by its bed of bland mashed potatoes. And fried oysters, encircling fresh spinach, tasted strong and old.</p>
        <p>Still, the portobello mushroom napoleon, layered with other warm grilled vegetables and topped with a fresh orange-tomato salsa, was top-notch. So too was delicate gravlax placed over puff pastry and enhanced with a mustard-dill sauce.  The shrimp cocktail, five firm shrimp in a satin-glass dish, is everything it should be.</p>
        <p>Most of the entrees pass muster.  We loved the seared foie gras in a Champagne vinaigrette that shared the plate with arugula and figs. Also worthy was roast duck with crisp skin, tender meat, an orange-cranberry sauce and a wild-rice griddle cake. Two beef selections drew raves: steak au poivre in brandy cream sauce and a filet mignon special in a mustard-Burgundy sauce.  Salmon a la Greque, with a topping of tomatoes, eggplant and artichoke hearts, was cooked with a light hand.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cuenca, who hails from Argentina, has included two dishes from his homeland on the mainly French menu. Argentine cannelloni stuffed with Swiss chard, ground veal and ricotta, napped with bechamel and tomato sauces, has plenty of verve.  The Argentine mixed grill was truly mixed. The chicken breast in the assembly was dry and the short ribs were chewy. The grilled double-cut lamb chop, however, was succulent and the sausage and meat-filled empanadas were tasty.</p>
        <p>While a meal could be as mixed as the mixed grill, with careful choosing diners can enjoy a first-class dinner at this gracious restaurant.</p>
