        <p>IT all begins with just one person. And from that person, a play grows.</p>
        <p>That's William Mastrosimone's first step. He calls it character.</p>
        <p>With ''Blinding Light,'' which is to have its first preview on June 7 at the Passage Theater in Trenton, character is as far as he wants to take it.</p>
        <p>Anyone who meets Mr. Mastrosimone is ''automatically a candidate for a monologue or a scene,'' in his words.</p>
        <p>In Penn Station, Mr. Mastrosimone watched a maintenance woman, never looking up. He acknowledged her. They talked. In ''Blinding Light,'' she talks alone. Her name is Chris. ''I needed to examine this person,'' Mr. Mastrosimone said. ''I put myself inside her skin.''</p>
        <p>What then is ''Blinding Light?'' For the theatergoer who needs a label, it is a series of monologues and dialogues; there were 11 at last count. ''We'll probably end up with nine,'' the playwright said, still sweating it out. During one of several telephone conversations from his home in Enumclaw, Wash., he settled for calling ''Blinding Light,'' a series of playlets, or scenes, but prefers ''an evening of theater.''</p>
        <p>Given the blurring of definitions in the performing arts, the 52-year-old  Mr. Mastrosimone, commonly called Trenton's native son, said he is still looking for clarity -- after all these years. Since his breakthrough play in 1980 -- ''Extremities,'' set between Princeton and Trenton ''where the cornfield meets the highway'' -- his ouevre, including screenplays, television plays and mini-series, has been prodigious.</p>
        <p>''What exactly is an evening of theater?'' he asked. Here, a return to and investigation of process in terms of a succession of separate scenes, signifies a departure for a playwright, but hardly a new format for the theater.</p>
        <p>And that process, Mr. Mastrosimone calls painterly. ''In a portrait, you can't see facts or a person's history, only the results of that history in their faces, their eyes,'' he said. ''So you ruminate about lives that come from the catching of a moment.''</p>
        <p>It is the catching of a moment that Mr. Mastrosimone has developed into a technique, or at least a survival mechanism. It gets him through a bad day ''when you wake up and can't write, but you have to get it done,'' he said, ''you need a method, and I have the bio of a character. I hear voices. I take dictation.</p>
        <p>Forget details. Let instinct and invention take over. That's the Mastrosimone method, and he has now turned that method into an evening of theater. ''The ability to write a character is the ability to predict,'' he added.</p>
        <p>The title piece has been most anxiety-ridden for the author. ''It's the longest and the toughest,'' he said, determined not to get on the red-eye to Newark Airport until he finished it. ''It is about the pain and the changes in a relationship,'' Mr. Mastrosimone said. ''And most people don't want the truth. They prefer illusion. They believe in the power of denial. But when you tell the truth, and tell it well, they will come and they will listen.''</p>
        <p>If the evening has a connective theme, it is ''unspeakable loneliness,'' the playwright said. ''These are not pretty stories. They are about people trapped, people I meet in life. All my work is about captivity.''</p>
        <p>In rehearsal in lower Manhattan last week, four actors and the director, Julie Boyd, received faxed pages of the script that bears the evening's name, while doing a ''stumble-through,'' as the stage manager Liz Miller put it, of the others.</p>
        <p>The piece charts 60 years in the lives of a man and a woman -- in 20 minutes. A literal airplane trip turns into a metaphor for life's passages: meeting, marriage, parenthood, separation, reconciliation, death.</p>
        <p>But it's only a scene.</p>
