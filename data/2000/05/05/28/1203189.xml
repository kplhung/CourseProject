        <p>New York Knickerbockers center Patrick Ewing is unable to play in game 3 of Eastern Conference Finals against Indiana Pacers because of an injury, and Marcus Camby sprains ankle during game, but Pacers are unable to capitalize and lose to Knicks, 98-95 (M)</p>

        <p>There was already a hole in the middle with Patrick Ewing dressed in a gray suit and on the bench instead of in his blue, white and orange Knicks uniform, instead of his being in the middle of this desperate reach to make this series tighter and longer. After the first quarter, the Knicks were 5 points ahead of Indiana, and it looked as if the Pacers might slip against a quicker but definitely smaller Knicks team.</p>
        <p>And then Marcus Camby went down and out with a sprained knee midway through the second quarter.</p>
        <p>It was as if the Pacers began drooling. Rubbing their palms with glee and anticipation. Sharpening their carving knives. All eyes on the prey. They would swoosh down on the Knicks like a hawk on a rabbit.</p>
        <p>The Knicks resembled a doughnut -- a team with a hole squarely in the middle.</p>
        <p>But Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals at Madison Square Garden yesterday showed that with or without Ewing, this should be a series that is tighter and longer. After the Knicks had won, 98-95, to close Indiana's series lead to two games to one, familiar questions arose.</p>
        <p>How much better do the Knicks play without Ewing? How far do they go without him? And do the Pacers possess enough fire to not only win the series but to also prevent it from reaching a seventh game, a last-shot free-for-all in which the winner would advance to the National Basketball Association finals?</p>
        <p>This game hinged in large part on which team would react better to the absence of Ewing in the middle.</p>
        <p>''Small ball has been better for them,'' Pacers forward Jalen Rose said. ''Any time Patrick is not there it puts more pressure on their perimeter guys. Latrell and Allan answered for them with slashes to the basket. We prepared to play both ways -- with Patrick in there or without. I know it didn't look like it.''</p>
        <p>That was because Latrell Sprewell (46 minutes, 32 points) and Allan Houston (45 minutes, 28 points) kept coming hard, breaking down the Indiana defense. Larry Johnson (44 minutes, 14 points) and Charlie Ward (30 minutes, 14 points, 9 assists) did, too. Even with no Ewing, the Knicks led in points in the lane by 50-32.</p>
        <p>''They were more loose and more perimeter oriented,'' Pacers forward Dale Davis said. ''I think they are going to force us as a team to help out and stop their top two scorers. We will make changes.''</p>
        <p>Rik Smits, the Pacers' center, knew that Ewing's foot injury would keep him from playing, so Smits had an edge from the start. He has had success against Ewing, especially offensively, and Smits knew that none of the Knicks' reserves could pester him like Ewing. Indiana's initial idea, therefore, was to feature Smits, and he responded, playing 22 of 24 minutes in the first half and scoring 21 points on 10-of-15 shooting from the floor. He scored 21 of Indiana's first 32 points.</p>
        <p>But as the game wore on, the Pacers went away from Smits for stretches. In the third quarter, Smits played 11 minutes and scored 2 points. When the Pacers tried involving him more, however, he faded and scored only 2 more points, finishing with 25. In the second half, the 7-foot-4-inch Smits even had his shot blocked by the 6-2 Ward. And that is Smits -- sometimes easy to find and at other times out of sight.</p>
        <p>''In the first half, I got looks,'' Smits said. ''They didn't let that happen in the second.''</p>
        <p>And the Pacers did not ensure that Smits remained involved.</p>
        <p>''You know, that's basketball,'' Davis said. ''It's part of the game. People instinctively start looking for their shots and trying to make other things happen.''</p>
        <p>Rose said of Smits's meltdown: ''Fatigue is always a problem, especially when you get going that fast that early and then run around on defense. I would like to see him stay closer to the basket, especially with Patrick and Camby out of the game, be our goaltender.''</p>
        <p>Long rebounds turned into Knicks fast-break points. Indiana turnovers (15) turned into more Knicks chances. And none of the Pacers could fully exploit Ewing's absence.</p>
        <p>The Knicks started with Chris Dudley at center and ended with Kurt Thomas as Ewing's replacement. Thomas was active, pushing and grinding on Smits, creating room for rebound work, hustling up the floor to give the Knicks a fast-break presence. Dudley was a factor, too, denying entry passes to Smits.</p>
        <p>Larry Bird, the Pacers' coach, had an opinion about the Knicks, with and without Ewing: ''I think with Patrick they're a lot better. They get some rebounds, which is one of their weaknesses, and he can score in the low post. He gives us a lot of problems. Without Patrick, they are more of a running team. They like to go up tempo and move the ball around.''</p>
        <p>In other words, the Knicks play a freer brand of basketball without Ewing. Dribbling, running and shooting with less hesitation. Pressuring more on the perimeter on defense.</p>
        <p>It was the Knicks yesterday who better handled Ewing's absence.</p>
        <p>This was the Knicks' 13th playoff game of the season, and they scored their playoff high. Their attitude -- a new way, a freer style, the one they rode to the finals last year -- was back, for at least one playoff game.</p>
        <p>Regardless of Bird's view, the Pacers' players prefer Ewing's return. They know exactly what to expect with Ewing in the lineup. Without him it is clear they do not.</p>
        <p>The Knicks, of course, say their preference is clear.</p>
        <p>''We were just going at guys today,'' Sprewell said. ''I don't know if it's the answer. I'd rather take my chances with Patrick. But if he's not in there, we have to speed up the game and create and make something happen, and that's what we did.''</p>
