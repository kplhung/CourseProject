        <p>IN Westchester, many real estate agents have found success with sometimes quirky methods.</p>
        <p>There's Muffin D'Ambrosio, an agent for Ginnel Realty in Bedford, who shows properties to prospective buyers on horseback on neighborhood bridal paths. She was the listing agent on the sale of the Grace Estate, a 120-acre parcel in Bedford bought by Martha Stewart for $15.7 million.</p>

        <p>IN Westchester, many real estate agents have found success with sometimes quirky methods.</p>
        <p>There's Muffin D'Ambrosio, an agent for Ginnel Realty in Bedford, who shows properties to prospective buyers on horseback on neighborhood bridal paths. She was the listing agent on the sale of the Grace Estate, a 120-acre parcel in Bedford bought by Martha Stewart for $15.7 million.</p>
        <p>There's Mark Seiden, the top selling agent for Coldwell Banker countywide over the past two years. Last year he completed 75 transactions with an aggregate value of more than $25 million.</p>
        <p>Most of his listings can be seen on his Web site, homeman.net, which offers video tours of homes. He sold a woman a house in Briarcliff Manor, he said, after her husband, in Colombia, inspected the home online and gave his approval.</p>
        <p>Susy Glasgall had 51 transactions for $43.6 million in total sales last year. Last month, she smoothed her black leather blazer and skirt and pulled a green Open House sign out of the trunk of her black Lexus and jammed it into the lawn of an angular white house on Deer Run in Rye Brook.</p>
        <p>She set up trays of fresh fruit and finger food and began working the room like a party planner, pointing out the large indoor hot tub, the huge walk-in closets, the free-standing oak staircase with clear Lucite railings.</p>
        <p>Ms. Glasgall is very chatty and friendly with other brokers, but those who know her say that beneath her unruffled calm, she is like a duck, paddling furiously underneath.</p>
        <p>For this house, she said, she set the asking price at $859,000, a bit lower than the realistic figure, to start a bidding war and ultimately get a higher offer.</p>
        <p>Co-workers say Ms. Glasgall gains her clients' trust any way she can, whether it is running to the store to pick up prescriptions for them or getting their children into the right nursery school and sometimes driving them there.</p>
        <p>She once spent weeks talking a client out of suicide, often taking her meals until the sale went through, said Stephanie Thompson, a mortgage broker who works with Ms. Glasgall. Once, during an open house for an absentee seller, the dog slipped out an open door. Fearing that a lost dog might cost her a sale, Ms. Glasgall chased it down a half-mile from the house.</p>
        <p>But not every broker spells success by selling million-dollar homes in southern Westchester. John Petrillo, a real estate agent in Brewster, brokered 85 transactions last year, averaging $270,000 each, for a total of about $23 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Petrillo began as a builder and became a licensed broker to sell properties he developed. He still builds, but in 1996, he began working as a sales agent for Century 21-V.J.F. Realty in Brewster. Last year he was the top producing agent of the 280 Century-21 offices in the metropolitan area.</p>
        <p>On a recent Saturday morning he took a young Manhattan couple to visit the 1.6-acre construction site in a South Putnam area called South East, where their post-modern, 2,700-square-foot house is being built on a hilltop.</p>
        <p>The couple, Bryce Young, a securities and sales trader, and his wife, Ellen, a ballet choreographer who is pregnant with her first child, is moving out of a $1,200-a-month studio in the Murray Hill section of Manhattan.</p>
        <p>To get the Youngs to pay $416,000 for a house in lower Putnam County that exists only on paper, he had to make them visualize the house in an area that was construction-site rubble.</p>
        <p>Mr. Petrillo exudes trust and experience. He is a working man whose children attended the public schools in Brewster. The Youngs' house is being built by two brothers who worked for him as teenagers. He got the mortgage through his daughter Jeanna Petrillo. Oh, and he's moving to a home being built across the street.</p>
        <p>''With a client, it's like a short-term marriage,'' he said. ''It's a personal business. They need atttention. They have needs and wants.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Young said he was comforted by Mr. Petrillo's track record as a builder.</p>
        <p>''He's built hundreds of homes,'' Mr. Young said, adding with a laugh, ''not to mention that if something breaks in the middle of night I'll be knocking on his door.''</p>
