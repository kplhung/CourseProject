        <p>DINO'S isn't just another Italian restaurant. Its soul-stirring food reminds us why Italian eating places reign supreme on Long Island. The creative and traditional and the earthy and refined renditions of dishes that emerge from the diminutive kitchen at this Nesconset newcomer explain the long-running love affair with Italian cuisine.</p>
        <p>Dino's, at 211 Smithtown Boulevard (631-979-7724), is a dream come true, not only for its patrons but for its two owners, who until recently worked for others and now have their own place. P. J. Bruno, who was the head waiter at Tutto Pazzo in Huntington, and Dino Vlacich, who toiled in Cafe Girasole's kitchen in East Norwich, have covered all the bases.</p>

        <p>DINO'S isn't just another Italian restaurant. Its soul-stirring food reminds us why Italian eating places reign supreme on Long Island. The creative and traditional and the earthy and refined renditions of dishes that emerge from the diminutive kitchen at this Nesconset newcomer explain the long-running love affair with Italian cuisine.</p>
        <p>Dino's, at 211 Smithtown Boulevard (631-979-7724), is a dream come true, not only for its patrons but for its two owners, who until recently worked for others and now have their own place. P. J. Bruno, who was the head waiter at Tutto Pazzo in Huntington, and Dino Vlacich, who toiled in Cafe Girasole's kitchen in East Norwich, have covered all the bases.</p>
        <p>Picture-perfect plate presentations, caring and solicitous but never intrusive service and distinctive dishes not found elsewheremake this a very special spot. The neat, small green dining room has alternating mirrors and sconce lights and white tablecloths, and an in-a-wall-wine-rack and another recessed display cabinet containing stemware, carafes and decorative olive oil bottles.</p>
        <p>No sooner are diners seated than an extra-large bread basket appears, piled high with warm focaccia, onion bread and garlic toast, accompanied by roasted garlic cloves for spreading. Water is poured from hand-painted pitchers, and the slender bud vases, with fresh daises and baby's breath, are similarly decorated.</p>
        <p>Despite all these lovely little touches and its fresh, full-flavored food, Dino's isn't expensive. Soups, salads and desserts cost $5, most pastas are in the $10.50 to $11.50 range, six entrees are priced at a modest $14.50 (only one exceeds $19.50) and nightly specials go for no more than regular a la carte main courses. (But the tab for wine is at least $20 a bottle.)</p>
        <p>If this restaurant were in the Hamptons or along Miracle Mile in Manhasset, it would probably be necessary to beat customers back with a stick. I suspect that even in its present unlikely area of pasta and pizza storefronts, on the corner of Lake Avenue, business will be deservedly brisk.</p>
        <p>A major factor is the simplicity of the tasty, understandable fare. Typical is craphi ($6.50), a pasta dumpling popular along the Austrian-Italian border. The chef learned the recipe for this ravioli lookalike from his mother. Four delectable squares are covered with a straightforward butter-sage sauce and stuffed with cheese and blonde raisins to yield an unexpected and wholly delightful sweet-and-sour taste.</p>
        <p>There's nothing very complicated about the vegetables that escort entrees here. But the family-style bowl of mashed spinach, broccoli rape and potatoes certainly beats the dull, boring, unseasoned steamed or boiled vegetables so often encountered.</p>
        <p>Little twists add flair to otherwise ordinary dishes: a pillbox-shaped serving of tiramisu has chunks of cracked chocolate at its core, a graceful curl of sage crowns the boneless Cornish hen ($14.50), the rack of lamb special ($19.50) is perched on a nest of mushrooms, sheets of shaved, almost translucent Parmesan cheese rest atop the Caesar salad and risottos ($14.50). The hefty pasta e fagioli contains not just macaroni noodles but a dazzling diversity of pastas, and the spinach salad is generously laced, not with minuscule bacon bits, but with substantial squares.</p>
        <p>Two simply grilled and seasoned preparations, tender long-stem artichoke hearts ($6.50) and five jumbo shrimp over grilled vegetables ($18.50), were enthusiastically received because their olive oil, salt and pepper sheen enhanced rather than obscured their true tastes. Simplicity and an effort to highlight each dish's primary taste, rather than complex preparations that run in sometimes competing directions, is very much in evidence.</p>
        <p>About three dozen tiny Manila clams ($6.50) rest in a bowl of savory garlic white wine sauce. Two soft squares of polenta ($6.50) are draped with melted fontina cheese (but are not overwhelmed), a cream of mushroom soup special is smooth, not gloppy, despite its enriching celery, onions and pureed potatoes. The wild mushrooms and garlic slivers tucked into the creamy risotto bolster rather than divert from its basic flavor. So too does the dainty plum sauce that blankets the linguine pescatore ($15.50) enable its moist, perfectly cooked scallops, shrimp and clams to be appreciated. (None were yesterday's dried out shellfish.)</p>
        <p>Ditto for the plain, simon-pure white wine lemon sauce that perked up two dishes: a salmon-sea scallop special ($17.50) scattered with tomato cubes and capers, and chicken scarpariello ($14.50), sauteed boneless strips of fork-tender meat festooned with garlic and sprigs of rosemary. That succulent Cornish hen and vitello alla Dino ($16.50) -- a layered veal, eggplant, cheese and tomato affair -- and the done-to-rosy-perfection chops in the rack of lamb are other entrees that deserve more than a nod of recognition.</p>
        <p>Desserts come decorated with chocolate syrup squiggles, cocoa sprinkles, raspberries, blackberries and fruit coulis. We tried an ordinary ricotta cheesecake and a better-than-ordinary pear tart, an apple strudel and a raspberry tart with luxuriant pastry cream, a delicate crust and ripe fruit.</p>
        <p>Openings</p>
        <p>Marra's, a new 62-seat, pasta-pizza-panini storefront, opened on May 1 at One School Street in Glen Cove (516-609-3335). Its chef and owner is Mario Marra, who was the kitchen commander at Dimaggio's in Glen Cove from its opening in 1997 until December of last year. The simple two-story spot, with outdoor dining, offers sit-down and takeout service at economical prices (appetizers $4 to $8, pizzas $5 to $10, pastas $7 to $10 and panini $6 to $8). The restaurant also plans nightly dinner specials.</p>
        <p>Cerulean, 143 Main Street, East Hampton (631-329-5550), is the name of the new restaurant that will operate out of the 1770 House this summer. The 45-seat spot hopes to make its debut this weekend. It will offer a marriage of eclectic flavors with tropical Asian overtones. Appetizers (monkfish foie gras with sweet and sour mango relish mizuna) will range in price from $9 to $19. Entrees (Chilean sea bass on a corn and crab hash with baby spinach and warm citrus vinaigrette) will be between $22 and $39. An extensive wine list is in the works.</p>
        <p>Cerulean is the brainchild of Wendy Wachtel and Alfredo Merat of Overseas Connection Villas, who are bringing Cybele Cuzon, their executive chef, from the Cerulean Villa in the Caribbean.</p>
        <p>Anthony Passafiume has taken over the 110-seat Villa Doria, at 2565 Bellmore Avenue in Bellmore (516-785-5353). The Italian restaurant is under the direction of Joseph Ciminera, the executive chef, who came from the Guggenheim Mansion in Sands Point. He has spent time in the kitchens of Le Cirque, Le Petit Bijou (both in Manhattan), Abbraciamento in Brooklyn and Eatzi's Market and Bakery in Westbury. He is a grauate of the French Culinary School.</p>
        <p>Villa D'Este, a longtime Northern Italian restaurant in Floral Park, has moved to 186 Jericho Turnpike (516-354-1355) with a new menu and decor.</p>
