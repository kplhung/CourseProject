        <p>THIS spring, the one-two punch of ''Walking With Dinosaurs'' and ''Raising the Mammoth'' heightened the visibility of the Discovery Channel. But the public was already watching.</p>
        <p>First broadcast on April 20, the three-hour ''Dinosaurs,'' which applied nonfiction nature-program techniques to prehistory, was the most-watched documentary ever broadcast on cable, according to Discovery executives. With 10.7 million viewers, it broke the record of 10.1 million that had been set only a month before by ''Mammoth.''</p>
        <p>As Disney executives found when their animated film ''Dinosaur'' earned over $38 million on its first weekend, these beasts have a way of boosting the box office. According to Dr. James Powell, the head of Los Angeles County's Natural History Museum Foundation, their appeal, especially to children, may be related to their size.</p>
        <p>''They are fantastic, as in creatures of fantasy -- as though they had been dreamed up by a science-fiction writer,'' he said. ''They weren't. They lived, they breathed, they fought, they bred, they bled, they died.''</p>
        <p>Watching realistic dinosaurs munching on other dinosaurs touches something primal. The minidrama of a 46-foot, five-ton carnivorous female T. rex female howling with desire, then browbeating, coupling with and casting off her smaller lover delivered more raw sex than late-night HBO.</p>
        <p>Ron Simon, a curator at the Museum of Television and Radio, pointed out that ''the primal convention of dog eat dog'' has always been central to wildlife programming.</p>
        <p>And in a dog-eat-dog market, Discovery is now second only to TBS in cable hookups. Celebrating its 15th birthday in June, the Discovery Channel has emerged as a model for profitable educational television, offering an alternative to game shows, formulaic comedies and tabloid TV that succeeds in the marketplace.</p>
        <p>In 15 years, Discovery Communications Inc., based in Bethesda, Md., has evolved into an $11 billion business that owns and operates 20 networks in 150 countries, including the Learning Channel, Animal Planet, Travel Channel and Discovery Health. Its businesses also include the Discovery Network International, retail stores, catalogs and Discovery.com.</p>
        <p>Discovery may not always cater solely to the desire for enlightenment, as the ever-popular Shark Week demonstrates. Now in its 14th year, this weeklong festival devoted to the carnivores doesn't shrink from gore.</p>
        <p>And then there's the ''Christopher Lowell Show,'' the popular (and Emmy-winning) twice-daily decorating program that anchors Discovery's daytime lineup. Recently parodied at length on ''Saturday Night Live,'' the giddy Mr. Lowell, fierce enemy of overlighting and white ceilings, gives tips on how to make such must-haves as a lazy-susan checkerboard.</p>
        <p>But most of Discovery's prime-time slots go to science and nature. Dr. Powell, a geochemist who also oversees the famed fossil deposits of the La Brea Tar Pits, knows firsthand the problems of explaining natural history to the public. On that score, he said he thought ''Walking With Dinosaurs'' was ''extremely well done,'' but added, ''If you're a dinosaur paleontologist, then there's a lot to argue about.''</p>
        <p>What bones might they pick? ''To what extent were dinosaurs warm-blooded or cold-blooded? Were they good parents or not? Most believe that birds evolved from dinosaurs,'' he continued. ''A smaller number dispute that. But when you make a TV program, you have to come down on one side or the other of these issues.''</p>
        <p>One Discovery Channel fan, Dr. Susan Cropper, a New Jersey veterinarian, feels that the channel's programs have value even if scientists can debate one point or another. She sees them as ecological consciousness-raising. ''It's easier to save a thing you love, and it's easier to love it if you know it exists,'' said Dr. Cropper. She also believes Discovery encourages children to consider careers in science.</p>
        <p>Dr. Charles Roper, a Smithsonian zoologist who led the expedition recorded in Discovery's upcoming ''Quest for the Giant Squid'' (airing June 4), agrees.</p>
        <p>Dr. Roper did not watch television as a child and had no inkling that science would enthrall him. ''Had I seen Discovery,'' he says now, ''I would have known at something like 8. Instead, as a junior in college, I finally realized I needed to be a scientist. I would have been absolutely hooked at 8 years of age for sure.'' But Mr. Roper warns junior paleontologists that television shows about science can be deceiving: ''Science is a step-by-step process, and every single day, every single month, doesn't provide new astounding results. But what happens every single day can contribute to astounding results, and I think kids need to realize that. In the television and papers, we hear only of the final result.''</p>
        <p>Shows like ''Quest for the Giant Squid'' and ''Walking With Dinosaurs'' have a long pedigree. Nature programming has always been a television staple. Various incarnations of Marlin Perkins's ''Wild Kingdom'' ran from the earliest days of television through the late 1980's, starting as ''Zoo Parade.'' Johnny Carson had his visits from the San Diego Zoo's Joan Embrey. Jacques Cousteau sailed on ''Omnibus.'' Disney's ''Wonderful World'' featured wildlife specials. PBS had Carl Sagan; the BBC had David Attenborough.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Simon of the Museum of Television and Radio, the 1970's saw a nature-show renaissance. ''It was ripe for a separate channel,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Discovery's founder, chairman and chief executive officer, John S. Hendricks, found himself thinking along those very lines in 1975.</p>
        <p>IN that era of lowest-common-denominator programming, the networks pursued 30 percent audience shares, then only possible with situation comedies; but documentaries could pull 20 percent shares -- not enough to win the nightly ratings race but substantial nonetheless. Mr. Hendricks, who had no formal experience in broadcasting, said he thought, ''If we could create a channel where those people who loved documentaries could call home, we could have something.'' And then Home Box Office began a national satellite-delivered channel. ''That started me thinking: well, gee, there may be potential for having very simple channels that address major categories of TV, such as sports -- and ESPN was born,'' recalled Mr. Hendricks. ''And Ted Turner in 1980 created a news channel, CNN.''</p>
        <p>This was cable's future: segmenting the market to suit individual tastes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hendricks recalled: ''In 1982, I was just obsessed by the idea that a documentary channel would work. If no one was going to do it, then I was going to do it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Simon says Mr. Hendricks's instincts proved accurate. ''The mid-80's were really a time for finding your niche in the cable universe, and Discovery came at the right time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hendricks incorporated in 1982, and, after three years of fund-raising, went on the air in June 1985 with the BBC production ''Iceberg Alley.'' The channel began with 150,000 households; by December of its first year, it was in four million homes. It now reaches 78 million American households and 178 million worldwide.</p>
        <p>In 1988, Discovery began investing in original programs, now its hallmark. Because a single documentary can easily be provided with narrations in many languages, Discovery can generate revenue globally -- and quickly recoup the cost of $1 million documentaries. Infusing the scientific world with cash, Discovery has bankrolled expeditions from the Antarctic to New Zealand.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hendricks said: ''I tell our employees, 'This business could be forever,' because we're appealing to something at the core of human nature: their curiosity and their love of storytelling.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Roper hopes that ''Quest for the Giant Squid'' will whet that curiosity and make the giant squid a dinosaur-sized star -- although the cephalopod hardly seems a match for T. rex. Dr. Roper sees potential, however: ''It's huge,'' he said, ''the largest invertebrate that we know of ever to live on the earth, perhaps up to 60 feet, and perhaps weighing up to a ton. It's related to snails, and slugs, and oysters, for heaven's sakes. Here is one heck of a calamari!'' Dr. Roper uses the giant squid, which has never been seen alive, as ''an icon to get people interested in the deep sea.'' He said: ''There is a parallel in the sense of exploration; outer space is dark and cold, and inner space is certainly dark and cold. Inner space is the least-explored ecosystem on earth, absolutely more so than the rain forests. Folks are traipsing over the rain forests all the time.''</p>
        <p>The fact that Dr. Roper and his ''Quest for the Giant Squid'' do not actually raise a live giant squid does not worry the boss. ''If it was a guaranteed success, it wouldn't be much of an adventure,'' Mr. Hendricks says.</p>
        <p>Discovery capitalizes on that sense of armchair adventure. Even David Letterman gets it. The guest was the sportscaster Marv Albert. Mr. Letterman told him, ''When I'm curious, I turn on the Discovery Channel.''</p>
