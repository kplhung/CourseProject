        <p>IT'S all in the title. ''The Good Person of New Haven'' reflects the best of intentions: To be a good person in a bad world. You can't get much better than that. Talk of what's in a name: New stands for redemptive change, saving grace, hope eternal. And doesn't everyone hope for a safe haven? As for person, the word is human, gender-free.</p>
        <p>What better notion than to adapt time-honored traditions of classical theater to the immediate concerns of a contemporary urban community? And the thrust of arts in education, with an emphasis on diversity, is on the minds of every concerned artist and educator.</p>
        <p>It is no wonder that the Cornerstone Theater Company, based in Los Angeles and traveling everywhere, is applauded for its effort to make the classics fit time and place. And the company is welcomed by communities that need the reinvigoration and enlightenment that theater does best. Think live, interactive, collaborative, participatory, all terms that transcend ego and personal gain. Cornerstone puts such ideals into practice, moving into cities and setting up workshops involving students, elderly people, community leaders, business executives, volunteers of all stripe -- and, for example, resetting Shakespeare to nourish dreams and lift spirits.</p>
        <p>At this time the company and its specialists are exploring New Brunswick, N. J., attempting to design a theater piece for the George Street Playhouse and neighboring Crossroads Theater Company. Such work does not happen in a flash. In August 1998 the much-talked about New Haven Project was born. ''The Good Woman of Szechwan,'' by Bertolt Brecht (1898-1956), was the chosen classic, to be adapted by Alison Corey and directed by Bill Rauch, Cornerstone's founders. Participants in the work were selected from Fair Haven, the Hill, West Hills, Wooster Square and Newhallville.</p>
        <p>A workshop production took place at Long Wharf Theater's Stage II last June. Every theater student knows that a Brechtian ground rule is epic theater and one of Cornerstone's missions is to make possible that impossible dream in the world of corrupt economics, in and out of theater. By casting non-professional actors with Actors Equity performers, ''Good Person'' was put on with a cast of 34, 10 of them professional.</p>
        <p>So far, so good. But the place, however purposeful, of ''Good Person'' in the Long Wharf main stage season's repertory seems dubious. Brecht's plays are rarely performed, not just because of cast size, but because they have seldom been popular or understood (with the obvious exception of ''Three Penny Opera'').</p>
        <p>''Good Woman'' was produced only twice in 50 years in New York, and not since 1970 at Lincoln Center. Both times, the play served more as a display piece for a great actress -- Uta Hagen in 1956, later Colleen Dewhurst -- than as effective theater or political message piece.  Brecht's detractors have referred to his plays as tracts sermonizing worn-out ideas. But the theatrical credo of the playwright cannot be entirely overlooked.</p>
        <p>Conveniently, the New Haven production uses the epic part and reinvents the political and the moral for the purpose of raising the self-esteem of a city and making its people -- consequently, one presumes, all people -- count.</p>
        <p>Musical interludes, a great Brechtian device, are superbly interwoven here in calypso, rock and jazz. So is narrative, in the striking person of Quinn, the can man, first seen pushing a supermarket cart on the New Haven Green. His litany of good will groups (Latino youth, all the AIDS programs, Community Gardens, City Kids) and local lures (the pizza) is terrific bravura stuff, performed by Christopher Liam Moore, the star of this occasion.</p>
        <p>Also true to Brecht, as translated from the German by Ralph Manheim, is Ms. Carey's fitfully arousing attempt to alternate slang and lyric language. But the ideas and techniques are simplistically reiterated.</p>
        <p>The playwright's global view was deliberately set in mythical territory and colored by supernatural forces, in order to stimulate objectivity; theater of alienation is the phrase and it is rarely workable. In New Haven, plot line is otherwise followed, the other worldly in the guise of stereotypical white tourists with very bad taste: a terrific notion.</p>
        <p>But site specificity is antithetical to Brechtian beliefs. And the specifics would not be quite so bad if they weren't so often gratuitous and contrived. One script reference, however, is dead on: a visitor from another planet asks when Yale's next Black Panther rally is going to happen; he wants to be there. That would have made Brecht look away and smile.</p>
        <p>Otherwise, there is no reason why angels cannot descend upon New Jersey, seeking the good person of New Brunswick. The set designer Lynn Jeffries' multipurpose backdrop, an artistically striking overview of the Interstate 95 overpass, is a fine Connecticut detail, though it must be added that David Zinn's costumes for the working class are either appallingly unsuitable or patronizingly appalling.</p>
        <p>The saint (read good person) of New Haven is the golden-hearted prostitute Tyesha. With virtuosic intentions and variable results, Patrice Johnson is double cast as the good person and as her cousin, Taiwo Highwater, a capitalist. Taiwo exploits; Taisha recycles.</p>
        <p>Throughout, the acting is uneven at best, except for the thoroughly excellent Christopher Liam Moore. And throughout, sermonizing and moralizing do not stop. Sample: ''No one has a right to prevent a person from being useful.'' It is all for the possibility of doing good in this worst but changeable of all possible worlds.</p>
        <p>''The Good Person of New Haven,'' Long Wharf Theater, 222 Sargent Drive, New Haven (203-787-4282). Performances through next Sunday.</p>
