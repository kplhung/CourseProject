        <p>IT might have been a clever show, who knows?

        <p>IT might have been a clever show, who knows? What the fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld proposed for the Chanel retrospective that the Metropolitan Museum had planned was to commission artists to make works inspired by Chanel. ''I'm not interested in an exhibit that's just old dresses,'' Mr. Lagerfeld explained.</p>
        <p>That was a tacky remark from a man whose business, supposedly, is good taste, but Mr. Lagerfeld wanted something jazzier and more up-to-the-minute than a straightforward retrospective of Coco Chanel. And how better to reflect contemporaneity, his own contribution to Chanel (mais oui!) as well as the current rapport between the fashion and art worlds than to include living artists? You might recall that last week he auctioned his collection of old masters at Christie's, so clearly this season's mantra is: out with the old, in with the new.</p>
        <p>Why should Mr. Lagerfeld decide what kind of a Chanel exhibition the Met would present? The Met was wondering the same thing. Last week Philippe de Montebello, the museum's director, canceled the show. It had been slated for December, the Costume Institute's big splash. Did I mention that Chanel was the sponsor? Mr. Lagerfeld, having been invited by the Met as Chanel's fashion czar to contribute to the show's organization, obviously presumed he had full droit du seigneur.</p>
        <p>''I need to be able to assure people that what they see on the walls is not inflected by the money we receive to do an exhibition,'' Mr. de Montebello said, ''and if I can't make that assurance, then I'm not doing it.''</p>
        <p>The whole affair would now be moot outside fashion circles except that it raises a few persistent art issues aside from sponsorship, which is a point too obvious to belabor. Suffice it to say that, after ''Sensation,'' a pervasive, uninformed Puritanism has become a much bigger threat to American cultural life than Charles Saatchi.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lagerfeld was not quite like Mr. Saatchi. Neither was he a run-of-the-mill C.E.O. trying to pick what should be in a Rembrandt exhibition that his company paid for. It wasn't particularly encouraging to hear that Jenny Holzer was at the top of Mr. Lagerfeld's list of artists he wanted to commission, but let's leave taste aside for the moment. Let's also sidestep whether Coco Chanel really needed living artists as accessories. A friend of Diaghilev, Cocteau and Picasso, she was integral to the art scene of her day, a maker of myths that transcended fashion, and a straight show about her could hardly be dull.</p>
        <p>But the key issue is that the Met could stand to have a few artists, or at least some artistically inclined outsiders, adding fresh ideas and connecting the place more with living culture. Maybe Mr. Lagerfeld wasn't the right guy, but somebody's got to do it. The National Gallery in London asks artists to organize shows of their favorite pictures and commissions works based on paintings in the collection. Trafalgar Square hasn't blown up. The gallery doesn't even collect modern art; it gets involved with living artists, on a limited scale, because it's a good idea. Likewise, in Vienna, installations of design objects at the M.A.K., the design museum, are by artists (they include Donald Judd, Barbara Bloom and, yes, Ms. Holzer), and the place is wildly popular and admired.</p>
        <p>It is not about popularity, though. It is about the Met's connecting with its audience, which includes living artists. Mr. de Montebello has, of course, heard this tune before, and he stresses that he was open to Mr. Lagerfeld's concept. I imagine it came down in the end to a clash of cultures and more than a little sense of entitlement on Mr. Lagerfeld's part plus queasiness on Mr. de Montebello's, after the Brooklyn fiasco. I believe Mr. de Montebello when he says that he tried. It takes guts to cancel a show and offend a sponsor, more guts, perhaps, than it would have taken to back a project with which the museum would never be wholly comfortable.</p>
        <p>Museums always ask what artists think about artist's retrospectives. It was natural at least to ask Mr. Lagerfeld what he wanted as the head of fashion for Chanel. Why not? If Coco Chanel were alive, the Met would have consulted her. If Rubens were alive, wouldn't you want to know what he would put in a Rubens show?</p>
        <p>The question isn't who has a say. It is who has the ultimate say. The Met's 20th-century department, Mr. de Montebello says, responded to Mr. Lagerfeld's idea with a list of several dozen artists it thought appropriate to a Chanel exhibition. Mr. Lagerfeld, who communicated with the museum mostly through the journalist Ingrid Sischy, supplied a half-dozen or so names, only a couple from the Met's list.</p>
        <p>''It is conceivably a very creative idea for the show,'' Mr. de Montebello said, ''but I got the sense that Karl and Ingrid saw the Met as a boring, stodgy institution and that extended to their view of our 20th-century department, so I don't think they would have ever agreed to relinquish control over the choice of artists.''</p>
        <p>The Met had no choice in that case. Curatorial integrity trumps even creative inspiration. Some curators around town were privately wondering whether it would ever have been possible to have got the artists to make the works and then to have designed and installed the exhibition by December. Time had passed. The death last November of Richard Martin, chief curator of the Costume Institute at the Met and the man who originated the idea for the show, left a gap.</p>
        <p>Maybe if the Met had more people on its staff attuned to contemporary culture, Mr. de Montebello might not have ended up as he did, falling back late in the game on the only honorable plan: retreat. Someday, if the museum hires a good new curator for the institute and invigorates its modern-art department, it may even be in a position to come up with its own novel plan for shows with living artists, rather than responding to someone else's. We're waiting.</p>
