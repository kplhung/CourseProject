        <p>To the Editor: I was dismayed and rather saddened to read your article ''Children, Neither Seen Nor Heard'' (Practical Traveler, April 9).</p>
        <p>I am a coupled gay man who prefers to vacation away from young children. Why would the writer, Betsy Wade, spend a third of her space describing a well-known heterosexual playground such as Club Med? On top of this she writes two paragraphs about Sandals as being ''adult-only (in fact couples-only),'' an environment the proprietor Butch Stewart says is ''to allow people to focus on each other.'' Mr. Stewart's phraseology should read ''to allow heterosexual people to focus on each other.''</p>

        <p>Please, if you want to discuss quiet holidays for adults, be inclusive of all adults.</p>
        <p>NEIL MAKIN  Dayton, Ohio</p>
        <p>John D. Lynch, executive vice president for Sandals, replies: Everyone is welcome at our two Beaches Resorts in Negril, Jamaica, and Providenciales in the Turks and Caicos, regardless of marital/family status or sexual orientation.</p>
        <p>As to the concept of Sandals, which has a heterosexual couples-only policy: Exclusionary policies (e.g., adults only, nudists only, etc.) are not unusual in the vacation business. At Sandals, we cater expressly to the niche market of honeymooners.</p>
