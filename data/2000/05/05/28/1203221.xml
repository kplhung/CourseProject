        <p>The Mets may have lost Rick Reed for a while tonight, but they managed not to lose to the St. Louis Cardinals when Todd Zeile hit a grand slam in the top of the eighth inning to secure a 12-8 victory.</p>
        <p>The Mets loaded the bases in the eighth on two walks and an error by Cardinals third baseman Craig Paquette. Zeile's one-out slam brought the Mets back from an 8-6 deficit and came off the Cardinals' closer, Dave Veres.</p>
        <p>Zeile, who also homered in the first inning, lofted a high fly to left field that bounced off a billboard just a few feet behind the wall. Left fielder Ray Lankford, who had knocked in five runs, simply ran out of room on Zeile's fly, looking up helplessly from the warning track.</p>
        <p>The Mets tacked on two more runs in the ninth, on Mike Piazza's bases-loaded single and Jay Payton's sacrifice fly.</p>
        <p>Dennis Cook, who worked one and a third scoreless innings, was the winner in the game delayed by rain for 36 minutes in the sixth inning.</p>
        <p>Reed was long gone by then. He has not pitched well lately, but he had gone three starts in a row without issuing a walk. So it was surprising to see him walk the leadoff man for the Cardinals tonight, especially after the Mets had scored five runs in the top of the first.</p>
        <p>Reed did not look right, probably because he did not feel right. He strained a muscle on his left side in the first inning, and pitching through the pain did not help. By the time he left the game, Reed had allowed the Cardinals to tie the score.</p>
        <p>Reed strained his left oblique muscle, and Omar Minaya, the Mets' assistant general manager, said Reed might have to go on the disabled list and would miss at least one start.</p>
        <p>The Mets planned to discuss after the game who would replace Reed in the rotation. They have no pitchers at  Class AAA Norfolk who have stood out, Minaya said, but have several options if they leave Pat Mahomes in the bullpen. Among those at Norfolk, Bill Pulsipher is 2-2 with a 6.11 earned run average after a victory tonight, Bobby M. Jones is 4-2, 4.14 and Grant Roberts is 2-3, 3.97.</p>
        <p>Minaya said it was unlikely the Mets would consider promoting Paul Wilson, the former No. 1 overall draft pick who is pitching well but is being brought along slowly after missing last year with elbow surgery. Wilson recently experienced shoulder soreness, but the Mets believe it is minor.</p>
        <p>Reed's injury is his latest setback in a rough month. The Mets won all five of Reed's starts in April, when he had a 2.21 E.R.A. But he has made mistakes high in the strike zone lately, and he has paid for it with a 6.75 E.R.A. in five starts without a victory in May.</p>
        <p>The Mets gave Reed five runs in the first on a run-scoring double by Edgardo Alfonzo (who has a 12-game hitting streak), a three-run homer by Robin Ventura and another homer by Zeile.</p>
        <p>But a two-run double by Lankford highlighted a three-run Cardinal first, and Lankford's two-run homer to center tied the score in the third. Reed finished his three innings having given up seven hits and five runs.</p>
        <p>Rich Rodriguez relieved Reed in the fourth and had another miserable outing.</p>
        <p>The 37-year-old Rodriguez, who was signed to a two-year, $1.5 million free agent contract late in the off-season, has been passed through waivers but remains a Met, and he would seem to have virtually no trade value. He has been scored on in 11 of his 15 outings.</p>
        <p>Rodriguez sometimes has gone a week between appearances, and he believes he is more effective the more he pitches. Last week he requested a meeting with Manager Bobby Valentine about his role. But another week passed before tonight's outing, and it was perhaps his worst yet.</p>
        <p>Trailing by 6-5 after a bases-empty homer by Piazza in the fourth inning, the Cardinals opened the bottom of the inning this way off Rodriguez: walk, single, walk, Mark McGwire coming to bat.</p>
        <p>That was enough for Valentine, who called for Mahomes. He threw a wild pitch that tied the score, then walked McGwire after a pair of two-strike fouls. Lankford followed with a sacrifice fly that put the Cardinals ahead, 7-6.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>In an effort to snap DEREK BELL out of an 0-for-17 skid -- and to insert a dependable bat in a part of the Mets' order that has been hurting them -- Manager BOBBY VALENTINE made Bell his leadoff hitter Saturday. Bell, who last batted leadoff in 1994 as a member of the San Diego Padres, said the move was ''awesome,'' adding that he planned to steal more bases. Bell has the green light in most cases, said Valentine, who may keep Bell at leadoff for more than one game. . . . Valentine has tried JAY PAYTON in a semiregular outfield role, but he is now giving BENNY AGBAYANI more at-bats. Agbayani has started all five games on this road trip, and he had three singles on Saturday. . . . GLENDON RUSCH, who will start on Sunday, is one and a third innings short of qualifying as the major league leader in a dubious category: worst run support. Rusch has received 1.70 runs per nine innings; Cincinnati's STEVE PARRIS, with 2.72 runs, is the lowest among qualifiers. Rusch has allowed only 0.94 walks per nine innings, also good enough to lead the majors if he qualified. . . . As a Kansas City Royal in 1998, Rusch faced the Cardinals' MARK McGWIRE, allowing the 37th of McGwire's 70 home runs, a shot estimated at 472 feet. ''I was trying to get inside on him, but I left it over the middle of the plate and he crushed it into the upper deck,'' Rusch said. . . . With a sell-out crowd of 48,690 on Saturday, the Cardinals became the first team in the majors to reach one million in attendance.</p>
