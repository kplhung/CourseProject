        <p>Of all the houses on Meadowlark Lane, this one is the shabbiest: it is a dingy mustard color with brown shutters; there is a Toyota Camry parked on what used to be the lawn; the backyard fence is sagging; the window shades are drawn.

I ask her if we could talk for a few minutes and if I could have a look around inside. She looks me up and down, making a judgment.

        <p>Of all the houses on Meadowlark Lane, this one is the shabbiest: it is a dingy mustard color with brown shutters; there is a Toyota Camry parked on what used to be the lawn; the backyard fence is sagging; the window shades are drawn. As I walk up the driveway, I am greeted by a cheap gold ''No Soliciting'' sign on the front door, as well as a smaller sign, handwritten in Mandarin, that I cannot read but that, I imagine, says, ''You are not welcome here.''</p>
        <p>I ring the bell. When the door cracks open, I see a vertical slice of a woman's face: young, Asian, attractive. I introduce myself as a journalist and explain that I live in New York now, but that my family lived here in Sunnyvale, Calif., in this very house from 1963, when I was 3, until my father's death in 1990, when I was 30. I ask her if we could talk for a few minutes and if I could have a look around inside. She looks me up and down, making a judgment. ''Well, if you grew up here, this house must mean very much to you,'' she says in halting English. And then she swings the door open.</p>
        <p>Her name is Sara Liang. She is 27, dressed in shorts and a pink T-shirt. She is wearing Dolce &amp; Gabbana glasses with blue-tinted frames and a bracelet of pink plastic Buddha beads. As we stand in the hallway and talk, I learn that she is from Taipei, Taiwan, and that she came to America in 1993 to attend the University of San Francisco, where she studied international business. Now she works in sales at a small company that imports flat-panel display screens. She is giddy and shy, but willing to show me around. I notice a pile of shoes near the door and begin to remove mine, but she says, ''No, no, that's not necessary.'' She seems slightly embarrassed, as if Asian tradition were something she has recently outgrown.</p>
        <p>We move inside, and I have the strange feeling that I am looking at the wreckage of the American dream, circa 1963: the kitchen, which my mother was so proud of and where we gathered every night at 6:30 for our family meal of beef stroganoff or tuna casserole, now looks like the communal kitchen in a freshman dorm. Two fluorescent lights flicker overhead, and the floor is covered with industrial-grade linoleum. A second refrigerator has been shoved up against the wall in the dining area, a torn curtain is falling off its rod above the sliding glass door and the cupboards are empty, save for a large bottle of soy sauce and a few containers of SlimFast. The fireplace my father built in the family room, with its enormous cobblestone hearth, has been painted white and looks as if it hasn't carried a wisp of smoke since the day we moved out.</p>
        <p>''How many people live here?'' I ask.</p>
        <p>''I don't know,'' Sara says. ''Maybe eight, nine. It is impossible to say. People always coming and going.''</p>
        <p>As Sara and I talk, an Asian man in jogging pants and plastic thongs emerges from what was once my family's living room. A wall has now been erected down the center and another door and window installed, and it has been turned into two bedrooms. Behind him, through a half-open door, I see a small TV on a folding metal chair, a single bed and a computer. ''Hello, Eric,'' Sara says. She continues in Mandarin, explaining who I am and why I am in the house. He glances up at me, then turns around, walks into his bedroom and closes the door.</p>
        <p>''Engineers are weird,'' Sara says.</p>
        <p>''Weird in what way?'' I ask.</p>
        <p>''They have no lives,'' she says.</p>
        <p>I ask if I can meet any of her other roommates.</p>
        <p>''No one else is home now. Maybe later.''</p>
        <p>''What time do the others get home from work?''</p>
        <p>''All hours -- usually 9, 10 o'clock,'' she says. Then she adds, with a giggle, ''We all work very hard, because we want to get rich in Silicon Valley.''</p>
        <p>In a place where every molecule is stretched toward the future, nothing feels quite so freakish as looking backward. In Silicon Valley, the very notion of reflecting upon what has happened, rather than what will be, seems to violate the laws of physics. My own sense of disorientation is underscored by the magnitude of the changes that have swept through this once-sleepy flatland at the foot of the San Francisco Bay over the last 20 or so years. When I was growing up, this region -- roughly the area between Palo Alto and San Jose -- always felt like a lonely place, nothing but fruit trees and aerospace engineers. I thought the future was anywhere but here.</p>
        <p>I was not just wrong, but grandly, hilariously wrong. I witnessed the birth of a new world, even if I was too ignorant to recognize it at the time. The valley not only designed and built much of the machinery that powers the new economy but it also freed capitalism from its old restraints of class and corporatism, transforming untold numbers of college dropouts into multimillionaires and sparking a technological revolution that is reshaping our lives in unimaginably vast, complex and subtle ways. So powerful is the valley's allure that the word ''silicon'' itself, as if it wields alchemistic powers, has been snatched up by business leaders everywhere: Silicon Alley in New York City, Silicon Bog in Ireland, Silicon Forest in Seattle, Silicon Prairie in South Dakota. One Web site has counted 90 Silicon Valley wannabes.</p>
        <p>I should be proud of the stature of my hometown, but the truth is that I have mixed feelings. This whirlwind has been great for my retirement fund (even after the recent battering), and I love my computer almost as much as I love my dog. But outrageous prosperity does not come without a cost: most of my friends and family who do not work for high-tech companies have long since fled the area, driven out by skyrocketing real estate prices and snarling traffic. My eyes have burned from the thickening smog, I've tasted the metallic water that flows out of the faucet in my old house and I've seen even my most successful, level-headed friend become consumed by envy because the guy in the cubicle besides him is worth nine million and he is worth only four. I've watched the apricot orchards get bulldozed and the dark, rich alluvial soil -- the finest in the world, ranchers say -- get paved over and forgotten. Twenty years ago, the valley felt like a suburban nowhere, sleepy and homogenous; today, it feels like a giant, nonvirtual eBay, a noisy, chaotic place that is growing at an exponential rate, where everyone is consumed with making the big score.</p>
        <p>Still, many of the changes in the valley are worth celebrating. Good restaurants, for example. Palo Alto, Mountain View and San Jose are exploding with interesting, expressive cooking and a newly civilized clientele. ''Five years ago, you had to explain to people what a salad fork was and that you might want to wear socks when you go out for dinner,'' says David Kinch, the chef and co-owner of Restaurant Sent Sovi in Saratoga, one of the top establishments in the region. ''Today, my clientele is as sophisticated as the clientele at any restaurant in the world.'' Downtown San Jose, long a ghost town, now boasts the new Tech Museum, an elegant Fairmont hotel, a refurbished museum of art and, coming soon, a new city hall designed by Richard Meier. The old concrete tilt-up office buildings that blight the industrial landscape are slowly becoming things of the past; companies like 3Com and Novell have built artful new campuses with outdoor patios, water sculptures and cantilevered roof supports. ''The area is beginning to achieve a distinctive style and sense of itself,'' says Erik Sueberkrop, a principal at Studios Architecture, a firm that has designed many of the area's most stylish buildings, including the 3Com campus. ''You can feel the fabric of a new society being woven together here.''</p>
        <p>The biggest change prosperity has wrought, however, is in the faces of the people who live here. For most of the 20th century, the population of Santa Clara County (which includes the bulk of Silicon Valley) was about 80 percent white. Today, thanks largely to a wave that has brought nearly 160,000 immigrants into the area in the last decade, whites are now a minority. The 1.6 million people who live in the county are 49 percent white, 24 percent Hispanic, 23 percent Asian and 4 percent black. The defining character of Silicon Valley today is not the pasty-faced plaid-shirt-wearing aerospace engineer, but a young geek from Taipei or Bangalore with an H-1B visa and a fondness for American pop culture. These new immigrants are escapees from small villages and moribund economies; they are attracted to the valley by its reputation as a digital meritocracy, where nobody cares what color your skin is as long as you can speak the global language of entrepreneurs. Although most of these new immigrants are highly educated and technologically savvy, they have at least one thing in common with the waves of dreamers who came through Ellis Island a hundred years ago -- they believe America is a land of opportunity, a place where they can build better lives. Some want to put down roots and pledge their allegiance to the flag; others are the 21st-century equivalent of 19th-century gold miners who traveled from strike to strike, looking for the next mother lode.</p>
        <p>A handful of these new dreamers, I recently learned, have taken up residence in my old house in Sunnyvale. I went home to meet them and to see what the digital revolution has done to the place that gave birth to it.</p>
        <p>To thank her for showing me around, I offer to buy Sara dinner. The following night, we head to Cupertino Village, a small shopping center a few blocks from the house. I know the place well; I used to ride my bike here to buy Spider-Man comic books. There was a Rexall drugstore, a Safeway supermarket, a deli that served excellent bratwust, a dry cleaner and a travel agent. The shopping center is across the street from several early Hewlett Packard buildings -- Steve Wozniak worked here in the 1970's while he and a barefoot kid named Steve Jobs were wiring together their first computer in Jobs's garage.</p>
        <p>Today, the shopping center has been transformed into a suburban Chinatown. The parking lot is jammed; the signs are all in Mandarin. A Chinese supermarket called Ranch 99 is stocked with 50-pound bags of jasmine rice and salmon heads for $2.99 a pound. In an herbal medicine shop, dried shark fins hang on the walls, and exotic varieties of ginseng are packaged like precious jewels.</p>
        <p>Sara is dressed in high heels, blue jeans and a Guess denim jacket -- she is bubbly, happy, a little vain, completely charming. As we walk around the shopping center, she tells me that she ended up in my father's house because of an ad in The World Journal, a Taiwanese newspaper published daily in America; when she went to look at the room, she liked it because at $550 it was relatively inexpensive and because it was convenient to the freeway as well as to her office in Santa Clara. ''I only plan to stay a few months, until my parents buy me a house,'' Sara explains. She pauses in front of a Taiwanese antique store and points to a ceramic Buddha that sits serenely in the window, gold paint peeling off her nose. ''This is Chinese antique,'' she says, with thinly veiled disgust. ''This is what my mother likes. The house where I grew up in Taiwan was full of it. That is why I hate it. When I get my own house, it will have none of that in it. I want everything clean and new.''</p>
        <p>Home decor is very much on Sara's mind, it turns out. Her mother and stepfather, who live in Taiwan (her parents divorced when she was 12; her stepfather is a financier who Sara claims ''is not rich but definitely not poor either''), recently decided they want to buy a house in America -- they will use it only a month or two each year when they visit, but mostly it is for Sara. She has been running around with real estate agents for weeks, looking at dozens of houses in the half-million-dollar range. That is about the median price of a house in the valley today, and it gets you, at best, a shaggy but livable three-bedroom tract house in the flatlands.</p>
        <p>Although California is half a world away from Taipei, Sara says her parents feel very comfortable here. ''There are so many Chinese here now, it is almost like home. You can read Taiwanese newspapers, shop in Taiwanese markets, go to Taiwanese restaurants. But you have American stock market, American political system. It is maybe better than home.''</p>
        <p>For Sara's parents, owning a house in the valley is also an escape hatch from the rapidly escalating political tensions between Taiwan and mainland China. ''No one knows what's going to happen in Taiwan,'' Sara explains. ''Our relationship with the mainland is not good, the stock market is not strong -- there is a lot of uncertainty. If China invades, what happens to my parent's property? It could be confiscated; no one knows.''</p>
        <p>Sara, of course, wants a house for her own reasons. For the first time in her life, she is thinking about starting a family. She also sees a home as something that will give her life in America some ballast: her H-1B visa, which allows her to work in the United States for six years, will expire in three years, and unless she has been approved for a green card by then (highly unlikely) or has married a U.S. citizen (distinct possibility, since her current boyfriend was recently granted citizenship), she will have to leave the country for a year, then reapply for another visa, which given the competition, is anything but certain. ''If I own a house, or if my parents own a house, I feel like it is the first step toward -- how do you say? -- putting down roots.''</p>
        <p>As for the house she lives in now -- my house -- she hardly gives it a thought. It's just a place to crash, a way station between her last apartment and her new life. She pays her rent to a Taiwanese immigrant who bought the place as an investment. She rarely sees her roommates, and when she does, they don't talk much or share meals. ''It's not like 'Friends,''' she jokes. The only person she knows at all, she says, is Tammy, the woman who lives in the other half of my father's old bedroom. Tammy is also from Taiwan and works in sales for a cable modem company.</p>
        <p>After dinner, we return to the house and Sara takes me upstairs and knocks on Tammy's bedroom door. Tammy opens it, glances at me, then back at Sara. She is middle-aged, tired-looking. She and Sara converse for a few moments in Mandarin, and Tammy becomes increasingly upset. I wonder if there has been a family tragedy.</p>
        <p>After Tammy closes the door, Sara turns to me. ''She does not want to talk tonight -- she's not in a very good mood,'' she explains. ''Her AOL stock lost five points today.''</p>
        <p>It is a sunny spring day, and my sister, Jill, and I are walking along a levee at Shoreline Park, an open-space preserve near the foot of the bay that is a popular jogging and in-line skating spot for high-tech workers. Jill, 31, is the last member of my family who still lives in the valley. She is a project manager at Excite@Home, a top cable modem service and Internet directory that was once -- and may again be -- one of the hottest companies in the area. Despite the company's sagging stock price, she loves her job and the friends she has made there, as well as the glitzy new campus in Redwood City, where she can step outside her cubicle onto the third-floor breezeway and get a magnificent view of San Francisco Bay and the southern portion of the valley.</p>
        <p>I tell her about the people living in our old house, and how the rooms have been subdivided.</p>
        <p>''How bizarre,'' she says.</p>
        <p>''Bizarre how?''</p>
        <p>She looks over at the new Microsoft campus that has risen nearby. It is gray and black and stealthy-looking -- the architectural equivalent of Darth Vader's mask.</p>
        <p>''I just think Dad would be spinning in his grave right now if he knew about this.''</p>
        <p>She may be right. My father was an Old World man. As a landscape contractor, he worked with plants and trees, not bits and bytes. But he loved Sunnyvale -- the balmy weather, the rich soil, the feelings of hope and optimism that were embodied in the beautifully curving sidewalks and sparkly new kitchen appliances.</p>
        <p>Our house was nothing special. It had hollow wooden doors and cheap aluminum-framed picture windows, but my father adored it anyway. He always had some project going on -- landscaping the backyard, converting the garage into a family room, building brick planters around the front of the house. His pi ce de resistance was the fireplace in our family room. He laid every brick and cobblestone himself, working nights and weekends for months. But when it was done, it was magnificent, with a two-foot-high hearth and a firebox big enough to roast an ox. Over the years, our house became the wonder of the neighborhood, a brick-and-mortar monument to my father's deep feeling for his family and for the world he lived in.</p>
        <p>Then the revolution began, and everything changed. It felt less like a revolution, exactly, than the slow buildup of electrical charge you feel as a thunderstorm approaches. My friend's father, who worked for a data storage company, arrived home one night in a new Buick. Other neighbors took vacations to Tahiti, added second stories to their homes, sent their kids to camp on the East Coast. New tilt-up buildings rose around us. My girlfriend in high school, a chemistry whiz who had already set her sights on a career in engineering, received a summer internship at Varian, then one of the valley's largest electronics firms, that paid more than I earned in an entire year of part-time work for my father.</p>
        <p>In the late 1970's, my father's landscaping business fell on hard times, and he was forced out of the company. Landscaping was on the wrong side of the economic bell curve, and my father had difficulty finding work after that. At about the same time, my mother decided she wanted a divorce. Although she had no college degree and had not held a job in 20 years, she was hired by a new company with a dopey rainbow-colored logo: Apple Computer. She ended up working there for the next eight years as a designer, plotting the intricate layouts of printed circuit boards. Unlike my father, she caught the rising wave of prosperity in the valley, and with stock options and a steadily escalating salary, she did very well for herself. She eventually remarried and began a new life.</p>
        <p>My father tried to start over, to date new women, to begin again, but it didn't work. He seemed shellshocked and unable to understand how things had gone wrong so quickly. He refused to sell our house, even when it became a financial burden for him, even when my sister and my brother and I were long gone, and he was living there alone. The house was the last thing he had to hold on to in a world turned upside down. Eventually he couldn't hold on any longer. He died of lung cancer in 1990 at the age of 53.</p>
        <p>My brother and sister and I sold the house a few months later to a Taiwanese engineer and his pregnant wife for $289,000. (My parents paid $19,950 for it in 1963.) As far as I knew, they were the first nonwhite family to move onto Meadowlark Lane. I was happy to pass the house on to them, thinking that they were about to start a family of their own and that they would find as much hope and happiness in it as we had. Whatever they found, it didn't last long. In 1993, they sold it to a Hong Kong businessman named Zhengfei Ren, who used it primarily as a flophouse for himself and his employees when they visited the area. Last June, Ren sold the house to its current owner, a software engineer and real estate speculator named Nelson Chao, for $450,000.</p>
        <p>Chao, who immigrated to the bay area from Taiwan 26 years ago, bought the house for one reason. ''I think it is excellent investment, even better than the stock market,'' he says. And like any good investor, he set out to maximize his profit, cramming in as many tenants as he could get away with. The house was no longer a family home, a repository of hopes and dreams; it was now a wooden structure whose sole purpose was to keep rain off its occupants heads and to generate cash flow.</p>
        <p>There are two Franks living in the house now. The first Frank I meet, who declines to give his last name, lives in the rear half of what was once our living room. He is 30, tall, thin and wary. We talk for a half-hour or so, during which he manages to tell me very little about his life except that he was born in Beijing, came to America to study computer science at the University of Southern California and now works as a software engineer for Nortel Networks. Like almost everyone else in the house, he is here on an H-1B visa; I get the strong impression that he is afraid that if he says one wrong word, he'll be thrown out of the country. That is not true, of course, but life on a temporary visa is full of anxiety and fear.</p>
        <p>The H-1B visa, which was created in 1990 largely in answer to the high-tech industry's complaints about a shortage of skilled workers in the United States, is the topic of heated debate right now. Many high-tech executives are clamoring for the federal government to raise the ceiling on the number of workers allowed into the country each year, arguing that the booming economy is dependent upon attracting the best and brightest minds from around the world. Responding to these demands, the Senate recently introduced a bill to increase the annual allotment of six-year visas, which had already grown to 115,000 in 1998 from 65,000 in 1990, to 195,000. Labor leaders are vehemently opposed to this increase, arguing that the H-1B is little more than indentured slavery and that while foreign workers are indeed important to the new economy, the whole program needs to be substantially reformed.</p>
        <p>The crux of the problem is that because green-card applications are sponsored by employers -- a company basically has to say, ''We need this person permanently'' -- visa holders are locked into an unbalanced relationship with the corporations that hire them. During the application process, which averages three years in San Jose and often takes much longer, an applicant cannot be promoted or change his or her basic job description. And if an applicant switches companies or is laid off, the whole application process begins all over again.</p>
        <p>For workers from China and India, the H-1B is a particular problem. Although more than half the H-1B's go to citizens of those countries, the law specifies that only 7 percent of employment-based green cards can go to applicants from any one country. So Indian and Chinese applicants often wait several years for an open slot before they can even apply, and by then it is usually too late to get a green card processed before their visas expire. Many immigrant workers believe that although the high-tech industry claims it wants the green-card application process reformed, in fact the corporations are quite happy with the system the way it is because it gives them a fresh crop of young minds to exploit every six years. ''The information revolution is occurring on the backs of these workers,'' says Pradeep Chaphalkar, a green-card holder from India who is a spokesperson for the Immigrants Support Network, an organization of workers seeking permanent residency.</p>
        <p>When I ask Frank if he feels exploited, he pauses and looks out at the backyard, where the trunk of the mulberry sapling my father and I planted 35 years ago is now as thick as my waist. ''I am very grateful to be in this country,'' he says, then politely excuses himself before I can ask him any more questions.</p>
        <p>The second Frank, I soon learn, lives in my old bedroom. ''He is never home, he works very hard,'' Sara says, then adds with a touch of awe, ''He's a venture capitalist.''</p>
        <p>I meet him a few nights later, when a well-dressed young Asian man blows in through the front door. He is in a hurry and seems to be talking to himself -- then I realize that he is wearing an earpiece connected to a cell phone in his shirt pocket. He is doing business as he walks.</p>
        <p>Sara waves him over. Frank Lin says goodbye to the person on the phone, pulls the wire out of his ear and shakes my hand. He is 25, immediately likable, though a little slick. Unlike the others in the house, his English is impeccable, his manner casual and hip -- he is what's known in the Chinese immigrant community as a ''banana'': yellow on the outside, white on the inside. He was born in Taiwan and came to L.A. with his family when he was 10. They were not struggling immigrants. ''My father ran a large car dealership in Taiwan, and he got into the same business in L.A. and did pretty well,'' Frank says, standing in the sparsely furnished living room, where copies of Business 2.0 and Red Herring are stacked neatly on the coffee table. He graduated from Harvard with a degree in applied mathematics and was immediately hired by Salomon Smith Barney. He worked in the technology division, putting together mergers and acquisitions for Fortune 500 companies like Hewlett Packard. He eventually tired of the grueling hours and rigid corporate structure; when he got an offer from Panasonic's venture-capital group in Silicon Valley, he jumped at it. ''It was pretty clear to me that there are a lot more opportunities here in the valley than there are back East,'' Frank explains. He invites me to visit him at work, and a few days later I take him up on it.</p>
        <p>The Panasonic Digital Concepts Center (P.D.C.C.), which is only a few blocks from my old house, is an example of the latest trend in venture-capital investing in Silicon Valley -- a start-up incubator. It is a little like a day care center for entrepreneurs: Panasonic provides not only start-up capital to its clients but also office space and in-house expertise on how to get a business up and running quickly. The setup gives entrepreneurs space to work, an increasingly rare commodity in the valley, while allowing Panasonic to keep a watchful eye on its offspring. Panasonic's incubator is not the richest -- P.D.C.C. has a modest $50 million fund, which it has used to invest in about a dozen companies so far -- but it may have the sleekest offices: a thin-panel TV playing ''The Matrix'' in the lobby, glass-wall offices, a well-stocked kitchen where geeks working on the various start-ups congregate and swap stock tips.</p>
        <p>Frank's first meeting the morning of my visit is with Joe Corrigan, the C.E.O. of Rocket8, an online auction network targeted at teenagers. Corrigan is here at the P.D.C.C. to pitch the coming global dominance of his company. Depending on how things go over the next hour or so, Corrigan could walk out with a promise of several million for his start-up. Or not.</p>
        <p>The meeting is held around a long mahogany table in one of the conference rooms. Besides Frank at the table are Cate Cavanaugh and Jim Robbins, the company's principals. Corrigan, 25, is a polished, well-spoken guy, his shirt collar open, his sleeves rolled up, suggestive of a man who is getting down to business. He rattles off numbers, flashes charts and talks about ''data mining'' and ''scalability.'' Frank scratches notes on a yellow legal pad and asks a few pointed questions. Cavanaugh and Robbins do the heavy lifting, grilling Corrigan on his business plan: ''How are you going to separate yourself from the hundreds of other sites that are trying to attract the Gen-Y crowd?''; ''I don't really see the nuts and bolts of your revenue stream here -- is this 100 percent advertising driven?''; ''What's going to prevent this from becoming a dumping ground for second-rate products?'' Corrigan has an answer for everything, but it is clear that no one in the room is bowled over by his pitch.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Frank lingers in the hall and talks with me about the flaws and the strengths in Rocket8's business model. ''Maybe we'll take a look at them again in a year or so, after they've built up some momentum,'' he says. This is V.C.-speak for ''Thanks, but no thanks.''</p>
        <p>Still, after this meeting I understand why Sara is so respectful of him. While she is stuck on the phone 10 hours a day, selling computer monitors and worrying about her H-1B visa, Frank works in the valley's inner sanctum -- the place where the money is distributed. Whereas Sara's best hope in the valley is to marry well, Frank has his get-rich-quick credentials in order: a degree from an Ivy League college, an understanding of how money moves, a singular and ruthless devotion to work that is uncluttered by love or lust. He is one of the foot soldiers in what the Silicon Valley social critic Paulina Borsook, author of ''Cyberselfish,'' calls ''the invasion of the M.B.A.'s'' -- the huge flood of well-educated, soft-shoed money shufflers who are a sure sign of what a global powerhouse the valley has become, as well a tombstone for the wild, freewheeling days of barefoot entrepreneurs and change-the-world technohippies. Like the elegant restaurants and sophisticated architecture, the invasion of the M.B.A.'s is a sign that the valley has been civilized.</p>
        <p>To Frank, however, the move from Wall Street to Silicon Valley feels plenty adventurous. Most established V.C.'s get a piece of equity in companies they invest in, and if you hit it big, you can get very rich; Frank, who is near the bottom of the V.C. totem pole, works for straight salary. He won't say how much, except that it is about half of what he was making on Wall Street. Worse, he is living in a place he clearly believes is beneath him. Like Sara, he ended up in my old house by answering an ad in The World Journal. He thinks of it as temporary quarters until he finds a place of his own. But in the few months since he moved in, the landlord has jammed several other tenants into the house, and now Frank has to wait in line for the bathroom every morning and do his laundry in the washing machine in the backyard.</p>
        <p>''I'm paying my dues,'' Frank says one night, looking around my old living room with disdain.</p>
        <p>One night, Sara invites me upstairs to look at some pictures with her. The room is in such chaos that it is hardly recognizable as the room where I watched my father waste away: a double bed on a metal frame against the wall, clothes and junk piled out on the balcony, a folding metal table in the corner that is stacked high with various cosmetics and ointments, a desktop computer with brightly colored fish swimming across the screen and on the nightstand beside the bed, a big plastic pink and white cat-shaped Hello Kitty alarm clock and a dogeared copy of ''Soros on Soros,'' a book-length interview with the global financier George Soros, translated into Mandarin.</p>
        <p>She shows me pictures of herself when she was 21, 22, 23, wearing a red silk dress, on vacation with her ex-boyfriend (now a Microsoft paper millionaire), frolicking on the beach. ''See, I was a good-looking woman once!'' she jokes.</p>
        <p>For Sara, being a single woman in the valley is not fun. She broke up with the Microsoft guy about a year ago, and now she is going out with a software engineer who works at an investment bank in San Francisco, but she is not sure where that relationship is going. In the valley, where men outnumber women by roughly 3 to 1, you would think that someone like Sara -- attractive, fun-loving, funny -- would have her pick of the litter. Sara assures me it is not true. ''What is that joke I heard?'' she says, tapping her fingers on the photo album. ''Something about how there are thousands of men in Silicon Valley, but they are all the same man. All engineers. All working very hard. All when they don't work, they have to study, because they are all afraid of becoming obsolete. That is the big fear of everyone here -- if you don't work hard enough, you become obsolete.''</p>
        <p>As it turns out, Sara has a lot of theories about men in Silicon Valley. She believes that the same character traits that this economy rewards -- a monomaniacal devotion to work, technological savvy, a brash arrogance that you, too, can reorder the world -- are precisely the qualities that make most men in the valley such bad bets for husbands. ''It is very difficult to have an argument with a Silicon Valley man,'' Sara explains. ''They are not used to compromising, or not getting their way, or listening.'' She tells me about an engineer she dated who used to yell at her if she got up from her table at a restaurant and pushed her chair back at an angle. ''Engineers like order,'' she says. ''They do not like messy people like me.''</p>
        <p>Part of Sara's worry about men comes from her mother in Taiwan, who fears that she will turn into an old maid. Her parents don't like a lot of what America has done to Sara -- they think she dresses too casually now, doesn't wear enough makeup, speaks her mind too much. At the same time, by American standards she is very conservative. She won't go to bars or clubs, doesn't date anyone who isn't Taiwanese, never does drugs and rarely drinks alcohol. ''I am not American; I am not Taiwanese,'' she says. ''I'm in between, and that is a hard place to be.''</p>
        <p>At 8:30 on a Friday night, Frank Lin picks me up at my hotel in his dusty, gum-wrapper-strewn Honda Accord. He had intended to go to his usual Friday networking party for Asian-Americans at a bar in Palo Alto, but at the last minute he changed his mind -- even Frank, dedicated networker that he is, gets tired of passing business cards around. So, instead, we head up the Bayshore Freeway to dinner with a few of his friends at a sushi restaurant in Milbrae. Bayshore is the Main Street of Silicon Valley, a shaggy, bumpy, traffic-choked four-lane highway that is festooned with billboards for dot-coms desperate to capture a nanosecond of the fractured attention span of the valley's movers and shakers.</p>
        <p>It has been a tense day in the valley -- the Nasdaq fell 189 points, one of the first tremors before mid-April's full-scale panic. Already, the mood is shifting. Gone is the simple idea that anyone who has a good idea and is willing to work hard can hit it big. A quiet panic is beginning to rise, like the panic that spreads on a listing ship when its passengers realize there aren't enough lifeboats to go around.</p>
        <p>Frank, however, shows no signs of slowing down. He snatches up his ever-buzzing cell phone (''Frank Lin,'' he answers with studied abruptness), and it is clear that he is still a little jazzed from a busy day -- four pitches, two of which he says were interesting enough to pursue further. Plus, P.D.C.C. is set to announce a $5 million investment in a company that creates in-store media displays, which is the incubator's largest deal yet. I ask if the day's drop in the markets spooked him.</p>
        <p>''Nah,'' he says with surprising bluster. ''If you're gonna be in this game, you gotta have a stomach for risk.''</p>
        <p>At the sushi restaurant, we meet Frank's friends in a small private room. They are all Chinese and Taiwanese-Americans, and like Frank, they have all been in the United States long enough to become naturalized citizens, they all speak fluent English and of course they all work in high tech.</p>
        <p>The talk is about stocks -- what you should sell, what you should hold, the difference between options and futures, the dangers of shorting and going long. Frank claims to be a long-term investor, not interested in the day-to-day gyrations, but in the valley, that is like standing in the rain without an umbrella and trying not to get wet. One of Frank's friends, Victor Yang, a tall, stylish 25-year-old who sells computer hardware -- L.C.D. screens, motherboards and other components -- for Quanta, a giant Taiwanese manufacturer, admits that these wild market swings are spooky: ''If this thing crashes, where are all these jobs going to go? What are people going to do? Everyone is stretched so thin around here. I think it could be real chaos.'' Like many other salaried workers I've spoken to, Victor admits he is tired of meeting people who have gotten rich simply because they have been in the right place at the right time, and says he won't mind the social justice that a crash would bring to the valley. ''I think a crash would be a kind of leveler,'' he says. ''It might equal things out a bit.'' Of course, Victor's credibility as a have-not is undermined slightly when we leave the restaurant and I notice he is driving a shiny Porsche 911.</p>
        <p>We head down to Nola's, a popular bar in downtown Palo Alto. The place is jammed, music blasting, funky Caribbean art all over the walls. Between beers, Frank talks about his future plans: stay at P.D.C.C. for a year or two, learn how the game is played, then start his own company. What that company might be, he has no idea. ''I think it's important to take your time, think it through. I don't care what the market is doing -- there will always be plenty of money around for good ideas.''</p>
        <p>Frank's relentless optimism is countered by Victor's continuing tales of woe in the hardware business. He spends two or three weeks of every month in the air, he explains, jumping from city to city in the U.S. to visit customers, then flying over to Taiwan at least once every two months to visit the home office. ''My life is a series of airports, hotels and rent-a-cars,'' Victor says. ''It can be brutal. Hardware is a commodity now, like toilet paper, and competition is intense.'' Sipping on his beer, he tells a story about a guy he recently met on a flight from New York to San Jose: ''The guy asked me what I do for a living, and I went on my usual spiel about chips and motherboards and how tough life is in the hardware business. He nodded, then looked at me and said: 'What about the trees, what about the air? Do you ever think about that?' I just stared at him. I had no idea what to say. I just thought: 'You're right, buddy. We've totally lost perspective.'''</p>
        <p>Whenever I am in the valley, I spend a lot of time driving around, checking out new buildings and old haunts, trying to absorb all the changes that have swept through in the last couple of decades. It is not easy. The valley lies between two major earthquake faults, the Hayward and the San Andreas. The ground is, quite literally, always moving. Subtle sociological shifts that take generations to occur in other regions seem to happen here overnight. Barber shops morph into copy centers; malls are torn down and rebuilt; new office buildings rise like towers of Lego blocks; roads are widened, then clogged, then widened, then clogged again. Some of this motion feels appropriate; some of it feels tragic; some seems unwittingly symbolic. The office building where Steve Jobs and his band of merry pirates built the first Macintosh, for example, has been leveled and replaced by sleek new offices for Ernst &amp; Young, one of the world's largest accounting and consulting firms. Even more telling, the bungalow where the Nobel Prize-winning scientist William Shockley designed the first transistor chip in the late 1940's -- a Silicon Valley landmark if ever there was one -- now sells ergonomic furniture, designed to relieve the stress of high-tech life.</p>
        <p>There are signs that the brutality of life here is beginning to take its toll. Austin, Tex., not Silicon Valley, was the fastest growing high-tech center in the United States in 1999; in fact, last year, for the first time in five years, the tide of new immigrants into the valley was offset by an even stronger flow of people moving out. And no wonder. The quality of life in the area has seriously deteriorated over the last decade. Cities are having a hard time hiring cops; traffic is a nightmare; schools are struggling to recruit teachers -- if you don't work in high tech, why live here?</p>
        <p>Still, Silicon Valley remains the capital of the new world, and as long as it doesn't all vanish in a major earthquake, it will probably retain its prominence for some time. The central paradox of the valley is that although it invented the technology that has made geography increasingly irrelevant, if you work in high tech, this is still the place to be. Part of it is the easy access to vast amounts of capital, which is crucial to anyone dreaming of a start-up; part of it is simply keeping up with the buzz. ''The more dependent we become on technology, the more we understand that it's in face-to-face human contact that all the subtle energies are exchanged,'' says Paul Saffo, founder of the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park. ''In the valley, you pick up information about what's new and what's hot almost by osmosis.''</p>
        <p>So far, Silicon Valley has been able to avoid the ethnic and racial tensions that plague other regions that have absorbed large numbers of immigrants. But easy harmony during boom times is no great accomplishment; it remains to be seen what happens as the boom fades. The valley's true human fault line, however, is not race but class: it is evolving rapidly into a two-tier culture of the technologically savvy global elite and the people who service them. In San Francisco, where many artists and small businesses have been displaced by skyrocketing rents, there is already a backlash brewing. The invasion of the dot-commer was an issue in last November's mayoral race, and warehouse walls in the red-hot South of Market district are scrawled with graffiti like ''evicted.com'' and ''greed.net.''</p>
        <p>But whether these voices of protest are a sign of a rising social movement or just the whispers of the vanquished remains to be seen. One of the self-perpetuating virtues of a fast-changing culture like the valley is that there are fewer and fewer people around who remember what was lost. The past is not only uninteresting; it has been obliterated. The price of progress is memory.</p>
        <p>Sara calls me on my cell phone and says excitedly: ''I found a house! We're closing on it today!''</p>
        <p>A few hours later, we drive to a neighborhood in west San Jose, a couple of miles away from my old house. It is a modest area, maybe one click down the socioeconomic scale from my neighborhood in Sunnyvale. But the house she is buying is neat and pretty, the nicest one on the street, with a big rose hedge and a lemon tree in the front yard. It is hard to see it clearly because it is pouring rain, but that doesn't dampen Sara's enthusiasm. She stares at it through the beating windshield wipers and for moment all her worries -- her boyfriend, her visa, her future -- seem to vanish. She is excited, happy, bouncing in her seat. ''I was born to be an American,'' she crows.</p>
        <p>When we return to my old house, it looks shaggier than ever. The gutters are clogged, and sheets of water are pouring off the roof onto the exterior walls, dripping over the door stoop, seeping through cracks in the shingles. I smell mold, decay, decline. Even the water in the aquifer 210 feet beneath the house is in bad shape, polluted by toxic chemicals -- TCA, TCE, Freon -- that leached into the ground from an old chip-manufacturing plant nearby. My family home is now perched on the edge of a Superfund site.</p>
        <p>Still, life continues on Meadowlark Lane. Sara and I talk in the living room for a while; tonight, for the first time since I've been back to visit, the house is bustling. Eric, the cranky engineer I met on my first visit, heats a bowl of soup in the microwave; the other Frank, the one who works at Nortel, sits with his door a crack open, which, given the closed-up nature of life in the house, is a gesture of friendliness. The hum of activity feels not unlike it did when I was growing up there, and for a moment I wonder if maybe my sister is wrong -- my father is not spinning in his grave. Maybe he is looking up at these new settlers who have landed in his beloved home and smiling, grateful that it is being lived in by people who, in their own way, are as optimistic and hopeful as he once was.</p>
        <p>As I'm preparing to leave, Frank Lin walks in, looking haggard. We talk for a few minutes about the new deals he has been working on and he seems, as usual, excited about them. He tells me that he will be moving out in a few weeks -- his brother is buying a town house and Frank is going to rent one of the bedrooms. ''I can't wait to get out of here,'' he says, glancing around the lonely kitchen. A wave of revulsion passes over his face. ''This place is just such a dump,'' he says. ''There's not much you can do but tear it down.'' Then he heads into my old bedroom for some much needed sleep.</p>
