        <p>BECAUSE it is so contentious, the debate over reforming Social Security draws plenty of attention. So it is easy to overlook that Congress has just reformed Social Security -- enacting a change that should have been contentious but somehow wasn't.</p>
        <p>For the first time, workers in their late 60's have the choice of collecting a full pension regardless of what they earn. That can backfire. What America's senior citizens decide to do with this choice will affect their level of income -- or poverty -- in deep old age. Because of the way the new law plays to human nature, many might make the wrong choice, taking too much pension now and not enough later. Some already  have.</p>
        <p>''Waiting to collect benefits is basically betting that you will live beyond the average life expectancy,'' said Peter Orszag, an economist and Social Security expert at the University of California at Berkeley. That average for people who are already 65 is 81 for men and 84 for women, and rising for both. ''When you give people in their late 60's the choice of collecting their Social Security benefits now, then you raise the odds of their being poor in real old age.''</p>
        <p>The mechanics are simple enough. Previously, people between 65 and 70 who earned more than $17,000 a year had their Social Security pension benefits reduced, and those who earned $52,000 a year or more had them postponed entirely, until they turned 70. As a quid pro quo, the monthly pension checks they ultimately received were higher.</p>
        <p>Now people in their late 60's can earn any amount and still draw full pensions. But the old quid pro quo survives: people can still voluntarily wait until 70 to get larger checks thereafter. Those who take their pensions at 65 get a head start in total benefits paid, but those who wait will overtake them in their 80's, and the longer they live, the wider the gap will grow.</p>
        <p>The monthly payment at 70, for example, would be $1,300 for someone who passed up $1,000 at 65.</p>
        <p>Congress had been moving gradually in this direction, but the new legislation, signed by President Clinton April 7, completed the process in one leap. As a byproduct in this election year, the Social Security Administration expects to deliver $6 billion in extra pension money.</p>
        <p>But that is politics. The real issues are work incentives and adequate income in very old age, particularly the latter. It is still possible to postpone collecting pension benefits until age 70, but hardly anyone has chosen to do so. Of 419,000 registered wage earners in their late 60's who were collecting either reduced benefits or none at all when the new law took effect, only 800 are still holding off until age 70.</p>
        <p>WHAT does not mean the others have all actively chosen not to wait; many were probably swept passively onto the benefit rolls. To minimize its clerical work, the Social Security Administration sent out letters announcing that all 419,000 would receive full benefits automatically, unless they called a toll-free number and specifically opted to wait. Getting through on the often-busy phone line was not easy.</p>
        <p>People who wanted to wait could also have sent back their first checks. But in defiance of a main tenet of mainstream economics, that people make rational decisions in their best interest, hardly anyone returned the checks. ''People in their 60's in good health whose parents lived long lives should rationally choose to defer,'' said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. ''But there is a tendency to want your money now.'' Particularly when it is in hand and substantial; the first checks averaged $3,500, retroactively covering the first four months of the year.</p>
        <p>There is a second irrational tendency among people drawing both paychecks and benefit checks: to spend the pension rather than save for future retirement, increasing the odds of poverty later. But Congress gave in to an irrational outcry from working people in their late 60's who complained with growing frequency that withholding benefits was an unjust ''tax'' on work.</p>
        <p>''There is a real misperception out there that when the money is withheld it is gone; they will never see it again,'' said Kenneth S. Apfel, commissioner of Social Security. ''The number of seniors who perceive this is not insignificant.''</p>
        <p>So Congress acted. Federal surpluses helped to make the action politically palatable. So did another misperception: that in a robust economy suffering labor shortages, removing the earnings limits would encourage senior citizens to work a lot more. The most optimistic studies fail to support this contention. Hours worked will rise 5 percent at most, or roughly the equivalent of 50,000 full-time workers a year. That is what today's strong economy absorbs in a week.</p>
        <p>Maybe there is a lesson here for judging the Gore and Bush proposals for Social Security reform: Look for the misperceptions.</p>
