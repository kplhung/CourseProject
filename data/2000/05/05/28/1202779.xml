        <p>IN old movies and some rose-tinted memories, rail travel in Britain is an idyll of charm and predictability. Puffing Billy steam trains chuff their way through bucolic villages. Salt-of-the-earth families head with noisy cheer for outings in third class. And, in first, silent toffs take shelter behind copies of The Times to ignore one another.</p>
        <p>These days, rail travel in Britain boasts little charm and a lot of unpredictability. The onetime gentility of first class has been replaced by the competing cacophonies of cell phones ringing and conversations that begin with sentences like: ''I can't hear you. We're in a tunnel.''</p>
        <p>In standard -- as the lower class is now  called -- and sometimes in first, rail travel is no more than a scrimmage to find a seat, or face a journey standing. Arrival times are hit or miss; trains sometimes do not move at all for lengthy periods.</p>
        <p>But perhaps the most baffling aspect of British rail travel is the price. Since the old British Rail was privatized in 1996, an inefficient, unprofitable state monopoly has been replaced by inefficient but generally profitable private operators that preclude competition by maintaining regional monopolies.</p>
        <p>Fare structures have become a tangle of elusive discounts and incentives for early booking that have widened the gap between standard and first class passengers -- but probably united them in complaining about  poor service. Last month, for instance, hundreds of people on a train from London to Manchester became so incensed when it broke down -- twice -- that they refused to leave the stricken carriages to board other, equally crowded trains on the same route. Instead, they staged a sit-in until their train was towed into Manchester three hours late.</p>
        <p>Such is the public outcry that one British newspaper, The Sunday Independent, has launched a campaign to protest what it calls the sense that ''We the consumers often seem to have less and less power and less and less choice.''</p>
        <p>For their parts, the rail companies, which still receive some state subsidies in addition to large profits, insist that the railways were in such bad shape under British Rail that years of investment will be needed to lift them to a better standard. But that doesn't explain the complexities of ticket prices.</p>
        <p>Take, for instance, one of the busiest routes between London and Manchester, operated exclusively by Virgin Trains, a part of Richard Branson's Virgin Group, which made its mark with cheap trans-Atlantic flights. Here a traveler may pay anything from $32 (at $1.60 to the pound) round trip for a standard-class ticket booked seven days in advance, to a staggering $345 for the top first-class ticket, which actually exceeds some of Virgin's round-trip fares between London and New York.</p>
        <p>That's not the only complication. A discounted first-class ticket for off-peak travel on this route can cost $96. And, on weekends, people with ordinary standard-class tickets may upgrade to first for a modest $8. Yet a flexible, standard-class ticket without restrictions on when it may be used is $240.</p>
        <p>Rail groups offer five different special travel cards (not counting the Britrail Flexipass discount cards that afford Americans and other foreigners unlimited travel on the entire system within a designated time frame). Thus, anyone under the age of 26, or a full-time student, may pay $28.80 a  year for a Young Person's Railcard, offering a 34 percent discount on trains outside  peak commuting times. There's a similar card for the over-60's. But, unlike in Germany and other European countries, there's no such program for the 26-through-60-year-old business traveler.</p>
        <p>Cross-Channel Eurostar trains and London's Underground are not integrated into most of the above arrangements and require separate booking.</p>
        <p>Technology offers a way through these thickets of confusion, provided the traveler knows what to ask for and has Internet access.</p>
        <p>An American, for example, may contact Britrail on www.britrail.com to buy a Flexipass discount card before leaving the United States for a British vacation. The cards are available only outside Britain and may be purchased from the Britrail Web site, from travel agents or at (888) 422-2748 or (877) 677-1066. Unlike the Classic Railpass, which is good for consecutive days of travel, the Flexipass affords passengers the chance to choose 4, 8 or 15 days of travel within a two-month period. Prices range from a four-day standard-class pass for $235 to a 15-day first-class pass for $770.</p>
        <p>Britrail also offers a variety of links to other free sites, such as www.railtrack .co.uk for British timetable information, and www.raileurope.co.uk for Eurostar services to the continent. Additionally, Virgin's Trainline (www.thetrainline.com) offers a relatively simple system of planning journeys and purchasing tickets online.</p>
        <p>Of course, not everyone travels with a laptop to make those connections on the road. Britain's National Rail telephone service, (44-345) 484950, is a useful source of information. The caller speaks to a real person, but the real person does not always offer full discount fare details unless asked specifically for the best bargains.</p>
        <p>For travel in London -- with its bewildering mix of commuter train, underground and bus services -- an equally useful service is London Travel Information, (44-171) 222 1234, which offers solutions to arcane questions such as: which is the best way to get from Kentish Town to Wimbledon, say, or Shooter's Hill to Notting Hill?</p>
        <p>However you travel, though, don't expect it to be cheap, and the only real toffs you're likely to see will be those you glimpse in chauffeured cars who abandoned the indignities of the railroads a long time ago.</p>
