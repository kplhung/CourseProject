      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The country singer Martina McBride, appearing June 1 at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, always seemed too hip for Nashville. Her 1995 breakthrough single, ''Independence Day,'' became the seed for an impressive repertory dealing with strong, self-reliant women.</p>
        <p>She has recently seen Shania Twain and Faith Hill co-opt her pop-country style to find the crossover success for which she seemed initially destined. But as she often does in her songs, Ms. McBride, 33, got sweet revenge -- winning this year's prestigious Country Music Association's Best Female Vocalist award.</p>

        <p>The country singer Martina McBride, appearing June 1 at the PNC Bank Arts Center in Holmdel, always seemed too hip for Nashville. Her 1995 breakthrough single, ''Independence Day,'' became the seed for an impressive repertory dealing with strong, self-reliant women.</p>
        <p>She has recently seen Shania Twain and Faith Hill co-opt her pop-country style to find the crossover success for which she seemed initially destined. But as she often does in her songs, Ms. McBride, 33, got sweet revenge -- winning this year's prestigious Country Music Association's Best Female Vocalist award.</p>
        <p>Now touring to support her fifth album, ''Emotions,'' Ms. McBride (who used to sell T-shirts for Garth Brooks), sticks to self-empowerment themes. But all is not strident, even in her new ''Love Is a House,'' a half-spoken, half-sung indictment of social ills. She will perform at 8 p.m. Information: (732) 335-0400.</p>
