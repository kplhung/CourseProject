        <p>JUDITH KRANTZ may live in Bel Air, but she's a New York girl by birth and by temperament.</p>
        <p>When she still lived in Manhattan, in 1962, she despaired of being able to glimpse John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, in a Fifth Avenue parade being held in his honor. So, she went to Saks, secured a corner dressing room with windows in the maternity department, and bought a king's ransom worth of clothes she didn't need in order to eyeball her idol. But when she returned her enormous purchase a few days later, Saks balked and canceled her account.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't possibly do without a Saks charge,'' she said last week, back at Saks, whipping through racks of Yves Saint Laurent. ''I wrote them and told them I had a miscarriage.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Krantz, 72, recalls the fib in her new memoir, ''Sex and Shopping: The Confessions of a Nice Jewish Girl'' (St. Martin's). She writes: ''Another step toward fiction? What's a short girl to do?''</p>
        <p>This short girl -- 5 feet 2 1/2 inches, she says -- has done just fine. (Yes, her credit was reinstated.) Although she waited until her two sons were grown before publishing her first novel, at 50, the best-selling ''Scruples,'' she has published nine more best sellers in the last 22 years, most of which I've read. They are my vacation indulgence, what I really read when I've righteously packed Thackeray. Her books transcend the Hollywood gloss of a Jackie Collins, the smarmy heat of a Danielle Steel. Rather, this Wellesley graduate does diligent homework on all aspects of the fashion business, and often the art, antiques and jewelry trades, spinning intricate plots jammed with industry details, which also offer inside looks at worlds of high-octane glamour. Though I've traditionally savored her books poolside, as pure escapism in today's runaway economy they've taken on a practical dimension: a woman's guide to rubies and Renoir.</p>
        <p>If Ms. Krantz's books celebrating Porthault sheets and the women who love them seem oddly in style right now, their timeless appeal lies in their compelling Cinderella stories. A Judith Krantz heroine is beautiful (of course) but also smart, smart, smart. She learns a business along with the reader as she works night and day, overcomes emotional hardships (which only add depth to her natural beauty), and eventually, with the aid of a handsome, powerful man and the perfect Hermes bag, triumphs. No one whines. They act. The world bursts with possibilities.</p>
        <p>It's a winning formula. Her books have sold 85 million copies in 52 languages. ''The boys gang has always resented me,'' she said. ''Sidney Sheldon, Irving Wallace, Harold Robbins. It was like 'How dare she do that?' And being from Hollywood, the press would describe my house as a mansion when it's a perfectly normal house. They made me the glamorous character from my novels, but those characters were written by someone in J. Crew sweats who's not glamorous at all.''</p>
        <p>Well, maybe not when she's writing, but she was certainly turning heads at Saks. Though she said she was ''out of uniform'' by not wearing Chanel, she was flawlessly dressed in a pink and gray tweed pantsuit with a matching coat, custom made by a Milanese tailor. The Van Cleef &amp; Arpels Bois de Rose, a white coral pin in the shape of a flower with diamonds at the center, reflected the luster of her South Seas pearl earrings and -- just as they do in her books -- seemed to add a glow to her ivory complexion. As she tore through the meager offerings of Gucci and Fendi with the sharp eye of a military commander, the sales staff instinctively stood back. They, not to mention their merchandise, were distinctly outclassed.</p>
        <p>''Now look at that,'' Mrs. Krantz fumed, holding up a transparent lime green Fendi skirt and top. ''Tell me, have you ever seen a woman in a restaurant in a transparent top? Well, me neither.''</p>
        <p>Gucci fared no better. ''That is the worst knocked-off thing,'' she said, fingering a python print dress. ''And the length is wrong. The fitter at Chanel will always say, 'Mrs. Krantz, hemlines are going down.' But I don't care. My skirts stay 19 inches from the floor. That's what looks best on me.''</p>
        <p>Though Mrs. Krantz is a clothes connoisseur, it is a mistake to think her books are about shopping, even though ''Scruples'' was the name of a fashion boutique. They are instead about the transforming power of clothes.</p>
        <p>''I always use clothes for manipulation, to create an effect,'' she explained earlier at lunch at Le Cirque 2000. ''With the right clothes, the character suddenly appears. In many cases, the clothes reveal a personality that was obscured by poverty. I write about clothes as magical things that can change you. I feel that women are comforted by having clothes and accessories. I have every scarf I've ever bought.''</p>
        <p>These days, Mrs. Krantz rarely goes shopping. ''I can't stand it,'' she said of going to malls. ''Anyway, California is not a dressed up place. At every dinner party people wear black, which annoys me. I don't wear black at night. I want to be more visible.''</p>
        <p>Among her other fashion dictums, Mrs. Krantz says, she has never worn jeans or a bikini (unflattering), swears by Hanro lingerie (no seams) and thinks that as an accessory ''burgundy is the best neutral.''  She also declares that she doesn't ''believe in plastic surgery below the neck'' because people should diet and exercise. What about breasts? She shrugged. ''So they droop,'' she said. ''Certain things just happen.''</p>
        <p>Perched on a banquette in the restaurant, her coat bundled behind her, the writer in Mrs. Krantz took over from the strident fashion expert. She appeared small and tentative as she watched other women parade past, bedecked and bejeweled, as if they were characters in her books. The closer she observed, the smaller she seemed to become. You can see why she says that it is the character of the best friend that reflects her in her books, not the heroines.</p>
        <p>''The heroine bears the burden of the plot and always has dramatic things happen to her,'' she said. ''Her mother dies, her father dies, some guy leaves her. The best friend is along for the ride having a wonderful time, wearing crazy clothes that wouldn't be becoming to a heroine, who must have a certain dignity and gravitas. The heroines I create are all bigger than life. But the best friend is a life-size person.'' She smiled. ''Usually short.''</p>
        <p>Her own outfit matched neither description; rather, it belonged to the grande dame character, the doyenne who long ago learned the value of quality. She kept talking as she ate her shad and bacon -- possibly the only woman in the room not picking at a salad -- and said that flying lessons had  prompted her to start writing novels.</p>
        <p>''I was always so afraid to fly, and when I finally learned how, I think it made me write 'Scruples','' she said. ''I thought, What else am I terrified of doing? Writing fiction. I'm not sure why. I think I was a victim of a very good education. I majored in English literature and said, 'I know I can't do that, so why do it at all?' But there is a real place for a book that's not George Eliot but is still for intelligent women.''</p>
        <p>Another reason Mrs. Krantz may have waited, she said, was because of her mother. Mickey Tarcher sounds like a nightmare in Mrs. Krantz's memoir, though her independence was certainly exemplary. She dropped out of school at 14 to work in a candy factory to help support her family. After she married J. D. Tarcher, who became a successful advertising executive, she earned her college degree, a master's in economics and a law degree. She spent her career at the Legal Aid Society and her time at home raising, and often criticizing, her daughters, Judy and Mimi, and her son, Jeremy. She also endured a lifetime of cheating from her husband; when he died in 1960, she sold the weekend home he loved and its contents within two days. She dressed her children cheaply, withholding material rewards as consistently as she withheld emotional ones.</p>
        <p>''My dream was that my mother would come home with a big package from Best with cashmere sweaters for me,'' Mrs. Krantz said, her voice growing full. ''That's where I got the magic of clothes, because my mother didn't give them to me. If she had, I never would have known the power, magic and mystery clothes could have. Out of that yearning you get fiction.''</p>
        <p>It is probably no accident that in 10 Judith Krantz novels, six of her heroines have mothers who die when their daughters are younger than 8.</p>
        <p>In her real life, Mrs. Krantz has been married to the film and television producer Steve Krantz for 46 years. Their son Nick is a stockbroker, their son Tony is the chief executive of Imagine Television, and the couple have two grandchildren.</p>
        <p>For the first time in years, she hasn't started her next novel. ''I have a crazy plan not to do anything and see what happens,'' she said. ''I'd love to do something different, have a life change. There are so many things I don't know yet.''</p>
        <p>As she spoke, her blue eyes sparkled. And the air filled with the unmistakable sense of possibility.</p>
