        <p>Vicente Fox Quesada, the leading opposition presidential candidate, gave a vigorous but level-headed performance on Friday night in a televised debate with two rivals that helped him recover from embarrassing mistakes in his campaign this week.</p>
        <p>Analysts who dissected the 90-minute face-off -- and telephone polling -- agreed that Mr. Fox won the encounter by keeping his cool, downplaying attacks on his opponents and stressing proposals to bring a wide range of Mexicans into his programs for change.</p>
        <p>A leftist opposition contender, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, made points by continually assailing his rivals, although his main target was Francisco Labastida Ochoa of the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI.</p>
        <p>The post-mortem consensus was that Mr. Labastida's bland showing, and the fire he took from both rivals, put him in third place for the debate.</p>
        <p>All three candidates had acknowledged that the debate, the second and last televised meeting between presidential contenders, was pivotal to their prospects in the July 2 balloting. Opinion polls showed Mr. Fox ahead in the race briefly earlier this month, but he has recently fallen back into a dead heat with Mr. Labastida. Mr. Cardenas is a distant third.</p>
        <p>Because of electoral reforms since the last presidential vote in 1994, the field is more level for opponents to compete with the PRI, which has held presidential power for seven decades.</p>
        <p>The changes have made for the most dynamic race Mexicans have ever seen as polls shift from week to week in response to the campaigns. The candidates agreed to a free-wheeling format that allowed for unusually spontaneous exchanges.</p>
        <p>In a national telephone poll conducted Friday night by the daily newspaper Reforma, 47 percent of those contacted said Mr. Fox was the winner, 19 percent named Mr. Labastida and 18 percent Mr. Cardenas. Responding to a separate question that asked who was the loser, 43 percent named Mr. Labastida.</p>
        <p>Mr. Labastida sought to appear presidential by avoiding personal attacks, ignoring his opponents' jabs and sticking with an upbeat roster of his proposals to improve education and fight crime. But his rhetoric was often vague, making him sound like a bureaucrat instead of a man keen to prove himself against Mr. Fox.</p>
        <p>''He was the voice of the system,'' said Enrique Krauze, a political commentator on the Televisa network. ''His language was too institutional and antiquated.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Labastida did not stress that he would change the PRI to eliminate the corruption which has alienated many voters, but neither was he forceful in defending his party's accomplishments in government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox was fighting for his political life. He needed to repair damage he inflicted on himself with peevish behavior in negotiations on live television where he tried to force the other two contenders in to an on-the-spot debate on Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox started out by apologizing to viewers for the stubbornness he showed earlier, but he said it was the product of firm character. ''Do you think a weak and gray person could stand up to the PRI and its allies?'' he asked.</p>
        <p>He trumped his opponents with a bit of theater when Mr. Cardenas hammered at him about the support of his party, the right-of-center National Action Party, for an unpopular $80 billion bail-out of the Mexican banks.</p>
        <p>Several political parties in the Congress are holding secret codes needed to open a computer file that contains the names of Mexicans who benefited from the bailout. Although the opposition parties believe that the files will show extensive corruption in the bailout, they have not agreed on opening them.</p>
        <p>With a flourish intended to show that he will not protect corrupt bankers, Mr. Fox handed the secret codes belonging to his party ''for safekeeping'' to the moderator of the debate, Ricardo Rocha, an independent journalist. Mr. Fox said he will open the bail-out files if he becomes president.</p>
        <p>When he did not get his way over the date of the debate, Mr. Fox suggested petulantly that he would not participate in it at all. After emergency meetings with leaders of his party, he agreed to appear.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cardenas, after siding with Mr. Labastida against Mr. Fox over when to hold the debate, went out of his way to show that he is no friend of the governing party candidate. He worked hard to link Mr. Labastida to Carlos Salinas de Gortari, the disgraced former president who is now in forced exile in Ireland.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cardenas sought to portray himself as a consistent crusader for democracy. ''I'm still fighting the fight and I will always be just as you have always seen me, as a man of principle,'' he said.</p>
