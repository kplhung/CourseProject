        <p>The second annual Foxwoods Open at the world's largest casino, in the woods of Connecticut on Easter weekend, ended in a tie among five grandmasters: Babakuli Annakov of Turkmenistan; Alex Yermolinsky of El Cerrito, Calif.; Alexander Shabalov of Pittsburgh; Gregory Serper of Mayfield Heights, Ohio; and Maurice Ashley of Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Each of the five winners scored 5 1/2 points in the seven-round, 90-entrant Swiss-system tournament, and each received $3,940 in prize money.</p>
        <p>By holding chess tournaments, Foxwoods joins a tradition of casino-sponsored chess that goes back many years and has featured Las Vegas, Monte Carlo and Mar del Plata in Argentina. But it is safe to say that never before have the chess players had to avoid the distraction of 350 gambling tables and 5,500 slot machines.</p>
        <p>In the sixth round, Maurice Ashley demonstrated a nice mating attack in his victory over the Moldova grandmaster Viktor Bologan.</p>
        <p>The Paulsen Variation of the Sicilian Defense, brought about by 4 . . . a6, is as laid back as you can get. Black counts on his a6 and e6 pawns to cover his invasion points while he develops his pieces flexibly.</p>
        <p>With 10 a4, Ashley pushed Bologan to advance with 10 . . . b4.</p>
        <p>With 12 Nf2, he bolstered his e4 pawn, discouraging a counter with . . . d5.</p>
        <p>His 13 a5 cut off Bologan's b4 pawn from support. After 15 Qe3, the b4 pawn could not be defended.</p>
        <p>Ashley's extra b pawn was doubled and, for the moment, ineffective. Perhaps Bologan should have aimed for counterplay with 28 . . . Na7 followed by 29 . . . Nb5 and doubling rooks on the c file.</p>
        <p>Instead, he blocked the b4 pawn with 28 . . . Rb5, which made it that much harder for him to return this rook to defend against Ashley's organization of an attack on the black king.</p>
        <p>After 32 h4!, 32 . . . Bh4? loses material to 33 Rf7 Qf7 34 Rf7 Rf7 35 Qh4. So, the black bishop was banished from the defense with 32 . . . Be3 33 R5f3 Ba7.</p>
        <p>After 36 Qf7, Bologan could not play 36 . . . Kh8? because of 37 Ne5! de 38 Rh6! gh 39 Be5mate. But after 36 . . . Kh7, Ashley's 37 Bd2! threatened 38 Rh6mate.</p>
        <p>If 37 . . . Kh8, then 38 Bh6! Qg4 39 Bg5 Nf5 40 Qb7 Ng3 (or 40 . . . Qe4 41 Qe4 Ng3 42 Kh2 Ne4 43 Rf8) 41 Kh2 Nf1 42 Rf1 puts Bologan a piece down.</p>
        <p>Bologan played 37 . . . Ng8, but after 38 Qg6 Kh8 39 Rf7, seeing that he would have to give up his queen to prevent mate, he gave up.</p>
