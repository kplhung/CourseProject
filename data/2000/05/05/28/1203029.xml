        <p>In another department store, a rare-book shop might seem odd. But at Bergdorf Goodman, that grand lady of Fifth Avenue department stores, it seems appropriate to pick up a copy of ''Marlene Dietrich's ABC's'' after you've browsed through the cocktail dresses, or Elsie De Wolfe's ''House in Good Taste'' when you've settled on a set of crystal dessert bowls. Now that Jane Stubbs's rare-book shop has opened on the seventh floor, you can do just that.</p>
        <p>The shop, a nook in the home furnishings department, opened in December. It is a scaled-down version of the one Ms. Stubbs ran for about seven years at 70th and Lexington (Stubbs Books and Prints), which she closed in 1997 when the rent became too high.</p>

        <p>In another department store, a rare-book shop might seem odd. But at Bergdorf Goodman, that grand lady of Fifth Avenue department stores, it seems appropriate to pick up a copy of ''Marlene Dietrich's ABC's'' after you've browsed through the cocktail dresses, or Elsie De Wolfe's ''House in Good Taste'' when you've settled on a set of crystal dessert bowls. Now that Jane Stubbs's rare-book shop has opened on the seventh floor, you can do just that.</p>
        <p>The shop, a nook in the home furnishings department, opened in December. It is a scaled-down version of the one Ms. Stubbs ran for about seven years at 70th and Lexington (Stubbs Books and Prints), which she closed in 1997 when the rent became too high.</p>
        <p>''Someone from Bergdorf's contacted me with the idea of opening there a while after I closed the shop,'' Ms. Stubbs said. ''I closed the store at a very difficult period in my life, and I sort of retreated into the night. So I didn't really know if anyone would remember the old shop.''</p>
        <p>An early test run proved that people did remember. Ms. Stubbs says she thinks that rare books, which she buys at estate sales and from collectors, are having a heyday. ''There is something about books with a history that is just being understood,'' she said, adding she is thrilled that her shop has a new life at Bergdorf's. Book prices are $75 to $3,700.</p>
        <p>The books are charmingly eclectic,  from ''The History of Ladies Underwear'' (1966), $250, with a saucy pink and black lace cover; a little-known John Steinbeck novel, ''The Short Reign of Pippin IV'' (1957), in which an amateur astronomer is reluctantly persuaded to take the throne of France; Georgina Battiscombe's 1949 ''English Picnics,'' $85; and Marjorie Salter and Adrienne Allen Whitney's ''Delightful Food'' (1957).</p>
        <p>''I have a particular sense of humor and range of interests,'' says Ms. Stubbs, who names Oliver Messel's drawings of dancing roasts of beef in ''Delightful Food'' as an example of her taste.</p>
        <p>Original prints are also available. For nearly the same price as a reproduction, Ms. Stubbs says, people can buy ''something with its own integrity.''</p>
        <p>There are drawings by Emlen Etting,  who, Ms. Stubbs said, was a Philadelphia artist and bon vivant who covered the Paris fashion shows in the 50's and included bits of gossip and funny details about the proceedings in his sketches. They would look just right hanging above your copy of ''Dior's Little Dictionary of Fashion.''</p>
