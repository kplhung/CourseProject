        <p>CHALLENGES to property taxes in Nassau County fell this year for the first time in a decade, a shift that is being ascribed to increasing property values. At the same time, officials are stepping up efforts to tackle the backlog of pending commercial property-tax grievances, some of which stretch back seven years.</p>
        <p>But looming over the whole process of unscrambling Nassau's finances is a 50-year-old system that requires the county to refund even those taxes that have been paid through the county to towns, school districts and smaller taxing authorities. Such ''non-county'' refunds account for more than 80 percent of the money returned to those who win challenges, officials estimate.</p>
        <p>To address the issue of commercial tax challenges, John P. Marcin, chairman of the newly formed Nassau County Assessment Review Commission, said, the County Attorney's office had begun sending him cases ripe for settlement.</p>
        <p>''We figure we can do 100 a month,'' Mr. Marcin said. ''We want to clear the decks of the smaller stuff so that the County Attorney and our appraisers can get on with the larger cases in court. Our objective is to cut the backlog in a reasonable manner without giving away the kitchen sink.</p>
        <p>''The County Executive and the Legislature are on my back to get the cases settled so that we can end the interest problem. If they proceed in court to judgment, they are entitled to collect 9 percent from the date of filing. And that is what's killing us.''</p>
        <p>The Presiding Officer of the County Legislature, Judy Jacobs, a Democrat from Woodbury, said that each year for the past decade, the county has had to pay $100 million to $120 million to those who have won reductions in property taxes. ''How could anyone question why the county finds itself in the economic situation it is in now?'' she asked. An estimated 87 percent went to commercial property owners.</p>
        <p>The county is also hurt by the fact that it is legally responsible for refunding tax overpayments to school districts and towns, when the county's share of the average tax bill is only about 19 percent. She said that changing this practice, which dates to 1948, would ''have a disastrous effect on school districts.''</p>
        <p>''It's a very touchy issue,'' she added. ''It would be harder to change than even reassessment. But that's why we're bleeding.''</p>
        <p>Robert Lazaro, press secretary to the Republican Caucus of the Nassau County Legislature, said ''people getting the benefit of the tax dollar should be responsible for putting it back, but the school lobby is so powerful that it will never be changed.''</p>
        <p>Until this year, Nassau County had a five-member Board of Assessment Review that handled residential grievances. All commercial grievances were automatically forwarded to the County Attorney's office to be handled in State Supreme Court. But understaffing in the attorney's office, combined with the flood of 15,000 to 20,000 commercial filings each year, resulted in a backlog of thousands.</p>
        <p>In previous years, commercial and residential claimants had to file their grievances in the first three weeks of January. This year the deadline was extended to March 1.</p>
        <p>The Board of Assessment Review then heard residents' grievances through April, when it disbanded. ''And then our rights were cut off,'' said Mr. Marcin, a lawyer who also sat on the review board, ''and we couldn't follow through.''</p>
        <p>To rectify that situation, the county and state established a nine-member Assessment Review Commission this year that is to work year-round. Mr. Marcin said the first thing the commission did was to begin hearing commercial cases in addition to residential ones.</p>
        <p>''We did between 60 to 70 commercial cases,'' he said. ''We found that in many instances they were overvalued, and so we gave about 70 percent of them reductions.''</p>
        <p>The commission also handled 4,000 to 5,000 residential cases, compared with 3,000 to 4,000 the previous year, and denied about 70 percent of them. It had to conclude its work by mid-March because the Department of Assessment needed two weeks to certify the tax rolls by April 1.</p>
        <p>In the past, residents' grievances that were not reviewed were automatically submitted to Small Claims Court. Of the 70,000 grievances filed this year, about 5,000 were disposed of by the commission and another 15,000 -- including 1,000 commercial cases -- were set aside for later review. The other residential cases were denied without review, and 41,400 of those went on to file petitions with the Small Claims Court.</p>
        <p>''The rest chose not to appeal because of the increase in property values,'' Mr. Marcin said, noting that there were 39,527 petitions to Small Claims Court last year and 34,068 in 1998. Of the petitions this year, 37,900 were filed against the county, 3,400 against villages and 32 against Glen Cove and Long Beach. The 70,000 grievances filed this year were 10,000 fewer than last year.</p>
        <p>''The number has consistently grown over the years, and this is the first time it has dropped,'' Mr. Marcin said. ''The reason is that the market price of housing has increased so substantially that we have not been granting reductions as we used to. We base our valuations on comparative market price.''</p>
        <p>Tax-assessment lawyers were responsible for the dramatic increase in grievances, Mr. Marcin said, because they sent out mass mailings to homeowners telling them that their homes might be overassessed and offering to file grievances. These lawyers, he said, ''rode the decline all the way down in the 90's, and now that property values are turning in the opposite direction, they are not doing so well.''</p>
        <p>Donald Leistman, a partner in a Mineola law firm, Koeppel Martone Leistman &amp; Herman, agreed, noting that some home prices had risen 20 percent in two years. ''And the way the game is played, that adversely affects somebody seeking a tax reduction,'' he said. Residential appeals used to total about $25 million a year, he added, and now amount to less than half that.</p>
