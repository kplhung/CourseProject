        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has loads of plans, and they are beginning to make some Democrats nervous.</p>
        <p>The presumptive Republican nominee set out some ideas on reducing nuclear weapons, the latest in a series of pronouncements over the past several weeks on everything from Social Security to moving the United States Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.</p>
        <p>That Vice President Al Gore has assumed a more passive posture in articulating his agenda has not been lost on his own party. And some of his supporters, with an eye on Mr. Bush's rising poll numbers, began expressing their anxieties publicly.</p>
        <p>''People are starting to ask, 'When does he get started?' '' said Representative Charles B. Rangel, a New York Democrat.</p>
        <p>With two months until the Republicans meet in Philadelphia for the first of the two presidential nominating conventions, nerves are beginning to fray. The Republicans say the Democratic National Committee is about to start a big television campaign on behalf of Mr. Gore; the Democrats say the Republicans are already waging a television guerrilla war, with attack ads by special-interest groups on both the East and West Coasts.</p>
        <p>The National Rifle Association, in a boisterous convention in Charlotte, N.C., put the vice president on alert that it will organize gun owners against him. Holding a replica of a colonial musket in the air, Charlton Heston, the N.R.A. president, declared, ''I'll give up my gun when you take it from my cold, dead hands.''</p>
        <p>State Democratic leaders, meanwhile, descended on Nashville to plan and make their own declaration of solidarity. Some 72 party leaders from around the country met with Mr. Gore on Thursday, and afterward several remarked that it was not only too early to worry about the polls, but also that Mr. Bush will not seem such a fresh face in time.</p>
        <p>Molly Beth Malcolm, chairwoman of the Texas Democratic Party, likened the governor to a guy in college everyone wants to date but would never possibly get serious about. ''You know you'll have a good time,'' she told reporters, ''but he's not who anybody wants to marry.''</p>
