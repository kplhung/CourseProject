        <p>THE FREE THINKERS</p>
        <p>Two Novellas.</p>
        <p>By Layle Silbert.</p>
        <p>Seven Stories, $25.</p>
        <p>For the melancholy immigrants in Layle Silbert's new book -- it's a collection of stories grouped into two novellas -- the American dream turns out to be a troubled one; the promise of freedom and prosperity is accompanied by anxiety, guilt and regret. In the title novella, Ida, a single working woman in 1920's Chicago, decides to live with a man out of wedlock -- thus halting the relentless matchmaking of her married sister. She prides herself on being a liberated thinker (''Why else had she been brought to America as a child, if not to do as she wished?''), but to her disappointment, her bold move brings not only the same domestic drudgery as marriage but the scorn of the community as well. When she sets out in search of a better life in Palestine, an unexpected delay in New York gives her time to waver between her old life and an uncertain future in a new land, until an advice columnist for The Jewish Daily Forward reluctantly helps her define her thinking. The other novella, ''The Idealists,'' follows the lives of four siblings who emigrate from Russia to Chicago, where they have a bittersweet reunion with their mother. (They also obtain spouses, as well as the rudiments of English.) Among the most engaging characters here is Yudl, a former political prisoner who marries one of the sisters. When his nephew is hit by a truck on the Sabbath, he puts into words the malaise that underlies the stories in this often impressive book: ''It wasn't an accident. It was America, the true nature of America.''</p>
