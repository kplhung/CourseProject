        <p>''IT comes up in every meeting,'' said Jeffrey M. Applegate, chief United States strategist at Lehman Brothers. '' 'Jeff, what is the risk of a hard landing?' ''</p>
        <p>Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment officer at Donald Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, and Douglas R. Cliggott, United States equity strategist at J. P. Morgan Securities, are both hearing the same question, one that has been popping up in client meetings since the Federal Reserve raised its short-term interest rate target by half a percentage point, to 6.5 percent on May 16.</p>
        <p>''There is a growing minority that believes the Fed could prove to be too heavy-handed, too aggressive,'' said Mr. Galvin.</p>
        <p>''It's a question that is being asked a lot more and it makes sense,'' Mr. Cliggott added. ''It's going to be tough to land this thing gently,'' he said, referring to attempts to slow America's rapid economic growth without triggering a recession.</p>
        <p>A recession? Yes, a recession. The mere fact that the big clients of these equity strategists are asking the question shows just how quickly the mood in the stock market has changed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Applegate, Mr. Galvin and Mr. Cliggott do not think that a recession is likely, but they acknowlege that the risk has risen. Real signs of inflationary pressures and the refusal, so far, by the American economy to slow down appreciably are already forcing the Fed to be aggressive in raising interest rates. And that just increases the risk of a mistake, that is, a recession.</p>
        <p>This mood change has helped fuel the market selloff since the Fed's rate increase. The Nasdaq index is off 13.1 percent since then, while the Dow Jones industrial average has fallen 5.8 percent and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index has dropped 6 percent.</p>
        <p>Edward McKelvey, senior economist at Goldman Sachs, said the mood change was ''all rooted in an increasing amount of evidence that the labor market is too tight for comfort,'' which forced the Fed to be more aggressive.</p>
        <p>He said there were two modes that Fed policy makers might be in when they raise their benchmark Federal funds rate on loans between banks. They might be trying to slow growth to a manageable, noninflationary pace before inflation becomes a problem. That is what the Fed did in 1994 and 1995, with its last big series of rate increases. And it is what the group appears to have aimed for since last June, with five moderate, quarter-point increases in the Fed funds rate.</p>
        <p>The Fed's other mode is to be intent on stamping out rising inflation, Mr. McKelvey said. If the Fed were to enter this mode, he said, the central bank would probably slow growth to below the 3.5 percent sustainable pace in order to subdue inflation. But that is risky. Mr. McKelvey says that the Fed has rarely shifted into that mode without the economy ending up in a recession.</p>
        <p>He does not know what mode the Fed is in now. And he speculates that one would get ''10 different answers'' at the Fed, a reference to the 10 members of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets the central bank's interest rate policy.</p>
        <p>But Mr. McKelvey notes this interesting -- and possibly not irrelevant -- fact: Since World War II, when the three-month moving average of the nation's unemployment rate rose more than 0.3 of a percentage point, the economy wound up in a recession within a year.</p>
        <p>The three-month moving average now is 4.03 percent, down from 4.07 percent the previous three months and the lowest it has been since February 1970. If this indicator held to historic form, a move up to 4.4 percent would be a really bad signal.</p>
        <p>So, can the policy makers avoid a hard landing and push up the unemployment rate without tripping into a recession? This expansion has already broken many rules economists have long lived by. So maybe this time will be different. Maybe.</p>
