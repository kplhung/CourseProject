        <p>BETSY D. HOLDEN, the new chief executive at Kraft Foods, never disguised her ambitions for such a post, and never saw her sex as an obstacle.</p>
        <p>''When I was in college, I said I really want to run a business and I want to be C.E.O.,'' she said in an interview at Kraft's sprawling headquarters in this Chicago suburb.</p>
        <p>A week ago, at the age of 44, Ms. Holden was granted her wish when she was named to the top job at Kraft, a position that makes her one of the  highest-ranking women in corporate America.</p>
        <p>Only Carly Fiorina, the chief executive at Hewlett-Packard, runs a bigger operation. Ms. Holden, a 16-year veteran of Kraft, a unit of Phillip Morris, now heads the nation's largest food packager, with more than $18 billion in revenue and some of the world's most recognizable brands, such as Jello, Oscar Mayer, Maxwell House, and Kraft cheese.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Holden, a commanding presence even at 5-foot-4, is wary that what she is will overshadow what she does. ''Sometimes, there's more emphasis put on the fact that you're a woman than results,'' she says, standing outside her newly decorated executive suite. ''At the end of the day, it's the results that count.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Holden has zoomed up the ranks at Kraft by delivering big results, even while making her workplace more friendly for other women. She was the head of Kraft's pizza division from 1993 to 1995, when Tombstone became a national brand and DiGiorno was launched. In a business viewed as mature, she achieved record sales and profit growth. Promoted to lead the cheese division, she  became known around the company as the ''Cheese Whiz.''</p>
        <p>''She's been a rising star in the industry,'' said John McMillin, a food analyst at Prudential Securities.</p>
        <p>She was born in Texas on her brother's second birthday and delivered by her own father, a former military flight surgeon who later settled the family near Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>In high school, she was a cheerleader and a student council member. She studied education at Duke and graduated summa cum laude.</p>
        <p>Children and teaching, she says, have always been her passion. So she briefly taught fourth-grade before entering Kellogg Graduate School of Management at Northwestern University. ''I loved the kids and it was very fulfilling,'' she said of her teaching. ''But I was looking for something to combine the creative and the analytical.''</p>
        <p>At Kellogg, she was a standout. She became valedictorian and was named outstanding marketing student. She worked first at General Foods before moving to Kraft in 1984. ''Kraft was very good to me,'' she says. ''Any time my learning curve started to falter, I was moved along.''</p>
        <p>Kraft executives were impressed by her teamwork, competitive drive and inventiveness.</p>
        <p>As a teacher, she created learning games for children, even working part-time for Milton Bradley. She applied that same ingenuity, colleagues say, to building Kraft's brands.</p>
        <p>She even invented cheers for her Kraft team, something her colleagues kid her about. An example is framed outside her office: an image of her face pasted onto a cheerleader's body, under Ms. Holden's cheer for the cheese division: ''Every day and every way, grow Kraft cheese, hey!''</p>
        <p>Ms. Holden also had a knack for organization, even regimentation. She charted, listed, categorized and logically plotted not just her rise to power, but her family life.</p>
        <p>She's not a workaholic, she says. But she has mastered the balance between work and the rest of her life by setting priorities and finding activities that fulfill many of her different interests, like her volunteer work with the Off the Street Club, a boys and girls club for impoverished children in a tough part of Chicago.</p>
        <p>The club gets financial support from the marketing community in Chicago. So it's a way for her to network, teach and spend time with her own children, a son, age 12, and a daughter, 9, as she invites many of the other children to her home for sleepovers.</p>
        <p>Ms. Holden still teaches Sunday School, along  with her husband, Arthur, chief executive of the SNP Consortium, a local organization involved in  mapping the human genome. When she became a mother she organized a group at Kraft called Women -- or Working Mom's Exchange Network -- which delegated to its members everything from researching preschools to writing wills.</p>
        <p>Now, Ms. Holden is delegating much larger duties. She says Kraft wants to be the ''undisputed leader of the food industry,'' an industry with a slowing growth rate.</p>
        <p>Kraft, however, has outperformed most of its peers. Analysts speculate that Kraft could make a bid for Nabisco, or that Philip Morris could spin Kraft off as an independent company, but Ms. Holden declines comment.</p>
        <p>Her task, she says, is to cut costs, make acquisitions, come up with innovative marketing plans and further expand into nutritional foods.</p>
        <p>''All you have to do is look at the aging population and genomics,'' she says. ''In a year or two you'll be able to get a genetic profile of yourself, and be able to alter your diet.''</p>
        <p>Kraft is also focusing on creating more convenient, ready-to-serve foods for meals and snacks. ''People are multi-tasking,'' she says, ''They're feeling stressed.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Holden's confidence that only the results of those efforts will count was bolstered by hearing, after word had spread around Kraft that she was the new chief, that her gender was not even a topic of discussion. She also learned that there were several other women candidates.</p>
        <p>''When I heard that, I said: 'Yes!' '' she said, pumping her fist. '' 'That's the way it ought to be.' ''</p>
