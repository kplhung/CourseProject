        <p>Letter from Douglas Mattern says nuclear powers could prove they are sincere about need for nonproliferation by agreeing to take all nuclear weapons off alert status, followed by timetable for elimination of nuclear weapons</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>By the end of the recent United Nations conference on nonproliferation (news article, May 22), the five nuclear powers had strengthened their language on disarmament and pledged ''an unequivocal undertaking'' to ''accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament to which all states parties are committed.'' This is encouraging, but it could be meaningless without a timetable.</p>
        <p>Words alone will not reduce the nuclear threat. Immediate action and constant public pressure are required.</p>

        <p>The next opportunity for progress is the United Nations millennium assembly in September. The nuclear powers could prove they are sincere by agreeing to take all nuclear weapons off alert status, followed by a firm timetable for elimination of nuclear weapons.</p>
