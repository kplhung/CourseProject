        <p>Of all the things he is being called lately by his critics, ''liberal'' and ''dove'' make Gov. Tom Ridge laugh out loud.</p>
        <p>''I'll bet the only combat ever seen by the guy who wrote that has been in front of a Nintendo machine,'' said Mr. Ridge, his credentials as a Bronze Star combat veteran of Vietnam unsullied by the slings and arrows now pelting him from within his own Republican Party.</p>
        <p>The Vietnam-fighting experience of the husky, 55-year-old Pennsylvania governor comes in handy these days. He is being targeted by the social conservative right for being a Roman Catholic who unapologetically favors a woman's right to choose abortion, yet remains prominently featured on a list of potential running mates of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the putative Republican presidential nominee.</p>
        <p>''The governor says there is no litmus test, and I believe him,'' Mr. Ridge said, referring to the simmering abortion issue.</p>
        <p>But social and religious conservatives see things differently, and have issued stern warnings to Mr. Bush of dire consequences in November if he picks someone like Mr. Ridge.</p>
        <p>''The base in the Republican Party is pro-life,'' James C. Dobson, the conservative religious leader, said on Wednesday. ''You can't win without that base.''</p>
        <p>Governor Ridge, his abortion rights stand firmly defying party platform dogma, remains the most mentioned prospective running mate. He set a Republican record for this heavily Democratic state with a 780,000-vote victory margin in his 1998 re-election. A Bush-Ridge ticket might well deliver this critical battleground, the fifth-largest state in electoral votes, to the Republicans.</p>
        <p>In two elections, Mr. Ridge has shown considerable crossover attraction among Democratic voters. He has the power to garner up to 30 percent of them, according to polls -- a factor that Mr. Bush must weigh as he charts a centrist strategy.</p>
        <p>Other Republicans also note that Mr. Bush had to be more sensitive to the nation's large Catholic vote after his controversial speech in the South Carolina primary at Bob Jones University, a campus that critics denounce as anti-Catholic.</p>
        <p>And while Mr. Ridge's support of abortion rights might signal a harsh party split for some Republicans, others say his candidacy as vice president would draw more women to the Republican ticket.</p>
        <p>''All this wonderful speculation,'' remarked Governor Ridge, his smile broad but fatalistic as he noted that the decision on a running mate was entirely Mr. Bush's to make after a long process involving ''a lot of other people,'' in the Texas governor's words.</p>
        <p>''What if? What if?'' asked Mr. Ridge, happily teasing himself as much as his boosters and critics. He seems to be enjoying the freedom of having no say in the matter as he looks forward to being the state host at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia this summer.</p>
        <p>But as the vice-presidential question is debated, conservative critics in National Review and other publications, nettled by his support of abortion rights, are busily vetting Mr. Ridge's 12-year record in Congress to argue that, even beyond the abortion issue, he is not an authentic conservative.</p>
        <p>''Protectionist,'' another charge made against Mr. Ridge, brings more open laughter here in the executive chamber of the governor, who noted that he was a card-carrying member of the hod-carriers union when he was a college student who worked in construction during the summers.</p>
        <p>''I voted for Nafta, in Congress,'' Mr. Ridge said, bemused at what he was reading lately from conservative polemicists.</p>
        <p>''I mean, this gets comical,'' he continued. He repeatedly used the word ''conservative'' to characterize himself in an interview.</p>
        <p>Only the November election, he said, with all the variables brought to the voters by the candidates and their campaigns, might settle the question of whether the Republican Party is ready for an abortion rights candidate on the ticket beside the anti-abortion Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>''I think the decibel level may be going down a little bit on this issue,'' said Mr. Ridge, whose political career in Pennsylvania has not measurably suffered from his support of abortion rights, even after his being obliquely criticized by his bishop.</p>
        <p>''But I don't think we're done with the very important struggle we're having within the party as to how to deal with it,'' he continued. ''Certainly, my friend Governor Bush disagrees with me, and a majority of the delegates at the convention probably disagree with me.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, we're not going to change the platform. But it's interesting to note there are some people in the party who, instead of defeating Al Gore, would suggest that if the No. 2, whether me or somebody else, doesn't share their belief on abortion, they might abandon the party.''</p>
        <p>One quarter where Governor Ridge is bolstered in his insistence that he is a true-blue conservative is across the Statehouse, within the Democratic minority.</p>
        <p>''Tom Ridge is a perfect fit for George Bush,'' said State Senator Christine M. Tartaglione, speaking in her role as the state Democratic chairwoman.</p>
        <p>''His actions speak louder than his words,'' Ms. Tartaglione said, contending that Mr. Ridge, in the state's recent tax cuts of more than $1 billion, favored big business interests at the expense of needy families.</p>
        <p>''We all wait for Tom Ridge's leadership,'' she said scornfully.</p>
        <p>The governor's supporters quickly cite a raft of new social welfare and education laws to argue that he is the very model of the ''compassionate conservative'' that Mr. Bush has proclaimed as the cornerstone of his campaign.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Ridge has just the sort of paradoxical touches in his resume that politicians dream of.</p>
        <p>His parents were postwar strivers; his father, a Navy veteran, worked two jobs to finance his children's parochial school tuition. Up from public housing, the family bought a modest house in Erie, Pa., that is still home to the governor's mother.</p>
        <p>''My DNA is a little confused,'' Mr. Ridge said lightly in noting that his father was a fervid blue-collar Democrat while his mother was a no less fervid Republican ward worker. The family dinner table was a forum that respected politics, he said.</p>
        <p>He graduated from Harvard after winning a needs-based scholarship and, while studying at Dickinson Law School in Pennsylvania was drafted into the Army and served in the infantry.</p>
        <p>''I don't dwell on Vietnam; I draw on it,'' said Mr. Ridge who, with a similar margin of removal, recalls the feverish antiwar protests at Harvard as a fascinating backdrop that did not draw him away from his studies.</p>
        <p>As the attacks by social conservatives heighten, the governor does not hesitate to defend his view on abortion rights.</p>
        <p>''This is a difficult personal decision that has enormous emotional, psychological, intensely physical and oftentimes religious dimensions to it,'' he said. ''This is a tough decision for people to make. One of the things I talk about is trust.</p>
        <p>''It comes down to whether I would place ultimate responsibility in that very difficult personal decision, with so many dimensions to it, in the hands of government -- I mean, some of the people in my party would criminalize it! -- or leave it up to the individual, leave it up to the woman.''</p>
        <p>For all the intramural sniping, the old combat sergeant admits he enjoys the extra political notice and power that seems to come with the vice-presidential speculation, however fruitless it may prove.</p>
        <p>''It's the what-if factor,'' Mr. Ridge said, describing a state of ''irrational exuberance'' that he is experiencing.</p>
        <p>''It's a heck of a ride,'' the governor added. ''I've already got a great job, and I'm going to help my old friend George Bush get elected president. And you know? I think he can carry Pennsylvania without me.''</p>
