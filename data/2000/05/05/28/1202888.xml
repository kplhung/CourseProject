        <p>STEVEN AVILES, 25, a cosmetologist from Queens, didn't need a wig. He scooped his shoulder-length, curly reddish hair into a ponytail on top of his head and fastened it with a sparkling rhinestone wrist cuff. Rummaging through his makeup bag, he peered into the dressing room mirror and outlined his sultry lips, then added one more coat of mascara to his already impossibly thick fake lashes.</p>

        <p>STEVEN AVILES, 25, a cosmetologist from Queens, didn't need a wig. He scooped his shoulder-length, curly reddish hair into a ponytail on top of his head and fastened it with a sparkling rhinestone wrist cuff. Rummaging through his makeup bag, he peered into the dressing room mirror and outlined his sultry lips, then added one more coat of mascara to his already impossibly thick fake lashes.</p>
        <p>Standing behind him, Bobby Ojeda, 54, a hospital worker from Queens, admired his longtime companion. He smiled as Mr. Aviles did a pirouette in his purple lame gown (size 8), showing off cleanly shaven legs, slim hips and stiletto pumps. Mr. Aviles clipped on oversized rhinestone earrings. With a final touch of hair spray, Mr. Aviles, known in such attire as Mirkala Crystal, was ready for opening night at the Grove Hotel in Cherry Grove on Fire Island.</p>
        <p>''We'll be out quite often this summer,'' said Mr. Ojeda, who is also Ms. Crystal's manager, lamenting the high cost of the gowns and makeup necessary to keep his partner on the drag-show circuit. Last year, Ms. Crystal was crowned Miss Cherry Grove and represented New York City in the Miss Continental U.S.A. pageant, a drag version of the Miss Universe contest.</p>
        <p>''The people here appreciate it,'' Mr. Ojeda said. ''They like sex on the beach.''</p>
        <p>It was just a tease, more of a party than a full-blown drag show. But the season opener at the Ice Palace, the cavernous nightclub at the Grove Hotel, is part of what makes this mile-long, half-mile-wide strip of beach legendary. Cherry Grove is for many a gay New Yorker the home of summer's promise: sun, sand, sex and a complete lack of inhibition.</p>
        <p>''We have weathered AIDS, we have weathered prejudice, we have weathered hurricanes and life still goes on for us,'' said Sal Piro, 49, the hotel's entertainment director and, when in drag, Dame Edith Piro. ''There's a grand tradition of drag in Cherry Grove. Our drag is first-rate.''</p>
        <p>''It's the illusion,'' said Mr. Piro, a former seminarian and theology teacher. ''Some of these men put the regular women to shame. Normal women don't walk around in $1,000 gowns.''</p>
        <p>Weekdays, in Manhattan, neither does he. ''I don't do drag outside of the island,'' he said. ''I'm more of a comic who puts a dress on.''</p>
        <p>In his day job, Mr. Piro is president of the Rocky Horror Picture Show Fan Club.</p>
        <p>Cherry Grove has long been a mecca for gays, said Isaac Steven Vaughan, 38, a classical pianist and part owner of the hotel.</p>
        <p>''People come to Fire Island to get tanned, twisted and laid,'' Mr. Vaughan said. ''Cherry Grove has a moderately high level of sexual energy for everybody, whether you are gay or straight. It's a cruisey atmosphere. It's a hedonistic little place.''</p>
        <p>Bob Younger, 58, a retired teacher from Queens and winner of the hotel's ''hot buns'' contest last year, insisted that he was straight.</p>
        <p>Mr. Younger, a member of the local fire department, said he owns a home in Cherry Grove, rents out two apartments and is unperturbed by the sexual orientation of most of his neighbors.</p>
        <p>''This community during the summer is adult camp,'' Mr. Younger said. ''There are a lot of fun things that go on here. This is a major part of my life.''</p>
        <p>The beach town, named for the abundance of wild cherry trees, was first settled by a pirate, Jeremiah Smith, who built a cottage here in 1795 so he could easily loot ships that ran aground. In 1880, Archie Perkinson, who bought the square mile of beach to use as a farm, enlarged the Smith house into a two-story hotel. Day trippers soon started coming. Oscar Wilde was one of the first prominent homosexuals to visit. By the Prohibition era, it was an artists' community in full swing. New Yorkers gathered for the freedom, the bootleg liquor and the dancing.</p>
        <p>When the hurricane of 1938 washed away most of Cherry Grove, the hotel was left standing. It became a haven for summering gay writers and artists like W. H. Auden, Tennessee Williams and Truman Capote.</p>
        <p>Over the summer, the hotel, which has 60 cubicle-sized rooms and a pool, books about 2,000 reservations for 4,000 people.</p>
        <p>''In the city and on Long Island, clubs tend to cater to certain crowds,'' Mr. Vaughan said. ''We get the gamut. Everybody is welcome. We're here, we're happy and we don't feel like anybody is our enemy.''</p>
        <p>He was alluding to another local gay social club, the Monster Millennium Restaurant. A civil rights lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Uniondale on May 5 by the Monster's owners, Patrick and Joanne McEvoy of St. James, and the Cherry Grove Chamber of Commerce alleged that Brookhaven town officials violated their first amendment rights in refusing to allow the club to reopen after renovations, and sought damages for anti-gay bias. The club reopened, without permits, on May 13.</p>
        <p>Ariel Sinclair stood by the Ice Palace bar, demurely sipping a drink and acknowledging suggestive glances from other patrons with a shy smile.</p>
        <p>''The whole community has a nice, welcoming feeling,'' said Ms. Sinclair, known when not in drag as Chris Laffin, 32, a hair stylist from Queens. ''It's a gay and lesbian resort. It's a party town.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Sinclair, who does drag shows at clubs in the city during the winter, started the evening as a blond, dressed in a tight-fitting short leopard-print dress with a matching cowboy hat and heels. For the show, she switched to a black wig and short black skirt and high black leather boots. For a lip-sync number, she changed into a long leopard-print coat, flashing feminine black undergarments as she danced.</p>
        <p>''Makeup does wonders,'' Ms. Sinclair said earlier as she powdered and applied makeup to Mr. Piro's face backstage. Then Mr. Piro changed from jeans and a shirt into a funky black and gold gown with oversized feathered cuffs, pulling a fluffy pink wig over his short dark hair to become Dame Edith, hostess of the evening's performance.</p>
        <p>To open the show, Dame Edith lip-synched ''Ruby Red Dress,'' shaking her rather large belly. ''Happy summer everybody!'' she shouted.</p>
        <p>''I've seen big drag queens, but nobody oozes more sex than Viva Sexx,'' she said, introducing a 40-year-old hairdresser from Manhattan, six-foot-two in his stocking feet, who came onstage in five-inch heels. Ms. Sexx, a.k.a. Edwin Peterson, wore a skintight powder-blue dress and matching silk evening gloves. Gay couples, many with arms wrapped around each other, cheered. Jerry Viteritti, 23, a hairdresser who makes wigs for drag queens, hesitated, then moved forward, stuffing dollar after dollar down Ms. Sexx's bodice. Then he danced alongside her.</p>
        <p>''You go girl!'' Dame Edith shouted gleefully, watching the dance floor. ''Isn't she hot?''</p>
        <p>Between numbers, Dame Edith announced the hotel's schedule of special events for the summer. ''The Bachelor/ette Party You Never Had,'' scheduled for June 9 at 9 p.m., kicks off ''The Wedding You Never Had'' weekend, complete with tossing of bouquets and garters, strippers, shower games and free cocktails for anyone wearing sexy lingerie. The poolside 3 p.m.-to-midnight Anniversary Tea Dance, on June 11, is for couples who have been together over decades, or just met a few hours ago. And for the 25th annual invasion of Fire Island Pines on July 2, hundreds of drag queens will journey by boat to the neighboring mostly gay community, imbibe, then return to Cherry Grove for a fashion show by the pool.</p>
        <p>The Grove Hotel's signature event, Dame Edith said, is the Miss Fire Island contest, held the Saturday after Labor Day with 50 contestants in three categories. It draws more than 1,000 people, Mr. Piro said, 80 percent to 90 percent of them straight.</p>
        <p>As the disco music thumped, male couples danced. Off to the side, two women exchanged long, soulful kisses. On a sofa near the bar, one man slid his hand up another's shorts.</p>
        <p>During the summer, Nelson Caraballo, the bar manager who oversees a staff of 15 to 20, is usually known as Annida Grenkard. Dressing in drag, he said, makes his cash register receipts soar.</p>
        <p>But on this particular evening, the season not yet in full swing, Mr. Caraballo donned a tuxedo jacket over slacks. He wore a beret and a faux ruby and rhinestone cross pinned to his lapel signified that he is a member of the Imperial Court of New York, a female impersonators' troupe.</p>
        <p>Until he came to Fire Island four years ago, Mr. Caraballo led a very different sort of life. ''I was in politics,'' said Mr. Caraballo, who worked for a congressman -- he wouldn't say who -- in New York and Washington. He first dressed in drag on a dare.</p>
        <p>''I love the attention,'' he said. ''When I first started I couldn't dress up myself or do my makeup, but I learned it. Cherry Grove is the place where she has grown up and matured and become part of the community. I was trying to find something other than the very straight, uptight political circles I was in. This was the obvious place.</p>
        <p>''There's a freedom you experience out here that you can't find in New York,'' Mr. Caraballo said. ''In the city, you still have to be careful, no matter what. There are certain places a drag queen, female impersonator or a transgender or a gay person can't go without feeling uncomfortable, without being stared at or feeling prejudice. Here, no matter what you do, people embrace you.''</p>
