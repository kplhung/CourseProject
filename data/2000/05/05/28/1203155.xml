        <p>Take a cursory look at the men's draw for the French Open, which begins here Monday, and American tennis appears to remain in fine shape and gifted hands. At the top is the No. 1-seeded player, the defending champion and future Hall of Fame inductee Andre Agassi. At the bottom is the second-seeded and future Hall of Famer Pete Sampras.</p>
        <p>Sampras and Agassi have been the world's most successful and visible players over the last decade: winning 18 Grand Slam singles titles between them and maintaining, with able support from Michael Chang, Todd Martin and the recently retired Jim Courier, the United States' place at the top of the sport.</p>
        <p>But if you look more closely at the handwriting on the wall in Paris, a more troubling picture emerges. Agassi and Sampras are the only Americans who are seeded, and of the eight other American men who will play at Stade Roland Garros, the majority are older than age 24 and no longer at the peak of their careers.</p>
        <p>As for the seven American men who tried to play their way into this Grand Slam event, not one made it past the first round in last week's qualifying tournament. And in the last five Grand Slam events, only two American men have qualified for the main draw: 30-year-old Alex O'Brien at this year's Australian Open and 33-year-old Richey Reneberg at last year's Wimbledon.</p>
        <p>Sampras and Agassi are still motivated and intimidating, but Agassi is now 30 and Sampras is 28 and increasingly injury prone. Where is the next wave? And more important, is there a next wave?</p>
        <p>Nick Bollettieri, the coach whose academy in Bradenton, Fla., was the Darwinian place where Agassi, Courier and other top Americans developed their forehands and attitude, is afraid he knows the answer.</p>
        <p>''We are in for a dry spell,'' he said. ''If you check the New York Yankees out 10 to 15 years ago, they were winning everything, and they forgot their farm team and then went into a tremendous drought. And that is exactly what is going to happen to American men's tennis.''</p>
        <p>Harold Solomon, another prominent American coach and a former French Open finalist, is similarly pessimistic.</p>
        <p>''My true opinion, and I won't win any popularity contests with this, is that our system is an antiquated system as far as producing champions,'' he said. ''They say it's a cyclical thing. But I say no. We have a gap, and it looks like it will be a big gap.''</p>
        <p>Solomon added: ''It's going to be an awful situation in three to four years when all these guys stop. The U.S.T.A. is going to have egg on its face when it's the Round of 16 at the U.S. Open and there are no American players in it. And if there are no American guys around, who in this country is going to want to watch it and follow it?''</p>
        <p>Officials at the United States Tennis Association are well aware of the risk, but they take heart from the excellent recent play of Andy Roddick, a 17-year-old from Boca Raton, Fla., who is the world's top-ranked junior and turned professional in March. They also point to a series of initiatives the organization has begun in the last three years, which include increasing the number of small professional events in the United States, tinkering with the junior tennis system and creating a comprehensive regional network staffed by instructors who have either played or coached at the elite level.</p>
        <p>''When I came into this job two and a half years ago, obviously the question was, 'Where are the next American stars?' '' the U.S.T.A.'s director of player development, Doug MacCurdy, said. ''I'm a little more interested in the whole system of development and ensuring that we have a lot of players to draw from. At our strongest point in men's tennis as a nation, we had a lot of players battling each other and by natural selection some moved into the upper ranks.</p>
        <p>''But a system does not produce a Sampras or Agassi or a Yevgeny Kafelnikov. But a system can produce, like Spain and Sweden have shown, an awful lot of good players, and we have to use that numbers game to our advantage, because I would assume there are probably still a lot more people playing tennis in the United States than anywhere else and recent participation levels are encouraging.''</p>
        <p>It also bears remembering what happened the last time there was widespread concern about the American men's game. That was in the late 1980's, when John McEnroe and Jimmy Connors were in decline. For a three-year span -- from 1986 to 1988 -- no American man reached a Grand Slam singles final, and in 1987, amid gloomy predictions of a long-term void, the U.S.T.A. created its first player development program to help foster and finance young talent at home.</p>
        <p>As it turned out, the next wave was already preparing to break. Agassi reached No. 3 in the world in 1988. In 1989, Chang became the youngest man to win the French Open. Sampras became the youngest man to win the United States Open in 1990, and the following year, Courier broke through, beating Agassi in the French Open final and soon reaching No. 1 in the world.</p>
        <p>End of crisis. End of concern. Until now, when the highest-ranked American man under the age of 25 is Jan-Michael Gambill, currently 67th on the ATP list at age 22. Behind him are 23-year-old Paul Goldstein, who is 79th, and 23-year-old Justin Gimelstob, 99th, followed by six young Americans ranked between 145 and 212: Cecil Mamiit, Michael Russell, Kevin Kim, Bob Bryan, Taylor Dent and James Blake.</p>
        <p>''Although I could certainly not say that here are three players who will fill the shoes of Sampras and Agassi and the others at the top of the game, I do think there will be a certain opening, and somebody will walk through it,'' MacCurdy said.</p>
        <p>Chang agrees that there could be surprises. ''I don't think when we came out that anyone ever thought we were going to do so well, so I think time will tell a lot for the next bunch,'' Chang said. ''But all I know is that I don't think you're going to see a group like our group for a long time. I'm not just talking about the four of us who won Grand Slams. I'm also talking about Todd Martin, Mal Washington, David Wheaton and Jeff Tarango. All these guys were from the same class, and you just don't see that many coming in such a large group behind us.''</p>
        <p>The volume of top American players has been decreasing regularly since the Open era began in 1968. At the United States Open that year, 48 of the 96 players in the men's draw were Americans, as were 51 of the 64 in the women's draw.</p>
        <p>''Look at every decade after that, and it has been a fairly steady decline to where it is now: about 20 percent of the women and 15 percent of the men, and that includes wild cards,'' MacCurdy said. ''I'd attribute that primarily to the growing popularity of and involvement in the game in the rest of the world, and a lot of steps federations and individuals took.''</p>
        <p>Italy was the first nation to begin a national tennis school in the 1970's, but it has been in other European countries like France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Austria and Spain that the greatest developmental strides have been made. Spain has been particularly successful in producing top men's players. At the end of 1999, it had 12 players in the top 100 -- one more than the United States -- even though stars like Alex Corretja and Carlos Moya had poor seasons.</p>
        <p>Spain has succeeded for a variety of reasons. By developing an extensive system of satellite and challenger tournaments, essentially minor leagues, it allowed plenty of chances for its players to acquire experience and ranking points close to home. Many young Spanish coaches were also willing to take financial risks and sacrifice their personal lives by traveling with young prospects on the circuit, and the fact that nearly all the best facilities are in Barcelona meant that the top players could train and develop together frequently.</p>
        <p>''They have each other to compete against, and that's what I had with Andre and Michael,'' Sampras said. ''You need rivals, good competitors at home. It seems to me every time you turn your head in the locker room there's another young Spaniard coming up. Unfortunately in our country, it's a little thin.''</p>
        <p>Another competitive advantage is that because of differences in school requirements, top Spanish players can begin playing full time earlier than Americans. Corretja and the newest Spanish star, Juan Carlos Ferrero, who is seeded 16th in his first French Open, have been playing satellite events since their mid-teens. The same is happening in France and in parts of South America, which has reassumed a prominent position in the men's game in the wake of the success of Chile's Marcelo Rios and the Brazilian Gustavo Kuerten.</p>
        <p>''In the men's game, there are probably a couple of thousand good players who are playing virtually full-time tennis at the ages of 15, 16, 17,'' MacCurdy said. ''Obviously it doesn't work out for a lot of them. But very few American kids at that age would take the risk and say, 'I'm going to just play tennis.' The young professional is a problem for us.''</p>
        <p>To compensate, the U.S.T.A. has increased the number of challenger and satellite events in the United States from 46 in 1993 to 100 this year. It has also increased the number of International Tennis Federation junior events in the United States from 8 to 13 in the last three years. Perhaps most significant, it has sent more full-time coaches on the road with small groups of young professionals who might otherwise lack the means to hire such experts at a critical phase in their careers.</p>
        <p>''I'd say my major goal would be to stop the bleeding that has gone on for such a long while,'' MacCurdy said. ''And to begin to add fairly slowly. I'd love to see one or two additional top 100 players a year.''</p>
        <p>But while Mamiit and Goldstein are still trying to break into the top 70 on the ATP list at age 23, younger players like Lleyton Hewitt of Australia, Marat Safin of Russia, Andreas Vinciguerra of Sweden, Juan Ignacio Chela of Argentina and Ferrero (all 20 or younger) have already won tournaments and are considered major threats in Grand Slam events.</p>
        <p>Precocious success is rarely a coincidence in tennis. Remember Sampras, Agassi and Chang. And unless the Americans can make up lost ground and time in a hurry, it will be very difficult for their fans at home to forget Sampras, Agassi and Chang in the lean years ahead.</p>
