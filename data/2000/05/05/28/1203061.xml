        <p>THE best-selling author in the world managed to ignore both the sexual and the technological revolutions. She survived the whole of the 20th century keeping her love scenes chaste and dictating her work to a secretary.</p>
        <p>When Dame Barbara Cartland died last Sunday at the age of 98, she had written 723 books. She earned a place in the Guinness Book of World Records, with nearly a billion copies sold. And she had become the answer to a Trivial Pursuit question, ''Who has the longest entry in Who's Who?'' The full entry, which lists a staggering array of titles, was once performed as a cabaret act.</p>
        <p>Aspiring authors, take note: If you're planning to stay on top of the best-seller list, your titles should turn heads. Cartland replaced sex with ellipses, but she kept her covers provocative. Judge for yourself.</p>
        <p>JENNY LYN BADER</p>
        <p>Cartland knew that readers of romance novels like to see the plight of the central character revealed in the title -- especially if the character is an anxious virgin or an emotionally unstable aristocrat:</p>
        <p>A Virgin in Mayfair; A Virgin in Paris; The Mysterious Maid-Servant; The Innocent Heiress; The Reluctant Bride; The Frightened Bride; The Unpredictable Bride; The Wicked Marquis; The Impetuous Duchess; The Marquis Who Hated Women; The Odious Duke.</p>
        <p>Even Cartland's histories and biographies have extremely evocative titles:</p>
        <p>The Outrageous Queen: A Biography of Christina of Sweden; Polly: The Story of My Wonderful Mother; Metternich: The Passionate Diplomat; The Private Life of Charles II: The Woman He Loved; The Private Life of Elizabeth, Empress of Austria; The Scandalous Life of King Carol.</p>
        <p>Some of the better titles juxtapose animals and people, or offer incongruous or distressing pairings:</p>
        <p>The Hell-Cat and the King; Diona and a Dalmation; The Prince and the Pekinese; Ola and the Sea Wolf; Sex and the Teenager; The Saint and the Sinner; Lucifer and the Angel; The Goddess and the Gaiety Girl; The Passion and the Flower; The Duke and the Preacher's Daughter; Pride and the Poor Princess; The Prude and the Prodigal.</p>
        <p>As the author of the ''I Love You'' virus recently learned, anyone seeking a large readership should use the word love in a title:</p>
        <p>Love Is an Eagle; Love Is Innocent; Love and the Loathsome Leopard; Love Holds the Cards; Love Climbs In; Love Has His Way; Love Leaves at Midnight; Love Wins; Love Rules; Love is the Key; Love at the Helm; Love to the Rescue; The Explosion of Love; The Perfection of Love; The Windmill of Love; The Castle Made for Love; A Rhapsody of Love; The Vibrations of Love; The Karma of Love; The Twists and Turns of Love; Wish for Love; Love Under Fire; Love in Hiding; Love in the Dark; Never Laugh at Love; Food for Love; Recipes for Lovers; No Time for Love; In the Arms of Love; A Portrait of Love; A Game of Love; A Dynasty of Love; A World of Love; The Goddess of Love; A Gentleman in Love; The Dawn of Love; The Wings of Love; The Drums of Love; The River of Love; The Fire of Love; Signpost to Love; Moments of Love; Little White Doves of Love; Elizabethan Lover; Barbara Cartland's Book of Love and Lovers; Barbara Cartland's Etiquette for Love and Romance; The Ghost Who Fell in Love.</p>
        <p>Yes, human beings are such romantics they will even buy books in which love might be the villain:</p>
        <p>Love Is the Enemy; Love Is Contraband; Love for Sale; Love Locked In; The Judgment of Love; The Many Facets of Love; No Escape From Love; Punished With Love; Armour Against Love; Lies for Love; The Wild Cry of Love; The Slaves of Love; The Cave of Love; A Game of Love; The Love Pirate; The Love Trap; Conquered by Love; The Prisoner of Love; A Fugitive From Love; The Problems of Love.</p>
        <p>Titles lacking love may need heart:</p>
        <p>The Knave of Hearts; The Queen of Hearts; Women Have Hearts; The Waltz of Hearts; A Duel of Hearts; The Captive Heart; The Smuggled Heart; The Unknown Heart; The Hidden Heart; Call of the Heart, Desire of the Heart; No Heart Is Free; A Sword to the Heart; The Heart of the Clan; A Hazard of Hearts; The Chieftain Without a Heart.</p>
        <p>Some titles promise to unlock the mysteries of marriage and sex roles, not to mention aphrodisiacs:</p>
        <p>Men Are Wonderful; Woman, The Enigma; The Husband Hunters; Living Together; Wanted: A Wedding Ring; The Wild Unwilling Wife; A Very Unusual Wife; Bride to the King; The Incredible Honeymoon; Romantic Royal Marriages; Husbands and Wives; Marriage for the Moderns; Love, Life and Sex; Vitamins for Vitality; The Magic of Honey.</p>
        <p>Astronomical references can give the book a nice, dreamy feel:</p>
        <p>Touch the Stars: A Clue to Happiness; Count the Stars; Seek the Stars; Touch a Star; A Runaway Star; Stars in My Heart; Stars in Her Eyes; Terror in the Sun; Love in the Moon; Light of the Moon; A Shaft of Sunlight, Pure and Untouched; Moon Over Eden; Riding to the Moon; Love in the Clouds.</p>
        <p>A good sense of geography can help locate the characters and orient the reader:</p>
        <p>Paradise in Penang; Heaven in Hong Kong; Alone in Paris; Lovers in Lisbon; Lovers in Paradise; Just Off Piccadilly; To Scotland and Love; An Innocent in Russia; A Ghost in Monte Carlo.</p>
        <p>It's always smart to hint that you've got a secret or two:</p>
        <p>The Youth Secret; Secret Harbor; The Secret Fear; The Secret of the Glen; Secret of the Mosque; Barbara Cartland's Book of Useless Information.</p>
        <p>Book buyers, like everyone else, are fond of the supernatural:</p>
        <p>Enchanted; Lost Enchantment; The Enchanted Moment; The Enchanting Evil; The Enchanted Waltz; Winged Magic; The Magic of Love; Bewitched; Gift of the Gods; The Gods Forget; Flowers for the God of Love; A Witch's Spell; Love Strikes a Devil; The Kiss of the Devil; Stolen Halo; A Halo for the Devil.</p>
        <p>When in doubt, use alliteration:</p>
        <p>Temptation for a Teacher; The Temptation of Torilla; Love, Lords and Lady-Birds; Look Lovely, Be Lovely; The Golden Gondola; A Duel of Jewels; A Kiss for the King; Fascinating Forties: A Book for the Over-Forties; Broken Barriers; Desperate Defiance; The Power and the Prince; Dollars for the Duke; The Duchess Disappeared; A Duel With Destiny; Drena and the Duke, Walking to Wonderland; A Serpent of Satan.</p>
        <p>Finally, a sexy title can pose a pressing question:</p>
        <p>For What?; First Class, Lady?; Magic or Mirage?; Who Can Deny Love?</p>
        <p>. . . Who, indeed?</p>
