        <p>ONCE private art collectors decide to donate the fruits of their passion to the public, they frequently discover it is not easy. What public? What building? What city? Naturally, they want to be wooed as evidence of their prestige as collectors, but they often also impose conditions: that their collection remain intact and carry their name; that it be well housed in a city of art lovers. All of which explains why philanthropy can be trying -- and why Sir Arthur Gilbert, a British-born art collector long resident in Los Angeles, could not be happier.</p>
        <p>Last week, the Gilbert Collection, comprising some 850 works of decorative art, opened to the public in an elegant late-18th-century palace on the banks of the Thames in central London. Eager to obtain the collection, the British Government offered Sir Arthur this prime real estate, while profits from a new national lottery paid for the building's initial $30 million refurbishment. Further, its palace home, known as Somerset House, is being turned into a cultural center, almost insuring that the collection will not go unnoticed in this museum-rich city.</p>
        <p>In fact, another stage of this ambitious $75 million remake was also completed last week. The neo-Classical building's vast courtyard, now cleaned, repaired and cleared of parked cars, is ready to be used for concerts, while open-air cafes on its riverside terrace will soon be joined by a permanent display of sculptures. The next stage involves the palace's South Building: beginning this fall, it will offer a permanent exhibition space to the State Hermitage Museum of St. Petersburg; and within two years, it will show the Courtauld Gallery's splendid Impressionist collection.</p>
        <p>For the moment, though, the Gilbert Collection is the star, occupying the long galleries that run beneath the river terrace as well as a small section of the South Building. Designed by the British architects Peter Inskip and Peter Jenkins, the restoration has included rescuing the King's Barge House, which is now below ground level but which gave direct access to the Thames until the Embankment was built in the 1850's. The galleries themselves, tall enough to accommodate a mezzanine, make generous use of steel, glass and wood to create a feeling of space that works well for the many small objects on display.</p>
        <p>What visitors see, on the other hand, really makes sense only as a personal collection. Its principal components -- 275 silver objects, 220 gold snuff boxes, 260 mosaics and 80 enameled portrait miniatures -- are each significant in their own field, but the collection's coherence is ultimately that of a single man's taste. And lest this be forgotten, the entire contents of this collector's Los Angeles office have been installed in a room in the museum, complete with a wax figure of Sir Arthur, nattily dressed in tennis shirt and shorts, talking forever on the telephone.</p>
        <p>This bizarre touch tells part of his story, of course. Born in 1913 of Polish Jewish immigrant parents, Sir Arthur and his wife, Rosalinde, a designer, fled the dour grayness of postwar London for the sun of California in 1949. They had already made their first fortune in the evening gown business and, in Los Angeles, Sir Arthur promptly made a second fortune as a real estate developer. But he later explained, ''To me, making money just for the sake of making money doesn't make any sense.'' So, along with philanthropic work in the United States and Israel, he began collecting art, at first almost accidentally, then with increasing focus and dedication.</p>
        <p>Indeed, two ''paintings'' in his collection led him down an unexpected path because they were not in fact paintings but micromosaics, a term he later coined to describe mosaics that use threads of glass to create an impression of a painting.</p>
        <p>The Gilbert Collection, which includes scores of micromosaics, has had the wisdom of lending each visitor a large magnifying glass. Indeed, without it, much of the pleasure of viewing the collection would be lost because not only the micromosaics, but also many other objects, are either very small or show their craftsmanship in tiny detail. This is the case with another kind of mosaic on display here. Known as Florentine hard stones (or pietre dure), these use shards of marble and semiprecious stones to create colorful images that may equally decorate furniture (like the 17th-century cabinet made in Prague for Emperor Rudolph II, one of the collection's prize pieces), clocks or jewelry.</p>
        <p>A magnifying glass is also definitely needed to appreciate the 200 or so gold snuff boxes, most of them from 18th-century Paris, London, Berlin and St. Petersburg. Little larger than the palm of a hand, they are variously decorated -- inside and out -- with precious stones and miniature paintings. Six on display here belonged to Frederick the Great of Prussia, who is said to have owned some 300 gold snuff boxes. While taking snuff was a common social ritual in European salons, these boxes were made for display or as gifts. One shows a miniature of Napoleon in his coronation robes above the initial ''N,'' supposedly a gift by the French emperor to a Polish aristocrat.</p>
        <p>THERE is more gold -- this time solid gold -- in another part of the collection where a well-guarded room is devoted to 30 objects from all periods and all climes, ranging from a delicate Anatolian ewer some 4,500 years old to a gold and enamel chalice decorated with pearls and diamonds made in the 19th century, probably by the French craftsman Lucien Falize.</p>
        <p>The silver collection is in a sense even more impressive, not least because it opens with two large Royal Gates presented by Catherine the Great to a monastery near Kiev in the late 18th century (they are called ''royal'' because Christ, the King of Heaven, passes through them in the form of the eucharist). Standing more than seven feet high, they were sold by the Soviet Union to William Randolph Hearst in the 1930's and are believed to be unique outside the former Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>The rest of Sir Arthur's silver and silver-gilt collection, spanning the 15th to the 19th centuries, reflects the extraordinary exhibitionism of Europe's royal palaces and aristocratic homes. Whether tankards or dishes, candelabras or cups, they are invariably highly ornate, often decorated with mythological figures, coats of arms or hunting scenes. Sir Arthur acquired particularly good examples of work by two London goldsmiths, the 18th-century French immigrant Paul de Lamerie and the early-19th-century artist Paul Storr. But if ever there were doubts about the eclecticism of this collection, it also presents a silver and silver-gilt howdah, or elephant saddle, made in India in the late 19th century.</p>
        <p>Indeed, one of the problems evidently faced by Timothy Schroder, the keeper of the collection, and his assistant, Rachel Layton, is how to display works that do not always form part of a visual narrative. Another problem has been posed by Sir Arthur's requirement that every item in the collection be on view all the time: as a collector, he may have loved them all equally, but they are not all of the same quality. And yet these shortcomings are more than compensated for by the friendly and instructive presentation of the objects.</p>
        <p>Still, in its hope of awakening new public interest in these genres of decorative art, the Gilbert Collection's strongest card may well be its location. Built on the site of medieval episcopal houses and a later Renaissance palace, Somerset House, across the Thames from the Royal National Theater, has long been a household name in England as the repository of the land's birth and death records. These have now been removed and, while the East and West Buildings are still occupied by the country's tax authorities, the rebirth of the palace as a cultural complex is bound to draw visitors to the Gilbert Collection, above all when a few steps away they can also find the Hermitage Museum's rooms and the Courtauld Gallery. Sir Arthur can rest assured that his name will not be forgotten.</p>
