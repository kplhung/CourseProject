        <p>Elizabeth Winthrop</p>
        <p>A video documentary entitled ''Elizabeth Winthrop: All the Days of Her Life'' will have its premiere in Greenwich, where she lived in the 17th century. The documentary will be shown at the Perrot Memorial Library on Thursday at 7:30 p.m., and at the Greenwich Historical Society on Friday at 12:30 and 4 p.m.</p>
        <p>Joni Steele Kimberlin made the video after reading Anya Seton's 1958 novel ''The Winthrop Woman.'' Elizabeth Winthrop, described as a rebel at heart, left England and went to Massachusetts in 1631, where her uncle, John Winthrop, was governor. But she picked up and left to escape the Puritan grip on her life and that of the community. Settling in Greenwich with her family (her married name was Feake), she bought land and is said to have lived as a free-thinking woman.</p>

        <p>Elizabeth Winthrop</p>
        <p>A video documentary entitled ''Elizabeth Winthrop: All the Days of Her Life'' will have its premiere in Greenwich, where she lived in the 17th century. The documentary will be shown at the Perrot Memorial Library on Thursday at 7:30 p.m., and at the Greenwich Historical Society on Friday at 12:30 and 4 p.m.</p>
        <p>Joni Steele Kimberlin made the video after reading Anya Seton's 1958 novel ''The Winthrop Woman.'' Elizabeth Winthrop, described as a rebel at heart, left England and went to Massachusetts in 1631, where her uncle, John Winthrop, was governor. But she picked up and left to escape the Puritan grip on her life and that of the community. Settling in Greenwich with her family (her married name was Feake), she bought land and is said to have lived as a free-thinking woman.</p>
        <p>The video may be seen on public television at 10 p.m. on June 14, and on the morning of June 17. In the meantime, the program at the Perrot Library, including a talk by Ms. Kimberlin, is free. Tickets to the 12:30 screening and lunch at the Historical Society, and the 4 p.m. screening and tea are $22. Call (203) 879-6899, extension 10 for reservations or more information.</p>
        <p>Ralf Feyl</p>
        <p>Ralf Feyl, still in his 20's, has been quite successful in showing his paintings exclusively through the Cooley Gallery in Old Lyme. Until now his work has been focused on landscapes, but his new show, running through June 10 and called ''Within,'' is devoted to interiors, with nary a human being in sight.</p>
        <p>Mr. Feyl studied at the American Academy of Art in Chicago and at the Lyme Academy of Fine Art. Now he lives in Maine where he paints its seacoast.</p>
        <p>His exhibition will run through June 10. Viewing hours are Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The Cooley Gallery is at 25 Lyme Street and the number for more information is (860) 434-8807.</p>
        <p>Show House in Westport</p>
        <p>One of the stately homes of Westport has been given the full treatment as this year's Designer Show House, presented by the Westport Historical Society. Staffordshire Hall, at 5 Northside Lane, will open to the public on Thursday and remain on view through June 25.</p>
        <p>Seventeen interior designers, three decorative painters and three landscape designers have worked on the mansion's 10 rooms, includimg a large reception room, library, sitting room, dining room, kitchen and butler's pantry, five bedrooms, four baths and a powder room, two outdoor terraces, and a circular driveway with a fountain.</p>
        <p>Admission to a preview cocktail party on Wednesday from 6 to 8 p.m., followed by a Great Gatsby gala at the Inn at Longshore from 8 to midnight, will cost $200. Tickets to the cocktail party alone are $100. Other special events are lectures on June 4, by Mario Buatta, June 8 by Scott Salvator and June 15 by Linda Banks.</p>
        <p>Admission to the show on Thursdays through Sundays from 11 to 5 will be $20 at the door, or call (203) 222-8016 for reservations or more information.</p>
        <p>Brass Ensemble</p>
        <p>The Gabrieli Brass will be the featured performers in a Memorial Day concert today at 6 p.m. at Christ Church in Greenwich. The ensemble will be accompanied by the church's music director, the organist Robert Tate, and by Robert Ainsley, an organ scholar.</p>
        <p>The program ranges from works by Telemann to Scott Joplin, from Louis Vierne to John Philip Sousa, and in between, ''Prayer for a Dead Soldier'' by the Czech composer Dalibore Vackar.</p>
        <p>Tickets are $15 for general admission, $25 for reserved seats, and $10 for students and people over 64. The church address is 254 East Putnam Avenue (Route 1). Call (203) 869-0855 for more information of reservations.</p>
        <p>Spectacular Nature</p>
        <p>One doesn't think of Meriden as a place where continents collided 250 million years ago, or as a place where within the town's 1,800-acre Hubbard Park more than 1,000 species of animals and plants thrive among 200-million-year-old traprock ridges.</p>
        <p>Each year the scientists at the University of Connecticut hold what they call a BioBlitz in one of the state's parks to introduce people to Mother Nature. On Saturday, from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., people are invited to enjoy the sights and sounds of Hubbard Park free of charge.</p>
        <p>While the park protects many of the species that inhabit it, visitors will find some of them in their own backyards and neighborhoods when they return home with a better understanding of what to look for -- and how to deal with what they find.</p>
        <p>An integral part of the BioBlitz is that 100 UConn scientists will spend 24 hours trying to identify as many species of plants, animals, fish, reptiles, amphibians and insects as they can.</p>
        <p>To reach Hubbard Park, take Exit 4 from Interstate 691 and turn toward Meriden; once in the city go to the park entrance on South Main Street. The number to call for more information is (860) 486-4460.</p>
        <p>Movie Fest</p>
        <p>The 13th Annual Connecticut Gay and Lesbian Film Festival opens on Friday at the Cinestudio of Trinity College, 300 Summit Street in Hartford; it continues through June 10. A new series called ''Reel Stories'' celebrates the accomplishments of individuals who have contributed to the gay and lesbian community.</p>
        <p>Combinations of short films and features made in the United States, Sweden, Germany, France, Canada and Australia will be shown daily at 7:30 p.m., with matinees on Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m. Tickets are $8 a show, $20 for a three-day pass and $60 for the full festival.</p>
        <p>For a complete schedule, directions or more information call (860) 297-2463.</p>
        <p>Birds' Eggs</p>
        <p>''Your assistance is needed,'' say two plaques at the Audubon Coastal Center beach in Milford, ''in protecting piping plovers and least terns from disturbance and predation while they nest and raise their young at Connecticut's shoreline beaches.''</p>
        <p>The plaques go on to describe the cream-colored, brown-flecked eggs that piping plovers lay in late March, and the tiny least tern's long pointed wings and forked tail.</p>
        <p>On Saturday at 11 a.m., the center will conduct a program on the two threatened birds, coordinated by the Federal Fish and Wildlife agency's plover monitoring program. Adults and children are invited to hear how they can help in preserving the species, threatened as they are by dog walkers, cats, beachcombers, and wildlife attracted to food scraps left behind by picnickers.</p>
        <p>The center is at 1 Milford Point Road. The number to call for for free reservations or more information is (203) 878-7440.</p>
