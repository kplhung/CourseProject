        <p>OVER the years, investors in technology stocks have become accustomed to coping with mini-bear markets in the sector once or maybe twice a year. But the bear they are looking at right now is no koala.</p>
        <p>Through Friday, the Nasdaq composite index had declined 21.2 percent this year, and more than 36 percent from its peak on March 10. Even so, some Internet stocks still trade at triple-digit multiples. And even with the fall, the Nasdaq index is still nearly 30 percent higher than it was at the start of the 1999 Memorial Day weekend.</p>

        <p>OVER the years, investors in technology stocks have become accustomed to coping with mini-bear markets in the sector once or maybe twice a year. But the bear they are looking at right now is no koala.</p>
        <p>Through Friday, the Nasdaq composite index had declined 21.2 percent this year, and more than 36 percent from its peak on March 10. Even so, some Internet stocks still trade at triple-digit multiples. And even with the fall, the Nasdaq index is still nearly 30 percent higher than it was at the start of the 1999 Memorial Day weekend.</p>
        <p>With the Federal Reserve raising rates, there is every chance that the selling will continue. But the fundamentals remain excellent, and earnings are strong. Which makes you wonder if the worst isn't over.</p>
        <p>Ron Berry, co-portfolio manager of the RS Information Age Fund, took some time last week to talk about technology and timing. Here are excerpts from the conversation:</p>
        <p>Q. In the last three months of last year and the first three months of 2000, a lot of folks were screaming about insane technology valuations. Did you hear those screams?</p>
        <p>A.  Up until the first quarter, we had been pretty much fully invested. But in early March we became uncomfortable with valuations. At that point we raised our cash position to 20 percent, which is a lot for this fund. . . We started to get back into the sector in early to mid-April. At that point we felt overall valuations were attractive.</p>
        <p>Q. Is the worst of the selling over?</p>
        <p>A.  I don't think the true buyers are back in the market, but I do believe most of the damage has been done. That doesn't mean things won't be pretty volatile for a while.</p>
        <p>Over the next few weeks, investors will be focusing on economic news more than on the fundamentals of these companies. If you understand the fundamentals of the companies, and they are strong, you could find some good entry points into a lot of these stocks.</p>
        <p>Q. So what have you been buying?</p>
        <p>A.  Semiconductor stocks are far and away the best value in technology right now, and currently represent about 35 percent of the fund's $320 million portfolio.</p>
        <p>They were the best performers in the first quarter, rising 68 percent. But from the end of March through May 24, the group fell 22 percent. This is despite rising earnings estimates and a huge supply shortage. . . Our largest semiconductor holdings are Xilinx, Terradyne, Intel and Applied Materials.</p>
        <p>Q. Those are all big companies. Why is that?</p>
        <p>A.  We have tightened the fund up into the dominant, more liquid names. As the recovery expands, we will move down in market capitalization to pick up some bargains.</p>
        <p>To illustrate the point, at the end of the first quarter, the median market cap for the stocks in our fund was $49 billion. At the end of last year it was $21 billion.</p>
        <p>Q. Has that strategy paid off?</p>
        <p>A. Through Thursday, the fund is down 7.5 percent, so we are beating the Nasdaq. We have outperformed largely due to the semiconductor weighting and the fact we have been in larger cap names.</p>
        <p>Q. Which other sectors do you favor?</p>
        <p>A.  We are overweight in communications equipment stocks. Those represent about one-third of the fund's assets. Our holdings include JDS Uniphase and Corning, wireless companies like Nokia, Motorola and Ericsson and traditional equipment providers like Telabs, Lucent and Nortel.</p>
        <p>Q. You said that earlier this year you were leery of Internet stocks. Are you still?</p>
        <p>A.  In general, yes. But over the last week we have been buying some Internet companies, like BroadVision. They are seeing a lot of demand from bricks-and-mortar companies who are concerned they are missing the opportunity to build on the Internet. We also recently bought some Ariba, the business-to-business software company. And we own some America Online as well.</p>
        <p>We don't own any Yahoo right now, but I am doing a lot of work on it. As we get back into the Internet sector, it will probably be a name we add sooner rather than later. But at more than 225 times next year's earnings, Yahoo is pretty pricey.</p>
        <p>Q. What advice do you give someone who is just beginning to invest in technology stocks?</p>
        <p>A. For someone starting off, we recommend investing in the gorillas in each area, the Intels, Microsofts, Nokias, Ciscos and EMCs of the world. Seek out the core names, because the fundamentals look great.</p>
        <p>One statistic we always throw out is that the United States only has 5 percent of the world's population but accounts for roughly 45 percent of all technology spending. About 88 percent of the world's population is in countries that have not been significant spenders on technology. That is changing.</p>
