        <p>The Stone Pony in Asbury Park is riding again this weekend with some of the same bands that helped make it famous in the world of rock 'n' roll before it closed in September 1998 with a weekend of nostalgia-laced concerts billed, at the time, as ''The Pony's Last Ride.''</p>
        <p>The club owner, Domenic Santana, who took a rundown club in Jersey City and turned it into the successful Hard Grove Cafi, may have had a falling out with his Stone Pony partner and with local band bookers, but he has plunged ahead with a weekend full of activities to reopen the famous rock site.</p>

        <p>The Stone Pony in Asbury Park is riding again this weekend with some of the same bands that helped make it famous in the world of rock 'n' roll before it closed in September 1998 with a weekend of nostalgia-laced concerts billed, at the time, as ''The Pony's Last Ride.''</p>
        <p>The club owner, Domenic Santana, who took a rundown club in Jersey City and turned it into the successful Hard Grove Cafi, may have had a falling out with his Stone Pony partner and with local band bookers, but he has plunged ahead with a weekend full of activities to reopen the famous rock site.</p>
        <p>The club has long been the center of the shore rock scene and, to a large extent, for the entire state, having served as the springboard for Bruce Springsteen, Bon Jovi, Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes, and more talented local and regional bands than can you can shake a drum stick at.</p>
        <p>Bands have been scheduled throughout June, including a return of Cats on a Smooth Surface in their traditional Sunday night time slot.</p>
