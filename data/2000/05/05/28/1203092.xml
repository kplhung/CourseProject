      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says post-Watergate campaign finance system has collapsed for several reasons: Atty Gen Janet Reno's political timidity and failure of her Justice Dept to investigate fund-raising abuses, unwillingness of Republican leadership in Senate, notably Trent Lott, to allow fair vote on McCain-Feingold ban on soft money, and spinelessness of Federal Election Commission</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Last Wednesday, at the MCI Sports Center in Washington, the Democratic Party raised an astonishing $26.5 million at a dinner headlined by President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore and attended by about 12,000 loyal Democrats, some paying a half-million dollars for the privilege. This staggering sum surpassed what until then had been the  record, the $21.3 million raised less than a month before by the Republicans and George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>The occasion cemented Mr. Clinton's legacy as the most persuasive and productive fund-raiser in American political history. Joe Lockhart, his press secretary, suggested that his boss might end up raising a cool billion before he is through. But it also dramatized something less deserving of awe, namely the complete domination of the campaign environment by soft money.</p>

        <p>Last Wednesday, at the MCI Sports Center in Washington, the Democratic Party raised an astonishing $26.5 million at a dinner headlined by President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore and attended by about 12,000 loyal Democrats, some paying a half-million dollars for the privilege. This staggering sum surpassed what until then had been the  record, the $21.3 million raised less than a month before by the Republicans and George W. Bush.</p>
        <p>The occasion cemented Mr. Clinton's legacy as the most persuasive and productive fund-raiser in American political history. Joe Lockhart, his press secretary, suggested that his boss might end up raising a cool billion before he is through. But it also dramatized something less deserving of awe, namely the complete domination of the campaign environment by soft money.</p>
        <p>At one time or another, Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore have decried soft money. Even so, the soft money race proceeds at a torrid clip, without shame or remorse in either political party. As of last week, the two parties had raised at least $200 million in soft money, a record for this point in the election cycle, and they are well on their way to doubling the $260 million in soft money raised in 1996. Meanwhile, individual contributions are reaching nosebleed altitudes when some dinner guests fork over $500,000.</p>
        <p>Soft money has been making a mockery of the post-Watergate campaign finance laws ever since the parties began exploiting a loophole that permitted unlimited contributions to the political parties rather than individual candidates. But the new numbers are so outlandish that they numb the mind and threaten to dull the capacity for outrage. Yet this is the very same money that has purchased not only overnight stays in the Lincoln bedroom, but access to the Congressional offices where legislation affecting millions of people is written. The main difference now is that there is more of it.</p>
        <p>The collapse of the post-Watergate system has come about for several reasons. One is Janet Reno's political timidity and the failure of her Justice Department to investigate the fund-raising abuses of 1996 -- the illegal foreign money, the Lincoln bedroom money and all the rest of it. Another is the unwillingness of the Republican leadership in the Senate, notably Trent Lott, to allow a fair up-or-down vote on the broad ban on soft money sponsored by Senators John McCain and Russell Feingold. But why should he? A system that allows Mr. Lott and Republican big shots in the House like Tom DeLay to shake down contributors in exchange for influence rewards them every bit as much as it rewards the administration.</p>
        <p>A third reason is the spinelessness of the Federal Election Commission, the government's main enforcement agency. The commission has been as ineffectual as Ms. Reno in investigating abuses and imposing restraints on the parties. But Mr. Lott and others, with Bill Clinton's acquiescence, are determined to make it weaker still. Last week, the Senate confirmed a Republican named Bradley Smith for a seat on the commission despite Mr. Smith's sworn opposition to the very campaign finance laws he is supposed to enforce.</p>
        <p>His approval was part of a deal in which the Republicans agreed to unblock 16 of Mr. Clinton's judicial nominations. So just when the fund-raising system is spinning wildly out of control, the country is treated to a bipartisan sellout of the agency that is obliged under the law to regulate it.</p>
        <p>The polls say that the public wants reform, and in recent months dozens of corporations have decided to boycott what they see as little more than a shakedown operation. But for the most part the political leadership seems tone deaf. Mr. Bush would preserve the soft money loophole. At the Democratic gala, Mr. Gore said that the next dinner four years from now would not cost nearly as much because as president he would bring ''meaningful'' change. But neither he nor Mr. Clinton seemed the least bit embarrassed about dipping into the trough one more time.</p>
