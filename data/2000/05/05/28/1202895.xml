        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>David Thomson has it right [''Giving Children the 50's as an Antidote to the 90's,'' May 21]. Junk in, junk out. Parents who wish their child to know that there are higher levels of entertainment than the sights and sounds of electric shocks to the genitals (Disney's most recent ''101 Dalmatians'') and frying pans to the face (''Home Alone II'' et al.) may turn to the classics, which are widely available on videotape. The lesson in this house is that once you get past a few objections (''What is this movie?''  ''Where did you get this?''  ''The black and white hurts my eyes'') the classics can captivate. Our daughter, now 13, thoroughly enjoyed ''The Searchers'' and was all wrapped up in ''The Lady Vanishes'' at age 10 (though I have to admit that the possibility of ''Psycho'' has not yet occurred to us). Note to Parents: take control.</p>
