        <p>Tishman Speyer Propeties' acquisition of 666 Fifth Avenue is a return home of sorts for executives at company, since the building was known as Tishman Building when it was built by Tishman Realty &amp; Construction in 1958; Tishman companies are separate, privately owned companies created with the breakup of the publicly traded company in 1976; photo (M)</p>

        <p>WHEN Tishman Speyer Properties and an investment group recently bought 666 Fifth Avenue, the 39-story, 1.3-million-square-foot building at 52nd Street, it was more than just an investment. For some Tishman Speyer executives, it was a return home and the latest episode in a multigenerational family history.</p>
        <p>The building, which was completed in 1958, was developed by Tishman Realty &amp; Construction and was then known as the Tishman Building. It is still the home of Tishman Realty &amp; Construction, but despite the name, it is not the same company that built the property.</p>
        <p>This confusing jumble of names is the result of the breakup in 1976 of a publicly traded company and the formation of three private companies, each headed by a member of the Tishman family, whose roots in New York real estate go back to the 19th century.</p>
        <p>Jerry I. Speyer, the president of Tishman Speyer Properties, said that when he began his career with the Tishmans in 1966, it was in offices at 666 Fifth. ''When it came to our attention that the building was available for sale, we already knew a lot about it,'' he said. ''There is a lot of institutional memory about it.''</p>
        <p>As Steven R. Wechsler, who is now a senior managing director of Tishman Speyer Properties, recalled, ''I started with the company in 1972, and I did my first deals in that building.'' Back in the 70's, he said,  rents in the building were in the range of $4 a square foot annually. Now the average is close to $40 a square foot, and at that level, below the market.</p>
        <p>''That is one reason the building was attractive to us,'' Mr. Speyer said. ''The space is way under the market.'' According to a report published by Insignia/ESG, the  brokerage and real estate services company, asking rents for buildings in 666 Fifth's  neighborhood were averaging $57.48 a square foot as recently as April 1.</p>
        <p>Tishman Speyer Properties, either by itself or jointly with others, is an owner and manager of such New York trophies as Rockefeller Center and the Chrysler Building.</p>
        <p>The company controls an international portfolio of properties totaling 36.4 million square feet and valued at $10 billion, a spokesman said.</p>
        <p>(Rockefeller Center has been placed up for sale or recapitalization so that the investors who bought it in a bankruptcy sale in 1996 can take advantage of the stronger market and the improvements made in the meantime. The Chrysler Building is also up for recapitalization, although Tishman Speyer is expected to retain ownership.)</p>
        <p>The chairman of the Tishman Speyer is Robert V. Tishman, a principal in the old Tishman Realty &amp; Construction company and Mr. Speyer's former father-in-law.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tishman's cousin John Tishman is the chairman of the current Tishman Realty &amp; Construction, which is a construction manager that invests for its own portfolio as well. The construction company recently completed 4 Times Square, the 1.6-million-square-foot Conde Nast Building at Broadway and 42nd Street, and is constructing another office building nearby, at 42nd Street and Seventh Avenue, that will be the North American headquarters of Reuters, the news and financial information agency.</p>
        <p>Those projects were built for clients, 4 Times Square for the Durst organization and Reuters for Rudin.</p>
        <p>But at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue, the company has built E-Walk for its own account. The building is an entertainment and retail center with movie theaters and stores. And the company is planning to build an 860-room hotel, which is will be managed by Weston, on Eighth Avenue between E-Walk  43rd Street.</p>
        <p>E-Walk and the hotel have a price tag of $300 million, and a company official said the total value of the hotels and retail properties the company owns is about $2 billion.</p>
        <p>A third company, Tishman Management &amp; Leasing, is owned by Alan V. Tishman, Robert's brother.</p>
        <p>THE various Tishman companies trace their lineage to Julius Tishman, who took the profits from a department store in Newburgh, N.Y., and built a six-story tenement on the Lower East Side in 1898. Julius Tishman &amp; Sons was privately held until it sold stock to the public in 1928, becoming Tishman Realty &amp; Construction.</p>
        <p>Being a publicly traded corporation was difficult for a real estate company, because the accounting formula that determines earnings per share was developed for manufacturing companies. Although the company usually produced a lot of cash and the value of its properties increased, the accounting rules regarding depreciation and other noncash charges depressed its reported earnings per share and its stock price.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, in the mid-1950's, David Tishman, Robert and Alan's father and  John's uncle, decided to build an office building with the family name on it. He assembled a block on Fifth Avenue between 52nd and 53rd Streets. To spread the risk, he formed an alliance with the Crown family of Chicago and started to build 666 Fifth Avenue. (In a footnote, Mr. Speyer said the Crowns were part of the group that recently repurchased the building.)</p>
        <p>In the early 1970's, as New York City was heading toward a financial crisis, Tishman Realty &amp; Construction assembled a block on the Avenue of the Americas between 45th and 45th Streets. With a letter of intent in hand from a large corporation to lease a third of the 1.5-million-square-foot building,  now known as 1166 Avenue of the Americas, construction commenced.</p>
        <p>But the letter of intent never actually translated into a lease, and the prospective tenant left town with the building half-built.  Since an unfinished building is completely useless, Tishman continued with the project,  despite the lack of tenants, and the $100 million project produced large losses.</p>
        <p>Those losses forced the company to stop paying dividends in 1974 and later, to abandon the project, losing an equity investment of $30 million. With the city's prospects bleak and corporations leaving the city for suburban locations, the company's financial outlook was poor.</p>
        <p>There were also family tensions as well. According to contemporary and subsequent accounts, John Tishman, who was running the construction part of the business, wanted more autonomy. And Mr. Speyer, who at the time was Robert Tishman's son-in-law,  was working in development and wanted  more freedom for deal making.</p>
        <p>So a decision was made to liquidate the company, selling its properties, including 666 Fifth Avenue, to pay shareholders -- the Tishman family being the largest -- a final dividend.</p>
        <p>Since the insurance companies that were interested in buying the properties were not interested in a construction company, that part of the business was broken off and sold to the organization that was then operating  Rockefeller Center. John Tishman retained the rights to the company name and its steel-beam ''T'' logo.</p>
        <p>John Tishman was later able to buy the construction company back from Rockefeller Center, and it remains privately owned today; John Tishman's son, Daniel, is the executive vice president.</p>
        <p>Robert Tishman and Mr. Speyer formed Tishman Speyer Properties as a development company following the breakup and built the portfolio the company now holds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Speyer said he did not plan to do much to 666 Fifth Avenue, other than to improve the visibility of the lobby's centerpiece, a  waterfall sculpture by Isamu Noguchi. The top-floor space once occupied by the Top of the Sixes restaurant is now a private cigar club that has a long-term lease.</p>
        <p>Mr. Speyer brims with optimism about the prospects for real estate in the city, in contrast to the gloomy days of the late 1970's. ''All our properties are fully leased,'' he said. ''If there is any problem in New York, it is that there is no space available.''</p>
        <p>Because of the strength of the market, Mr. Speyer said he was planning to start construction of a speculative office building on what is now a parking lot on a site between 40th and 41st Streets and Second and Third Avenues.</p>
        <p>But he knows that it will not do much to reduce the shortage of Midtown office space. ''The building will be 375,000 square feet,'' he said. ''That's about one-third 666 Fifth Avenue.''</p>
