        <p>In 1938, in the final days of the great era of trade and exploration under sail, an 18-year-old Englishman named Eric Newby signed on as an apprentice seaman aboard the four-masted sailing ship Moshulu, bound from Europe for Australia to take on a cargo of grain.

        <p>In 1938, in the final days of the great era of trade and exploration under sail, an 18-year-old Englishman named Eric Newby signed on as an apprentice seaman aboard the four-masted sailing ship Moshulu, bound from Europe for Australia to take on a cargo of grain. A dozen more ships embarked on the same mission. The first one back to the continent would command top money at market.</p>
        <p>Newby's book, ''The Last Grain Race,'' launched a distinguished career in travel writing. The voyage itself provided Newby with experiences and lessons that he could not have received ashore. ''The work of handling the great acreages of sail was very heavy, even for men and boys with strong constitutions,'' wrote Newby. ''Yet strangely enough, I look back on the time I spent in Moshulu with great pleasure.''</p>
        <p>High-seas commerce is no longer conducted on wind-powered vessels, but the educational and character-building benefits of standing a midnight watch in a rising breeze are as genuine today as they were in Newby's time. In the weeks ahead, thousands of young cadets will begin or continue the adventure of a lifetime as an unprecedented gathering of tall ships set a course for East Coast ports from Miami to Portland, Me.</p>
        <p>The centerpiece of the summerlong series of festivals and celebrations will take place on July 4 in New York Harbor, when upwards of 50,000 spectator boats will gather for OpSail 2000 (www.opsail2000.org), a parade of sail led by the 295-foot United States Coast Guard bark Eagle. President Clinton will also be on hand to oversee an international naval review. Altogether, the fleet will feature more than 150 tall ships and almost three dozen naval warships representing some 50 nations.</p>
        <p>''When all those boats fill up the harbor,'' said OpSail's international director, Alma Viator, ''you'll be able to walk out to the Statue of Liberty.''</p>
        <p>The shoreside traffic will be no less hectic. ''There could be another four to five million people,'' said Greg Perrin, the organization's vice president. ''We don't think that's an exaggeration.''</p>
        <p>Though the six-day New York event -- which will also include a Fourth of July fireworks display that organizers claim will be ''the largest pyrotechnic display in history'' -- is easily the largest tall ships' venue of the season, in lesser numbers the sight of sailors scrambling aloft to set or douse sail will be a recurring one all along the seaboard this summer.</p>
        <p>This weekend, in San Juan, the first of five OpSail assemblages leading up to the New York extravaganza is underway with its own program of music, dancing, ship tours and parties. From there the fleet, growing in size and in momentum as it charges north, will make stops in Miami, Norfolk, Va., Baltimore and Philadelphia. Post-New York calls will be made in New London, Conn., and Portland.</p>
        <p>Operation Sail was founded by President Kennedy in 1961 and has been the impetus for several tall ships' rallies, including the 1992 celebrations in honor of the 500th anniversary of Columbus's epic voyage. The millennium milestone serves as this year's theme.</p>
        <p>The OpSail docket, however, is not the only tall ships celebration on tap for this summer. Organized by the American Sail Training Association, Tall Ships 2000 (www.tallships.sailtraining.org) will combine two transAtlantic races with a dedicated cruise in company -- ports of call include Charleston, S.C., Wilmington, Del., and Newport, R.I. -- before landing at the official host port of Boston in mid-July. From there the tall ships will race to Halifax, Nova Scotia, prior to a final leg to Amsterdam.</p>
        <p>Several vessels will participate in both events. Steve Baker, the race director for Tall Ships 2000, said there is a common denominator to each of the programs. ''Sail training is a youth-oriented event,'' he said, noting that racing rules for tall ships regattas stipulate that at least half the people on each participating vessel be between the ages of 15 and 25.</p>
        <p>Within that vast fleet, however, the individual ships each have their own special character. Several of the Class A behemoths, such as Chile's 372-foot Esmeralda, Spain's 370-foot Juan Sebastian de Elcano, and Japan's 363-foot Kaiwo Maru -- are naval training vessels. Others, like the Mystic Seaport's just-launched 129-foot Amistad, a historical recreation of the slave trader whose story was told in the film of the same name, are school or museum ships on education missions.</p>
        <p>Then there is the 180-foot Lord Nelson from the United Kingdom, a three-master that has been specially laid out and rigged to accommodate a crew consisting of both physically disabled and able-bodied sailors.</p>
        <p>Whatever their background, the tall ships will move forward under the same power of the wind and spirit of adventure. And the cadets who sail upon them, like Eric Newby over 60 years ago, will be forever changed by their travels.</p>
