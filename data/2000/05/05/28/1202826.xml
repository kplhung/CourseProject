        <p>IF I had to pick out one of the many memories John Gielgud has left me, it would be the final moments of the Prospero he played for the National Theater back in 1974. He stepped forward and removed the Elizabethan cap he was wearing, revealing that high forehead, majestic dome and receding hairline. It wasn't just Prospero who was abjuring ''rough magic'' and throwing away a conjuror's staff. It wasn't just Gielgud bringing ''The Tempest'' to a profoundly moving close. No, we in the audience had the spooky feeling that we were seeing Shakespeare himself using his last play to bid farewell to the stage.</p>
        <p>What made the strange spirituality of the moment doubly, trebly remarkable was that Sir John had played Prospero three times before, on each occasion in a strikingly different way: as a young, turbaned Eastern magician in 1930, as a fine but embittered Italian scholar-aristocrat in 1940, and in 1957 as Timon of Athens's first cousin, a half-naked hermit fighting the temptation to take violent revenge on his foes. No wonder his contemporary and friend, Ralph Richardson, described him as ''a Catherine wheel, spinning out a thousand ideas.'' He was a far more restless, versatile and even experimental actor than many people, himself included, managed to acknowledge.</p>

        <p>IF I had to pick out one of the many memories John Gielgud has left me, it would be the final moments of the Prospero he played for the National Theater back in 1974. He stepped forward and removed the Elizabethan cap he was wearing, revealing that high forehead, majestic dome and receding hairline. It wasn't just Prospero who was abjuring ''rough magic'' and throwing away a conjuror's staff. It wasn't just Gielgud bringing ''The Tempest'' to a profoundly moving close. No, we in the audience had the spooky feeling that we were seeing Shakespeare himself using his last play to bid farewell to the stage.</p>
        <p>What made the strange spirituality of the moment doubly, trebly remarkable was that Sir John had played Prospero three times before, on each occasion in a strikingly different way: as a young, turbaned Eastern magician in 1930, as a fine but embittered Italian scholar-aristocrat in 1940, and in 1957 as Timon of Athens's first cousin, a half-naked hermit fighting the temptation to take violent revenge on his foes. No wonder his contemporary and friend, Ralph Richardson, described him as ''a Catherine wheel, spinning out a thousand ideas.'' He was a far more restless, versatile and even experimental actor than many people, himself included, managed to acknowledge.</p>
        <p>Throughout the long, long career that ended with the 96-year-old Gielgud's death last Sunday, a frequent accusation was that he had a noble head and an exquisite voice box but that neither seemed attached to moving parts below. Even his admirers talked of his work in terms of verbal music, Alec Guinness typically describing him as ''a silver trumpet muffled in velvet.'' In 1991 Gielgud himself remarked in his self-deprecating way that from the very start he ''spoke well but rather too well and fell in love with my own voice.''</p>
        <p>He was also apt to quote the critic who said that ''from the waist downwards Gielgud means absolutely nothing: his legs are the most meaningless imaginable.'' His knees, he once remarked, looked as if they had been tied together with ribbon, which made some roles pretty taxing. He was the first to agree that he had been miscast as Shakespeare's roistering Antony and the first to concede that his boldly athletic rival, Laurence Olivier, had been a more effective Romeo: ''I have neither the looks, the dash nor the virility to make a real success of it,'' Gielgud said. ''I love the language and revel in it all too obviously.''</p>
        <p>But any such summing-up is of course inadequate. First, that precise, delicate voice was always more a strength than a limitation. Moreover, it could be argued that in an era when even classical actors have become vocally more slovenly, often wallowing in barely comprehensible emotion, he never forgot that Shakespeare, in particular, was the most adroit and exacting of poets.</p>
        <p>The great exponent of the Method, Lee Strasberg, who might have been expected to have been hostile, once said that ''when Gielgud speaks the verse, I can hear Shakespeare thinking.'' And you only have to think of the Prospero he played in that National Theater ''Tempest'' or later, in Peter Greenaway's film ''Prospero's Books,'' to know what Strasberg meant.</p>
        <p>Second, Gielgud had a far greater talent for imaginative impersonation than was often recognized. Another of my indelible memories is of his Spooner, the opportunist poet in Harold Pinter's 1975 play ''No Man's Land.'' The tumbledown bohemian with the flapping hair, the lizard eyes and the old sandals, who cadged and crept into the house and life of Ralph Richardson's alcoholic Hirst, was meticulously observed and, as Gielgud himself revealed, partly based on the famously grimy W. H. Auden. As he proved in another pairing with Richardson, this time as a woebegone mental patient in David Storey's ''Home,'' Gielgud could think and feel his way into roles contemporary as well as classical -- and into a formidable array of characters.</p>
        <p>He was, for instance, in the vanguard of those who established that supposedly abstruse Russian, Anton Chekhov, on the British stage. Starting in the 1920's with Konstantin in ''The Seagull'' and the student Trofimov in ''The Cherry Orchard'' (''perfection itself,'' according to the day's leading critic, James Agate), he went on to give acclaimed performances of Trigorin, Vershinin and Gayev. Indeed, his acting successes ranged from Sheridan to Wilde, Ibsen to Shaffer, Noel Coward to Edward Albee, Edward Bond and Alan Bennett, for whom he memorably played a hilariously blimpish headmaster in ''Forty Years On.'' Wry humor was yet another of Gielgud's less recognized strengths. Only coarseness and vulgarity were beyond him, as some of his movie roles inadvertently demonstrated.</p>
        <p>But as Agate said in 1934, Gielgud was ''much too fine and romantic an actor to be happy away from rhetoric and robes.'' It is surely for the distinction and, yes, the variety he brought to classical parts that he will be mainly remembered. The Hamlet he played at the age of 26 in 1930 was arguably the most important and influential of the 20th century: neurotic, vulnerable, self-lacerating and even shrill, as well as sweet and sad. ''I never hoped to see Hamlet played as in one's dreams,'' declared Sybil Thorndike. Others, too, felt that Gielgud's elegant but damaged prince expressed the intricate emotions of a deeply troubled era.</p>
        <p>And so his career continued into the 1940's, 1950's and beyond, perpetuating and refreshing a tradition of classical acting that had begun with Richard Burbage more than three centuries before: Richard II and Shylock and Macbeth, a wonderfully witty Benedick that entranced New York as well as London, an icily puritan Angelo in ''Measure for Measure,'' a Cassius in 1950 that left one critic talking of ''a new, magnificently forceful Gielgud,'' an even more fiery Leontes for Peter Brook in 1951, and a Lear who not only raged to savagely ironic effect but ended by attaining what The Times of London called ''a stillness of beauty which is rarely achieved on the stage.''</p>
        <p>And there, perhaps, was the essence of Gielgud's magic. He displayed range and flexibility, yes, but behind it all he had a simplicity. His often-stated belief was that the actor's duty was not to over-elaborate or over-complicate, not to draw unnecessary attention to himself or his art, but to express an author's intentions as purely as possible. As he might have added, it was unpretentiously and unfussily to find his way to the very core of a play and a part. After all, what linked his Prospero and his incalculably different Spooner? The glimpse it offered of the human soul, that's what.</p>
