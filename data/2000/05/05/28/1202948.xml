        <p>Never has the state taken so firm a hand with an errant city. Last week, the Whitman administration dispatched yet more expertise to Camden, introducing a local-government expert from Cleveland as the newest member of the team settling in here to take control of the city's troubled finances.</p>
        <p>After two years of limited fiscal oversight, the Local Finance Board in Trenton voted on May 10 to impose the highest level of supervision allowed by law. In the event that that is not enough, administration officials said last week that they want legislation enacted this summer to allow a full state takeover.</p>
        <p>''I am afraid that without that authority in our hip pocket, we won't get the kind of cooperation we need out of some of the local officials,'' Govewrnor Whitman said on Friday. In the meantime, at a news conference  Tuesday to introduce Prof. Sylvester Murray of Cleveland State University, the Commissioner of Community Affairs, Jane M. Kenny, promised ''to get to the heart of where the issues and problems are.''</p>
        <p>But while television lights still hovered over Mr. Murray, city officials wondered aloud whether he knew what he was walking into or whether efficiency and integrity could change the reality of a city depleted of both resources and spirit.</p>
        <p>Camden's city government had already been stripped of many functions: the state took over the parking authority in 1994 and put the police under the county prosecutor's supervision in 1998. The housing authority is under federal control. And a state-appointed task force has been overseeing the school board because of low test scores.</p>
        <p>The pressure for a fiscal takeover notched up when Mayor Milton Milan, who had resisted the review board, was indicted March 31 on federal corruption charges.</p>
        <p>''You can lower the deficit, which is treating the symptoms, but at some point you've got to treat the disease, and that's macroeconomic,'' the city clerk, Luis Pastoriza, said. 'Eighty percent of the people in Camden are on some form of government assistance. These people have got to be realistic.''</p>
        <p>Emphasizing that point, Angel Fuentes, vice president of the City Council, walked out before the news conference ended. ''I left in frustration,''' Mr. Fuentes said later.</p>
        <p>Like many here, Mr. Fuentes said the review board that has monitored Camden's finances since 1998 had been a failure. ''People say, 'Look how those incompetent public officials waste taxpayers' money,' '' he said. ''We want to tell them we're struggling.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fuentes tried to make the point to the review board, which held meetings here. He has kept the big color photographs -- a gallery of crumbling brick -- he had once presented to the board. ''I told them, 'None of you live here. None of you would have your children play on these streets.' ''</p>
        <p>Professor Murray, a former city manager in Cincinnati and San Diego, does plan to live here, at least through the summer. Although he had never been in Camden before last week, he said: ''I don't know that the city is lost, is dead. I believe in cities, I believe in people. I believe in communities.''</p>
        <p>A board member of the National Academy of Public Administration, an organization chartered by Congress, he will be working with its president, Robert J. O'Neill Jr., under a contract authorizing fees up to $500,000. For its part, the academy will advise the Local Finance Board, which has set up its operation in City Hall.</p>
        <p>For now, the team is deciphering the city's books and management systems, which local officials concede are in disarray. While the state has the authority to replace department heads, Ms. Kenny said there were no plans ''right now'' to do so.</p>
        <p>Still, the Local Finance Board chairman, Ulrich Steinberg, must approve any expenditure of more than $4,500, meaning that the city cannot install a traffic light or replace a police car without permission.</p>
        <p>With such tight reins has come some chafing. Yet the ill will between city and state appears to be receding. After a meeting with Mayor Milan two weeks ago, Mr. Steinberg described it as ''very positive.''</p>
        <p>But local officials continue to plead for attention to the still-bleeding tax base, which urban experts acknowledge cannot possibly support Camden. Already the city, New Jersey's poorest, receives 70 percent of its revenue from the state, up from 57 percent three years ago.</p>
        <p>Howard Gillette Jr., a history professor at Rutgers's Camden campus who is writing a book on the city, said reliance on local property taxes -- which account for only 20 percent to 25 percent of Camden's revenue -- was starving the city.</p>
        <p>Nor is the state likely to commit the kind of money needed ''to get Camden back into the economic mainstream,'' Professor Gillette said.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey L. Nash, the Camden County freeholder director, said, ''We've been trying to convince the state for years to take a more active role.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nash and state legislators from the area, all Democrats, have pushed for a recovery plan enlisting experts from Rutgers to rebuild Camden's crumbling infrastructure.</p>
        <p>''The administration doesn't want to have to answer to the 85,000 residents as to why there is not enough police protection, why the streets are not being cleaned, why not enough houses are being renovated,'' Mr. Nash said. ''The state of New Jersey has that responsibility but does not want to invest those dollars in Camden.''</p>
        <p>Gwendolyn A. Faison, the City Council president, said she and other city officials had no idea what the state's intentions were. While welcoming Mr. Murray at the news conference, Ms. Faison directed a faint scolding at the officials from Trenton for giving her short notice of the appointment.</p>
        <p>''This is my city,'' she said. ''This is my home. I want to know who youre bringing into my home.''</p>
        <p>At a City Council meeting that afternoon, she introduced Mr. Murray and the state team. In her office later, Ms. Faison sighed. ''We do need the help,'' she said. ''We can't afford to pay for it.''</p>
