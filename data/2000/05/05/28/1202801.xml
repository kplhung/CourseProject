        <p>Every week or so on an asphalt court at Astoria Park in Queens, my buddies and I play a high-spirited if rather gimpy version of pickup basketball. You would never need to watch our moves in slow motion. Real time, sadly, is desultory enough. After the game, we unwrap our Ace bandages, slide off our knee braces and pat down our own bodies like cops to make sure all the parts are still there.</p>
        <p>And that's when the real dramatics begin. That's when we launch into our Homeric chronicles of bodily degeneration. How lovingly we narrate our twinges and spasms, the harrowing sagas of bum knees and frayed rotator cuffs and tender ankles. Like cartographers of the 15th century, we map out whole continents of pain, heretofore unvisited regions of ache and bruise. To listen to us, you'd think we had double-parked our wheelchairs in a spot of sun down in Miami Beach.</p>

        <p>Every week or so on an asphalt court at Astoria Park in Queens, my buddies and I play a high-spirited if rather gimpy version of pickup basketball. You would never need to watch our moves in slow motion. Real time, sadly, is desultory enough. After the game, we unwrap our Ace bandages, slide off our knee braces and pat down our own bodies like cops to make sure all the parts are still there.</p>
        <p>And that's when the real dramatics begin. That's when we launch into our Homeric chronicles of bodily degeneration. How lovingly we narrate our twinges and spasms, the harrowing sagas of bum knees and frayed rotator cuffs and tender ankles. Like cartographers of the 15th century, we map out whole continents of pain, heretofore unvisited regions of ache and bruise. To listen to us, you'd think we had double-parked our wheelchairs in a spot of sun down in Miami Beach.</p>
        <p>But it's not just age catching up with us. (Some of us are barely old enough to grow silly goatees.) It's the age. The whole culture is transfixed by the travails of the body. Men used to be pretty stiff-lipped about pain. Our bodies were these dumb pack animals that lugged our lunchpails to the factory or the field and then home again. They weren't very smart but they didn't complain very much either. Now we live in a time when our bodies are -- or are supposed to be -- temples to Narcissus. There at those well-chiseled altars we beseechingly leave our offerings of Gatorade and PowerBars and creatine.</p>
        <p>I suspect that our increasing body consciousness is one reason that accounts of injuries have become one of the central tropes of sports journalism. (That and the fact that the seasons are too long.) This isn't to say they haven't mattered in the past: witness Willis Reed's hobbled glory in the 1970 N.B.A. finals or the funereal coverage of Joe Namath's rickety knees throughout the rest of the decade. What is different is how commonplace such reporting is now. At times this month, the N.B.A. playoffs have seemed less like basketball games and more like particularly athletic episodes of ''E.R.'' (Paging Dr. J.!) The plot lines read as follows: Will Tim Duncan, 24, recover from his knee injury in time to prevent the defending champion San Antonio Spurs from being ignominously bounced in the first round of the playoffs? Can Patrick Ewing's clattering knees and Larry Johnson's battered back survive the rigors of yet another season? Will the soft tissue -- and have we ever heard those two words in relation to a basketball game before? -- of the foot of the Miami Heat point guard Tim Hardaway, 33, bear up sufficiently for a series with the Knicks?</p>
        <p>Every week USA Today issues a full page of injury reports for major league teams in baseball, football, basketball and hockey. It's a rather grisly if deadpan catalog of all the ways a body can come apart under the duress of high-performance athletics: ruptured spleens, bruised kidneys, brain concussions, torn biceps, disintegrated A.C.L.'s, separated shoulders, even the relatively petite-sounding turf toes (which actually hurt like hell). The real drama for me last football season was not whether the Miami Dolphins would get to the Super Bowl, but whether their aging quarterback Dan Marino, 38, would be able to lift himself off the grass after another year of vicious pounding by opposing teams. In baseball, it's a matter of high suspense to see whether the arm of Boston's Bret Saberhagen, 36, recovering from its third surgery, can pitch its way off the disabled list this season without flying off into the grandstand at Fenway Park.</p>
        <p>Of course, athletes simply face their mortal limits earlier and more publicly than the rest of us, and in doing so, presage our own. A year ago, one sportswriter called Patrick Ewing ''a relic in need of grease and oil.'' He was a mere 36. The gymnast Shannon Miller, who retired two years ago to pursue mature activities like college and marriage, is making a ''comeback'' at the elderly age of 23. Nothing makes you feel more decrepit than being a spectator of the new demisport of competitive physical therapy.</p>
        <p>To some extent, sports stories have always been about the triumphs and failures of the body in relation to the will. Some of these narratives of injury attest to the glories of modern medicine, the way new surgical techniques have prolonged careers that would have ended precipitously as recently as a decade ago. They're also a byproduct of the Infotainment Age, wherein an ever-expanding media must find ever more to report.</p>
        <p>But even more important, these point to the way American men are starting to look at their bodies quite differently from generations past. They're discovering the same sort of unfortunate drama inherent in aging that women have agonized about for decades. It's amusing, of course, that sports, a formerly male domain, should insinuate anxiety into men in a way that contradicts the old notion that men age gracefully, women just sag. As men these days watch and play sports, they're no longer just released back into the childhood pleasures of games, of winning and losing, but faced as well with the novel terrors of present and future ruination. What's true for the most spectacular athletes in the world is also true for their fans. We're all now scrutinizing our bodies for the next sign of decay.</p>
        <p>My shoulder hurts just thinking about it.</p>
