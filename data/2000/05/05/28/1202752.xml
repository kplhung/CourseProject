        <p>THE OTHER AMERICAN</p>
        <p>The Life of Michael Harrington.</p>
        <p>By Maurice Isserman.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 449 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>PublicAffairs. $28.50.</p>
        <p>This book is mainly about ''The Life of Michael Harrington,'' its subtitle. But given the nature of Harrington's idiosyncratic career, ''The Other American'' is also a veritable Zagat's guide through the left sectarian factions of the last three-quarters of the 20th century. Maurice Isserman, a Hamilton College historian who specializes in studies of the left, knows that one can't really understand Harrington unless one understands some of the maddening political nuances of the recent past -- the difference, say, between the Cannonites and the Shachtmanites.</p>
        <p>Not that Harrington, who died of cancer at the age of 61 in 1989, was a sectarian. Though he often joked that he was ''America's oldest young socialist,'' Harrington made his major imprint on the national psyche at 35 in 1963, when President John F. Kennedy discovered, through Dwight Macdonald's 50-page New Yorker essay-review of Harrington's book ''The Other America,'' that there were 40 to 60 million people living in poverty in what many had been calling our affluent society.</p>
        <p>Until then, according to Isserman, thinking about the poor within the Kennedy administration had been ''piecemeal.'' Harrington's book supplied the organizing concept, the target, the word, and thus was the idea for the War on Poverty born. It can indeed be argued that what Betty Friedan's ''Feminine Mystique'' did for feminism, Rachel Carson's ''Silent Spring'' for the environment and Ralph Nader's ''Unsafe at Any Speed'' for the public interest movement, ''The Other America'' did for the poor. Two decades later, when Charles Murray began his attack on the welfare system, Harrington's analysis of the culture of poverty was the main hurdle in his path. Murray called Harrington the ''pamphleteer'' for the poor.</p>
        <p>Harrington was a social critic whose writing seemed to grow out of his political activities rather than vice versa. Born in 1928 into a middle-class Irish Catholic family in St. Louis, he attended a Jesuit high school and a Jesuit college (Holy Cross), and started out as a Republican. But after trying a year of law school at Yale and a year of graduate school in literature at the University of Chicago, he headed straight for Greenwich Village and a job with Dorothy Day's Catholic Worker movement, which, as he later put it, was ''as far left as you could go within the church.'' Day (who was recently proposed to the Vatican for beatification) had toiled for The Masses, The Liberator and The New Masses before she founded her own radical pacifist paper, named after her movement. Of this sometimes autocratic pacifist, one Catholic Worker said, ''Dorothy wanted to be an anarchist, but only if she got to be the anarch.''</p>
        <p>By day, when he wasn't sweeping the floor or literally hand-folding the eight-page 5,000-circulation tabloid The Catholic Worker, Harrington was filling its pages with articles and reviews, many written under inscrutable pseudonyms to avoid Harrington-byline overload. By night he was exploring the Village in general and the White Horse Tavern in particular, where he sang, argued about literature and politics and downed pints of half-and-half with various folk-singing Clancy brothers, the then tempestuous Norman Mailer and the young Daniel Patrick Moynihan, among other marathon conversationalists. ''I was in the Horse every night for more than 10 years,'' Harrington wrote in his memoirs. ''As the people of KRated PG-13nigsberg were said to set their clocks by Immanuel Kant's walks, you would see me, punctually dissolute, appear on weeknights at midnight and on weekends at 1 o'clock.'' It was in the Horse that he met and wooed Stephanie Gervis, who ended up with him in what is reputed to have been The Village Voice's first and only marriage announcement.</p>
        <p>In 1952 he left The Catholic Worker and his roach-infested room in the East Village and headed across town to work for a socialist future. But Harrington's socialism at this time was not that of the Socialist Party, under whose banner Eugene V. Debs had won almost a million votes in the 1920 presidential election. Instead, he joined the Young People's Socialist League, the youth wing of a faction known as the Independent Socialist League. And here is where the difference between the Shachtmanites and the Cannonites comes in.</p>
        <p>James Cannon was the head of the Trotskyist Socialist Workers Party in the late 1930's and, following Leon Trotsky, argued that the Soviet Union was a ''degenerated workers' state.'' Max Shachtman and his colleague James Burnham disagreed, insisting that the Soviet Union was not a workers' state, degenerated or otherwise; rather, it was a ''bureaucratic collectivist state,'' and as such no longer deserved socialist support. In the early days of World War II, they walked out of the Socialist Workers Party and formed their own Workers Party, soon reconstituted as the Independent Socialist League. (Burnham, by the way, kept right on walking and a decade later found himself on the editorial board of William F. Buckley's National Review.) Before long, Harrington was an editor of Young Socialist Challenge, a weekly four-page insert in Shachtman's paper, Labor Action, which itself numbered Irving Howe among its previous editors. (When, in 1954, Hal Draper, the current editor of Labor Action, criticized Howe for abandoning ''the struggle,'' Howe responded, ''What struggles does Draper have except the very real one to fill the pages of Labor Action every week?'')</p>
        <p>Isserman proceeds to track Harrington's political evolution through his voluminous writings: 14 books and scores of articles he published in such journals of opinion as Commonweal, Partisan Review, The New Republic, Commentary and The Nation. Moreover, it seemed that every new political tendency gave rise to a new journal, organ or fugitive newsletter, and Harrington either edited or wrote for all of them, including Anvil (1951); Dissent (1955), Irving Howe's antisectarian socialist magazine; Liberation (1956), David Dellinger's radical pacifist quarterly; New American (1960), the Socialist Party's biweekly; and so forth.</p>
        <p>Isserman carefully documents the twists and turns in Harrington's ever-evolving line, including his break with Shachtman over the Vietnam War (which Harrington himself, by Isserman's lights, was woefully late to recognize as a moral disaster) and his conversion from an anti-Communist absolutism that led him to denounce the New Left (which had no compunctions about working with Communists) in the early 1960's to a cold war neutralism that led him repeatedly to apologize for his previous denunciations. But Isserman makes clear that notwithstanding Harrington's personal identification with the Socialism of Debs and Norman Thomas, the most consistent thread running through his life and his work was his effort to create a ''left wing of the possible,'' which, by the end, had become ''a 'left wing of the possible' within the Democratic Party.'' Even as he was commuting from his home in Westchester (''Friedrich Engels was a businessman, for Christ's sake,'' he told one critic of his bourgeois lifestyle), he continued to commute between his life as a Socialist and his behind-the-scenes role as a lobbyist for a more progressive Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>Neoconservatives may judge Isserman too sympathetic to Harrington's eventual cold war neutralism. Feminists may find him insufficiently outraged at Harrington's early manifestations of male chauvinism. Right-wingers will condemn Isserman's acceptance of socialist values. And sectarians of every stripe will find him too tolerant of other sectarians. But in the end, while one may differ with his judgments on this and that and wish he had said more about why Socialism has never taken hold in the United States, Isserman has given us the facts to make up our own minds in this fair and fascinating account of a charismatic and appealing actor on the American political stage.</p>
        <p>The question remains: Was it, finally, all a waste of time, energy and talent? I'm not so sure. In addition to Harrington himself, the alumni of Shachtmanism include Howe, the public education innovator Deborah Meier, trade union leaders too numerous to mention and, oh yes, journalists like Dwight Macdonald, who was first a Cannonite and then a Shachtmanite, before he abandoned his old comrades to start his own pacifist, anarchist, Trotskyist magazine, Politics, which ran for five years, after which he was discovered by . . . The New Yorker.</p>
