        <p>THE Greenbrier hotel, the luxurious resort in this Appalachian Mountain valley town, and Dolan, Pollak &amp; Schram, a Georgia developer, are planning  a community of vacation houses on the hotel grounds.</p>
        <p>Dolan, Pollak, which built a similar development near Savannah, Ga., at a plantation once owned by Henry Ford, expects to begin selling the first of 500 lots at the Greenbrier in July. Prices will range from $250,000 for cottage-sized lots of 60 feet by 100 feet to $1 million for three to five acres at the base of the mountains that surround the hotel. The focus will be a sporting club atmosphere, with golf, tennis, riding and other activities, and the developers will handle grass cutting and yard maintenance.</p>
        <p>Ted J. Kleisner, who has been the president of the Greenbrier since 1987, said the resort had embarked on a real estate venture, Greenbrier Village, in the 1980's but discontinued it because company officials were not confident they could successfully develop the property. Thirty-eight cottages were built beside a golf course, and 14 houses were constructed on larger lots nearby. A 15th is now under construction.</p>
        <p>One limitation on the earlier sales effort was that a significant piece of property -- a hillside tract surrounding the hotel -- could not be touched until 1995, when the federal government ended its lease on a once-secret underground bunker, designed to house Congress in the event of nuclear war.</p>
        <p>The 112,000-square-foot bunker had two meeting halls, one for the House and one for the Senate; communications centers; a safe room with copies of documents that would be necessary to keep the government running; a hospital; 18 dormitories with 30 metal bunk beds in each; and enough food to last for a month or more.</p>
        <p>A wing of the hotel was built over the bunker to conceal it, and it remained secret until 1992, when newspaper articles about it appeared. It is now open for tours.</p>
        <p>Copeland Hill will be the site of the first cottages to be built as part of the sporting club. The property now has 10 tennis courts on it, the only use the federal government would allow.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kleisner said after the government lease ended, the company decided to take another look at development. ''But we had to do it right,'' he said, explaining that most developers wanted to build tightly spaced houses along the resort's three golf courses, creating ''fairway canyons.'' The resort, which is owned by the CSX Corporation, spreads over 6,500 acres, from the top of Kate's Mountain northwest across the valley to the top of Greenbrier Mountain. ''This land has been maintained in an almost pristine fashion, and it is unacceptable to do anything less'' than to be a good steward of the land, Mr. Kleisner said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kleisner had originally met two of the principals in the development firm, Peter Pollak and Chip Dolan, when he was looking for a vacation home several years ago. The third partner in Dolan, Pollak is Steve Schram, a former investment banker who once ran the Boston Celtics basketball team and other businesses it owns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kleisner looked at Bray's Island Plantation, a former estate turned vacation-home community near Beaufort, S.C., that Mr. Dolan and Mr. Pollak were marketing. He chose a home in Savannah instead but remembered the two salesmen, who moved on to develop the Ford Plantation, 1,800 acres near Savannah on the Ogeechee River that has sold $60 million in building lots in the last 15 months.</p>
        <p>The partners are relying on the reputation of the Greenbrier as a grand hotel with fastidious service and on its long history to help market the real estate. AAA gives the resort five diamonds, its top rating, and it has been designated as a National Historic Landmark.</p>
        <p>The Greenbrier has about 90,000 guests a year, about half of whom have been there before. Conventions make up about 50 percent of its business, and in the last year, it has been host to the Business Council, the Grocery Manufacturers of America and the Chemical Manufacturers of America.</p>
        <p>People have been coming to what is now White Sulphur Springs and to the valley along Howard's Creek since 1778, when a woman now known only as Mrs. Anderson is said to have found that the sulphur spring cured her rheumatism.</p>
        <p>THE spring house, built decades later when the property became a full-fledged resort, still stands, but people  wanting to take the sulphur water, with its smell of rotten eggs, now dip from a free-running spigot, not a hole in the ground.</p>
        <p>The resort served as the summer White House for Martin Van Buren in 1838. Dwight D. Eisenhower was the last sitting president  to stay at the hotel, and his visit has been the subject of much speculation.</p>
        <p>Eisenhower came in 1956 to meet with the president of Mexico, arriving by train and making no stops along the 250-mile route between Washington and White Sulphur Springs.</p>
        <p>Dr. Robert S. Conte, the Greenbrier's staff historian, said that many people believe this was a test run to see if it might have been possible to move Congress to White Sulphur Springs if nuclear war broke out. About the time of the Eisenhower visit, or perhaps before, the federal government and the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway, the forerunner of CSX, began negotiations on  building the bunker.</p>
        <p>It was completed just before the Cuban missile crisis in 1962, and that was the only time in its history that the bunker was on high alert, said Paul E. Bugas, its on-site manager from 1971 to 1995. He still manages the bunker, but for the Greenbrier, which  operates it as a tourist attraction. Some 14,000 guests each year pay $25 to see where their legislators would have lived if the Cold  War had ever turned hot. The president and the judicial branch would have been evacuated to another bunker, this one at Mount Weather near Berryville, Va.</p>
        <p>The bunker cost the government $10 million. It also spent $4 million on what is now called the West Virginia Wing, an 86-room hotel addition that sits atop the bunker.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bugas, who is known as Fritz, said a six-word phrase -- ''The lease agreement is being activated'' -- would have set his staff to work. The bunker was supposed to be ready to run within a four-hour time limit. Information on how the legislators would have been transported is still classified, but the Greenbrier airport, 10 miles away, has a 7,000-foot runway, long enough to land a military transport.</p>
        <p>This history is what Dolan, Pollak is counting on to help it sell 100 lots a year, or about $300 million over five years, Mr. Pollak said. A fourth golf course, a lodge and stables are to be built for the sole use of the homeowners, Mr. Pollak said, but they will also be able to use the Greenbrier's existing  golf courses, tennis courts, stables, indoor and outdoor pools, spa and a Land Rover  driving course.</p>
        <p>The architectural plans for the homes' exteriors must be approved by the developers, who, unlike many resort developers, do not plan to turn over the operation to the homeowners once the project is completed.</p>
        <p>The homes will be spread out over the property, and the goal is to make them as unobtrusive as possible, Mr. Pollak said. Mr. Kleisner, the Greenbrier's president, said the target market would be wealthy families who enjoy the outdoors but also want to preserve the land.</p>
        <p>The partners hope to expand the sporting club premise to other historic sites, but they say their standards will limit the possibilities. ''We've turned down opportunities,''  Mr. Schram said. ''Some things won't work, and some things won't fit. It has to be a very special place, one of historic significance.''</p>
