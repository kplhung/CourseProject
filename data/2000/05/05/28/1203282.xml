        <p>The engines generate a mere five horsepower and the top speed is only 35 miles per hour, but the excitement will be full scale at Grand Prix III in Mount Vernon next Sunday when 29 go-cart-size racing cars compete.</p>
        <p>''Let me tell you, when you're this close to the ground, it feels like 150 miles per hour,'' said Leslie Alpert, an aide to Mayor Ernest D. Davis who participated last year and will be in this year's race. ''If you go over a cigarette butt, you feel it. These little cars have no shock absorbers -- your body absorbs all the shock.''</p>
        <p>The free event begins at 10 A.M. with practice sessions. Qualifying heats are at 1 p.m. and the race is at 3:30. Drivers will do 15 laps around the half-mile course on Gramatan Avenue to Sidney Avenue to North Third Avenue and back onto Gramatan. In 1999, almost $10,000 was raised for the city's youth employment program, through fees paid by competitors. The year's goal is $20,000.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 17, the Arthritis Foundation will run a similar race in White Plains, hoping to raise $150,000.</p>
