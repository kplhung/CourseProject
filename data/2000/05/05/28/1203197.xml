        <p>Raise your hand if you want to get really close to a big hairy tarantula, five giant cockroaches or a rat with a 10-inch tail. Take one step forward if bugs and vermin give you sweaty palms, weak knees and shortness of breath.</p>
        <p>Dr. Harvey Baker, a professor of psychology at Queens College, who suffers from a mild cockroach anxiety, is struggling to find enough highly phobic subjects willing to stare down the stars of their worst nightmares in the name of science.</p>
        <p>If he could just get 100 volunteers, Dr. Baker said, he could determine whether his rather unusual treatment for the intense fear of rodents and insects, which draws on self-esteem building, psychotherapy and the principle of acupuncture, holds up as a genuine cure. But since he began seeking subjects in February, he has come up with just six people.</p>
        <p>It would not be difficult to find New Yorkers who are afraid of the urban critters Dr. Baker keeps in glass boxes in his laboratory on the college's campus in Flushing. This is a city with so many rats that exterminating them commands an annual budget of $13.5 million and where the price of living in a rent-stabilized apartment is often rooming with a cockroach -- and all of its relatives.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Baker seeks the truly phobic for his experiment, which he believes is the first of its kind in the country. He needs the people who can't move for hours after seeing a spider on their window sill or have to flee their apartment for weeks when a rat crawls from behind the refrigerator. He has posted fliers all over the campus urging students to sign up for the study.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Baker said he was willing to wait for subjects. At the rate he is going -- one volunteer every other week -- he will need an extra 188 weeks of research.</p>
        <p>''Most people with specific phobias do not seek treatment,'' he said. ''They rearrange their lives to avoid the problem.</p>
        <p>''Nothing helps, so they live with it,'' he added, speaking in the laboratory he shares with five Madagascar hissing cockroaches and a Chilean rose-haired tarantula named Matilda. (The rat, Albert, is a hooded rat, a ''friendlier'' species than the typical city rat, which is kept at another spot in the science building and taken to the lab for experiments, Dr. Baker said.)</p>
        <p>Dr. Baker, who has researched and taught in the Queens College psychology department since 1974, said 6.1 percent of Americans -- almost 17 million people -- have a potentially debilitating phobia of small animals, including rats, snakes, spiders and cockroaches.</p>
        <p>Dr. Baker's sixth subject, Joe Orsi, decided to tackle his spider phobia and volunteered for a 90-minute session with Dr. Baker and the tarantula.</p>
        <p>Mr. Orsi, 24, who lives in Middle Village, Queens, works for a restaurant supply company in Manhattan. He often sees dead spiders in his company's basement, he said. It makes him panic.</p>
        <p>Dr. Baker's assistant, Michelle Guttman, a graduate student, interviewed Mr. Orsi about his phobia for 15 minutes. Then, she guided him into another room, where the tarantula was waiting. She scored his level of fear during the approach.</p>
        <p>Even before Mr. Orsi opened the door to the other room, the heart rate monitor clipped to his ear lobe showed his pulse was racing. By the time he laid his eyes on Matilda, his pulse had shot up 20 beats per minute. He could not take the final step, in which he was asked to touch the part of the glass cage closest to the tarantula.</p>
        <p>Mr. Orsi returned to his seat to fill out a questionnaire checked yes to all nine symptoms of the phobia, from ''lump in throat,'' to ''hands feel cold.''</p>
        <p>Then came a 45-minute treatment. Dr. Baker said he learned about it at a conference a year ago and decided to apply it to the rat, spider and cockroach phobias.</p>
        <p>Dr. Baker asked Mr. Orsi to tap various parts of his body while saying, ''fear of spiders,'' to hum, count out loud and say things like, ''I forgive myself for anything I might have done to cause my fear of spiders.'' The tapping, drawn from acupuncture, is aimed at pressure points that, when struck, are supposed to release negative energy from the body, Dr. Baker said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Orsi seemed to have a lot of negative energy toward Matilda.</p>
        <p>When the session was over, Mr. Orsi went through a second interview, and again approached the tarantula. This time, his pulse was 15 beats slower than when he first looked at the spider, and he took the final step, touching the glass near the tarantula, and lingering for a moment to look at the spider.</p>
        <p>Only three of Dr. Baker's six subjects have undergone the full treatment, because some are randomly placed in a control group, but all three have shown signs of improvement. Still, Dr. Baker acknowledged that it might be years before he could draw any conclusions.</p>
