        <p>Elderly residents say the hilly tree-lined streets from 181st Street to the Cloisters are a great place to live. Local teenage boys think these same streets, which include some of the steepest in Manhattan, are a great place to race through on their bicycles.</p>
        <p>The two reasons for loving the area do not mix well. At a recent community meeting at the Fort Tryon Jewish Center, so many speakers complained about the bicycles that organizers had to coax the crowd of 100 to address different topics.</p>
        <p>Councilman Stanley E. Michels said the speeding bikes were dangerous. ''I have seen near accidents, and I've almost been hit myself,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Patting a representative of the district attorney's office, he added, ''My friend will prosecute to the limit of the law.'' Mr. Michels was joking, but the police can seize bicycles from reckless riders, and  have done so in the past.</p>
        <p>Police Lt. Jimmy Griffin of the 34th Precinct, who also attended the meeting,  has since said that the police plan to step up traffic enforcement against cyclists.</p>
        <p>The cyclists are easy to spot as they  speed along sidewalks or blaze down hills after school. Some have been spotted playing chicken with buses on Fort Washington Avenue.</p>
        <p>The subway system unwittingly aids the cyclists: at the bottom of the hills, both the 181st Street and 190th Street stations of the A train have elevators that allow riders to bypass the grueling climb back up. Elevator operators have reported seeing the same youngsters repeatedly in a single afternoon.</p>
        <p>In interviews, elderly residents said they felt the most vulnerable. ''Sometimes they come silently right by you,'' said one woman in her 70's. ''If you make one wrong move, you go down.''</p>
        <p>Residents of all ages worry about the riders themselves, who seldom wear helmets and sometimes ride two or three to a bicycle. ''As a parent, my heart is in my mouth every time I see them,'' said Lorraine Chanon, a teacher.</p>
        <p>The cyclists' motive is simple: fun. ''The people that complain a lot, the ones that are not too old, they should get a bike and they would know how we feel,'' said Alex Portes, 15. ''They'd be doing it every day.''</p>
        <p>Two years ago, Alfredo Balbuena broke a leg when he was hit by a car. ''It's dangerous,'' he said. ''It's not really funny. They should put in speed bumps.''</p>
        <p>But it was hard to gauge his sincerity. Mr. Balbuena, 18, had just raced down a hill without a helmet, talking on his cell phone.</p>
