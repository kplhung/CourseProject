        <p>George Tamblyn, letter, responds to Fred Brock's May 7 article on 'silent' generation, those Americans, now in the mid-50's to early 70's, who are too young to have fought in World War II but too old to be considered baby boomers; drawing (M)</p>

        <p>In ''The Silent Generation Seeks Its Due (May 7)'' Fred Brock looked at Americans who are too young to have fought in World War II but too old to be considered baby boomers. Members of that age group, in their mid-50's to early 70's, often feel overlooked by employers, marketers and the popular culture.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I found the piece to be provocative. I am smack in the middle of the Silent Generation, with my 63rd birthday next month. A lawyer for 30 years, entrepreneur for 15, and now a graduate student in history, writing a thesis on guess what?: Winston Churchill and the Bombing of Germany, I suppose I reflect some of the panic and desire for adventure you observed.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I found the piece to be provocative. I am smack in the middle of the Silent Generation, with my 63rd birthday next month. A lawyer for 30 years, entrepreneur for 15, and now a graduate student in history, writing a thesis on guess what?: Winston Churchill and the Bombing of Germany, I suppose I reflect some of the panic and desire for adventure you observed.</p>
        <p>Although I surely have romanticized war (three years ago I paid good money to fly a B-17 and I cannot deny that it was a  huge thrill), in my more reflective moments, I cannot honestly say that I regret missing ''my war.'' I wonder how much those thoughts and role expectations contribute to the existence of wars.</p>
        <p>I do, however, miss the feeling that I, somehow, have been part of something  meaningful and positive. I am not sure that the opportunity for that has entirely passed me by. I can see that Joe Taylor may be responding in many ways to the desire to be part of ''building something'' -- or, in his case, many things. In my state of good health, it looks probable that I will have 20 to 30 years more of life to participate in a meaningful way.</p>
        <p>Sitting by a golf course does not cut it. At this point, as far as I have gotten in conceptualizing what I might do is be part of educating future generations. Maybe the whole point of it is to learn to accept, for ourselves, that ''doing something'' is not, in the big picture, the object of life and maybe learning to live life in a truly good way (being good to others every day, every way), may be more to the point.</p>
