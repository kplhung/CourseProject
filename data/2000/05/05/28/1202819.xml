        <p>A golden owl, streaked with copper and brown, his wings stretched wide, has landed on a curly baby goat. The kid, half his size, struggles to get free. But from under brows as thick and dark as a melodrama villain's, the owl's eyes make it clear: butchery will follow. Amazingly, this powerful image is only three inches across; its medium thousands of bits of glass called tesserae. The owl attacking a kid is a micromosaic; a term that did not exist 50 years ago, although the technique is more than two centuries old.</p>
        <p>Mosaics, of which micromosaics are the miniaturized form, are an ancient medium. Shimmering, translucent tesserae of gold line the walls of such glorious churches as San Marco in Venice, and earlier the Romans used mosaics to decorate their villas. The finest example from that epoch is the Doves of Pliny, a wall plaque about 33 inches by 38 inches, in which four pale birds perch on the lip of a water-filled bowl. It is made of 160 pieces of naturally colored stone to every square inch, and caused a sensation when it was uncovered at Hadrian's villa near Rome in 1737. The villa immediately became a ''must see'' stop on the grand tour to Rome.</p>
        <p>The doves created a new market, and the Vatican's mosaicists, worried because their work on St. Peter's was ending, set out to supply it. The first recorded showing of their new technique, mosaico in piccolo, as it was called, was in 1775. Incredibly, there were 1,400 glass bits to the square inch.</p>
        <p>The time-consuming new craft became a prized if costly luxury. Pope Pius VII took a gift of a micromosaic-decorated clock to Napoleon's coronation in 1804. Czar Nicholas I commissioned a table ringed with views of the sites he loved most on his Italian tour. According to the collector Sir Arthur Gilbert, such pieces today cost less than when they were made, adjusting for changes in currency.</p>
        <p>Sir Arthur should know. First smitten by the form in the 1960's, he has amassed more than 200 examples. The Vatican Museum and the State Hermitage Museum of St. Petersburg may have had the best public collections, but Sir Arthur had the most important private collection. It isn't private any longer: the Gilbert Collection of Decorative Arts, featuring the stupendous works in silver and gold for which Sir Arthur is already well known, has been given to the British people and is on permanent public view at Somerset House here.</p>
        <p>Full-size copies of old master paintings are part of Sir Arthur's micromosaic collection, as is that papal clock, the owl attacking the kid and a round table, very like the Czar's, on which famous Italian monuments surround a central blue sky. There is jewelry, too, and portraits. And what may be the finest micromosaic extant, an exquisite head of Bacchus.</p>
        <p>As his passion grew, Sir Arthur, who coined the term micromosaics, wanted to see and learn more. He could find nothing: no American museum collections, no books. In the second half of the 19th century, quality had deteriorated as output increased to meet the growth in tourism. By the time Sir Arthur began collecting, micromosaics had been long out of fashion and their production was a forgotten craft.</p>
        <p>Magnifying glasses are thoughtfully provided at the exhibition, enabling visitors to examine the tiny works, and a suite of rooms is given over to explaining techniques. A catalog of the collection's micromosaics has an excellent and informative essay by Judy Rudoe, the curator of medieval and later antiquities at the British Museum.</p>
        <p>There is a ''holy cow!'' aspect to micromosaics. So many thousands of pieces so closely packed with a finish smooth as a varnished oil. But as Geoffrey Munn, managing director of the London jeweler Wartski, warns, when you have a great tour de force of technique, sometimes inspiration is lost. ''You are showing off your technical prowess at the expense of your artistic soul,'' he says.</p>
        <p>The greatest masters of the micromosaic form were men for whom technical wizardry was not an end in itself but a stimulus. The owl and the kid and the head of Bacchus are but two of the objects in the Gilbert Collection that are as aesthetically rewarding as they are technically astonishing.</p>
