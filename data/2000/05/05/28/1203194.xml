        <p>As President Clinton nears a decision on whether to build a limited national missile defense, American intelligence officials are warning that such a system could set off a cold-war-style arms race between China, India and Pakistan, administration officials say.</p>
        <p>While the American officials have repeatedly said an antimissile defense is not aimed at Beijing, even they acknowledge that the system being designed could significantly undercut or even neutralize China's small nuclear force.</p>
        <p>That could lead China to add to its nuclear arsenal. And if China built up its force, its regional rival India could do the same, as could India's rival Pakistan, heightening tensions along the world's newest nuclear frontier.</p>
        <p>Such a scenario, which officials are expected to outline for Mr. Clinton in an official intelligence estimate due in June, has raised questions about the administration's own efforts to try to slow the spread of nuclear weapons and the ballistic missiles needed to launch them.</p>
        <p>''If China increases the number of missiles it has, would India think it has to increase its missiles?'' said a senior United States official familiar with the analysis being prepared. ''And if India increases its missiles, then Pakistan does.''</p>
        <p>President Clinton has said he plans to decide later this year whether to proceed with a missile defense based on four criteria: the missile threat, technological viability of the program, the effect on arms control and cost. The response from China and Russia is an important factor in Mr. Clinton's decision.</p>
        <p>While newly disclosed defense documents indicate that the Pentagon was researching ways in the mid-1990's to counter a limited Chinese missile attack, defense officials say that is no longer the American policy. The system under consideration, they insist, is intended to counter relatively small, unsophisticated missile threats from countries like North Korea, Iran and Iraq.</p>
        <p>Samuel R. Berger, President Clinton's national security adviser, says Beijing's concerns may be eased not only by reassurances about the intent of the system but by general progress in economic and political relations.</p>
        <p>''There are other dimensions to the relationship with the Chinese that are of far more long-term importance than national missile defense,'' Mr. Berger said in an interview.</p>
        <p>The administration has expended enormous diplomatic energy -- unsuccessfully so far -- trying to persuade the Russians that a missile defense system would not threaten its much larger strategic forces. It has made even less headway with the Chinese.</p>
        <p>There are several reasons why. Unlike Russia, which still maintains a force of more than 5,000 warheads from the cold war, China has deployed a minimal nuclear force, primarily 18 single-warhead land-based CSS-4 missiles.</p>
        <p>The argument that the Clinton administration has used with the Russians -- that a limited missile defense is not a threat because it could be easily swamped by an overwhelming Russian missile attack -- does not apply to the Chinese.</p>
        <p>China's old liquid-fueled CSS-4 missiles are kept on low alert with the warheads stored separately from the missiles. China also has 12 missiles on a submarine that rarely strays far from its port, from which it cannot reach the United States. And China seems convinced that the system would come closer to neutralizing its current nuclear force than has been publicly acknowledged.</p>
        <p>''We don't deny to the Chinese that the system has some capability against Chinese missiles, but that is not what it is designed to do,'' said the under secretary of defense for policy, Walter B. Slocombe, said in an interview.</p>
        <p>Another factor is China's apprehensions about the future course of relations with Washington.</p>
        <p>American defense officials make plans according to a rival's perceived capabilities, not its intent. The Chinese make the same point, and complain that despite the assurances of the Clinton administration, they cannot be certain that a future administration would not use a missile defense against it, especially since China has often been cast as a threat by conservative Republicans.</p>
        <p>A Clinton administration official said: ''The Chinese tell us, 'You may not be directing the system against us, but what about the next guy? How can we be confident that the next administration may not have a different policy? It could use the system against us, just as it does against North Korea.' ''</p>
        <p>The Chinese also fear that the United States could adjust and expand a limited defense, which in its first phase will consist of a battle-management radar site in Alaska and 100 interceptors. And George W. Bush, the Republican candidate, has said the United States would develop a far more ambitious defensive system if he is elected president.</p>
        <p>Another reason for the Chinese suspicions is that the Pentagon has previously worked on defensive systems to counter the Chinese arsenal.</p>
        <p>During the Bush administration, the Pentagon instructed the TRW Corporation, an American military contractor, to develop ground-based interceptors that would stop ''limited attacks by China'' using CSS-4 missiles, according to a 1993 document prepared by the United States Army.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon insists that countering China is no longer a goal, and its Ballistic Missile Defense Organization declined to say whether it is still studying ways to intercept Chinese warheads.</p>
        <p>But defense officials acknowledge that the planning documents are constantly updated with the latest science and intelligence estimates of ballistic missiles.</p>
        <p>Beyond a direct threat from China, there are other reasons why the Pentagon might want to develop the means to thwart its missile systems. American intelligence officials cautioned in a 1999 analysis that Russia and China might sell countermeasures like decoy warheads to developing nations the United States wants to defend against.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon's missile-defense organization has also acknowledged that the new American defense would have the ''residual capability'' to defend against the ''unauthorized launch by an established nuclear power of a few missiles with simple countermeasures,'' a definition that includes the Chinese.</p>
        <p>''The system has to be able to respond to more than just North Korea,'' a defense industry official said.</p>
        <p>Seeking to ease China's concerns, the Clinton administration has argued that while an antimissile system may be effective against China's current arsenal, it would be less so against the updated arsenal China has long planned to build.</p>
        <p>Even before the Clinton administration began seriously considering antimissile defenses, the Chinese were planning to deploy a solid-fueled land-based missile of intercontinental range that could be moved around on a truck, as well as a new submarine-launched missile.</p>
        <p>American intelligence officials project that the Chinese will have  ''several tens'' of new and old missiles that can reach the United States by 2015 under Beijing's current modernization plan.</p>
        <p>A missile defense, then, would have little effect on the Chinese strategic modernization, Pentagon officials assert. China, they add, is more anxious about the provision of antimissile technology to Taiwan than it is about a defense to protect the United States.</p>
        <p>Despite these arguments, however, Pentagon officials acknowledge that they know very little about the missiles, warheads and countermeasures the Chinese plan to deploy.</p>
        <p>''We assume the Chinese plan to modernize their force,'' a senior Pentagon official said. ''It's impossible to say how much it would be affected by a national missile defense of the kind we're talking about.''</p>
        <p>Some senior intelligence experts nonetheless believe that a missile defense will prompt the Chinese to build up their strategic force beyond what they had previously planned, in order to ensure that it remains viable.</p>
        <p>Such a response by China would be consistent with orthodox arms control theory, which holds that the construction of a missile defense prompts an adversary to build more missiles in the hope that at least some can get through the defense.</p>
        <p>The American intelligence community's assessment will be contained in a new official intelligence report on the responses of foreign governments to a United States missile defense. The White House asked in December that the report be prepared so that Mr. Clinton could consider it in making his decision on a missile defense. Officials caution that the estimate is still being prepared.</p>
        <p>''We would expect them to continue and perhaps even enhance countermeasures,'' a senior United States official said. ''We have projected that they will have several tens of missiles by 2015. National Missile Defense might prompt them to do more than that.''</p>
        <p>''That would be likely,'' the senior official added.</p>
        <p>One way for the Chinese to extend their build-up would be to add new warheads to their old 18 CSS-4, transforming them from single-warhead missiles into four-warhead missiles. They might also double the size of their projected land-based mobile missiles.</p>
        <p>As a result, the Chinese could have more than 100 warheads by 2015, which is more than the 100 interceptors the United States plans to deploy in the first phase of its missile defense. The Chinese, the administration official said, might even deploy more than 200 warheads if the United States continues to expand its missile shield.</p>
        <p>China's expanded force of nuclear-tipped long-range missiles might not be directed at India, they say. But it would be a capability that the Indians could not ignore, and as a result India might build up the short-range missiles it used to defend against China.</p>
        <p>Administration officials are divided over whether India would respond in such a way, but the emerging analysis has dramatically raised the stakes.</p>
        <p>Seeking to balance its concerns over stability in South Asia with its interest in missile defense, the Clinton administration is likely to redouble its negotiating efforts with the Chinese and perhaps even explore new forms of arms control with Beijing. By all accounts, however, Washington has a difficult job ahead.</p>
        <p>''The basic point we have made is that a missile system is not aimed at them, that we are comfortable with deterrent relationship with China,'' a senior Clinton administration official said. ''But we have not been able to overcome their suspicions.''</p>
