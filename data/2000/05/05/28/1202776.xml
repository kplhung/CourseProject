        <p>Jenny Parilla's parents couldn't stop her from jumping on the furniture when she was 5, so they gave her trampoline lessons as a birthday present. Now the 19-year-old Californian, who still trains with the same coach she met on her first day at the gym, has a fair shot at an Olympic medal in Sydney this summer. She will be the only American representing her country in the new full-medal event of trampolining -- or ''bouncing,'' as it's called by enthusiasts.</p>
        <p>In a typical bounce, Parilla rockets upward from a 7-by-14-feet trampoline to a height of 20 feet; once aloft, she wills her 5-foot-2 form into the rapid-fire succession of pikes, twists and somersaults that accrue points for skill and grace. Like all elite female bouncers, she hovers for an exquisite second or two at the height of each trick, completing an entire 10-move routine in less than 30 seconds.</p>

        <p>Jenny Parilla's parents couldn't stop her from jumping on the furniture when she was 5, so they gave her trampoline lessons as a birthday present. Now the 19-year-old Californian, who still trains with the same coach she met on her first day at the gym, has a fair shot at an Olympic medal in Sydney this summer. She will be the only American representing her country in the new full-medal event of trampolining -- or ''bouncing,'' as it's called by enthusiasts.</p>
        <p>In a typical bounce, Parilla rockets upward from a 7-by-14-feet trampoline to a height of 20 feet; once aloft, she wills her 5-foot-2 form into the rapid-fire succession of pikes, twists and somersaults that accrue points for skill and grace. Like all elite female bouncers, she hovers for an exquisite second or two at the height of each trick, completing an entire 10-move routine in less than 30 seconds.</p>
        <p>Parilla, who is ranked fourth in the world, hopes to edge up to the Russian, German and Ukrainian bouncers currently ranked at the top by adding a difficult triple front somersault with half twist to her routine. The move, which Parilla has been performing only since April, is so dizzying that it makes the subsequent bounce difficult to execute.</p>
        <p>Unlike Parilla, bouncing itself has had some trouble getting off the ground in this country. In the 70's, insurance problems kept trampolines out of schools and gyms. ''There were very structured programs in Europe,'' says Parilla's coach, Robert Null. ''But it was less popular here.'' That may be why Parilla, who has never had an injury more serious than a sprained ankle, trains with 13- and 14-year-old junior hopefuls. She's one of the few veteran bouncers around.</p>
        <p>''This is going to go down in history,'' Parilla says of the Olympic competition. She hopes bouncing will become a crowd-pleaser in the tradition of gymnastics and figure skating -- the sort of television event that makes thousands of little girls beg for after-school lessons. ''The audience is gonna be in awe,'' she predicts. As dangerous as her routine looks to fans, however, what Parilla finds in midair is serenity. ''I've been doing this my whole life. I love the feeling of total freedom, that your body and gravity are the only two forces. It's the closest you'll ever get to flying.''</p>
