        <p>I haven't seen Rick Lazio this much since high school. Back then, he and I were in classes together in boring West Islip, N.Y. He was barely memorable, not a star athlete, scholar, artist, actor, surfer or class clown. He was simply decent in a way that makes you not want to give someone the time of day as a teenager. Now, of course, since he announced his race for the Senate in the West Islip High School gym last Sunday (''I'm no celebrity,'' he declared), the entire country knows who he is. And I'm not the only former classmate reminiscing about the lackluster impression he made back then.</p>
        <p>''If I have to listen to my parents sing the praises of Rick Lazio one more time, I'll vomit,'' said Judi Ford, a classmate and single mother from Westchester. ''My mother tells me, 'Listen, Miss Smarty Pants, when you're important enough to be on national TV, we'll ask for your opinion.' It drives me crazy because he was so unremarkable, and it makes me regret wasted opportunities in my own life.''</p>

        <p>I haven't seen Rick Lazio this much since high school. Back then, he and I were in classes together in boring West Islip, N.Y. He was barely memorable, not a star athlete, scholar, artist, actor, surfer or class clown. He was simply decent in a way that makes you not want to give someone the time of day as a teenager. Now, of course, since he announced his race for the Senate in the West Islip High School gym last Sunday (''I'm no celebrity,'' he declared), the entire country knows who he is. And I'm not the only former classmate reminiscing about the lackluster impression he made back then.</p>
        <p>''If I have to listen to my parents sing the praises of Rick Lazio one more time, I'll vomit,'' said Judi Ford, a classmate and single mother from Westchester. ''My mother tells me, 'Listen, Miss Smarty Pants, when you're important enough to be on national TV, we'll ask for your opinion.' It drives me crazy because he was so unremarkable, and it makes me regret wasted opportunities in my own life.''</p>
        <p>It's hard to know what to say to that. After all, where do brains and talent get you without ambition? And if Hollywood is high school with money, isn't Washington just high school for opportunists? Besides, since I've always seen West Islip as a fishpond of banality, maybe it's apt that Mr. Lazio has become its poster boy.</p>
        <p>Most of the former classmates I called last week, some of them Mr. Lazio's old buddies, recalled him as amiable, good at remembering names and not much more. Of course, it's not unusual to feel jealous or left behind when old faces achieve prominence and move into a social stratosphere.</p>
        <p>''I have no idea who he is,'' said Barbara Fasano, an award-winning cabaret singer and classmate still striving for fame in Manhattan. ''But then again, he looks just like the kind of guy I would ignore in high school anyway.''</p>
        <p>Is it possible to be a nobody and a somebody simultaneously? Is it even fair to recall as a nobody a somebody who has made a name for himself in Congress? And if Rick Lazio, who now has the attention of everyone from David Letterman to my Aunt Phyllis in Alabama (she called to crow about how articulate he was on television), is ''no celebrity,'' what does that make the rest of us squawking onlookers?</p>
        <p>On Friday, Mr. Lazio was working the Staten Island Ferry Terminal's morning rush hour. I went to see him. ''Say hello to your next senator,'' one of many tough-looking men in suits around him yelled at me and the commuters passing through turnstiles. A very high school-like alarm bell rang for each departing ferry.</p>
        <p>''Hi Rick, remember me?'' I said.</p>
        <p>''Sure I do, Bob,'' he said as he shook my hand.</p>
        <p>I did not say, ''Well that's good because I barely remember you.'' But after talking briefly about friends and teachers, I stepped back and watched him work the crowd, tucking his lean frame in to listen, touch arms, grip shoulders and pose with children of color for hovering photographers.</p>
        <p>''West Islip was a fairly monolithic community without much ethnic diversity,'' he told me when I asked if his years in our all-white, mostly Roman Catholic high school had prepared him for politics. ''But college at Vassar and law school and my career have made me more empathetic. I'm learning all the time.''</p>
        <p>O.K., he probably meant homogenous, not monolithic. Still he seemed to be trying hard, as I know he's done as a representative. A friend had told me that although Mr. Lazio wasn't a top honors student in our class, he showed a cheerful press-ahead quality, and I could see it now, as he worked wave after wave of rushing commuters. Surely, there are easier ways to make a living and a mark on the world.</p>
        <p>There were so many people around him that it was hard to have a conversation.</p>
        <p>''Were you this popular in high school?'' I asked. An absurd question. He laughed, and that's when I realized how little high school matters now, how we have to let go of it, adjust to what we've become and allow others their due. Even when they leave us squinting in their glare.</p>
