        <p>Tomasina Boyd, a daughter of Carlotta Heath of Manhattan and Charles Boyd of Aguadilla, P.R., is to be married today to Eric E. Boone, a son of Thelma Gay Boone and Milton Boone Jr. of Halifax, N.C. The Rev. Rafael Warnock, a Baptist minister, is to perform the ceremony at the Vizcaya Museum and Gardens in Miami.</p>
        <p>The bride, 29, is known as Tommy. She is an advertising director for the Mitchell Advertising Group in Manhattan, which represents ''Today's Black Woman'' and other magazines. She graduated from the State University College at Oswego, N.Y., and is a candidate for a master's degree in graphic communications at New York University. Her father is a municipal recreation director in Aguadilla. Her mother is a seamstress and a custom clothing designer in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boone, 26, is an associate in corporate finance at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp; McCloy, the New York law firm. He is counsel to the New York State Conference of N.A.A.C.P. Branches. He graduated from Wake Forest University and the New York University School of Law. His father, who is retired, was a customer service manager for General Electric on Long Island.</p>
        <p>The couple met over books. Mr. Boone decided to start a book club with his friend Kosha Brightwell. The group would gather over wine and cheese and discuss one book a month, but it had nowhere to meet. Ms. Brightwell asked Ms. Boyd, a sorority sister, if they could meet at her home in Brooklyn. She agreed.</p>
        <p>That was four years ago, and while Mr. Boone can't remember the book they discussed, he does remember what Ms. Boyd wore at the first meeting.</p>
        <p>''She had on a white cotton T-shirt with a V-neck and a pair of blue jeans,'' he said. ''And bare feet -- she had beautiful little feet.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Boyd, who has a clear recollection of the book (''Brothers and Sisters,'' by Bebe Moore Campbell), recalls thinking that Ms. Brightwell and Mr. Boone were dating.</p>
        <p>They weren't, she soon learned. Mr. Boone, however, had just gotten out of a relationship and was hesitant about beginning another. So they became friends, seeing each other once a month at the book club.</p>
        <p>But when the club took a break the first summer, Mr. Boone called her under the guise of talking about the club. A week later, she invited him to an advance screening of ''The Rich Man's Wife,'' starring Halle Berry.</p>
        <p>When they arrived, the screening room was crowded. ''We didn't even sit together at the movie,'' Ms. Boyd said. She ended up having Mr. Boone take a seat in front of her, but she didn't mind. ''I looked at him the whole time,'' she said.</p>
