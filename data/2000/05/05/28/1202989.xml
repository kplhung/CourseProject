        <p>To The Editor:</p>
        <p>Regarding the article about the Somers pool referendum [''In Somers, for Third Time, Debate Swirls Around a Pool Plan,'' May 14]:</p>
        <p>Before moving to Somers we lived in Mount Kisco. During the summer, the town pool complex was a wonderful community gathering place. The lack of a town pool in Somers almost kept us from moving here, but Somers' numerous other assets won us over.</p>
        <p>Here's why we support the pool: in a town as large, fragmented and spread out as Somers, it would tremendously strengthen the sense of community, especially since we don't have a traditional downtown or Main Street; for the growing number of children, the opportunities for recreation, friendship and wholesome activity speak for themselves. And it would likely enhance town property values, since it would be a draw for new residents.</p>
        <p>The plan for the pool is extremely thorough, fiscally sound and well thought out. The impact of the pool on our taxes would be negligible.</p>
        <p>A location next to Reis Park is obviously ideal -- and the pool has been planned in such a way that its effect on the surrounding area would be minimal.</p>
        <p>This is a critical referendum for the town -- it's probably our last chance to get a pool built in the foreseeable future.</p>
        <p>DIANE AND STEVE KARSCH  Somers</p>
