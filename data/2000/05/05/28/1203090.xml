      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says Russia's new president, Vladimir Putin, is starting his economic reform in right place, seeking to replace country's progressive but largely dysfunctional personal income tax with simple flat tax; says if Russia can get its tax system in order and Kremlin can begin to count on steady source of income for government programs, country can begin to deal with its chronic problems</p>

        <p>Though Russia's new president, Vladimir Putin, has yet to chart a clear course on most domestic fronts, he made clear last week that he intends to move aggressively to mend the economy, ending years of meandering policies. The Putin government asked parliament to replace the country's progressive but largely dysfunctional personal income tax with a simple flat tax. By radically simplifying the code and slashing rates, Mr. Putin hopes to raise collections by cutting down on the corruption that has left his government starving for revenue. If the plan works, Mr. Putin would not only have the money to provide badly needed public services, but also establish the credibility to push for further economic reforms.</p>
        <p>The government proposed to replace the current income tax, with rates ranging from 12 percent to 30 percent, with a code with just one rate, 13 percent. Many in the country, including the Communists, want to hold on to progressive rates. But in a society where few people pay anything close to their legally required taxes, and wealthy individuals often pay no tax, the idea of a progressive tax code is an illusion.</p>

        <p>Though Russia's new president, Vladimir Putin, has yet to chart a clear course on most domestic fronts, he made clear last week that he intends to move aggressively to mend the economy, ending years of meandering policies. The Putin government asked parliament to replace the country's progressive but largely dysfunctional personal income tax with a simple flat tax. By radically simplifying the code and slashing rates, Mr. Putin hopes to raise collections by cutting down on the corruption that has left his government starving for revenue. If the plan works, Mr. Putin would not only have the money to provide badly needed public services, but also establish the credibility to push for further economic reforms.</p>
        <p>The government proposed to replace the current income tax, with rates ranging from 12 percent to 30 percent, with a code with just one rate, 13 percent. Many in the country, including the Communists, want to hold on to progressive rates. But in a society where few people pay anything close to their legally required taxes, and wealthy individuals often pay no tax, the idea of a progressive tax code is an illusion.</p>
        <p>By cutting rates and simplifying the code, Mr. Putin hopes to encourage people to pay taxes and make it easier for the government to track down those who do not. If Mr. Putin has the will, a flat tax makes a crackdown feasible. A flat tax can also cut down political corruption, removing layers of subsidies in the code that officials like to shower on favored constituents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin is right that tax rates are too high. A destructive competition to raise revenue rages among Russia's local, regional and federal authorities. Each sets rates high before the other jurisdictions can do so. Indeed, local officials often help businesses hide their local tax payments so that local governments can avoid sharing the proceeds with Moscow as the law requires. Russia has created the worst of all tax worlds: high rates and little revenue.</p>
        <p>The government also announced other tax reforms, including eliminating a regressive, ineffective business tax and raising gasoline and tobacco taxes. Part of the motivation is economic reform. But the package of reforms, depending on the details, might also tilt tax collections toward sources that go primarily to Moscow and away from those that feed local and regional coffers. Mr. Putin is already engaged in a power struggle with regional governors, warning them that he intends to rein in their autonomy.</p>
        <p>It will not be easy to make the flat tax and other reforms work. Corruption and bureaucratic incompetence will not disappear overnight. But Mr. Putin is starting his economic reform in the right place. If Russia can get its tax system in order and the Kremlin can begin to count on a steady source of income for government programs, the country can at last begin to deal with some of its chronic problems, including a failing health care system, erratic law enforcement and the poverty of millions of elderly citizens.</p>
