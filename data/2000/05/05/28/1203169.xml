        <p>After decades of exclusion from all regional groups in the United Nations, Israel has been accepted on a temporary basis by the Western Europeans, ending its virtual disenfranchisement in the organization.</p>
        <p>Israel's ambassador to the United Nations called the long-sought invitation, issued on Friday, a turning point in his country's relations with the organization, where a voting bloc of Arab and third world nations has perennially attacked and isolated the Israelis in the General Assembly and other bodies.</p>
        <p>Only two nations, Israel and Estonia, have never belonged to one of the regional groups, formed 40 years ago to decide on candidates for many council and committee positions at the United Nations and its agencies and programs around the world.</p>
        <p>Estonia chose not to join the Eastern European group, holding out for membership in the Western European caucus, which also includes Australia, New Zealand, Canada and sometimes the United States. But Israel has been barred by Arab and other opposition from the Asian group, covering all nations from the eastern shores of the Mediterranean to the Pacific. Membership in the Asian group is still Israel's goal, diplomats say.</p>
        <p>The United States has been lobbying hard over the last year to get Israel into the Western Europe group. The decision was bumped from one level to another in the 15-member European Union for months before the Netherlands, which now holds the rotating chairmanship of the group at the United Nations, pressed for closure.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, American diplomats said, the Dutch ambassador to the United Nations, Peter van Walsum, circulated a letter to the group's members saying that if there were no objections raised by Friday, Israel would be invited to join the group, under certain conditions.</p>
        <p>One is that temporary membership will be extended initially for only four years, after which Israel's relationship with the group would be reviewed. Israel would also have to forgo seeking elected positions for two years. American officials say intense competition for contested posts was a major factor in keeping Israel out of the Western European group. Other positions in the United Nations system will be closed to Israel for longer periods because of past agreements. Israel must formally accept the limited invitation.</p>
        <p>There are five regional groups at the United Nations -- Western Europe, Eastern Europe, Asia, Africa and the Western Hemisphere, which covers Latin America and the Caribbean.</p>

        <p>U.N. Patrols Border</p>
        <p>FATIMA GATE, Lebanon, May 27 (Reuters) -- United Nations peacekeepers patrolled this border flash point between Israel and Lebanon today and pushed back Lebanese civilians trying to taunt Israeli soldiers across barbed wire.</p>
        <p>The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon sent four armored troop carriers and dozens of peacekeepers to Fatima Gate, the scene of daily gatherings by Lebanese since Israel pulled out of southern Lebanon this week. Hezbollah guerrillas moved into the border zone after Israeli forces withdrew.</p>
        <p>Today, the peacekeepers turned back Lebanese who were heading to the fence to jeer Israeli soldiers and wave Hezbollah flags at them.</p>
