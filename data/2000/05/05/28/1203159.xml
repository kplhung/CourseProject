        <p>Ousted Police Leader Awaits Day in Court</p>
        <p>Oral arguments may be heard as early as Friday in the reverse discrimination suit filed by Carl A. Williams, the former superintendent of the New Jersey State Police who was ousted after making public comments linking minority groups to drug crimes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams, who is white, was forced to resign in February 1999, the day remarks he made in an interview appeared in The Star-Ledger. In it, he said that some crimes were more routinely committed by certain racial and ethic groups. He was quoted as saying: ''It would be naive to think race is not an issue in drug trafficking,'' and ''Two weeks ago, the president of the United States went to Mexico to talk to the president of Mexico about drugs. He didn't go to Ireland. He didn't go to England. Today, with this drug problem, the drug problem is cocaine or marijuana. It is most likely a minority group that's involved with that.''</p>

        <p>Ousted Police Leader Awaits Day in Court</p>
        <p>Oral arguments may be heard as early as Friday in the reverse discrimination suit filed by Carl A. Williams, the former superintendent of the New Jersey State Police who was ousted after making public comments linking minority groups to drug crimes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Williams, who is white, was forced to resign in February 1999, the day remarks he made in an interview appeared in The Star-Ledger. In it, he said that some crimes were more routinely committed by certain racial and ethic groups. He was quoted as saying: ''It would be naive to think race is not an issue in drug trafficking,'' and ''Two weeks ago, the president of the United States went to Mexico to talk to the president of Mexico about drugs. He didn't go to Ireland. He didn't go to England. Today, with this drug problem, the drug problem is cocaine or marijuana. It is most likely a minority group that's involved with that.''</p>
        <p>At the time, state troopers were being criticized for ''racial profiling,'' pulling over citizens because of their race.</p>
        <p>In his suit against the state, Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and Peter G. Verniero, the former attorney general and a current State Supreme Court justice, Mr. Williams said that he was illegally discriminated against and wrongfully dismissed. ''He can only be fired for cause, with a notice and a hearing,'' said Clifford L. Van Syoc, Mr. Williams's lawyer. Mr. Van Syoc said Mr. Williams could not be interviewed now, because of the pending lawsuit. ''I think they're still suffering, but they're coming out of that,'' Mr. Van Syoc said of Mr. Williams and his wife, Eloise. ''They'd like to see our day in court. It will be very therapeutic.''</p>
        <p>Still Creating Magazines, But in Laid-Back Setting</p>
        <p>Clay Felker, the founding editor of New York magazine, who also edited The Village Voice, Esquire, Adweek and Manhattan inc., is still involved in creating magazines, though on a smaller scale and with a decidedly West Coast bent. In 1995, New York's guru of the four-color glossy moved to California to become the director of the Felker Magazine Center at the Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism. He now spends the academic year far from New York's ''sheer minute by minute excitement,'' which he says he misses.</p>
        <p>But he finds redeeming news value in the Bay Area. ''We're sitting on one of the most exciting stories in the world, the development of information technology,'' he said. His classes have produced magazines devoted entirely to women in Silicon Valley and the new gold rush in the high-tech community. The magazines have titles like Valley Girls, F (for female), Quake Town, and The Luddite (about the overhyping of information technology).</p>
        <p>In 1995, when Mr. Felker joined the journalism school, Tom Goldstein, then the dean, called him a ''natural nurturer of talent.'' Mr. Felker, who teaches writing and the fundamentals of magazine editing, has invited some of his friends to give guest lectures at the school.</p>
        <p>He complains about the lack of good writing in American magazines, though he admires some of the work in Time, The New Yorker and Texas Monthly. But despite being surrounded by cyberhype, he does not worry that magazines will shrivel away.</p>
        <p>''I feel that magazines are always momentary, contemporary reflections of the culture of the moment,'' he said. ''The context of events and impact of political and cultural trends has to be explained in more than a paragraph or a few headlines. It takes a well-written, expertly conceived-of and reported story to give you this context.''</p>
