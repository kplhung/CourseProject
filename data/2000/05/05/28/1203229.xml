        <p>Letter from Gloria Feldt, president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, says she, like Gov George W Bush, was raised in West Texas; says he opposes abortion while she is lifelong advocate of reproductive rights</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''A Philosophy With Roots in Conservative Texas Soil'' (front page, May 21): The environment that produced George W. Bush, the self-proclaimed ''most anti-abortion governor in the country,'' also shaped the views of the president of Planned Parenthood.</p>
        <p>I, too, was a child of 1950's West Texas. After high school near Midland, I went as a young bride to Odessa and spent 20 years in the same ''oil patch'' that your article calls the ''real America.'' Life options for women there were minimal.  No one talked to youth about sexuality or birth control. But we knew about illegal abortions and about women who died from them. I had three children by age 21.</p>

        <p>West Texas was a catalyst for my lifetime of advocacy for reproductive health and rights. Conversely, Mr. Bush's presidential agenda would take women back to the 1950's.</p>
