        <p>A matter of concern was arising, like smoke in the distance, in relation to Latrell Sprewell. It came in the guise of last quarters in the playoffs this season. The Knick forward, after generally fine first three quarters, had become mysteriously ineffective in the final 12 minutes, as though someone had swiped his can of spinach, or slipped chewing gum under his sneakers.</p>
        <p>The last-quarter nadir was reached in Thursday night's game when he failed to hit a basket in four tries and missed a short jump shot that could have tied the score against Indiana with five seconds left.</p>
        <p>After the Game 2 loss, Sprewell walked off the court with Larry Johnson, who had had a good game, and apologized.</p>
        <p>''We didn't give you enough help,'' Sprewell said. ''I didn't give you enough help.''</p>
        <p>Later, Sprewell said, with the candor that has contributed to his growing and unexpected appeal to New York fans: ''It's hard to believe. I picked an unfortunate time to have the worst playoff game of my life.''</p>
        <p>And yesterday things were looking dire, indeed, especially with Knicks center Patrick Ewing suited up only in gray double-breasted and ensconced at the end of the bench because of acute tendinitis in his right foot.</p>
        <p>''I have to go to the basket, and believe in my shot, and believe in myself,'' he said. ''Be aggressive, that's the bottom line. And I have to keep shooting. As a shooter, as a scorer, you always feel you're going to make the next shot.''</p>
        <p>His feelings, apparently, were hitting bull's-eyes. On his first try, he hit a jump shot for the Knicks' first basket of the game, and then hit another, and followed that with a 3-pointer. The Knicks were up, 11-5, and the sellout crowd was howling, as if word was out that they were going to share in the lottery.</p>
        <p>Sprewell's positive feelings were working overtime. He popped in three more jump shots in the second quarter, five more baskets in the third period. He had 23 points and the Knicks were up, 71-64.</p>
        <p>Now it was the fourth quarter, the tense time, when the game often hangs in the balance. Spree, as his teammates call him, was 4 for 31 in his last 10 playoff games, after scoring 13 of the team's last 17 points in Game 2 against Toronto and the game-winner over Vince Carter. Sprewell remains the team's leading scorer in the postseason with a 17.8 average, and was second to Allan Houston, 16.5 to 16.0, after the first two Pacers games.</p>
        <p>But now there is this odd case building against Sprewell, and it has nothing to do with his problems of a couple of years ago when his coach at the time, P. J. Carlesimo of Golden State, riled him and he took his anger into his own hands. It seems that Sprewell's overall fine play over the last two seasons with the Knicks, his team play, his good citizenship, have allowed people to forgive if not entirely forget the infamous throat throttle. Talk to Latrell Sprewell today and you get reasoned, sincere responses and a generosity of time and spirit. He has obviously lived and learned. He smiles, but without trying to be ingratiating. He has remained his own man, down to the cornrows. One comes away liking him.</p>
        <p>It's too much to believe that a veteran player like Sprewell, who has been counted on in the past to produce under pressure, could be buckling for some reason. Anything's possible, to be sure. The mind, as Freud deduced, is a wild and nutty contraption. Chuck Knoblauch suddenly can't throw to first base from second base. All the Miami players suddenly can't make free throws. The pretty girl falls for the homely guy.</p>
        <p>''The coaches want me to square up more on every shot,'' he said. ''They think I'm too often off balance. They believe that the chances of the balanced shot going down are up. But I've been shooting and making off-balance shots all my life.''</p>
        <p>The inference, however, is that he will be concentrating more on squaring up. Sprewell, after all, lives and learns.</p>
        <p>After Game 2, Sprewell said: ''I felt I had let the team down. But now I have to be concerned only with the next possession, the next quarter, the next game.''</p>
        <p>Now, with Marcus Camby lost to the Knicks after spraining his knee in the second quarter, it was up to the likes of Larry Johnson, Allan Houston, Charlie Ward, Kurt Thomas -- and, of course, Sprewell -- to protect the lead and keep them truly competitive in the series.</p>
        <p>Sprewell, apparently having wiped clean the memory of past fourth quarters from his consciousness, canned three straight shots from the field, added two free throws and then, virtually sealing the victory, sank an 18-foot jumper to give the Knicks their widest margin of the game, 91-79, with 2 minutes 25 seconds left in the game.</p>
        <p>In between, he played tough defense on Jalen Rose, pulled in a handful of rebounds and passed well, especially the one he laid in to Thomas under the basket for a score that should be framed and hung in the Metropolitan.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't surprised that we won,'' Sprewell said later. ''Larry, Allan and I knew we had to play our 'A' game, and if we did, we could win.''</p>
        <p>So they did, with Sprewell leading all scorers with 32 points.</p>
        <p>''I was so troubled after Game 2,'' Sprewell said, ''I couldn't sleep. I was tossing and turning all night. But when we win, I go right to sleep. Out.''</p>
        <p>An earthquake probably wouldn't have disturbed his sleep last night.</p>
