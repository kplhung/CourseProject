        <p>He launched the ball toward the Rose Garden rafters with as much relief as joy. In those desperate, final 29.9 seconds of Game 3 on Friday night, Kobe Bryant's amazingly clutch plays had swung the Western Conference finals in his team's favor and added a notch of maturity to his young career.</p>
        <p>His was a single-handed sequence that transcended the box score. Although seemingly impossible for the All-Star guard, Bryant played beyond his 21 years in the Lakers' 93-91 victory. These were not the raw, unpredictable playground instincts that have highlighted and hindered Bryant during his four seasons in the National Basketball Association. These were championship moments delivered when his team absolutely needed a leader to emerge. Bryant provided the early offensive spark, saved the Lakers with quick-thinking defense down the stretch and afterward called it the most satisfying victory of his career.</p>
        <p>''I'm just learning how to play in this as I go along,'' Bryant said today. ''This is the deepest I ever have been in the playoffs. This is new territory for me. We're getting stronger together, me as a player and us as a team.''</p>
        <p>His teammate Glen Rice said: ''He rose to the challenge big time. He realized he had to raise his game and give us a lift. Now, he has to maintain that level in order for us to have a chance.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, the Lakers benefited from the Portland Trail Blazers' inability to bury them after Portland had built a 14-point lead in the second quarter. The Lakers' rally included a 20-6 run in the third quarter and an 11-3 run to start the fourth quarter. They also outrebounded the Trail Blazers by 18-7 in the second half.</p>
        <p>''We were knuckleheads last night,'' Scottie Pippen said today. ''Mentally, we weren't out there. We made knucklehead mistakes. We should have made some easier plays. Instead, we tried to make tough ones.''</p>
        <p>Bryant made most of the important ones. First, he set up the game-winning basket, driving toward the middle to draw defenders his way, then flipping a pass to Ron Harper for an 18-foot jump shot that the Trail Blazers never had a chance to contest. ''It's growing as a basketball player to trust your teammates like that,'' Bryant said.</p>
        <p>On the Trail Blazers' next possession, as Rasheed Wallace took a pass and positioned himself near the free-throw line, Bryant slapped the ball away, creating a wild 20-second scramble that ended with Portland center Arvydas Sabonis lumbering down the lane. The 7-foot-3-inch Sabonis was met by the 6-7 Bryant, and with one swat, Bryant put the Lakers ahead, two games to one, in this four-of-seven-game series.</p>
        <p>An assist. A steal. A block. Fittingly, Bryant grabbed the last rebound, too, and was immediately met with a high-five from Shaquille O'Neal.</p>
        <p>''This is the first time since we've been together that we've had to lead a team together in the playoffs,'' Bryant said of O'Neal. ''We're up to the challenge. We're not going to let the team down, we're not going to let the fans down. We're going to give it our best.''</p>
        <p>Bryant assumed command of the Lakers with 25 points on 11-of-18 shooting, 7 rebounds and 7 assists to squelch whispers that the Trail Blazers were making him look like an ordinary player. In the first two games of this series, Bryant averaged only 12.5 points and was doing little to lift the burden on O'Neal.</p>
        <p>''I just decided to score,'' Bryant said. ''They can send one guy, two guys, three guys, it doesn't matter. You have to pick your spots. It's not something you can do for the full 48 minutes. But you have to make them pay at some point.''</p>
        <p>Bryant kept the Lakers from being blown out in the first half Friday night. He scored 14 of his team's 22 points in the first quarter and had 18 at halftime on 8-of-13 shooting while O'Neal was still trying to figure out how to get even a shot off against Portland's defense. O'Neal took only one shot in the first quarter and didn't score. At halftime, he had only 8 points and obviously needed help breaking loose from Sabonis and from Pippen and Wallace, who again roamed freely on defense, buzzing along the perimeter, then dropping down to harass O'Neal in a game of human bumper cars.</p>
        <p>''Kobe had a fantastic game,'' O'Neal said. ''Everybody was ragging on him, saying he was nine shots a game. He was more aggressive tonight, and his shots were falling.''</p>
        <p>Bryant, the N.B.A. defensive player of the year, also kept Pippen under wraps, holding the Blazers' leader to 12 points on 5-of-13 shooting. Bryant was assigned to guard Pippen for Game 3 in part because Glen Rice was still nursing a sore knee.</p>
