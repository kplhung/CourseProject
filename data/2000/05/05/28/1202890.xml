        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Herbert Muschamp attacks the Department of City Planning for ''crossing a decisive line'' and for setting up shop ''in the sphere of aesthetic preference'' [''Reaching for Power Over Streets and Sky,'' May 14]. He suggests that the reader is compelled to ask ''to what extent architecture is a protected form of speech.''</p>
        <p>Some background will be useful. Height limits were constitutionally adopted by Boston in 1910. New York City crossed the decisive line into aesthetics in 1916 when it adopted the country's first comprehensive zoning resolution, which contemplated wedding cake buildings, towers on a base and non-bonusable plazas.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Herbert Muschamp attacks the Department of City Planning for ''crossing a decisive line'' and for setting up shop ''in the sphere of aesthetic preference'' [''Reaching for Power Over Streets and Sky,'' May 14]. He suggests that the reader is compelled to ask ''to what extent architecture is a protected form of speech.''</p>
        <p>Some background will be useful. Height limits were constitutionally adopted by Boston in 1910. New York City crossed the decisive line into aesthetics in 1916 when it adopted the country's first comprehensive zoning resolution, which contemplated wedding cake buildings, towers on a base and non-bonusable plazas.</p>
        <p>The United States Supreme Court definitively ruled in 1953 in Berman v. Parke that ''it is within the power of the legislature to determine that the community should be beautiful as well as healthy, spacious as well as clean, well-balanced as well as carefully patrolled.''</p>
        <p>In 1961 the city comprehensively amended its zoning resolution to encourage further development of freestanding towers, open spaces and plazas, among other goals. In a democracy it is important to stay in touch with public values, and it is in that reformist spirit that the current Unified Bulk Program is being offered, as the latest across-the-board bulk revision of the 1961 regulation.</p>
