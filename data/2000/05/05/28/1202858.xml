        <p>REPORTEDLY $26 million has gone into the renovation of the guest rooms and facade of the Hotel Thayer, which claims to have ''changed everything but the river.''</p>
        <p>Considering the disrespect the once splendidly decorated dining hall has received, we suspect that given the opportunity, the renovators would have found a way to obliterate the hotel's beautiful view of the Hudson River as well.</p>
        <p>Built on the grounds of the United States Military Academy in 1926 to accommodate visiting dignitaries and other guests, the hotel recently started publicizing attractions in addition to football games, campus tours and its military museum. These have included an 18-hole golf course, some evening entertainments at the academy's theater and special weekend packages, with emphasis on river cruises, shopping centers, skiing and hiking opportunities, wineries and other golf courses and historic sites -- all nearby. Nevertheless, although the Hotel Thayer may be a nice place to visit, we would not want to eat here without some caveats. Usually a safe bet, salad might be skipped, even though it came with the entree. Both house and Caesar salads arrived under a flood of dressing.</p>
        <p>For a few dollars more, start with fresh asparagus vinaigrette, chilled and topped prettily with a dice of roasted red pepper. Although overly sauced in a puff pastry shell (vol au vent), wild mushrooms and oysters made a delectable match.</p>
        <p>Other openers had their flaws. Weighty onion and tomato flan was composed of a bit of custard and a great deal of thick pastry; and served on three slices of tomato and a dollop of pesto, slices of prosciutto, dry as cardboard, seemed ripped apart.</p>
        <p>On two tries seafood sampler was skimpy for the price ($11): two watery medium shrimp, a spoonful of crabmeat and a small strip of smoked salmon seemed lost on the plate.</p>
        <p>Grilled baby lamb chops -- buttery and succulent -- and miraculously juicy boneless Cornish hen, deliciously charred at the edges, made the best entree picks. But fatty duck and Chilean sea bass with an acrid tomato compote failed to make the cut.</p>
        <p>And the texture of filet mignon, rare but bloodless, was mushy and the meat, dry. Breaded grouper might have been plucked from a supermarket freezer. Potato and soggy squash came with every entree.</p>
        <p>Skip linzer torte and commercial-tasting cheesecake and chocolate cake for good old-fashioned strawberry shortcake, built nicely on a biscuit base. Coffee was undrinkable.</p>
        <p>We can't remember having had worse service. We received no welcome or farewell thanks. Moments after we were told there were no specials, another server recited several to a table nearby. Wine was poured to the brim of four glasses, the server looking disappointed when the bottle could not be emptied on one pass. Holding the tines, a server offered a fork. Detritus from meals at other tables remained uncleared.  Used butter plates and a basket of stale rolls were still on our table when we left. Dessert menus were soiled. These gaffes seemed less the fault of serving staff than of management, which failed to train dining room personnel.</p>
        <p>Dinner, including appetizer, house salad, entree and dessert, averages $33 without drinks, tax and tip.</p>
        <p>The military academy is at the southern tip of Orange County. From the Bear Mountain Bridge, take Route 9W north for about four miles and follow the signs to West Point.</p>
        <p>The Hotel Thayer  674 Thayer Road,  West Point. 446-4731.</p>
        <p>POOR</p>
        <p>ATMOSPHERE -- High ceilings, tall leaded windows and Hudson River views fail to sustain the old grandeur of the dining areas, once lovely with dark wood trim and delightful murals, but now -- ceiling, walls, trim -- all hidden under white paint. Dining terrace. Large, separate bar and lounge. Untrained service with no one in charge.</p>
