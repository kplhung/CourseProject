        <p>Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx Democratic Party chairman and one of the state's most influential behind-the-scenes political tacticians, said yesterday that he would not seek re-election to his seat in the Assembly this year.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mr. Ramirez said, he will remain as the borough's Democratic leader and work on the mayoral campaign of Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president. At the same time, he said, he would work to usher a new cadre of Hispanic and black officials into elected office in New York City and the state over the coming years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ramirez, 50, who has been in the Assembly for 10 years and the Democratic leader for 6, played a critical role in solidifying the leadership position of Sheldon Silver, the Assembly speaker who was the target of a rebellion within his chamber last week. Many members of the Legislature had expected that Mr. Ramirez would be selected as the Assembly's majority leader, replacing the second-ranking member, Michael J. Bragman, who organized the failed rebellion.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ramirez made clear that he had no plans to hold elective office in the near future. ''I cannot keep the county together politically when I have to travel between Albany and the Bronx every week,'' Mr. Ramirez said in an interview yesterday.</p>
        <p>''I want to be part of a process that reconstructs the political landscape for the city and the state,'' he said. ''I will not be in elective office for the next two years. I will do my job to elect other people.''</p>
        <p>In the last year, Mr. Ramirez has pursued stronger ties to two black political figures: H. Carl McCall, the state comptroller, and the Rev. Al Sharpton. He has also made the election of Mr. Ferrer, one of his closest political allies, a central mission of his leadership.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ramirez's decision is already causing some reconstruction of politics in the Bronx. He said that he had asked his longtime political mentor, Councilman Jose Rivera, to run for the Assembly seat he is vacating, and that the councilman had agreed.</p>
        <p>For most of a year, Mr. Rivera has been pursuing a race for Bronx borough president in 2001. Like many other City Council members in the Bronx and throughout the city, Mr. Rivera is banned by term-limit laws from seeking re-election to his seat. But his candidacy has met objections from Bronx Democratic politicians who criticize him for having a style considered too folksy and unpolished.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Rivera said he was inclined to run for the Assembly seat. ''I have mixed feelings,'' he said, ''but I think I will do it because I have always been a strong supporter of Roberto Ramirez and what he is trying to do.'' If Mr. Rivera moves to the Assembly from the City Council, the change will have no effect on his campaign for borough president, he added.</p>
        <p>Precisely what Mr. Ramirez's political impact will be is difficult to determine. He said he would devote more time to raising money and assisting a number of candidates for citywide and statewide office, including the anticipated gubernatorial race of Mr. McCall in 2002. He also intends to play a role in the selection of the next City Council speaker, who will be elected by the Council in the beginning of 2002.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ramirez represents the Kingsbridge, University Heights and Fordham sections of the Bronx in the Assembly. In his years at the helm of the Bronx Democratic organization, he has achieved a degree of party discipline unusual in the Bronx in recent years. His organization has kept the number of intraparty primary battles to a minimum, raised substantial amounts of money and delivered solid Democratic results in general elections.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the Assemblyman has been harshly criticized for creating obstacles for insurgent candidates and for running the borough's Democratic organization with little tolerance for open competition.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ramirez's announcement caught virtually all of his colleagues in Democratic politics by surprise. He said he had announced his decision earlier yesterday to a group of Democratic officials at a hastily called meeting at the party's headquarters in the Westchester Square area. He also spoke about his decision by phone with Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Democratic candidate for the United States Senate, and with Senator Charles E. Schumer.</p>
