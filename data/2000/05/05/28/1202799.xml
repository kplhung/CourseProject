        <p>HANGING upside down, I'm suspended in a translucent green world. As I hope for rescue, my hands stroke the sides of my kayak and I hold my breath for what seems an eternity. I'm vaguely aware of the pressure of the current sweeping me downstream.</p>
        <p>It briefly occurs to me that this is a weird way to travel.</p>
        <p>For almost four decades I've been hiking in the mountains that surround California's Salmon River, but my path has always been either perpendicular or parallel to the rushing waters that flow from the snowfields in the wilderness high above. Now I'm learning how to travel on the river itself.</p>
        <p>This is my first day at Otter Bar Lodge, which I had been told was one of the nation's premier white-water kayaking schools, deep in the Klamath National Forest along the Salmon. With my wife, Leslie, and 12 other mostly novice paddlers, I have come to Otter Bar for an intense week of river running and remarkably good food.</p>
        <p>At the moment, however, I'm thinking that I might have done just as well exploring water sports somewhere else (Maui comes to mind). I've been tripped up and rolled over by an eddy line on the edge of what some people might call a Class II rapid -- if they're being kind. I'm bouncing downstream upside down and backward. A large boulder raps me firmly on the back of my helmet to remind me of my predicament. A moment later, there is another knock. The nose of my instructor's boat is bumping my kayak's hull. I eagerly grasp it and roll myself upgright. Only my ego has been damaged.</p>
        <p>Otter Bar clearly isn't for everyone. But if you are looking for something more adventuresome than guided tours of Maya ruins or Greyhound Bus-sized rafting trips on the other Salmon River (in Idaho), this introduction to river kayaking offers an adrenalizing alternative.</p>
        <p>We reach Otter Bar on a July evening more than two hours after leaving the I-5 freeway near the California-Oregon border. If you drive from San Francisco, it is an almost-eight-hour excursion, about as far away from California's growing urban sprawl as you can get. You can also reach the lodge by flying to Eureka, Calif., and being driven to the lodge in a van.</p>
        <p>Surrounded by the Klamath National Forest, Otter Bar is tucked between two of California's most remote mountain regions: the Trinity Alps and Marble Mountains Wilderness Areas. These mountains are the state's hidden jewels. Although not as high as the Sierras, they are dotted with alpine lakes that feed the Salmon, Trinity and Klamath Rivers.</p>
        <p>It is remarkably rugged country, once the summer hunting and fishing grounds for Native Americans and more recently a refuge for loggers, gold miners and pot growers. The Klamath region today is the least populated part of California.</p>
        <p>The pristine main lodge at Otter Bar, a sprawling ranch with a comfortable dining room, a large living room with a stone fireplace and four bedrooms, is set back from a bend in the river on an immaculately manicured rolling lawn and is surrounded by smaller cabins. The complex is adjacent to two ponds where aspiring kayakers practice their rolls.</p>
        <p>After arriving, we settle in the single upstairs room, a kind of crow's nest with a sweeping view of both the forest and the river. The room is simple but comfortable, with lots of light and a shared bathroom at the foot of the stairs. Other guests have rooms in the lodge or in three cabins, each with their own bath.</p>
        <p>At dinner -- at which there was plenty of well-prepared food and wine -- we meet Peter and Kristy Sturges, the lodge's owners. Peter, the son of an old Rhode Island family, made his way to Northern California in 1971 and became a fishing guide on the Klamath River. Kristy grew up in Los Angeles and went to college in Santa Cruz. After graduating, she took a teaching job in the nearby hamlet of Somes Bar.</p>
        <p>In 1981, Peter purchased the land on which he built Otter Bar from the leader of a small religious cult who believed that the land was the center of the earth. Originally, Otter Bar was to be a back-country retreat featuring mountain biking, kayaking and hiking, but it is so remote that it ultimately required a special activity to attract visitors. ''It's so hard to get here that we found that we needed a magnet to draw people here, and ultimately that was kayaking,'' Peter said.</p>
        <p>Our class is mostly male and mostly in our 30's and 40's. Dale, however, an environmental engineer from Crescent City, Calif., says he is ''39 years and 297 months old.'' As the week goes on, he impresses everyone with his endurance and tenacity.</p>
        <p>At dinner, we also meet our four instructors. The two senior instructors, Peter and Creek, strike me as philosophical opposites in the world of adventure sports.</p>
        <p>Peter Kettering has an international reputation as a kayaker and splits each year between a kayaking school in New Zealand and Otter Bar. ''I never have winter,'' he says.</p>
        <p>A native of the Lower East Side of Manhattan, Peter was a construction manager in the United States when he left it behind more than a decade ago for a life of kayaking and rock climbing. He brings a bit of the precision of his past construction life to adventure sports.</p>
        <p>After breakfast each morning, the day begins with a chalk talk in front of the Otter Bar fireplace. One morning, Peter sketches out a model for understanding risk in outdoor sports that he has borrowed from a Canadian professor. He explains that for him, an adventure is an activity with no certain outcome. Taken to extreme, he adds, an adventure can end in a disaster.</p>
        <p>It's easy to contemplate such ideas from the comfort of an easy chair. For me, it becomes more problematic in the middle of a rapid heading toward a large rock wall while trying to remember which knee to use to keep my edge up.</p>
        <p>WHAT our time at Otter Bar will help us discover is where the boundaries are and how far out of our comfort zone we're willing to push. ''Poor judgment leads to bad experience,'' he says, ''and bad experience leads to good judgment.''</p>
        <p>If Peter exposes us to a sports philosophy, Creek (his last name appears to have been lost back in the 1960's), shares a very clear philosophy of life. It is Creek's pronouncement on our first day that sets the tone for me at Otter Bar. ''A perfect roll is the equivalent of the Zen koan about the sound of one hand clapping,'' he intones.</p>
        <p>Creek is as close as you can come to being a true Jedi river master. One morning, as we put our kayaks in the river directly in front of the lodge, I notice that there is a small Deadhead sticker on the back of Creek's kayaking helmet. He's an absolute joy -- a philosopher as much as Peter is a technical master. ''This is about life,'' Creek says shortly after we set out on the river one morning.</p>
        <p>Discharged from the army in 1967, Creek became an activist and then a Digger -- a member of a communal San Francisco group that flowered in the Haight-Ashbury. From there, he moved to the edge of the Trinity-Marble wilderness and joined the Black Bear commune almost 30 years ago.</p>
        <p>Many of the original Black Bear members returned to the city, but Creek stayed on. Now he drives a school bus for the tiny Forks of Salmon school district and the local ambulance, and teaches kayaking.</p>
        <p>Each morning begins with an incredible breakfast. French toast, pancakes, German pancakes, souffles and omelets all appear on the menu.</p>
        <p>After the first day, which we spend in a pond trying to learn to roll, each morning we head to the river in small groups, each with an instructor. Our basic equipment includes neoprene booties, a life vest, a Capilene shirt, a waterproof nylon paddling jacket, a helmet, nose plugs and a kayaking paddle. We would generally spend the entire day with our initial group, having lunch together on the river.</p>
        <p>An Eskimo roll is a crucial part of kayaking, making it possible after being turned over by the current or a wave to right yourself without leaving the boat. A roll is executed while underwater and upside down. The kayaker leans forward, and with paddle out of the water, sweeps the paddle across the surface of the water and snaps the hips. If done correctly, the kayak rights itself elegantly.</p>
        <p>The Salmon River runs through a winding canyon. In some places, there are steep rock walls hundreds of feet high. Elsewhere, the forest comes right to the water's edge. There are deep pools that separate rapids where the river plunges quickly. Otter Bar itself is on a broad elbow in the river where it flows around a open stretch of land surrounded by forest. The territory is striking and wild.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, our fourth day, we go around two bends in the river and after we enter a wide deep pool of slow-moving water, it's time to roll. When my turn comes, I submerge into the aquamarine world and examine my paddle blades above my head. I position my blades and roll half way up and then splash! Back down. One more time and this time, for reasons I can't fathom, I pop out of the water and give a whoop.</p>
        <p>Finally! I've joined the fraternity. Unfortunately, it's hardly a ''combat roll,'' made in the thick of a churning river.</p>
        <p>The rest of the day has its ups and downs. We slide through the Salmon, catching eddies, ferrying back and forth across rapids to make sure we can hold our angles and performing the sweep-to-stern draw paddle stroke, used to guide our boats precisely.</p>
        <p>The mantra that is drilled into us over and over again is ''angle, speed, edge,'' and when you do it right, your plastic boat seems to disappear, in tune with the water.</p>
        <p>Our days are almost exclusively devoted to kayaking. We have one afternoon off; some people go mountain biking, others hike in the mountains near the lodge.</p>
        <p>Evening activities usually involve reading and going immediately to sleep. Everyone is exhausted after a day on the river. The weather is warm but not hot. It can however, get really hot, which makes being on the river wonderful.</p>
        <p>Peter tells us on Thursday morning that we are now ''consciously incompetent'' kayakers, but with practice we will become ''consciously competent.'' Of course, the art form is to become ''unconsciously competent.''</p>
        <p>The language of kayaking is almost as much fun as paddling itself. We learn to ''peel out'' into rapids by holding a boat edge up into the current and letting the river sweep us down stream. Conversely, if you really want to show you have no river class at all, you can ''slime'' your way into the current by just letting your boat drift down stream.</p>
        <p>I manage to dump only once on Wednesday, when I trip across an eddy line and Creek is there almost instantly to perform an Eskimo rescue -- in which the upside-down kayaker grabs the rescuer's bow and rights himself -- which is just as well, because I've managed to lose my paddle.</p>
        <p>About six of the students excel, and head off after the fourth day for an outing in Class III rapids. The rest of us manage, more or less. Only one chooses to adopt an easier open kayak, which takes away the fear of rolling over. Dale, the oldest of us, does great, but never masters the roll.</p>
        <p>On our final day on the river, the Otter Bar vans rumble through downtown Forks of Salmon, which is little more than a post office and several buildings. A warm morning wind is blowing up the river canyon. We put in just above the confluence of the North and South Forks of the Salmon.</p>
        <p>It is our longest day on the river, lasting almost until 6 in the evening with only a short lunch break. I'm getting it, but more than once I find myself upside down watching the river rocks pass underneath me.</p>
        <p>I'm teased because I haven't developed a correct boating posture. I tend to lie back in my boat, Creek says, a little as if I think I'm riding a Harley. To me, it seems more like a slouch that would be appropriate for a roller-coaster ride. The correct posture, of course, is to sit more upright.</p>
        <p>On the seventh day, our last, I choose to spend another hour on the pond hoping that my roll will become automatic. It doesn't. An Eskimo roll in a kayak is one of the most counterintuitive things I've ever attempted.</p>
        <p>Half the time it seems that the reptilian part of my brain takes over and I end up halfway up gasping for air like a drowning fish. But then every once in a while, as they say, you get shown the light. It's the oddest feeling. There is no tension at all, just a set of linked movements and then I'm right side up.</p>
        <p>This time, Peter is the philosopher. Kayakers have a way of describing that feeling, he says. They call it ''grace under pressure.''</p>
        <p>In the wild</p>
        <p>Otter Bar Lodge is in the Klamath National Forest, between the Trinity Alps and the Marble Mountain Wilderness Areas in Northern California. The lodge is on the banks of the Salmon River, about halfway between Eureka, on the coast, and Yreka, inland on Interstate 5.</p>
        <p>One can drive to Otter Bar; it's eight hours from San Francisco. Those flying into the Arcata-Eureka Airport can be picked up for the two-and-a-half-hour trip to the lodge.</p>
        <p>All Otter Bar kayaking courses, offered from April 18 through Sept. 24, last seven days. Each session, limited to 14 students, is focused for either advanced, intermediate, basic intermediate or beginner levels.</p>
        <p>Regardless of level, the cost is $1,690 a person, and includes three meals a day, lodging and instruction. Children 10 to 14 can attend two sessions, in July and August, for $650, or $750 if a parent isn't a student.</p>
        <p>The lodge provides kayaks, paddles and related gear. Students must bring wetsuits, booties and other personal items.</p>
        <p>Dinners at the lodge feature fresh fish and Mexican, Asian and Italian dishes. Wine is served at dinner but there is no bar.</p>
