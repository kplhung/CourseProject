        <p>Northern Ireland's largest Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, voted today by a narrow margin to return to a power-sharing administration with their Catholic rivals in Sinn Fein, the political representatives of the Irish Republican Army.</p>
        <p>The outcome meant that governing of the province, which had been shifted back to London reluctantly in February, will revert to Belfast within days, and that the continually imperiled Northern Ireland peace accord will have survived another precarious lapse.</p>
        <p>A motion that was deliberately drafted to be a vote on the Unionists' leader, David Trimble, won the support of 53 percent of the 862 delegates of the party's ruling council. Mr. Trimble, under attack by a growing number of hard-liners, had said the balloting would not be a ''back me or sack me'' vote, but the wording of today's resolution asked simply whether people did or did not support ''the leader.''</p>
        <p>''It is perfectly obvious, as you can see, that we have stretched ourselves remarkably,'' Mr. Trimble said at a news conference.</p>
        <p>He had waged a strenuous campaign to overcome resistance in his party, and told reporters, ''It is obvious there are limits to how much more we can be stretched.''</p>
        <p>He also recalled the disappointment last November, when he won his party's support for agreeing to joint rule with Sinn Fein the first time. That government was suspended by Britain after only nine weeks, when the I.R.A. failed to respond with expected moves to begin disarming.</p>
        <p>''We have operated in reliance on promises made by the republican movement, and let there be absolutely no doubt this time that my colleagues and I will hold the republican movement to the promises they made,'' he said.</p>
        <p>On May 6, the I.R.A. pledged to permit inspections of its secret arms supplies and to ''completely and verifiably'' put its arms ''beyond use.'' Its earlier failure to address disarmament had blocked progress in realizing the provisions of the peace settlement of April 1998.</p>
        <p>The growing opposition in Mr. Trimble's own party, bolstered by the hard-line Democratic Unionists led by the Rev. Ian Paisley, mounted a challenge that obliged Mr. Trimble to postpone the meeting, originally scheduled last Saturday, to today.</p>
        <p>Hours after this afternoon's vote, the British Northern Ireland secretary, Peter Mandelson, signed the order to restore home rule. The 10-man cabinet is to meet on Thursday, and the first session of the Northern Ireland Assembly is set for June 5.</p>
        <p>More than 3,600 people have died in the last three decades of sectarian violence. The 1998 accord is an effort to balance the interests of pro-British Protestants and pro-Irish Catholics and turn their dispute from a violent one into a political one.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trimble today said he expected to see action ''within weeks'' on the I.R.A.'s pledge to open its hidden arsenals to inspection by two monitors, the former Finnish President, Martti Ahtisaari, and the former general secretary of the African National Congress, Cyril Ramaphosa.</p>
        <p>They said they would visit arms caches to verify that weapons are locked away and disassembled, and would report to John De Chastelain of Canada, a retired general and head of an international commission overseeing the disarmament.</p>
        <p>In the last two weeks, there has been fevered campaigning by Trimble supporters and opponents. Across the province there were door-to-door visits, saturation telephone canvassing and leafleting. Some party members from farm areas complained of the aggressive tactics of the anti-agreement campaigners and said they preferred the quiet persuasion of Mr. Trimble.</p>
        <p>In an emotional appeal to the delegates at the closed meeting today, Mr. Trimble warned that a ''No'' vote would consign the party to the political wilderness and turn the province over to republicans and nationalists.</p>
        <p>The anti-agreement faction, unable to base its opposition solely on the arms issue once the I.R.A. had made its new offer, broadened its demands by focusing on cherished symbols of national identity: Whether the British or Irish flag flies above government buildings, and what name and insignia the police force bears. Particularly sensitive is the matter of what to call the Royal Ulster Constabulary, which is 93 percent Protestant and enjoys little trust from Catholics.</p>
        <p>An international commission headed by Chris Patten, the former governor of Hong Kong, recommended a new force with more balanced recruitment and the name Northern Ireland Police Service, but the hard-liners insisted that the R.U.C. title -- whose reference to ''Royal'' denotes allegiance to the United Kingdom -- be kept.</p>
        <p>The Unionists, who are largely Protestant, want to see Ulster remain part of Britain, while the republicans, or nationalists, who are mostly Catholic, ultimately want to be part of Ireland.</p>
        <p>Secretary Mandelson tried to help Mr. Trimble's cause by saying that he would keep the R.U.C. name in the incorporation deeds of the new force; he also promised other refinements to the Patten report to meet Unionist objections.</p>
        <p>Britain's concessions to Mr. Trimble on these points has cost the current support of the Sinn Fein, whose president, Gerry Adams, said he could no longer recommend the formation of the new police force to his members. It is a crucial consideration for the future, because whatever the new service is called, it will not be effective unless it can attract Catholics and start to redress the imbalance in its members.</p>
        <p>[In New York on Saturday, Mr. Adams told a crowd of supporters that while the I.R.A. would honor its commitment to the power-sharing agreement approved by the Unionists, the onus was on the British government to keep its promises as well.</p>
        <p>[He said the British government had a clear obligation to provide for equal recruitment of Catholics into a new police force. ''There's no ambiguity about it at all,'' he added. ''I think Mr. Blair knows precisely what he has to do.'']</p>
        <p>Polling by Belfast newspapers showed the membership of the Ulster Unionists at the district level to be more accepting of political coexistence with Catholics than the membership of the ruling council. Mr. Trimble has said he plans reforms to do away with bloc votes on the council held by a militant youth wing and the traditional Orange Order, who have sided with the hardliners. Today's personal endorsement should enable him to act.</p>
        <p>The rejectionists' challenge gained strength this time because it was led openly by Mr. Trimble's most forceful opponent in the party, Jeffrey Donaldson, 37, a member of Parliament who has coveted Mr. Trimble's leadership position. But today the delegates did not warm to his criticisms of Mr. Trimble, and persuaded him to withdraw an amendment proposing an alternative plan.</p>
        <p>The final tally showed that Mr. Trimble lost the support of some people who had voted with him in the past, but also picked up backing in surprising places.</p>
        <p>Sean O'Callaghan, a convicted former I.R.A. killer who is the guerrilla army's highest-ranking defector, came forward to tell Unionist gatherings this past week that he was convinced that the I.R.A.'s new promises on arms constituted the long-awaited pledge from the republican side that ''the war is over.''</p>
