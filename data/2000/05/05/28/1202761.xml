        <p>WHAT'S NOT TO LOVE?</p>
        <p>The Adventures of a Mildly Perverted Young Writer.</p>
        <p>By Jonathan Ames.</p>
        <p>Crown, $23.</p>
        <p>In his hilarious column City Slicker, in the weekly newspaper The New York Press, Jonathan Ames has displayed an unusual ability to take crack-smoking, balding and Oedipal fixation and whip them up into an elegant, comic meringue. His collection, ''What's Not to Love?,'' can be jarring with its sex-obsessed panoply of penises and breasts. But his lapidary prose style rapidly seduces the reader into taking his pleasures with him. Some of the original versions of characters and events from Ames's fiction show up, and the differences are revealing. He allows himself little of the hope and romance that he grants his fictional characters in his novel, ''The Extra Man'' (1998). Some of the humor in ''What's Not to Love?'' seems designed for a live audience or for a harried commuter, and evaporates after being consumed, whereas ''The Extra Man'' stayed with you. But there is also a light beauty to the ephemeral, a beauty Ames conjures up in countless joyous scatological and ejaculatory moments.</p>
