        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Grace Glueck's article on Charles Schwartz and his camera obscura [''East Side Co-op, Park Views, Includes Camera,'' May 7] includes an informative overview of the history of this medium, and notes a growing interest in it. In fact, the camera obscura work of two contemporary artists, Vera Lutter and Rodney Graham, is on view in ''Time Traced,'' an exhibition at Dia Center for the Arts, through June 18. Mr. Graham's ingenious camera obscura carriage on the roof of Dia's building in Chelsea is set up to demonstrate the pin-hole principle of image-making. Included in the exhibition is Ms. Lutter's 14-foot-long, exquisitely poetic vision of the iconic PepsiCo sign, a signature over the Long Island City waterfront. The photograph is one of a series made with the camera obscura she built by hand with her own resources in 1998 on the roof of the Pepsi-Cola bottling factory.</p>
