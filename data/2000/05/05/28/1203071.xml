        <p>Mildred Gregorio rises at 5:45 every morning. After showering and dressing, she trudges to the Pelham Parkway stop of the No. 5 (Dyre Avenue) train, fights for a seat and settles down for the 90-minute ride to her office near City Hall, where she works as a secretary to a judge.</p>
        <p>The trip is long. Like thousands of other commuters from the northeastern Bronx who work in Manhattan, Ms. Gregorio is glad that her train runs express between 180th Street and 149th Street during the rush hours.</p>
        <p>But to the dismay of her and her fellow travelers, the M.T.A. has announced plans to have the train make all local stops in the Bronx during those hours.</p>
        <p>Commuters and transit advocates contend that the change, which will add seven stops, will make an already long ride 15 to 20 minutes longer and aggravate overcrowding on trains.</p>
        <p>''People are so angry about this,''  Ms. Gregorio said. ''The commute is already so long and so crowded.''</p>
        <p>In the two weeks since the plan was announced, Assemblyman Jeffrey Klein, whose district covers the Pelham Parkway area, collected more than 2,000 signatures on petitions protesting the change.</p>
        <p>M.T.A. officials say the change will  help prevent delays all along the No. 5 line. Keeping the Dyre Avenue train on a local track, they say, will prevent bottlenecks involving the No. 2 train, which also switches to express tracks at 180th Street.</p>
        <p>But this reasoning does not satisfy commuters and transit advocates.</p>
        <p>''I disagree with their reasoning strongly,'' said Andrew Albert, chairman of the New York City Transit Riders Council, which advises the M.T.A. ''This is clearly about convenience from Transit's point of view.''</p>
        <p>The opposition appears to have given the M.T.A. pause. Two days after Mr. Klein delivered his petitions to the agency, it announced a one-month delay in its plan.</p>
        <p>''We have won one battle,'' Mr. Klein said on Thursday. ''But we have to keep getting more signatures and let the M.T.A. know that Bronx commuters will not tolerate this.''</p>
