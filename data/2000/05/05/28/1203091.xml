        <p>I GREW up in a family where ''remote controle'' meant the person closest to the television set, so my current status as a satellite TV subscriber is as oxymoronic as a Web site called Luddite.com.

        <p>I GREW up in a family where ''remote controle'' meant the person closest to the television set, so my current status as a satellite TV subscriber is as oxymoronic as a Web site called Luddite.com. It was just too tough to resist the advertised offerings of this new technology - from sharper picture to expanded channel choices to superior sports coverage - that have already lured more than 12 million subscribers nationally.</p>
        <p>I signed up in January. And now, hundreds of ESPN Classic hours later, I'd have to rank that decision right up there with a handful of other life-altering choices. Like getting married. Television is no longer something I watch when I have time to kill. It has become a participatory activity.</p>
        <p>First I had to decide between the two primary providers, DirecTV and the Dish Network - a technological dilemma not unlike the old eight-track versus cassette quandary, because selecting one forces you to purchase equipment that exludes you from the other. (In the end, a special offer from DirecTV giving me two months of free movie channels tipped the balance.) Then came a steroid-enhanced version of TV Guide, geared to satellite users, that begged to be read like a novel.</p>
        <p>Too bad there is so much new television to get to, I no longer have time for books.</p>
        <p>Besides, who needs print? The satellite system comes with an on-screen channel guide. Click a button and a listing of everything playing for the next two hours on every one of the 200-plus channels starts scrolling by. Of course, watching this endless stream of events can also be time-consuming, especially since you can click on the guide to see any show at any time, so I often treat it as a game. Last week, for instance, I decided to click only on every third channel, no matter what it was. That took me about two hours, which is not bad, except that the hours were between midnight and 2 a.m. and did not include my customary detours via the Info button, a handy device that offers a complete description of any scheduled program in a banner across the top of the screen. You know that frustration you feel watching an old movie, unable to remember what year you first saw it and the name of the actor playing the buddy cop? The Info button makes sure that will never happen again.</p>
        <p>My system features everything from up to 55 pay-per-view movie channels (only 4 of which, surprisingly, are devoted to soft-core pornography) to 23 regional sports channels from around the country and 31 music channels, each of which provides a nonstop stream of tunes, from classic rock to contemporary Christian. Perhaps that's why I now watch television the way I listen to music in my car, constantly hopping from one state to another out of the irrational fear that focusing too long on one means missing something good on another.</p>
        <p>Sometimes an entire evening can go by without my really watching anything. If I'm not wavering between channels, I might get lost playing with my Turbo Tune, an instant path to nine favorite channels. And I can't resist Watchword, which lets me choose a word, like ''doctor,'' and call up every show that has it in the title. I've also enjoyed countless minutes checking out the satellite e-mail alerting me to special events, and I can't wait until the end of the year, when an option allowing me to download an actor's biography or a ballplayer's statistics while watching him or her in a movie or a game should be available.</p>
        <p>What fascinates me most, though, are the informational channels (nearly a dozen) about the service itself - offering everything from the definition of transponder (part of the dish) to shows on which people chat about all the shows available on satellite. It's a medium collapsing upon itself, television about television, and I'm hopelessly hooked on every minute.</p>
        <p>Friends tell me I should be more critical of something that is really just a new and more complicated way to watch ''Walker, Taxas Ranger'' reruns, and I'm sure I soon will be. Right now, thought, I'm taking great comfort (and not a small amount of pride) in having figured out a way to watch the All-News Channel in German.</p>
