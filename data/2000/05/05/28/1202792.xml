        <p>Polls are wonderful for many things, including gauging reactions to events. But they are poor windows onto the complexities and ambiguities of public opinion. If you want to know what's on the minds of Americans, you ought to engage them in conversation that would give them a chance to do more than select from among canned answers to rigidly structured and limited questions.</p>

        <p>Polls are wonderful for many things, including gauging reactions to events. But they are poor windows onto the complexities and ambiguities of public opinion. If you want to know what's on the minds of Americans, you ought to engage them in conversation that would give them a chance to do more than select from among canned answers to rigidly structured and limited questions.</p>
        <p>You introduce your special issue by saying that it</p>
        <p>is about change -- that it ''surveys the transformations of our habits</p>
        <p>of heart and mind.'' In fact, the least productive way</p>
        <p>to try to understand change is through a survey. Too bad that so many in the news media have become producers of polls rather than reporters of public opinion.</p>
