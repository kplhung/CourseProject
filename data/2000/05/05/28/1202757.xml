        <p>Reporting Vietnam: American Journalism, 1959-1975  Library of America, $17.95.</p>
        <p>This collection, culled from two larger volumes of writing about the Vietnam War, includes the work of correspondents as diverse as Hunter S. Thompson, David Halberstam, Michael Herr and Doris Kearns, and is mainly concerned with the campaign waged in the field, not the one at home. The pages are filled with ''pain, anger, sadness, failure and the despair that accompanies the recognition that suffering will never be redeemed,'' Thomas Powers wrote here in 1999 of the two-volume edition. A Dangerous Friend, by Ward Just (Houghton Mifflin, $13), is a novel set in Vietnam in 1965. Its protagonist is a well-meaning American aid worker whose efforts to do ''more good than harm'' run astray when he tries to foster his moral and political values in a land vastly different from his own. ''Just has a veteran war reporter's eye for the telling detail,'' James McManus said here last year. ''He succeeds in evoking the dense, tactile weave of life in country.''</p>
        <p>The First World War  By John Keegan. Vintage, $16.</p>
        <p>The eminent British military historian demystifies World War I by conveying the feelings of the participants and explaining how it started, how it was waged, why the Allies won and its far-reaching significance for the century. His account, selected by the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 1999, ''is elegantly written, clear, detailed and omniscient,'' Tony Judt wrote in these pages. ''As a narrative it is outstanding.'' The Pity of War, by Niall Ferguson (Basic Books, $17), takes a contrarian view of the war's causes, maintaining that had Britain kept out, the Germans would have won but the world would have been spared much of the grief that followed 1918. Last year our reviewer, V. R. Berghahn, called this ''an illuminating synthesis of current knowledge'' with ''plenty of fresh information and challenging ideas on the conflict's most important aspects.'' In The Great War and Modern Memory, by Paul Fussell (Oxford University, $14.95), which won a National Book Award when it was first published in 1975, the war is portrayed as a profound cultural event that in its carnage spelled the end of innocence and reshaped the modern imagination. Frank Kermode wrote here that the result is a ''skillful and compassionate'' study of the war and ''an important contribution to our understanding of how we came to make it part of our minds.'' Verdun, by Jules Romains (Prion, $17.95), is a fictional re-creation of the battle in 1916 in which more than 500,000 Germans and French were killed or wounded. ''Through the minds of a skillfully chosen group of soldiers, officers and fighting units, we see both the general character and the momentary progress'' of the clash, Gilbert Highet said here in 1939. ''The composition of this battle piece is one of the greatest technical achievements in the history of the novel.''</p>
        <p>Hitler. 1889-1936: Hubris  By Ian Kershaw. Norton, $21.95.</p>
        <p>In chronicling Hitler's remarkable rise from obscurity, a history professor tries to explain how Germany came to embrace the leadership of a social outcast and beer hall agitator. ''Kershaw successfully illuminates the strange and at times ecstatic dance in which Hitler and Germany engaged,'' Walter Reich wrote here in 1999. He ''is able to clarify, perhaps better than any biographer who preceded him, what made Hitler's dictatorial power possible.'' The Cruel Sea, by Nicholas Monsarrat (Burford, $18.95), is a 1951 novel about combat in the North Atlantic between British escort forces and Nazi U-boats. ''Its vivid action scenes, survival episodes and smooth writing sustain the book at a high level of excitement,'' W. J. Lederer said in these pages. Village of a Million Spirits: A Novel of the Treblinka Uprising, by Ian MacMillan (Penguin, $12.95), is a harrowing account of the daily operations of the infamous Treblinka concentration camp in Poland, and the 1943 revolt by hundreds of Jewish prisoners. The ''shifting tableaux of horror and helplessness in the camp are devastating,'' Zofia Smardz wrote here last year.</p>
        <p>Breakout: The Chosin Reservoir Campaign, Korea 1950  By Martin Russ. Penguin, $14.95.</p>
        <p>In November 1950, Chinese forces opened an attack on American troops in North Korea, ending Gen. Douglas MacArthur's ''home by Christmas'' offensive and setting the stage for a brilliantly executed withdrawal operation by three surrounded Marine units. This ''engrossing account'' of the campaign relies on the ''vivid, at times powerful'' recollections of ground-level combatants, Ronald H. Spector said here last year.</p>
        <p>November 1916: The Red Wheel/Knot II  By Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.  Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $17.</p>
        <p>This huge, overstuffed novel is set during the Great War in the months just before the Bolshevik Revolution, when ordinary Russians were beginning to feel that the old system had let them down. Solzhenitsyn ''achieves something exceedingly rare among novelists dealing with history,'' John Bayley wrote here last year. ''He makes the reader realize that anything can happen at any time.'' The same publisher has reissued the opening volume in the author's historical cycle, August 1914: The Red Wheel/Knot I ($25), a close study of the military fiascos of imperial Russia as witnessed by several groups of characters. In 1989 in these pages, Irving Howe found this to be a flawed work but said there are ''some good pages'' nonetheless.</p>
