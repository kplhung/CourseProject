        <p>This 30-second commercial, titled ''Wall Street,'' was released by the Camden County Democratic Committee, which has endorsed former Gov. Jim Florio in his bid for the Democratic Senate nomination in New Jersey against Jon S. Corzine. It is a classic ''soft money'' ad, in that it does not explicitly advocate voting for or against anyone. The commercial began running on Wednesday on television stations in New York City.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Murphy Putnam Media.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- New York's financial district -- introduced with the caption ''Greed is good'' -- is made to look as sinister and intimidating as possible. Photographed looking up from street level, through a blue filter, the New York Stock Exchange and other imposing Wall Street buildings roll by. An unflattering photo of a squinting Mr. Corzine takes up one corner of the frame, as printed warnings sidle across the screen: ''$250 Million Penalty for Raiding Pension Funds.'' ''Supports Republican Plan to Privatize Social Security.'' ''Good for Goldman Sachs, Bad for Seniors.'' The commercial ends with the admonition to ''Tell Jon Corzine to Leave Our Retirement Funds Alone,'' along with the phone number of Mr. Corzine's campaign headquarters.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Narrator: ''Wall Street. A place where some say greed is good. A place Jon Corzine feels right at home. When he was chairman of Goldman Sachs, the firm paid a $250 million penalty for raiding employee pension funds. Now, Jon Corzine supports the Republican plan to privatize Social Security. Good for Goldman Sachs. Bad for seniors. Raiding pensions and privatizing Social Security. Tell Jon Corzine to leave our retirement funds alone.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- As Mr. Florio has done less artfully in his own ads, this commercial flatly misrepresents Mr. Corzine's position on Social Security. In fact, it brazenly cites as a source a Business Week article that actually makes clear Mr. Corzine's opposition to individual investment accounts, the heart of the Republican plan. Goldman Sachs did pay $253 million in 1995 to settle charges that it had conspired with Robert Maxwell, the British publishing magnate, to defraud pensioners of hundreds of millions of dollars. It is debatable whether a settlement of a lawsuit, under which Goldman did not admit wrongdoing, amounts to a ''penalty.''</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- Mr. Florio's campaign, which began running $900,000 worth of commercials on Wednesday, is now essentially out of money, and the former governor's friends in Camden County, his political base, have done him a tremendous favor by buying $500,000 in television time to run this commercial. Conveniently, because it does not explicitly urge voters to back Mr. Florio or reject Mr. Corzine, the ad can be paid for with soft money, which has much larger individual contribution limits. The ad is arguably more effective than any of Mr. Corzine's attack ads and is as polished as his positive ones. It manages to paint Mr. Corzine as a pension robber out to cheat the elderly, and a New Yorker running for office in New Jersey -- all in an economical half-minute.</p>
