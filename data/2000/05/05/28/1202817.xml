        <p>I REMEMBER a time, learning about jazz, when I was thrilled by a musician stepping up to take a solo. It struck me then that the solo was a vector of musical truth and insight, and all the other stuff around it was just set-up, material that could be learned quickly.</p>

        <p>I REMEMBER a time, learning about jazz, when I was thrilled by a musician stepping up to take a solo. It struck me then that the solo was a vector of musical truth and insight, and all the other stuff around it was just set-up, material that could be learned quickly.</p>
        <p>''Improvisation is the ultimate human endowment,'' wrote the scholar Albert Murray, concluding ''The Hero and the Blues,'' an essay on American literature that showed how the best art came directly from a people's survival tactics. Mr. Murray adeptly connected jazz to great fiction, and this line of thinking excited me back then: I felt that one had to be all ears at the threshold of each solo -- for this was where a musician could be ''read,'' where native genius would spring out of him and be ready for measurement.</p>
        <p>I think that I, like many other people, came to understand soloing roughly to be the same thing as ''improvisation,'' as Mr. Murray intended it. In fact, the former is a subset of the latter. Improvisation is the mindset, the impulse; the solo is one product of that impulse. You can be a very improvisatory musician, especially rhythmically, without taking a lot of big, spotlighted solos.</p>
        <p>Now, more often than not, I brace myself at that moment when all members of a group simmer down to accompany a solo from a frontline musician. Because it often means that I'm going to hear not just one solo, but a bunch of them. They may be long, far longer than they need to be. They may seem like place-fillers for what could be stronger, shorter, more memorable music. By the end of the tune, I'm often left wondering how it is that solos -- and especially that theme-solos-theme format -- became such a necessary part of jazz. Not everybody solos particularly well, after all, and the number of bona fide stars whom you'd always want to hear solo, because you identify with them, is at an all-time low. Sometimes -- too often -- solos make listening to jazz drudgework yet are nevertheless applauded, when the real strength of the piece lay in some other part of it.</p>
        <p>The solo is certainly the primary symbol of jazz to the outside world -- a rail-splitting statement made within a rail-splitting music. In the history of jazz scholarship, solos have been taken as the highest mode of assertion; there are more analyses of solos than those of rhythm sections, for example, and they're much better-known pieces of criticism. And most of the great heroes of the music have been powerhouse soloists. Jazz solos first grew into special moments, things of art, in the early 1920's, and they may have reached their peak in the 1960's when John Coltrane's 15-minute performance on ''Chasin' the Trane'' made him an icon. Now, some of the best jazz has pressed the solo back into the context of written music or made it an ongoing collective endeavor throughout a piece of music, thereby lessening its iconic stature. In the huge volume of jazz to be presented in New York during next month's jazz festivals, we will be sure to see both an effusion of the old style, for nostalgia's sake, as well a good dose of the new.</p>
        <p>I started to think about this shift a few years ago when I noticed that some of the great performances of current jazz that I saw didn't seem to be about solos anymore. One of two things generally happened to make the music sound fresh: either the entire band seemed to be improvising all together, with emphases on one musician or another, controlled by the bandleader, or the music had become heavily arranged. Those arrangements were new to bandstands; that arranging impulse had largely dropped out of small-group jazz from the 1960's to the 1980's, and via the influence of composers ranging from Wynton Marsalis to Henry Threadgill, it was coming back.</p>
        <p>Improvisation is always a relative term. The jazz ensemble retains the spirit of improvisation, even if much of the material is notated or known by heart; and in the realm of rhythmic improvisation, there is much that the jazz musician can do by making small free-hand inscriptions on the walls of a predetermined tune. In early jazz, the solo began as a deeply woven part of the ensemble -- little variations that amounted to embellishments of the written line. By the 1920's, the notion was expanded, but the best solos were still worked out in advance; there's a reason why King Oliver's 32-bar solo in his 1923 ''Dipper Mouth Blues,'' with its stubborn variations on a handful of blues phrases, sounds so authoritative and why Bubber Miley's solo on the 1927 RCA Victor version of Ellington's ''Black and Tan Fantasy'' holds your attention from the first sly, four-bar long-tone to the last bouquet of wahs and growls. But you can't charge these performances with sounding canned: they are mirrors of the best creative acts, and even though they are no doubt shaped by practice, the urgency within them isn't faked. They're beautiful diversions: they take the listener away from the piece, then return him to it.</p>
        <p>Jazz reached a high point in the 50's: it was widely understood both as art music and as entertainment. The jazz musician loomed larger -- in popular movies and novels, on the cover of Time magazine and, thanks to Norman Granz's Jazz at the Philharmonic tours, concert halls. Jazz at the Philharmonic enshrined the jam session, the loose-limbed aggregation of players running through well-known tunes, for a large audience. Naturally, when the jazz musician's casual hours turned official, solos got longer.</p>
        <p>In some instances, they got even better -- more rattling, more immediate. The blues form helped musicians find themselves in three memorable solos: Sonny Rollins's ''Blue Seven,'' Paul Gonsalves's ''Diminuendo and Crescendo in Blue'' and Coltrane's ''Chasin' the Trane.'' ''Chasin the Trane,'' in 1961, proved a solo could sound gloriously unplanned, as if the musician were actually leaving the present tense and going into the subconscious, where the narrative of time didn't matter; Coltrane's only preserved remarks about the tune's recorded version are to the effect that he was surprised by how long it was. In the early 1970's, musicians like Roscoe Mitchell and Lester Bowie took the process one step further, lampooning well-worn gestures of the blues and bebop language and sometimes even the very idea of solos; Mr. Mitchell has played solos of nothing but one pitch or one phrase, repeated over and over.</p>
        <p>Of course, that wasn't the end of the jazz solo. But it was around that time that the myth of the jazz musician started to be deflated. Now, the figure of the jazz musician is even more modest. Instead of some sort of tortured, celebrated loner, he's frequently merely a scholar, and in an age when the cause of jazz education has been hotly taken up, he's understood for what he is: a hard-working artist whose parents encouraged a rather esoteric desire through years of private lessons and music school. The myth is leaving, and the audience credulity it takes to absorb endless solos from the bandstand is leaving too.</p>
        <p>When Herbie Hancock played material from his ''Gershwin's World'' album at the Blue Note last month, it was a performance not about solos, not even about melodies, but about rhythm and interplay. Dave Holland, performing at Birdland in early May, presided over intricate bursts of form, often anchored by persistent vamps; when a musician did take a solo, it was big and commanding and statuesque, and not simply one in a series of rote pirouettes. The pianist Jason Moran's forthcoming record, ''Facing Left,'' presents a rattling set of pieces in which all three musicians seem to be soloing simultaneously, and improvisation largely hangs off the repeated melody. The wilder side of jazz has been making adjustments, too: groups like Tim Berne's Bloodcount and Peter Brotzmann's Tentet use arrangements that continually recombine members of the group, keeping the emphasis away from strings of solos and leaning toward shifting duets or three-way improvisations.</p>
        <p>There are exceptions, of course -- musicians whose lengthy improvisations are to be savored: Keith Jarrett, Joe Lovano, Dewey Redman, Lee Konitz, Marcus Roberts and Wynton Marsalis, for instance, all have superior senses of improvised form.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Roberts's last album, ''In Honor of Duke,'' is jazz trio music so schematically worked out that it leaves little to chance. Jazz records in general are turning toward more closely arranged projects; the 50's notion of the ''blowing date'' record is more passe than ever, replaced by recordings like Mr. Lovano's new ''52nd Street Themes,'' featuring meticulous arrangements for a 10-piece band, or Greg Osby's ''Invisible Hand,'' which manages by clever forethought to corral Jim Hall and Andrew Hill, two musicians whom you'd never think of putting together on the bandstand for a few ad-libbed choruses. Such albums are not only easier to market -- there's often a story and something of an aesthetic argument behind them -- but they're often more engaging to listen to than informal affairs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marsalis, recently asked in Jazz Times magazine what he thought the future of jazz held, said: ''I think there's going to be an end to the old style of jamming on the bandstand that was really initiated during Charlie Parker's time. Historically, that was never a part of jazz music, not in the beginning . . . solos didn't come into fashion until Louis Armstrong and didn't become ingrained into jazz until the bebop thing came along. So I think there will be more emphasis put on presentation and composition as opposed to just soloing, which is really a boring and predictable way of presenting music.''</p>
        <p>If Mr. Marsalis, who spends a great deal of time concerned with jazz education, is thinking along the lines of building something that will last -- a jazz literature for the future, rather than just a few exploding minutes of genius in a B-flat blues -- he's not the only one. It only takes a look at the schedules of the Bell Atlantic and JVC festivals this year to know that the music, across the board, is deep in its compositional phase. But this time composition doesn't just mean old repertory; it means new music that can survive, as written, into the future.</p>
