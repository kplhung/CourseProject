        <p>Left For Dead</p>
        <p>My Journey Home From Everest.</p>
        <p>By Beck Weathers</p>
        <p>with Stephen G. Michaud.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 292 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Villard. $24.95.</p>
        <p>The nation's first glimpse of Seaborn Beck Weathers, survivor of the notorious 1996 Everest expeditions, was a pathetic sight: bandaged mitts for hands, blackened cheeks and an overcooked marshmallow of a nose, all from severe frostbite. What happened? we wanted to know. Jon Krakauer, in his acclaimed book ''Into Thin Air,'' complained of Weathers's ''sketchy'' skills, his novice's choice of footwear, even his right-wing politics; Weathers, who'd paid $65,000, became the poster boy for everything wrong with guided climbs.</p>
        <p>Now Weathers takes his turn. In ''Left for Dead,'' written with Stephen G. Michaud, Weathers proves an easy raconteur, relating the trek, his recovery and, unfortunately, a tedious autobiography. While he doesn't dispute Krakauer's account, he feels lucky, not guilty, for being granted a chance to re-evaluate his life. In fact, despite losing his right hand and most of his left, he says he'd do it again.</p>
        <p>It's an astonishing claim. On Mount Everest, this 49-year-old pathologist from Dallas waited 10 hours for the guide Rob Hall to lead him back to camp after his eyesight failed. (Hall would perish near the summit.) Another guide helped Weathers down until a whiteout pinned them to the mountain. By the time the storm abated, Weathers was deemed too far gone to save. He slipped into a coma. Incredibly, 22 hours after the storm had struck, he awoke to a vision of his family, and centering on that image, he found his way back. Placed in a tent and wrapped in sleeping bags, he was expected to die within hours. Beating the odds once more, he was later well enough to hike down to a point where a helicopter could rescue him.</p>
        <p>In addition to practicing medicine, Weathers is now a motivational speaker, which may explain his folksy storytelling style. Krakauer called him ''garrulous.'' Weathers agrees: ''I could have talked the ears off a rubber rabbit.'' He spells out the high-altitude dangers clearly. Navigating the treacherous ladders of the shifting Khumbu Icefall, he writes, is like being ''an ant trapped in the bottom of an ice machine.'' Above 25,000 feet, he explains, ''you're consuming your own tissue -- about three pounds of muscle a day -- in order to stay alive.''</p>
        <p>Weathers's recovery involved more than rebuilding muscle mass. But depend on a guy who called his motorcycle Scarlett O'Honda to recount the excruciating period with humor. His ''dead puppets'' (his hands) were amputated, save for his left palm and the nub of his left thumb. To shape the new hand, the doctor ''needed a little extra skin, which he took from my crotch -- without asking.'' His ''misshapen muffin'' of a nose had to be replaced with one that was cultivated on his forehead. Weathers's candid descriptions of his ''postdigital world'' are moving, his upbeat attitude perhaps yielding the biggest clue about how he got home from Everest.</p>
        <p>WHEN Weathers tells his personal history, his voice loses its thrill. His was a life marked by a demanding career, periodic depression and a crumbling marriage. Interspersed with tales of his mountaineering escapades are passages in which his wife, Peach, testifies bitterly about being neglected. For example (and there are many), she learned of the Everest trip when a friend congratulated her husband on making the cut. One wonders if the book's title doubles for her feelings about the marriage.</p>
        <p>That medicine and climbing estranged him from his family is regrettable, but it makes for a cliched chapter in an otherwise engaging memoir. Beck Weathers owes his fame to an experience that nearly killed him -- this is what readers are curious about. On that score at least, he delivers.</p>
