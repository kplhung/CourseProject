        <p>RON BROWN</p>
        <p>An Uncommon Life.</p>
        <p>By Steven A. Holmes.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 316 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>John Wiley &amp; Sons. $24.95.</p>
        <p>It can be hard going, but this is a book worth sticking with. The disparate elements of ''Ron Brown: An Uncommon Life'' add up to a balanced portrait of a talented, driven, flawed man with an insatiable appetite for money, publicity and powerful women he wasn't married to.</p>
        <p>By and large, Steven A. Holmes, a Washington correspondent for The New York Times, leaves it to the reader to run the sums on Brown, who was killed in April 1996 at 54, on a deal-making trip as commerce secretary, when his Air Force Boeing 737 crashed in the Balkans. Holmes's writing ranges from plodding to razor sharp. His three-page sketch of Paul Tully, the best political strategist ever, is a gem. But in frequent patches, his book reads as if it had been pasted together by committee -- one unsupervised by an editor. It's difficult to shake off the mawkish prologue, describing the scene at a black church in the capital, where the high and the mighty (among them the ''raspy-voiced'' Charles Rangel and Edward M. Kennedy, with ''his round, ruddy face'') are paying their respects to the late commerce secretary. Regrettably, the more plodding portions include the description of Brown's ancestors making their way northward out of the post-Civil War South and gradually establishing themselves as well-educated members of an emerging black middle class.</p>
        <p>The yarn of the ''little prince who could do no wrong'' -- spending much of his youth roaming the halls of the Hotel Theresa, the hangout for Harlem's high society, which his father, Bill, a confirmed gambler and philanderer, was hired to manage after World War II -- is by now familiar. But at 5, Ron began commuting daily from ''the fabled capital of Negro America'' to exclusive white schools, requiring him to lead ''a racially schizophrenic existence,'' Holmes writes, but one that taught him ''to sharpen his instincts for survival, to cultivate people and, no doubt, to be what he would become later in life, a true crossover man.'' Probably not off the mark, but too many of Brown's presumably character-forming years are accounted for by best guesses (what Brown, who throughout his life rarely displayed much emotion, must have seen and so on) and dry page-fillers on New York City's black upper crust at play.</p>
        <p>After picking up an undergraduate degree from Middlebury College, slogging through a tour in the Army and enduring several yawn-inducing years on the staff of the Urban League (where he landed with the help of his well-connected mother), Brown in July 1973 was named head of the league's Washington office. He's off and running -- and so, finally, is Holmes. ''As the second in command of a thriving civil rights group, Brown represented a fresh face, new ideas and a sense of dynamic young leadership at a time of dramatic change in the nation's capital,'' he says. As they almost always would, carefully nurtured acquaintances came through when Brown was ready for a change. In December 1979, he joined Ted Kennedy's challenge to President Jimmy Carter as deputy campaign manager (though his real job, initially, was getting out the black vote). Kennedy made a shambles of the nominating convention and helped make Carter a former president. But Brown had a good war; he was mostly responsible for Kennedy's against-all-odds victories in the New York and California primaries.</p>
        <p>A few months later, Kennedy placed a call on his behalf and suddenly Brown was a partner in the high-powered Washington law and lobbying firm that is currently Patton Boggs, then as now a prosperous shop with a simple rule for screening clients: all comers welcome as long as their checks clear. In 1983, Brown agreed to look after the interests of Haiti and its despot of the moment, Jean-Claude Duvalier. ''Hey, he pays his bills,'' Brown would joke.</p>
        <p>Shortly before the Democrats' 1988 convention, Brown was called in to keep Jesse Jackson from doing a Kennedy. He pulled it off, further enhancing his reputation as a make-no-enemies guy to give the tough ones to. And always the quick study, Brown immediately identified a major cause of the subsequent Dukakis fiasco -- zero cooperation between the Democratic National Committee and the candidate. Not long thereafter, after mounting a full-bore charm offensive, he was elected chairman of the committee, becoming, Holmes says, the first person of color to head a major party in a Western democracy. It was not his first first. Brown had been the first black to run a state campaign (for Kennedy); there were no black partners at Patton Boggs when he signed on; he would later be the highest-ranking black in the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>At the national committee, he was, as always, interested in the perks. ''Are there any clubs you get to join?'' he asked the departing chairman. But before the next presidential election, he would reorganize the party in ways that would put Bill Clinton in the Oval Office. He also engaged in private business dealings that could have led to his undoing. Brown, ever searching for campaign money, established links with Asian-American sources of cash, links that figured in the party's questionable 1996 fund-raising and are to this day the subject of an on-again-off-again Justice Department inquiry.</p>
        <p>ONCE Clinton was sworn in, Brown was near the front of the line for a cabinet post. He wanted State; he had to make do with Commerce. There, his chief priority was helping American corporations pin down overseas contracts. He began organizing junkets to faraway places so the American business executives who accompanied him could press their cases in person. (Coincidentally, the White House insists, many of those executives subsequently made large donations to the party.) Brown also used the offshore jaunts to show off his international schmoozing skills. Even as he was starring in a scandal story a day, he still wanted State.</p>
        <p>As he's hammering in the last nail, Holmes raises an inevitable ''what if'': had Brown lived, would he have faced criminal charges? Maybe, but it probably wouldn't have mattered, he concludes; a Washington jury would have been highly unlikely to convict a black man of Brown's stature. But surely even if he had been sent off to a federal white-collar country club for a year or so, it wouldn't have mattered; these days, ex-felons are back in The Game in the time it takes to sear a double sirloin at the Palm.</p>
