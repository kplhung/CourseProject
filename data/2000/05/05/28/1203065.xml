        <p>MY PARENTS have long told me their stories of growing up during the Great Depression. I heard how my dad delivered groceries for a dollar a week and how his family ate meat once a week with the leftovers stretched, thinner and thinner, into the next few meals.</p>
        <p>For my father, James, 76, especially, the Great Depression has had a lasting effect. He's eating much better now, but he refuses to put his money into any investment where he isn't guaranteed to get his principal back.</p>
        <p>He's not stuffing money into mattresses, but his insistence on safety has meant he has sat out the bull market. Several of them, actually. My lectures on the dangers of inflation and the historical return of the stock market have not had as much effect on him as those sparse chicken dinners. He puts his money almost exclusively in certificates of deposit and savings bonds, and that's that. The man will just not listen to me.</p>
        <p>''Dad,'' I say, ''don't put all your money into C.D.'s. Diversify. Try some mutual funds.''</p>
        <p>''Too risky,'' he says. ''I wouldn't be able to sleep at night.''</p>
        <p>The sleep indicator is as important to my father's generation as the G.D.P. is to mine. We get frustrated seeing our parents' life savings invested at 6 percent, but they expect to sleep very soundly when it comes to their money. Although our parents are very fond of us, often those feelings don't run deep enough to take investment advice from their reckless children.</p>
        <p>Giovanni S. Testa, 43, of Livingston, N.J., said he has tried for years to get his father, Marino, 75, also of Livingston, to invest more wisely, but to no avail.</p>
        <p>''With stocks, my father thinks he'll lose all of it,'' he said. ''I try to explain risk to him, but he didn't understand it. Forgetaboutit. It was like talking to a wall, talking to my father.''</p>
        <p>Richard J. Nemec, 54, of Hinckley, Ohio, never could get through to his father, but he understood why.</p>
        <p>''He tended to be quite nearsighted and ultraconservative,'' Mr. Nemec said. ''Let's face it, when a man has gone through the Depression and World War II and then lived in a nice suburb, he gets very comfortable with his station in life. My father was a blue-collar worker and money came hard. He didn't want to take a chance on losing it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Nemec's father died in 1992, and his mother, Lillian, 79, was more open to change. He had her meet with his planner, Paul A. Hrisko.</p>
        <p>''It was a big change for her and she asked an awful lot of questions,'' said Mr. Hrisko, a certified financial planner who owns Paul Hrisko &amp; Associates in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. ''Is it safe? Is it guaranteed? What are my chances of losing my money? It didn't take one meeting. I had to come back several times. She was a bit nervous. The more I discussed it with her, the more she was willing to take the next step to a more aggressive portfolio.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hrisko said children must explain the investments, and their risks, fully and clearly. Children should also help their parents clarify their goals to determine how much risk is acceptable: is the money for them, their children or their grandchildren? The key, Mr. Hrisko said, is the parent must trust the child.</p>
        <p>The senior Mr. Testa moved slowly into mutual funds after his son persuaded him to see an investment adviser and he saw how diversification could keep his risk low but increase his return. Gail Rosen, 41, of Martinsville, N.Y., talked to her father for years about leaving savings bonds behind. He resisted at first, but he trusted her enough to move some money into mutual funds. Now he's hooked.</p>
        <p>''My dad has a computer and watches his funds online,'' said Ms. Rosen, an accountant. ''Now he tells me how I'm doing on my investments. He's so addicted that my mother hates it that he's on the computer all the time. Like some wives lose their husbands to golf, she's lost him to the computer.''</p>
        <p>HER father, Irving Horowitz, 72, of Monroe Township, N.J., said he changed after his daughter showed him how much money he was losing to inflation and taxes.</p>
        <p>''She's an accountant, so I listened,'' he said, eventually moving money into funds and individual stocks. ''Since I retired, I have made a hobby of it.''</p>
        <p>My father's hobby is his garden. And keeping his principal safe. I know his greatest concern is not for his children or his grandchildren, but for my mother, Mary. He wants to leave her secure and comfortable if anything happens to him. If his principal is safe, he knows she will be, too.</p>
        <p>He could have a better strategy, but that's not a bad one. It's a heartfelt plan that this son is going to stop arguing with.</p>
