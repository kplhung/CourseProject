        <p>BETWEEN Rocky Hill and Hartford there is a time warp and it is called Old Wethersfield. Founded in 1634 as Connecticut's first permanent English settlement, Wethersfield was described as the state's ''most auncient'' town by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut in 1650.</p>
        <p>''It's a town of pristine preservation with the largest historic district in the state,'' said Brenda Milkofsky, director of the Wethersfield Historical Society. ''Unlike Williamsburg and Sturbridge, which are recreated communities, Wethersfield is an authentic landscape.''</p>

        <p>BETWEEN Rocky Hill and Hartford there is a time warp and it is called Old Wethersfield. Founded in 1634 as Connecticut's first permanent English settlement, Wethersfield was described as the state's ''most auncient'' town by the General Court of the Colony of Connecticut in 1650.</p>
        <p>''It's a town of pristine preservation with the largest historic district in the state,'' said Brenda Milkofsky, director of the Wethersfield Historical Society. ''Unlike Williamsburg and Sturbridge, which are recreated communities, Wethersfield is an authentic landscape.''</p>
        <p>The approximately two-mile rectangular strip called Old Wethersfield (listed on the National Register of Historic Places) offers visitors an easy way to lose themselves without getting lost.</p>
        <p>A get-acquainted drive past old houses, farms, barns and warehouses, about 150 predating 1850 is an easy way to begin; then visitors can simply walk the short distances. Wethersfield has a rich vocabulary of architecture ranging from early English style to suburban houses built at the turn of the century.</p>
        <p>A logical first stop along the tree-lined brick walks is the Wethersfield Museum in the Keeny Memorial Cultural Center, built of local brown brick and stone in 1893 with splashing front fountain. It is a place to relax on new benches, pick up pamphlets, learn about walking tours and view an orientation exhibit. ''Legendary People, Ordinary Lives'' offers an overview of the town's architecture, furnishings and prominent residents as well as its early economy, which was rooted in maritime and agricultural industries. (For those with children in tow, there is a special guide to help them.)</p>
        <p>One driving loop can take motorists up Broad Street and back down Main, past the Broad Street Village Green, mariners' and merchants' homes of various vintages and one of two early farms still in operation. The Anderson Farm, circa 1837, with weathered wagon in front announces flowers as well as produce in season.</p>
        <p>Cove Warehouse, a 17th-century post and beam warehouse at the north end of Main Street, sits on a lonely crest overlooking the water. If visitors push open a shutter-like window they can be transported to the middle of the 1600's, when vessels were being built in the area and the harbor, now called the cove, was a center for shipping animals, flax, seed and the region's major crop, red onions, to places as far away as the West Indies. Story panels and artifacts recreate a warehouse alive with business activity among farmers, merchants and shipmasters. Outside the old warehouse there are picnic tables that offer a place to rest and soak up the view, in summer a sea of boats.</p>
        <p>On Main Street, gardening-minded visitors and others simply interested in the beauty of flowers can head to Comstock Ferre &amp; Company, a four-story red barn dating from the 1820's and one of the oldest garden centers in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Today, original tin signs and blazing nursery display of perennials and roses stop traffic. But their indoor row-on-row old rocker bins and tin-lined oak drawers displaying seed stock and bright bouquets of original lithographed packets might be the real scene stealers. When the onion trade (1730-1830) expired, ''Wethersfield farmers were charged with finding a new outlet,'' Ms. Milkofsky said. ''Eight seed companies developed trial and seed gardens in plots that had previously been onion patches.''</p>
        <p>Wethersfield's centerpiece may well be the Webb-Deane-Stevens Museum, a trio of mustard, red and blue houses from the 18th century. Their newest attraction is the Colonial revival-style garden. It was installed behind the Webb House last year from long-lost plans; now old-fashioned flowers, archways and paths lead to a barn, sometimes a setting for weddings. Inside the houses, furniture and decorative arts from 1690 to 1840 reflect the life styles of the merchant Joseph Webb, the diplomat Silas Deane and the leather worker Isaac Stevens. In the Webb house's front parlor it is said that George Washington met with Comte Rochambeau to outline plans that led to the final victory of the Continental Army in Yorktown. The Rev. Wallace Nutting -- renowned as a philosopher, maker of reproduction furniture and Colonial restorationist -- bought the house in 1916.</p>
        <p>The Greek revival circa-1830 Chester Bulkley House, next door to the Wethersfield Museum, is a bed and breakfast and the only overnight lodging in the restored district. A steep flight of steps leads to a sitting room and guest rooms (there are five guest rooms, three with private baths, priced from $65 to $85 plus 12 percent tax). In one room, two white four-poster beds crowned with pineapple finials overlooked a white antiqued bombe chest bearing a bouquet of tulips. White lace swags hang at the windows and floral rugs rest on wide planked floors.</p>
        <p>Just down the block is the circa-1787 Standish House. The gracious white Colonial -- which has served as inn, stagecoach stop, post office and restaurant -- offers dining downstairs and up.</p>
        <p>The brick Georgian Hurlbut-Dunham House, on the other side of the Wethersfield Museum, is typical of many New England houses. It was updated in the 1860's with porches, a colonnade and a commanding belvedere. Much of the last owner's furnishings and collections remain, and a center-hall bombe breakfront is aflow with blue and white china.</p>
        <p>A tour of the Ancient Burying Ground can be a treat if one is fortunate enough to be led by the Historical Society's education coordinator, Betty Arnold, a feisty, knowledgeable 85-year-old woman who has lived in the community since she was in the third grade. Ms. Arnold can prod even weary visitors up the hill among gravestones that tell stories going back to the 1630's. The stones range from simple slabs with crude letters to ornate tables and tombs boasting carved heads and cherub faces. A slave dying a freed man, a fever sweeping the town and sailors perishing at sea are among the historic glimmers.</p>
        <p>And Ms. Arnold can offer fairly direct commentary as well: ''The Puritans were people of the upper sort who believed in a hierarchy,'' she said, pointing out the more prestigious hilltop, where, she added,  ''People were buried on the hill according to their place in society.''</p>
        <p>Across the street is the meeting house of the First Church of Christ (1761). A glass corridor overlooking the Ancient Burying Ground is enthralling, and inside the sanctuary are red velvet pews, mustard, red and green candelabras and a dramatic raised pulpit and canopy. Two blocks south is Temple Beth Torah, housed in a former Methodist church dating to 1689, its double blue doors adorned with raised gold stars.</p>
        <p>''We like to say Wethersfield is 10 minutes and 200 years removed from Hartford,'' said Ms. Milkofsky of the Historical Society. ''It's very much removed from the hustle and bustle.''</p>
