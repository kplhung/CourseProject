        <p>One is a single mother who was thrown out of high school in the 1980's and nearly killed herself, only to be reborn in college as a short-story writer.</p>
        <p>Another first walked into a schoolhouse just after World War I and earned her Ph.D. eight decades later, at 90, nearly blind.</p>
        <p>A third is graduating from college at 18 with a double major in music and mathematics, as well as a Rhodes scholarship.</p>
        <p>A fourth grew up playing war games in Soviet-era Czechoslovakia and became one of the first female cadets to graduate from The Citadel military college.</p>
        <p>They have never met and have little in common. But they are among the more than two million people who have earned associate's, bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees this spring and whose names are being read aloud at commencement exercises on sunny lawns across the country.</p>
        <p>Passing tests, writing papers and going to classes can be arduous under the best conditions, but these four graduates had to scale personal walls that were higher than those climbed by most.</p>
