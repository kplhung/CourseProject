        <p>AMERICAN DAUGHTER</p>
        <p>Discovering My Mother.</p>
        <p>By Elizabeth Kendall.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 225 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Random House. $23.95.</p>
        <p>ON the morning of April 3, 1969, when she was 22, Elizabeth Kendall set out for a vacation on the Gulf Coast with her mother, three brothers and a sister. The six of them drove, while her father, who remained in St. Louis to attend a business lunch, planned to join them that evening by plane. Like most families, the Kendalls had endured seasons of disappointment, disaffection, even tragedy, but that spring their mood was celebratory. Rather than dampening spirits, an unrelenting rain encouraged them to drive faster toward the sun, and when their heavily packed Volkswagen went off the slick road in the wake of a passing truck, Elizabeth, who was spelling her mother at the wheel, had just nudged the speedometer from 60 to 65. A creek ran at a right angle to the highway, and a bridge traversed the creek, and the Kendalls' car hit the bridge wall, and Betty Conant Kendall, asleep in the passenger seat, was killed.</p>
        <p>This accident -- the loss of her mother, and thus the drastic revision of family and of life as she understood it -- provides the lens through which, in ''American Daughter,'' Kendall examines her youth among the sprawling Kendalls and Conants of postwar St. Louis, and, most important, the relationship she had with her mother, a woman whose considerable gifts were spent not so much on a career as on the demands of her husband and six children. ''I know now,'' Kendall writes in her introduction, ''that such an event comes without warning. It is not caused by anything except the rain, the truck's splash, the jam of brakes, the panic of the blinded driver -- me -- on the flooded road. It isn't the result of emotions that have been building in a family, or in a person.'' Of course not. And yet this resigned and calm epitaph, its cool cerebral poise, is belied by the chapters that follow.</p>
        <p>It would have to be, because what we understand intellectually does not inspire narrative. Stories flow from loss and longing, from the mire and muck of emotion and from whatever organ it is that prefers the idea of destiny (i.e., destination, that thing we were driving toward all along) to that of fate (which drops ex machina from a cloudless sky). For most of us it's easier to rewrite family history -- to revise and foreshadow so that we might accommodate an otherwise meaningless blow -- than to sustain the reasonable if excruciating conclusion that experience is random, there is no justice, poetic or otherwise. For Elizabeth Kendall, almost as soon as the family car spun out of control, the accident that took her mother's life began to accrue metaphoric power, enough, 30 years later, to provide the organizing principle to the story of a family that, Kendall would have us witness, seems from the outset to have been founded on poor visibility and bad traction.</p>
        <p>Betty Conant, a sophomore at Vassar in 1945, rebounds from the death of her beloved older brother Jud by marrying another soldier, returned intact from the very place Jud died, Okinawa. Is it this lunge for redemption that precipitates all the other failed attempts at happiness? Perhaps overly influenced by her brother's wartime letters praising ''old-fashion girls . . . over hypothetical masterminds,'' Betty leaves Vassar and sacrifices her college degree to produce first Elizabeth and then a new little Judd, followed, eventually, by four more children. Elizabeth Kendall reports each addition to the family as one blow after another to what she assumes were her mother's once soaring hopes of what life might offer her. But it was Betty Kendall who wanted so many children, who, her daughter acknowledges, ''plowed forward in the fertility enterprise, to which my father contributed his sperm, his salary. . . . In hindsight it seems he had little to do with how the family was shaping up.'' Furthermore, procreation was part of what the author identifies as the era's ''zeitgeist,'' Betty Kendall's response to the end of the war the same as that of many other sisters and wives who got the baby boom off to its explosive start.</p>
        <p>As the mother of six, Betty Kendall spent much -- most -- of her adulthood caring for Elizabeth and her brothers and sisters and balancing their multiplying needs against the demands of a husband who could be both insecure and bullying. She returned to Vassar in 1952 for a summer program at the Institute of Family and Community Living, a kind of highbrow home ec and child development workshop that Elizabeth Kendall, a dance historian and critic, dismisses as ''a smoke-and-mirrors trick, changing her humble role in life to a grand one.'' And yet, isn't it possible to see Betty Kendall's role as genuinely grand? Certainly she took marriage and motherhood seriously, applying what she learned at Vassar to her life at home and giving every evidence that she experienced family as more vocation than blight. The discovery, years later, that her youngest daughter was mentally retarded galvanized Betty Kendall's intelligence and energy and spurred her forward into social service and a consciousness of injustice that eventually grew to embrace the civil rights movement. ''To a religious temperament like my mother's, Faith's condition had clear symbolic implications,'' Elizabeth Kendall writes, identifying one after another instance of her mother's unflagging belief in God and in his signs, in a providence that she herself can't imagine.</p>
        <p>As a bereft daughter, Kendall infuses her past with the grief of abandonment. The childhood events she recounts -- accompanying her parents to church, visiting her grandparents, receiving the gift of a pony from her often irascible father -- are not in themselves so much sad as they are imbued with melancholy, anxiety and loneliness, like old black-and-white photographs tinted with the hue of subsequent emotion. This overlay is most evident in Kendall's use of the diminutive: ''the numbness in the recesses of my well-groomed little self,'' ''at the tender age of 4,'' +a lackluster little figure.'' Numb, tender, lackluster. These are properties of a young woman who stumbles from a wreck that changes her life and her outlook. Are they as truly the characteristics of a girl who hasn't yet lost her mother?</p>
        <p>Perhaps the distinction wouldn't matter if ''American Daughter'' were more memoir than biography, more about Elizabeth and less about Betty Kendall. As it is, the book is an uneasy amalgam. Who is the American daughter of the title? The words are meant to apply to both women, but there are dangers in double biographies, the most obvious being that one vision must accommodate two lives, a balancing act nearly impossible to sustain when one of the subjects also happens to be the author. Betty Kendall ''kept on believing, daughterlike, in a parental and national ideal. And I, the daughter of that daughter, caught with her in the too-tight space of her visions and her beliefs, kept scuffling to get free of that daughterhood: to become cynical and scornful and disbelieving and unreverential. But I couldn't do it while she was alive.'' And after her death?</p>
        <p>''American Daughter'' both owes much and loses much to the accident that inspired it. Otherwise unremarkable passages in Kendall family history acquire gravity from the always looming death of its matriarch, and yet the author's inability to ''let her be meaninglessly gone'' seems to have forced Elizabeth Kendall to conclude that her mother's life had been sacrificed to family long before it was lost by the side of a road. Or is the accident one of projection? ''It was the flood of babies that turned me into a lost soul'' (emphasis mine). When Kendall recounts her early years, she consistently reveals herself to be the eldest child who never recovers from the compounded insult of having to share her mother with one and then another sibling.</p>
        <p>Not just writers but all of us constantly revise our histories and ourselves, and for reasons far less dire than a fatal crash. The revision of another's life is tricky, however, and not necessarily trustworthy. Betty Kendall died, but she didn't lose herself as her daughter lost her, either to a car accident or to her children. On the contrary, she seems to have found herself through answering their needs -- even the tragic and relentless needs of a mentally retarded child -- never suffering the disillusionment with family that characterizes her daughter, a single woman and a career woman, a woman who purposefully and resolutely ''made a life that is in every way the opposite of hers.''</p>
