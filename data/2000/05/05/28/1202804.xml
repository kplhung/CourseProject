        <p>Until a few weeks ago, I expected to live out my life without adopting a firm theory of monopoly.

        <p>Until a few weeks ago, I expected to live out my life without adopting a firm theory of monopoly. The subject, confounded by the obfuscation of economists and lawyers, always struck me as impossibly difficult. Fair competition in capitalism seemed to be like the strike zone in baseball -- a matter of considerable discretion and best left to the regulation of umpires.</p>
        <p>I even thought that some monopolies were useful; securely profitable newspapers obviously behaved more responsibly than economic weaklings. And big was not automatically bad: corporate giants needed giant rivals to feel challenged and checked. I pronounced flexibility a virtue and relied on government umpires to protect our markets and the public interest.</p>
        <p>No longer.</p>
        <p>When the Time Warner cable monopoly in Manhattan chose on May Day to deny me Peter Jennings, Regis Philbin and Ted Koppel merely to squeeze some more millions out of the Disney Company, I realized that the umpire had been much too lax, refusing even to demand payment for use of the broadcast spectrum or to get some free television time for decent election coverage. All this was proof that the media monsters will never put a public interest ahead of their own. Time Warner had for too long controlled not only the cables into my home but also many of the channels and programs passing through its wire. It was hogging both my medium and my message, and the combination virtually guaranteed anticompetitive behavior.</p>
        <p>Now Time Warner wants to merge with AOL and control my cable access to the Internet as well. And still the umpire seems distracted or asleep.</p>
        <p>Not that the May Day blackout was entirely Time Warner's fault. It pulled the trigger but not without provocation from the Mickey Mouse moguls. Because Disney, too, had been allowed to grow too fat and to swallow up media properties like ABC and ESPN, it felt directly threatened by the AOL Time Warner combine. Disney had also threatened me with a blackout, showing equal disregard for my prepaid viewing rights.</p>
        <p>To be sure, the ambitions of Disney and Time Warner are so complementary that they are bound to find an eventual accommodation. But their peace, like their war, will be at my expense. If not soon reduced in size, all the overgrown media monsters will follow in the path of Microsoft, abusing their control over both the conduits and contents of communication to destroy competitors and elude regulation.</p>
        <p>The media news in recent weeks confirms the trend. Viacom swallowed CBS to gain control of 41 percent of the broadcast market (and began maneuvers to overcome the frail regulatory limit of 35 percent). AT&amp;T moved to complete its acquisition of MediaOne so as to seize command of more than one-third of the nation's cable industry. And the five major American music companies virtually confessed to having colluded to cheat their disc customers of more than $500 million with various price-fixing schemes.</p>
        <p>Some newspapers were also caught up in these antics, an uncomfortable reminder that the monopolistic arts antedate the Web. The Hearst Corporation was shown at trial to be finagling to kill its own San Francisco Examiner so that it could acquire the paper's more profitable partner, The Chronicle, and dispense with even nominal competition. Testimony revealed the use of crude promises of editorial support for Mayor Willy Brown if he would drop his opposition and help to gain federal approval for the scheme. (The Examiner and The Chronicle had already been merged for all functions except news gathering under an antitrust exemption that the newspaper industry pushed through Congress 30 years ago. These ''joint operating'' deals have done much less for journalistic enterprise than for profits. But in any case they only disguise and delay the drift toward print monopolies. Even before the Hearst trial ended, a famous rivalry between The Post and The Rocky Mountain News in Denver ended in yet another such ''joining.'')</p>
        <p>So I have learned three things about the evolving media business:</p>
        <p>1. The commendable but all-consuming prosecution of Microsoft by the Justice Department seems to have exhausted or distracted the umpire and left the rest of the field unguarded.</p>
        <p>2. The Clinton administration's repeated claim that the lure of monopolistic profits can stimulate giant corporations to innovate is unproved and probably wrong. As William Safire observed with an African proverb after the May Day blackout, ''When elephants fight, it is the grass that suffers.''</p>
        <p>3. The hope that the new technologies will democratize the commerce of communication is, on present evidence, nave. The world's half-dozen conglomerated merchants of information and entertainment control so many conduits and so much content that they will inevitably rig the market to favor their own transmissions and services and to disadvantage all others.</p>
        <p>In some distant future, it may become possible for Americans to get their Web-based news, fun and education by many competing routes, including interactive cables, telephone wires, wireless radio and satellite dishes. But for the foreseeable future, the path of choice will be the cables that already carry TV images into three of every four homes.</p>
        <p>It is the lure of owning cables that inspired AOL to offer billions to acquire Time Warner and AT&amp;T to mortgage itself to buy MediaOne. They well understand, even if the umpires don't, that the complex ''architecture'' by which small packets of data travel to and from the Web now permits the owners of cable lines to enhance the speed and quality of their own messages and to shortchange rivals.</p>
        <p>Just months ago, when America Online had reason to fear that AT&amp;T's new cable prowess would be used against it, AOL begged the courts and Congress to intervene to forbid all discrimination. Yet now that it hopes to own Time Warner's cables, AOL no longer begs; it actively opposes government regulation. To facilitate Washington's approval of their marriage, AOL and Time Warner promise fair access for ''multiple'' -- if not all -- Web services. As an alert White House should know, this all depends on what ''all'' means.</p>
        <p>It was fear of cable discrimination that drove Disney toward the May Day shootout. Similar disruptions are inevitable if the media's quasi-monopolies go unchecked.</p>
        <p>By far the best way to achieve openness would be to require media corporations to choose between the business of conduit and the business of content, between managing the lines of communication and designing the messages and services to be transmitted. Hoarding both functions confers monopolistic power to rig the market and to diminish competition. The emerging concentrations of power risk a May Day every day.</p>
