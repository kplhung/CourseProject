      <block class="full_text">
        <p>With each jab step, each shot from beyond the arc, Reggie Miller's future grows more secure, just as the future of his Indiana Pacers teammates grows more secure.</p>
        <p>The Pacers, who appeared to need a roster overhaul after the younger, athletic Knicks jumped over them in last season's Eastern Conference finals, have aged more gracefully than Dick Clark; more gracefully than even Donnie Walsh could have imagined.</p>
        <p>''I'm kind of laughing about it,'' said Walsh, the Pacers' team president, ''because everybody has been telling me for three or four years, you know, 'You guys are going to have to break up the team.' I never really felt that way. That's why I'm really proud of how they played, because I wasn't as sure this year as I was in years past.''</p>
        <p>The playoff performances of Miller, Mark Jackson, Jalen Rose and Austin Croshere have all but ensured Indiana's makeup for the next few seasons. Walsh held off signing Miller and Jackson to extensions, a development that caused a rift between the team and its veterans.</p>
        <p>Only a month ago, Jackson's return was thought to be a huge question mark. But as the Pacers try to advance to the finals for the first time in the team's N.B.A. history, the improvisational point guard seems a good bet to return as well.</p>
        <p>''I always wanted to re-sign Reggie,'' Walsh said. ''I just didn't want to do an extension before I saw what the team was because we had too many free agents. I've already made up my mind on that. I would bring them all back.''</p>
        <p>With six of his top eight players eligible for free agency, the notion of detonating the roster in the off-season was a possibility. ''I didn't want to sign up a bunch of guys and then the team goes down and you're stuck,'' Walsh said last month.</p>
        <p>But with Miller putting up impressive numbers in the playoffs -- he shot down Milwaukee in Game 5 of the first round, erupting for 41 points, and hit almost every important shot he needed to against Philadelphia in the second round -- the likelihood of the All-Star swingman's finishing his career with the Pacers is almost guaranteed.</p>
        <p>One overlooked fact in Indiana's run toward the finals was that the Pacers were not only chasing an elusive championship, but many of them were also playing for contracts. In the cases of Miller and Jackson, they were playing for perhaps the last big money deal they will sign in their careers.</p>
        <p>As the Knicks can attest to when Patrick Ewing put up monster numbers during his free-agent-to-be season in 1996-97, financial incentive can often make old legs look young again.</p>
        <p>Asked if Miller, who is in the last year of a four-year, $36 million contract, had warranted the most lucrative deal possible after this season under collective bargaining agreement rules, Walsh said: ''You'd have to give it to him, because he's been successful. I've always tried to pay guys their value, no matter what their leverage is. So I don't go by where else he could go and all that. When we sit down, my intention is to re-sign him.''</p>
        <p>Miller most likely won't sign for the absolute maximum, but he'll get a deal close to it.</p>
        <p>''Reggie has earned the right to finish his career in Indiana,'' said Arn Tellem, the agent for both Miller and Jackson. ''We have every intention of working out a deal. They've shown, as a team, they can play together and compete for a title for a few more years.''</p>
        <p>Walsh has one other major detail: finding Larry Bird's replacement. Bird has said he would retire after three seasons as coach, with the possibility that he might remain in the front office. The more likely scenario has Bird serving as a consultant from his Florida home.</p>
        <p>''My feeling is he won't stick around after it's over,'' Walsh said. ''I hate losing Larry. It's been as good a time as I've had. This has been special. After he leaves, people will step back and go, 'You know, we were all writing that this guy could never be a head coach.' ''</p>
        <p>The Jordan Factor</p>
        <p>Michael Jordan attacked the game with ferocity when he played, outmaneuvering opponents before he conquered them. He was so competitive and driven, he wanted to bury you, whether the game was basketball, golf or cards on the team charter.</p>
        <p>But in the world of contract negotiations, if the other side thinks it lost and it thinks you have won handily, you have made a bad deal.</p>
        <p>As he continues his coaching search for the Washington Wizards, the franchise's head of basketball operations has talked with Lenny Wilkens, St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis and John Paxson, Jordan's former teammate.</p>
        <p>While the meetings begin in an amicable and cordial manner, they often evolve into: This is how Michael does things, according to at least two people with knowledge of his coaching search. It is not that he bullies his prospective employees but that he almost insultingly lowballs them, offering a pittance for arguably one of the toughest, no-win jobs in the National Basketball Association, according to the two people. Jordan was unavailable for comment. Jarvis's contract demands exceeded what Jordan was willing to pay. Somehow, agents have put into their clients' heads that they need to be making at least what John Calipari made -- $3 million a season -- to jump to a pro job.</p>
        <p>Perhaps Jordan should not be blamed for his intransigence, the idea that his candidates should be so giddy and thankful to be working under the greatest player in history. After all, he is constantly reminded of his exalted status by those close to him.</p>
        <p>Jordan was in Chicago federal court last Tuesday over a disagreement with his partners in a bankrupt restaurant. He is asking that he be allowed to put his name on a future Chicago restaurant.</p>
        <p>His partners, Gene and Joseph Silverberg, a pair of Chicago clothiers who developed Michael Jordan's Restaurant, say their contract gives them control of the name in Chicago. The trial was muddled with monotonous legalese. But how about that star witness, David Falk?</p>
        <p>''In marketing, Michael Jordan's name is like magic in a bottle,'' Falk, the leadoff witness, told the court. He also testified, ''Michael Jordan is the most popular human being on the planet,'' conveniently leaving out Pope John Paul II and Muhammad Ali, among others.</p>
        <p>According to The Associated Press, Falk also testified that the Silverbergs made statements to the news media that denigrated Jordan once the legal battle got under way, and thus failed to adhere to provisions of the contract requiring them to protect the superstar's ''clean-cut, Americana image.''</p>
        <p>Jordan visited companies such as Coca-Cola and McDonald's when he emerged as a marketing giant, Falk said. Falk said that ''in keeping with John Kennedy's inaugural, we told them, 'Ask not what Michael Jordan can do for you but ask what you can do for Michael Jordan.' ''</p>
        <p>You know what? Whoever takes the Washington job should kiss Michael's Gucci loafers and work free. Shame on anyone who would dare ask for more.</p>
        <p>Time to Open the Books</p>
        <p>First, it was the San Antonio Spurs shamelessly using Tim Duncan, David Robinson and a recovering Sean Elliott to campaign for a new arena last fall, essentially asking taxpayers to forgo education and other civic needs to help an owner who could not afford a new luxury-boxed  technodrome by himself.</p>
        <p>Now Ray Wooldridge, the Charlotte co-owner, said the Hornets would continue losing $1 million a month until the Charlotte Coliseum was replaced. He proposed the Hornets pay 25 percent of the cost of a $250 million uptown arena, with the rest coming from public sources.</p>
        <p>To the city's credit, Wooldridge has been asked by city council members to prove that his team is losing nearly $1 million a month by opening the team's accounting books.</p>
        <p>''I would assume they are losing money, but if we are coming down to a significant amount of public money, then I think we need to see their books,'' said Joe White, a council member who advocates a referendum on arena funding.</p>
        <p>Malcolm Graham, another council member, said: ''One of the things they definitely don't have is public confidence. They have to win the public-relations war, and right now they're losing badly.''</p>
        <p>The Hornets have lost money the past two seasons. Fewer than 12,000 fans attended a playoff game against the Philadelphia 76ers last month, barely more than half of the building's capacity.</p>
        <p>But with new owners with deep pockets buying into the league -- like the billionaire Mark Cuban, who purchased the Dallas Mavericks -- isn't it time the league took a harder look at luring more financially solvent businessmen into the fold, instead of people who ask their ticket-gouged fans to subsidize new buildings?</p>
