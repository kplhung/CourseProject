        <p>THE large, flappy ears fooled everybody. Viewed from afar on a bicycle or up close from behind, everything about the man suggested Massimo Troisi in the role of Mario, the humble letter carrier, budding poet and ill-fated political banner-bearer in the Italian film ''Il Postino'' (''The Postman''). The ears perfectly resembled Troisi's and so did the hair and the back of the head, the tall, spare build and gangling movements. In reality, as the director Michael Radford explains on a new DVD from Miramax, Mario was often a stand-in.</p>
        <p>Movie doubles are common, of course, but in a film as intimate and finely nuanced as this one, substitution was risky. In fact, there was no choice. Troisi was mortally ill with heart disease and so weak that often he could remain on his feet for only 30 seconds at a time. ''Il Postino'' (1995) being one of the most popular foreign-language films ever released in the United States, Troisi's personal saga is well known, but the Radford account nicely details a scene-juggling rush for the finish by a cast in sync with the situation.</p>
        <p>During filming, Troisi, who was 41, learned that he needed a heart transplant. But ''Il Postino'' was a personal quest. Several years earlier he had interested Mr. Radford in making a film based on the novel ''Burning Patience'' by Antonio Skarmeta, about a postman discovering the poetry of Pablo Neruda, the Chilean writer, diplomat and Communist politician. There would be no stopping now, and after a week off, Troisi pressed on. Scenes were scheduled to make it as easy as possible. ''He had to sit between takes,'' Mr. Radford says on the disc.</p>
        <p>On the day he died in June 1994, Troisi was filmed standing on a box reciting the poetry Mario has written inspired by Neruda, played by Philippe Noiret. The film is set in 1952 and Neruda, expelled from Chile for political reasons, chooses to spend his exile on a small Italian island rising straight and green out of a brilliantly blue sea. Being the only resident to receive much mail, Neruda needs postal delivery and Mario, curious about the great man, accepts the job of pedaling deliveries up into the precipitous countryside to the house Neruda shares with the woman he calls Amor (Anna Bonaiuto).</p>
        <p>For those bike rides, or for any moment when Troisi's wondrously expressive face wasn't required in close-up, the stand-in was employed. ''I had to do this continually just to put Massimo into scenes where he hadn't appeared at all, to give a sense that it was him,'' says Mr. Radford, who identifies the double only as Gerardo. At times Gerardo's face appears, but just far enough away to maintain the illusion. So Troisi-like was Gerardo, Mr. Radford adds, that at Troisi's funeral some Neapolitans thought the stand-in was the actor's ghost walking behind the coffin.</p>
        <p>In the film, Neruda is already jumping at any letters from Sweden (in life he wouldn't win the Nobel Prize until 1971). Fascinated by poetry, the inquisitive Mario fights through his shyness to ask Neruda how to become a poet. ''Here I had a long discussion with Philippe Noirot about how to respond to this,'' Mr. Radford says, ''how to take it with absolute seriousness, knowing that it was the most idiotic question in the world, but at the same time having respect because you know the person is looking for knowledge.''</p>
        <p>Neruda sends him to the beach to look for metaphors, but Mario's blossoming begins when he starts to realize that Neruda's poetry isn't rarefied at all but is written about common people like him. A bond slowly builds between the two, finally leading to the verse Mario composes for the haughty bar girl Beatrice (Maria Grazia Cucinotta). The groundwork for that intricately conceived process begins back in the post office when Mario is interviewed for the letter-carrying position by the telegraph operator, played by Renato Scarpa.</p>
        <p>Scenes were shot in the order that best accommodated Troisi's condition. The post office interview was one of the last filmed. ''It was a great torment to me because I knew if I didn't shoot these scenes we didn't have a movie,'' Mr. Radford says. Troisi looks desperately weak standing in the office with his bicycle. When they started the film, the director let the actor, essentially a comic by profession, feel his way through material without necessarily learning the lines per se. Gradually the comfort level rose between the actors. Like most comics, Troisi performed best on the first take, which suited Mr. Scarpa. ''Their timing was so perfect, they were able to do these scenes in no time at all,'' Mr. Radford says.</p>
        <p>At first Mario wants Neruda to compose a poem for Beatrice, but Neruda refuses, perhaps a little too vehemently. ''If you make this much fuss over one poem, how are you going to win the Nobel Prize?'' Mario asks. Neruda stalks off, but later agrees to go to the bar with Mario in an attempt to warm up the young woman. Ms. Cucinotta had virtually no experience. ''She'd been in a couple of soft-porn movies,'' Mr. Radford says. ''I was very, very worried about her.'' She was chosen for her frosty demeanor. ''One thing I asked her to do was never to smile unless I told her to,'' Mr. Radford explains. ''When she played in that contemptuous manner, she had this fantastic screen presence.''</p>
        <p>Earlier in the film, she brushes off Mario. ''She has to seduce him demurely but with contempt,'' Mr. Radford says, ''showing that at the same time she is seducing him she wants nothing to do with him at all. She has to be closed, so when she gets to the moment she hears the poetry, she will open.''</p>
        <p>One unsung virtue of DVD is that the film can be stopped to freeze a frame with utmost clarity, and stopping the action at random intervals often reveals the masterful Noiret carrying the scene with him.</p>
        <p>AT one point Neruda and Mario sit side by side on a beach on an island that had to be used because Troisi was too weak to reach the island originally chosen. The scene runs well over two minutes and was done in one take. ''This shot says everything about cinema,'' Mr. Radford states on the disc. ''It isn't complicated, but it is difficult to get to that point. We had to shoot it simply because Massimo was so ill.''</p>
        <p>Neruda composes a little verse for Mario right on the spot. It is about the sea. ''My name is the sea, it says, striking a stone but not convincing it.'' When he is done, he asks Mario how he liked it. ''It's weird,'' Mario replies. Neruda calls him a severe critic. Mario answers that he was referring to his feelings, not the poem. ''The words went back and forth like the sea,'' he says. ''Then there's that rhythm. I felt seasick, in fact. I felt like a boat tossing around on those words.''</p>
        <p>''See what you've done,'' Neruda tells him. ''You've invented a metaphor.''</p>
