        <p>''It's like astronaut camp for teachers.''</p>
        <p>In any word association game, that would hardly be the way most residents here would think of their school district.</p>
        <p>Yet that is precisely the opinion one Harvard researcher has of schools run by Marilyn Davenport, who last year became director of elementary education in the South Orange-Maplewood School District and principal of the Seth Boyden Demonstration School.</p>
        <p>Since the book ''Frames of Mind'' was published in 1983, school districts throughout the country have been influenced by the work of Howard Gardner, a Harvard University professor who developed the theory of multiple intelligences -- which simply means different people can be smart in different ways. And recently Ms. Davenport, an educator recognized as having had great success in implementing the theory, came to this district with its history of high achievement and is trying to maintain it.</p>
        <p>''When we work with a child, we must think, 'I don't know how this child is smart, but I'm going to find out,' '' she said.</p>
        <p>In her previous job as principal of the Governor Bent Elementary School in Albuquerque, test scores consistently placed in the top 5 among the district's 80 elementary schools even though similar schools with  many children from lower socio-economic groups might have typically placed in the bottom quartile.</p>
        <p>Ms. Davenport's approach appealed to this district, which has about 6,300 students, and homes that range from modest to mansions. Like her school in Albuquerque, the towns have seen a rise in students from lower socio-economic groups.</p>
        <p>In the first year of testing, in 1999, under the Elementary School Proficiency Assessment, 76 percent of the district's fourth graders scored proficient or above in math, compared with 60 percent average statewide. In language arts, 55 percent were proficient or higher (compared with 42 percent statewide) and in science, 93 percent showed proficiency or above (compared with 86 percent statewide).</p>
        <p>''We have a diverse community makeup and high expectations,'' says Peter Horoschak, the South Orange-Maplewood district superintendent who worked with Ms. Davenport in Albuquerque. ''To me, that meant we had the makings for demonstrating that students from different kinds of backgrounds and ethnicities can really succeed.''</p>
        <p>One main focus for Ms. Davenport in her new job is the Seth Boyden Demonstration School, an elementary school where teachers can best develop educational practices to be used throughout the district.</p>
        <p>The school, which has more than 450 students, this year accepted about 70 transfer students from other district schools as part of a continuing districtwide effort to achieve racial and economic balance. At an open house this month, about 200 people came to learn about the school and its open enrollment plan.</p>
        <p>It is hoped that these efforts will help to reinvigorate schools with the district's lowest test scores, including Seth Boyden.</p>
        <p>''If one or more of our elementary schools are perceived as being laggards, then as a community, we're going to fail,'' said the board of education president, Brian O'Leary, who chose to send his kindergartner to Seth Boyden in Maplewood instead of to the Marshall School in South Orange, his neighborhood school. ''We can't say, well, two-thirds of our schools are really good. All of them have to be uniformly excellent.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Davenport is not alone in her embrace of the theory, but she is considered an exemplar of its practical application. After Dr. Gardner first visited Ms. Davenport's school in Albuquerque in the early 1990's, he told an associate that it reminded him of the finest prep schools.</p>
        <p>In his groundbreaking book, Dr. Gardner questioned the idea of intelligence as a uniform capacity that can be measured in something like an IQ test. Instead, he has identified several kinds of intelligence: linguistic, musical, logical-mathematical, spatial, bodily-kinesthetic, inter- and intrapersonal and naturalist. Everyone shares these intelligences, the idea goes, but people are stronger in some areas than others. Once teachers have identified each child's strengths and weaknesses, they can better understand how the child can achieve.</p>
        <p>''Children come to you thinking they're smart,'' Ms. Davenport said, ''but sometimes in school we convince them they're not. Intelligence is not fixed. If you believe that, you don't think much can be done in school.''</p>
        <p>To achieve excellence, Ms. Davenport ''feels that it's important for children to have a sense of competence and a feeling that they belong,'' noted Mindy Kornhaber, a Harvard researcher who works with Dr. Gardner and has investigated the practical use of multiple intelligence for the last nine years. Ms. Davenport's convictions provided the foundation for implementing the theory successfully, Dr. Kornhaber believes.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes the theory is adopted because it sounds good,'' she said. ''There's not a lot of prior thinking about why it sounds good or what it might do.''</p>
        <p>When Dr. Kornhaber studied Ms. Davenport's school in Albuquerque, she found that ''the work that the children and the teachers were doing was spectacular.''</p>
        <p>''They had no art teacher and yet the classrooms were like children's museums,'' Dr. Kornhaber said. ''The artwork was all project-oriented. If they were doing a project on the lifecycles of animals, they didn't just show you what a horse looked like. They built beautiful three-dimensional models of horses, and wrote an elaborate book about its lifecycle. They were able to do wonderful presentations about their work.''</p>
        <p>Although Dr. Gardner's work hasn't described how to implement the theory, Dr. Kornhaber thinks Ms. Davenport's work in Albuquerque was a good model because teachers called on children to use a variety of different abilities.</p>
        <p>''They weren't just putting pencil to paper to produce a report on a horse. They were using their aesthetic sensibility,'' she said. ''They had to communicate with each other to produce the work. There was even a logical-mathematical piece to it because they had to think about how to use multiple sources of data, how make points and use research.''</p>
        <p>As part of how to practically apply what the children have learned, Ms. Davenport says she has developed a list of intelligent behaviors for students, which range from understanding how they learn, to being joyful in school, to taking the time to celebrate their accomplishments.</p>
        <p>In the South Orange-Maplewood district, Seth Boyden will be used to develop teachers districtwide.</p>
        <p>As Dr. Kornhaber said, ''For anyone who is interested in being at the top of their game, that's the school to be in.''</p>
        <p>Although Ms. Davenport has been in her new district only briefly, Dr. Kornhaber has no doubt she will leave her mark.</p>
        <p>''The school will change in ways that are in line with her thinking, philosophy and experience, because she doesn't let go,'' she said.</p>
        <p>While test scores will most likely not immediately reflect Ms. Davenport's work, the towns seem ready to stay the course.</p>
        <p>''The key thing for a political figures like me is to make sure we hold the district to high standards and not back away from the importance of using public measures like test scores,'' Mr. O'Leary said. ''At the same time, we have to give people time to make the substantial changes required to make sure we get good scores for the right reasons. We're not simply looking for good scores, but for quality education.''</p>
        <p>SCHOOLS  Correction:  June 4, 2000, Sunday  A picture caption last Sunday about the Maplewood-South Orange School District, where ''multiple intelligence'' theories are being applied, misspelled the name of the principal of the Seth Boyden Demonstration School, who is also the district's director of elementary education. She is Marilyn Davenport, not Davernport.</p>
