        <p>The stately colon, the confiding parenthesis and the gently pausing comma demand to know: what's behind today's big dash to the dash? Why has this lingua interruptus -- expressing uncertainty, jerking the reader around, setting up startling conclusions, imitating patterns of speech -- come to dominate our prose?</p>
        <p>In the preceding paragraph, I used a pair of dashes to interrupt a sentence and insert supplementary material that gave the question meaning or -- to writers, at least -- urgency. I could as easily have used a pair of parentheses, specifically designed for the purpose of graceful interjection of useful explication. In the sentence beginning this paragraph, I could again have used parentheses (''parens'' to friends) or even commas to separate the mild interjection of ''to writers, at least,'' but I didn't. Why not? Because I have fallen into the habit of trying too often to make writing read like speaking.</p>

        <p>The stately colon, the confiding parenthesis and the gently pausing comma demand to know: what's behind today's big dash to the dash? Why has this lingua interruptus -- expressing uncertainty, jerking the reader around, setting up startling conclusions, imitating patterns of speech -- come to dominate our prose?</p>
        <p>In the preceding paragraph, I used a pair of dashes to interrupt a sentence and insert supplementary material that gave the question meaning or -- to writers, at least -- urgency. I could as easily have used a pair of parentheses, specifically designed for the purpose of graceful interjection of useful explication. In the sentence beginning this paragraph, I could again have used parentheses (''parens'' to friends) or even commas to separate the mild interjection of ''to writers, at least,'' but I didn't. Why not? Because I have fallen into the habit of trying too often to make writing read like speaking.</p>
        <p>The spoken sentence is filled with uttered second thoughts, changes of direction, lurches off on tangents and similar twists. That's because we say what we think as we think it, and thoughts have a way of tumbling over one another, and we stick them in our flow of words as each notion comes to us. In this age of raw transcription, art strains to imitate life, and artful writers feel the pressure to mirror the speech patterns of yammering people by imitating their higgledy-piggledy outpouring of unedited thoughts.</p>
        <p>That transcribed-speech technique is fine for writers of fiction and is especially apt for playwrights and screenwriters who reveal their characters' characters realistically through their speech. Some characters blurt their thoughts, showing honesty; others weasel their words, showing duplicity; yet others expostulate grammatically but endlessly, showing off. Writers of drama must write speech, not writing, because real people do not speak writing. Hence we have pauses, delays -- you get my drift? -- half-stops, restarts, stammering and exclamatory grunts (ugh!) and drifting off into pre-dot-com ellipses. . . . To put this speech in written form -- that is, to transcribe it -- we have seen the powerful punch -- pow! right in the kisser -- of illustrative punctuation.</p>
        <p>Good dramatic writers are in favor of whatever turns the reader on. In an 1863 poem, the poet Emily Dickinson, writing in the halting voice of a woman dying, used the dash to signify gasping for breath: ''I am alive -- I guess -/The Branches on my Hand/Are full of Morning Glory -- And at my finger's end -/The Carmine -- tingles warm -/And if I hold a Glass/Across my Mouth -- it blurs it -/</p>
        <p>Physician's -- proof of Breath -/I am alive.''</p>
        <p>In our time, the writing of Tom Wolfe has made stylish use of the dash; he combines it with italics and the midsentence exclamation point to indicate herky-jerkiness or panic in thinking. In an article in the current Harper's deriding the critics of American ''triumphalism,'' the iconoclastic Wolfe steps into their shoes to write, ''After the Soviet archives were opened up -- I mean, damn! -- it looks like Hiss and the Rosenbergs actually were Soviet agents -- and even the Witch Hunt, which was one of the bedrocks of our beliefs -- damn again! -.'' That's the use of fictional internal monologue in a nonfiction article, and the dash does its job of chopping up the speech.</p>
        <p>But writers of narrative and exposition, as well as those who present fiction in the third person, choose to use the language in the voice of the writer and not of a character. The written sentence, which is not to be confused with the spoken sentence that has been transcribed, gives its creator a chance to rethink the ideas that have come off the top of the head, to reassemble them in an orderly series, to snip off the stupidities and shoot the strays, thereby to marshal a cogent argument or paint a striking image.</p>
        <p>On Punctuation Highway, the writer-as-speaker is a dasher, only half-braking at every stop sign; the writer-as-writer measures every pause, uses a comma for the speed bump and a semicolon to proceed with caution at the balancing of closely related complete thoughts, as in this sentence. The colon, a strict setter-up of things to follow, is like an arrow that says ''Now watch this'' to the reader, but it is too often replaced by the do-anything dash.</p>
        <p>Prof. Richard Veit of the University of North Carolina at Wilmington disagrees with me about the danger of the em, which is the typographer's term for the length of the dash: it's as long as the letter M in the same font. ''Technically, no function of the em couldn't be handled by other punctuation -- comma, colon, semicolon, period or parentheses,'' he notes. ''The impact of the em is not syntactic but visual. Its shape and length demand a pause and impart drama. It sets up a punch line in a way a colon cannot. Arthur Wallace Calhoun put a code of the Old South into words in 1918: 'A woman's name should appear in print but twice -- when she marries and when she dies.''' That was then; now, just as women appear in print a lot, the dash appears too often. I acknowledge that dashes can be useful -- say, to add an example -- and are surely more emphatic than parentheses (without the sly sharing of confidence with the reader). And the dash is indispensible for surrounding a list that already contains commas -- weakly beginning a sentence with a conjunction, misspelling indispensable, and incorrectly using a comma before the and preceding the final item in a series -- but undiluted dashiness has become the mark of the slapdash writer who fails to take the trouble to differentiate among the pauses of punctuation.</p>
        <p>Writing is different from speaking. Organize your written thoughts so that you don't have to stud your sentences with asides, sudden additions, curses or last-minute entries. Limit your use of the dash to its indisp -- to those functions where it beats the other punctuation pauses -- or else.</p>
