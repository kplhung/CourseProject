        <p>In recent months, even a statistician could be forgiven for feeling as if the bad old New York crime days weren't so far away after all: Seven Wendy's employees herded into a walk-in refrigerator in Queens and gunned down mercilessly, shot in the head.

        <p>In recent months, even a statistician could be forgiven for feeling as if the bad old New York crime days weren't so far away after all: Seven Wendy's employees herded into a walk-in refrigerator in Queens and gunned down mercilessly, shot in the head. Nine livery-cab drivers killed in four months. Mother robbed in a subway by a gunman holding a pistol to a toddler's head. Woman pushed into an oncoming train. Woman attacked with a brick on Midtown street.</p>
        <p>In the late 1980's and early 1990's, it was exactly these kinds of ghoulishly violent crimes that made the city seem like a dark, cartoonish Gotham -- a town of mayhem completely beyond the control of the police. The hallmarks of those days have not faded from memory -- the random attacks, the bystanders caught in crossfire, the gunmen taking money from victims and killing them anyway, gratuitously, almost for sport.</p>
        <p>So one might expect that the recent crime headlines -- especially when combined with a surge in the murder rate, the first jump in a major crime category in eight years -- would be dredging up some old feelings. Feelings, maybe, that the reliable downward march of crime, like the reliable upward march of the stock market, cannot last forever.</p>
        <p>Feelings like the ones voiced by Mohammed T. Abboud, a clerk at a Harlem bodega, who remembers the jittery days of high crime when he kept a sharp ice pick in the change drawer of his cash register. ''There is nothing inside but money now,'' he said the other day, popping the register open and displaying a tray of bills. ''But you never know. There may come a time to put it back.''</p>
        <p>Still, in dozens of interviews across the city in the last two weeks, it turned out to be difficult to catch many people -- especially affluent people -- in the act of worrying about the return of crime to where they live and work. As New Yorkers do, most start out conversations by saying reflexively that, of course, ''you have to keep your antennas up,'' as one Bronx resident put it. But after a few minutes, it becomes apparent that they are much more preoccupied with a long list of more prosaic issues that seem to affect their lives more directly than gnawing fears of crime: their children's education, their sky-high rents, street-side parking, even getting a seat on the subway.</p>
        <p>Which raises some questions: Why does it seem that high-profile crimes do not resonate in the city the way they used to? Wasn't there a time when five people brutally slain in a fast-food restaurant would cause people to think twice before venturing from home? A time when nine similar killings, five of them in one month, would have been seen as something of a crime wave?</p>
        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and police officials certainly worry about New Yorkers seeing it that way. When several hundred officers were assigned last month solely to protect independent taxi drivers, one city official said that the police were under intense pressure from City Hall to safeguard the perception, not just the reality, that crime is down.</p>
        <p>But if the views of Sandra Frierson, 55, a painter and sculptor, reflect the mood of New York, City Hall does not have much to worry about.</p>
        <p>Ms. Frierson was born in Flatbush, Brooklyn, now lives in Park Slope, Brooklyn, and has rented apartments in every borough in the city except for Staten Island. She clearly remembers the dark days when she was so unnerved by the city's sense of imminent danger that she often had her husband walk her to the store just to buy a tube of toothpaste. Although she said that the killings in Queens last week were ''despicable'' and proved ''how sick we've all become,'' she went on to make this admission: ''As bad as I feel for the people who were killed, I never think something like that could happen to me these days. It's like it's outside the realm of my world.''</p>
        <p>She continued: ''Things in the city have definitely changed. I mean, I feel safer now, not just in my own neighborhood but almost everywhere I go. I still keep my eyes open, of course, you'd be a fool not to. But there's just not that sense anymore that things are totally crazy, out of control.''</p>
        <p>Thomas Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission, a police watchdog group, said he thought  those kinds of feelings were still widespread, and it would take more than a series of murders or small increases in crime to shake them.</p>
        <p>''There's a difference between fear and concern,'' Mr. Reppetto said. ''I think New Yorkers have certainly become more concerned about crime over the last few weeks as these high-profile crimes have been happening. I don't think that they are necessarily more fearful about crime because it hasn't touched them like it once did, unless you're a livery-cab driver or part of another group that's been affected.''</p>
        <p>It seems perfectly natural for people who live or work in areas where criminals have struck to feel unstable, unsteady, as if next time it could be them. It makes sense that people like Xavier Veliz, the manager of a McDonald's in Flushing on the same block where Wednesday's shootings occurred, should say: ''I don't know if I'm upset, afraid, nervous or whatever. It happened to them, but it could have easily happened to us.''</p>
        <p>What seems striking, however, is that this localized sense of fear has apparently not percolated through the city at large as it has in the past. At least according to those interviewed for this article, the recent rash of violent crimes in New York has created pockets of fear, not broad swaths of it. The difference, experts say, is simply a matter of context. Crime remains at 30-year lows in New York, and despite the rise in homicides, violent crime overall was down 7.5 percent during the first three months of this year, compared with the same period in 1999.</p>
        <p>But it is not just that the volume of crime is much lower, they say. It is also that the kinds of violent crime that were peaking a decade ago, mostly associated with the virulent crack trade, seemed more random and thus more threatening over all than high-profile violent crimes now. Both periods were marked by high numbers of livery-cab shootings, for example, but it was other kinds of shootings back then -- drive-bys, gunfights on street corners and in playgrounds -- that created the real fear and amplified the effects of livery shootings.</p>
        <p>''There was more randomness,'' said Jeffrey Fagan, director of the Center for Violence Research and Prevention at Columbia University. ''Two kids bump into each other in the subway station or the street and just shoot each other, and that's a crime that could affect anyone. Or at least there was a subjectively plausible possibility that it might affect any citizen.''</p>
        <p>By contrast, while there were about 13 percent more killings in the city from January through March, compared with the same period in 1999, the police say that most of those homicides occurred indoors and involved people who knew one another.</p>
        <p>It seems in some ways as if the scary randomness of crime has moved elsewhere in the country, particularly given the freakish tragedies of bloody school shootings and spontaneous office murders that have occurred in places like Colorado, Arkansas and Georgia. Although New York may once have felt like a macabre funhouse where anything could -- and did -- happen, compared with  recent events in the heartland, the city has suddenly begun to seem like a relatively safe haven. ''I'd be more frightened going to school in some little town in Mississippi where you've got crazy kids with their parents' shotguns than walking through the Bronx with a stash of $100 bills in my pocket,'' said David Grable, a 31-year-old electrical engineer who was strolling on a quiet avenue on the Upper West Side last week. ''People used to think we were living through hell in New York. Now, it's everywhere else that's crazy.''</p>
        <p>Another theory, perhaps complementary, is that the lack of widespread anxiety about recent crimes is a kind of flip side of the ''broken windows'' theory popularized by James Q. Wilson, a professor emeritus at the University of California in Los Angeles, and George Kelling, a  Rutgers University professor, in a 1982 article in The Atlantic Monthly.</p>
        <p>The theory, a big influence on the style of policing that evolved under Mr. Giuliani, holds in part that crime and low-level civic disorder are very closely linked. A fear of crime can sometimes actually just be anxiety caused by a ''sense that the street is disorderly, a source of distasteful, worrisome encounters,'' as the article stated it.</p>
        <p>So perhaps now, with the police still vigorously pursuing quality-of-life crimes and low-level criminals, a perception of greater orderliness has contributed to a more unassailable feeling of general security and manageability, a feeling that could withstand even a sizable jump in the crime rate before it eroded.</p>
        <p>Of course, in some neighborhoods, the crime rate -- or, at least the fear of crime -- never really eroded at all. The poor have always borne the brunt of crime, and there is a huge population in the city who say that their uneasiness has never left them.</p>
        <p>Like Moses Garcia, 18, a senior at the New School for Arts and Sciences in the Soundview section of the Bronx, the neighborhood where Amadou Diallo was shot by four police officers in 1999.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, Mr. Garcia reached down to tie his boots in the back seat of a livery cab and the driver, trembling, ordered him out because she thought he was reaching for a gun. It could be interpreted as a telling moment, but Mr. Garcia pointed out that it is nothing new: for as long as he can remember, livery-cab drivers in his neighborhood have been terrified of young men.  ''There's a lot of violence that happens around here that don't ever get covered by the news,'' he said. ''This isn't much different.''</p>
        <p>Curtis Lawrence spoke of a similar feeling while washing his 10-year-old Buick sedan with a bucket of soapy water and a rag on the streets of East New York, Brooklyn, a few nights ago. Mr. Lawrence, 47, is a hefty man who worked as a cable television installer until 10 months ago when he lost his left eye in a scuffle with ''a couple of street punks,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Although he acknowledged that crime had dropped steeply in his neighborhood in the last several years, he insisted that there were still problems. This month alone, for example, a pair of armed youths shot two employees of a bodega on Blake Avenue, killing one, and six members of a street gang known as the Crime Family were arrested on charges of forcing a tenant of a Blake Avenue housing project from his home and then converting the apartment into a drug den.</p>
        <p>''So whatever the cops say, the people see more, know more and know better,'' Mr. Lawrence explained, sounding more sorrowful than angry. ''You can flash around whatever numbers you want, but ask anyone who lives around here and they'll say the same damn thing: if you smart, you watch your back.''</p>
        <p>So what about the recent crimes in the headlines then? Did they augur a return to the chaos of the past?</p>
        <p>''Return to what?'' Mr. Lawrence asked. ''We ain't never left nothing behind to return to.''</p>
