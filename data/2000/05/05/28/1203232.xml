        <p>I must confess, yes, I really must. My conscience demands it. I took ''outside'' food into a movie theater. But how could I be expected to help myself? The scent of falafel wafting out the door of Beyond Pita on Church Street here on a warm spring evening was simply too, too much for me to resist. So I didn't. And while all about moviegoers me were grinding their teeth to nubs on last year's popcorn, I was delighting in my fat little pita of delectably fried ground chickpeas and mixed bits of cabbage, tomato and pickle doused with a piquantly complicated white sesame sauce. ''The falafel is my mother's recipe, and there's nothing like your mother's food,'' the owner, Nassar Allah Arsheed (his friends call him John), 30, said of the woman who taught him to cook in his boyhood days in Israel. Indeed, food is a matter of family, and religion, for Mr. Arsheed. His St. John sub (mozzarella, roasted peppers, romaine and sun-dried tomatoes) and St. Christopher sub (portobello mushrooms, mozzarella and arugula) are listed on the menu under ''Hala's Vegetarian Specials.'' ''I dedicated these to my sister, Hala,'' he said, adding that saints were involved here because ''we are Christian.'' The shop is too small for tables so diners eat outside on nearby benches or, like me, transport the treat elsewhere. Along with falafel and subs, Mr. Arsheed sells hummus (falafel's boiled and mashed cousin), baba gannouj (roasted and pur'eed eggplant) and breakfasts like cheese omelettes and eggs, any style. (''I don't push breakfast,'' Mr. Arsheed said. ''I just serve it because I'm here cooking anyway.'')</p>
