        <p>The soft drink sat untouched, cold, sweet and inviting. Tabitha Flores, a part-time swimsuit model, stared at the sweating can as if it were a serpent trying to lure her from the Garden of Eden.</p>
        <p>''One hundred and twenty calories,'' Ms. Flores said, ''will kill you here.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Flores, sitting in a consultation room in her plastic surgeon's opulent office, lives and plays here in South Beach. She feels she must be beautiful -- svelte, taut, curvaceous, tanned and expensively styled -- to  belong in this community where striking beauty is commonplace.</p>
        <p>She had asked for a diet soda, but the sugary kind was all her doctor had. ''This Pepsi,'' she said, flashing a smile of perfect, recently bleached teeth, ''could ruin my weekend.''</p>
        <p>South Beach is utterly absorbed by beauty, peopled with fashion models and dreamers and others who just like moving about a place where bartenders pose like Grecian statues, cafe hostesses are achingly lovely, and waiters and waitresses sway blank-faced between tables as if on an invisible catwalk -- as if the ghost of Gianni Versace were looking on from a dark corner table.</p>
        <p>The southernmost tip of the city of Miami Beach, South Beach is home to several of the country's top-tier modeling agencies. This draws beautiful people -- of all colors, straight and gay -- to this fanciful place of pastel Art Deco hotels, emerald ocean and chic, throbbing nightclubs where the unpretty, uncool and unfashionable are unwelcome.</p>
        <p>''South Beach is Babylon,'' said Ms. Flores, who is also vice president of a marketing company. She is aware, she stressed, of the shallowness of it, of the kind of society this culture of beauty creates. But like so many other people here, she loves walking into it, competing, posing.</p>
        <p>''There is a cultural fixation on beauty here,'' said Scott D. Schieman, assistant professor of sociology at the University of Miami. ''It's currency,'' he said, and it determines someone's worth in the eyes of the community.</p>
        <p>''It's what rules,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It is not just the number of aspiring models who make the culture of beauty so complete here. Only a fraction of beautiful people actually make a living from their looks, from fashion shoots, cosmetics advertisements and runway jobs, say experts on the fashion industry. Yet, many live the life.</p>
        <p>They hold firm to the ritual of cosmetic surgeries, marathon workouts, endless dieting and scientific tanning, perpetuating a society based on looks: on high cheekbones, perfectly rounded breasts, sharply chiseled muscles, tiny waists and the latest fine Italian anything. Here, a plain-looking person can stand out like a pair of hip waders in a Victoria's Secret catalog.</p>
        <p>''I wear snakeskin, something showing a lot of skin, very low cut, and a drop-dead pair of stilettos,'' Ms. Flores said of her typical weekend outfit. ''It's a costume party out there. It isn't real life.''</p>
        <p>She is 5-foot-4, 112 pounds, with a 26-inch waist. She recently had her breasts augmented to a 34-C. ''You want to be looked at,'' she said. ''Here, when people look at you, you're doing pretty well.''</p>
        <p>One of the men entrusted with keeping the Beach beautiful is Baruch Jacobs, a 43-year-old cosmetic surgeon who has augmented some of its better-known bodies. There is little stigma attached to it here.</p>
        <p>''I had a patient who ordered a breast enlargement,'' Mr. Jacobs said. ''A few days before she was set for the enlargement, she decided not to. The modeling contract requested she not enlarge.'' She went ahead and bought the implants, and kept them until her two-year contract was over, he said.</p>
        <p>The difference between South Beach and other magnets for beauty -- like Los Angeles -- is the sheer concentration of it, some fashion industry experts said. South Beach is less than a mile long and a mile wide but draws beauty from all over the United States, Europe and Latin America.</p>
        <p>''We have prettied-up the landscape,'' said Jason D. Christenson, director at Wilhelmina Miami, a modeling agency here.</p>
        <p>It is also different from Los Angeles in the pure premium placed on looks. In Los Angeles, movies and television are a dream. Here, muscles are more valuable than remembering lines.</p>
        <p>''In Hollywood the waiters want to be actors,'' said Barbara Neumann, who heads the men's division at Ford Modeling Agency on South Beach. ''Here, they want to be models.''</p>
        <p>On a sweltering Saturday afternoon stretching into balmy evening, the main drag, Ocean Drive, may be the most beautiful place on the planet.</p>
        <p>It is not the buildings, or even the wide beach, where dingy sand is specked with cigarette butts and shreds of trash.</p>
        <p>The people are the view.</p>
        <p>Breathtakingly beautiful women, bursting out of bathing suits that seem made of only slightly more cotton than that in an aspirin bottle, parade past the sidewalk cafes, and bored young men in $400 Dolce &amp; Gabbana sunglasses do not even look up from $20 croissants.</p>
        <p>''If you wear J. Crew here, you look like a nun,'' Ms. Flores said.</p>
        <p>Marlboro might be America's brand, but here women hold Gauloises in languid, manicured fingers. Three men, all of whom have shaved the hair from their chests, argue in French. Yellow Ferraris prowl by.</p>
        <p>On the beach itself, men and women, much too European in their fashion sense to wear anything except black thongs, tan for hours, ignoring the puffy, pedestrian tourists and a few families with children who provide contrast for the cosmetically perfect.</p>
        <p>''What makes them so beautiful is  being beside people who are not so beautiful,'' Mr. Christenson said.</p>
        <p>As night fell, Vladimir Leiva stood on the sidewalk, passing out cards to promote a restaurant. He is so good-looking that, when women pass him, they go, ''Ooooohhhhhh.''</p>
        <p>His tan is dark and his muscles strain at a tight black shirt. His hair, the color of ink, is slicked back from a sharply defined face. He seems to have overdone his cologne, but here, too much is often barely enough.</p>
        <p>''It's like a fashion show,'' Mr. Leiva said, looking out on the evening parade of people on Ocean Drive. ''I do it for myself,'' he said of his body, wardrobe and persona. ''Beauty, image, counts a lot. There's a lot of competition.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Leiva is not a model but a clothing importer and exporter who doubles at night as a promoter at Casa Salsa, a restaurant owned by Ricky Martin, the Puerto Rican pop singer and Latin sex symbol. Like many people here, Mr. Leiva talks about the dangers of ''getting lost'' in the superficiality.</p>
        <p>''You see a lot of people using people,'' he said. ''The models come with nothing, and they're trying to make it so big. They'll do anything.''</p>
        <p>It creates an odd social dynamic. South Beach is as much about money as beauty, yet striking people who yearn for glamorous lives work in low-paying jobs to survive. Still, one cannot seem poor, or the casting calls may never come.</p>
        <p>''My friends would buy $300 shoes because it is important to have that look,'' said Vanessa Cofresi, a 27-year-old makeup artist from Puerto Rico who has been a part-time model since she was 13. ''People here look at what you wear, what car you have, who you hang around with.</p>
        <p>''You always have that in the modeling world but there's more of that here,'' Ms. Cofresi said. ''It is important to have a good-looking partner. I've had friends tell me, if he's not good looking, he shouldn't be in our group.''</p>
        <p>Lois West, associate professor of sociology at Florida International University, said the focus on beauty lends itself to a lifestyle without any real substance or intellectual depth. Many who live here concede that.</p>
        <p>''There are no books, no books anywhere,'' Ms. Flores said.</p>
        <p>But she has lived in a more serious world. A successful businesswoman who moved to South Beach from Washington last year, Ms. Flores reinvented herself.</p>
        <p>''What's important up there is what's in your brain,'' she said. ''Here, you have to be attractive first.'' She is 32, so she must work hard, she said.</p>
        <p>''I tan three, four times a week,'' Ms. Flores said. ''I work out every day. You've got to keep up your pedicures. I am constantly bleaching my teeth. I do facial peels continuously, grow my hair longer, because it's sexier. You want to have the new Cartier watch, Moschino outfits. A lot of women do it for men. I do it because it's fun.</p>
        <p>''You change how you look, but if you're not careful, the devil changes you,'' Ms. Flores said. ''South Beach is a bad habit and you keep coming back for more.''</p>
        <p>One of the most beautiful here is Sofia Vergara, featured on covers of Spanish-language magazines. But even she, whose calendar sold 500,000 copies this year, is unsure of her beauty in a sea of it. ''On the Beach,'' she said, ''you're more worried.''</p>
        <p>Of course, not everyone in South Beach is beautiful. But Hilario Machando, 86, who was cruising South Beach on his rusty bicycle with his pet Chihuahua in the basket, loves living here, anyway, and loves that God has granted him eyes to see.</p>
        <p>''My kids live in Kendall,'' he said of a Miami suburb, ''but I never go.''</p>
