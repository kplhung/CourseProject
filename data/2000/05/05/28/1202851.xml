        <p>There are three of them now in New Jersey, three surviving recipients of the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest award for valor in combat: two from World War II, one from Vietnam.</p>
        <p>Every Memorial Day, they make speeches at graveside ceremonies and march in parades. It is an obligation, they explain, that comes with the medal. And with it comes the desire to bear witness to what it is they and their comrades went through, the living and the dead.</p>
        <p>''Especially now,'' said Jack H. Jacobs, who received his medal for his service in  Vietnam, as he recently sat sipping coffee in the kitchen of his big Victorian house in Millington. Since the medal was created in 1862, there have been 3,430 recipients. ''When I first got my award, that was in '69, there were 450 living recipients. There are now fewer than 150.</p>
        <p>''Well, you have the sense there's not going to be anyone around to pass on the testimony,'' he said. ''And maybe we have an obligation to pass that on.''</p>
        <p>Aug. 27, 1944, near Montelimar, France: The citation for Stephen R. Gregg, then a 30-year-old Army technical sergeant, says he made a solitary charge up a hill through falling hand grenades and bullets, firing a .30-caliber machine gun from his hip as he went so that medics could rescue seven wounded soldiers.</p>
        <p>Jan, 23, 1945, near Tettington, Germany: The citation for Nicholas Oresko, then a 28-year old, 5-foot-4 infantry technical sergeant, says he singlehandedly knocked out two machine gun nests that had pinned down his company -- including one after a slug tore through his hip and came out near his spine.</p>
        <p>March 9, 1968, Kien Phong Province, Republic of Vietnam: Mr. Jacobs's citation says that the first lieutenant, then 22, pulled 14 wounded men to safety during an ambush  (he is 5 feet 3 inches tall) and fought off and killed several Viet Cong soldiers as he conducted the rescue, even as blood from a head wound impaired his vision.</p>
        <p>''The citation,'' said Mr. Oresko, as he sat in his modest, impeccably kept Cape Cod house in Tenafly, ''doesn't say how you felt.''</p>
        <p>''You're numb,'' Mr. Oresko, an 83-year-old widower, said. ''You're not in your right mind, really. You move by instinct.''</p>
        <p>Sergeant Oresko, a refinery worker from Bayonne, was in charge of a platoon ordered to destroy machine guns that were stopping the American advance. Thinking about it, he sees the snow on the ground again, the mist rising. The cold permeates his bones. He gives the order. No one moves. His men know it's sure death. He gives it again. No one moves.</p>
        <p>''I said to myself, 'Well someone has to go,' '' he recalled. ''So ''I decided to go myself. And I looked up at heaven and said, 'Lord, I know I'm going to die. Let's make it fast.'''</p>
        <p>And 30 feet up the hill, he turns to see his men beginning to follow.</p>
        <p>Stephen Gregg also felt he was going to die. He had come through the landing at Salerno and rugged mountain fighting in Italy and, now here in France, this former shipyard welder was touched by the cries of the seven wounded riflemen.</p>
        <p>''We were close by, and you could hear the men that were hit calling for medics,'' said Mr. Gregg, a dignified man of 85, as he sat at the dining room table in his comfortable home in his native Bayonne.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'God! I've got to do something here,' he said. ''I don't know what got into me, but I picked up this gun.</p>
        <p>''I kept firing and firing,'' he said. ''I was just thinking, 'I've got to get as many as I can, before they get me.' I never thought I'd come out of this thing alive to be frank with you. The Lord was with me.''</p>
        <p>For Jack Jacobs, 55, who had gotten his commission through the R.O.T.C. program at Rutgers, thoughts about what he felt the day of the ambush are complicated. He was an advisor to a Vietnamese Army battalion, walking in a rice paddy in the Mekong Delta, when he heard the phhhht of a mortar.</p>
        <p>''It's exploding but you don't hear it at all,'' he said in the quiet of his kitchen. ''All I felt was a big rush of hot air, being lifted up, and the next thing I knew I was on my hands and knees, and blood is just pouring out onto the ground.''</p>
        <p>His first reaction was, this isn't happening. His second, it's happening but he's not badly wounded. Then, it's happening and he is badly wounded.</p>
        <p>''I was convinced I was going to die,'' he said. Then, he recalled, ''My thought was if somebody doesn't do something, then we would all surely die.''</p>
        <p>The South Vietnamese officers had been incapacitated and he quickly took command. Then he began dragging the wounded to the safety of the treeline.</p>
        <p>Mr. Oresko received his Medal of Honor from President Truman, Mr. Jacobs from President Nixon. Mr. Gregg received his from a general on the battlefield and went back into combat. He later received a citation in the mail from President Roosevelt.</p>
        <p>A long time has passed since their moments of extraordinary courage, moments that still baffle them, leaves them wondering how they did it and even whether they deserved the medal.</p>
        <p>''You feel you were just lucky,'' said Mr. Oresko. ''When you read the other citations you say, 'Wow! Look what they did.'''</p>
        <p>It was a moment that shaped their lives and in many ways defined who they were and who they were to become.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gregg took a job with the Hudson County Sheriff's Department offered by Mayor Frank Hague, the legendary county Democratic boss, and retired as a chief of court officers after 51 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Oresko took advantage of a presidential order that provided jobs in the Veterans Administration to Medal of Honor recipients; he retired as a supervisor after 32 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jacobs retired as a colonel after 20 years in the Army -- including another tour in Vietnam -- and became an international banker.</p>
        <p>Along the way, they all had children, and in the case of Mr. Gregg and Mr. Jacobs, grandchildren.</p>
        <p>The men attend conventions of the the society of Medal of Honor winners as well as presidential inaugurations and other events where people from generals to the average citizen inevitably ask to shake their hands. They have had parades in their honor, as well as streets named after them, and, in Mr. Gregg's case a county park in Bayonne.</p>
        <p>''Ninety-seven acres,'' Irene Gregg, his wife, called from the kitchen.</p>
        <p>But on a deeper level, said Mr. Jacobs, his actions in war also changed his view of life.</p>
        <p>''I always felt like a very small cog in a very large machine, and I think most people do,'' said Mr. Jacobs. ''My experience in the war changed that. I realized that people can actually make a difference.''</p>
