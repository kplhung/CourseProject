        <p>Mosharaf Sarder was bleeding money as he stepped out of the bathroom and looked around for his fish sandwich.</p>
        <p>''I should charge you one dollar for every minute,'' he said to Maqsood Ahmad, who was standing behind the counter of Lahore Deli. Mr. Ahmad pulled the sandwich out of a microwave and shoved it toward Mr. Sarder.</p>
        <p>The cabby from Bangladesh ripped into his dinner. Every minute spent in the deli was a minute he could have been getting a fare. For him, time was measured in the shifting display of red digits on his meter.</p>
        <p>''People are out there in Brooklyn, in Queens, in the Bronx,'' he said. It was Saturday night, usually a good time for picking up riders.</p>
        <p>''How did you do tonight?'' asked a cabby who was sipping chai on a vinyl bar stool.</p>
        <p>''I started at 8 o'clock,'' Mr. Sarder said. ''One fare Queens, one fare Brooklyn.''</p>
        <p>''That's it?''</p>
        <p>''That's it!''</p>
        <p>''Now they're comparing what's in their pockets,'' Mr. Ahmad, the deli owner, said to a visitor who was watching the exchange.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ahmad has listened in on hundreds of conversations like this. The cabbies have been stopping in since 1995, when he opened the 24-hour deli. They come for the samosas and the dhal, the basmati rice and the cool lhassi drinks. The meat is halal, and nothing costs more than $3. Not even the hundreds of cassettes of Hindi and Urdu pop music stacked against a wall, or the videotapes of dance numbers from those epic-length, Bombay-produced movies called Bollywood musicals.</p>
        <p>Above the door hangs a hand-painted wooden sign with the deli's name scrawled in red Roman letters and flowing Urdu script. At any time of day, a couple of yellow cabs wait outside on Crosby Street.</p>
        <p>Sandwiched between lofts and boutiques, the tiny shop stands across from the Gaseteria at Houston and Broadway, where cabbies hand off their cars during shift changes. Culinary connoisseurs would never mistake its cuisine for that of the Savoy or Balthazar, both down the block. But this is a place that the drivers can call their own, a four-stool joint where a Bollywood video always plays and packets of aspirin are sold at the counter.</p>
        <p>''They all have headaches,'' Mr. Ahmad said. ''They use a lot of painkillers.'' He also sells rolls of meter paper, batteries for cell phones and pagers, and paper towels for wiping windshields -- one-stop shopping for cabbies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ahmad knows that smiles are rare in the taxi business. He worked as a cabby on and off for three years before opening the deli. Driving was tough, but it was better money than the odd jobs he held after moving to New York in 1990 from Lahore, Pakistan: security guard, textile factory worker, newsstand salesman. Then in 1995, his wife joined him in New York and told him that if he opened a deli, she would do the cooking.</p>
        <p>''She makes home-style food,'' Mr. Ahmad said.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Ahmad, running the deli beats driving a cab. In the taxi business, for every 10 good customers, there was one bad one, he said. Like the man who once told him to run a stop sign because he was in a rush. Mr. Ahmad did so, only to get slammed by another car.</p>
        <p>''Only the good drivers survive,'' he said. ''There's a lot of tension because they have to pay their lease, and a lot of stress from their customers.''</p>
        <p>A driver who had just walked out of the bathroom, his hands dripping water, heard Mr. Ahmad telling this to a visitor.</p>
        <p>''When they are outside the cab, they are polite,'' the driver, Zafar Ali, said. ''When they get in, they think they are the boss.''</p>
        <p>That was on top of the other headaches, he said. No parking spaces on the street. Fifty-five dollar fines for double parking. No public bathrooms. Mr. Ali pointed over his shoulder, where there was a line six deep just to get into the deli bathroom. It had been like that all night.</p>
        <p>Then there was the recent spate of cabdriver murders. Ten men had already been killed this year.</p>
        <p>''I think about 10 to 15 percent of the drivers have quit their jobs because of the dangerous situation in this city,'' Mr. Ahmad said as he threw chick peas into a blender.</p>
        <p>''I say it is 25 percent,'' said an Indian driver known as Clinton. ''A lot of my friends have gone to limousines.''</p>
        <p>''Yeah, maybe 25 percent,'' Mr. Ahmad said. ''That sounds right.''</p>
        <p>Clinton nodded. He shoveled another spoonful of rice and dhal into his mouth. No one here knows his real name. Everyone calls him Clinton because he once had a girlfriend named Monica.</p>
        <p>A particularly catchy Bollywood tune called ''Kuch Kuch Hota Hai'' began playing on the television. It had been the most popular song last summer on the Indian subcontinent. Mr. Sarder finished the last bite of his fish sandwich and stared at the beautiful dancing actors, his thoughts seemingly lost amid the heat and dust of another land.</p>
        <p>Then he hopped off the stool and walked out into the rain-slicked streets of a night that was already half over, a packet of aspirin in his hand.</p>
