        <p>Iran's new reformer-dominated Parliament opened today in Tehran, the first since the Islamic revolution to include a majority of members who appear eager and ready to challenge the conservative clergy's dictates over daily life.</p>
        <p>But the difficulties facing the young reform movement, which has seen 18 independent newspapers closed down and a number of its liberal activists jailed in the last month by hard-line judges, were clearly visible in the chamber during the opening ceremonies.</p>
        <p>Only 249 of the 290 seats in the Parliament were filled. The empty seats represented districts where the conservative Council of Guardians either has not yet certified election results or has voided the victories of reform candidates who won in the first round of voting on Feb. 18.</p>
        <p>The council only approved partial results of the heavily pro-reform vote in the capital, Tehran, last week, and then only at the command of Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. New elections for vacant seats have not yet been scheduled.</p>
        <p>The machinations over the composition of the new Parliament, the sixth since the Shah was overthrown and replaced with a theocratic leadership in 1979, reflected the broader conflict between entrenched religious conservatives and the impatient pro-democracy movement supporting President Mohammad Khatami.</p>
        <p>Mr. Khatami, a moderate cleric elected in a landslide vote in 1997, has advocated democratic reforms, a free press and the depoliticizing of the judiciary and security forces, which are dominated by hard-liners.</p>
        <p>While he has been able to form a liberal cabinet to his liking, he has accomplished little in the way of legislation. The previous Parliament was controlled by conservatives.</p>
        <p>The new Parliament, which includes a record low number of only 37 Muslim clerics, will also have to take conservative resistance to any reforms into account. The Council of Guardians, in addition to its power over elections, also must approve all legislation.</p>
        <p>But President Khatami told the new legislators today that they have the responsibility to debate and look into all areas of Iranian life and government.</p>
        <p>''This is a Parliament that has a heavy responsibility and must play a fundamental role in stabilizing the system,'' Mr. Khatami said.</p>
        <p>Political analysts in Iran estimate that up to 70 percent of the new members of Parliament are sympathetic to Mr. Khatami or directly allied to him, although they represent a wide variety of views on such matters as press freedom, or how to rescue the economy and reduce unemployment in the overwhelmingly young country.</p>
        <p>Some, although not all, reformers have said they want to ease restrictions on books, music, satellite television receivers and the press, for example. Others have said the first priority for the new Parliament should be to help expand political activity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Khatami's aides have said they want to move slowly to avoid further antagonizing conservatives.</p>
        <p>''The Parliament must amend the laws in such a way as to pave the way for democratization of the country,'' said Abbas Abdi, a leading reform activist and writer. ''It must pass laws that provide security and political stability. Without these, economic reform will not be possible.''</p>
        <p>The potential disputes that lay ahead remained in the background at the opening session, which became instead a moment of defiant celebration for Khatami forces.</p>
        <p>Abdolvahab Massavi Lari, the Minister of Interior and a close ally of the president, gave a long speech in which he openly expressed irritation with the way the Council of Guardians handled the parliamentary elections. Criticism of the council, appointed directly by the country's supreme religious leader, had long been taboo in Iran.</p>
        <p>Several new members of Parliament also demonstrated their iconoclastic leanings. All the 11 women members appeared in headscarves and shapeless long coats, as required of Iranian women in public places.</p>
        <p>But two of them, Tahereh Rezazadeh from Shiraz and Elaheh Koulai from Tehran, did not cover themselves with the additional black square of fabric -- called the chador -- that has been the established uniform for women who are members of Parliament and, indeed, any woman entering a government building, since the revolution.</p>
