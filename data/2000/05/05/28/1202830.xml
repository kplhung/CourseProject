        <p>OF all the world's well-worn romantic pilgrimage routes, perhaps none is more potholed than the road to Paris.

        <p>OF all the world's well-worn romantic pilgrimage routes, perhaps none is more potholed than the road to Paris. There are couples who come here for the first time to get engaged or even marry; some feel more in love in Paris and never recover from the hangover once they go. If you fall for Paris first, you might find love among the natives, for what is a native but another part of the scenery? But a Frenchman can't share your Paris dream, and it might be his incomprehension that drives you into the arms of a starry-eyed Englishman -- who tells you why he came to Paris in a sidewalk cafe on your first night together by motioning in the amber-lit air: ''For this.'' Dreamers of the same dream -- heroin addicts, mountain-biking fanatics, husband-and-wife political teams as well as expatriates -- often find themselves tied as much to the dream as to each other, all the edges of loyalty and desire blurred and inextricable.</p>
        <p>Films like ''The Talented Mr. Ripley,''  ''The Beach,''  ''Out of Africa,''  ''The Sheltering Sky'' and the recently released ''I Dreamed of Africa'' have attempted to explore what happens when people join hands and parachute into the wilderness of a shared dream. Those who chase their fantasies to Paris or Kenya, Thailand or Morocco usually learn that dreams are promises waiting to be broken: love in a new climate withers as often as it blooms.</p>
        <p>In some films, the exotic locations of our romantic imaginings are used like the cheap trick of a pink lightbulb, to add a glow to an ordinary love story: the incidental geography that throws Katharine Hepburn and Humphrey Bogart together on a steamboat in ''The African Queen'' or lands Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke in the same European train cabin in ''Before Sunrise.''</p>
        <p>But the romance between the characters played by Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow in ''The Talented Mr. Ripley'' seems a perfect complement to the idyllic Italian scenery. They frolic on the beach and sip martinis on the terrace, their love heightened by the backdrop of an endless playground. But the luminous surfaces of the film's Italian vistas only emphasize the discrepancy between appearance and reality for Americans who have left their moral compasses in another time zone.</p>
        <p>It is not just Tom Ripley (Matt Damon) who comes between them, it is the dream of paradise itself. Mr. Law's Dickie is so ruthless in his pursuit of pleasure that he forgets that no amount of cash, charm or beauty can save him. Blinded by the delirious whims of possibility, far from home, it can be hard to see the danger signs. To remember that our chosen paradises are indifferent to our wills and desires. At best, they allow us to pass through them unscathed. Sometimes, they swallow us whole.</p>
        <p>In Sydney Pollack's 1985 film, ''Out of Africa,'' based on Isak Dinesen's memoirs, Karen Blixen (Meryl Streep) sets her sights on anywhere. ''We might be all right,'' the weary Dane tells the man she hopes will come along for the ride, ''and if we fail, at least we'd have been somewhere.''</p>
        <p>But the punishing tests of East Africa, like any challenging, unfamiliar territory, have a way of breaking weak ties. Their bond doesn't strengthen in Kenya, it tears. She resigns herself to making her coffee crop grow and fighting lions and putting out her own fires. It is when she seems most alone that true love appears, in the form of Denys Finch Hatton (Robert Redford), a solitary veteran of the landscape.</p>
        <p>Inviting her on the safaris he usually takes alone, he tells her: ''I wanted to show you these things. I thought you'd understand them.''</p>
        <p>Together and in their own separate ways they pour their hearts into Africa. And when he takes her up in his two-seater airplane to give her ''a glimpse of the world through God's eyes,'' they hold hands in the sky, suspended with Africa in a moment of eternal grace.</p>
        <p>When Denys dies and the farm burns, so does the dream life of Africa. ''If I knew a song about Africa,'' she reflects years later, ''does Africa know a song of me? Will the air over the plain quiver with a color that I have had on? Or will the children invent a game in which my name is? Or will the full moon throw a shadow over the gravel of the drive that was like me? Or will the eagles of the Ngong hills look out for me?''</p>
        <p>It is impossible to view Hugh Hudson's much less affecting ''I Dreamed of Africa'' without drawing comparisons. The film is about Kuki and Paolo Gallmann, a real-life Italian couple (played, jarringly, by Kim Basinger and Vincent Perez, speaking in their respective American and French accents), who pursue a mutual fantasy of life in Kenya.</p>
        <p>Paolo has returned to the land of his boyhood and is drawn to the risk and adventure that eluded him in Italy -- and that take him away from home for weeks at a time. Kuki has naively come in search of a ''new life,'' in which she imagines their shared adventure will bring them together. But she soon learns how the demands of a place can take away as much hope as they give. Feeling abandoned, she consoles herself with passing such homebound tests as driving an elephant from her garden. No, this is not the Africa she dreamed about.</p>
        <p>THE Gallmanns grapple with their expectations, learning such trite lessons as how to submit to the new ''rhythm'' of Africa. But the film most reveals how two people can never share exactly the same dream. Their Africa feels more like an infidelity, each person alone with a harsh and tempting mistress.</p>
        <p>Kuki loses her husband and young son to the unknown dangers of foreign soil, but she stays on in Africa as the film ends -- and before we can witness the real growth that must accompany such a loss.</p>
        <p>That ''I Dreamed of Africa'' fails to engage us in the reality of these people's experience -- despite a compelling story and a camera-ready landscape -- illustrates that in this age of stale, overpublicized fantasies, it requires a subtle hand to convey the dream logic that leads people to forsake their given lives for the sound of a single word: Paris, Africa, America. From the armchair, it is easy to see each journey as an escape, a tired trek down a predictable path. Only passion makes a journey new.</p>
        <p>In the opening scene of Bernardo Bertolucci's adaptation of Paul Bowles's ''Sheltering Sky'' (1990), Port (John Malkovich) explains the difference between a tourist and a traveler: a tourist is just passing  through, whereas the traveler moves from one place to the next, perhaps never to find his way back. For the rich dilettante, wandering the earth is his sole occupation, his only religion. He studies maps and follows the wind and does not stop. ''My only plan is: I have no plan,'' he says.</p>
        <p>He might be a born dreamer, but it's a journey he does not want to make alone. Port's wife, Kit (Debra Winger), follows along, simply enduring the transience of their troubled union in the hope that they will one day end up back home in New York. ''Don't you ever think we should stop?'' she asks him. ''Stay somewhere just for a while?'' When he falls ill with typhoid in the middle of rural Africa, she scolds, ''If you just stay in one place for a while, you'll be fine.''</p>
        <p>But it is too late for that. Kit has been waiting out Port's wanderlust, hoping to return to real life one day soon -- as if real life were not just the sum of all our days. Port has always known that he might not go home again.</p>
        <p>''Because we don't know when we will die, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well,'' says Mr. Bowles, the narrator, at the end of the film. ''Yet everything happens only a certain number of times, and a very small number, really. How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood, some afternoon that's so deeply a part of your being that you can't even conceive of your life without it? Perhaps four or five times more. Perhaps not even that. How many more times will you watch the full moon rise? Perhaps 20. And yet it all seems limitless.''</p>
        <p>PERHAPS every journey is at its heart a battle against limits, a vain attempt to trick destiny into giving us more than our share of lives.</p>
        <p>In Danny Boyle's film ''The Beach,'' Leonardo DiCaprio isn't just seduced by the dream of paradise; he wants someone to share it with, and breaks up the happy French couple played by Virginie Ledoyen and Guillaume Canet. By the end, we're pretty sure he'll hold onto the girl, but paradise has been lost. In Mr. Bertolucci's ''Stealing Beauty'' (1996), Liv Tyler is busy trying to art-direct the loss of her virginity at a beautiful Tuscan villa, the home of a couple beginning to wonder whether they might be snapping out of their expatriate dreams.</p>
        <p>For it seems that three rarely last long in the bed. The man with whom you once shared your love for Paris might leave you both for the Cote-d'Ivoire. But even if you stay on forever, Paris will never love you back. We can't really lose our hearts to places near or far. It is human love, in the end, that breaks us. In ''The Last Time I Saw Paris'' (1954), the city is just the resting place for Elizabeth Taylor and Van Johnson's great unraveled expectations. If Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman will always have Paris, it is only because they have lost each other for good in ''Casablanca.'' Paradise isn't necessarily where we end up: it's where we've been; where we're about to go. Sometimes there is nothing left to do but get the map out.</p>
