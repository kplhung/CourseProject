        <p>Christine Lincoln's journey to Washington College, a small liberal arts institution in Chestertown, Md., was as circuitous as it was perilous.</p>
        <p>And she is as amazed as anyone that she is alive, let alone the recipient of one of the best-endowed literary prizes bestowed on an undergraduate. The award, which she received from a faculty committee at commencement last Sunday, is $54,266 and named for Sophie Kerr, a pioneering female journalist and author.</p>
        <p>Asked to recall her adolescent self, Ms. Lincoln, who is 34, said: ''I was getting into fights. I was using drugs. I started out with marijuana and alcohol, probably at 13. By the time I was 17, I was using anything -- cocaine, uppers and downers, diet pills.''</p>
        <p>In 1984, which should have been her senior year at Baltimore City College High School, she was expelled. Though she would attend and graduate from another school the next year, her drug abuse would not abate.</p>
        <p>Feeling she needed to escape ''the streets, and my friends,'' Ms. Lincoln enlisted in the Air Force. But a brief window of sobriety in basic training slammed shut on assignments at Andrews and Dover Air Force Bases, where she worked as a radiology technician. By a miracle, she secured an honorable discharge in 1991, but the next year she grew so depressed that, one night, she swallowed ''every pill that was in my house and took all the alcohol I could get my hands on.''</p>
        <p>''I was so angry when I woke up,'' she said, ''that I was alive.''</p>
        <p>A 30-day stay in a rehabilitation center in Texas was followed, a year later, by the birth of her son, Takii, who was beset with medical problems and required several operations in his early years.</p>
        <p>In 1995, her son healthy and her sobriety holding, Ms. Lincoln began thinking about her life. And, like the memory of a soft breeze from a long-ago vacation, she remembered being a 9-year-old who was told by a teacher, ''Chris, you're a writer,'' after she submitted a short story in which she had bestowed human qualities on a house.</p>
        <p>And so she began taking English courses at Baltimore City Community College. While there, Ms. Lincoln read a newspaper article about the writing program at Washington College, and its Sophie Kerr prize. She decided on the spot to apply, and resolved to obtain scholarship money to cover the $20,000 annual tuition. Captivated by her spirit and history, the college agreed.</p>
        <p>At Washington, which is two hours from Baltimore, Ms. Lincoln discovered Somerset Maugham ('' 'Of Human Bondage,' God, I loved that''), Toni Morrison (''Everything she's ever written''), and, to her surprise, Sylvia Plath (''When I took that poetry class, I thought, 'Man, I'm not a poet,' but she blew me away. She's so real.' '')</p>
        <p>More important, she found her own voice, spinning yarns of rural life that increasingly centered on struggling African-American survivors like herself. Her first story, ''The Music,'' tells of a family reeling in denial amid persistent physical abuse. In ''Sap Rising,'' a young woman agonizes over whether to accept the hand of a downtrodden farmer not unlike her father, or follow the clarion call of a faraway land.</p>
        <p>This fall, her bank account newly flush, Ms. Lincoln intends to pack up her son and begin her own adventure, moving to South Africa, which she first visited on a college trip. She will study African literature and work in a program in Johannesburg that uses creative writing to ''heal teenagers traumatized by violence.'' She is also working on a novel, and hoping that a publisher will purchase her collection of short stories.</p>
        <p>''The possibilities for my life are endless,'' she says.</p>
