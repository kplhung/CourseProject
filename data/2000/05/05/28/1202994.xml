        <p>The Middlesex and Somerset County freeholders last week reached an agreement on sharing the local costs for the Green Brook Flood Control Project, which could mean the project, which has been debated since 1973, will be started by fall. The $331 million project, which involves dredging, bridge reconstruction and building flood walls and levees, should control severe flooding problems in Bound Brook, Middlesex Borough, Green Brook, North Plainfield and Piscataway. Somerset has agreed to pay $11 million and Middlesex $9.6 million toward the cost. The project will take at least four years.</p>
