        <p>BECAUSE the Asian long-horned beetle has been found to be spreading in the New York metropolitan area, Connecticut state scientists are urging property owners to inspect their trees, particularly their maple trees, for the beetles.</p>
        <p>''The extremely destructive beetle has been found in the New York metropolitan region, on Long Island and in Chicago,'' said Dr. Louis A. Magnarelli, of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. ''Over 6,000 trees have been destroyed in those places in an attempt to stop the spread of the beetle, but it could have already spread to Connecticut,'' he said.</p>

        <p>BECAUSE the Asian long-horned beetle has been found to be spreading in the New York metropolitan area, Connecticut state scientists are urging property owners to inspect their trees, particularly their maple trees, for the beetles.</p>
        <p>''The extremely destructive beetle has been found in the New York metropolitan region, on Long Island and in Chicago,'' said Dr. Louis A. Magnarelli, of the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station. ''Over 6,000 trees have been destroyed in those places in an attempt to stop the spread of the beetle, but it could have already spread to Connecticut,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For now, the beetles are 50 miles from the Connecticut-New York border and have yet to be spotted in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>''If the beetles were to become established in the state's forests they have the potential to leave large swaths of dead maples,'' said Dr. Jeffrey S. Ward, a station forester whose job is to monitor the health of the state forests. ''The impact would be as devastating as the loss of American elm and chestnut during the past century,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ward said 40 percent of the state's trees are maples and their destruction would ''even more dramatically alter the forests and cities that depend on the trees for landscaping and shade.'' ''The brightest most vibrant colors of the fall foliage come from the maples,'' he added. ''Without maples fall foliage would be vastly diminished.''</p>
        <p>In New York State the beetles have been attacking maple species including Norway, red, sugar, silver, boxelder and sycamore maples. Other known hosts are other hardwood trees such as horse chestnut, black locust, elms, birches, willows, poplars and green ash.</p>
        <p>''There is no effective insecticide for the beetle,'' Dr. Magnarelli said. ''The only way of controlling an infestation is to destroy affected trees by chipping or burning. The only chance we have to stop this is to have as many informed alerted property owners as possible looking for infested trees.''</p>
        <p>The Asian long-horned beetle is about an inch long, shiny black with bright white spots. The beetle has long, curved antennae that are longer than the beetle's body. In May the adult beetle emerges from deep inside an affected tree. When the beetles emerge from the trees they leave visible exit holes. The diameter of the hole ranges from a quarter-inch to a half-inch.</p>
        <p>Beneath the exit holes, or in the branch crotches, piles of frass (insect waste and sawdust) may accumulate. The exit holes often bleed large amounts of sap. Defoliation and leaf damage appear when the juvenile beetles deep in the tree bore through the trees' tissues that carry water and nutrients to the trees' crowns. (Trees die from the crowns down.)</p>
        <p>Station inspectors equipped with binoculars are searching for beetle-damaged trees throughout the state and this month they are doing surveillance almost every week day. Other inspectors are viewing aerial photos that would show a pattern of leaf damage indicating the beetles' presence. ''We're looking in areas that have high concentrations of maple trees,'' said the deputy state entomologist, Carol R. Lemmon. ''We're looking for any signs of defoliation or leaf damage particularly in the crowns of trees.</p>
        <p>''I'm really scared this beetle will establish itself in Connecticut and take off,'' Dr. Lemmon said.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Magnarelli said the situation isn't hopeless. ''We have some things going for us,'' he said. ''Although the beetle can fly as much as half a mile when it emerges in May, it usually re-infests the tree it emerged from or infests a nearby tree. It won't spread as fast as a gypsy moth infestation. It seems like the beetle only infests trees that are already stressed.''</p>
        <p>But for the last 20 years the Connecticut forest has been subjected to a series of harsh environmental stresses, Dr. Lemmon said. In the 1980's, gypsy moths defoliated trees throughout the state, there was a record drought during the summer of 1995 followed by the heavy snows of the winter of 1995-96. The warm winters and wet springs of 1997 and 1998 produced fungal blights on leaves, which further stressed the forest and resulted in muted fall foliage. Then there was last summer's record drought, she said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ward continued: ''Trees in cities are always subject to high level of stress and may be particularly susceptible to the beetle. If the beetle were to become established, the cost of removing and replacing the trees and the decline in real estate values will have a severe economic effect in addition to the severe esthetic effects.''</p>
        <p>Maple, beech, hemlock and birch are known as the old-growth species. They are tree species that in many ways define the forest as we know it, Dr. Ward said. ''Beech trees are presently being attacked by beech bark disease complex, the hemlocks are being devastated by the woolley adelgid,'' he said. ''If the beetle were to establish itself in the state's maple trees, three of the four old growth species will be greatly diminished. What a mess this would cause.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Lemmon said the beetle has no known predators in China. There is some evidence that the beetle came from somewhere else and arrived in China relatively recently. (The beetle came to the United States in wooden crates sent from China.) Although the beetle was found to be in the United States in 1996 there is evidence that it has been in the United States since 1989. The beetle has been found in the New York metropolitan area, Amityville, N. Y. and Chicago. It is possible, Dr. Lemmon said, that trees are infested elsewhere but the beetle has not yet been detected.</p>
        <p>In the end, dying infested trees can be dangerous to life and property, Dr. Ward said. The trees become weak and brittle as they are being eaten by the beetles and large branches can break away, especially during wind storms. For those reasons, Dr. Ward said it is important to find infested trees as soon as possible and destroy them.</p>
        <p>If someone finds an Asian longhorned beetle, he or she should keep the specimen for identification and call the Department of Entomology (203) 974-8474 or 974-8600. An inspector will respond to the call.</p>
