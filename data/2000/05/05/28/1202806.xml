        <p>THE world hailed the coloratura soprano as the ''Swedish Nightingale.'' Phineas Taylor Barnum came to know and affectionately dub her the ''Divine Jenny.''</p>
        <p>Jenny Lind made her formal operatic debut at the Stockholm Royal Theater in 1837 at the age of 17, continuing to sing and enhance her reputation throughout Europe. Although Barnum had never seen or heard her, the impresario recognized her star quality potential and arranged for her American concert debut.</p>
        <p>''P. T. Barnum presents the Divine Jenny Lind,'' an exhibition at the Barnum Museum in Bridgeport through Aug. 13, celebrates the 150th anniversary of Lind's American concert tour in 1850. It recounts the Jenny Lind phenomenon and its impact on Barnum's career.</p>
        <p>''Barnum had a knack for turning characters into celebrities,'' said Barbara Kram, the museum's executive director, recalling the cast: ''Tom Thumb, Chang &amp; Eng, the Siamese twins, the Fiji mermaid and Joice Heth whom Barnum claimed was 161 years old, and had been George Washington's nursemaid. (She was actually 71.) There was Lavinia Warren, Tom Thumb's bride, their wedding turned into a giant spectacle. Jenny Lind was one of Barnum's most successful promotions.''</p>
        <p>The exhibition is arranged as a romantic ode to Jenny Lind in a second floor blue Victorian gallery. It's divided into six chronological sections ranging from ''P. T. Barnum: A Time for Change,'' to ''Lind Mania: The Industrialization of a Nightingale.'' The story is brought to life with interpretive vignettes -- costumed mannequins parading as Jenny Lind against mural-sized backgrounds, one of her arrival in New York harbor, another her premiere sellout concert on Sept. 11, 1850 in the Castle Garden at Battery Park, Manhattan, thronged with more than 5,000 admirers.</p>
        <p>''Barnum was an acute analyst of American society in tune with its social tempo,'' said Kathleen Maher, the museum's curator responsible for the exhibition's concept. ''He recognized the need to reform the entertainment industry.''</p>
        <p>During and before the 1850's, theater attracted mainly rowdy male audiences. But Barnum, in his American Museum in Manhattan, created a lecture room where watered-down versions of ''Uncle Tom's Cabin'' and Shakespearean plays were performed with happy endings. ''This reformation of the theater was a way of encouraging women and families to attend,'' Ms. Maher said. ''Matinee performances were an added hook.''</p>
        <p>Barnum, the showman who catered to the masses, was eager to elevate the level of entertainment as well as his own social position. ''He met with heads of state in Europe and seemed poised for greatness here,'' Ms. Maher reflected. ''Ms. Lind's talent was unquestionable, her reputation enshrined on the Continent and in England and Barnum saw in her the perfect mantel for his next enormous venture.''</p>
        <p>While musical entertainment was not flourishing in the United States in the 1850's, Barnum's instinct was that her innocence and brilliant voice were the perfect package.</p>
        <p>Their contract, signed on Nov. 8, 1850, when Ms. Lind was 30, is displayed, his signature surprisingly modest, hers more flourishing. The promotional guru had six months to prepare the American public for the arrival of the Swedish Nightingale. To build anticipation he held advance ticket auctions in each of her concert cities.</p>
        <p>Concert posters, vignettes, portraits, everything from sheet music to objects representing the industrialization of Jenny Lind are here. ''There were no rights or restrictions in using Jenny Lind's name or image, so manufacturers and shop owners freely used her success as a tool to sell products,'' Ms. Maher said. ''She did endorse a riding hat, shown on a billboard.''</p>
        <p>Other objects with her iconography include a dressing table mirror, a bronze bell, books, girandoles, bonnets, tobacco boxes, figures, stoves, paper and porcelain dolls and a three-foot marble bust of her image, which Barnum commissioned for his home and bequeathed to the Barnum Museum.</p>
        <p>In ''Humbug, the Art of P. T. Barnum,'' the author Neil Harris refers to Barnum's artfulness in bringing together various images of Ms. Lind -- that of a modest, benevolent girl, of a Nordic spellbinder and shepherdess, all subordinated to an image of innocence. ''It was the spirit of Artlessness presided over by the Spirit of Artifice,'' he writes, ''and Americans loved it.''</p>
        <p>The Barnum Museum (820 Main Street, Bridgeport; 203-331-1104) is open Tuesday through Saturday, 10 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. and Sunday, noon to 4:30 p.m.</p>
