        <p>There was the Indiana Pacers' Rik Smits, a 7-foot-4-inch lumbering blond who was rooted on the baseline like a sequoia, preparing to release a jumper from the clouds. But on one amazing leap of faith, the knee-high Charlie Ward darted into the picture, scaled an imaginary beanstalk and slapped the shot into the seats.</p>
        <p>A flash of disbelief crossed Smits's face as he watched Ward pick himself up, untangle his feet from the camera cords and scamper back onto the court amid the noise from the delirious beholders at Madison Square Garden.

Because just as they did last year, the Knicks turned the impossible into the attainable yesterday.</p>

        <p>There was the Indiana Pacers' Rik Smits, a 7-foot-4-inch lumbering blond who was rooted on the baseline like a sequoia, preparing to release a jumper from the clouds. But on one amazing leap of faith, the knee-high Charlie Ward darted into the picture, scaled an imaginary beanstalk and slapped the shot into the seats.</p>
        <p>A flash of disbelief crossed Smits's face as he watched Ward pick himself up, untangle his feet from the camera cords and scamper back onto the court amid the noise from the delirious beholders at Madison Square Garden. Smits should know better by now. He should expect miracles, catch them coming out of the corners of his eyes. Because just as they did last year, the Knicks turned the impossible into the attainable yesterday.</p>
        <p>On an afternoon when Patrick Ewing was in a suit because of a foot injury and an injured Marcus Camby had been taken to a hospital because of a knee injury, the Knicks simply reached a little higher. With helium in their bones and desperation in their blood, the Knicks opened their sequel to last year's improbable playoff run against the Indiana Pacers with a 98-95 Game 3 victory.</p>
        <p>Game 4 in the Eastern Conference finals is tomorrow at 5:30 p.m. at the Garden.</p>
        <p>Yesterday was a day for rediscovery. In one afternoon, the Knicks remembered how to channel adversity into victory and closed the Pacers' advantage in this four-of-seven-game series to two games to one. With one performance, Latrell Sprewell decoded his late-game disappearances. For a month, he wondered how his touch could evaporate so easily, how his shots could so routinely bang off the rim with a sickening beat. But inside the Garden, in front of his support group, Sprewell found his rhythm again as he rode the Knicks' up-tempo approach for a 32-point performance.</p>
        <p>His partner was right by his side. After struggling in Games 1 and 2, Allan Houston would not fall prey to the theatrical Reggie Miller as he side-stepped foul trouble and stayed on the floor to produce 28 points in 45 minutes.</p>
        <p>''I just thought Allan and I were very aggressive,'' Sprewell said. ''We felt really good. We got into a rhythm. The one thing about this team, we are very resilient. Today, we were completely together. We weren't going to get down, no matter who was or who wasn't on the floor. That's just how this team is.''</p>
        <p>It's almost as if the Knicks need adversity to breathe. Four minutes into the second quarter, they got a second helping of it. Driving hard to his right, Camby planted on his right foot, slipping into a split, and had to be helped off the floor after spraining the medial capsule in his right knee. He did not return to the game, and his availability for tomorrow's game is uncertain.</p>
        <p>''You didn't know how bad it was,'' Sprewell said. ''You just had to keep going, keep fighting.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks were without their best two rebounders, but were beaten on the boards by a slim margin, 33-28. They were without two players who could have matched Smits's presence but pieced together a second-half strategy that worked. After Smits scored 21 points over the starter Chris Dudley and Kurt Thomas to give Indiana a 42-41 lead at the half, he scored only 4 more points.</p>
        <p>''I did a terrible job in the first half,'' Thomas said. ''I just had to regroup. I had to stay in front of him and deny him the ball.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks' renewed aggression began to pay off in the third quarter as the Pacers unraveled. After Dale Davis blocked a floater by Houston, the ball went to Sprewell, who popped up to shoot as the shot-clock buzzer went off. Miller was called for a foul on the attempt and was incensed. Instead of Indiana with the ball, down by 53-52, Sprewell was going to the free-throw line. A minute later, still seething, Miller barked at the referee Bob Delaney and drew a technical foul.</p>
        <p>''Tell you the truth, I think the tide turned on that call on Spree with the shot clock running out,'' said Miller, who scored an unspectacular 19 points. ''I thought we had gained control of the game right there. But they go up by 3 points, and that was it, the tide turned.''</p>
        <p>The Pacers could not regain their poise. With Ward slapping at the ball in Mark Jackson's hands, with Larry Johnson tackling every loose ball, the Knicks forced the Pacers into four turnovers in the last 2 minutes 27 seconds of the third quarter. They parlayed the Pacers' mistakes into a 71-64 lead entering the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Lately, this is where Sprewell has come apart. Over his previous 10 fourth quarters, Sprewell had hit just 4 of 31 attempts. As if to defy the numbers, Sprewell made his first three shots in the opening four minutes of the fourth quarter to give the Knicks a 77-68 lead.</p>
        <p>''I have been struggling,'' Sprewell said. ''I came in knowing I haven't been playing well. I just had to attack. My teammates were behind me. Today, I was on.''</p>
        <p>Jalen Rose was invisible through three quarters, with just 4 points. Jackson (1 for 6) and Austin Croshere (3 points) were also hidden in the game.</p>
        <p>''It's very disappointing,'' Pacers Coach Larry Bird said. ''We had an opportunity. We had many guys fleeing out there. They didn't do anything to help.''</p>
        <p>Rose was too late. The Knicks' lead grew to 13 points with 6:36 remaining before Rose got going. He scored a wild 22 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter and put a mild scare into the Knicks. With Miller on the bench in a game that seemed lost, the Pacers cut their deficit to 3 points after some careless possessions and two missed free throws by Houston.</p>
        <p>Handling prosperity is not the Knicks' best quality. They are better when they have to defy logic, gravity and dire circumstances all at once. In one snapshot, the 6-2 Ward accomplished all three with his block on Smits in the third quarter.</p>
        <p>''It was kind of funny,'' said Ward, who slipped into Camby's role as the X-factor with 14 points, 3 steals and 9 assists. ''It felt crazy. But an angel was telling me to fly, fly high. He was 7-foot-4, and the only way to get there was to fly.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>Considering how upset the Knicks were upon hearing of MALIK SEALY's death a day before Game 7 in Miami last Sunday, it seemed odd that none of the players attended the funeral of the Timberwolves guard at Riverside Church on Friday. Five Pacers, three of whom knew Sealy from their St. John's roots, were at the service. ''I don't know if any of our guys knew him well,'' JEFF VAN GUNDY said. ''They could have gone and been back before practice.'' On Friday, practice was scheduled for 2 p.m. The funeral began at 10 a.m. and ended at 1 p.m. The Pacers didn't practice until 4:30 p.m. ''I wanted to go,'' said LATRELL SPREWELL, who knew Sealy well. ''But with my family coming in and with practice, I couldn't.''</p>
