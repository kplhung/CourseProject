        <p>By now, most of Eddie Slack's customers are accustomed to paying $30 or more to fill their gas tanks. ''The big sticker shock was several months ago,'' said Mr. Slack, owner of the Delwood Chevron service station in Austin, Tex.</p>
        <p>After falling a good bit following a decision by the petroleum-exporting countries in March to increase oil production, gasoline prices have soared to the highest levels of the year in many parts of the nation.</p>
        <p>Drivers now filling up are paying record prices for the Memorial Day weekend. And analysts say tight supplies, particularly in the Midwest, could push prices higher as demand increases with the beginning of the summer driving season and as parts of the country struggle to meet a June 1 deadline for using a cleaner-burning reformulated fuel as required by the federal government.</p>
        <p>The average national price for regular unleaded is $1.53 a gallon, the same level reached in March and almost 40 cents higher than last year, federal officials said. In New York City, drivers are paying $1.64 a gallon, compared with $1.27 last year, according to AAA, the automobile association.</p>
        <p>Adjusted for inflation, of course, gasoline is still cheap, even with the sharp rise of the last year. The 30 cents a gallon that Americans paid in the early 1960's translates to about $1.75 today, according to Cambridge Energy Research Associates. And the $1.25 a gallon that drivers paid in the early 1980's is equivalent to $2.50 today.</p>
        <p>In April, prices around the country fell almost a dime a gallon, on average, after OPEC ministers voted in late March to increase production. But the decline turned out to be short-lived, as drivers everywhere learned this week when they gassed up for the holiday weekend.</p>
        <p>''It costs so much that I don't even fill up the tank anymore,'' Tadd Balfour, a 25-year-old computer network engineer, said as he added $10 worth of gas to the 20-gallon tank of his Montero sport utility vehicle at Mr. Slack's station on Friday. Mr. Balfour, who commutes more than 20 miles each day, says he has considered buying a smaller car. ''If gas goes up another couple of points, I may have to make a change,'' he said. ''But I'm closely watching what prices do. Right now, it's out of control.''.</p>
        <p>Mr. Balfour and other customers at Mr. Slack's small but busy service station on Interstate 35 near downtown Austin paid $1.41 a gallon for regular gasoline this week, $1.52 for midgrade and $1.61 for premium. That is less than in most other parts of the country, but that did not stop customers from complaining about recent increases. ''They were really hollering,'' Mr. Slack said.</p>
        <p>Despite the high prices, holiday driving is expected to eclipse last year's rates. AAA said it expected more than 34 million Americans to travel at least 100 miles from their homes over the weekend, 3 percent more than last year and 31 percent more than during the 1991 Memorial Day weekend.</p>
        <p>Much of the blame for the recent price increase lies with the low inventories of gasoline around the country, a factor that played a big role in high prices earlier this year. But the latest run-up has been accelerated by the scramble to introduce a new reformulated fuel in most large metropolitan areas. Prices have also moved higher because of worries that a legal dispute involving the Unocal Corporation's patents for certain reformulated gas is holding back production at some refineries.</p>
        <p>The cleaner-burning fuel is being sold in the Boston-to-Washington corridor, including much of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, as well as in much of California and in Chicago, Milwaukee, Houston and Dallas. Worries over tight supplies of the fuel have been particularly acute in the Midwest, where prices are soaring. In Chicago, for example, drivers are paying an average of $1.85 for regular unleaded, up 30 cents in the last month and more than 60 cents over last year, according to AAA. Some of the city's service stations have already raised prices above $2.00 a gallon. Milwaukee drivers are paying $1.74 a gallon.</p>
        <p>State lawmakers in Wisconsin have authorized the filing of a lawsuit to block adoption of the new fuel rules there. And in St. Louis, officials won a waiver from the Environmental Protection Agency allowing use of the old gas until June 5.</p>
        <p>Late Friday, the E.P.A. denied requests from both Chicago and Milwaukee for waivers there. The agency said there was enough of the reformulated fuel to make waivers unnecessary.</p>
        <p>The reformulated fuel is harder to blend, and Midwest refiners are unlikely to be able to increase production soon, said Philip K. Verleger, a senior adviser to the Brattle Group, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass. Absent an E.P.A. waiver, gas prices in Chicago and Milwaukee could go much higher, even well above $2 a gallon, before the situation stabilizes, Mr. Verleger said. ''There's no real way out of it for the next three or four weeks,'' he said.</p>
        <p>On top of pressure to meet the new fuel requirements, inventories are low even for regular gasoline, and that leaves the nation exposed to price spikes, said Daniel Yergin, president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. Stocks are so low, he said, that ''any change in supply will reverberate in the markets right away -- there isn't much of a normal cushion.''</p>
        <p>Concerns about a shortage of reformulated fuel helped push gasoline futures to $1.026 a gallon on Friday, their highest level since the Persian Gulf war, before settling back a few cents in the shortened preholiday trading session at the New York Mercantile Exchange. Oil futures closed at $30 a barrel, only a few dollars short of the high for the year and at the top end of a trading band in which OPEC ministers want crude to remain. Should oil prices stay at these levels, or rise, analysts say the cartel could act to increase production once more.</p>
        <p>Oil prices have more than doubled since early last year. OPEC decided in March 1999 to cut back production, and cartel members largely adhered to the new limits on output, which, combined with stronger demand from Asia, caused prices to soar.</p>
        <p>At Mr. Slack's service station, Edward Wyndham, a 64-year-old carpenter and part-time minister, remembers when gas stations gave away glassware to attract customers. Now he says he and his friends just seek the cheapest prices.</p>
        <p>''It's outrageous, what they've done,'' Mr. Wyndham said as he finished putting gas in his pickup truck. ''It's the poor people who are suffering. I'm mad about it.''</p>
