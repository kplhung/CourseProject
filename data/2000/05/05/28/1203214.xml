        <p>O.K., so Brooklyn is not exactly the land of milk and honey. But there is plenty of other yummy stuff on the menu, so much that it is getting hard to keep track of it all. But don't despair. There is a Web site dedicated solely to monitoring, rating and sometimes ranting about the mushrooming restaurant scene in Brooklyn, U.S.A.</p>
        <p>''The scene just exploded,'' said Lenny Karle-Zenith, who, with his wife Anne, founded the Web site, Taste of Brooklyn%%cq%%, last year. ''Nobody really expected it.'' Why such gastronomic growth? ''Like everything else in Manhattan, rents were out of control,'' he said. ''It was much cheaper to open new places in Brooklyn.'' He added, ''Many people were getting tired of the Manhattan food grind. And some restaurateurs tired of it, too. They saw Brooklyn as a prime market, especially the area around Smith Street, with all the young professionals moving into Carroll Gardens.''</p>
        <p>The Karle-Zeniths moved to Carroll Gardens five years ago, ''when there was nothing but a pizza joint,'' Mr. Karle-Zenith said. ''But we're real foodies, so we began searching out little places in Brooklyn.'' The couple first encountered Patois, a top-rated bistro in Carroll Gardens. They soon found more culinary gems amid the boroughs' brownstones, and when more restaurants like Victory Kitchen began opening, ''we decided it was time to create a directory and put it online,'' Mr. Karle-Zenith said.</p>
        <p>WHAT YOU SEE -- The site is well organized and easy to navigate. But Brooklyn is a very big place. So far, the site covers only epicurean hot spots in Brownstone Brooklyn -- Carroll Gardens, Boerum Hill, Park Slope, Brooklyn Heights, Cobble Hill and Fort Greene. Bay Ridge, Williamsburg and other neighborhoods will be added soon.</p>
        <p>Sections include ''Find A Restaurant,'' which allows searching by neighborhood, cuisine or price; ''Main Ingredient,'' describing one dish that is fairly Brooklynesque (this month, pasta) and providing local recipes; ''Taster's Choice,'' with reviews written by neighbors called ''taste buds,'' and ''What's Cooking,'' almost daily updates on Brooklyn openings, closings, promotions, wine tastings and more.</p>
        <p>There is also a regular feature article (for example, an in-depth look at rice balls), a ''Tastemaker'' interview with a local chef or owner, a ''Wine Lady'' column and one called ''Percy Speaks,'' a highly opinionated review of life, politics and eating out in Brooklyn, written by the Karle-Zeniths' downstairs neighbor.</p>
        <p>LINKS -- To several sites covering local food, art, culture and economic development.</p>
        <p>WHAT YOU GET -- A cross-referenced, constantly updated culinary excursion through the place that Ed Norton, of ''Honeymooners'' fame, once called ''the garden spot of the world.''</p>
