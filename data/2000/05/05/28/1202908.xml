        <p>MARY ELLEN GRILLS arrived home from a Florida vacation in March to find a note from a neighbor stuck to her door.</p>
        <p>It said that a fire earlier in the day had destroyed the downtown block in Mystic that housed the store that Ms. Grills owned, Pepper Grass and Tulip. She drove to her store that night and found it boarded up. Many of the gifts, clothes and antiques she sold were ruined. ''It was devastating,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In the early morning of March 6, a fire started by what the town fire marshal called an improperly installed furnace ripped through the 160-year-old Central Hall block on West Main Street, destroying the building and eight businesses. Helped by an unusually calm night, firefighters were able to prevent the blaze from spreading to neighboring shops, some of which are just a few feet away.</p>
        <p>''I think I was a little bit relieved that it wasn't any more extensive than it was. The stop by the fire department was amazing,'' said James O'Boyle, a funeral home owner and president of the Mystic Chamber of Commerce.</p>
        <p>Mystic is one of the top tourist destinations in the state and there was concern in the village that the fire would drive away business during the busy summer season, when the shops earn most of their revenues.</p>
        <p>The village has also had to battle with the impression that the whole downtown had burned, not just one building that housed eight businesses: Uniquities; N. L. Shaw &amp; Company; Radio Waves; Trade Winds Gallery; Pepper Grass and Tulip; Mixed Bag; Stonewear Clothing; and Dexter &amp; Company. Pentangle Fashion Boutique, in a building next door, closed for a few weeks because of smoke damage but reopened earlier this month.</p>
        <p>''We've been trying to dispel the myth that the whole downtown was destroyed, that it was only eight stores out of 100,'' Linnea Lindstrom, the executive director of the chamber, said. Thomas Aalund, the owner of Trade Winds Gallery, one of the destroyed businesses, said he lost hundreds of historic marine charts, maps and paintings in the fire.</p>
        <p>''While it's been hard for the people it hit, Mystic is still Mystic, the downtown is still the downtown and it will be summer here like always,'' he said.</p>
        <p>With the building destroyed, five of the eight shop owners have scrambled to find new locations in the downtown. Three, including Grills, should be open by today. Mr. Aalund said he planned to reopen a few weeks later. Uniquities and Mixed Bag are not relocating downtown; the owner of Dexter &amp; Company, a jewelry story, is working out of his home, and Stonewear Clothing is still looking for a site, Ms. Lindstrom said.</p>
        <p>Many of them hope to some day return to their former storefronts, which are prized downtown locations because so many tourists pass the building.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to go back. People expect to find me there,'' Mr. Aalund said.</p>
        <p>That will not happen until at least next year. Two building owners, Rufus Allyn and Roy Bohlander of Mystic, had no fire insurance for the one-story building. They have hired Mercer &amp; Bertsche, a local architectural and engineering firm, to develop plans to rebuild the block.</p>
        <p>Mr. Allyn and Mr. Bohlander are considering plans for a one-story building or for a three-story structure that would have shops on the ground floor and apartments on the upper two floors. The owners have declined to discuss their plans until they are more specific.</p>
        <p>Any project would need local, state and federal permits because the existing building sits on pilings over the Mystic River. Many residents and downtown merchants favor the three-story proposal because it would mesh with the other historic buildings on the street and resemble what existed at the site at the turn of the last century. Others are excited about creating more housing opportunities in the downtown.</p>
        <p>''It was a devastating tragedy for Mystic, but now I'm looking forward to the future,'' Ms. Lindstrom said. ''We'll have a beautiful, modern building that will fit in with the historic character of the downtown.''</p>
        <p>Although the fire was a blow to the downtown, it also brought the community together.</p>
        <p>Even while firefighters fought the blaze, shopkeepers brought coffee and donuts to them while others let the eight merchants store salvaged items in their shops as they were pulled from the fire.</p>
        <p>A group of people helped Mr. Aalund rescue hundreds of historic maps and charts from his building and store them in the vacant building that once housed the Seaport Pharmacy. Some of his nautical charts were valued at more than $3,000 each.</p>
        <p>''Before I knew it, there were two pickups in front of my store with 8 to 10 people moving out items. All I kept saying was, 'This goes,' 'This is a maybe,' 'This can't be saved.' Within a couple of hours most items in the front room of my store were salvaged and were already in Seaport Pharmacy,'' Mr. Aalund said.</p>
        <p>''The community and the chamber were unbelievable,'' he said. ''That's the difference between being in a city and being in a place like Mystic.''</p>
        <p>After the fire the chamber raised more than $30,000 to help the businesses until they could reopen. The chamber began distributing the money last month. The businesses are also eligible for low-interest federal disaster loans.</p>
        <p>''One doesn't expect this type of response,'' Mr. Aalund said. ''Under the circumstances it definitely eased the impact. It was very, very gratifying.''</p>
        <p>Some merchants like Mr. Aalund discovered they did not have enough insurance to pay for the merchandise they lost. Others, like Ms. Grills, had to lay off five employees until she reopens. Luckily, she said, some of them already had part-time jobs.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Boyle said the one bright spot about the fire was that it forced other merchants to re-examine their insurance coverage to make sure they have enough.</p>
        <p>Ms. Grills, who has been in three downtown locations over the past 15 years, is renovating the Seaport Pharmacy building for her shop and hopes to be open for Memorial Day. She had been talking to the building owner about relocating there even before the fire.</p>
        <p>While the three-month closure has been difficult for Ms. Grills, and her employees, she said she is looking forward to moving boxes into her new shop and seeing her former home rebuilt.</p>
        <p>''I just like to think positively and it will be O.K.,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aalund, a native of Estonia who has run his shop in several downtown locations for the past 26 years, has been working almost daily since the fire, restoring damaged items in a Westerly, R.I., warehouse. He hopes to reopen July 1 in a former photo shop building on Cotrell Street.</p>
        <p>That would only be temporary because its owners plan to tear it down to make room for a small hotel.</p>
        <p>''This would have been much worse of a catastrophe if this had happened in July or August. If the building is available, I'll be able to salvage most of the summer. Life goes on,'' Mr. Aalund said.</p>
        <p>His optimism was also seen just a few hours after the fire, when he posted a handwritten note on one of the storefront windows.</p>
        <p>''Somewhere, somehow, we shall be back even if not now,'' it read.</p>
