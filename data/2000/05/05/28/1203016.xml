        <p>Good Will is good enough for Tara Subkoff and Matt Damhave, two 20-something art school dropouts who recently started Imitation of Christ, a Los Angeles-based line of thrift store couture. ''The idea is to take refuse -- or ''undesirables'' -- and make them desirable again,'' Mr. Damhave said. To that end, a polka-dot polyester dress (''Old Man's Fantasy'') has had its hem hiked and sleeves puffed ($888), and red-and-white-striped bathing trunks ($333) had the liner torn out and ''Sincerity is the new vulgarity'' scrawled on a pocket.</p>
        <p>The label, available in New York at Zao, held its spring/summer 2001 debut last Saturday in Los Angeles at an active subway stop, where a 150-foot escalator doubled as catwalk.</p>

        <p>Good Will is good enough for Tara Subkoff and Matt Damhave, two 20-something art school dropouts who recently started Imitation of Christ, a Los Angeles-based line of thrift store couture.

        <p>The label, available in New York at Zao, held its spring/summer 2001 debut last Saturday in Los Angeles at an active subway stop, where a 150-foot escalator doubled as catwalk.</p>
        <p>While Imitation of Christ could be considered an imitation of the fashion recycler Miguel Adrover, the design team maintains that its creative approach is closer to early Vivienne Westwood. Mr. Damhave cited one of his collection's more extreme custom T-shirts, a souvenir inscribed with ''Munchen, Bavaria.'' ''I put it on and spilled a glass of red wine down the front,'' Mr. Damhave said. ''That was all the alteration it required.''</p>
