        <p>THE wood-shingled cottage, tucked behind businesses across the road from a major suburban mall, had been deteriorating for years.

        <p>THE wood-shingled cottage, tucked behind businesses across the road from a major suburban mall, had been deteriorating for years. The roof leaked, the interior walls bowed and the paint was peeling. The house where Walt Whitman was born and spent the first four years of his life had not been spruced up since 1957.</p>
        <p>It wasn't until last spring, when an Argentine tourist visited the Walt Whitman Birthplace State Historic Site that the situation reached a head, said Barbara Mazor Bart, executive director of the site. ''The man was standing in front of the building and having one of our guides take picture after picture of him,'' Ms. Bart said. ''He'd traveled all this way to see the birthplace of someone he obviously revered and it was so shabby. It was embarrassing.''</p>
        <p>Now the birthplace has undergone a complete restoration, accomplished with $250,000 from the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, which oversees Long Island's only state historical site.</p>
        <p>With about $25,000 worth of furnishings provided by the association, the restored farmhouse will reopen next Sunday as part of festivities marking the poet's 181st birthday and the 50th anniversary of the Walt Whitman Birthplace Association. Rescuing the house from oblivion and the builder's wrecking ball, the non-profit group acquired the house and the acre it stands on in 1951 for $20,000, and turned it into a museum and literary center.</p>
        <p>The weekend's program includes a master class at 1 p.m. on Saturday  by Marge Piercy, poet-in-residence.</p>
        <p>In restoring the birthplace, state and site officials faced two challenges. The house should contain items owned by the Whitman family and be true to the architecture of the period.</p>
        <p>The home includes a desk that Whitman used,'' said Ms. Bart. ''There are people who hold him in such esteem that I've seen them come and put their hands on his desk as if they were trying to pick up vibes from him.''</p>
        <p>But most of the furnishings are simply from the period.</p>
        <p>The simple farmhouse, circa 1820, was built by hand by the poet's father, Walter Whitman. Made of hand-hewn beams held together by wooden pegs and laid on whole tree trunks supported by a foundation of small boulders, it is considered a fine example of local construction. But it is also innovative, with a corbeled chimney and storage closets in the fireplace walls.</p>
        <p>Part of the interior restoration involved removing a bathtub and toilet to return the second floor to its original condition with three bedrooms and access to attics.</p>
        <p>Reclaiming these bedrooms, said Richard Ryan, the site's curator, helped him solve a longstanding mystery. ''Over the years,'' Mr. Ryan said, ''I had picked up bits and pieces of information about the Whitmans, including the 1820 census which revealed that 10 people -- not just Walt, his mother and father and his brother, Jessie -- lived in the house. It doesn't say who, just gives ages.</p>
        <p>''The restoration made it easier to figure out just who. There were probably two grandmothers; the top riser on the staircase is only an inch above the first step making it seem like elderly people with poor eyesight used the staircase. From deeds and family papers, I can guess that the others were probably Walter Whitman's married brother, his wife and daughter, and another single brother. I now have a profile of the family and it was an extended family in every sense of the word.''</p>
        <p>The Walt Whitman Birthday Celebration is at noon next Sunday at the Birthplace on Old Walt Whitman Road in Huntington Station. Information: (631) 427-5240.</p>
