        <p>Gil de Ferran of Brazil won the Bosch Spark Plug Grand Prix today at the Nazareth Speedway, ending a three-year drought for Roger Penske and giving his team its 100th victory.</p>
        <p>''I can't tell you how happy I am getting that one off our back,'' Penske said. ''I think we're back.''</p>
        <p>In the makeup of a CART race postponed on April 9 because of  snow, de Ferran drove his Honda Reynard .815 seconds ahead of  Mauricio Gugelmin in a Mercedes Reynard. In third was Kenny Brack, winner of the 1999 Indianapolis 500.</p>
        <p>Juan Montoya, the 1999 CART champion and the defending champion here, finished fourth in a Toyota-powered Lola.</p>
        <p>Montoya and his teammate, Jimmy Vasser, who finished seventh today, will race in the Indy 500 on Sunday.</p>
        <p>The Penske team will not be competing at Indy this year because of the split of CART and the Indy Racing League series.</p>
        <p>De Ferran took the lead with 68 laps to go in the 225-mile race and was only seriously challenged on the final restart with four laps left.</p>
        <p>Penske is the owner with the most victories in Indy-car racing. Al Unser Jr.'s victory in Indianapolis in 1994 marked the zenith of the team. But the team's last victory came 54 races ago, when Paul Tracy won the Motorola 300 in 1997.</p>
