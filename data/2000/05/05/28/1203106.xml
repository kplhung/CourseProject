        <p>Visitors to online auction sites know that people try to sell the darnedest things. But a team of emerging-markets bond specialists based in North Korea?</p>
        <p>Thomas Cooper, who manages an emerging-markets bond fund at Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo &amp; Company in Boston, says he got the point right away when he saw the posting on eBay last week: People who sell, trade and analyze debt issued in emerging markets are going begging as some firms exit that business.

        <p>Visitors to online auction sites know that people try to sell the darnedest things. But a team of emerging-markets bond specialists based in North Korea?</p>
        <p>Thomas Cooper, who manages an emerging-markets bond fund at Grantham, Mayo, Van Otterloo &amp; Company in Boston, says he got the point right away when he saw the posting on eBay last week: People who sell, trade and analyze debt issued in emerging markets are going begging as some firms exit that business. Still, he could not resist the temptation and placed a bid of $10 million.</p>
        <p>His bid was the only one before eBay shut down the auction and wiped it off the site. A spokesman for eBay -- which is still smarting from the recently canceled auction, for $135,805, of a painting that resembled a Diebenkorn --  said eBay allowed sales of professional services but not the professionals themselves.</p>
        <p>When a person identifying himself as the seller contacted Mr. Cooper about paying up, he  calmly declined.</p>
