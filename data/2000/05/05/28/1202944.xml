        <p>Erode, Don't Implode</p>
        <p>Q. As I watch the Coliseum being dismantled floor by floor, I can't help wondering why they don't just dynamite it. Does the city prohibit demolition by implosion, or is there something about the building that prevents this?</p>
        <p>A. Implosion involves the precise weakening of a building's support columns with small, carefully timed charges, causing the building to collapse under its own weight in seconds. Though implosion can be practiced with delicacy and exactitude, the New York City building code has forbidden it for many years, according to Paul Wein, a spokesman for the Department of Buildings.</p>

        <p>Erode, Don't Implode</p>
        <p>Q. As I watch the Coliseum being dismantled floor by floor, I can't help wondering why they don't just dynamite it. Does the city prohibit demolition by implosion, or is there something about the building that prevents this?</p>
        <p>A. Implosion involves the precise weakening of a building's support columns with small, carefully timed charges, causing the building to collapse under its own weight in seconds. Though implosion can be practiced with delicacy and exactitude, the New York City building code has forbidden it for many years, according to Paul Wein, a spokesman for the Department of Buildings.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, it is the city's creaky infrastructure -- its subterranean water mains, gas and steam lines, and telephone and electrical cables -- and the density of its buildings and streets that render the use of explosives impractical, if not ruinous, Mr. Wein said. The use of wrecking balls is forbidden for the same reasons, making New York City demolition a generally slow, costly, painstaking and union-friendly activity, like construction in reverse.</p>
        <p>Buildings belonging to state or federal agencies are exempt from the code, Mr. Wein said, so the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, the Port Authority and the Postal Service are free to blow their buildings to smithereens if they choose. Strangely, though it can't be used in demolition, dynamite is permitted in excavations for new buildings, where it is frequently used to blast through solid rock or old concrete.</p>
        <p>Still in the Beast's Belly</p>
        <p>Q. Jack Henry Abbott, the jailhouse author of ''In The Belly of the Beast,'' was sentenced to a minimum of 15 years after killing a young actor in 1981. Was he paroled?</p>
        <p>A. Before Jack Henry Abbott began serving his term of 15 years to life for first-degree manslaughter in New York, he was sent to federal prison in Marion, Ill., to complete a sentence for a 1971 bank robbery that had been cut short by parole.  Upon his release in 1986, he was transported to Auburn State Prison, where he began serving his New York sentence as Prisoner 86A-6005. Mr. Abbott was transferred to the Attica Correctional Facility in 1993.</p>
        <p>Mr. Abbott had spent 21 of his 33 years behind bars when he began corresponding with Norman Mailer in 1977, and he was among the literary figures that sponsored his release from a Utah prison in June  1981. He was working as researcher for Mr. Mailer and living in a halfway house on the Bowery when ''In the Belly of the Beast,'' a harrowing collection of his prison writings, was published to critical acclaim.</p>
        <p>Weeks later, while eating with friends at the BiniBon, an all-night diner at 79 Second Avenue, Mr. Abbott became confused when Richard Adan, a part-time waiter, refused to let him use the bathroom. Within moments Mr. Abbott lured Mr. Adan outside, stabbed him to death and fled. At a Manhattan civil trial in 1990, the jury awarded Ricci Adan, Mr. Adan's widow, $7.57 million in damages, so Mr. Abbott will not receive a penny for the sales of ''In the Belly of the Beast'' or any other writings. At the trial, where he acted as his own lawyer, he told Mrs. Adan her husband's life was ''not worth a dime.'' Now 56, Mr. Abbott will become eligible for parole in June 2001.</p>
        <p>What's in a Name?</p>
        <p>Q. Many streets in Williamsburg are named for signers of the Declaration of Independence, but what about the mysterious Keap Street?</p>
        <p>A. According to the Brooklyn borough historian, John Manbeck, the signature of Thomas McKean, a signer of the Declaration from Delaware, was incorrectly read as Thomas M. Keap when the streets were named, probably in the 1850's.</p>
