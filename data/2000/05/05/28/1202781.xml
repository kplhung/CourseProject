        <p>Mormon pioneers came to this once desolate, high-desert valley to get away from the rest of the world. But 153 years later, the roughly one million people living at the base of the Wasatch Mountains are preparing to welcome the world for the 2002 Winter Olympics.</p>
        <p>In Salt Lake City, work crews are erecting two hotels and expanding the Salt Palace Convention Center.  Interstate 15, widened to 12 lanes,  will stretch the length of the valley, joining a new light-rail train to help handle the expected crowds of athletes, spectators and workers.</p>
        <p>Athletes are already training at the Utah Olympic Park, about 30 miles east of the city. Visitors can tour the park ($5 a car) and even try out some of the courses.</p>
        <p>But sports aren't the only attractions this summer: the city is host to an international music competition and the Utah Arts Festival.</p>
        <p>Events</p>
        <p>At Olympic Park in Park City, every Saturday beginning July 1 spectators will be able to watch members of the American and other free-style ski teams slide down an artificial surface to a ramp that sends aerialists twisting and flipping in the air before splashing into a 750,000-gallon pool.</p>
        <p>And you can try it yourself: for $125, intermediate skiers 15 years and older can be coached for a day in free-style aerial skiing on July 8, 15 and 22 and Aug. 5 and 19.</p>
        <p>Even nonskiers can get a taste of the sport daily from July 1 to Sept. 1 by strapping into a harness attached to thick bungee chords while an instructor helps with back flips and other maneuvers. The cost is $5 for up to five minutes.</p>
        <p>For the less adventurous, tours of the bobsled run and ski jumps are given daily 11 a.m., and 12:30 and 2 p.m. The 60- to-90-minute tours cost $6, $4 for seniors and children 5 to 11.  For park information, call (435) 658-4200.</p>
        <p>A different kind of challenge is the Gina Bachauer International Junior Piano Competition and International Piano Festival. The competition --  among 27 contestants ages 11 to 13 from nine countries -- takes place June 13 to 17 in Assembly Hall on Temple Square downtown, and is free. The top six contestants play a concert June 24 at 7:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>The festival, honoring the 250th anniversary of the death of Johann Sebastian Bach, includes guest artists performing recitals, lecturing and teaching master classes, in which a pianist is given a lesson  before an audience. Tickets to the master classes, June 19 to 23, cost $20 a day or $75 for five days from (888) 521-9200. The free recitals, June 1 to 28, feature the complete keyboard works of Bach.</p>
        <p>The Utah Arts Festival takes place noon to 10 p.m. June 22 to 25 at the Utah State Fairpark, 155 North 1000  West. Jazz, folk, pop and classical music, modern dance and poetry readings will take place on five stages. Food from around the world will be available, 125 artists will sell their works and there will be hands-on art projects. Admission is $5, $2 for age 60 and older and for everyone on Thursday and Friday from noon to 3 p.m.; children under 12 are admitted free.</p>
        <p>Fourth of July celebrations will take place at Sugarhouse Park, 1500 East 2100 South, and Rice-Eccles Stadium, at the University of Utah. Beginning at 1 p.m. in the park, there will be food, an arts festival, activities for children, and in the evening, a performance by the Utah Symphony and fireworks. The celebration is free but parking is limited; (801) 535-6323.</p>
        <p>At the stadium, the Red Hot 4th Stadium Extravaganza will feature music by the bands Chicago and They Might Be Giants. Tickets are $12, $18 and $24 from the Huntsman Center, (801) 581-6641, or Smith's Tix, (800) 888-8499.</p>
        <p>From July 17 to 24, world champion cowboys converge on Salt Lake City for the Days of '47 Rodeo in the Delta Center, 301 West South Temple. Competition is nightly at 7:30. Tickets cost $10.50 to $29.50 from Ticketmaster, (801) 325-7328. Information: (801) 325-2000.</p>
        <p>The city will nearly shut down on July 24 for the 153rd anniversary of the Mormon pioneers' arrival to the valley. Salt Lake residents hold services, parades, road races, festivals and fireworks. The Days of '47 Parade begins at 9 a.m. along 200 East and ends up at Liberty Park, 600 East 1300 South, where a Neighborhood Fair and Native American celebration and fireworks will take place.</p>
        <p>Sightseeing</p>
        <p>Visitors and lifelong residents alike marvel at the majestic mountains that ring the Salt Lake Valley, which offer hiking for all levels. For an easy walk, head to City Creek Canyon just north of downtown. From Second Avenue and Canyon Road, walk north through a residential area and Memory Grove Park, then follow the road to a gatehouse, where a five-mile paved road begins. Walkers and cyclists have it to themselves on odd-numbered dates, and walkers share the road with cars ($2.50 a vehicle) on other days. The canyon is open 8:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. Call (801) 483-6880 to reserve picnic sites, which cost $2.50 to $30.</p>
        <p>More demanding trails and climbing can be found in Millcreek Canyon, east of the city -- (801) 483-5473 for information -- and Big Cottonwood and Little Cottonwood Canyons, to the southeast, (801) 466-6411.</p>
        <p>They say the sunsets are beautiful from Buffalo Point on Antelope Island. But the best time to visit the largest island in the Great Salt Lake may be in the morning, when the pesky gnats and mosquitoes are not swarming. Antelope Island State Park, 30 miles northwest of Salt Lake City off I-15, is home to a 500 buffaloes that roam freely, along with mule deer, big horn sheep, antelope and coyotes. More than 30 miles of hiking trails reach vantage points that offer spectacular views of the lake. Take your own water. The island's beach at Bridger Bay is the best place to experience the sensation of floating on the salt water.</p>
        <p>Park fees are $7 a vehicle or $4 per cyclist or pedestrian. The 30 camp sites cost $10 a night. Information: (801) 773-2941; camp site reservations: (800) 322-3770.</p>
        <p>At Temple Square, visitors can learn about Mormonism, get a close-up view of the six-spired Salt Lake Temple and walk inside the domed Tabernacle. But another popular place is across the street in the church's Family History Library, 35 North West Temple, (801) 240-2331. The library has the largest archive of its kind in the world and is a gold mine for genealogists of any faith or belief.</p>
        <p>For newcomers to the searching out of one's roots, the library has computer terminals with easy-to-use software. Terminals are also at the Family Search Center in the Joseph Smith Memorial Building, 15 East South Temple. Use of the library and center is free. The library is open Tuesday through Saturday, 7:30 a.m. to 10 p.m. and Monday 7:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. Center hours are 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., Monday through Saturday.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>Hotel Monaco, 15 West 200 South,  with 1930's French decor, is a lively addition to the downtown hotel scene. The daily manager's social at 5 p.m. offers guests a free neck and shoulder massage with a glass of wine. The hotel is a refurbished 15-story bank building with 225 rooms, a restaurant and a bar. The 10-foot ceilings and extra-long beds make it a favorite for visiting professional basketball teams. A double room is $149; (801) 595-0000, fax (801) 532-8500.</p>
        <p>For a more conservative setting there is The Inn at Temple Square, 71 West South Temple. The 90 rooms, most of which have views of either the Mormon Temple or Abravanel Hall, the city's premier concert hall,  have the look and feel of a country inn. The inn and its restaurant do not serve alcohol. A double with a king-size four-poster bed is $130 on weekdays and $99 on weekends. Rates include a hot breakfast; (800) 843-4668, fax (801) 536-7272.</p>
        <p>Little America Hotel and Towers, 500 South Main Street, offers a broad selection of accommodations -- from the Governor's suite for $800 a night to motel-style rooms for $59 on weekends. There are 850 rooms in the tower and other buildings, two restaurants, two swimming pools, a fitness room, a hair salon and four gift shops. A double in the spacious tower suites is $164, while smaller garden rooms go for $129. Rates drop about $35 or more on weekends; (800) 453-9450, fax (801) 596-5911.</p>
        <p>Budget: Downtown Hampton Inn, 425 South 300 West, is close to some of the city's best restaurants and microbreweries. The 158-room hotel has an indoor pool, hot tub and exercise room. A double is $79, with Continental breakfast; (801) 741-1110, fax (801) 741-1171.</p>
        <p>Luxury: Wolfe Krest Bed and Breakfast, 273 North East Capitol Boulevard, is the newest and one of most luxurious B &amp; B's in the area. The three-level Georgian revival mansion was built in 1905 and has 13 rooms, one with wheelchair access, all with fireplaces. Rates are $150 to $300, with a hot breakfast either in your room or in the dining area; (800) 669-4525, fax (801) 531-0522.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>Under state liquor laws, the New Yorker Club, 60 West Market Street, (801) 363-0166, is considered a private club, but nonmembers can buy a two-week membership for $10, which is valid for six people. It offers  elegant rooms with Italian marble floors and soft lighting. Appetizers include ahi tuna roll with a rich wasabi butter sauce; a popular entree is roast rack of lamb with rosemary cream and fresh vegetables. Try the raspberry almond tart for dessert. A meal for two with wine is about $150. Like all but one of these restaurants,  it is closed Sunday.</p>
        <p>The owners of the Metropolitan, 173 West Broadway (at 300 South), (801) 364-3472, have transformed a former warehouse into a chic, pricey spot. The intriguing menu includes a pudding-like Maine lobster tapioca brulee, Asian pear salad, and seared yellowfin tuna in a citrus sauce. A dessert of fruit soup comes with a corkscrew of caramelized sugar. Dinner for two with wine, $160.</p>
        <p>The basement location in a dingy strip mall belies the excellent Tuscan food at Michelangelo Ristorante, 2156 South Highland Drive, (801) 466-0961. Ravioli stuffed with porcini mushrooms and Parmesan cheese is served in a rich sauce of truffle oil and butter. The tiramisu is excellent. Dinner for two with wine, $75.</p>
        <p>To get out of the punishing summer heat, head up Emigration Canyon to Ruth's Diner, 2100 Emigration Canyon Road, (801) 582-5807, for breakfast, lunch or dinner. You can sit in the original dining car or on the patio next to the creek and try anything from burgers and salads to spicy coconut curried shrimp. A favored dessert is Ruth's bananas -- a parfait of sliced bananas, vanilla ice cream and warm rum sauce. Dinner for two with wine, $50. No reservations, and the wait can be long for Sunday brunch.</p>
        <p>For a step back to the time of car hops, burgers and malts, head to Hires Big H, 425 South 700 East. The place is swarming with teenagers and families craving the Big H burger on a soft flour-dusted bun ($2.65), greasy fries ($1.65), and thick malts ($2.29). You can order from your car or eat inside.</p>
