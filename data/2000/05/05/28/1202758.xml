        <p>In Search Of England</p>
        <p>Journeys Into the English Past.</p>
        <p>By Michael Wood.</p>

        <p>''Myth plays just as important a part in the construction of identity as does historical fact -- indeed it is often difficult to tell them apart,'' Michael Wood writes in ''In Search of England,'' a collection of illuminating essays on the pastiche of myths and facts that has shaped England's national identity. With scholarly zeal, journalistic skepticism and narrative flair, Wood, a veritable archaeologist of myth, examines key iconic figures, places and texts that have come to represent the idea and ideals of the English. The greatest icon of them all may well be King Arthur, who has inspired thousands of texts throughout the centuries. When a stone with a sixth-century inscription was discovered in 1998 in Arthur's legendary birthplace, pundits proclaimed it as definitive proof of Arthur's existence.+Wood, an English writer and documentary filmmaker, argues that it is only proof of the power of myth -- none of the earliest sources he's examined confirm that there actually was a historical Arthur. When Wood said as much in a documentary he was soundly denounced. It was a fate shared by a group of French priests visiting Devon in 1113. When they expressed some doubt about Arthur after being shown the supposed Arthur seat and Arthur oven, they were pelted with vegetables. Equally long-lasting and popular is the legend of Robin Hood, which is based on historical fact -- the person of Robert Hood, who was transformed over time from a petty thief robbing only to fill his pockets in 1226 to a rebel outlaw with a cause. Most interesting, though, are the essays in which Wood journeys off the trampled paths, as he does in his essay on Bede, the priest and scholar who wrote the first and one of the greatest English histories in 731.+A history written, as the best are, ''with the heart and the spirit as well as the intellect,'' as is Wood's adroit journey through the thickets of early medieval history.</p>
