        <p>''Yesterday's thought was how did I get here, 31, 32, just this huge knot of unknowing and losing my hair,'' a telemarketer in one of Sam Lipsyte's stories laments before dialing to determine a stranger's satisfaction with a local salad bar. Lipsyte's first book, a collection of stories titled VENUS DRIVE (Open City, paper, $13), is made of such bleak portraits -- we meet the aching and nearly defeated, people who seek cold comfort in drug dens, peep shows and corporate cubicles. Lipsyte writes in a clipped manner that establishes distance from his fringe-dwelling characters, and he employs shots of dark humor to alleviate the loneliness that fills these pages. In ''Cremains,'' the protagonist moves into his dead mother's apartment and shoots up her leftover morphine while tending to the building's old women, offering to change their light bulbs. He even toys with the idea of mercy killings. ''The newspaper Hilda gets delivered would call me evil,'' he says. ''The one I buy on the corner would say it's more complicated than that.'' In the best story here, ''My Life, for Promotional Use Only,'' Lipsyte -- who writes about movies for the online magazine Feed -- creates a pitch-perfect parody of the new media world. It's a place where the narrator -- a former underground rock hero who thinks a skill-set is ''some kind of mail-order frying pan'' -- is a woeful anachronism among the ''human resumes'' who ''study esoteric forms of South American combat and go on all-deer diets.'' Not for the faint of heart (or soul), ''Venus Drive'' explores the complexity of despair with poignancy and sly wit.</p>
