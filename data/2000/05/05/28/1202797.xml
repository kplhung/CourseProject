        <p>The problem with Philip Weiss's marriage would seem to stem from his having married a woman who has not grown up -- a woman who claims she was ''recruited'' into marriage (not once, but twice!) and who says that ''mistresshood'' is a more desirable state than marriage (''Is This Marriage on the Rocks?''). Anyone who would strive to make a marriage work to vindicate herself, against the well-meaning criticisms of a scientist trying to help, is childishly defensive.</p>

        <p>The Love Lab got it wrong -- there are indeed problems in Weiss's marriage, but they have nothing to do with his listening skills.</p>
