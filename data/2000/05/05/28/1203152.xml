        <p>We have made dramatic progress in reducing the number of nuclear weapons. In the last decade, the United States and the countries of the former Soviet Union together have taken about eight to nine thousand strategic nuclear weapons out of commission.</p>

        <p>Following are excerpts from the prepared text of a speech about national security that Vice President Al Gore delivered yesterday at the United States Military Academy at West Point.</p>
        <p>We have made dramatic progress in reducing the number of nuclear weapons. In the last decade, the United States and the countries of the former Soviet Union together have taken about eight to nine thousand strategic nuclear weapons out of commission.</p>
        <p>We need to continue on a course of deeper reductions. But it is critical that we have the right approach in doing so.</p>
        <p>We are urging the Russians to tighten cooperation with us to protect nuclear weapons materials and stop the transfer of ballistic missile and nuclear weapons technologies to rogue states. It is these states that represent the emerging threat to our country.</p>
        <p>The administration has been working on the technology for a national missile defense system designed to protect all 50 states from a limited attack at the hands of a rogue state. We believe, however, that it is essential to do this in a way that does not destroy the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. The ABM Treaty is the cornerstone of strategic stability in our relationship with Russia.</p>
        <p>It prevents either the Russians or ourselves from deploying defenses powerful enough -- assuming anyone can solve the engineering problems -- to neutralize the deterrent of either side. The Russians have made clear that their response to a powerful U.S. defensive system would be to halt arms control and increase the numbers of their offensive nuclear weapons. Thus, the ABM Treaty is a prerequisite for the deeper reductions in nuclear arms that we are seeking in START III, which is under discussion with the Russians even as we speak.</p>
        <p>We and the Russians agreed in Helsinki in 1997 that Start III would involve reductions to totals in the range of 2,000 to 2,500 weapons. That is a cut of up to 1,000 weapons from Start II levels. Such reductions are possible only through careful negotiation. . . .</p>
        <p>An approach that combines serious unilateral reductions with an attempt to build a massive defensive system will create instability, and thus undermine our security. Nuclear unilateralism will hinder, rather than help, arms control.</p>
        <p>Strategic stability can never be a one-way street. It either exists for both the United States and Russia, or neither. Reductions alone do not guarantee stability. It is how reductions are made and how they interact with defensive systems that makes the difference. That is why arms control and strategic modernization have to be built upon planned and negotiated agreements.</p>
        <p>The national missile defense system that the president will review this summer is intended to meet threats from proliferant states like North Korea while preserving strategic stability. It can co-exist with the ABM Treaty, if that treaty is adjusted. It can be compatible with further arms reductions.</p>
