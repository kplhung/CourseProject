        <p>Scotty Schulhofer, who won last year's Belmont Stakes with Lemon Drop Kid, unexpectedly found a possible starter for this year's classic yesterday when Postponed won the Peter Pan over the favored Unshaded at Belmont Park.</p>
        <p>Winning the Peter Pan is no guarantee that a horse will be rested or talented enough to win the $1 million Belmont, the third race in the Triple Crown series, especially since Fusaichi Pegasus and Red Bullet may stage a return match from their Wood Memorial and Preakness duels in the June 10 event. But 7 of the 46 winners of the Peter Pan have come back to win the Belmont Stakes, and Lemon Drop Kid finished in third place in the Peter Pan last year and still came back to win the Belmont.</p>
        <p>''If everything is all right, we'll definitely consider the Belmont Stakes,'' Schulhofer said. ''He's bred to go long, and he showed it.''</p>
        <p>Postponed, a son of Summer Squall, is owned by Jeanne Vance, who also owns Lemon Drop Kid. Postponed had a bad winter in Florida, running sixth in the Rhythm and fifth in the Florida Derby. Then he came north and ran sixth behind Fusaichi Pegasus and Red Bullet in the Wood.</p>
        <p>But with Edgar Prado riding him expertly yesterday in the Peter Pan, he roared from ninth and last place to third in the homestretch, and hooked up in a four-horse race to the wire. In a mass finish, he found room on the rail and surged ahead to win by three-quarters of a length over Unshaded, who had three-quarters of a length on Globalize, with Tahkodha Hills one length farther back.</p>
        <p>''He shot through a small opening that was just large enough,'' said Prado, who was riding his 3,999th winner in a career that has thrived in New York. ''It was real tight for a moment. When he saw the horse on the outside, he got game and finished extremely well.''</p>
        <p>Carl Nafzger, the trainer of Unshaded, who won the Lexington Stakes five weeks ago, noted that Unshaded carried 123 pounds while Postponed was assigned 113. Unshaded was withdrawn from the Kentucky Derby when he was kicked by a stable pony after a workout. Nafzger has sounded doubtful about pushing his colt into the Belmont but said the decision would be made by the owner, James Tafel, a retired publisher of business books.</p>
        <p>''I thought he ran a terrific race,'' Nafzger said of Unshaded. ''We're going to evaluate him after this, and go from there. We could have been up close and pushed for the win, but it was more important to get a good race into him.''</p>
        <p>Postponed ran the mile and an eighth in 1:493/5 , paid $21.20 for a $2 bet to win and earned $120,000.</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>Red Bullet's trainer, JOE ORSENO, said ''we'll know sometime Sunday'' if his horse will be entered in the Belmont Stakes. But NEIL DRYSDALE, the trainer of Fusaichi Pegasus, flew into New York from California and said that ''it's still too early to say'' whether his horse would make the return match. Orseno said he would ''kick it around'' by telephone with FRANK and ANDY STRONACH, the owners of Red Bullet, who ran second to Fusaichi Pegasus in the Wood Memorial but outran him in the Preakness. ''Right now, the horse is doing great,'' Orseno said, ''but there are a lot of factors to consider.'' . . . More Than Ready will skip tomorrow's 107th running of the Metropolitan Mile. ''He's had a tough campaign,'' said his trainer, TODD PLETCHER, ''and we just felt it was better to give him a little time off.''</p>
