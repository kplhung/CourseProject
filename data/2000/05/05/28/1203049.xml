        <p>In the 12 years that Anne Compoccia has served as the chairwoman of Community Board 1, she has earned a reputation as a tenacious local advocate, successfully fighting for the installation of traffic lights throughout TriBeCa and the construction of Washington Market Park and Public School 234.

        <p>Now, Ms. Compoccia's tenure is ending. On May 9, she wrote a letter to the community board saying she would not seek a new term as chairwoman in the next election, on June 20. But she plans to stay as a board member.</p>

        <p>In the 12 years that Anne Compoccia has served as the chairwoman of Community Board 1, she has earned a reputation as a tenacious local advocate, successfully fighting for the installation of traffic lights throughout TriBeCa and the construction of Washington Market Park and Public School 234. But her unyielding brand of leadership has also ruffled the feathers of some, who complain that she has intimidated opponents and discouraged dissent.</p>
        <p>Now, Ms. Compoccia's tenure is ending. On May 9, she wrote a letter to the community board saying she would not seek a new term as chairwoman in the next election, on June 20. But she plans to stay as a board member.</p>
        <p>''Twelve years is a long time,'' she said in an interview, adding, ''I figured I'd give someone else an opportunity to see how aggravating it can be.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Compoccia has recently been the subject of reports about problems unconnected to the board. Earlier this month, The New York Post reported that the city's Department of Investigation was looking into assertions that the Little Italy Chamber of Commerce, which Ms. Compoccia also heads, had not made  timely payments to the city of fees it collected from Mulberry Street merchants for their summertime mall.</p>
        <p>Patrick Clarke, a spokesman for the Department of Investigation, said the agency's policy is neither to confirm nor deny any investigation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Compoccia had no comment about an investigation or the Post's report two days later that she had stepped down from her position as head of the Children of San Gennaro, which runs the annual festival.</p>
        <p>On the merchant payments, the Post had quoted her as saying there  was ''a lot of confusion, a lot of screw-ups,'' but no ''corruption'' and that the city had been paid.</p>
        <p>Two contenders have emerged for Ms. Compoccia's board post. On May 16, the board nominating committee announced that Linda Roche, the vice chairwoman and a member for eight years, and Madelyn Wils, a 12-year member, would run for chairwoman.</p>
        <p>A priority for Ms. Roche is reducing noise from trucks and other vehicles. She wants to restrict the hours they can travel on Canal Street. Ms. Wils wants to create more open spaces in the area, and an indoor recreation center in TriBeCa.</p>
        <p>Paul Goldstein, the district manager of Community Board 1 for 16 years, described Ms. Compoccia as a popular and colorful leader.</p>
        <p>''She ran lively meetings and she said outrageous things,'' he said. ''It's the end of an era, and she will certainly be missed.''</p>
        <p>But others think a new leader will energize the board. Councilwoman Kathryn Freed, who represents the area and was chairwoman of the board from 1984 to 1986, said, ''No one should serve for 12 years, because when that happens the board becomes moribund and stale.''</p>
