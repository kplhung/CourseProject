        <p>After escalating rents forced the Theater for the New City to move four times in 15 years, it bought a rundown city warehouse at 155 First Avenue in 1986 for $717,000 and spent more than $1 million fixing it up. As recently as a year ago the theater, in the East Village between Ninth and 10th Streets, was burdened with a mortgage that is still almost $600,000, plus a $350,000 construction lien on the property that with interest had grown to $550,000.</p>
        <p>But as the result of an intricate agreement last year between the theater, the city and two independent developers who formed a partnership to buy the air rights over the theater, the lien has been repaid and the mortgage will soon be reduced by nearly half. What's more, a 16-story residential condominium will begin rising in a month or so atop the theater.</p>
        <p>The condo, to be known as the New Theater Building, with an address of 240 East 10th Street, will consist of 37 two-  and three-bedroom apartments, including two penthouses. Apartments will range from 1,110 square feet to 1,677 square feet, according to Louise Phillips, a broker for Douglas Elliman, which is handling the sales, and prices will range from $415,000 to almost $800,000. Sales begin  Saturday, with occupancy scheduled for next May.</p>
        <p>Apartment features are to include oversized dual thermopane windows, master baths with stone walls and floors, red oak tongue-and-groove floors and stone countertops. All but three apartments will have balconies or terraces.</p>
        <p>The New Theater Building is being developed by New City Associates, a partnership between the developers Jerry J. Rosengarten and Michael Waldman. The builder is New York Construction Collaborative, and the architect is Schuman Lichtenstein Claman &amp; Efron, both Manhattan firms.</p>
        <p>The condo would not likely have gotten even as far as the drawing boards had it not been for the lien, the result of a dispute between a contractor who said he was owed money and the theater, which claimed that his work was unsatisfactory.</p>
        <p>''But since we bought the building from the city,''  said Crystal Field, the theater's director, ''we went to them and explained our problem and they said if they could find a developer to buy our air rights they'd give us some money toward the lien.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosengarten and Mr. Waldman bought the air rights at auction for $1.2 million. The city paid off the $550,000 lien and the partners agreed to give the theater $100,000 toward the mortgage after the project is completed. The partners are also building new bathrooms for the theater, as well as moving its existing elevator to another part of the lobby.  Meanwhile, the company has also raised $168,000 toward the mortgage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosengarten said that while the purchase and an additional $14 million investment was strictly business, as an arts lover he is delighted that the project will also help a theater that was in jeopardy.</p>
        <p>Ms. Field said she ''couldn't be more pleased; they saved our lives.''</p>
