      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Fur and feathers may be the signature style of many women in hip-hop, but Dawn Robinson prefers a more offbeat look inspired by punk and rock. Lately, on the street and on stage, Ms. Robinson, a singer and songwriter in Lucy Pearl, has been wearing black leather boots by Sky because their S-curve platform heels are unusual. ''Everyone in R&amp;B is into high couture,'' said Ms. Robinson, who was in the glamorous girl group En Vogue from 1989 through 1997. Divas like Lauryn Hill, Madonna and Jennifer Lopez have already discovered the sculptural footwear sold at Jeffrey, at 449 West 14th Street. It costs $230 to $380. Ms. Robinson dresses down the high-style boots by wearing them with a black, asymmetrical Goth skirt by Martin Margiela and an old Sting T-shirt on which she performed a few alterations, cutting off the sleeves and tapering the waist with safety pins. ''The rock T-shirt is antifashion, and I like that the skirt looks like they took it off the bolt,'' she said. ''It's unfinished. It's not perfect. I'm a little punk. It's the Deborah Harry thing. She just did what she wanted.''</p>
