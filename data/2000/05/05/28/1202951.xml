This class is a stepping stone to motivate myself, for I believe that my gift is in my hands.''</p>

        <p>DONELLA LAWSON of Englewood always loved doing arts and crafts projects until she lost her ability to see colors five years ago. Then she stopped painting ceramics, flower arranging and other things. But this spring Ms. Lawson is back ''crafting,'' she says, learning to make pottery in a class for the blind and visually impaired at the Jersey City Museum.</p>
        <p>''In this class we're not even talking about colors,'' Ms. Lawson said. ''We're talking about shape and textures, using your sense of touch. You can feel the depth, the roughness, the smoothness, the density of an object, the relief -- if there is a design. This class is a stepping stone to motivate myself, for I believe that my gift is in my hands.''</p>
        <p>The objects the students make are simple: two plates, a bowl and a cup. The process is complex and rewarding.</p>
        <p>The project is sponsored by VSA arts of New Jersey, part of the international VSA arts network, formerly known as Very Special Arts, started by Jean Kennedy Smith and the John F. Kennedy Performing Arts Center. The organization's purpose is to assure that the arts are available to people with disabilities.</p>
        <p>''This is something I have wanted to do so badly,'' said Mary Fahy of East Rutherford, one of the 12 women and men in the class. Seated at a table, they listened intently as Karen Chasen Spitzberg talked about the history of Jersey City and its potteries. Ms. Spitzberg gave each student pieces to examine and explained how they were made. Martin Rubino, a sculptor who is legally blind, helped the students make the pottery.</p>
        <p>His goal, he said, is to help the students to become more independent. Mr. Rubino has been working with the blind for 25 years. He became legally blind 10 years after graduating from art school.</p>
        <p>''I had to think about what I was doing as a sculptor and what was important,'' Mr. Rubino said. ''Was I going to try to see what I couldn't see? Was I interested in proving to the viewing public that I could be as good as a seeing artist? Or was I interested in, maybe, what I could do as someone who was visually impaired?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rubino said he did not believe that the work of the blind should mimic the work of the sighted. He does not believe, for example, that they need to paint colors if they cannot see them. He has fashioned his own methods to teach people who are visually impaired, and found new ways to communicate about conceptual ideas.</p>
        <p>''Most people who teach -- it's almost subconscious -- will say to someone who is visually impaired, 'Do you see what I mean?' I never say, 'Do you see what I mean?' I don't say to people, 'Just move it a little bit this way.' What I do is I set up a boundary, a very familiar boundary, which is a table, and set up their own studio on the table. I like to give them enough arm movement so no one bumps into anyone else. I try to set up the table so that I can say something is at 12 o'clock or 9 o'clock.''</p>
        <p>After finding out about each student's visual impairment, Mr. Rubino told them: ''You don't need sight for any of this work. O.K.? So I want you to forget about being visually impaired. Because that has nothing to do with our artwork.''</p>
        <p>One of their first jobs was to flatten the clay. ''This is a relationship you have with the clay,'' he said, and they get to work:</p>
        <p>''Mama mia!'' ''It's like cutting halvah.'' ''Talk to me, baby,'' they said as they worked. Then they turned to shaping the clay.</p>
        <p>The artwork of the blind and visually impaired needs to be judged by a different standard, Mr. Rubino said. ''Most people who are visually impaired tend to make shapes that are organic,'' he said. ''They are lumpy and very beautiful and interesting to touch, undulant. It's got ups and downs, valleys and mountains and crevices. For people who are visually impaired, this is what makes it exciting. Sighted people need to touch it to appreciate it.''</p>
        <p>The public will be able to do just that. The pottery made by the blind and visually impaired students will go on exhibit in the education wing of the Jersey City Museum next year after the museum moves to its new headquarters on Montgomery Street.</p>
