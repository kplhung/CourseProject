        <p>Americans are eating better than they were in the 1980's, but the diets of 9 out of 10 still need improvement, federal officials said today.</p>
        <p>Americans should reduce their intake of saturated fats, seek a healthy body weight, reduce sodium in their diet and choose foods and drinks that ''moderate'' their sugar consumption, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Those recommendations are contained in the government's new dietary guidelines, which are updated every five years, and determine, among other things, the nutritional content of lunches served to 26 million schoolchildren every day.</p>
        <p>President Clinton devoted his weekly radio address today to the guidelines, choosing a holiday weekend to address ''our family and friends at picnics and backyard barbecues.''</p>
        <p>Despite progress in eating less fat and more vegetables, ''the vast majority of Americans still don't have healthy diets,'' Mr. Clinton said. He faulted lifestyle changes for aggravating the problem.</p>
        <p>''We're eating more fast food because of our hectic schedules, and we're less physically active because of our growing reliance on modern conveniences, from cars to computers to remote controls,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As a result, Mr. Clinton said, more Americans are obese -- including 1 in 10 children -- placing them at greater risk for heart disease, stroke, cancer and diabetes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton, who is 6-feet-2 inches tall and has a reputation for a hearty appetite and a fondness for fast food, lost about 20 pounds in the year before his 1997 physical examination. He later regained it all, and last November his doctors reported that he weighed 218 pounds. As a result, the White House said at the time, his doctors ''recommended that the president focus again on a low-calorie diet and focus more attention also to his exercise regimen.''</p>
        <p>The guidelines, which are drafted by a joint advisory committee of the Agriculture Department and the Department of Health and Human Services, may seem tame, but twice a decade virtually every phrase is cause for battle between public interest advocates and food producers.</p>
        <p>This year, sugar growers and soft drink manufacturers scored a victory by persuading the administration to alter a draft recommendation from ''go easy on beverages and foods high in added sugars'' to  ''choose beverages and foods to moderate your intake of sugars.''</p>
        <p>''It's unfortunate the government caved in to pressure from junk food makers,'' said Margo G. Wootan, the director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group. ''The sugar industry was out in full force.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wootan, who has a doctorate in nutrition, nevertheless praised the administration for ignoring pressure from salt producers and issuing an explicit message on sodium, ''Eat less.''</p>
        <p>Among the key recommendations:</p>
        <p>*Choose a diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol. Limit fatty meats and high-fat dairy products like cheese; opt for fish and lean poultry, use vegetable oils rather than solid fats.</p>
        <p>*Aim for a healthy weight. One in three adults are overweight, up from one in four just a decade ago. Choose sensible portions at mealtime and get regular physical activity to reduce the risk of heart disease and other maladies.</p>
        <p>*Cut your salt intake. Substitute spices and herbs to flavor food, go easy on soy sauce, ketchup, mustard, pickles and olives, choose plain foods like grilled or roasted entrees when dining out.</p>
        <p>*Moderate your intake of sugars. The No. 1 source of added sugars is in nondiet soft drinks. Other sources include cakes and cookies, fruit drinks and candy. Do not let such foods ruin your appetite for healthful items like low-fat milk.</p>
        <p>*Drink alcohol in moderation. That means no more than one drink per day for women -- a 12-ounce beer or a 5-ounce glass of wine -- and no more than two drinks a day for men.</p>
        <p>The government offered guidance on exercise and handling and storing food safely. Americans can improve their health by exercising moderately every day, the guidelines said. Exercise that speeds up the heart rate and breathing and that builds strength and flexibility is particularly beneficial.</p>
        <p>''Just a brisk 30-minute walk five times a week, for instance, can cut the chance of developing or dying from heart disease in half,'' Mr. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>People can avoid food-borne illnesses by being careful with perishable items like eggs, meats, fish, fresh fruits and milk products. The government urged Americans not to drink unpasteurized juices, raw sprouts and raw or undercooked meat, eggs, fish or shellfish.</p>
        <p>Cooks should wash their hands, utensils and surfaces after handling raw meat, poultry or fish and store them, if necessary, apart from other foods.</p>
