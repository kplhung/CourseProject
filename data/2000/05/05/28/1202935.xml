        <p>AT Waterloo Village's music and food festival next weekend, Marcia Ball is likely to stand out -- for two reasons. The first one is that her powerhouse New Orleans-styled rhythm and blues performance fits perfectly with the Cajun and zydeco theme.</p>
        <p>The second comes from her latest album, ''Let Me Play With Your Poodle.'' A particular cut, ''Crawfishin','' is what the two-day annual event in Stanhope is all about.</p>
        <p>Inspired by the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, New Jersey's Crawfish Festival will, for the 11th year, bring together musicians and chefs from around the country (but mostly from the Big Easy), for a genuine two-day crawfish jubilee.</p>
        <p>The little critters, 15,000 strong, will be flown in from the bayou, straight to 1,000-gallon pots of boiling Stanhope water. There will also be jambalaya, po' boys, shrimp Creole, etoufee, fried catfish and even alligator sausage. All to be eaten, while lounging on the large lawn listening to some of the top Cajun, zydeco, funk, Louisiana rhythm and blues, rock and gospel bands.</p>
        <p>Besides the barrelhouse boogie of Ms. Ball, the weekend's musical highlights include Buckwheat Zydeco and his big band filled out by horns, bluesy guitar licks and Creole rhythms. Buckwheat Zydeco, a four-time Grammy nominee, was the keyboard player for such zydeco, soul and blues stars as Clifton Chenier, Joe Tex and Gatemouth Brown. But past credits aside, it is his own Hammond B-3 and accordion playing that draws the accolades.</p>
        <p>Another top-notch act performing on the bill is the Funky Meters, who have been around for more than 30 years and have included such illustrious personnel as Art Neville (of the Neville Brothers) on organ and Zigaboo Modeliste on percussion. Formerly known as the Meters, their distinctive blues-dance groove forced the truth-in-advertising name change. These are the masters of the swamp-rock that makes Crescent City music so popular.</p>
        <p>The Radiators, whose cultish fans are called Fish Heads, are known for their gumbo mix of assorted American influences -- R&amp;B, country, soul, swing and gospel -- all filtered through their New Orleans-style rock 'n' roll.</p>
        <p>Less known is John Mooney, who has been called the ''King of White Blues.'' He and his band, Bluesiana, serve up blues as thick and smoky as the air in a Beale Street bar in Memphis.</p>
        <p>Other performers include Walter (Wolfman) Washington, an imaginative soul-gospel guitarist who will be performing with his taut Roadmasters. Terrence Simien's good-time music, low-slung accordion and Sam Cooke-sounding vocals are crowd pleasers, too. File, a roof-raising combo featuring four vocalists, Ward Lormand's Cajun accordion playing and D'Jalma Garnier's fiery Creole fiddling.</p>
        <p>Two local bands will perform. Barbecue Bob and the Spareribs is a New Jersey-based blues, rockabilly and country band. The Black Widow Band features a diverse horn section.</p>
        <p>There will also be crafts, like hand-carved cypress decoys and roux stirrers, a French market, African art, Bayou bandannas and CD's. Children may enjoy Mardi Gras mask making and tic tac toe with crawfish and crabs.</p>
        <p>CRAWFISH FESTIVAL  Waterloo Village, 525 Waterloo Road, Stanhope.</p>
        <p>Next Saturday and Sunday at 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.  (973) 347-0900.</p>
