        <p>I read with some interest ''Another Threat to Nassau Residents' Taxes'' [May 7], concerning the lawsuit by 36 commercial property owners alleging that they are being assessed a disproportionate share of county real estate taxes.</p>
        <p>If these landlords use a standard office lease, their taxes are factored into the monthly rent paid by their tenants. Moreover, there is a standard clause in every lease providing for the tenant to ''pay an additional rent'' for any year ''if the taxes for any tax year shall be greater than the base tax.''</p>

        <p>Last month my suitemate and I in Jericho were assessed over $1,000 to cover our ''proportionate share'' (the phrase in the standard lease) of our landlord's county assessment. Every tenant in our building was assessed an additional amount to cover the landlord's tax increase.</p>
        <p>Thus it would seem that the plaintiffs are crying with the proverbial ''loaf of bread under each arm.''</p>
