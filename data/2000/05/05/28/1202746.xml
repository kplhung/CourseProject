        <p>THE WATER IN BETWEEN</p>
        <p>A Journey at Sea.</p>
        <p>By Kevin Patterson.</p>
        <p>289 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Nan A. Talese/Doubleday. $23.95.</p>
        <p>''In August of 1994, I bought a 20-year-old ferrocement ketch on the coast of British Columbia. I did this in an effort to distract myself -- at the time I was so absorbed in self-pity that my eyes were crossed.'' So begins this tale of sailing back and forth across the Pacific by Kevin Patterson, who at the age of 29 found himself loveless, directionless and as sour as Hamlet after three dreary years as a Canadian Army doctor posted to an artillery base in Manitoba. (Who wouldn't be?) He conceived the idea of refreshing his soul by sailing to Tahiti, that ever-beckoning paradise, never mind that he had never been in a sailboat before and could barely tell a rudder from a bowsprit. Acedia, incompetence and ferrocement -- all the makings of a decent sea yarn. Add to those literary skills, wide reading, a decent humanity, humor, a Global Positioning Satellite receiver, a Force 9 gale and you have ''The Water In Between,'' a delightful, finely written and, in the end, wise book.</p>
        <p>It succeeds against a number of odds. First, there is no longer much novelty left in the genre. The damp, drizzly November-in-my-soul impetus to go to sea has been around since Ishmael started knocking the hats off people he passed. And it's been over a century now since Joshua Slocum, the grandfather of modern nautical literary types, completed the circumnavigation that resulted in his masterpiece and best seller, ''Sailing Alone Around the World.'' All books since on the theme of putting to sea in small sailboats -- alone or not -- are footnotes to Slocum. Patterson himself freely admits that no one, really, has equaled the old New Englander's nautical or literary accomplishments.</p>
        <p>At this point, there isn't a whole lot of novelty left in setting off across the wide Pacific. This fact was surely emphasized a few months ago when with fanfare a Frenchman announced his intention to walk across the Pacific. This was not merely normal Gallic self-regard: he was going to walk it, on mini-canoes attached to his feet. (Don't ask.) He had to be rescued by the Coast Guard a week after setting out from Los Angeles. Your tax dollars at work.</p>
        <p>Then there is Patterson's voyage aboard the Sea Mouse. No spectacular disasters befell. He spends mind-numbing weeks becalmed in the horse latitudes (so named, he interestingly reveals, because in the old days when becalmed here, thirsty mariners would pitch the poor things overboard). No whale staves him in, no shark eats his rudder. He encounters no perfect storms, though the gale that strikes him toward the end is genuinely harrowing, and will, like Sebastian Junger's, make a permanent landlubber of you.</p>
        <p>Patterson does not fall in love with a beautiful Tahitian woman and swoon beneath palms. What romantic moments there are occur in flashbacks to a dreary love affair with an overcomplicated, overencumbered woman in Paris. The islands he visits -- Hawaii, Palmyra, Penrhyn Atoll in the north Cook Islands and Tahiti -- are past their paradisiacal prime. Oahu is a shopping mall with sand in the parking lot. Tahiti is overcrowded, expensive, dirty and full of French officials with quadruplicate forms. But some of the islands in between have their charms, and Patterson gives us vignettes of losers and loners out of Graham Greene or Somerset Maugham.</p>
        <p>For all these apparent disadvantages, Patterson came back with a first-rate, quietly enthralling account that belongs on the shelf with Paul Theroux's ''Happy Isles of Oceania,'' Jonathan Raban's sailings and, for that matter, with the work of the landlubber Bruce Chatwin. Given that this is Patterson's first book, and that he is by training a doctor, that's not bad at all.</p>
        <p>If today's sea stories are footnotes to Slocum, the ghost of Bruce Chatwin hovers over modern-day travel books. Chatwin, the author of ''In Patagonia'' and ''The Songlines,'' among other books, died of AIDS in 1989. Since then, he has become the secular saint of the vagabond genre, and there's been a lot of genuflecting at his movable shrine. His talent and charisma were, to be sure, large. Patterson comes to his shrine to pray, but stays to point out its problems. This part of ''The Water In Between'' is bound to stir controversy among Chatwinites. But it's an argument worth having. Patterson is on solid ground in his dissent on Chatwin's misanthropy and cynicism.</p>
        <p>Which is to say that Patterson's book is about much more than getting a 37-foot boat all the way from Victoria, British Columbia, to Tahiti and back in one piece. He spent a lot of those three years on the desolate artillery range in Manitoba in morose but not unproductive solitude in his cabin, drinking Frangelico liqueur and reading deeply. He brought good books along on the trip too, and we get penetrating glosses on literary travelers from Homer to Melville, Robert Louis Stevenson, Somerset Maugham, Rupert Brooke, Redmond O'Hanlon, Eric Newby, Slocum and others.</p>
        <p>There's a fascinating discussion of the eccentric French sailor Bernard Moitessier, who in 1968 set off on a solo round-the-world race. Six months into it, as he was victoriously turning on the final leg, he had an epiphany and realized that he had lost all desire to win, whereupon he turned the tiller about and -- kept going. He went one and a half times around the world, 10 months all by himself on a 40-foot sailboat. Pourquoi? you might well ask. (What is it with these nautical Frenchies?) Patterson will explain it all to you -- what's more, in a way that actually makes sense.</p>
        <p>The section on Donald Crowhurst, who also competed in that 1968 race, makes good reading. Crowhurst, realizing that he was behind the others and would not catch up, devised a scheme whereby he would sail in circles in the South Atlantic while radioing in fake progress reports, then turn north and cross the finish line ahead of the others. At this point, madness began to set in. He kept voluminous logbooks full of weirdly brilliant philosophical riffs. Then, one night, like Edwin Arlington Robinson's Richard Cory, he calmly stepped off the transom into the black water. (Robert Stone took some of his inspiration for his novel ''Outerbridge Reach'' from the bizarre Crowhurst saga.)</p>
        <p>Remarking on Crowhurst's last diary entry, Patterson writes: ''As I read this book I fought back tears most of the time. I sympathized with Crowhurst as a fellow liar. He had imagined himself brave and stalwart, out there on that sea. He represented himself as stoically and cheerfully charging out across the ocean, happy in his own company. He embraced the lie presented by Slocum and Hillary and all the grand explorers -- that endurance and isolation ennoble.''</p>
        <p>That sentence is at the heart of the discovery that Patterson makes on his own voyage. It is part of his argument against Chatwinism, and in this dispute he has a trump card to play. (You'll find it on Page 279.)</p>
        <p>He quotes a passage from Peter Fleming's ''News From Tartary'' that provides a wry note of self-awareness: ''He who starts on a ride of 2,000 or 3,000 miles may experience, at the moment of departure, a variety of emotions. He may feel excited, sentimental, anxious, carefree, heroic, roistering, picaresque, introspective or practically anything else; but above all he must and will feel like a fool.'' Patterson travels light.</p>
        <p>He had companions with him on the journey -- thank heavens, given his inexperience. A knowledgeable man named Don Lang accompanied him outbound, and various others helped him bring the Sea Mouse home from French Polynesia. But on the last leg from Hawaii, 3,000 miles, he went it alone. That final solitude and the storm give the final pages narrative depth and literary gravitas.</p>
        <p>His account of limping into Bamfield Harbor on Vancouver Island -- out of gas, out of everything -- of the joy he took in the cheeseburger and ice-cold beers at the bar, of the hourlong hot shower at the motel, is among the most amusingly rapturous homecomings in the annals of sea literature. Odysseus wasn't any happier to reach Ithaca after 10 years. Those who've crossed oceans v-e-r-y slowly in sailboats will understand. But those who haven't will still take pleasure in Patterson's reaffirmation that when all is said and Donne it's true, no man is an island.</p>
