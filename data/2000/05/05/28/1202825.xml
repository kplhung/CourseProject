        <p>LEONTYNE PRICE, the reigning diva of the 1960's and 70's, was chatting with National Public Radio during intermission in a broadcast from the San Francisco Opera. Who, the interviewer asked, were the singers who had shown Ms. Price the way? The last of the names she rattled off in the tones of an empress was ''La Callas.'' She had turned opera into something people really cared about, Ms. Price said, ''like baseball.''</p>
        <p>Like baseball, all the arts need their heroes. But the art of opera, unlike baseball or hockey or skiing or even tennis, belongs to a frightening degree to custodians who choose to live in the past. ''The garland briefer than a girl's,'' A. E. Housman called the athlete's glory in a famous poem; in sports, records exist to be shattered. But the vestals of opera (critics, biographers, a vocal clique of reactionary fans) treat the starry dead like so many Babe Ruths, and the living like riffraff from a farm team in an age when the major leagues have ceased to exist.</p>
        <p>The public at large wants nothing more than to be swept away in real time, as the nightly, obligatory ovations in our major opera houses prove. To some, those ovations merely prove how deep the art has sunk. ''Madame So-and-So was just a house soprano in the Polish provinces,'' say the censorious, who are incapable of enjoyment but cannot stay away. ''If she came along today, she could write her own ticket from Vienna, Milan and London to New York and San Francisco.''</p>
        <p>Yes, yes. And if we could travel back to any era we liked, what would we find? A few real divinities here and there, working their miracles against the backdrop mostly of mere routine if not mediocrity and incompetence. Much has changed in the world, but not this. Chronicles of those who were there make this truth very clear. So, in their way, do field trips to the provinces, where time stands still. (Try Parma.)</p>
        <p>For Ms. Price, Callas was no death's head but a spur to greatness. Why should it be otherwise today? The most important lesson Callas taught her fellow artists was that at the level of genius, a performer is as much a creator as a playwright, a composer, a choreographer. The same sovereignty of imagination that transforms experience into an ''original'' work of art may be brought to bear on the realization of the words and notes on the page or the steps of a dance in performance. Such art is perishable -- it is consumed in its creation -- but it is not of a lesser order. And it leaves its traces.</p>
        <p>What opera needs, at least as much as great voices, is great personalities. Not ''divas,'' in the debased sense of egomaniacs with mannerisms, but intrepid explorers of the human condition, each a Ulysses who has traveled far, seen much, felt deeply. Explorers who convey the fullness of experience through music, word and gesture, touching, in ways unique to themselves, the chord of the universal. At this level, singing a role is no more an act of ''reproduction'' than writing it in the first place.</p>
        <p>A current truism of operatic commentary (echoed also in criticism of instrumentalists and conductors) is that conservatories and young-artist programs are churning out interchangeable nonentities, good boys and girls who are well prepared but anonymous. The old Countess of Tchaikovsky's ''Queen of Spades'' speaks for fogies of all ages as she mourns the gilded memory of her youth: ''Who are the dancers now?'' she asks. ''Who sings? Little nobodies.''</p>
        <p>Little nobodies? Actually, there are quite a few candidates for induction in the Olympian hall of fame out there, at or near their prime. The bewitching Cecilia Bartoli, the Dickensian Bryn Terfel and the glamorous Renee Fleming are three whose names come instantly to mind, but they are not alone.</p>
        <p>Looking no farther than the Metropolitan Opera, we have seen within recent seasons the radiant Finnish soprano Karita Mattila as Elsa in ''Lohengrin,'' the sumptuous Russian mezzo-soprano Olga Borodina as the Philistine siren in Saint-Saens's ''Samson et Dalila'' and the German Rene Pape, noblest of basses, as a pair of Wagnerian kings.</p>
        <p>As for Jane Eaglen, the heroine of Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde'' and ''Der Ring des Nibelungen'' this season, is she the long-awaited Real Thing or the next Rita Hunter? That singer -- not so towering as Ms. Eaglen but equally larger than life -- was another dramatic soprano from England, praised to the skies by the Anglophile music critic Andrew Porter, whose English translation of the ''Ring'' she sang and recorded with the English National Opera. Mr. Porter did his vain best to sell her to the American public but had to admit that her appearances in New York never lived up to the showing she made in London.</p>
        <p>To do her justice, Ms. Hunter gave value for money in daunting assignments when no one else was at hand to do better. So does Ms. Eaglen. But does she leave a lasting imaginative stamp on the characters she plays? It may be too soon to say.</p>
        <p>As the doll in ''Les Contes d'Hoffmann'' -- visibly expecting, whirling on point while tossing off the most brilliant, intricate and altitudinous roulades -- the French coloratura soprano Natalie Dessay did so for sure. Catherine Malfitano's Emilia Marty in ''The Makropulos Case'' was an electrifying creation, hailed as such by critics and audiences alike. The Carmen of Waltraud Meier, slammed in the press, struck me as no less authentic and persuasive.</p>
        <p>Across the plaza at the New York City Opera, Lauren Flanigan this season found in Susan B. Anthony, of Virgil Thomson's ''Mother of Us All,'' an assignment to justify the sometimes hyperbolic praise her fierce, unsentimental, even bitter interpretations regularly generate. The countertenor Bejun Mehta, breathing fire in music of Handel at City Opera, and even more in his out-of-the-blue debut with Millennial Arts Productions, has demonstrated decidedly mythic potential. Alas, Angela Gheorghiu's Violetta in ''La Traviata,'' once announced by the Met, never materialized hereabouts; but in a video from Covent Garden, her disarming portrayal combines the personal beauty and warmth of a Julia Roberts with the haunting vocal pathos of a Claudia Muzio. We definitely missed something there.</p>
        <p>Argue as we may about particulars, Olympians are very much with us. And among them, there is a particularly rare, particularly fascinating subspecies, metaphorically the most operatic of them all. Call them the sacred monsters. As the term suggests, there is in these uncompromising, stubborn, even nettlesome creatures at least a touch of the demonic. They are laws unto themselves. They must have their way. Olympians go the distance. Sacred monsters go too far. They conquer and divide.</p>
        <p>Mr. Terfel is one, though less controversial than some. His performances have of late taken on a histrionic, highly italicized character some critics suggest he might tone down. Mr. Terfel knows what they think and proceeds his way, undeterred.</p>
        <p>With more dubious wisdom, Ms. Gheorghiu once refused to manage a phrase of Verdi's as Georg Solti gently insisted, setting her own naive, literalistic notions above the experience and expertise of his long lifetime. Talent and a rage for control may be two sides of a single coin.</p>
        <p>The epitome of the sacred monster at the moment is surely the Argentine tenor Jose Cura, 38. So far, New Yorkers have seen him just three times, in a single production, as the Sicilian lothario Turiddu in Mascagni's ''Cavalleria Rusticana,'' amid the wreckage of the once picturesque staging by Franco Zeffirelli, woefully led by Carlo Rizzi and partnered by the uncongenial Santuzza of Dolora Zajick. Thanks to Placido Domingo in his capacity as artistic director of the Washington Opera, audiences in the capital have taken Mr. Cura's measure in two of his signature roles: Saint-Saens's Samson and Verdi's Otello.</p>
        <p>In the biblical spectacular, he bore the destiny of the despondent Chosen People on heroic shoulders, his prophetic song ringing forth with dark, blazing grandeur. His authority was total. But his last Washington ''Otello'' this spring was an altogether more daring affair. Of the British stage idol Edmund Kean, Samuel Coleridge wrote, ''To see him act is like reading Shakespeare by flashes of lightning,'' and so it was with Mr. Cura in Verdi's Shakespearean mode.</p>
        <p>Praise or censure? That depends on your point of view. Between lightning flashes fell long spells of pitch dark. On prior occasions in Europe, Mr. Cura had executed the notes with a scrupulousness that had only boosted his tremendous conception of the part. This time, rather than sing the music, he chose to channel the character. Call it extreme music drama, and say, if you can, whether it unfolded through or in spite of the music. Over the radio or on a recording, it might have sounded grotesque, but it was hair-raising to be there.</p>
        <p>Among those who witnessed Mr. Cura's Washington Otello is Barbara Cook, the Broadway star of midcentury who created the roles of Marian the Librarian in ''The Music Man'' and Cunegonde in ''Candide,'' and continues to wrap audiences around her finger in cabaret and concert performances. (One prominent London critic has repeatedly placed her artistry on a par with that of Callas.)</p>
        <p>Unlike critics, whose professional obligation to endure upward of a hundred evenings of opera a year many have patently come to regret, Ms. Cook has the luxury of attending purely as the spirit moves her. For the last year or so, between engagements of her own, she has traveled as far afield as Madrid, Paris and London to keep up with Mr. Cura's performances.</p>
        <p>Why such devotion? ''It's the total package,'' Ms. Cook said recently. ''In any era, only a very few people are at the pinnacle. I can't think of anybody who sings as well, who acts as well, who moves as well. It's like watching a great baseball player who has this terrific masculine grace. Whatever things might be wrong with Jose's performances, he has a concentration that pulls you right into his world.''</p>
        <p>This weekend, viewers in more than a hundred countries will be tuning in for their Cura fix in a live telecast of ''La Traviata,'' spread out over installments on Saturday and Sunday, and shot in what are billed as authentic Paris locations. (Cinema verite meets Masterpiece Theater.) The prima donna is the hitherto unknown Eteri Gvazava, of Siberia, cast, Mr. Cura says, after the sort of talent search that produced Hollywood's Scarlett O'Hara.</p>
        <p>By rights, Verdi's tragedy of the fallen woman redeemed by suffering is the soprano's opera, but this time it may be the tenor's. Not that Alfredo Germont, the romantic but callow bourgeois papa's boy who woos Violetta from her life of soulless pleasure, is the sort of character one associates with Mr. Cura's brooding macho presence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cura has admitted as much, adding: ''Alfredo has gotten the greatest courtesan in Paris to give up everything for him. There must be a reason.'' Americans may decide for themselves in the fall, when the show is expected to appear on PBS; a Teldec CD of the soundtrack, conducted by Zubin Mehta, goes on sale here in July.</p>
        <p>TO a degree seldom if ever matched in the annals of opera, Mr. Cura -- also a composer and conductor -- marches to his own drum. On ''Verismo,'' his latest CD for Erato, he dedicates a whole program to a style of the late 19th and early 20th centuries commonly thought vulgar and sensationalistic. Acting as his own conductor, he sets out to redefine it as a school of chaste refinement.</p>
        <p>In the hit-and-run show stopper ''Amor ti vieta,'' from Giordano's dismal ''Fedora,'' the delicacy of the phrasing (lines taken in a single breath alternating with lines of similar length taken in two) is as unusual as it is natural and discreet. There are discoveries like this to be made throughout. And nowhere will you find Mr. Cura clinging, in self-indulgent spaghetti-tenor fashion, to top notes the composer actually wrote or did not.</p>
        <p>On his very best vocal behavior, Mr. Cura here gives the lie to those who have said that he has no technique. What we hear, by contrast, in such daredevil performances as the Washington ''Otello'' is a self-conscious, highly idiosyncratic technique fraught with peril. How well it will serve Mr. Cura in the long run remains to be seen. Self-immolation is not actually required of sacred monsters, but longevity is not always their strong suit.</p>
        <p>Whatever lies ahead, Mr. Cura has already earned his place as one of the most supremely original performers of the age. But gentler Olympians, too, are capable of redefining the terms by which the game is played.</p>
        <p>Consider the case of Ms. Fleming. For the last few seasons, it has seemed that she can do no wrong. In Mozart and Strauss, audiences delight in her floating pianissimo. In bel canto, she dazzles with her coloratura and impromptu leaps to the stratosphere. William Christie, the Baroque specialist, who recently collaborated with her on Handel's ''Alcina,'' went wild for her rococo inflections, a carry-over from her youthful experience in jazz. The sold-out signs go up even when she sings a contemporary, all-American program.</p>
        <p>By common consent, the foundation on which Ms. Fleming's stardom rests is the sheer beauty of her voice, a property as axiomatic as the propositions of Euclid. John Kander -- the composer of ''The Visit,'' due on Broadway next spring, starring Angela Lansbury, and such indestructible hits as ''Chicago'' and ''Cabaret'' -- is the sort of opera fan who looks for more.</p>
        <p>''Opera has played a great role in my life, but not for the high-C songbirds,'' Mr. Kander said recently. ''When I was still a boy, I fell in love with the people, the people in 'La Boheme,' in 'Die Meistersinger,' in 'Der Rosenkavalier,' in 'Pelleas et Melisande.' Those people became very real to me. They still are.''</p>
        <p>And is Ms. Fleming just a high-C songbird? ''When she's done a role a number of times, and she's really into it,'' he said, ''she gives wonderful lessons.'' The first example that comes to his mind is from ''Der Rosenkavalier'' this season. In the nick of time, the Marschallin stops herself from blurting out to her young lover what happened once when her husband barged in on her unannounced.</p>
        <p>''Before that one word 'einmal,'  'once,' she gave the dirtiest laugh,'' Mr. Kander said. ''I loved it. A real snicker. It told me something about that woman.'' That she's not ashamed? ''Yes, that, and that she's had some swell times.''</p>
        <p>I remember that nuance, and others, not all of them vocal. From time immemorial, the Marschallin has spent the calm and sensuous yet depressed orchestral postlude of the first act gazing in her mirror, facing in her reflection the relentless passage of time. Ms. Fleming instead worked with a rose.</p>
        <p>By this point, she had already turned the silver rose for the young bride Sophie von Fanninal into a bittersweet emblem of the Marschallin's own lost youth. But that rose, in its fancy presentation case, had just been carried from the room. On a dressing table lay another one, cut from a garden, a gift from the flighty hairdresser whose ministrations this morning she feels have made her look old. Ms. Fleming picked it up and found the hard truth of the moment that way, sweeping away an entire performance tradition in an image many a future Marschallin could choose to follow.</p>
        <p>A speaking glance no one could anticipate. A gesture, an inflection, a tone or phrase that unlocks a world. A radical rethinking of a well-known role or the incandescent creation of a new one. These are the stuff memories are made of. But there is something better than memories: fresh experience in the here and now. Now and again, lightning strikes. Keep your eyes wide open. Dreams can wait.</p>
