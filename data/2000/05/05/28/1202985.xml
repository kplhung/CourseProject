        <p>Jeff Kalin is a primitive technologist, eking out a living in the woods of Connecticut selling handmade prehistoric replicas. Mr. Kalin is also in demand at powwows and museum shows, carting his flint tools and  gourds from one demonstration to the next.</p>
        <p>''I'm outside loading up a bark wigwam,'' he told a caller before a recent thunderstorm. ''I'll be in when it's dark or I'm wet.''</p>
        <p>He has been transforming a 16-foot white pine log into a dugout canoe at the Hudson River Museum in Yonkers. First he sets the log on fire, burning away ''the non-canoe part'' the way Michelangelo liberated David from stone. Then he chops and scrapes the way the ancients did.</p>
        <p>The public can watch him at work in the museum's courtyard on June 8, 11 and 18 from noon to 4:30 p.m. The vessel will be part of the museum's exhibition ''Boats on the Hudson: Navigating Through History,'' which opens July 7 and runs through next Jan. 7.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kalin also makes stone weapons and utensils, but here his creativity has taken flight. Instead of shaping arrowheads from pieces of flint and quartz, he now fashions bears, dolphins and whales. ''Something clicked, and I realized it was sculpture,'' he said.</p>
