        <p>Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin was never an angel. Away from the field, Irvin and trouble were often good pals. But as a player, he was one of the toughest, at times most spectacular, pass catchers of the past decade. Now he faces retirement because of a spinal injury.</p>
        <p>San Francisco wide receiver Jerry Rice is considered by many to be the best ever at his position. But he has been in a battle with his longtime team, which has considered cutting him for salary cap reasons. A deal will probably be worked out soon, but the fact that the team even contemplated releasing Rice is surreal.</p>

        <p>Dallas Cowboys wide receiver Michael Irvin was never an angel. Away from the field, Irvin and trouble were often good pals. But as a player, he was one of the toughest, at times most spectacular, pass catchers of the past decade. Now he faces retirement because of a spinal injury.</p>
        <p>San Francisco wide receiver Jerry Rice is considered by many to be the best ever at his position. But he has been in a battle with his longtime team, which has considered cutting him for salary cap reasons. A deal will probably be worked out soon, but the fact that the team even contemplated releasing Rice is surreal.</p>
        <p>Andre Reed played for the Buffalo Bills for 15 seasons before recently being cut. He is second on the career reception list with 941. He is also looking for a job.</p>
        <p>This is the tough part of football, watching great players at the end of their careers struggle with their mortality. Irvin, Rice and Reed have had spectacular professional lives, yet all three are now wondering how things will end, in some cases struggling physically, and in others, getting little interest from teams because of their ages.</p>
        <p>Irvin was one of the main reasons the Cowboys won Super Bowls XXVII, XXVIII and XXX. He holds every significant team receiving record and is among the top 10 in National Football League history in receptions and yards.</p>
        <p>Recently age has caught up with Irvin. He has 1 touchdown catch in the last 20 games -- in the previous 10 seasons, he averaged 6 touchdown catches a year, and had 10 in 1995.</p>
        <p>Then came that disastrous day in Philadelphia last season. On Oct. 10 at Veterans Stadium, Irvin's head hit the turf awkwardly after he was tackled, and doctors later discovered that he has a narrow spinal cord that makes him susceptible to serious injury if he takes a blow to the head or neck. He has not played since that game.</p>
        <p>Doctors recently advised Irvin that he should never play again, and he is mulling retirement. One Cowboys team official said in an interview last week that Irvin had had a difficult time reaching his decision and had been extremely emotional. The official also said that even though Irvin planned to announce his retirement in the coming weeks, there were still days when he went back and forth and considered trying to play again next season.</p>
        <p>''I know it's hard on him,'' Dallas running back Emmitt Smith said. ''It's hard on any man that has to put down the game in the fashion that he has to put it down. It's a tough situation. Nobody wants to go out like that.''</p>
        <p>Rice is fighting a similar battle. He wants to finish his career in San Francisco, and he probably will. But it has not been easy. The 49ers wanted Rice to take a serious pay cut or they threatened to release him. Since then both sides have neared a compromise, but once the season begins, Rice will have to deal with another difficult aspect.</p>
        <p>The 49ers will have to find a way to both satisfy Rice, who still believes he is a first-option pass catcher, as well as their other younger receivers. Rice is prone to complain if he does not get the ball enough, and would probably do so again if not enough passes were thrown his way.</p>
        <p>Reed did his share of complaining last season with the Bills as his role diminished. This off-season the team decided to cut the cord with Reed, who was Buffalo's fourth-round pick in 1985. His career numbers are dazzling. He has 941 catches for 13,095 yards and 86 touchdowns.</p>
        <p>But now he cannot catch on with another team, and he is trying. Chances are another team will pick him up later this summer, but right now teams want to wait until after the June 1 cut day and see if other wide receivers, younger ones, are available. Reed could end up with his former general manager, Bill Polian, now in Indianapolis.</p>
        <p>Soon, fans may be forced to watch the three men go through some uncomfortable times. Irvin will probably retire, and Rice and Reed will try to play with declining skills. Still, the place in history of Irvin, Rice and Reed is assured, especially for the latter two, who are locks for the Hall of Fame. And Irvin has a good chance of joining them in Canton, Ohio, as well.</p>
        <p>Owners Reward Assistants</p>
        <p>The N.F.L.'s owners meetings last week produced some interesting news. Among the topics:</p>
        <p>*When the league expands to 32 teams in 2002 with the addition of the Houston franchise, the number of playoff teams will most likely swell from 12 to 14. The last time the league increased the size of its playoff field was in 1990, from 10 to 12 teams.</p>
        <p>*The N.F.L. expanded its ''violent crime policy'' -- now called the ''personal conduct policy.'' The additions make good sense. The league's screening process of incoming players will now include testing, interviewing and evaluating at the annual scouting combine. There will also be a mandatory intervention process to support and counsel at-risk players as well as the training of coaches by professional counselors to identify at-risk players.</p>
        <p>*Hundreds of assistant coaches, through the N.F.L. Coaches Association, for months have been negotiating with the league for improved benefits. The main goal of the coaches was to lower the retirement age from 65. Coaches wanted to use a formula that would allow them to receive retirement benefits once a combination of age and years in service reaches 75. In other words, if an assistant is 50 years old, and has coached in the league for 25 years, he would be eligible to retire and receive benefits.</p>
        <p>The coaches got their wish. Owners approved that new retirement formula by a vote of 30-1. That is a victory for the assistant coaches who were seriously contemplating a lawsuit against the owners. This also shows that owners will at least listen to a convincing argument, which the assistants had.</p>
        <p>''We're just happy the owners have done something significant for the coaches,'' said Larry Kennan, executive director of the coaches association. ''The owners were very gracious and we are appreciative of that.''</p>
        <p>The assistant coaches believe that the N.F.L. might set up a committee of owners and head coaches to address the future concerns of assistants.</p>
        <p>Incomplete Hostility</p>
        <p>Mike Shanahan was coach of the Oakland Raiders over a decade ago and was fired by the owner, Al Davis, after just 20 games. Shanahan became coach of the Denver Broncos in 1995 and since then is 9-1 against the Raiders.</p>
        <p>The current hostility between Shanahan and Davis was rooted in Shanahan's dismissal and never subsided. One example of the animosity,  from several years ago, was when Shanahan asked quarterback Elvis Grbac during warm-ups to throw a pass in the direction of Davis. The ball barely missed Davis's head. Davis then turned and made an obscene gesture toward Shanahan.</p>
        <p>The battle between the two men and their organizations escalated last weekend. Davis publicly complained that Denver circumvented the salary cap by deferring $22 million in total payments to running back Terrell Davis and the retired quarterback John Elway.</p>
        <p>Pat Bowlen, the Denver owner, contends he did not know the payments had to be made immediately, and once informed otherwise by Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, made those payments at once. Bowlen said Davis was making the charges because the Broncos consistently beat Oakland.</p>
        <p>The idea of salary-cap violations goes beyond the Broncos and Raiders and is a hot topic in the league right now. The Pittsburgh Steelers were recently fined $150,000 by the N.F.L. for secretly agreeing to pay offensive tackle Will Wolford $400,000.</p>
        <p>San Francisco is also under investigation for possible salary-cap abuses.</p>
