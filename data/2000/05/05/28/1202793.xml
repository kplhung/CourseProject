      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Thank you for the entire scope of your special issue. The discussion on psychotherapy moderated by Ariel Kaminer inspired me to write and reminded me of an undervalued piece of equipment in its practice: the office door (''What Do We Talk About When We Are Paying Someone to Listen?''). I often use the hinged door as a metaphor to describe the complementary value of opening and closing -- disclosure and boundedness. I find the moment that the door opens to be a point when my curiosity and energy are engaged. And while your pictorial essay on psychiatrists' offices was illuminating, I would feel remiss not to draw your attention to the door.</p>
