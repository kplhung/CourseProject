      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In addition to its opulent furnishings and enviable location just off the majestic Piazza del Popolo, Rome's recently reopened Hotel de Russie vaunts a special attraction for a hotel in the center of the city: a garden, three-quarters of an acre with towering palms, magnolias, orange trees, rosebushes, a small grotto and fountain.</p>
        <p>The hotel reopened last month after a two-year restoration. Situated in an early 19th-century palazzo, it was for many years a haunt of Russian dignitaries -- hence its name. It was also a favorite among cultural celebrities: Picasso, Cocteau and Stravinsky are among those who have signed the guest book.</p>

        <p>In addition to its opulent furnishings and enviable location just off the majestic Piazza del Popolo, Rome's recently reopened Hotel de Russie vaunts a special attraction for a hotel in the center of the city: a garden, three-quarters of an acre with towering palms, magnolias, orange trees, rosebushes, a small grotto and fountain.</p>
        <p>The hotel reopened last month after a two-year restoration. Situated in an early 19th-century palazzo, it was for many years a haunt of Russian dignitaries -- hence its name. It was also a favorite among cultural celebrities: Picasso, Cocteau and Stravinsky are among those who have signed the guest book.</p>
        <p>During World War II the palazzo was taken over by the Italian military secret service and used as their center of operations. It then became the headquarters of RAI, Italy's state television and radio, until seven years ago.</p>
        <p>The hotel, part of the RF Hotels chain, was overhauled in the $18 million renovation. There are 129 bedrooms including 27 suites, each with two-line telephones, voice mail and satellite television. The decor combines diverse styles: Baroque headboards coexist with minimalist television stands and photographs of flowers by Robert Mapplethorpe.</p>
        <p>In summer, the restaurant and bar service spills into the garden, whose terraced slopes climb to join the Pincio Hill and the Villa Borghese, Rome's liveliest public park. Next month a spa with a Turkish bath, sauna, gym and beauty salon is scheduled to open.</p>
        <p>Room prices start at $269 for a single, based on 2,190 lire to the dollar, and go up to $1,461 for the Picasso suite, which has lithographs by the artist. Prices do not include VAT or breakfast, which ranges between $17 and $25 a person. Hotel de Russie, 9 Via del Babuino, 00187 Rome; (39-06) 328881; fax (39-06) 32888888.</p>
