        <p>SISTER MARGARET BRIODY was a young nun in training in Amityville when the Cuban missile crisis hit in 1962.</p>
        <p>People streamed into her church, Queen of the Rosary Chapel, to light candles and pray that nuclear missiles would not rain down on the United States. She remembers because it was her job to replenish the votive candles and she could barely keep them stocked.</p>
        <p>''Those were very tense times,'' she recalled. ''People were very worried we might go to war.''</p>
        <p>The threat seemed especially real in Amityville because a missile base sat next to the campus of buildings owned by the Sisters of St. Dominic. Throughout the missile crisis, she said, uniformed soldiers could be seen rushing about, aiming 40-foot-long Nike anti-aircraft missiles at the sky to shoot down any enemy bombers that might come. Unbeknownst to residents at the time, those missiles were fitted with nuclear warheads, some more than twice as powerful as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima. The instruments of nuclear Armaggeddon were literally in their backyards.</p>
        <p>To protect New York City -- an obvious target for any enemy -- 19 missile bases were built in the suburbs surrounding the city. Long Island had five sites, in Lloyd Harbor, Oyster Bay, Lido Beach, Rocky Point and Amityville. Other bases were built in the city, in Westchester and Rockland counties and in northern New Jersey. The ring of missile bases was the area's last line of defense against Soviet bombers.</p>
        <p>There are few people around who remember the sight of missiles being carted across Long Island on trailers, and most of the bases have little more than a rusted chain-link fence left to them. Private homes have been built on parts of the Oyster Bay and Lloyd Harbor missile sites, and part of the Lido Beach site is now used for school bus parking by the Long Beach School District.</p>
        <p>But now, a quarter century since the last base was closed, there are hopes that the missile site at Rocky Point can be placed on the National Register of Historic Places and someday turned into a cold war museum.</p>
        <p>''A lot of cold war infrastructure is historically significant even though it's not very old,'' said Donald Bender, a military historian who researches Nike missile sites across the country for government agencies and who has started the process for historic designation. ''These missile sites aren't pretty like the old seaside fortifications that were built in previous centuries, but they're fascinating nonetheless.''</p>
        <p>Instead of stately stone forts, they are steel and concrete bunkers buried in the ground and surrounded by barbed wire. Still, standing underground at Rocky Point's now-empty missile magazine, a cavernous room about 50 feet long and 60 feet wide, Mr. Bender easily conjures Strangelovian images.</p>
        <p>''They make you think of spies, James Bond, secret codes, sirens blaring, red lights flashing,'' he says, his voice echoing through the dank expanse. ''It's cold-war scary.''</p>
        <p>But for many among the hundreds of men who served on these Long Island bases, the ''missile years'' are remembered as their best years in uniform.</p>
        <p>''It was different from other assignments,'' said Frank Hess, a 78-year-old World War II veteran who worked at missile sites on Long Island for more than 10 years. ''You're with a different group. These guys worked hard and it was a job, but it was in the line of defense of your country. We put in a lot of time together.''</p>
        <p>It was the hours spent huddled underground, waiting for further orders and not knowing if the ''red status'' issued by higher-ups was real or just a drill, that bound these men in a way not easily forgotten.</p>
        <p>''I would tell the guys to take it easy and then all of a sudden, we'd get a red status and boom, it was get to the pits, hook them up and get ready to fly them,'' said Mr. Hess, who lives in the same house in College Point where he lived while serving on the missile bases. ''And you never knew if it was practice or the real thing. The rest of the time, you'd be waiting for something to happen. After a while, it just gets in your blood.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hess joined the Army National Guard in 1955 and initially served at anti-aircraft gun batteries in Queens before moving on to missile bases on Long Island. The missile bases were initially staffed by the regular Army but by the 1960's had been shifted to the National Guard, which generally operated each base with about 90 full-time guardsmen and 40 or more weekend reservists.</p>
        <p>Each of the Long Island bases had a launch area where the missiles were kept and about half a mile away a separate radar area that searched the skies for enemy aircraft. Each base had three missile magazines or ''pits.'' Each pit held 10 Ajax missiles, lined up side by side. The Ajax, the first generation of the Nike missile, could fly 1,600 miles per hour, reached altitudes of 70,000 feet and had a conventional warhead and a range of about 25 miles.</p>
        <p>''All these things were obsolete the day they were put into practice,'' said Harold Borodiansky, who worked at four of Long Island's missile sites between 1957 and 1974. ''We knew they were obsolete, but we knew the government was always working on perfecting something new that would be bigger or faster.''</p>
        <p>The Nike Hercules missile was introduced in 1963 and because it was bigger and had a wider range, three of Long Island's missile sites were closed when it replaced the Ajax, leaving only the Rocky Point and Amityville sites through the 1960's and into the 1970's.</p>
        <p>The Hercules missile looked like and was operated like the Ajax, but it  could fly faster, higher and farther. But most important, the Hercules carried a nuclear warhead.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bender, the historian, said the nuclear missiles were designed to knock down a formation of enemy planes with one shot. Military commanders believed that because the atomic blast would take place at altitudes of 50,000 feet or higher, there would be relatively little effect on anybody on the ground.</p>
        <p>Nuclear warheads also pushed the missile sites into top-secret status.</p>
        <p>Soldiers were forbidden to talk about what they did on the Nike bases and were told to tell the curious only that they were military ''maintenance men.'' Frank Polis, the battery commander at Rocky Point from 1965 until the base was closed in 1971, said he told no one that the base had nuclear warheads, not even his wife. ''My wife used to say to me, 'I see you working in your office, but I have no idea what you do,' '' he said.</p>
        <p>Security was maximized. A second electrified fence went up to surround the missile magazines and guard dogs were brought in to patrol between the fences at night. No one was allowed near a missile alone and the notion that every action on the base had to be a two-man operation was amplified. The fire panel operator, who handled the controls that raised the missiles, could not begin until a section chief unlocked the panel with his keys.</p>
        <p>And the codes that authorized the base to fire its missiles were kept in a safe with two combinations, one kept by a captain from the radar area and the other by a technician from the launch area.</p>
        <p>But even though the nuclear warheads were a classified secret, it would not have taken much for an inquiring civilian to figure it out. When the bases held Ajax missiles, tours were regularly conducted as a goodwill gesture to the bases' neighbors.</p>
        <p>Boy Scout troops were given rides on the elevators that hoisted the missiles above ground and it was not uncommon to see an Ajax missile in a July 4th parade. But after the Hercules arrived, the parades stopped and outsiders weren't allowed past the fence.</p>
        <p>''People knew it was a missile base, there was no hiding that because you could see the missiles from the road when we put them up on their launchers,'' said Mr. Borodiansky, 62, who retired to Arizona in 1974 after suffering a back injury while rushing down an escape hatch to help disarm a missile that had accidentally armed itself.</p>
        <p>''But people didn't ask questions,'' he said. ''We were all kind of worried about the Russians and I got the impression that most of the time, they were just glad we were there. But glad in silence.''</p>
        <p>Sister Margaret Clines, 69, who taught at the Queen of the Rosary Academy, a girls' high school within sight of the Amityville missile base, said that seeing the missiles raised regularly for drills ''was a scary thing.''</p>
        <p>Even so, she said, ''I don't remember there being any great curiosity about the base. We never really knew why it was there. It was just the government put it there.''</p>
        <p>Even through the tumultuous late 1960's, when anti-war protesters filled the streets, no one ever objected to the Nike bases. Mr. Hess remembers that neighbors occasionally would voice concerns about where the enormous booster rockets would land if the missiles had to be fired.</p>
        <p>''My boosters would have landed in the Long Island Sound,'' Mr. Hess said. ''But I would say, 'If an attack comes, I don't give a damn where the booster lands because a bomb's going to be coming down otherwise.'  That's how I explained it to people.''</p>
        <p>Through the years, the missile bases and the men who worked on them tried hard to be good neighbors. Mr. Borodiansky, the platoon leader in Amityville, remembers acting quickly when the Mother Superior at the Sisters of St. Dominic complained that his men could be seen walking around the base in their underwear. ''There were also meeting places along the fence for the girls from the school and some of our young guys, which the Mother Superior really frowned on,'' he said. ''I did a lot of night reconnaissance to put a stop to that.''</p>
        <p>The men who signed up to work on a Nike missile site for the National Guard tended to be former military men who saw the assignment as a chance to settle down in one place as a civilian while still working for a branch of the armed forces. Pay was decent -- with an average salary of about $85 a week in 1960, most of the men earned enough to buy a house on suburban Long Island. Most of the time, the men worked regular 8- to 12-hour shifts running maintenance checks on the missiles and equipment and then went home to their families.</p>
        <p>But one week out of every month, each base was placed on an alert, known as alpha status. A certain number of bases in the New York region were always on alpha status in case Russian bombers flew into their airspace. While on alert, the crews would alternate 24 hours on and 24 hours off and they would sleep in barracks at the base because they could not be more than two minutes away from their battle stations.</p>
        <p>Some days would pass uneventfully. There was a game room with a television, pool table and ping pong. At Rocky Point, there was even an outdoor swimming pool.</p>
        <p>Other times would be more stressful, with drills called in the middle of the night and army intelligence officers mounting mock commando raids on the bases to keep the men on their toes. Occasionally, if an unidentified plane strayed into the area or an incident had occurred somewhere else in the region, a unit could be placed on ''yellow status'' and crews would have to stay in their pits for as long as 20 hours, ready to fire at a moment's notice. General alerts were also called at times of national crisis like the Cuban missile crisis and the assassination of President Kennedy.</p>
        <p>''The discipline that you learned from having to be on alert and being constantly evaluated stayed with you,'' said James F. Olsakovsky, 59, a commander at Rocky Point and Amityville who now lives near Albany and retired as a colonel in 1996. ''You could lose a whole evaluation if just one person didn't do his job, so everybody depended on everybody to do their job and to do it well.''</p>
        <p>Once a year, each crew would head to New Mexico to fire missiles at simulated targets. In addition to those evaluations, the men who worked on the 250 Nike missile sites scattered across the country also faced constant safety inspections and security checks at their home bases. The Rocky Point site earned a reputation as one of the best in the nation, winning three awards for ''excellence in combat proficiency'' and a listing as one of the nation's top five missile batteries.</p>
        <p>But in all the years that missiles were kept on Long Island, the men who worked on the bases said they never really felt a serious threat to the area or thought that they might actually have to fire the missiles.</p>
        <p>''The biggest threat we had had nothing to do with the enemy,'' recalled Mr. Polis, 62, the Rocky Point commander who also lives near Albany. He recalled that during the 1965 blackout that darkened most of the Northeast, he and his men feared the worst when in addition to being plunged into darkness, one of their sentry dogs suddenly turned up dead.</p>
        <p>''That was a very deep-thought day,'' he said. ''I was thinking about Pearl Harbor and how they saw signs that something was happening.''</p>
        <p>No one on the base breathed easy until a local veterinarian came to the base and autopsied the dog to discover that it had died of natural causes.</p>
        <p>The Rocky Point site closed in 1971 and the Amityville site closed in 1974. Both bases are now used by the Army Reserve. The massive elevator doors on the missile pits have been welded shut and most of the buildings from the Nike days have either been demolished or sit abandoned and empty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Polis said he and his colleagues would be delighted to see the old Rocky Point site turned into a cold war museum. ''Very little is known about what went on in the days of the cold war,'' he said. ''Hollywood does war movies, but the cold war wasn't exciting enough, I guess. Nobody really knows what was going on on the home front.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bender said that getting historic designation would be just the first step toward preserving the missile site. ''It gives it a certain status that would help potentially get funding to turn it into a museum or to get volunteers interested,'' he said. A missile site in the San Francisco area has been restored as a museum and is run entirely by volunteers, most of them missile site veterans. It attracts about 20,000 visitors a year.</p>
        <p>Chet Marcus, a spokesman for the 77th Army Regional Support Command, which oversees the Rocky Point base, said that the Army Reserve would support restoration plans. He said that the missile magazines were ''40 percent ready to be brought back to life,'' noting that while the steel racks that held the missiles and the missile control panels had been carted off, much of the infrastructure remained, including fuse boxes and controls for the missile elevators.</p>
        <p>Pacifists aren't that crazy about the idea of a cold war museum.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I'd want to see that,'' said the Rev. Robert Lepley, executive director of the Long Island Alliance for Peaceful Alternatives. ''It was such an irresponsible thing to place nuclear weapons on an island when these things are so accident-prone, and a museum would probably give it a positive spin.''</p>
        <p>But Josh Stoff, the curator at the Cradle of Aviation Museum, which will open next spring with a Nike Hercules missile, lauded the idea of preserving the missile site.</p>
        <p>''People on Long Island now have no idea that during the cold war, Long Island was ground zero and we were protecting New York and the whole East Coast,'' he said. ''It's not about glorifying war, it's about remembering the cold war and how fear of attack was a social phenomenon that everyone experienced.''</p>
