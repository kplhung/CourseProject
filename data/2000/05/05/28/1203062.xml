        <p>WHEN it comes to Dean &amp; DeLuca, the Soho retailer of fine food and gorgeous kitchenware, New Yorkers are happy to spend $15 for a pound of rugelach or $2 for an Asian pear.</p>
        <p>But will investors prove as eager to put money into Dean &amp; DeLuca stock when the company offers shares in its initial public offering, expected in five to six weeks?</p>
        <p>As of Friday, Dean &amp; DeLuca -- which hasn't turned a profit in seven years -- had not set a price for the offering, nor had it announced how many shares it would sell. But the company hopes to raise about $69 million to finance a major expansion.</p>
        <p>One of the first things an investor is likely to glean from the prospectus is that Joel B. Dean and Giorgio G. DeLuca, the company's founders, are no longer minding the store. Leslie G. Rudd, who holds 64 percent of Dean &amp; DeLuca's shares, has been chairman since September 1995. And while Dean &amp; DeLuca's flagship venue on lower Broadway remains one of Manhattan's culinary temples, the company has been opening stores nationwide for the past decade, and channeling money into its catalog and Internet businesses.</p>
        <p>Today, Dean &amp; DeLuca operates four other stores, in Washington; Charlotte, N.C.; Leawood, Kan. (a suburb of Kansas City); and St. Helena, Calif.</p>
        <p>The company wants to open one or two specialty stores next year, and three or four stores in each of the five years thereafter.</p>
        <p>Dean &amp; DeLuca's expansion has not come cheaply. The company has not been profitable since the end of February 1993, a fact that must leave purchasers of Dean &amp; DeLuca's $5 horned melons scratching their heads. And because of its expansion plans, the company expects to report sizable losses for the foreseeable future.</p>
        <p>Last year, it lost $8.9 million on sales of $59.6 million, compared with a loss of $5.7 million on sales of $49.3 million in 1998, and a loss of $9.3 million on sales of $34.4 million in 1997. As of Jan. 30, it had $17.1 million in cash. Total debt stood at $3.2 million.</p>
        <p>Still, the market for specialty foods -- Dean &amp; DeLuca's largest business -- is growing, as is demand for premium-priced wine and upscale kitchenware. The prospectus forecasts United States sales of specialty foods alone to reach $54 billion by 2002, up from about $38.8 billion in 1997. And Forrester Research, a market research firm in Cambridge, Mass., estimates that sales of specialty foods online will rise from $248 million in 1999, to $6.3 billion in 2003.</p>
        <p>So the company's expansion makes sense, industry analysts say. ''Specialty food customers are the best food customers,'' said Phil Lempert, the editor of the Lempert Report, a newsletter in Santa Monica.</p>
        <p>But competition is increasing. The Internet gives consumers access to the Web sites of food manufacturers, not just retailers. Evie Black Dykema, a Forrester analyst, cautions that online grocers like Webvan Group and general retailers like Amazon.com are expanding their specialty food offerings, too.</p>
        <p>Others, like Ron Paul, president of Technomic Inc., a Chicago consulting firm, question whether it makes sense for a specialty food store to open so many outlets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lempert, for one, isn't surprised by Dean &amp; DeLuca's losses. He thinks the future of specialty food retailing lies in companies either creating strong, content-filled Internet sites that keep customers coming back for more products, like Amazon, or building 40,000-square-foot superstores that can generate high sales. Dean &amp; DeLuca's new outlets will average just 10,000 to 15,000 square feet.</p>
        <p>And like a number of other food analysts, Mr. Lempert thinks the retailer's Web site needs a makeover. Dean &amp; DeLuca is planning such an overhaul, according to the prospectus. It also plans to use its catalogs to promote its Internet business more vigorously by sending out about 13 million this year, compared with 4 million in 1999.</p>
        <p>Still, the climate for new issues is tepid. And according to Steven Tuen, director for research at IPO Value Monitor, a research firm in New York, food-related initial offerings historically have not fared well, with many eventually sinking below their offering prices.</p>
