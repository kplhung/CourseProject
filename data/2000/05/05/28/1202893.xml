        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Midge Mackenzie, in ''An Antiwar Message From the Army's Messenger'' [April 16], writes that John Huston's ''San Pietro''  ''stands alone in the history of documentary filmmaking . . . it is the only complete record of an infantry battle. . . . It is a vivid, complete record of the brutal combat conditions that faced the 143rd Infantry Regiment of Texas as it battled to liberate the hill town of San Pietro.''</p>
        <p>It is hard to believe that Ms. Mackenzie would not be familiar with the work of Prof. Lance Bertelsen of the University of Texas, titled ''San Pietro and the 'Art' of War,'' which appeared in the Southwest Review in 1989. Or that she would not have consulted the many hours of unedited film from which Huston worked, which remain in the National Archives for any who wish to study the art of his filmmaking.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Midge Mackenzie, in ''An Antiwar Message From the Army's Messenger'' [April 16], writes that John Huston's ''San Pietro''  ''stands alone in the history of documentary filmmaking . . . it is the only complete record of an infantry battle. . . . It is a vivid, complete record of the brutal combat conditions that faced the 143rd Infantry Regiment of Texas as it battled to liberate the hill town of San Pietro.''</p>
        <p>It is hard to believe that Ms. Mackenzie would not be familiar with the work of Prof. Lance Bertelsen of the University of Texas, titled ''San Pietro and the 'Art' of War,'' which appeared in the Southwest Review in 1989. Or that she would not have consulted the many hours of unedited film from which Huston worked, which remain in the National Archives for any who wish to study the art of his filmmaking.</p>
        <p>Professor Bertelsen analyzed every foot of Huston's film and compared it with the unedited footage in the archive. His conclusion: that ''the bulk of action in the film . . . was restaged between late December and late February using troops from the 36th Division (and possibly other units).'' This is consistent with the fact that Huston only arrived in the Liri Valley on Dec. 16, the final day of the battle.</p>
        <p>Professor Bertelsen found the officer, Capt. Joel Westbrook, who had been assigned to facilitate Huston's filming. Captain Westbrook ''recalls that he and Huston would go over maps together, with Westbrook describing parts of the battle and Huston asking if they could be recreated.''</p>
        <p>''Huston would then be assigned troops, and moved to the designated area,'' Professor Bertelsen wrote. ''Westbrook recalls making sure that the troops throwing hand grenades were given relatively safe concussion grenades rather than the fragmentation type; indeed, in several of the outtakes we can see small explosive charges being tossed in front of troops to simulate enemy shelling. (In the final version of the film, only the subsequent explosion and troop reaction appear.)''</p>
        <p>Does knowing that ''San Pietro'' was not filmed during the battle, as Ms. Mackenzie says, but restaged afterward, degrade its authenticity? According to Professor Bertelsen it does not. He found that Captain Westbrook, who fought in the battle, felt that the film was an essentially accurate rendition of the fighting.</p>
        <p>Huston recreated history to celebrate the humanity and courage of the young men he found at San Pietro and to elevate the human spirit everywhere, which makes ''San Pietro'' a work of art -- a pastoral elegy, Professor Bertelsen suggests -- rather than a documentary film.</p>
