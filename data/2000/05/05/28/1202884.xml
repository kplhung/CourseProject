        <p>IF clutter fills your counters, scum lines your sink and dust balls dance beneath your sofa, you are not alone. But Robin Kotz, president of Maid Brigade, says there is no need for the house-cleaning impaired to despair. She offered advice based on what she has learned running a housecleaning service that cleans more than 50 houses a day.</p>
        <p>''The longest it took us to clean one small-size house was a day and a half,'' said Ms. Kotz, whose business has offices in Pleasantville and Greenwich. ''It looked like it hadn't been cleaned for months! There were dirty dishes stacked in the sink, on the counters, on the floor and in the oven. There was a bowl so stuck to a plate that even after hours of soaking, we couldn't get it off!''</p>

        <p>IF clutter fills your counters, scum lines your sink and dust balls dance beneath your sofa, you are not alone. But Robin Kotz, president of Maid Brigade, says there is no need for the house-cleaning impaired to despair. She offered advice based on what she has learned running a housecleaning service that cleans more than 50 houses a day.</p>
        <p>''The longest it took us to clean one small-size house was a day and a half,'' said Ms. Kotz, whose business has offices in Pleasantville and Greenwich. ''It looked like it hadn't been cleaned for months! There were dirty dishes stacked in the sink, on the counters, on the floor and in the oven. There was a bowl so stuck to a plate that even after hours of soaking, we couldn't get it off!''</p>
        <p>The key to daily cleaning tasks, she said, is to maintain order and tidiness while going through the day. Taking a few minutes at a time, she said, eliminates larger, more ominous tasks that can build up from neglect. ''Make your bed every morning,'' she urged. ''And put your clothes away at the end of the day. It doesn't take more than a few minutes, but it certainly beats having to sort through piles of clothes strewn about at the end of the week.''</p>
        <p>The same premise applies to the kitchen and bathrooms. ''Run the dishwasher and empty the trash every evening,'' she said, adding that a sponge can be disinfected by popping it in the dishwasher with the dishes every night. ''Wipe down your kitchen table, counter and sinks. If you wait, what's easy now will harden or get sticky and become a much bigger job to clean up later.''</p>
        <p>''Keep a squeegee with your shampoo and use it after every shower,'' she said. ''This way, you won't need to use harsh chemicals to remove buildup, and it's one less thing you'll have to do during your weekly cleanings.''</p>
        <p>When it comes to overall neatness, Ms. Kotz follows the touch-things-once principle: ''Decide where something goes and put it there -- file it, put it in a cabinet, throw it away.  Whether it's mail, new purchases or an old sweater, don't just leave it around till later; put it away now.''</p>
        <p>Whether you do it yourself or hire a cleaning person weekly (or biweekly), cleaning involves larger, more time-consuming tasks, Ms. Kotz said, like cleaning everything in the bathroom and kitchen and vacuuming floors, carpets and upholstery. Also change linens, wash floors and check for cobwebs and dust baseboards, moldings, windowsills and lampshades. Look for fingerprints on light switches and doorknobs and wipe away smudges on mirrors and sliding-glass doors.</p>
        <p>''Set aside an undisturbed block of time for your weekly cleaning,'' she advised, ''and have all your supplies at your fingertips.'' She recommends a portable caddie stocked with cleansers, a disinfectant, furniture polish and cleaning tools like a scrub brush, a toilet brush, a grout brush, scrub pads and a cotton cloth, an extendible duster and all the vacuum cleaner attachments. ''If you've left the disinfectant under the kitchen sink and you're upstairs cleaning your bathroom, you'll probably not bother going to get it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>There's method to this madness, she believes. ''With respect to the law of gravity, dust before you vacuum,'' she said. ''Clean each room completely and then move on.'' She suggests working from the top to the bottom of a house, and from left to right around each room. ''Don't waste steps!'' she said. If the work is being divided between two people, one can do the wet work, like bathrooms and kitchen, while the other does the dry work, including vacuuming and dusting.</p>
        <p>As for dusting, Ms. Kotz advises: ''Pick an item up, dust the surface underneath it, then dust the item -- not over the clean surface, of course -- and replace it. Don't slide items -- you can scratch the surface underneath.''</p>
        <p>''Remember: cleaning is very physical work,'' she added. ''Bend at the knees, and for added comfort, use a knee pad when you're down on the floor.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Kotz believes that it's essential to be informed and prepared when it comes to supplies and tools -- bleach, for instance. ''We've stopped using bleach altogether,'' she said. Not only are its fumes unhealthy to breathe, she said, but it's bad for some surfaces. ''It eats through marble, which is porous, and forget it if you spill it on the rug or splash it on your clothing.'' Instead, she recommends non-toxic cleaning products whenever possible.</p>
        <p>She stressed the importance of reading the directions on products. ''Make sure what you're using is appropriate,'' she said, citing Murphy Oil Soap as an example. ''It's for wood floors, but in most homes, the wood floors are coated with polyurethane, and Murphy Oil Soap will leave a residue that will eventually dull the finish.'' She suggests instead a product designed specifically for polyurethaned floors, called PolyCare, which is manufactured in Westchester and available in some hardware stores. ''Of course,'' she added, ''you don't mop waxed floors -- and everyone knows you can't mix bleach and ammonia.'' Of course.</p>
        <p>The mop is another subject dear to Ms. Kotz's heart. ''You have your mop and your bucket,'' she said, ''and the more you rinse the mop, the dirtier the water in the bucket gets. Soon, you're mopping with dirty water.''</p>
        <p>An alternative, she suggests, is a mop designed with removable terry cloth mitts, which fit over the end.  ''This way,'' she explains, ''you just wet the mitt in the sink before you begin. When it gets dirty, you can flip it over. You can use different products with the same mop by changing the mitt, or if you want to dry a surface, you put on a dry mitt.  There's no need for a bucket at all.''</p>
        <p>Up there with such easy-to-overlook things as window blinds, the tracks for patio and shower doors and the bottom of the silverware holder in a dish drainer are the vents at the bottom of the refrigerator.  ''And don't forget all that food that slides underneath,'' she said. Happily, she observed, there's a tool designed for that purpose, with an extendible brush for easy reaching.</p>
        <p>For those attuned, there's a special feeling that comes with a freshly cleaned house -- a calm that pervades when surfaces are cleared and floors are newly mopped, a quietness that settles when all is resting peacefully in its place.</p>
        <p>As Nina Doran of Mount Kisco put it: ''When my house has been cleaned, when everything is tidy and sparkling, it makes me feel there's some order and control in my life, even if there really isn't. When my house is clean, for a day anyway, I feel like everything else can continue -- for that short while, it feels like anything is possible.''</p>
