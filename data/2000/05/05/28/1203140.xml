        <p>Every night, the people with no roofs to sleep under sit on the benches along downtown Pacific Avenue. They wait until the neon signs in the pubs go dark and the stream of cars cruising down the street becomes a trickle. Then they take their nighttime places.</p>
        <p>Maybe up against a doorway or behind the Safeway supermarket trash bins, or, after a bit of a hike, in the woods, deep enough so that the unleashed dogs won't sniff them out.</p>
        <p>Figuring out where to sleep, an old-timer named Daryl said the other day, is hard work. Not only must you be up and out by dawn. ''Where you start out,'' he said, ''isn't necessarily where you end up the next day.''</p>
        <p>That's because like so many cities all over the country, Santa Cruz bans sleeping on the streets -- or, in fact, in cars, in parks, under trees. But the police let the sleepers alone unless someone complains. Still, spend a few days in one spot, Daryl said, and the complaints come.</p>
        <p>But now Santa Cruz is defying the national trend in moving homeless people out of public places. The City Council has voted to create ''safe sleeping zones'' for homeless people in two industrial parks. The sleeping zones, where people could sleep in their vehicles or on the ground with their blankets or sleeping bags, will have trash bins, portable toilets and a police officer dedicated to patrolling those areas.</p>
        <p>The City Council passed the measure on Tuesday on a preliminary vote of 4 to 2 (with one member absent), and is expected to pass it on a final vote in two weeks. The measure will take effect on a trial run in mid-July, the height of this beach-and-boardwalk town's tourist season. In November, city residents will vote on a ballot measure that seeks to make the zones permanent.</p>
        <p>The measure, proposed by Mayor Keith A. Sugar after intense public pressure from a group that has been trying to have the sleeping ban lifted for years (most recently by waging a five-month hunger strike), comes with some restrictions. It would allow people to sleep in the zones between 9 p.m. and 7 a.m. Structures, tents, or other camping accessories like stoves would continue to be illegal. People would not be allowed within 300 feet of any home. And after three nights in any one spot, they would have to move to another spot at least 500 feet away.</p>
        <p>Other cities, including Berkeley, Calif., and Eugene, Ore., have also tried to designate sleeping zones, only to abandon their efforts when the zones became unmanageable. But Santa Cruz, Mayor Sugar said, will be different.</p>
        <p>''This is not a situation where people can come from out of town and bed down,'' Mr. Sugar told skeptics after the vote. ''It will give the homeless a place to go.''</p>
        <p>Others are not so sure. Councilman Michael E. Rotkin, a self-described ''socialist-feminist'' who was absent for the vote but would have voted no, said the measure would only undermine support for homeless people. ''I've knocked on three-quarters of the doors in Santa Cruz,'' he said, ''and the single biggest issue that people bring up spontaneously is, what are you going to do about all the bums on the streets? And these are political progressives.''</p>
        <p>Santa Cruz, which is at least as politically left-wing as Berkeley, has agonized over its public sleeping ban for years. Time and again the City Council has discussed the idea of softening the law. Each time, people have objected. Business owners complained that customers would be scared off by panhandlers or drug users or the merely truly needy, tattered and torn. Others wondered whether legalizing public sleeping would make Santa Cruz one big camping ground.</p>
        <p>Still others objected on philosophical grounds. Shouldn't Santa Cruz be helping these people off the streets rather than helping them stay on them?</p>
        <p>The city, with 52,000 residents, offers an array of services for its homeless population of 750 to 1,500, including a center with free showers, meals, voice mail and lockers, as well as schools for homeless children. A number of churches and other nonprofit organizations also provide services.</p>
        <p>But the city lacks shelter beds.  Robert Norse, a proponent of ending the sleeping ban, said that recent studies showed that homeless people are 4 to 12 times more likely than housed people to be the victims of attacks. The sleeping ban puts the homeless ''physically in peril,'' and ''throws all law into disrespect,'' he said, because it means that the homeless are encouraged to break laws in order to sleep at night.</p>
        <p>The measure to ease the ban, proponents say, will also clear the homeless people out of downtown, making it easier on the tourists.</p>
        <p>But summer seems to have a way of doing that too. The tourists on their long Memorial Day weekend were out in force on Pacific Avenue on Friday night, spilling out of the bars and hanging out on the benches, and for some reason no one could say, there was not a homeless person to be found.</p>
