        <p>A newly dynamic midfield and an economical approach on offense were elixirs tonight for the MetroStars.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars, yes, the MetroStars, scored three unanswered goals -- two less than a minute apart -- in the first half on a paltry four shots on goal to defeat the Chicago Fire, 4-1, at Giants Stadium in front of 41,609 fans.</p>
        <p>The Fire, the 1998 Major League Soccer champion in its inaugural season, came into the match as the league's top-scoring team (28 goals) and boasted the leading scorer, the American striker Ante Razov.</p>
        <p>After peppering MetroStars goalkeeper Mike Ammann with 29 shots, 15 on goal (14 on goal in the first half), all the Fire could muster was Razov's goal on a penalty kick in the 71st minute, his 11th goal of the season.</p>
        <p>Chicago (6-6-1), with the Bulgarian international Hristo Stoitchkov on as a substitute in the second half, monopolized the ball, but the MetroStars (5-6) refused to buckle as Ammann played perhaps his strongest game in goal since joining the club last season from Kansas City.</p>
        <p>As most of the players were still trying to find their rhythm, the MetroStars seized a 1-0 lead in the fourth minute on Mark Chung's left-footed side volley from 12 yards out. Clint Mathis, one of the new faces in the MetroStars' midfield, started the play by tapping the ball to Roy Myers, another recent addition. Myers's cross found Chung, who had slipped by Chicago's Jesse Marsch, on the left side.</p>
        <p>''Clint and Roy make great runs off the ball and that opens it up for everyone,'' Chung said. ''The midfield is looking sharp right now.''</p>
        <p>Chicago came close in the 16th minute when a shot by Dema Kovalenko was cleared off the line by MetroStars defender Mark Semioli. Razov's shot off the clearance sailed wide.</p>
        <p>The MetroStars took a 2-0 lead in the 34th minute when Chung's corner kick from the left flank was struck by defender Steve Jolley on the full volley. Chicago goalie Zack Thornton parried the ball, but into the top of his net. Less than a minute later, Adolfo Valencia passed to Myers on the right. Myers dribbled to the end line and crossed to Mathis, who tucked a 4-yard shot between Thornton and the near post.</p>
        <p>''Roy, Clint, Chung and Tab played well in the midfield,'' MetroStars Coach Octavio Zambrano said. ''That's the kind of team I like to coach. We created our own opportunities.</p>
        <p>''The idea here is to get good players and let them play.''</p>
        <p>Zambrano, reluctantly he said, got involved on the field near the end of the game. A hard foul against the MetroStars' Mike Petke ignited a round of pushing and shoving that led to the ejections of Razov and Zambrano. Yellow cards were issued to Daniel Hernandez of the MetroStars and Josh Wolff of Chicago.</p>
        <p>''It was a blemish on a good victory,'' Zambrano said. ''I was trying to pull people away, we were arguing and I got hit in the face. I made a mistake by retaliating. It was a mistake and I apologize.''</p>
        <p>CORNER KICKS</p>
        <p>Defender MIKE PETKE, the only MetroStars field player to play every minute (910) of the first 10 games this season, did not start against Chicago. He did come on for midfielder TAB RAMOS to bolster the defense in the second half. . . . The MetroStars' TOM DOOLEY missed the game with a groin strain. . . . PETTER VILLEGAS, who scored the MetroStars' winning goal last week against Tampa Bay, left the game in the 27th minute with back spasms. He was replaced by RAMIRO CORRALES, who was back in action after serving a one-game suspension after getting a red card in Kansas City two weeks ago. . . . The national teams of Jamaica and Colombia played the second game of Saturday night's doubleheader. Each team is involved in qualifying games for the 2002 World Cup, with Colombia playing against Venezuela next weekend.</p>
