        <p>THE COUNTESS,'' a drama about a sensational sex scandal involving three prominent Victorians -- John Ruskin, the most famous art critic of his day; John Everett Millais, Ruskin's protege and an artist who would later gain his own fame, and Euphemia Gray, the beautiful Scotswoman who came between them -- has quietly defied theatrical convention. With little fanfare and limited financing it has become the longest-running new drama of the 1999-2000 season and is now ensconced at an Off Broadway theater four times the size of the one where it started.</p>
        <p>Written by an aspiring New York novelist, produced and directed by a former English actress who mortgaged her theater to keep it going and supported by Millais descendants eager to finally realize the vain efforts of their ancestors to clear their great-great-grandmother's name, the play, at the Lamb's Theater, has become a cause in more ways than one.</p>
        <p>This year is the centenary of Ruskin's death at the age of 80. A demigod in the mid-19th century who dictated artistic opinion in England, he is still an object of veneration, and thus the play is causing consternation among devotees loath to see the details of his unhappy marriage revealed.</p>
        <p>Interest in Ruskin and his era is evident in the current celebrated show at the Tate Gallery in London about the work of Ruskin and the Pre-Raphaelite painters, a movement that Millais helped found and that Ruskin championed. An exhibit of Ruskiniana at the Grolier Club in New York ended last month. In September, the Morgan Library will open its own collection of original Ruskin manuscripts along with correspondence known as the Bowerswell Papers -- 100 years of letters by Ruskin, Millais and Euphemia, or Effie, and their families and friends. A new edition of Ruskin's ''Stones of Venice,'' his third major volume of criticism, has been published, as has the two-volume biography ''John Ruskin'' by Tim Hilton.</p>
        <p>''The Countess,'' based on historical fact, begins in 1853 as Ruskin, who had married Effie in 1848, when he was 29 and she 19, prepares for a trip with his wife and Millais to the Scottish Highlands. Millais is to paint the critic's portrait. But in their small cottage, Ruskin indulges in his perverse habit of compromising his wife by leaving her alone with Millais. The painter becomes blocked about the portrait and instead sketches Effie. He is disturbed by Ruskin, a man who can bring audiences to their feet with his resounding exhortations that ''beauty is in the ordinary, the raw truth of life,'' but at home demeans Effie, writing down her faults in his journal to read to his parents, who dominated the marriage, and finally making Effie believe she was going mad. Eventually, all that Millais understood was that he was falling in love with his mentor's wife. What he did not yet know was that the Ruskins had never consummated their marriage.</p>
        <p>On his wedding night, it is possible that Ruskin expected to gaze upon the embodiment of a marble statue, but when he slipped off the nightgown of his young wife, he was aghast to see the woman beneath. ''Though her face is beautiful . . . there were certain circumstances in her person which completely checked passion,'' Ruskin later stated in court papers involving his marriage annulment. No one, perhaps including Ruskin himself, knew why. That he was overly fascinated by young girls in the way that another Victorian author, Lewis Carroll, was, is known.</p>
        <p>The play ends as the desperate Effie, back in London with Ruskin, leaves her husband in 1854. A little more than a year later she and Millais were married. They would have eight children. Ruskin never married again. In middle age he fell in love with a 10-year-old girl; her death at 24 would ultimately be a factor in the madness of his last years.</p>
        <p>Perhaps it is not surprising that scholars have tended to sweep this material into biographical afterthought, for in his time, Ruskin's impact, his elegant interweaving of art and social theory, was so great that he influenced men like Proust, Wilde and Gandhi.</p>
        <p>''Do you know that Gandhi could not put Ruskin's book 'Unto This Last' down during a train trip across Africa and said it changed the whole course of his life?'' asked Dyke Benjamin, a member of the Grolier Club. A tall courtly man who resembles his hero in manner and eloquence, Mr. Benjamin was cradling a cream-colored book, ''Remembering John Ruskin,'' that he produced using original Scottish fonts to memorialize Ruskin's most indelible phrases. The book served as the catalog for the Grolier exhibit, which included Mr. Benjamin's collection of Ruskin material. ''It is a gross injustice for this genius to be depicted as a strident, shallow misogynist in some Off Broadway play,'' Mr. Benjamin said.</p>
        <p>Gregory Murphy, the author of ''The Countess'' -- the title comes from Millais's nickname for Effie -- came upon the story in the book ''Parallel Lives: Five Victorian Marriages'' by Phyllis Rose.</p>
        <p>''It was so fascinating,'' said Mr. Murphy, who is 48. ''Here was a man who talked about beauty and art, who married this incredibly beautiful woman, and then set about trying to destroy her. It's about the difference between the ideal and reality. I was interested in finding out the truth.''</p>
        <p>He continued, ''Once I discovered that the Bowerswell Papers were at the Morgan Library, I wanted to look at them.'' Studying the more than 1,000 letters, Mr. Murphy remembered, ''I saw Effie being damaged year after year, coming to believe that she had some awful internal disease, watched her handwriting go from a sturdy Scotch script to a shaky scrawl.'' He added, ''I think Ruskin would have destroyed her without the help of Millais and Effie's confidante Lady Eastlake. Eastlake was a writer of the period who was disparaged for her feminist views. She is in my play because she was able to unlock the secret of the Ruskin marriage.</p>
        <p>''After the annulment, Effie did not marry Millais for a year but stayed at her family home in Bowerswell, Scotland. She is always described as shallow and a social climber. That is completely fictitious. Ruskin's parents described her that way. But it persists. She left Ruskin, a very wealthy and influential man, and married Millais, an artist who was then almost penniless. If she were a social climber she never would have done that. When Ruskin partisans talk about his marriage they never address the issue that Ruskin married her and then refused to sleep with her.''</p>
        <p>About five years ago, Mr. Murphy had a reading of ''The Countess,'' and one of the actors told Ludovica Villar-Hauser, who owns the small Greenwich Street Theater in the South Village, about the play. Ms. Villar-Hauser, 39, a tall, reedy Englishwoman of Spanish and Austrian descent, had directed a number of plays about women and thought Mr. Murphy's play could work.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't let it go,'' Ms. Villar-Hauser said. ''It stayed with me. I identified with the script, like many women who come to the show. I had been involved with a wonderful but very cold man. I found it just amazing that after 150 years, they are still dragging the woman down! She happened to be a very talented woman. She was a pianist and fluent in three languages, but instead of leaving her mark on the world, she was the backbone for husbands who did. Even encyclopedias dismiss her as a social climber.</p>
        <p>''It reminded me of Princess Diana, with Prince Charles under the spell of his mother, the attempts to keep Diana down and then to paint her as mad. In Victorian England, it was almost as bad to be seen to do something bad as to actually do it. I thought it time to set the record straight.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Villar-Hauser presented the seven-character play in a nonprofit showcase produced by the Villar-Hauser Theater Development Fund at her 74-seat Off Off Broadway theater in March 1999. The cast included the three actors who are currently in the principal roles: James Riordan as Ruskin, Jennifer Woodward as Effie and Jy Murphy (no relation to the playwright) as Millais. ''Our audiences were wonderful,'' the director said. ''We had people crying, asking me afterward whether Ruskin was gay or what was really wrong with Effie.'' In fact, when Effie was examined by doctors to ascertain her virginity before the annulment, they declared her ''naturally and properly formed with no impediments'' to sexual relations.</p>
        <p>''I became obsessed,'' Ms. Villar-Hauser recalled. ''We weren't filling the house. Any play has a natural death, but this one wasn't ready to die. What kept us going was the audience response and the review in The New York Times.''</p>
        <p>Writing in The Times, Anita Gates called the play a ''serious but wonderfully witty period drama'' with an ''excellent'' cast.</p>
        <p>Limited by a small advertising budget, Ms. Villar-Hauser decided to build interest by holding weekly Victorian Nights for audiences, with the cast, the creators, refreshments and a Victorian expert on hand. She commissioned and displayed in the lobby a portrait of Ms. Woodward as Effie in Pre-Raphaelite style, as well as a copy of the letter Effie wrote her father asking him to rescue her from her marriage. Volunteers worked the box office and became permanent ushers.</p>
        <p>''We had gained a kind of cult support group but it was crazy,'' Ms. Villar-Hauser said. ''I was working 24 hours a day, seven days a week as general manager, company manager, producer, director and ticket seller.'' But audiences continued to grow and on March 19, at the Samuel Beckett Theater on Theater Row, the company celebrated its 352nd performance. It had opened there in June 1999 to generally favorable reviews.</p>
        <p>When the Samuel Beckett closed in March, along with other auditoriums on Theater Row, because of construction, Ms. Villar-Hauser decided to see whether she could reopen the play as a commercial engagement: ''I hadn't had time to go out and meet the right money people, not that I even knew who or how to meet them. Nobody wanted to invest in a straight play about an obscure Victorian without pyrotechnics and dancing and car crashes. I called everyone, even people I met on a bus.''</p>
        <p>Small investments arrived and then one man pledged $250,000. This enabled ''The Countess'' to move to the Lamb's Theater on West 44th Street. But 10 days before previews were to begin in April, the large donor, hurt by a dip in the stock market, pulled out. Ms. Villar-Hauser took a loan on her Greenwich Street Theater to save the show.</p>
        <p>At the Lamb's, where the play's script is sold, she still welcomes the audience and chats during intermission. ''We are trying to create the feeling of bringing the audience into the play,'' she said. ''The energy has to go back and forth from stage to audience for this play to work.''</p>
        <p>Word of ''The Countess,'' of course, traveled to England and the descendants of Effie and Millais. ''We had been told so much about great-great-Grandma and it was so moving to see her brought to life,'' said Tara Millais in a telephone interview from London. She and her brother Joshua saw the play twice at the Samuel Beckett.</p>
        <p>''We bear no grudge toward Ruskin,'' Ms. Millais said, ''but as a family we knew the BBC documentaries and the books did not tell the truth about her. She was exiled from Queen Victoria's court for defying the ridiculous moral code that dictated that a woman must endure in silence whatever her lord and master dealt her.''</p>
        <p>Family members have become so involved in ''The Countess'' that Ms. Millais, a film producer, said she was in the beginning stages of turning the play into a British period costume movie. For his part, Joshua Millais, a portrait photographer in London, has done some of the publicity photography for the show and has spoken at several Victorian Nights.</p>
        <p>As for Ruskin, a viewer of the many letters at the Morgan, their vellum paper shimmering against the mahogany tables, can see the passionate declarations with which his marriage to Effie Gray, who was a distant cousin, began. A thrifty Scot, Effie often ''crosshatches,'' writing two pages on one by inscribing in both directions to save paper, if not the reader's eyes.</p>
        <p>BUT some letters hint at the things that would inevitably divide them. Writes Ruskin, in his thick tight script: ''My own Effie, my mistress, my friend, my queen, my darling, my only love . . . I can't answer you a word today. I am going into town with my mother.''</p>
        <p>At a recent Grolier Club dinner celebrating Ruskin, Robert Parks, the curator of the Bowerswell Papers at the Morgan, spoke about the marriage. His listeners, a group of cosmopolitan rare-book collectors, digging into plates of roast lamb, seemed to agree among themselves that it was unfair to ''diminish'' the reputation of an unusually complicated man, even if his life directly contradicted his work.</p>
        <p>''What many people don't realize,'' said Mr. Benjamin, who was present, ''is that Ruskin supported many girls' schools and had very deep friendships with women -- among them Kate Greenaway,'' the artist and illustrator. ''He championed Kate Greenaway's art and she was in love with him. He rejected her because she was frankly not very pretty.''</p>
        <p>Ruskin also asked her to send him her illustrations of little girls stripped of their clothes. She ignored him.</p>
        <p>As the Grolier evening ended, Mr. Benjamin expressed satisfaction with at least one development. ''During the exhibition of my Ruskin collection in April, one day there suddenly appeared little brochures on a table for 'The Countess.' And apparently at the theater, there were fliers for my exhibition. I registered a mild complaint to the club management and I don't know what transpired. All I know is that after that, I never saw any more brochures.''</p>
