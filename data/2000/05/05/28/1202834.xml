        <p>The historian Stephen E. Ambrose is not the first writer to devote much of his career to a war. But Dr. Ambrose, the author of ''D-Day, June 6, 1944: the Climactic Battle of World War II,'' may be the first to found a museum devoted to an amphibious invasion.</p>
        <p>The National D-Day Museum will open next month in a 19th-century former brewery and an adjoining four-story glass-fronted pavilion in the Warehouse District of downtown New Orleans.</p>
        <p>New Orleans was the home of Higgins Industries, which built landing craft that carried infantry platoons through rough seas from ships to shore, allowing men and equipment to land on open beaches, as they did in Normandy.</p>
        <p>Among the displays in the 70,500-square-foot museum will be a reproduction of the boat designed by Andrew Higgins, the company owner, whom General Eisenhower, in a conversation with Dr. Ambrose, credited with winning the war. A section of the street that the museum fronts, Howard Avenue, will be renamed Andrew Higgins Street.</p>
        <p>Other exhibits will include film footage of the invasion at Normandy and battle artifacts from the beaches, a vintage glider that is part of a scene recreating a crash in a Normandy field, and a simulated hedgerow to show why combat beyond the shore was so difficult. Nine oral history stations will recount a variety of personal experiences.</p>
        <p>The National D-Day Museum, 945 Magazine Street at the corner of Howard Avenue, (504) 527-6012, was developed at a cost of $25 million, a mix of federal, state and private funds. Dr. Ambrose conceived of the project and played a major role in the museum's fund-raising. In 2001 the museum plans to open a section focusing on the war's other D-Days, the Pacific invasions.</p>
        <p>From June 2 to 9, the museum will be open only for those holding preview tickets sold through the mail; it expects to open its doors to walk-in visitors on June 10.</p>
        <p>Hours are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily. Tickets cost $7, $5 for ages 5 to 17.</p>
