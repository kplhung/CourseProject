        <p>Psychotherapist Henry M Seiden letter on May 7 special issue holds panel of psychotherapists should not have been trying to intone social truths</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>I'm a psychotherapist myself, and I think that your panel went for some very old bait. The world wants to see us as fountains of wise observation. But we're not. As soon as we start trying to intone Social Truth we sound foolish.</p>
        <p>Good therapists need to guard against assuming that we know what we are going to hear -- quite the opposite of the task your panel was asked to undertake. We try to get past generic responses.</p>

        <p>What psychotherapists have to offer is a method of helping individuals get to their own truths. We ask a question; we know how to listen to the answer; we ask another question.</p>
