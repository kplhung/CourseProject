        <p>IN 1864, when the inventor John Ericsson moved to Beach Street between Varick and Hudson Streets, his elegant house faced the private St. John's Park, which was built as one of the city's most ambitious residential squares. When Ericsson, the designer of the ironclad warship Monitor in the Civil War, died in 1889, his house was surrounded by factories and a freight railroad.</p>
        <p>Now, as TriBeCa continues to evolve as a residential district, a new apartment building is blocking the last, shadowy traces of his house, on what was renamed Ericsson Place in the 1920's.</p>
        <p>The area bounded by Beach, Hudson, Laight and Varick Streets was laid out as a private square by the Vestry of Trinity Church, which still owns much property in the area. In 1807 the church built the 214-foot-high St. John's Chapel on the Varick Street side, and the square was designed with paths and plantings.</p>
        <p>Private houses sprang up around the square, and it was soon a fashionable address. Thomas Addis Emmet, who had been involved in revolutionary activities in Ireland with his brother, Robert, and had then been deported, lived at 30 Beach Street in the 1810's and 1820's while he was a prominent lawyer.</p>
        <p>An 1851 directory shows Beach Street with several prominent families still in residence -- but also two boarding houses, at 40 and 42 Beach. There were rumors in the 1850's that the park would be sold, and in 1866 the Hudson River Railway Company bought it. The New York Times remarked that the square had ''long ago ceased to be looked upon as an ornament to the city.'' Each lot owner got $13,000 for his share of the park, and the prospect that the old houses would be worth twice as much because of the giant rail depot that soon replaced the square and brought industry to the area.</p>
        <p>Ericsson had been living at 95 Franklin Street early in the Civil War when he developed his plans for the Union forces' Monitor, which in 1862 saved the North from the attacks of the ironclad Merrimac. A Swedish-born marine engineer who in 1844 had designed the U. S. S. Princeton -- the first screw-propeller warship -- Ericsson was a popular hero during the war.</p>
        <p>In 1864 Ericsson bought the three-story brick house at 36 Beach Street. It had a peaked roof, an Ionic-style doorway and marble trim. He outfitted the house with laboratories and workrooms, building an observatory on the roof, and he spent years there working on solar-energy devices.</p>
        <p>RUTH WHITE'S 1960 biography of Ericsson, ''Yankee from Sweden,'' says that he crowded his house with papers, drawings, models and artifacts, among them urns carved from timber salvaged from the Merrimac. He became reclusive, declining to receive even distinguished visitors unless they had a direct relation to his work. According to her account, he built a giant, intricate rat trap in the basement that remained empty.</p>
        <p>The 1880 census recorded Ericsson living in 36 Beach Street with three servants; by that time the houses on both sides had been cut up into boarding houses. Ericsson died at 36 Beach Street in 1889 at age 85. The Times said he had been a near-recluse who had not ventured out for his once-customary evening walks after 1887, because the ''glare and fantastic shadows'' of the new electric lighting on Broadway annoyed him.</p>
        <p>After Ericsson's death, loft and factory construction swept the area. Emmet's old house at 30 Beach Street was demolished (along with 32 Beach) in 1891 for a cold-storage warehouse fronting at 35-39 North Moore Street, and the same company built 27-29 North Moore, running through to replace 24-28 Beach Street.</p>
        <p>In 1908 -- the year Trinity Church closed St. John's Chapel -- the house at 34 Beach Street was replaced with a loft building, and in 1912 the row houses at the corner of Beach and Varick were replaced with the present police station.</p>
        <p>In 1920, when Ericsson's house was demolished for a one-story garage, The Times described it as ''a dilapidated Italian tenement, but the high-ceilinged rooms still retained their fancy carved mantelpieces and ornamental wall work.''</p>
        <p>Some of the house's furniture and memorabilia are preserved in the American Swedish Historical Museum in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>THE rail depot was demolished in the 1930's, and the site was later filled with the giant sweeping curves of the exit roadway from the Holland Tunnel, which now dominates the square. In recent years the residential conversions that began farther south in TriBeCa have hit this area too.</p>
        <p>Last year the architect Joseph Pell Lombardi finished the condominium conversion of a former warehouse at 27-29 North Moore Street, which extends to Beach Street. Mr. Lombardi, one of the developers, carefully preserved the surviving ghostly outlines of the common wall that separated 22 and 24 Beach, clearly visible in the areaway at the side of the police station.</p>
        <p>Although the upper walls of the converted warehouse are neatly painted in red, the ghost of the earlier buildings -- with the characteristic sloping roof and projecting chimneys -- are in white.</p>
        <p>At the other end of the block, the corresponding ghost of 36 Beach Street has survived on the wall of the warehouse at 34 Beach Street since the Ericsson house was demolished. But now an apartment house at the corner of Hudson and Beach is rising, blocking the view of this tantalizing fragment.</p>
        <p>The site is included in the TriBeCa West Historic District, but Terri Rosen Deutsch, a spokeswoman for the Landmarks Preservation Commission, said that the agency has decided not to protect oddities like the ghost of the Ericsson house.</p>
        <p>Harry Kendall, whose firm, Byrns Kendall &amp; Schieferdecker, is designing the new building, said that although the new building is rising to nine stories, the side wall sets back after a few feet, and some residents will be able to see the wall. His building is taking an address on Hudson Street instead of Ericsson Place, just as the residential conversions facing Ericsson have all chosen North Moore Street for their addresses.</p>
        <p>The Ericsson name, though an important part of American history, apparently carries little contemporary cachet.</p>
