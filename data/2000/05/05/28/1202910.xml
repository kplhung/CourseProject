        <p>NEW HAVEN schools sponsored a field trip recently -- not for students, but for prospective teachers.</p>
        <p>The New Haven district held its second annual teacher visitation day last month in an attempt to help fill at least 100 expected vacancies next school year in areas such as math, science, library media and special education. With a shortage of teachers, New Haven has learned that visitation days is a great way to find teachers. Last year, the school system hired five teachers of the 17 who attended the event.</p>
        <p>''I think people need a realistic view of what teaching in an urban school setting is like,'' said Starlett Wilder, director of staff placement and evaluation for the district. ''They need to actually speak with administrators and visit the classrooms in order to make an informed decision. Some people were fearful until they actually met the children.''</p>
        <p>More than 90 people turned out this year to visit city schools and hear from top administrators what kind of teachers the district is looking for -- and what it can offer to new hires.</p>
        <p>Besides Connecticut, they came from Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Delaware, North Carolina, Illinois and Puerto Rico. They included those just finishing college as well as many middle-aged career changers. The candidates listened to the sales pitch from Superintendent Reginald Mayo and other administrators in the conference room of the Board of Education's headquarters on Meadow Street.</p>
        <p>Eleanor Osborne, assistant superintendent of curriculum and instruction, explained that the district has developed standards for each grade, has lowered the classroom student-teacher ratio to 25 to 1 and has introduced the ''apprentice model'' in which some new teachers work with a master teacher in the same classroom, getting continuous, hands-on supervision and support. If there's a para-professional in the lower grades, the adult-child ratio is half that.</p>
        <p>''We believe in choice,'' Dr. Mayo said, talking about New Haven's magnet school program, calling it the best in the state and a model for other districts.</p>
        <p>He added that several of the magnet schools are inter-district, attracting a total of 550 students from other towns, a figure that will rise to 700 next year. (The city's inter-district magnet schools have been praised by the State Department of Education as being the most successful at bringing suburban students into an urban system.)</p>
        <p>Dr. Mayo also lauded the small size of many of the city's schools. ''We have seven high schools,'' he said, for a total high school population of only 4,300. ''That's unheard of. But we believe the smaller the better.''</p>
        <p>If it all seemed too good to be true, it was in the sense that the district was showing only its good side -- no mention was made of the district's test scores, which hover near the bottom in the state, or the drop-out rate of 29 percent.</p>
        <p>After hearing all the praise and promises, the prospective teachers piled into yellow school buses to tour a group of elementary, middle or high schools.</p>
        <p>Most of them took the elementary tour of three magnet schools. At each one, the principal and usually a second administrator greeted them, gave them a thumbnail sketch of the school's philosophy, and then a walk through several classrooms.</p>
        <p>David Bilmes of Middlebury, who attended the event, had been a journalist at The Danbury News Times for 15 years. ''I made a career move in journalism last year that didn't work out,'' he said. ''I was at a crossroads. I decided change was good.''</p>
        <p>He's now studying at Southern Connecticut State University for a master's in library science, a field he decided on after volunteering in the library of his son's school for six years.</p>
        <p>''I felt like it was a good atmosphere,'' he said of the first school, Davis Street Magnet. Davis is a Comer School -- following the principles, especially parental involvement, established by James Comer, an educator from Yale University. ''I've been learning about Comer schools, so it was nice to be inside one,'' Mr. Bilmes said.</p>
        <p>He added that after driving through many a snowstorm to get to his newspaper job, ''I want a career with snow days.''</p>
        <p>The next stop was Edgewood Magnet, an elementary school that was recently renovated and expanded into a K-8 school. The walls sweep in arcs rather than right angles. Light comes in from large windows. In an art room, children were working with clay. Next door in the music room, 10 pairs of young boys and girls were dancing to recorded music, following directions from the music teacher.</p>
        <p>Lena Battisto of Bristol is finishing her teaching degree at Central Connecticut State University. She heard about the visitors' day through a career fair at her school.</p>
        <p>''The technology in each classroom is amazing,'' Ms. Battisto said. ''It seems like a very together staff, working collaboratively.''</p>
        <p>Lisa Ripley of North Haven has taught for two years and is now working in the North Branford schools. She said she'd like to stay there, but she is also looking at other options.</p>
        <p>''I always felt it was up to me alone to find a job, that no one was out there looking for me,'' she said, until she came to New Haven, where, she said, ''I feel welcomed and needed and appreciated.''</p>
        <p>Stacy Ouellette of Willimantic is finishing her degree at Eastern Connecticut State University. She said she's applied to 80 districts, ''but this is the only one that's actually started the interviewing process. No other district does this kind of thing -- they are so open to showing people what New Haven has to offer.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Ouellette said she liked the diversity she observed in the schools she visited.</p>
        <p>The racial breakdown of the student body in the New Haven system is 57 percent African American, 28 percent Latino, 13 percent white and 2 percent Asian, according to the school system. Of the 1,600 teachers, almost two-thirds are white; a little over a fifth are African American and fewer than a tenth are Latino.</p>
        <p>At least three-quarters of the people on this tour were white, with the rest were divided between blacks and Latinos.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wilder said six teachers from this year's visitation have already been offered contracts for next school year. She said she expects to offer contracts to at least 15 other candidates who participated in the day once they are certified or have further interviews. For the current school year, she had to fill 175 positions, including late summer retirements. That always results in last-minute scrambling, which is hard on teachers, administrators and students.</p>
        <p>''We interviewed many good candidates, people who will be a good match for us,'' Ms. Wilder said. ''We've identified people who want to be here in New Haven.''</p>
