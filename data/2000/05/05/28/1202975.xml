        <p>Jane Cox letter takes exception to David Bouchier's May 14 Mother's Day column (S)</p>

        <p>This time moms are on know-it-all David Bouchier's hit list [''Here's What Mothers Are All About,'' May 14], despite his weak effort to say ''Shame on you'' for remembering Mom only on Mainstream Mothers' Day. Again he shows that subtlety is not his game. Last Fathers' Day, in his usual unfunny wail of a pooh-bah, Mr. Bouchier took on fathers who conveyed feelings. Alas! Mr. Bouchier must have had a bumpy childhood.</p>
