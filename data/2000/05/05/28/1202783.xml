        <p>I STOOD shivering, as quietly as I could, as afternoon shadows stretched across the river around us. The water was above my waist, lapping at the bib of my neoprene coveralls, and there was nothing to insulate me from the conclusion that I was out of my depth. Barely 20 feet away my adversary had begun to taunt me, rising to the surface to slurp down every defenseless bug around -- save the imposter at the end of my line.

        <p>I STOOD shivering, as quietly as I could, as afternoon shadows stretched across the river around us. The water was above my waist, lapping at the bib of my neoprene coveralls, and there was nothing to insulate me from the conclusion that I was out of my depth. Barely 20 feet away my adversary had begun to taunt me, rising to the surface to slurp down every defenseless bug around -- save the imposter at the end of my line. I cast my rod again, a bit less awkwardly. Again I was ignored.</p>
        <p>I reminded myself that we had come to this far corner of northern California for more than just the fish. My father and I had both been tempted by friends' stories about the spare beauty of the place, the open spaces and the quiet.</p>
        <p>Hours into our first encounter with fly fishing, we seemed already to be sloughing off some outer skin of our city lives. A few days of this, we figured, would be a nice chance to spend some time together without much else going on. We might even learn to handle a fly rod.</p>
        <p>Not so long before, I had felt proudly immune to the plague of fly-fishing madness that followed Robert Redford's film ''A River Runs Through It.'' Surely, I thought, life was too short to spend whole, tedious hours of it fashioning little ersatz bugs. Not to mention the countless innocent trout that would be quarry for stockbrokers got up like Brad Pitt.</p>
        <p>Several years passed, though, and the fad faded. I found myself being preached to by a couple of friends whose commitment to the sport apparently involved some secret vow to convert others; my qualms began to erode. But there were still hurdles: the expensive fishing gear, the various complex knots, the abiding mystery of the ersatz bugs.</p>
        <p>Our solution was a company called Clearwater Trout Tours. Clearwater runs both a guiding service and a fly-fishing school out of a small inn on Hat Creek, an hour's drive east from Redding and at the center of some of the best wild trout waters in the west. Many of its customers are anglers who know what they're doing and can choose where they want to do it.</p>
        <p>But the company and its proprietor, Dick Galland, have a strong pedagogical bent, and they offer instruction that ranges from basic techniques to a course for experts called The Enlightened Master.</p>
        <p>The standard beginners' class that we took first, in the fall of 1997, was called Mastering the Art of Fly Fishing. Given that we started after lunch on a Wednesday and finished up at noon the following Sunday, mastery was hardly in the cards. But our instructors balanced their respect for the sport's complexities with an attitude that we ought to learn quickly enough to enjoy the experience, catch some fish and be able to venture out again on our own.</p>
        <p>After our first few hours, I wondered whether this wasn't like taking a quick Berlitz course in Chinese. Our class of six -- my father and I; a businessman from Los Angeles and his daughter, a radio executive; and a married couple in their late 30's -- had assembled around a big wooden table in the main dining room of the lodge. Our instructors passed out handbooks, and they looked encouragingly thin. But by the sixth page the booklet was already diagramming something called a ''double-surgeon's knot.'' By page 21 it was advising on the proper deployment of a ''slip-bobber and minjig combination.'' Then we started to practice some basic knots, and I was reminded why I'd never made it to Weebelo.</p>
        <p>Fly fishing is essentially an elaborate fraud. It is perpetrated by choosing a faux bug to match whatever the fish are eating, disguising the bug's provenance with a very thin nylon line, and then serving up line and bug with an elegance that would test the best Parisian waiters. Trout are not as dumb as they look: if the end of one's line is not assembled of the proper monofilament and properly turned knots, it will slop down before a fish with all the subtlety of a burger at Hooters.</p>
        <p>Surprisingly enough, though, even the double-surgeon's knot turned out to be doable. After a while, the tackle started to seem less complicated. A lesson on different kinds of trout water was altogether understandable, and we began to relax. Then we went outside.</p>
        <p>From the sleepy two-lane road that runs through the center of Cassel, Calif. (that is, the post office, the fire station and a small general store), we hadn't at first noticed the long, smooth lawn behind Clearwater's hedges. The grass turned out to be very well suited to the practice of fly casting, and we practiced for quite a while, catching many trees. The rule of our group seemed to be that the less strength one had, the more quickly one grasped the rhythm and stroke that would turn the line overhead in a tight, graceful curve and then roll it out so that the fly dropped delicately at its outstretched end.</p>
        <p>Before the sun had set, we were all tired enough to retire to the lodge for popcorn and beer. Clearwater House is a modest but comfortable place, furnished with arts and crafts pieces and decorated with fishing photographs and river maps. The end tables are stacked with copies of The New Yorker and National Geographic; the book shelves are filled with volumes like ''The Way of a Trout,'' and the encyclopedic ''Caddisflies.'' Old jazz plays on the stereo. The seven guest rooms are fairly small; most have twin beds and all have private baths. Guests can help themselves to homemade cookies and fresh coffee in the dining room or to juice and soft drinks from a refrigerator on the enclosed back porch.</p>
        <p>Breakfasts and dinners, served around big tables in the front and back of the house, were never elegant but always good. In the evenings we fished along a nearby stretch of Hat Creek, with Mount Lassen rising in the distance, or watched such classics of fish video as ''Anatomy of a Trout Stream'' (in which case about half of us usually fell asleep on the living room couches). A more adventurous night might consist of a trip to the 50's-era bowling lanes in the nearby town of Burney, or a drink at the old hotel in Fall River Mills.</p>
        <p>For our first long day on the water our two guides and their apprentice chose a stretch of lower Hat Creek that was shady and relatively slow. The trout were rising so infrequently that I couldn't help wondering about our chances. But by scooping a large screen into the water, our guides were able to show us what they might be eating below the surface: the tiny underwater form of aquatic insects, known as nymphs.</p>
        <p>Duly prepared, we embarked on the practice of ''short-line nymphing.'' This involved casting tiny nymphlike flies upstream and a few feet below the surface with the aid of a tiny lead weight that we attached near the end of the line. We had been instructed to watch our lines closely as the fly drifted with the current, and to set the hook deftly at the slightest sign of line being tugged.</p>
        <p>It was the deft-setting-of-the-hook part that took some work. Although we fished with small fluorescent indicators stuck on our lines -- the training wheels of short-line nymphing -- the slightest pull from a submerged rock or weed was generally enough to prompt us to rip our rods skyward, as in one of those television fishing shows in which the angler hooks a huge marlin. Unfortunately, the technique turns out to be both ineffective for catching trout and unhelpful in keeping one's balance on the slick rocks of the riverbed.</p>
        <p>The ethic at Clearwater and at most other fly fishing schools is ''catch and release.'' This means no trout dinners. More important, it means that the tiny hooks on the flies have no barbs, making it imperative that one keep the line taut once a fish finds the end of it.</p>
        <p>My own experience was that the rare, hooked trout liked to swim frantically in all directions. This generally prompted shouts from the nearest guide about proper positioning, and I usually responded to this instruction by joining my fish in a wild, thrashing dance that must have looked something like Joe Cocker on speed.</p>
        <p>OUR guides would not have passed central casting. I had expected weathered older men in goofy, fly-blown hats, spooning out fish wisdom like cough syrup. Instead we got Mike Peters, an erstwhile ski-racing coach from Mammoth, Calif., and Scott Saiki, a 27-year-old Hawaiian-born surfer and snowboarder whose command of fly fishing technique was impressive even to his fellow guides. Both were as patient as they were knowledgeable (and our second visit to Clearwater last summer suggested that they were by no means the exception).</p>
        <p>Clearwater's owner, Dick Galland, was a pioneer in some of the early Outward Bound programs in Colorado and Texas, and one of his earliest ventures in fishing instruction was a course he taught in San Francisco in the late 1970's called Zen and the Art of Fly Fishing. There is nothing too touchy-feely about Clearwater's approach these days, but the emphasis remains clearly on how one learns to fly-fish rather than on how many one might catch.</p>
        <p>This began to make clearer sense to me on the third day of our ''mastering'' class. We set off for a lower section of the Pit River, a place that our guides referred to portentously as the Pit. The fish beckoned to us from about 300 feet below the road, in water that cut through a canyon spread with brilliant fall colors.</p>
        <p>Wading slowly through the strong current, fighting to keep our balance, it seemed that fly fishing had become a contact sport. Then, wherever we stopped, it was as though we were meeting the fish all over again, this time with the proper introductions. Our nymphing began to look less awkward, and most of us actually caught a few fish.</p>
        <p>The next afternoon we found ourselves in an even more spectacular setting, a spot along Hat Creek called Carbon Flats. Iridescent grasses glowed in the clear water, and even from the banks above we could see big silvery shapes working their way lazily upstream. These trout, it turned out, were some of the most famously coy fish in the west. But by then we were all casting well enough to be satisfied just to stand in the slow current, soak in the sun, and practice. When a few fish began to strike, we shared the thrill.</p>
        <p>Carbon was no less compelling when my father and I returned on our second trip to Clearwater early last summer. This time we took a couple of old friends who had been fly fishing for years, and the four of us shared the wisdom and humor of two of the lodge's most experienced guides, Tom Peppas and Art Teter.</p>
        <p>As spectacular as it had been to see this swatch of northern California at the peak of its autumn foliage, June was even better. The days were warm and long and we switched from neoprene waders to lighter, more comfortable Gore-Tex versions from the Clearwater rental shop. We returned to the Pit to do some more full-impact nymphing, and then spent a quiet, enjoyable day learning to fish from skiffs on the Fall River.</p>
        <p>Almost from the start I wished that I had put in a little practice on my casting and knot-tying in the interim. But part of the joy of fishing with guides was that we could brush up as we went. If anything, Tom and Art were too accommodating, helping us out of so many tangles (literal and figurative) that I was afraid we weren't working hard enough.</p>
        <p>In the end, we felt that our mastering course had given us enough confidence to go on fishing. The knots no longer felt so complex, and we could start thinking about finer points like when to change from one type of fly to another. But none of that seemed to matter much when we went back to Carbon Flats. The setting was again magnificent, and even on a Saturday morning, we had the crystalline river all to ourselves. The trout, however, seemed to see me coming.</p>
        <p>This time, summoning all the delicacy I could, I cast again and again to what seemed like a perfect spot, just ahead of my fat prize. And the fish rose once again to taunt me, eating every bug in sight save mine.</p>
        <p>How to be outsmarted by a trout</p>
        <p>Arranging an Expedition</p>
        <p>For information about Clearwater Trout Tours, contact the company at Clearwater, Box 90, Cassel, Calif. 96016 or call (415) 381-1173 (especially in the winter months) or (530) 335-5500. The lodge is open for guided fishing from the beginning of the trout season in late April until it ends in November. Classes usually run from early May until October.</p>
        <p>Clearwater can be reached from San Francisco (just under six hours by car), from Sacramento (about five hours) and from Reno (slightly less than three hours).</p>
        <p>Classes</p>
        <p>The basic ''mastering'' class costs $995 a person for four nights' lodging, all meals, equipment rental and instruction. There are also intermediate and expert-level courses for both men and women, as well as three courses designed for women, including a women-only ''mastering'' course. Students must buy their own flies and some of their own tackle and fishing licenses, at an added cost of about $100 for the course. Tips to the lodge staff (10 percent of meal and accommodation charges per guest) and the guides ($50 to $90 per guest) are customary but optional.</p>
        <p>Private guiding packages are available throughout the season for $315 a person, including all meals and overnight lodging (double occupancy). Intermediate and expert courses are taught every other month. In winter the company frequently runs fishing tours to such places as New Zealand's South Island, which is famous for its brown trout, and Christmas Island in the south Pacific, a mecca for bonefishing.</p>
        <p>Equipment</p>
        <p>Fly fishing is the gift that keeps on costing. Expect to pay in the $500 range for a good rod and about $200 for a good reel. Not to mention the vest, the waders (neoprene or Gore-Tex, depending on the water temperature and the season), the wading boots and the tackle. The lodge sells fine equipment in its store, but neither the guides nor anyone else made any perceptible push to sell it.</p>
