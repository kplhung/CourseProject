        <p>After coming to White Plains from Manhattan five years ago, Heineken U.S.A. is moving its headquarters again: to White Plains. The short hop from 50 Main Street to 360 Hamilton Avenue will double the floor space for the importer of Heineken and other brands of beer and means just a few blocks' difference in commuting for the company's 113 employees.</p>
        <p>The move is planned for the fall, said T. Daniel Tearno, vice president of corporate affairs, who said the company rebuffed suitors in Fairfield County and other spots around New York State. The company chose to stay in White Plains because ''we have been treated very well by both the city government and the county government,'' Mr. Tearno said.</p>

        <p>As an incentive to sign a 12-year lease with Reckson Associates Realty, the county gave Heineken U.S.A. a sales tax savings on building costs, worth about $250,000. White Plains threw in discounted parking for Heineken employees, and the company also got some money from Empire State Development to train new employees, Mr. Carrera said.</p>
