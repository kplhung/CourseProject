        <p>When a Turkish prosecutor announced recently that he wanted to indict Gen. Kenan Evren, who led the 1980 military coup, officials in Ankara were not amused.</p>
        <p>They quickly announced that the prosecutor had been placed in semiretirement, and then said he would be investigated for abusing his office.</p>
        <p>''For years I waited for someone to open this case, but too much time was passing so I decided to do it myself,'' said the prosecutor, Sacit Kayasu. ''This army is my army, and it should protect me, not repress me.''</p>
        <p>It remains highly unlikely that General Evren, now an 83-year-old retiree, will ever be called to account for his three unsuccessful coup attempts, for the one that succeeded in September 1980, or for the excesses committed during three years of military rule that followed. But the fact that a prosecutor could even consider indicting him reflects a new climate in which the coup, along with other painful episodes in modern Turkish history, can be discussed more openly than ever before.</p>
        <p>Before leaving power in 1983, the military imposed a law giving itself immunity from prosecution for crimes committed during the period when it ran the country. A move to repeal that law is gathering strength, though there is no prospect of a repeal anytime soon.</p>
        <p>According to the official version of the events of 1980, Turkey had fallen into such chaos -- with people cowering in their homes as cities were besieged by terror -- that the military was forced to intervene. The arrest of thousands of people after the coup is said to have been a regrettable necessity.</p>
        <p>Attempts to prosecute General Evren are not the only signs that a revisionist view is emerging. Two new films portray the torture that was widespread in military prisons.</p>
        <p>One of the films, called ''Where the Rose Wilted,'' tells the story of an innocent man who is arrested following the coup and, in intensely graphic scenes, savagely tortured by sadistic police officers.</p>
        <p>''How can they do this?'' one character wonders. ''Even beasts wouldn't do such a thing.''</p>
        <p>The other film, ''After the Fall,'' tells the story of the coup through the eyes of a 5-year-old boy whose family is shattered by its effects. His parents are arrested and tortured, his grandmother collapses and dies during an army raid on her house, and his grandfather begins losing his mind as he wonders who is responsible for the tragedy unfolding around him.</p>
        <p>''If one family in a small village suffered so much from the coup, imagine what happened to the whole country,'' said the film's director, Atif Yilmaz. ''The effects of the coup are still with us. A lot of people are still carrying scars after 20 years.''</p>
        <p>Some of those who were tortured after the coup have gone on to become successful in business, journalism and academia. A handful have even been elected to Parliament, including one man whose glistening teeth are all false, replacements for the ones smashed out during torture sessions.</p>
        <p>''It's finally becoming possible to acknowledge and discuss these things,'' Mr. Yilmaz said. ''There's more openness and more desire for honesty. Part of it comes from our moving closer to the European Union, but a lot of it just has to do with Turkey starting to grow up. What people like me are doing is trying to give this country back its memory.''</p>
        <p>The 1980 coup is not the only sensitive subject filmmakers are beginning to confront. One much-praised new film deals with the ''wealth tax'' that was imposed on Christian and Jewish Turks during the 1940's with the intention of bankrupting them or forcing them to emigrate. Another portrays Kurds as victims of discrimination and military repression.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't say the military likes this,'' said a foreign ambassador posted in Ankara, ''but they're letting it happen.''</p>
