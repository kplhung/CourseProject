        <p>NEW JERSEY has no shortage of community choirs. From barbershop quartets to contemporary gospel choirs, this state offers a full spectrum of community vocal performances throughout the year.

The Harmonium Choral Society has found a way to deliver all three with its annual Student Choral Composition Contest.</p>
        <p>Established three years ago as part of the choir's educational outreach program, the contest provides young composers from around the state the opportunity to have their work professionally critiqued and performed.

        <p>NEW JERSEY has no shortage of community choirs. From barbershop quartets to contemporary gospel choirs, this state offers a full spectrum of community vocal performances throughout the year. What distinguishes a choral group among the myriad of offerings are its talent, unusual repertory and community programs. The Harmonium Choral Society has found a way to deliver all three with its annual Student Choral Composition Contest.</p>
        <p>Established three years ago as part of the choir's educational outreach program, the contest provides young composers from around the state the opportunity to have their work professionally critiqued and performed. The 70-member Morris County-based Harmonium, renowned for its musicianship and carefully selected talent, incorporates the winning compositions into its spring concert program.</p>
        <p>This year's contest, with the theme ''Songs of the Earth,'' brought 15 compositions. Anne Matlack, artistic director of Harmonium for the past 13 years, determines the theme for both the contest and concert based on the primary musical selection she chooses for the spring program. ''The typical Harmonium program offers a huge, eclectic range of music,'' she said. ''The contest has become a part of that.''</p>
        <p>To participate, students are required to compose a piece for mixed chorus: soprano, alto, tenor and bass, with a maximum performance time of five minutes. Contestants, who must be sponsored by teachers, are also encouraged to submit original lyrics.</p>
        <p>Compositions are judged on strict criteria, including technical and artistic merit, score legibility, singability, uniqueness and perceived audience appeal. This year's judges included Ms. Matlack, who also serves as organist and choir director for Grace Episcopal Church in Madison; Mark Miller, a Plainfield resident who is Harmonium's composer in residence; Virginia Moravek, director of choral music for the John P. Stevens High School in Edison Township; Paul Somers, composer and publisher of Classical New Jersey; and Robert Butts, the founder and conductor of the Baroque Orchestra of Boonton.</p>
        <p>''There is a range of talent in the submissions, and there's a certain youthful hubris, like, 'Yes, I can set Genesis to music,' '' Ms. Matlack said. ''It's a lot of work to judge all of the pieces, but it's also a lot of fun.''</p>
        <p>All of the entrants receive a detailed critique of their work from the panel of judges, and a public read-through of their compositions, either at Harmonium's spring Choral Musicianship Workshop, which took place on April 1, or at the spring concert. Through a grant from the Geraldine R. Dodge Foundation, the top three students receive cash prizes.</p>
        <p>Stefan Swanson, an 18-year-old Madison High School student, won the grand prize this year for ''E Kounia Tou Theou,'' which in Greek means ''The Cradle of God.'' Mr. Swanson wrote the lyrics in English and asked a classmate to translate them into Greek, because, he said, ''It's an underused language in choral compositions.'' The young composer, who has enrolled in the contest since its inception, plans to become a composition major at Rowan University. Last year, one of his submissions placed third and another received an honorable mention. This year, he earned top honors and $500.</p>
        <p>''The judges' critiques have been so great,'' he said. ''I've never taken composition lessons and I've had to pave my own way. Their comments have been really constructive.''</p>
        <p>''Song of the Sea,'' a composition by Joshua Flores, an 18-year-old trumpet player from High Point, placed second. Mr. Flores, who won a cash prize of $100, said he was excited to hear his work performed. ''I was taught to write music by ear,'' he said. ''I hear it in my head and then I sit down at the piano and polish it. Once it was finished, I would play two parts of the harmony and a friend would play the others on the piano, so I could hear all of the notes together.'' Mr. Flores will attend the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, and plans to major in music education.</p>
        <p>Michael Weinstein, a senior at East Brunswick High School, and Timothy Knipper, a junior at Princeton High School, tied for third place ($50). Honorable mentions were awarded to two other Princeton High students, Michael Mindlin, a junior, and Elaine Fefferman, a senior.</p>
        <p>''I wish something like this had been around when I was in high school,'' said Darren O'Neill, a professional classical guitarist and a first tenor in Harmonium. ''These are excellent fledgling efforts. This contest puts the students on the right track to become composers. And it bridges a generation gap -- the adults in this professional chorus take these kids seriously. It's a gift.''</p>
        <p>The Montville High School Chamber Singers will accompany the chorus on certain songs in the concert, which will also include performances of works by Pedro Gutierrez, Claudio Monteverdi and Lili Boulanger, among others.</p>
