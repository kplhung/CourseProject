        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Patricia Bosworth's insider remembrances brought back my own memories. I was back from Korea and occasionally took a date to the Stork. The bar was small, almost intimate and the drinks relatively inexpensive. I would bring a date, we would have two drinks at the bar,  invariably Sherman Billingsley would come by and say hello, and we never left without a gift. I wish I still had the great-looking Stork Club tie I got at one visit. The Stork Club despite its image, was friendly, relaxed and a great place to impress a lady.  There's nothing like it now.</p>

        <p>Another great joint was Toots Shor's. And then there was Lindy's, the coldest beer and best roast beef I ever tasted.</p>
