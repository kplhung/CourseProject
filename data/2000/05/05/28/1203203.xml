        <p>Greg Ray is a rebel, albeit one who wears mousse and crisply pleated pants.</p>
        <p>His parents fiercely prohibited him from racing cars or doing anything remotely dangerous growing up in Plano, Tex. They told him he could not have Go Karts, Jet Skis or even the sports car he had saved money for by working throughout high school.</p>
        <p>Because Ray could not have speed, of course he craved it all the more. He was addicted to watching the Indianapolis 500.</p>
        <p>At 25 he had a wife, a successful career in the family business renting and chartering yachts, and two Porsches in the garage. But watching reruns of Indy races on cable at 2 a.m., yelling at the drivers making mistakes, Ray had an early midlife crisis.</p>
        <p>''If you think you are so good,'' the voice inside him said, ''why don't you try it?'' Eight months later, without telling his parents, Ray went to driving school. He won the race there, and then nine of his next 10.</p>
        <p>From daydreaming about being Racer X sneaking into the back row of the Indy 500, Ray, now 33, is sitting on the pole Sunday for the 84th Indianapolis 500. He is the reigning Indy Racing League champion and is no longer anonymous. His father, Benny, is no longer critical. His mother, Ginger, is still petrified whenever he gets behind the wheel.</p>
        <p>''If I had started racing Go Karts earlier, maybe I would have won Indy a few times by now, but who knows?'' Ray said. ''I think it came at the right time. I feel more blessed to have lived 25 years on the other side of the fence as a spectator. And then when I got involved, to find I had natural ability, I think I had a lot more respect for it.''</p>
        <p>When Ray bought a $250,000 truck, trailer and car to jump-start his career in 1991, his father rebuked him for making an irresponsible business decision. ''He called me five different ways of stupid,'' Ray said.</p>
        <p>The two barely spoke for his first year in racing. But with his father in attendance for the first time the next year, Ray went from starting last to passing the champion on the final lap of a race at the Texas Motor Speedway, and his father was converted. ''We laugh about it now,'' Ray said.</p>
        <p>Ray had more trouble proving his worth to sponsors when he moved up to the I.R.L. in 1997, after winning championships in smaller series. It was at Indy in 1998 that he made his breakthrough: driving for the low-budget Thomas Knapp Motorsports, Ray was the second-fastest qualifier.</p>
        <p>''We had one car, two engines, four mechanics and one driver,'' Ray recalled. And little else. Fans were handing him $20 and $50 bills to finance his ride, and he tacked one to the inside of his car.</p>
        <p>Ray led 18 laps that year before he fell out of the race with gearbox problems. But his aggressive style was enough to get him noticed, and he signed with the high-profile Team Menard at the end of the year.</p>
        <p>On Sunday Ray will make his fourth start at Indy, having edged the driver from the rival Championship Auto Racing Teams series, Juan Montoya, by a tenth of a second in qualifying.</p>
        <p>Montoya, driving for Chip Ganassi, began racing when he was 5 in Colombia. His early success is in stark contrast to Ray's late development, and the two drivers represent an underlying story to this year's race.</p>
        <p>Ganassi is the only CART team at Indy, ending a five-year drought but not the political feud with the I.R.L. The better known open-wheel racers are associated with CART, which has unofficially boycotted the race since 1996 when the Indianapolis Motor Speedway president, Tony George, formed the I.R.L. and required different engine specifications.</p>
        <p>While the Indy 500 has been depleted of stars the last four years, there is a sense of excitement pulsing through the Brickyard this year. With Montoya, Jimmy Vasser and Al Unser Jr., in the race, winning would be much more significant, Ray said. ''By bringing all the drivers together, it allows you to assess,'' Ray said. ''You want the biggest challenge you can get, so if you are able to come out on top, it means something.''</p>
        <p>Ray commented on the significance of the two series' coming together. ''I would like to see everybody in the same arena on a weekly basis,'' he said. ''But CART, I.R.L., whatever, I'm just a driver. I want to win; it's not one series versus the other. It's drivers versus the others.''</p>
        <p>Maybe, but the mechanics did not see it that way when Ray snatched the pole from Montoya.</p>
        <p>''When I came in after qualifying, I saw just about every mechanic from every Indy Racing League team high-fiving my car,'' Ray said.</p>
        <p>If their drama on the first day of qualifying last weekend was not enough, Billy Boat delivered one of the most exciting Bump Days in race history. With seconds to spare as the final qualification day was ending, Boat took out his third car, after he had crashed one and the gauge went out in his second.</p>
        <p>His former owner, A. J. Foyt, gave him a car, and even though his feet barely reached the pedals, he found enough speed for four laps to qualify 31st. ''That has gotten me as much attention as if I had won the pole,'' Boat said, laughing. ''The race will definitely be lower key than this.''</p>
        <p>The buzz from last Sunday has carried over to this week, from Gasoline Alley, even down to Nascar circles in North Carolina, Foyt said. Driver Eddie Cheever Jr. summarized it perfectly: ''Bump Day was so exciting, I was nearly having a heart attack and I wasn't even in it.''</p>
        <p>PIT STOPS</p>
        <p>EDDIE CHEEVER Jr., BUDDY LAZIER and AL UNSER Jr. are the three former champions in the 33-car field. . . . SARAH FISHER, at 19 the youngest driver, and LYN ST. JAMES, at 53 the oldest, give the race two women simultaneously for the first time.</p>
