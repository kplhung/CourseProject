        <p>EXPERIENCE</p>
        <p>By Martin Amis.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 406 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Talk Miramax Books/Hyperion. $23.95.</p>
        <p>Martin Amis, son of Kingsley and likewise a novelist with acid in his inkwell, was greatly abused by the British press in the mid-1990's, when he left his wife, his agent and his country for another woman, a megabucks book deal and oral surgery so extravagant as to amount to urban renewal. Why Martin's mouth should have been of such consuming interest to anyone outside the broken family circle is a mystery. Nor is it any more exciting to read about in his memoir than it was in the tabs. Yet there is almost as much here about his teeth as there is about his father. This is unfortunate. ''Experience'' is a portmanteau of personal history, ancestor worship and promiscuous opinionizing, and a pinata of literary gossip that Amis beats with a stick, causing many names to drop. (Good names, too: Philip Larkin, Saul Bellow, Christopher Hitchens, Tina Brown and John Travolta. Did you know that Salman Rushdie went to a baseball game with Don DeLillo? That Ian McEwan used to have lunch with Thomas Pynchon?) And if we stay put till the last 100 pages, it will break our heart. But meanwhile we go far too often to the dentist.</p>
        <p>Maybe the son, for whom innocence ended and ''experience'' began when his father left his mother for the novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard, is just stalling. (''Only to him could I talk about what I was doing to my children. Because he had done it to me.'') Maybe chattering about his teeth is avoidance behavior, like the excess of footnotes (''to preserve the collateral thought''), and the quoting so much from the callow letters he wrote home while cramming for his O levels (''to allow the reader . . . to enjoy a few moments of vacuity, of luxurious inanition, before coming to the matter ahead''), and even the nightmare meditations on his cousin Lucy Partington (a 21-year-old embodiment of innocence, whose abduction and murder by the serial killer Frederick West in 1973 is a reason to hate God). Maybe he would rather not arrive at the bend in his story, where his father waits with a glass in his hand. Here is the weight Martin must bear on a traffic island, after a liquid lunch, when Sir Kingsley falls down like all the king's men:</p>
        <p>''It was a work of colossal administration. First came a kind of slow-leak effect, giving me the immediate worry that Kingsley, when fully deflated, would sprawl out into the street on both sides of the island, where there were cars, trucks, sneezing buses. Next, as I grabbed and tugged, he felt like a great ship settling on its side: would it right itself or go under? Then came an impression of overall dissolution and the loss of basic physical coherence. I groped around him, looking for places to shore him up, but every bit of him was falling, dropping, seeking the lowest level, like a mudslide.''</p>
        <p>This is only as funny as we are forgetful of our own drunks. Otherwise, not even needing Martin's mouth, it screams. Really, if he insists on going on about dental work in Nabokov and Joyce, he ought at least to mention Gnter Grass and ''Local Anesthetic.'' It's not as though his molars were a Philoctetes wound, explaining painful art. And even if it were, when we consider that William Carlos Williams, after a series of strokes, had to hunt and peck his poems by using his left hand to steer his right forefinger to each and every typewriter key, we are reminded that sportswriters shouldn't complain when the hot dogs are cold in the press box. So let's not review the teeth.</p>
        <p>Instead, there is young Martin, betting on dogs and smoking hash in coffee bars like the Picasso. Or dropping in, an insouciant teenager, on ''the warrior-poet'' Robert Graves in Spain. Or having an affair at Oxford with the ''fringe playwright, journalist, looker, prodigy'' Tina Brown. Or moseying on from J. Walter Thompson to The Times Literary Supplement to The New Statesman, where pub-crawling buddies include Julian Barnes, James Fenton and, of course, Hitchens (''Whose turn is it to pay for me?''). Playing pinball, reviewing books, going to bullfights. A first novel (to which Auberon Waugh, who knew exactly what it felt like, would be kind), a first marriage and a first child. Meeting Saul Bellow and having a midlife crisis. A second marriage and an unsuspected daughter, who turns up suddenly at the age of 19, years after her mother committed suicide. New York, Jerusalem, Warsaw, Auschwitz.</p>
        <p>And before we fix on Kingsley, there is Hilary, Martin's remarkable mum, who would marry some more herself. Who had been a kennel maid, and groomed horses, and even worked at the Battersea Zoo. Who was perfectly capable of tending a bar in Malaga, or wheeling about in the burbs with a ''burger-and-furter'' van, or running a fish-and-chips shop in Ann Arbor, Mich. (called Lucky Jim's!). Who couldn't get through a glass of dry sherry without adding a couple of sugars. And who returned to nursemaid Kingsley through his protracted dying: ''She is in it for the duration,'' says her son. ''There is no love anymore, only the memory of love.'' And: ''My mother was innocent. Then experience came, and she experienced it. And then she got her innocence back. I have always wondered how she did that.''</p>
        <p>Throughout, Martin will lay down the dubious law. On life, for instance: ''At the birth of your child, you forgive your parents everything, without a second thought, like a velvet revolution'' -- which simply isn't true, not for long, not even in Prague. And on literature, as well: Vladimir Nabokov was right about everything important, and Edmund Wilson wrong, except for Saul Bellow. Kingsley's ''Old Devils'' ''stands in comparison with any English novel of the century'' except ''Ulysses.'' Salman Rushdie was so wrong about Samuel Beckett that they almost got into a fistfight: ''I really do hate Beckett's prose,'' says pugnacious Martin; ''every sentence is an assault on my ear.''</p>
        <p>We'll get back to Beckett in a minute. But Kingsley, Unlucky Jim: as if in the manner of ''Time's Arrow,'' Martin's backward novel, we see him in reverse, from the red chair in which he sat at the end, capable only of typing, over and over, the single word ''seagull''; back through smoky solutions to the doubling of his weight, the destruction of his liver and the woman-hating novels he couldn't help writing after Elizabeth Jane Howard left him with a goodbye suggestion of Alcoholics Anonymous; back to the knighthood he especially prized because he had kinky dreams about the queen, whom he called Corky; back before the right-wing ranting in favor of the war in Vietnam and against the ''terrorist'' Nelson Mandela and going on about Americans and Jews; back, back, back, to the father he was to Martin before the boozing and the adulteries, to the friend he was to Philip Larkin before he got married and rich; all the way back to his own unsatisfactory father, to whom he would say, too late, in a poem: ''I'm sorry you had to die / To make me sorry / You're not here now.''</p>
        <p>TO his grandson, shortly before his death, Kingsley said: ''I used to be important. But I'm not anymore.'' To Saul Bellow, afterward, Martin can't stop himself from blurting, ''You'll have to be my father now.'' And to Martin Amis, in his pride and grief, I'd like to quote some prose by Samuel Beckett, about a father and a son walking together in the hills of Ireland:</p>
        <p>''Hand in hand with equal plod they go. In the free hands -- no. Free empty hands. Back turned both bowed with equal plod they go. The child hand raised to reach the holding hand. Hold the old holding hand. Hold and be held. Plod on and never recede. Slowly with never a pause plod on and never recede. Backs turned. Both bowed. Joined by held holding hands. Plod on as one. One shade. Another shade.''</p>
