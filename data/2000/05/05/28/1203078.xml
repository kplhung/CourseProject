        <p>''THE 1900 HOUSE'' comes with the appeal of a literary dream come true: you are about to walk into a lush Victorian novel. In this four-part series, a real English family moves into a house equipped with turn-of-last-century conveniences and lives as they would have a hundred years ago. So imagine how surprising it is when the mother of the family looks into a camera hidden in her closet (the better to record the video diaries each family member makes) and says: ''I've just had my first bath and a miserable affair it was, too. About four inches of hot water.'' Her face and voice filled with weariness, she adds: ''I was just so desperate to wash myself properly. I've come to the conclusion that Victorian cleanliness is just nothing like the standards of cleanliness that we have today.''</p>

        <p>''THE 1900 HOUSE'' comes with the appeal of a literary dream come true: you are about to walk into a lush Victorian novel. In this four-part series, a real English family moves into a house equipped with turn-of-last-century conveniences and lives as they would have a hundred years ago. So imagine how surprising it is when the mother of the family looks into a camera hidden in her closet (the better to record the video diaries each family member makes) and says: ''I've just had my first bath and a miserable affair it was, too. About four inches of hot water.'' Her face and voice filled with weariness, she adds: ''I was just so desperate to wash myself properly. I've come to the conclusion that Victorian cleanliness is just nothing like the standards of cleanliness that we have today.''</p>
        <p>In a summer crammed with four new reality series, ''The 1900 House'' on PBS represents the high-minded side of the genre; over on the lurid side, CBS's ''Survivor,'' in which 16 strangers are stranded on an island in the South China Sea, revels in its own tackiness. ''Early on they were eating rats, much earlier than they expected,'' a producer of this endlessly hyped show said when promoting it on ''Access Hollywood.'' (Earlier than they expected?)</p>
        <p>Other reality shows focus on more mudane punishments: Fox's ''American High'' follows high school students in a Chicago suburb through their senior year; CBS's ''Big Brother'' confines strangers in a house where they are filmed 24 ours a day. All offer a twist on ordinary armchair traveling as they invite viewers to vacation in other people's lives.</p>
        <p>The blatant and reassuring message is that your comfy home life is best (nice baths, no rats). The veiled truth is that televised reality is not exactly real. The people chronicled are not actors, not scripted. But, except in ''American High,'' the circumstances of their lives are shaped as carefully as any fiction, the players chosen with just as keen an eye for dramatic conflict. After all, who would watch a show with nothing but lazy days in a hammock and peaceful sleep in a thatched-roof hut? It's much catchier to be the show that sets up the soap opera question: while they're for-aging for food on that tropical island, how will Sean, the unmarried 30-year-old neurologist, get along with Susan, the married 38-year-old truck driver?</p>
        <p>This summer may turn all of us into Peeping Toms, yet that voyeurism may be the series' least creepy social aspect. This is also the summer when Darwin meets Orwell, with the survival of the fittest captured by ever-present cameras. In ''Survivor,'' the participants vote group members off, one by one, with the last survivor winning the million-dollar prize.</p>
        <p>''Big Brother,'' the show so proud of its Orwellian roots it borrowed its title from ''1984,'' sounds like an experiment with human subjects: the 10 people in the house are denied access to television, computers and other sanity-preserving links to the outside world. Here it is the audience that regularly votes someone out of the house, until one remaining resident wins half a million dollars at the end of September. Maybe next year we can watch that person in televised therapy. With the ''Big Brother'' cast cut off from phones and the ''1900 House'' family deprived of junk food, it seems a matter of time before somebody snaps. (The ''American High'' cast can still go to MacDonald's, but that doesn't mean they get off easy; nothing is more Darwinian than high school.)</p>
        <p>It's easy to see why the networks, which used to go into summer hibernation, are now offering fresh shows; with tough competition from cable, they can't afford not to. A more intriguing issue is why the season is so crowded with fraught reality series. The fact that these quasi-documentaries are cheaper to make than entertainment shows is only part of the answer. The reality genre also neatly picks up on several current trends: as news and entertainment blend together, it's natural for real life to bleed into the force-fed reality of these series; offering prize money links ''Survivor'' and ''Big Brother'' to the current game-show craze; and in the age of celebrity, ordinary people are living out the dream that fame is accessible to anyone.</p>
        <p>''Big Brother,'' which will be on five nights a week, stands the best chance of making its players stars, and its application form for contestants points in that direction. One question reads: ''Have you ever had a restraining order issued against you?'' (That's the honorary Rick Rockwell question, inspired by the antihero of ''Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'') Another asks, ''What would you do if 'Big Brother' made you famous?'' Throughout the summer, viewers will be left with more philosophical issues. What kind of person wants to live on camera? (Here's where we get to feel smug.) And why do we want to watch them? (Oh, never mind.)</p>
        <p>The overload of reality series is just one sign of upheaval in the summer television season. Another is that CBS and Fox seem to have swapped personalities. The fogey-friendly CBS has the sleaziest series in ''Survivor'' and ''Big Brother,'' while the relentlessly crass Fox has a series with a sterling artistic pedigree. ''American High'' was made by R.J. Cutler, the cinema verite veteran known for penetrating documentaries like ''The Warm Room.''</p>
        <p>With Mr. Cutler's series, ina s ense cinema verite has come full circle. MTV's ''Real World'' borrowed the verite approach and layered on its own contrived reality, selecting a handful of ready-to-explode 20-somethings to live together in a house. The series has become such a staple that it is entering its ninth season. (A marathon of all eight previous seasons will run this Friday through Monday morning; the new season of ''The Real World,'' set in New Orleans, will begin June 13, followed the next week by its on-the-road spinoff, ''Road Rules,'' this time set in the United States.)</p>
        <p>The producers of ''The Real World'' have announced a project for ABC in which they will create an Internet magazine and chronicle the professional and private lives of its staff on both televison and the Internet. The plan is for this project to appear during the 2000-01 season, but the results of the summer may have something to do with that. Programmers, have to be wondering whether, by September, viewers will feel bludgeoned by so many so-called lives.</p>
