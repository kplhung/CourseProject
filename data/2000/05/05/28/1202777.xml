        <p>Remembering Shaw</p>
        <p>Q. I'm planning a visit to George Bernard Shaw's estate in Hertfordshire, England and would like to know of events there commemorating his death 50 years ago. -- Lauren Lindyet, Syracuse</p>
        <p>A. The 50th anniversary of Shaw's death is indeed being recognized at his former home in the Hertfordshire village of Ayot St. Lawrence, 26 miles north of London. Performances and exhibitions are among the events.</p>
        <p>Shaw's Corner, as the Edwardian house is known, was the dramatist's home from 1906 to 1950. It is now a house museum operated by the National Trust. Visitors can explore the rooms, which remain as Shaw left them. Personal items, like a collection of hats and walking sticks, as well as photographs of Shaw's  friends -- T. E. Lawrence, Gandhi and Alfred Hitchcock, among them -- are displayed throughout the house.</p>
        <p>This year's anniversary events include a weekend of performances on  July 21 to 23. Two plays will be presented by the Shaw Society: ''Why She Would Not,'' which explores male and female relations, and ''The Inca of Perusalem,'' a wry take on would-be world dictators. Performances start at 6:30 p.m.; tickets are $15 (at a rate of 67 pence to the dollar).</p>
        <p>On June 8 and Sept. 7, visitors may take guided walks around Ayot St. Lawrence. The 90-minute itinerary is based on Shaw's ''Rhyming Guide,'' which is written in verse and illustrated by Shaw. The tour includes  visits to the village's 15th-century Old Church and the 18th-century Ayot Manor. The cost is $7.45.</p>
        <p>Beginning Oct. 29, a literary exhibition will include Shaw's rehearsal copy of ''Pygmalion'' and his Nobel Prize certificate.</p>
        <p>Shaw's Corner is open Wednesday to Sunday from April 1 to Oct. 29. Admission is $2.60. Information: (44-1494) 755567.</p>
        <p>Another Side of Rio</p>
        <p>Q. A Brazilian friend suggests I visit the favelas near Rio de Janeiro. Does anyone arrange trips from Rio? -- Rene Pattinger, New York, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A. There are some 570 favelas surrounding Rio de Janeiro. These culturally vibrant settlements, which started out as shantytowns many years ago, have become popular destinations for travelers interested in seeing how most urban Brazilians live. The favelas of Rocinha and Vila Canoa are the focus of trips offered by three local companies.</p>
        <p>Jeep Tour takes small groups on  daily, three-hour visits to Rocinha, Brazil's largest favela, with 250,000 inhabitants, about 10 miles from Copacabana. After visiting with residents, the group explores on foot the narrow streets lined with fanciful and often brightly painted buildings. The commercial center includes a market that sells produce and medicinal herbs.The favela's samba school, where Carnival costumes and floats are made, is also on the itinerary. Tours cost $30 a person. Information: (5521) 522-1620.</p>
        <p>Qualitours also offers daily tours to Rocinha. The visit begins on the northern edge of the favela, where you can admire the view of Sugar Loaf. The second stop is near the post office for an optional motorcycle ride through the favela. A visit with a local family and a trip to the market are also included. The price is $35 a person. Information: (5521) 232-9717.</p>
        <p>Favela Tour offers daily trips to Rocinha and nearby Vila Canoa. Vila Canoa, a settlement with some 2,500 people, has recently joined the Favela-Bairro project started by Rio's City Hall and aimed at improving life in the favelas. In Vila Canoa's case, this has resulted in a new garbage and sewage system. Visitors also go to a craft center and other local businesses. The cost is $20 a person. Information: (5521) 322-2727</p>
        <p>Paris in Picasso's Day</p>
        <p>Q. I'm interested in going to some of the sites in Paris that are associated with Picasso. Do you know of places I might visit? -- Loretta Collins, Portland, Me.</p>
        <p>A. When Pablo Picasso traveled to Paris for the 1900 Universal Exhibition, he was immediately drawn to the city's creative atmosphere and ended up spending some 40 years there. Unfortunately, most of the places where he lived and worked are either no longer standing or not open to the public. But you can, of course, still stroll through the neighborhoods that he helped make famous.</p>
        <p>The neighborhood of Montmartre, with its winding streets and steep stairways, was Picasso's first home. What was known as the Bateau-Lavoir (Laundry Barge) at 13, place Emile Goudeau, where Picasso lived between 1904 and 1909, burned down in 1970, and has been replaced by a concrete structure that now houses artists' ateliers. The Bateau-Lavoir  is where Gertrude Stein came to sit for her portrait. Not far away, the Moulin de la Galette, a dance hall depicted by Picasso in a painting of the same name, once stood at 79, rue Lepic beneath two windmills. It was destroyed in 1960 and nothing on the site today tells of its existence, not even a plaque. However, two other places that Picasso frequented -- the cabaret known as Lapin Agile, at 22, rue des Saules, and the Mere Catherine (the subject of a 1905 painting) at 6, place du Tertre -- are still in operation.</p>
        <p>In 1909, Picasso moved to an apartment at 11, boulevard de Clichy. The area is still full of establishments from his era, like the club Moulin Rouge, and the Wepler Brasserie at 14, place de Clichy.</p>
        <p>In 1912 he moved to Montparnasse. Today's Place Pablo Picasso, at the crossroads of the Rue Vavin and the Boulevard du Montparnasse, commemorates the time Picasso spent at various addresses in the area, including 242, boulevard Raspail and 5 bis, rue Schoelcher. He was a regular in two brasseries, which you can still visit -- Closerie des Lilas, 171, boulevard du Montparnasse, and La Rotonde, 105, boulevard du Montparnasse.</p>
        <p>During World War II he lived at 7, rue des Grands Augustins, on the Left Bank, around the corner from his newest lover, Dora Maar. It was here that he painted ''Guernica.''</p>
        <p>The Picasso Museum in Paris is a wonderful place to view paintings, sculptures, collages and ceramics from all of the artist's major periods. The museum, in the 17th-century Hotel Sale at 5, rue Thorigny, is open Wednesday through Monday from 9:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. and until 8 p.m. on Thursdays. Admission is $5.25 (at a rate of 7.3 francs to the dollar), $3.40 for those 18 to 25. Information: (33-1) 42.71.25.21.</p>
