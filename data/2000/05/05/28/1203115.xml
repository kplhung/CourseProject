        <p>Arthur Danley, letter, responds to Fred Brock's May 7 article on 'silent' generation, those Americans, now in the mid-50's to early 70's, who are too young to have fought in World War II but too old to be considered baby boomers; drawing (M)</p>

        <p>In ''The Silent Generation Seeks Its Due (May 7)'' Fred Brock looked at Americans who are too young to have fought in World War II but too old to be considered baby boomers. Members of that age group, in their mid-50's to early 70's, often feel overlooked by employers, marketers and the popular culture.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The column accurately describes many of the characteristics of a group that I am associated with. In addition to being overlooked by purveyors of pop culture, advertisers, and employers, we have to contend with the full force of the federal government which, by a 40-year-old rule, prevents us from working at our profession -- pilots for U.S. scheduled air carriers. We are forced by federal regulations to retire upon reaching our 60th birthday.</p>

        <p>The column accurately describes many of the characteristics of a group that I am associated with. In addition to being overlooked by purveyors of pop culture, advertisers, and employers, we have to contend with the full force of the federal government which, by a 40-year-old rule, prevents us from working at our profession -- pilots for U.S. scheduled air carriers. We are forced by federal regulations to retire upon reaching our 60th birthday.</p>
        <p>In an era of rapid expansion in the airline industry it makes no sense to forcibly retire the most experienced pilots who have demonstrated their ability to continue their careers by passing medical and neuropsychological tests far beyond what under age 60 pilots are required to take.  We are the teachers and mentors to the new generation of pilots being hired and trained today and our forced retirement deprives the traveling public of the benefit  of our experience.</p>
