        <p>Philip Shabecoff letter disputes Mark Hertsgaard's May 7 review of his book Earth Rising: American Environmentalism in the 21st Century</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In his review of my book ''Earth Rising: American Environmentalism in the 21st Century'' (May 7), Mark Hertsgaard gratuitously suggests that funding from two foundations may have influenced its content. It most certainly did not. Neither Joshua Reichert of the Pew Charitable Trusts nor Wade Greene of Rockefeller Financial Services sought in any way to shape the content of the book, nor would I have accepted any such direction. I did interview them, along with nearly 100 other experts, precisely because, as Hertsgaard notes, they are influential within the environmental movement.</p>

        <p>As for some of my analysis being ''wishful'' thinking, that remains to be seen. The proposals in the book are intended, in fact, to help prod environmentalists away from wishful thinking toward effective action.</p>
