        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The article on April 30 about cell phones in vehicles [''Board Urged to Adopt Law on Cell Phone Use''] was very poignant but it was not strong enough.</p>
        <p>People who are using their cellular phones while driving are most definitely not paying attention to their driving. I have been behind cellular phone users going very slowly in the left lane and unaware that they were causing difficulties, who suddenly discover that they are passing their exit and make dangerous lane changes, who are unaware that their child is hanging out of the rear window and throwing things at passing drivers.</p>
        <p>They have as much awareness of the road as drivers who are tipsy. Perhaps they should be treated the same way. They are dangerous, and cellular phone use and driving do not mix.</p>
