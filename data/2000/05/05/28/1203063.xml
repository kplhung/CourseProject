        <p>From analyzing how Sir Ernest Shackleton saved all the members of his marooned expedition to Antarctica, Dennis N. T. Perkins, author of ''Leading at the Edge,'' has distilled 10 rules of leadership:</p>
        <p>1. Never lose sight of the ultimate goal, and focus energy on short-term objectives.</p>
        <p>His expedition goals dashed, Shackleton embraced the new goal of bringing every man out alive, and he pursued that objective in every waking hour, as Dr. Perkins demonstrates.</p>
        <p>2. Set a personal example with visible, memorable symbols and behavior.</p>
        <p>Crossing the frigid seas, Shackleton stood in the bow, exposed to the elements. When it became necessary to travel light, he conspicuously discarded his gold watch, gold lighter and gold coins.</p>
        <p>3. Instill optimism and self-confidence, but stay grounded in reality.</p>
        <p>Shackleton drew the best from his crew, mainly by keeping everyone busy. He kept up a cheerful demeanor even while sharing dire news.</p>
        <p>4. Take care of yourself: Maintain your stamina and let go of guilt.</p>
        <p>Take care of himself, Shackleton did not. His every thought was for his crew. Shackleton made mistakes, but never dwelled on them.</p>
        <p>5. Reinforce the team message constantly: ''We are one -- we live or die together.''</p>
        <p>In everything he did, Shackleton required sharing and mutual reliance.</p>
        <p>6. Minimize status differences and insist on mutual respect.</p>
        <p>Shackleton insisted that officers and crew bear the ordeal equally. He took his turn at kitchen chores and refused to accept larger food rations.</p>
        <p>7. Master conflict -- deal with anger in small doses, engage dissidents, and avoid needless power struggles.</p>
        <p>Shackleton demoted a bully and stared down a would-be mutineer, but accepted grousing as an essential outlet. He took personal charge of the most difficult crew members.</p>
        <p>8. Find something to celebrate and something to laugh about.</p>
        <p>Incredibly, Shackleton roused the enfeebled men to celebrate June 22, 1916, Midwinter's Day of their second grueling Antarctic winter. They mustered a musical and poetry revue in 26 acts.</p>
        <p>9. Be willing to take the Big Risk.</p>
        <p>On Elephant Island, Shackleton concluded that starvation was near.  So he led a crew of five in an unprecedented open-boat sail across the globe's most tempestuous waters.</p>
        <p>10. Never give up -- there's always another move.</p>
        <p>When their ship was crushed, they sought to drag their lifeboats hundreds of miles to open water. When that proved impossible, they camped for months on an ice floe. As the floe melted, they set out in boats for distant land. Stymied there, Shackleton sailed for South Georgia. It then took four forays to find and rescue the men left behind.</p>
