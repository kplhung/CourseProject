        <p>It arrives in early April, as reliably as rain showers. Just after healthy leaves sprout from the sycamores and London plane trees that line Riverside Park, they become disfigured and blotchy, and develop lesions. It is not unusual for a tree to lose half its leaves when it attacks, and in some cases, a whole tree defoliates.</p>
        <p>The attacker, a fungus, has a name almost as fearsome as its effect: anthracnose.</p>
        <p>''You've got these very stately trees, with very large leaves and distinctive mottled bark, as you walk up the promenade,'' said James T. Dowell, executive director of Riverside Park Fund, a nonprofit group. ''But when the anthracnose is in full force, you've got trees that don't look healthy. The leaves are twisted and curled and have brown marks on them. What should be very green and lush and verdant in color this time of year is sparse and pale.''</p>
        <p>For several years, anthracnose has plagued trees between 101st and 112th Streets in the park, and the Park Fund has received concerned calls from neighbors of the promenade.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Dowell, the fungus is not deadly, but it ultimately damages the trees, which sometimes sprout a second set of leaves after the first ones die.</p>
        <p>So this year, the park fund has invested $50,000, from an anonymous donor, to treat the park's trees with a fungicide called ZeroTol.</p>
        <p>Crews have sprayed the treatment, a hydrogen peroxide solution, on trees from 72nd to 120th Streets in Riverside Park three times this spring. They intend to douse them twice more in the next few weeks. Mr. Dowell said that the substance is organic and nontoxic, and that all sprayings would take place at night.</p>
        <p>''For many people, the trees in the park are one of its most precious assets, and in Riverside we have two big problems with trees: Dutch Elm disease and this anthracnose,'' Mr. Dowell said. ''There's not much we can do about Dutch elm disease but we hope now we can do something about the anthracnose.''</p>
