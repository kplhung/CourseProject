        <p>MOST museums are studies in silence. That is not the case these days at the Hammond Musem, at the end of a winding road in the wooded hills of northeastern Westchester. Its galleries are filled with dripping and trickling sounds.</p>
        <p>That is because water itself is the medium of choice of several artists taking part in a show that explores the interplay of people, water and wildlife.</p>
        <p>More specifically, the exhibition, ''Unbottled: New York's Water,'' focuses on the sometimes troubled relationship between the water flowing into New York City's 19 upstate reservoirs and the dozens of suburban and rural communities that surround the supply.</p>
        <p>The show, which runs until July 22, was conceived last fall after a meeting between the museum's executive director, Abigail Free, and Paul Thiesing, one of New York City's watershed inspectors, who spends his days looking for illegal dumpers or polluters and his evenings painting and carving artwork that reveals the hidden lives of trout and bass.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thiesing, 39, had come to the museum hoping to arrange to show a few of his works. But Ms. Free saw the potential for a broader show that offered a variety of artistic interpretations of the significance of the extraordinary -- and largely unappreciated -- water supply, which each day provides 1.5 billion gallons of water to 8 million people in the city and nearly 1 million residents of Westchester.</p>
        <p>The water flows by gravity alone, without a single filter -- at least for now -- between gurgling streams and city taps.</p>
        <p>Ms. Free, who said she passes five city-owned reservoirs on her daily drive from Yorktown to the museum, said the meeting with Mr. Thiesing produced a kind of instant revelation about the need for such a show.</p>
        <p>''I was ripe for it,'' she said, as she toured the exhibition with Mr. Thiesing and some visitors. ''I suddenly realized that this beautiful landscape I appreciate every day exists because the city owns this land.''</p>
        <p>''And pays taxes on it,'' added Mr. Thiesing, who, like many city water officials, said he was eager to remind residents of the watershed region that the city is not some foreign invader, but a partner. In that spirit, the city Department of Environmental Protection is a co-sponsor of the show and contributed photographs, art from its own collection and even a piece of steel water main.</p>
        <p>City water officials have been trying to make peace with upstate residents ever since the city began building its water supply in the 1840's.</p>
        <p>Antagonism always followed the expansion of the system of dams and aqueducts, which required the taking of thousands of acres of land through eminent domain. Cemeteries were dug up and relocated. Entire villages were dismantled. Fertile farmland vanished as reservoirs filled.</p>
        <p>In 1996, the city signed an agreement with the watershed communities in which they accepted rigorous anti-pollution regulations in return for payments to help spur nonpolluting development.</p>
        <p>The agreement averted a threatened federal order for the city to build a $6 billion filtration plant to clean water from its most distant, and most important, reservoirs, in the rural Catskills and the Delaware River Valley. This branch of the system supplies 90 percent of the city's water.</p>
        <p>The city has already agreed to filter water from the 10 reservoirs in Westchester and Putnam Counties, which are surrounded by crowded suburbs and thus are more vulnerable to pollution.</p>
        <p>Parts of the show, in photographs and etchings from various archives, reveal the hidden underpinnings of the system -- the networks of vast subterranean tunnels and chambers -- as well as its most conspicuous structures, the dams, many of which were built by Irish masons who lived in guarded camps lest they disturb nearby communities.</p>
        <p>One piece in the show, ''Midden'' by Alex McFarlane, echoes the recondite anatomy of the city water supply and also hints at the sometimes harmful impact of industry on the land. A broad canvas depicts a golden, hilly landscape, but is pierced by graphite elbows of pipe and plumbing. Beneath some of these pipes, dark stains mar the otherwise pastoral tableau.</p>
        <p>Several works focus on the fragile nature of an unfiltered water supply, attempting to illustrate or -- in one instance -- replicate how marshes, bogs, and the rushing tumble of fast-moving streams naturally filter impurities and potentially harmful bacteria.</p>
        <p>The fragility arises from the fact that those same bogs, marshes and chilly streams are among the first elements of a water system to be degraded under the advance of suburban-style development, said Eliza Cooney, the curator of the show.</p>
        <p>''As we pave over wetlands, there's less area to clean the water,'' Ms. Cooney said.</p>
        <p>The trickling sound in the galleries comes from ''Utterance,'' a large sculpture that is an ecosystem itself -- consisting of a moss-covered, tongue-shaped piece of volcanic rock emerging from a wall and drooping over a pool in which fish and plants grow.</p>
        <p>Water seeps down the surface of the tongue across the living moss, then drips into the pool, from which it is pumped upward to repeat the cycle.</p>
        <p>Its creator, Jackie Brookner, an artist from Manhattan, said the piece, which was designed with the help of biologists, acts as a natural pollution filter.</p>
        <p>She said the piece is essentially a microcosm of a watershed, illustrating the links between water quality and living things -- including people.</p>
        <p>''The really important thing to realize is that nothing can be understood in isolation,'' Ms. Brookner said.</p>
        <p>''The water really can't be understood in isolation from soil and the plants that grow on the soil. It's all part of one system ecologically.</p>
        <p>''The human tongue shape is meant to show that we really are part of that system. We tend to think of ourselves above it, or dominating it. That's an illusion. We're very much dependent on it and I think we'll be learning that in the very near future.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Cooney pointed out how the show also reflects the many other benefits that come when the hills that supply drinking water are preserved.</p>
        <p>''A side effect of protecting the surrounding lands from development or pollution is that you're preserving nature,'' she said. And this, in turn, provides an unspoiled environment that can be enjoyed by hikers, bird watchers or people like Ms. Free who simply enjoy driving past something other than a condo complex or mini-mall on the way to work.</p>
        <p>Clean water also results in abundant fish. Mr. Thiesing's pieces deal with the finny inhabitants of the streams and reservoirs, which, he said, serve as a living barometer of the system's health -- and also provide a source of recreation for hundreds of fly casters and anglers who prowl the water supply each year.</p>
        <p>Many of his paintings show the world from a fish's point of view, with an angler visible above a trout as a wavy, vague figure peering down through the surface.</p>
        <p>''I see this world every day, I take care of it, I protect it,'' Mr. Thiesing said, ''My goal is to translate that beauty through my art and educate people about what they drive by every day.''</p>
        <p>Besides showing the beauty of water in its natural state, the show points out the darker possibilities, should the city and its upstate partners fail to keep the reservoirs clean.</p>
        <p>Michael Phelan, a young artist from Manhattan whose work was recently featured at the Whitney Museum, contributed a piece that consists of a wall of water -- a stack of 41 Poland Springs water-cooler jugs, which on a recent afternoon glowed sapphire blue as sunlight from a nearby window illuminated them from behind.</p>
        <p>The title is simply ''4,032 Cups of Water.''</p>
        <p>If the resource is neglected, Ms. Cooney said, future generations may only recognize water when it comes encased in plastic.</p>
        <p>Tagging Along With 'Unbottled'</p>
        <p>SEVERAL special programs have been planned in connection with the ''Unbottled'' exhibition. All of the events are scheduled from 1 p.m. to 2:30 p.m. on the following dates, all Saturdays.</p>
        <p>JUNE 3 -- ''Look Into the Brook.'' Participants will examine insect larvae and other benthic micro invertebrates (translation: animals without backbones invisible to the naked eye) collected from nearby Titicus River. They will compare the number and types of animals with those obtained from a pond near the museum.</p>
        <p>JUNE 10 -- ''Something Fishy.'' Participants will study the fish of the Croton Reservoir System and create clay sculptures under the guidance of Paul Thiesing, an artist and watershed inspector.</p>
        <p>JUNE 24 -- ''What's a Limnologist?'' The subject is the work of the scientists who study fresh-water lakes, ponds, streams and the life they sustain.</p>
        <p>JUNE 24 -- ''Wetlands in Your Watershed.'' A discussion of wetlands will focus on Titicus Reservoir Watershed, including a demonstration of wetland plants and cores of wetland soil. Participants will learn the best, and worst, plants to cultivate in a wet garden.</p>
        <p>The Hammond Museum and Japanese Stroll Garden, on Deveau Road in North Salem, is open from noon to 4 p.m. Wednesdays through Saturdays. Admission for nonmembers is $4, $3 for those with senior-citizen identification; children under 12 are admitted free.</p>
