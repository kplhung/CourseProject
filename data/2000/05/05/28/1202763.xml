        <p>Never Mind Nirvana</p>
        <p>By Mark Lindquist.</p>
        <p>Villard, $21.95.</p>
        <p>Books that draw on the richness of pop culture can be pure delight, or they can be too taken with their own cleverness to make much of an impression. Mark Lindquist's third novel, ''Never Mind Nirvana,'' falls somewhere in the middle. Sometimes it wears its hipness a little too boldly: there are times when its setting (Seattle) and its recurring references to Seattle bands past and present (Nirvana among them, of course) make it seem too much like an insider's book, a novel for people who know all the right names and all the cool places. But even so, Lindquist's story of Pete Tyler, a 36-year-old rock fan and former musician who's having trouble growing up despite his solid job (he's a deputy prosecutor), has enough heart to make it occasionally touching, and very often entertaining. Pete, like the main character in Nick Hornby's ''High Fidelity,'' is painfully lonely, yet he just can't commit to one woman: he's falling hard for the smart and beguiling Esme, but he still has feelings for Winter, the stripper he occasionally sleeps with. For solace he turns to music, which of course doesn't solve his problems. But like Hornby, Lindquist understands how easily and how imperceptibly pop music can weave itself into one's everyday life, enriching it in both tiny ways and big ones. What's more, Lindquist deftly walks the fine line between having compassion for Pete and simply indulging his postadolescent nonsense. ''Pete's most interesting experiences, his most intense experiences, his few transcendent experiences, have almost all involved women or music -- music &amp; women = truth &amp; beauty -- and he feels justified in pursuing women with senseless passion because he does not know what life ought to be if not the pursuit of experiences and connections that elevate us, at least for a few moments.'' It's a confused statement, but it's a heartfelt one. Pete may not have it all figured out yet, but without sentimentality or excessive hand-wringing, Lindquist opens up the possibility that he just might.</p>
