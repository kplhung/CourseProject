        <p>ENGLISH PASSENGERS</p>
        <p>By Matthew Kneale.</p>
        <p>446 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Nan A. Talese/Doubleday. $25.</p>
        <p>WHAT draws writers to historical settings? Sometimes they offer terrain where great moral issues seem to stand in more stark relief than they do in our own high-speed time of information overload, consumer culture and the Internet. The horror of slavery, for example, is at the center of novels like Barry Unsworth's ''Sacred Hunger'' or Charles Johnson's ''Middle Passage.'' At first glance, something similar seems to have impelled the English writer Matthew Kneale to set his ambitious fourth novel, ''English Passengers,'' in a time and place of mass murder. Surprisingly, however, the book is often hilarious.</p>
        <p>''English Passengers'' takes place mostly in 19th-century Tasmania, scene of the most complete and perhaps least known of colonial genocides. After the British took over the island as a site for penal settlements to supplement those in nearby Australia, war, disease and systematic murder by soldiers and bounty hunters wiped out the indigenous Tasmanians. When a woman named Truganini died in 1876, not a single full-blooded Tasmanian aborigine was left alive.</p>
        <p>This devastation is the background for a novel that is unusual in form. Spanning some four decades, the story is told entirely in the first person by about 20 characters. One strand of action begins in England in 1857, as an expedition financed by an eccentric philanthropist sets out for Tasmania. Its organizer is the Rev. Geoffrey Wilson, who wants to confute the Darwinist heretics by proving that the island is the location of the Garden of Eden. The expedition's other principal is Dr. Thomas Potter, a physician convinced that races have predetermined character types. He is ostensibly signed on for the Garden of Eden search, but his real aim is collecting the skulls that will prove his theories. ''Weaker nations (e.g. black, Indian, Oriental, Norman etc. etc.) will be swept away. New era will begin,'' he writes in his journal.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, another strand of the plot starts in Tasmania some years earlier, as ambitious British colonial officials, escaped convicts and diminishing bands of aborigines vie for power on the island. This is a sad tale of suffering, rape, murder and the misguided efforts of a paternalistic do-gooder (modeled on a real person, George Robinson, who tried to save, clothe and Christianize the aborigines). Much of it is told by Peevay, member of an aborigine band. It is no easy job for a novelist to imagine himself into the head of a Stone Age hunter-gatherer. Kneale's Peevay is an earnest, admirable, good-hearted try, but does not fully come alive. This element of the story feels a touch tedious.</p>
        <p>Someone who does live and breathe on the page, however, and who totally steals the show is Illiam Quillian Kewley, from the Isle of Man, captain of the chartered ship bringing the first set of characters to Tasmania. To impress British customs officials, Kewley has hung his ship's dining cabin with portraits of Queen Victoria's children, but secretly he is rooting for the ''Hindoos'' who are at this moment causing Her Majesty so much trouble with the Indian Mutiny. For, unknown to the Eden-dazed clergyman and the skull-obsessed Dr. Potter, Kewley's Sincerity is a smuggler's vessel. Hidden trapdoors beneath busts of Victoria and Albert open into the space between the ship's carefully constructed double hulls, a space filled with brandy, tobacco and French pornographic paintings.</p>
        <p>All along the lengthy voyage from England to Tasmania, the Sincerity makes sudden departures from odd ports of call. As the ship sails away from one dock, the puzzled passengers notice some unidentified men rush onto the pier and shake their fists at the departing vessel. ''Well-wishers,'' explains Captain Kewley enigmatically, and he and the crew cheerfully wave back at the distant figures. Kewley and his men are urgently trying to sell their lucrative contraband and some fancy silverware, to which they have helped themselves at an admiral's house. But they are always barely one step ahead of pursuing coast guard cutters and policemen. A last-minute mishap intervenes each time they think they have a buyer.</p>
        <p>Wilson and Potter, their minds on their respective quests, have no idea what's going on. ''There's no missing a breeze like this,'' the chief mate explains, abruptly hustling his passengers on board when there's barely any wind. Sometimes it is unexpected ''currents'' or the alleged need to buy a new ship's clock that determines the Sincerity's erratic itinerary. In response, Potter ascribes the apparent capriciousness of the ship's Manx crew to their ''Celtic'' skulls; Wilson dimly suspects some sort of sin is involved. Wilson and Potter are still in the dark even when the crew frantically chases an Australian wombat that gets between the double hulls and begins literally eating into their potential profits.</p>
        <p>As a whole, ''English Passengers'' feels a bit too much like two separate novels, because one stream of its action is essentially foreordained and tragic, the other unpredictable and comic. The two streams do ultimately flow together. Then they separate and conclude; the ship-of-fools strand of the plot has a particularly satisfying finish when Dr. Potter meets the end he deserves, one deliciously appropriate to his quest for specimens. But Captain Kewley alone is worth the price of admission, as he bribes and connives his way around the world, always looking for fellow Manx seamen who can tip him off as to where he might finally make the elusive deal of his dreams.</p>
        <p>Although the captain does not seem to be modeled on any historical personage, he is, paradoxically, more alive than the several characters who are. Kneale seems to know that in Kewley he has drawn his best portrait, because he appends to the book an Anglo-Manx glossary to be sure we don't miss anything the captain is saying. We don't need a glossary, however, any more than we need one for Lewis Carroll's ''Jabberwocky'' (to which the Anglo-Manx dialect, incidentally, seems to bear some resemblance). When Kewley calls one of his enemies a ''sleetchy old scraper. . . . Fat muck of a fritlag. Big slug, all sitting on his shillings with his little crab of a wife, snurly and high,'' we get the idea. Kewley is, as he at one point says of someone else, ''a different pair of oars entirely,'' and one that makes the book worth reading.</p>
