        <p>ALMOST nine years ago, Carlos Daniel Grullon confronted his estranged wife in the basement of the Tarrytown Hilton Inn, where she worked as a chambermaid. Believing she had dishonored him by her independent behavior, he shot her twice, the police said.</p>
        <p>His wife, Yolina Arcenia Camacho, died at the scene, and Mr. Grullon became a fugitive, fleeing to the protection of his homeland, the Dominican Republic.</p>
        <p>Despite repeated requests for his extradition, Mr. Grullon remains there, protected, in part, by a weak judicial system and cultural biases, which tolerate so-called ''honor killings,'' a form of culturally sanctioned murder by husbands who believe their wives have disrespected them, United States and United Nations officials said.</p>
        <p>Detective Sgt. Gene Buonanno of the Tarrytown Police Department learned of those cultural biases early in the investigation.</p>
        <p>In his initial discussions with the Dominican authorities, Detective Buonanno said he was told that ''in some cases, murdering one's wife might be justifiable.''</p>
        <p>''We said: 'Justifiable? What cases would that be?' '' he recalled. The official replied that in the Dominican Republic, if a wife discredits the husband, killing her would be allowed.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to accept that the man committed murder here and can leave to a protective country,'' Detective Buonanno said. ''He's like a hero over there.''</p>
        <p>Since he fled, the authorities said, Mr. Grullon has threatened to kill his two children, Dahiana, now 14, and Richard, now 10, who live with their maternal grandmother in Sleepy Hollow, and has harassed his wife's family in the Dominican Republic.</p>
        <p>The United States Ambassador to the Dominican Republic, Charles T. Manatt, has ''spoken out about the issue, calling for his immediate arrest,'' an embassy spokeswoman, Sophie Folly, said.</p>
        <p>Until recently, however, none of this has moved the Dominican officials to extradite Mr. Grullon.</p>
        <p>But in early February the House International Relations Committee, headed by Representative Benjamin A. Gilman, a Republican from Tarrytown, cut off $6.1 million in aid to the Dominican Republic until Mr. Grullon is extradited. Much of that aid was earmarked for judicial reform.</p>
        <p>Since then, activity surrounding the case has picked up. In late February, Mr. Grullon was tried in absentia by a Dominican court and found guilty of murdering his wife and of bail violations, and he was sentenced to 30 years in prison. Mr. Grullon, however, remains at large.</p>
        <p>The Dominican Ambassador to the United States, Roberto B. Saladin Selin, said, ''All the judicial power of the Dominican Republic and the national police are doing all the necessary efforts to capture Mr. Grullon and put him in jail.''</p>
        <p>But his conviction in the Dominican Republic has complicated the chances of extradition to the United States, Mr. Selin said.</p>
        <p>Regional judicial and law enforcement authorities in the Dominican Republic are independent of the national goverment, he explained. And while Mr. Selin insists that the Dominican Republic, ''will not be a refuge for these criminals,'' the regional court of Moca, where Mr. Grullon was tried, will be given the chance to excercise its authority first.</p>
        <p>''Regional judicial power and law enforcement are independent authorities, and it's up to them to put him in jail,'' Mr. Selin said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Camacho was 22 when she arrived in this country with her two children in 1990. From the outset, her sister, Ana Garafolo, said, she tried to give them a better life. She worked two jobs and attended night school to improve her English.</p>
        <p>Six months later, Ms. Camacho returned to the Dominican Republic to marry Mr. Grullon, her high school sweetheart and the father of her children. On March 22, 1991, Mr. Grullon arrived in New York and moved in with Ms. Camacho, who was living with her parents, Amado and Juana Camacho, in Sleepy Hollow.</p>
        <p>Ms. Camacho arranged a job for him, but a family member said Mr. Grullon, a truck driver, did not like the work schedule. He lost his job, and relations between the couple started to deteriorate, Ms. Camacho's sisters said.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Camacho asked Mr. Grullon to leave, they said, he refused and threatened to kill the whole family.</p>
        <p>Despite incidents of domestic violence, Ms. Camacho would not seek help from the police because of the respect she had for Mr. Grullon's mother and father.</p>
        <p>''She didn't want to embarrass them,'' Mrs. Garafolo said.</p>
        <p>''And she kept thinking he would change. She always trusted him until the end.''</p>
        <p>Ruchira Gupta, a consultant to the United Nations on violence against women, believes that Ms. Camacho was the victim of an honor killing.</p>
        <p>Such killings are typically found only in developing countries. But more and more women from these societies are migrating to developed nations. As they gain independence from their husbands, they challenge the traditional attitudes and roles played by the men in their families, Ms. Gupta said. As a result, honor killings are spreading.</p>
        <p>Whether Mr. Grullon believed his wife had disgraced him or felt an overwhelming frustration trying to adapt to life in the United States, Ms. Gupta said, he felt his honor was at stake. And, in these societies, she said, ''a man has the right to have the life of his woman.''</p>
        <p>To Jeanine Pirro, the Westchester district attorney, the term ''honor killing'' is irrelevant.</p>
        <p>''You can term a killing anything you want,'' she said. ''What matters is the law of the country where the murder occurs.''</p>
        <p>She said she was prepared to prosecute Mr. Grullon as soon as he is extradited because ''a dead mother is the issue here.''</p>
        <p>She added, ''No honor code should be used as an excuse to get away with murder.''</p>
        <p>The stress of the last nine years is obvious on the faces of Ms. Camacho's mother and sisters as they sit in the cramped nursery of Mrs. Garafolo's home.</p>
        <p>Tears stream down their faces when they recount the steps the Tarrytown police have taken to bring Mr. Grullon to justice.</p>
        <p>Juana Camacho, the victim's mother, is now raising Ms. Camacho's children. Immediately after their mother's murder, they were put in foster homes and hidden for two years because of the death threats Mr. Grullon made. They could only visit their mother's family for 30 minutes every week in a protected, neutral location.</p>
        <p>Richard, 10, is coping from day to day. In front of his classmates, he calls Mrs. Garafolo his ''mamy.'' They say Dahiana, 14, is at the age where she needs her mother.</p>
        <p>Wiping tears from her eyes, Ms. Camacho's sister Fiordaliza says the worst times are family gatherings when an unbearable sadness hangs in the air. ''When we are all together,'' she said, ''something is missing.''</p>
        <p>The Camacho family has heard that Mr. Grullon has repeatedly changed his appearance over the last nine years, but they say they would know him anywhere. ''I want to see him in court,'' Fiordaliza Camacho said. ''I want to see those eyes over here.''</p>
