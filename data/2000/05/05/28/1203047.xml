        <p>THE official announcement took no one by surprise: Ford said last week that it would bring back the Thunderbird, this time as a two-seat roadster closely modeled on a concept car that was a sensation at auto shows last year.</p>
        <p>The 2002 T-Bird, which goes into production early next year, will pick up where the 1955-57 left off. For '58, the T-Bird became a larger, heavier four-seat car, and in later years it grew bloated and overwrought. But Ford says the next-generation T-Bird is a modern interpretation of the original, complete with turquoise emblems and porthole windows in the removable hardtop.</p>

        <p>THE official announcement took no one by surprise: Ford said last week that it would bring back the Thunderbird, this time as a two-seat roadster closely modeled on a concept car that was a sensation at auto shows last year.</p>
        <p>The 2002 T-Bird, which goes into production early next year, will pick up where the 1955-57 left off. For '58, the T-Bird became a larger, heavier four-seat car, and in later years it grew bloated and overwrought. But Ford says the next-generation T-Bird is a modern interpretation of the original, complete with turquoise emblems and porthole windows in the removable hardtop.</p>
        <p>To stir up interest in the new car, even though dealers have not begun to take orders, Ford is kicking off a summerlong T-bird-watching contest that will culminate in a giveaway of three original models.</p>
        <p>Starting this weekend in metropolitan New York, Southern California and South Florida, three white mid-50's roadsters will drive through 144 communities. People who spot one of the cars -- they wear decals identifying them as part of Ford's American Dream Car Tour -- can register to win one. Entries can be made over the Internet at www.fordvehicles.com or by mail at Dream Car, Box 1955, Young America, Minn. 55594; entrants should provide the day, city and approximate location where they saw one of the special cars. Winners are to be announced in October.</p>
        <p>Price guides put the value of 1955-57 models -- the favorites of collectors -- at $16,000 to $50,000. The '02 model, which will use the rear-drive chassis and V-8 engine of the Lincoln LS sedan, is expected to start around $35,000.</p>
