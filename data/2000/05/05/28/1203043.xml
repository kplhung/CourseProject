        <p>Dr. Michele A. Miller, an archaeologist, and Matthew A. Miller, a lawyer, are to be married this evening at Idlehour, a former Vanderbilt home in Oakdale, N.Y. Rabbi Ephraim Wolf is to officiate.</p>
        <p>The bride, 32, is the director of fund-raising for the Poetry Society of America, in New York. She is also a co-director of art objects and jewelry excavations at a Neolithic site at Shaar Hagolan, Israel. She received a bachelor's degree and also a master's degree in anthropology from Stanford University, and holds a doctorate in archaeology from Boston University.</p>
        <p>Her parents, Elaine Miller and Dr. Albert Miller, live in Great Neck, N.Y., where her mother practices family law. The bride's father is the director of pulmonary medicine, in Brooklyn and Queens for St. Vincents Catholic Medical Centers. He is also a professor of clinical medicine at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx and a professor of community medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom, 31, is a vice president in the legal department at Viacom, the media company in Manhattan. He graduated magna cum laude from the State University at Albany and received a law degree from Boston University. His parents, Aline F. Miller and Jerome E. Miller, live in Albany, where his mother is a receptionist in a doctor's office and his father is an independent sales representative, supplying educational books and computer software to local schools.</p>
        <p>The couple met two years ago, when a mutual friend suggested to Matthew Miller, an amateur archaeologist, that he call Dr. Miller. He asked her to meet him for dinner so they could discuss such subjects as Neolithic pottery and jewelry.</p>
        <p>''He didn't call me as a guy asking a girl out on a date,'' she recalled. ''He wanted to meet me and talk about archaeology. I brought brochures from our excavation, and he was asking me really intelligent questions.''</p>
        <p>Three months after they met, Mr. Miller visited Dr. Miller on a dig in Israel, where he helped out on the site.</p>
        <p>He says he fell in love with her on that trip, especially with her enthusiasm and overall grittiness while working in the heat. ''I always pictured directors of digs sitting on a mound nearby, smoking their cigars and looking cute in their archaeological outfits, but Michelle was in there shoveling with everyone else,'' Mr. Miller said.</p>
        <p>He added that the bare-bones, difficult circumstances of the dig made for a good relationship test. ''If you love her when you wake up at 4 a.m., and after digging for 8 hours in the 110-degree Israel sun, it must be right,'' he said.</p>
