        <p>George Olsen, letter, responds to Fred Brock's May 7 article on 'silent' generation, those Americans, now in the mid-50's to early 70's, who are too young to have fought in World War II but too old to be considered baby boomers; drawing (M)</p>

        <p>In ''The Silent Generation Seeks Its Due (May 7)'' Fred Brock looked at Americans who are too young to have fought in World War II but too old to be considered baby boomers. Members of that age group, in their mid-50's to early 70's, often feel overlooked by employers, marketers and the popular culture.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am 55 years old. I graduated from college in 1966 and received my draft notice when my college deferment ran out.  But instead of being drafted in the Army I joined the Marine Corps with two fraternity brothers. We all went to OCS at Quantico, Va. and in November 1967 I was in Vietnam as an infantry platoon commander.</p>

        <p>I am 55 years old. I graduated from college in 1966 and received my draft notice when my college deferment ran out.

        <p>(Depending how you quantify combat, I saw quite a bit of action with the Tet</p>
        <p>offensive, etc.) I was always resentful of my friends and others who had a head start on their careers and I felt I lost 10 years because of the war. But, I had an  opportunity they didn't, to evaluate what I really wanted to do at a later age then my peers, and therefore was able to better choose my career path and goals from a more mature perspective. I am very happy with my life.</p>
