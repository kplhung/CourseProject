        <p>FRESH herbs are now available year round, but I can't help associating them with certain seasons.</p>
        <p>Basil suggests summer, rosemary, winter and fall. Tarragon is the herb for spring.</p>
        <p>Tarragon has a subtle but pronounced taste, which goes well with foods we associate with spring: salmon, chicken, veal, rabbit, eggs and baby vegetables like artichokes, fava beans, asparagus and carrots.</p>
        <p>Leaves of tarragon inserted under the skin of a chicken before it is roasted permeate the flesh with its flavor. Salmon, which is rich and fatty, goes wonderfully with tarragon, which has a faint anise aroma that complements the fish. Waxy fingerlings or new potatoes make a delicious warm salad tossed with a tarragon-vinegar dressing.</p>
        <p>''There is no good vinegar without tarragon,'' the elder Alexandre Dumas wrote. You can make your own by putting a few fresh sprigs into a bottle of white-wine vinegar.</p>
        <p>Tarragon is a powerful herb, and it should be used in moderation. If you put in too much, it can be overwhelming.</p>
        <p>I only use it fresh. Most herbs are stronger when dried, but tarragon loses an essential oil and tends to fade out of the picture. You have to put in twice as much as you would fresh and even then the result isn't the same.</p>
        <p>Roast Chicken With Tarragon  Total time: 50 minutes</p>
        <p>1 3-to-4-pound chicken  About  1/2-cup tarragon leaves, loosely packed  Half a lemon  Olive oil or duck fat  Coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. Wipe the chicken dry with paper towels. Insert the tarragon leaves under chicken skin over the breast and legs. (Do this by pushing your finger underneath and gently making a pocket for the leaves without ripping the skin). Put the lemon in the cavity of the chicken. Brush the chicken with oil and season to taste with salt and pepper and truss it.</p>
        <p>2. Roast without opening the oven door if possible for 40 minutes. The  chicken is done when the juices run clear and yellow and the leg moves easily in the socket. Allow it to rest for five minutes before serving.  Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Artichokes and Tarragon With Grilled Salmon  Total time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons extra-virgin oil  4 fillets salmon, 5 to 6 ounces  Coarse sea salt and freshly ground white pepper to taste  2 pounds baby artichokes  2 tablespoons lemon juice  1 clove garlic, minced  2 teaspoons chopped fresh tarragon  4 lemon quarters.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat grill or broiler. Rub the oil into the salmon on both sides and sprinkle with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>2. Slice the tops off the artichokes about one-third the way down and discard them. Trim the outer leaves and the stalks. As you trim each artichoke, put it in a bowl of cold water with the lemon juice. This will help stop it from turning brown.</p>
        <p>3. Slice the artichokes vertically in thin slices. Dry in a spin dryer or with paper towels. Heat the remaining olive oil in a large frying pan. Saute the artichokes with the garlic until they are golden brown. Season to taste with salt and pepper and toss with the tarragon. Keep them warm in a low oven.</p>
        <p>4. Meanwhile, put the salmon on the grill skin side up and grill seven to eight minutes for medium rare, turning after four minutes. Put the fish on four individual plates and sprinkle with the artichokes. Garnish with lemon quarters are serve.  Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Fingerling Potato Salad With Tarragon  Total time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>2 pounds fingerling potatoes  1 teaspoon Dijon mustard  2 to 3 tablespoons tarragon vinegar</p>
        <p>1/4 cup safflower oil</p>
        <p>1/2 cup olive oil  Coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste  2 tablespoons chopped tarragon leaves.</p>
        <p>1. Boil or steam the potatoes until they are tender but not falling apart, about 10 to 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, combine the mustard, vinegar and oils to make a smooth emulsion. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>3. Drain the potatoes and slice them into a serving bowl. Coat them with the dressing and gently fold in the tarragon leaves without breaking the potatoes. Correct seasoning and serve warm or at room temperature.  Yield: 4 servings.</p>
