        <p>WE decided not to compete for a summer rental in the Hamptons this year. All the best properties have already been grabbed by the nouveau riche dot-com crowd, who have wisely decided to dance as hard as they can before the music stops. The only places now on the market are small rooms in shared houses, at about $10,000, and tiny cottages with teacup-size pools for a mere $25,000 a season. The rich may have more money than you and me, but they will have less living space than well-fed battery chickens.</p>
        <p>All the regular inhabitants of the Hamptons abandon their homes from Memorial Day to Labor Day to take advantage of this summer bonanza. They sit in modest ranch houses in Coram or Mineola ($950 a month), counting the profits and wishing that the season would go on forever.</p>
        <p>This will be the 17th straight year that we have failed to rent a summer house in the Hamptons. We live so close that it seems ridiculous to go to such expense. If we had a helicopter, we could fly to East Hampton in about 15 minutes from our home in Wading River. And it's an easy drive, by way of Riverhead and Montauk Highway. On a summer weekend, we can start out early on Friday morning and arrive just in time for lunch on Saturday.</p>
        <p>The more you browse through the brochures and travel supplements, the more appealing a summer rental seems. The houses all sound delightful, as if living in one of them for a few weeks might change one's life. Many offer an ''EIK,'' an eat-in kitchen, at no extra cost. This feature appeals especially to New Yorkers, who can eat in their tiny apartment kitchens only if they are completely alone, and stand upright with their arms held tightly by their sides.</p>
        <p>But, wait a minute; we can eat in our kitchen. The cats do it all the time. The more I studied the ads, the more these pricey rentals began to sound just like home. ''Secluded, quiet, skylights, deck, English garden, quiet neighborhood, deck, near the ocean, cable TV, all appliances. . .'' We could have an authentic summer rental experience by staying right here.</p>
        <p>Our house does lack three of the essential features promoted in the classified ads: a cathedral ceiling, a swimming pool and a full-sized tennis court. But what can you do with a cathedral ceiling? Let balloons float up into it? As for tennis, it's bad for my back. And we get all the pool atmosphere we need from the people next door, who have a big one. We can sit, warm and dry, on our deck and enjoy the sound effects as they splash, and choke on chlorine, try to repair the pump and scream about the icy water. This is infinitely more relaxing that getting wet ourselves.</p>
        <p>Our summer place may not be right on the beach. But if sunstroke, boredom and long-term skin damage are your idea of a good time, no place on Long Island is very far from a beach. The state park beach, about five minutes away, is broad and beautiful, but a bit stony. If we absolutely must sit on pure, soft sand, all we have to do is dig down a foot or two in the backyard, and there's a perfect beach right under the bed of perennials. When we are not on the beach, we can skate around the subdivision, talking loudly into our cellular phones, like regular Hamptons folks.</p>
        <p>We can sit out and drink Californian champagne cocktails on a warm evening, and easily imitate the gaudy extravagances of Hamptons cuisine with ingredients from King Kullen, but without the snobbish service or the outrageous prices. At night, we can send ourselves to sleep watching some of the most obscure movies on the planet, dubbed from Japanese into Croatian, and rented from a catalog designed for insomniac intellectuals with severe depression. There's no more culturally correct entertainment to be found anywhere on the South Fork.</p>
        <p>Only two things are missing from our summer paradise: sophisticated shopping and celebrity parties.</p>
        <p>Our local stores are not at the cutting edge of the retail revolution. We don't have a Laura Ashley or even a Starbucks. The dry cleaner and the pharmacy are only slightly interesting, and our few antique stores are stocked with junk and bric-a-brac.</p>
        <p>And we are seriously short of celebrities. I read that Billy Joel was moving to the North Fork, but he hasn't come to Wading River. If we want to enjoy a summer whirl of celebrity parties, we'll just have to widen our definition of the glitterati. For example, the folks who organize our annual Duck Pond Day are pretty famous around here; we have some distant but distinguished relatives of the early settlers; a man who made a documentary film about tent caterpillars; a high school football star; even a New York Times columnist. This should be enough for a celebrity party. We could even make it on to the social page of our local free paper, if it had a social page.</p>
        <p>Our summer in Wading River begins this weekend, with 15 weeks of sun and fun ahead. But we will still consider an offer, in six figures, for our unique summer rental. We would have to find alternative accommodation, of course. But here's a modest, 10,000-square-foot cottage on the beach at East Hampton, with an Olympic-sized pool and three Jacuzzis. If the price is right, we are willing to make the sacrifice and move down there for the season. Nobody can accuse us of being prejudiced.</p>
