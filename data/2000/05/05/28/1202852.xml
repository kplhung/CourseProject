        <p>IT is 6:30 p.m., and there isn't an empty seat at St. Paul's Catholic Church at the church's busiest service on the holiest day of the year. Father Javiar Diaz, reading from a Bible written in Spanish, gives the Easter Mass while hymns are accompanied by Mexican guitars.</p>
        <p>The parishioners -- many dressed in worn jeans and mud-stained sweatshirts -- line the pews at the stolid brick church on Nassau Street. They come from places like Oaxaca, Mexico; Santa Rosa, Guatemala; and Havana, Cuba.</p>
        <p>There weren't always standing-room-only crowds at St. Paul's. Two years ago, only a third of the pews were filled on Easter Sunday. And less than a decade ago, there was no Spanish-language Mass at all.</p>
        <p>''This is a growing community, one with many needs,'' Father Diaz said. ''They are people who work very much and make very little. The majority don't have social security or medical security. Yet they pay their taxes, because they have enough problems in their lives.''</p>
        <p>It is in church that Hispanic immigrants find the pervasive Roman Catholic culture they left behind, one in which the priest and the church are the center of private and community life.</p>
        <p>The crowd at the service is just one reflection of the recent flood of Hispanic immigrants to central New Jersey, one that immigration experts say rivals the great wave of European migration of the late 19th century. And Newark International Airport, where about 55,423 international flights land each year, has replaced Ellis Island as the port of entry.</p>
        <p>From Bound Brook to New Brunswick to Princeton, the state's Hispanic communities are larger and more vibrant than ever before. The United States Census Bureau says the state's Hispanic population grew to more than a million people in 1999 from 739,861 in 1990.</p>
        <p>More startling, perhaps, is the bureau's prediction that Hispanics will surpass blacks as the largest minority group in the state by 2004. Puerto Ricans and Cubans now make up the largest Hispanic groups in the state, though most immigrants in the last five years have come from Central and South America.</p>
        <p>''We are going through the second great wave of immigration in the history of this country,'' said James Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers. ''New Jersey has always been an immigration gateway, and it is getting a large share of what is a far more heterogeneous immigration boom.''</p>
        <p>As was the case in the late 19th century, when European migration underpinned the rise of New Jersey's urban manufacturing economy, most of today's immigrants are drawn by the prospect of better-paying jobs in towns like Princeton, where help-wanted signs are ubiquitous.</p>
        <p>The boom in central New Jersey's economy has been fueled by the growth of electronic, biotech and information industries. Indeed, Route 1 has become a busy corridor of steel and glass office parks; and to the west, a number of luxury housing developments have helped the ''Wealth Belt'' earn its nickname.</p>
        <p>With such prosperity, professionals in the area have more money than ever, and unemployment in the state is below 4 percent. As a result, service-level jobs in kitchens, automobile repair shops and landscaping companies are abundant in an area where Mercedes Benzes and BMW's are almost as common as stop signs.</p>
        <p>But with so many opportunities, there are also major risks. Practically all of the undocumented immigrants seized by the Immigration and Naturalization Service will be sent back to the countries they came from, losing the investment of many years' wages to make the journey.</p>
        <p>So far 38-year-old Pedro Sanchez Rodriguez, who has been here for less than a month, has not yet found a job. No reason to worry, though said Mr. Sanchez, because ''there are many places to work.''</p>
        <p>Instead, he worries about his undocumented status and repaying the relatives who scraped together $3,000 for him to make the journey from Oaxaca, Mexico. He worries about his wife and two children still there, to whom he will send money when he gets some.</p>
        <p>''It was a risk to come here,'' he said in Spanish. ''I don't speak English. I have $20 in my pocket, a friend with a house and the clothes I am wearing. I know there is work, even though I have not found it yet.''</p>
        <p>Lynn Durko, a spokeswoman for the immigration office in Newark, says there are an estimated 143,000 undocumented immigrants in New Jersey, although she cannot not say how many are Hispanic.</p>
        <p>The growth of the Hispanic community in central New Jersey is rooted in several historical processes. Hispanic immigration first became a significant trend in the New York metropolitan area when Puerto Rico became a Commonwealth of the United States in 1952. In addition, the effects of regularized air travel combined with aftermath of the Cuban revolution in the 1950's led to the expansion of Cuban and Puerto Rican neighborhood in North Jersey, most of them in Hudson County.</p>
        <p>In 1965, a revised immigration law gave preference to immigrants seeking to reunify families in the United States, and it increased quotas from non-European countries that in the past had been excluded.</p>
        <p>''At some point by historical accident, these communities provided a comfortable, transitional environment where newcomers felt comfortable,''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hughes said, explaining why Hispanics were drawn to this area. ''You always have newcomers coming to a node and expanding it.''</p>
        <p>In the same way that Union City developed a large Cuban community in the 1950's, towns in central New Jersey like New Brunswick, Hightstown and Bound Brook have recently been the destination of choice for Mexicans and Guatemalans.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the overwhelming majority of these newest immigrants are men. Some are like Mr. Sanchez: heads of households taking a gamble on America. Others are young men seeking a better life.</p>
        <p>Mario Barias, 22, remembers being a migrant farm worker in Guatemala, a country with an annual per capita income of less than $675. ''Depending on the season, we would pick beans, corn and coffee,'' Mr. Barias said. ''It was very difficult.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barias is now cleaning dishes at a restaurant in West Windsor, making the minimum wage of $5.25 per hour.</p>
        <p>''The jobs here are much easier and more relaxed,'' he said. His one regret is that he has not spoken to his parents or brothers since he left his hometown of Santa Rosa four years ago.</p>
        <p>While some new immigrants intend to earn some money and return home, many others come to settle in the United States and start families.</p>
        <p>Less than a mile from Nassau Street's tony boutiques and restaurants one recent night, Flabio Cortez Gonzalez, 30, ate dinner in a parking lot outside the one-bedroom apartment where he lives with his wife, nephew and two children.</p>
        <p>''It's cooler out here,'' he said as he spooned from a bowl of rice, chicken and frijoles.</p>
        <p>Inside, his wife, Venoria Gonzalez Cortez, prepared soft tacos, boiled peppers and grilled chicken. Smells of grease, plantains and burnt cheese hung over the stove. The hot oven inside and relentless heat outside caused Ms. Gonzalez, a native of Oaxaca and no stranger to warm weather, to sweat heavily.</p>
        <p>''We turn the air-conditioner on only when we are sleeping,'' Ms. Gonzalez explained. ''Electricity is very expensive.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cortez says he and his wife can barely afford the rent of $975 a month for the apartment behind a small bodega; he works at a nearby stable, feeding horses and cleaning stalls, and she at a restaurant.</p>
        <p>The apartment is decorated with a giant stuffed Tweety Bird, Porky Pig, and Sylvester the cat. ''The children like them from television,'' Mr. Cortez says.</p>
        <p>Their two children, Flabio, 5, and Lizbeth, 2, are American citizens born in Princeton, where the family hopes to stay because of the highly regarded  public schools.</p>
        <p>Luxury comes in the form of large Sunday-night dinners and three annual trips to the Six Flags amusement park.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cortez says the couple came to the United States in 1988 from Oaxaca ''because of the need to do something with our lives, to have money to buy a house, buy a car and help my parents economically.''</p>
        <p>Not all of New Jersey's newest Hispanic immigrants came merely to tap the employment opportunities on the bottom rung of the ladder. To be sure, engineers, academics and entrepreneurs make a significant portion of the new immigrants, especially since the immigration agency now gives preference to those with high-tech skills.</p>
        <p>A handful of New Jersey companies recruit abroad, and a growing number of Latin American-born people with doctorates are streaming into the New Jersey work force after graduating from Rutgers and Princeton Universities.</p>
        <p>In 1993, the New Jersey Department of Labor reported that a survey had found that 30 percent of the state's Hispanics earned from $25,000 to $50,000 a year, and almost 15 percent earned more than $50,000.</p>
        <p>Indeed, a good number of Hispanic earners chose to start their own businesses. The 11-year-old Statewide Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of New Jersey says it represents 30,000 businesses.</p>
        <p>''Without the Latino entrepreneur, New Jersey's cities would be falling into urban decay,'' said Guillermo Beytagh-Maldonado, the executive director of New Brunswick's Puerto Rican Action Board and a board member of the chamber, which says it represents 30,000 businesses. ''If you go through New Brunswick, you'll see that that Latino entrepreneurs are the owners of the mom-and-pop shops.''</p>
        <p>Many of the state's middle-class Hispanics are second-generation Americans whose immigrant parents had struggled to make ends meet.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Vega, 33, is the vice president of New Brunswick Tomorrow, one of the most active Hispanic community organizations in the state. He remembers how his Peruvian-born mother worked at a Revlon factory in Irvington even though she barely understood English. She encouraged him to study hard, and he became the first in his family to attend college.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Vega, a graduate of Rutgers, is the family's main breadwinner, and he just bought a house in Highland Park that he shares with his mother, sister and nephews, and he regularly sends money to relatives in Peru.</p>
        <p>''It's really the experience of the Latino family in the U.S. that you have somebody who has gone to college, become educated and has a career while the rest of your family still lives somewhat in poverty and is still struggling,'' Mr. Vega said.</p>
        <p>Most economists agree that the influx of immigrants to New Jersey has helped sustain the state's recent economic growth by providing labor in a tight market.</p>
        <p>''We are a labor-short nation and New Jersey is a labor-short state,'' Mr. Hughes said. ''So absent immigration, we'd be in trouble.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''Immigrants push forward the economy through their labor and tax revenue contributions, and immigrants that are both documented and undocumented give to taxes more than they get from government benefits.''</p>
        <p>While their ability to pay taxes has indeed been tapped, their potential political clout has not.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beytagh-Maldonado asserted, ''Hispanics can be a swing vote in close elections nationwide, and it behooves politicians to pay attention to us.''</p>
        <p>Only recently have politicians have taken note of the swelling Hispanic vote in the region, saying that what the community lacked in its ability to donate money to campaigns it made up for in turnout.</p>
        <p>In the 1996 Presidential election, for instance, about 248,000 Hispanics voted in New Jersey, accounting for 7.6 percent of the state's total turnout, the Census Bureau said. The National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials projects that almost 328,000 Hispanics will vote in the 2000 election, comprising about 10.2 percent of the overall turnout.</p>
        <p>Although Hispanics actually have lower voting rates than non-Hispanic groups, the lag is attributed to the fact that the median age for Hispanics in the country is about 26 years, compared with 36 years for non-Hispanics. In addition, noncitizens -- who make up about 25 percent of the Hispanic population -- are not allowed to vote.</p>
        <p>Still, most of the Hispanics who can vote ultimately do.</p>
        <p>''In many cases it is because they left countries where they lost that right, and they are very conscientious of it,'' said Representative Robert Menendez, whose Union City constituency includes a large Cuban population. ''Or they came from countries where political activity is very high. This is where the community has used the power of its votes to maybe offset the power of donations. And it has done that quite significantly.''</p>
        <p>More and more frequently, Hispanics themselves are running for office in the state -- and winning.</p>
        <p>''In 1986, I became the first mayor of Hispanic descent in the state's history,'' Mr. Menendez said. ''Now you have several Hispanic mayors. Where I was the only Hispanic legislator in the state at one time, you have now five and literally dozens who are councilmen. In less than a decade, you've gone from one in all those categories to something like 30 to 40. There may be even more.''</p>
        <p>As the November election draws near -- at stake is the presidency, a Senate seat and the House seats -- the ability to woo the Hispanic vote will be crucial.</p>
        <p>''Hispanics are becoming a real focus for political actors on both sides of the aisle,'' Governor Whitman said in a recent interview, citing a growing number of Latino political action groups in the state.</p>
        <p>Although politicians are beginning to seek out Hispanic voters, financing of programs to improve their plight has been slow to come.</p>
        <p>''We are contributing to society more than we get out,'' said Mr. Beytagh-Maldonado.</p>
        <p>In 1994, the Urban Institute, a research organization in Washington issued a report, ''Immigrants and Immigration, Setting the Record Straight,'' which said that for every dollar a recent immigrant pays in taxes, he or she receive 37 cents in government benefits.</p>
        <p>Over all, it said, annual taxes paid by immigrants to all levels of government offset the costs of services received, generating a net annual surplus of $25 billion $30 billion.</p>
        <p>Most federal and state social services are not available to noncitizens, even to those who are in the country legally. Part of the problem is that the government cannot provide services to populations that it does not officially acknowledge.</p>
        <p>Hispanic community leaders charge that in 1990 the census undercounted Hispanics, and because of that that funds allocated for community programs are insufficient.</p>
        <p>''There were a lot more than 700,000 in 1990, and there's a lot more then a million now,'' said Mr. Beytagh-Maldonado. ''There is a major undercount problem.''</p>
        <p>Even though the census bureau has invested tens of millions of dollars in advertisements encouraging Hispanics to fill out census forms, Mr. Beytagh-Maldonado said he was concerned that an undercount of Hispanics in 2000 was inevitable. ''Many are here undocumented, and they won't allow themselves to be counted,'' he said.</p>
        <p>New Jersey's Center for Hispanic Policy, Research and Development, which was founded in 1975 to distribute funds for community-based projects, has an annual budget of $1.625 million to divide among almost 80 programs statewide. ''It's not enough,'' said Mr. Vega of New Brunswick Tomorrow. ''It's not a lot of money.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vega, who is the chairman of the center's advisory board, said: ''But I don't want to criticize the government because the Whitman administration has been more open to help the Hispanic community than any other administration. Our budget before Whitman was $1.25 million and she was the one who advocated the increase.''</p>
        <p>The Hispanic community has pulled together to do many of the jobs the government does not finance.</p>
        <p>''We are the organizations that are taking care of the newly arrived immigrants,'' said Mr. Beytagh-Maldonado, who is also the president of the Hispanic Directors Association, a coalition of 27 Hispanic community-based organizations across the state that run preschools, health clinics, youth volunteer groups, housing services and English classes.</p>
        <p>While most of today's immigrants are seeking the same opportunities as the Europeans of generations ago, community leaders fear that the American Dream may now be more difficult to achieve. They cite Hispanic dropout rates in some school districts as high as 38 percent, a growing illiteracy problem and efforts by lawmakers to exclude immigrants from welfare benefits.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people that talk about immigration issues really use their own experience as a basis to make judgment about those that are now coming,'' Mr. Vega said. ''They say, 'Well, my grandfather migrated to this country and he was able to make it. Why can't you?' And that's a view that tends to blame the victim. Back several generations ago if you didn't have an education, that was fine. You could make a decent earning. You could make a living wage. Today, if you have no technical training or hard skills, you can't survive.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''Will the community advance and be equal to other communities? I don't know if it will happen in my lifetime, but I like to think that it will, but it's not going to be at the same rate as the immigrants of the past.''</p>
