        <p>IT is not mere consolation when the Silvermine Guild in New Canaan tells artists who didn't make the cut in its annual competition, ''Art of the Northeast,'' to try again next year.

        <p>IT is not mere consolation when the Silvermine Guild in New Canaan tells artists who didn't make the cut in its annual competition, ''Art of the Northeast,'' to try again next year. Every year the show has a different judge. Though all are prominent in the art world, the judges' tastes differ markedly, and for viewers, each year's edition has its own distinctive tone.</p>
        <p>Last year's judge was Allen Stone whose gallery in Manhattan can be counted on to show zany works as well as objects of classic beauty. This year the judge was George B. King, formerly director of the Katonah Art Museum, now director of the Georgia O'Keeffe Museum in Santa Fe, N.M. Even though O'Keeffe was a daring individualist, her images are now part of tradition, and Mr. King's Silvermine choices are largely traditional. They are also frequently commonplace and sometimes bewilderingly stale. But he also selected strong pieces, including some with humor.</p>
        <p>The show contains a lot of landscape and other nature imagery. A fine pairing of small works that might be overlooked by a viewer in a hurry is a pastel, ''Sabino Canyon,'' by Sharon Golden and Linda Merck-Gould's watercolor, ''Saugatuck River, Westport.'' Though the subject matter is geographically disparate, both works reveal their traditionally elusive mediums given weight and precise clarity. Along those same lines, ''Northeast Adobe,'' by Paula Madawick, is a colored-pencil drawing with strong luminosity. In the drawing a simple concrete building, but one with the traditional contours of an adobe hut, is being built.</p>
        <p>Small but annoying disparities exist between wall labels and information in the catalog. For example, Wendy Sherwin's work is titled ''Driving Through New Mexico Day and Night'' in the catalog. The three-part work is elaborate, with two depictions of rear-view mirrors catching scenery flanking a central landscape. But there is no night; a turquoise sky fills all the panels. The label reads only ''Driving Through New Mexico.'' What's more frustrating though is that Ms. Sherwin's depiction of a sensation lacks vitality. ''The Commute,'' by Gigi Horr Liverant, might be a companion piece to Ms. Sherwin's; there's nothing hedonistic about the twilight drive, and Ms. Horr Liverant's egg yolk yellow headlights are a false note.</p>
        <p>Good, satisfying, new abstraction has been in short supply on museum and gallery walls in recent years, but Mr. King found some. ''Sea Animal,'' by Jeanne Mitchell, might be just the traces of an animal. Intriguing small welts waft in linear patterns across a frothy blue surface.</p>
        <p>''Pirouette,'' by Carla Aurich, might be a simplified kaleidoscope pattern as it features symmetry and a sense of unfolding. To create the sensation of growth, several luminous layers of oil paint, some translucent, were painstakingly built up on a neutral ground. Paul Blaylock's untitled painting is absorbing as it contrasts rows of light-colored crosses with darker ones for surface action. But there's mystery below the surface as some of the crosses seem to disappear into or emerge from, the surface.</p>
        <p>A painting packing a punch is always a welcome find, and viewers might sense a fist, albeit a highly satisfying one, in ''Memorial for a Haida Chief,'' by Sergio Gonzalez-Tornero. The dominant bright red shape is reminiscent of the pictographic Abstract Expressionism of Adolph Gottlieb. For his part, Mr. Gonzalez-Tornero says the work is dedicated to a 19th-century carver of totem poles, Albert Wedard Edenshaw, and he might be trying to pack the inherent power of a totem carving in the aggressive shape. A pungent companion might be ''The Chieftain's Skirt,'' by Heidi Lewis Coleman. It's a traditional flat drawing, but is woven out of paper and painted with acrylic.</p>
        <p>The humor alluded to above is found in a major way in ''Hermes,'' by James Reich. This colorful jolly wiener-shaped messenger is heavily outlined like the bright and bouncy figures of Keith Haring. (Not humorous, but rather stately, David Safhay's ''Old Oak Tree'' gains much of its strength through the kind of heavy outline Haring put his stamp on.) Also a little loopy is Jay Clifford's painting, ''Wooden Indian.'' The figure is trying to squelch an expression.</p>
        <p>Nina Bentley's acidic tableau, ''Veiled Threats'' is a lineup of knives under loose wraps. But the actual sculpture in the show is decorous for the most part, and the elaborate pieces don't really work. Kimberly Russell's tower of drawers is supposed to be a dig at Martha Stewart, but it is not thought through; it misfires. Too many odd elements are in ''Venetian Measure,'' by Joseph Saccio, an arrangement of thin slats made from a cut-up tape measure  anchored by large rocks. But ''Three-Legged Mountain,'' by Kevin Thomas, is coherent while supporting allusions to nature, to a brazier or even to a U.F.O.</p>
        <p>The show has two real and heady high points. One is elegant, mysterious and content rich. ''Venetian Feeding,'' by Mikhail Gubin, sets one spinning many possible stories. The work is luridly and darkly colored, much in the manner of Max Beckmann, and features a man straining to feed a fish to a mermaid. The other singular work is a disk on which is painted, near the edge, the streamlined, international symbol for man. The artist, Adam Niklewicz, tells viewers to set the disk revolving; it moves slowly. The slowness lets us identify with this Everyman's rise and fall. But the circle can spin endlessly, as life goes on.</p>
        <p>''Art of the Northeast U.S.A.'' is at the Silvermine Guild in New Canaan until June 16.</p>
