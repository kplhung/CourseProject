        <p>MEL BROOKS, bless him, has never grown up. After three decades of making movies, his sense of humor has remained as broadly silly and gleefully infantile as ever. Beginning with ''The Producers,'' Mr. Brooks has sent up show business, and particularly movies, with an abandon worthy of applause even when the films are unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>Of the quintet of Mr. Brooks's movies recently released on DVD, only ''Young Frankenstein'' retains its originality and satirical bite; the early ''The Twelve Chairs'' and ''Blazing Saddles'' both contain several hilarious scenes, but are more of the usual scattershot approach; ''History of the World'' is a series of blackout sketches that never add up to anything memorably comic; while ''Spaceballs'' is a near-dud, a halfhearted takeoff on ''Star Wars'' that never takes off.</p>
        <p>What distinguishes the 1974 ''Young Frankenstein'' (20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, 106 minutes, $29.98) from Mr. Brooks's other movies is that it began as an idea of its star, Gene Wilder. As Mr. Wilder says in the short documentary ''Making Frankensense,'' only one of many extras on this superb 25th-anniversary DVD, he first wrote the script, then Mr. Brooks came on board to direct it (both men ended up receiving script credit). It was the first time that Mr. Brooks directed from a screenplay that was not his own, and he didn't appear onscreen either -- although, as he notes in his movie-length audio commentary, he did provide the sound of a cat being hit with a dart.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilder's subtler comic instincts keep the humor reined in, and so when the broader, more vulgar Brooksian bits pop up, they're kept in check by the stronger material. That's why it's a surprise to discover that the most famous set piece, of the monster and his creator donning top hat and tails for a singular take of ''Puttin' on the Ritz,'' came from Mr. Wilder, not Mr. Brooks, who, in fact, wanted to edit the sequence out, fearful that its outlandishness would stop the movie dead in its tracks.</p>
        <p>In addition to getting a chance to see this beautiful-looking black-and-white comedy in its original widescreen format, fans can also pore over several funny deleted scenes, a bunch of even funnier outtakes and on-set bloopers and, best of all, Mr. Brooks's continuous commentary.</p>
        <p>There's no denying that Mel Brooks is a funny guy, even when he's merely leading us through his movies. But he can also be very insightful, as when he discusses specific shots or lighting or the performance of an extra. And lavishing supreme praise on his actors is more than lip service; for Mr. Wilder, Mr. Feldman, Teri Garr, Peter Boyle and the incomparable comedian Madeline Kahn, ''Young Frankenstein'' was their finest onscreen hour (and 45 minutes).</p>
        <p>Too often during his commentary, the director bursts out laughing or apologizes for a bad joke or a dumb gag; it's what most distinguishes his discussion of ''Spaceballs,'' which alone makes this misfired spoof watchable.</p>
        <p>All during ''Spaceballs'' (1987, MGM Home Entertainment, 96 minutes, $24.98), Mr. Brooks proudly points out the obvious, the old-hat, the hoary, the supremely stupid: when someone says, ''Comb the desert'' for outlaws, that's just what they do, take a gigantic comb and run it through the sand.</p>
        <p>UNFORTUNATELY, ''Spaceballs'' demonstrates the limitations of its creator's kitchen-sink approach to comedy; Yoda becomes Yogurt, Jabba the Hutt is now Pizza the Hutt, a half man-half dog (''mog'') is called Barf, and so on. Such extreme childishness is an obvious result of Mr. Brooks's desperately wanting to make a ''Star Wars'' sendup without any real comic inspiration.</p>
        <p>Even though ''Blazing Saddles'' (1974; Warner Home Video, 93 minutes, $24.99) doesn't have an official audio commentary, the 55-minute Mel Brooks interview (in which he, true to form, hilariously discusses making the movie) does run on the audio track as the film plays, so it acts as a commentary and, indeed, helps us through some of this spotty Western spoof's rougher patches. Again, the high points in ''Blazing Saddles'' -- which looks great for the first time on home video in its original widescreen version -- involve Mr. Wilder's low-key presence and the indomitable Ms. Kahn, whose delicious turn as a Marlene Dietrich-like chanteuse (''A wed wose . . . how womantic'') got her a well-deserved Oscar nomination.</p>
        <p>No Oscar nominations were forthcoming for ''History of the World, Part I'' (1981; 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment, 92 minutes, $29.98), whose string of mostly lame skits makes the plot of ''Saddles'' seem positively Molierian. From the time Mr. Brooks totters into view as Moses, dropping one of three stone tablets and announcing ''The Fifteen . . . I mean, Ten Commandments,'' you know that groaners will prevail. Even the movie's one audacious moment -- the Spanish Inquisition as a splashy musical -- can't sustain its initial burst of inventiveness.</p>
        <p>Somewhat of an anomaly in Mr. Brooks's career, since it was based on a Russian story and has a vaguely Eastern European atmosphere, ''The Twelve Chairs'' (1970; Image Entertainment, 94 minutes, $24.99) arrives on DVD with no fan-friendly bonuses, which bespeaks its relatively lowly position in the Brooks canon. Sticking to its modest comedic guns with a minimum of truly gutbusting moments, at least ''The Twelve Chairs'' never descends to the depths of Mr. Brooks's most recent work, the embarrassingly unfunny spectacles ''Robin Hood: Men in Tights'' and ''Dracula: Dead and Loving It.''</p>
        <p>Beware of colons in movie titles: they unnecessarily explain the joke, something an old veteran like Mel Brooks once knew well.</p>
