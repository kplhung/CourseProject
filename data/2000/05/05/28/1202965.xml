        <p>YOU could say that Melanie Vassallo likes day lilies, but that would be an understatement. Ms. Vassallo loves day lilies so much that she has 425 named varieties of them in her Huntington Station garden on Long Island. And that does not count the hundreds of seedlings that have resulted from her hybridizing efforts.  Clearly raising day lilies is more than a casual hobby.</p>
        <p>Melanie Vassallo has probably never met Ray Rogers of North Brunswick, N.J., but they are spiritual cousins. Mr. Rogers, an editor of garden books by day, is a passionate iris collector. His garden is home to 130 named varieties of irises, including but not limited to the familiar tall bearded variety. He is in the process of installing a bog garden that will be filled with Louisiana, Japanese and species irises, in addition to other plants that are partial to ''wet feet.''</p>

        <p>YOU could say that Melanie Vassallo likes day lilies, but that would be an understatement. Ms. Vassallo loves day lilies so much that she has 425 named varieties of them in her Huntington Station garden on Long Island. And that does not count the hundreds of seedlings that have resulted from her hybridizing efforts.  Clearly raising day lilies is more than a casual hobby.</p>
        <p>Melanie Vassallo has probably never met Ray Rogers of North Brunswick, N.J., but they are spiritual cousins. Mr. Rogers, an editor of garden books by day, is a passionate iris collector. His garden is home to 130 named varieties of irises, including but not limited to the familiar tall bearded variety. He is in the process of installing a bog garden that will be filled with Louisiana, Japanese and species irises, in addition to other plants that are partial to ''wet feet.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Roger's iris habit has taken him to numerous shows and gotten him elected president of the New Jersey Iris Society. One of his children, a bearded iris named Muses's Visit, has brought him considerable positive attention among his fellow iris fanciers. He is truly passionate about these rhizomatous plants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogers and Ms. Vassallo are what horticulturists call single-genus people; obsessed or at least extremely serious about a specific plant genus. They acquire these objects of desire, plant them and exhibit them.  They talk about them, sometimes for money, more often simply for the love of it. In private moments they breed them and in public moments they brag about the results. The single-genus person is both inspiring and intimidating to the average gardener. How does someone become so devoted to one particular plant? It started in childhood for Mr. Rogers, with gifts from his aunts of two old-fashioned plants, Iris pallida and Iris variegata. Then, in 1967, his mother ordered a mixed iris assortment from Jackson &amp; Perkins. She had her son install them in his zinnia bed, an act that left him dismayed until the following spring, when the iris bloomed.</p>
        <p>''From that time I was hooked,'' he said. Shortly after this revelation, the teenage Mr. Rogers began ordering from Schreiner's, a mail-order nursery that specializes in irises. Eventually his enthusiasm led to two degrees in ornamental horticulture, a 15-year career in public gardens and arboreta, and a yard full of bearded irises.</p>
        <p>Ms. Vassallo began growing day lilies because she wanted a tough, easy to care for plant for her home garden. ''I needed something that wouldn't die if the kids ran over it with their bikes,'' she said. Quickly becoming hooked on day lilies, she sought out others with a similar passion for the colorful plants.</p>
        <p>In 1995 she joined the Long Island Daylily Society, of which she is now president. Immersed in the world of day lilies, she not only exhibits her prized plants, but lectures about them all over the United States.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Rogers and Ms. Vassallo are thoroughly attuned to the fads and fashions in their respective horticultural orbits. Ms. Vassallo is especially fond of spider-form day lilies, which have long, narrow petals instead of the broad ruffled petals of more familiar varieties.</p>
        <p>''Young people coming into the day lily world want spiders,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rogers noted that nonbearded irises such as Louisiana and Siberian varieties are ''coming on strong'' with young collectors. ''People are growing varieties that don't require as much care as the tall bearded iris,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Both plant collectors admit to being only part-time single-genus people. Melanie Vassallo also maintains a 120-foot mixed perennial border on her property. Mr. Rogers has spent a lot of time lately thinking about the shrubs that will form the ''bones'' of his garden. He is even putting primulas and trollius in his new bog garden in addition to irises. Though he adores the iris, he readily admitted, ''If I had a bigger garden, I wouldn't put in more iris. I would have day lilies and peonies.''</p>
        <p>If you fall madly in love with a specific plant genus, you may want to join a plant society.</p>
        <p>Barbara J. Barton's Gardening By Mail, available in book form or online at www.virtualgarden.com has an excellent listing of plant societies organized by genus.</p>
        <p>Local society chapters are also a good source of information on upcoming shows and events.</p>
