        <p>The wet ball spurted through legs and sticks and scrambling hands as the seconds spun off the clock. Virginia had blown an 11-9 edge in the semifinals of the men's national lacrosse tournament with a series of careless miscues, letting Princeton snatch a 12-11 lead. Now five seconds were left in the game.</p>
        <p>Virginia grabbed the ball and signaled for a timeout. But on the inbounds throw at midfield, as the senior Jay Jalbert bumped forward against the Princeton defender Winship Ross, it was too late. Jalbert crumpled to the ground in defeat as the Tigers screamed and swarmed the field, having upset Virginia, the defending national champion, 12-11.</p>
        <p>Princeton (12-2) will meet No. 1 Syracuse, which squeaked by Johns Hopkins, 14-12, today, in the National Collegiate Athletic Association championship game on Monday.</p>
        <p>''It's very difficult to be here and have this end like this,'' Virginia Coach Dom Starsia said. ''We didn't pick an opportune time to play poorly. We weren't doing the things we'd been doing well all season long, and I'm sort of at a loss to explain why.''</p>
        <p>Princeton sped out to a 2-1 lead on goals by the senior midfielder Josh Sims and the freshman attack Sean Hartofilis -- his first of five in the game. But Virginia (14-2) stormed back, scoring five of the next six goals for a 6-3 lead with 4 minutes 37 seconds left in the half.</p>
        <p>The Cavaliers had crushed Princeton earlier in the season, 15-8, after trailing in the first quarter and leading 7-5 at halftime. Today it was 7-5 at the half. Virginia had no reason to think that the day would end differently. But the Tigers did.</p>
        <p>''I told my guys in the locker room, last time there was fear in their eyes at halftime,'' a red-faced Tiger Coach Bill Tierney said. ''Today there was no fear. This is a bunch of no-names other than Josh Sims. People have said they're too young, not good enough, they lost their best player, but to persevere the way they have. It was a phenomenal effort on our part.''</p>
        <p>The junior goalie Trevor Tierney, the coach's son, made 14 saves, while the sophomore attack Brendan Tierney -- also the coach's son -- scored both of his two goals in the fourth quarter, including the game-winner.</p>
        <p>It seemed as though there might be two upsets in the semifinals, as Syracuse (14-1) struggled with silly penalties against Johns Hopkins (9-4). The Blue Jays were within one goal at the end of each of the first three quarters, but could not scrape ahead. They failed to capitalize on a stream of offensive opportunities. But the game still came down to the final seconds.</p>
        <p>With just under five minutes left, John Hopkins knotted the score at 12 on the first career goal by the freshman midfielder Tim Muir.</p>
        <p>But Mike Springer, a sophomore attack, slammed in a man-down goal on an assist by Powell to give Syracuse a 13-12 lead with 2:23 left. When Syracuse's Tim Byrnes swerved around the goal with 20 seconds left, ducking under desperate Blue Jay jabs, and powering the ball into the net, it was all over.</p>
