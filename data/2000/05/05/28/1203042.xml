        <p>She prefers to be called Ellie Babes, a former bar-top chorus girl with memories of tangos in Tangiers and merengues in Madrid. And she is still known in some corners of Brooklyn for her barroom bop.</p>
        <p>''We traveled a lot,'' she says, flaring her nostrils with pride. ''And when we traveled, we liked to drink.''</p>
        <p>There is, sadly, no we anymore. Just Ellie Babes and a lifetime of dance tickets floating at the bottom of a beer glass.</p>
        <p>Ellie Pooshejian is 69. Her dancing days are over and what's left of the traveling consists of catching two buses from her apartment in Windsor Terrace to Lundy's clam house in Sheepshead Bay. Either that or wandering in circles through her neighborhood, killing the hours in the local taverns. She measures time by the stroke of the iron bell that tolls from the belfry of the Holy Name Roman Catholic Church.</p>
        <p>''I retired last year and I had to move out of my co-op,'' she says in Farrell's, a Windsor Terrace barrelhouse at Prospect Park West and 15th Street. ''I felt I had to because I didn't want to die with property and leave that pickle for somebody else. I feel like a listing ship.''</p>
        <p>It is raining and Ellie pokes her head into the bar nervously, like a hen venturing into a strange barn. Farrell's is a man's domain, a neighborhood living room. Mornings of the 1st and 15th, the oak is stacked with men staring out the plate glass waiting for the bank across the street to open so they can cash their Social Security checks.</p>
        <p>She is the only woman in the place as the bell peals 8. The men turn and quickly size her up. She is a brassy little thing with a round, sad-eyed Armenian face and a cigarette-scarred voice that sounds like a board on a sanding belt. She wears leisure slacks and has beer on her breath.</p>
        <p>They make room for her at the rail and when she captures an ear, she knows how to hold it. She dispenses ditties the way some scatter seed.</p>
        <p>Ellie on aging: ''I used to be far left. Now I'm far smarter.''</p>
        <p>On money: ''Hate it. Ruined more people than tuberculosis.''</p>
        <p>On companionship: ''Like bushes without bees. Lonely is worse than hungry.''</p>
        <p>On silence: ''I heard it once.''</p>
        <p>On cigarettes: ''Forty a day. Pleasure knows no reason.''</p>
        <p>On work: ''I typed a lot of letters for a lot of men.''</p>
        <p>On religion: ''I believe.''</p>
        <p>This all seems interesting until you notice the men have gone glaze-eyed. Soon, they return to their vulgarities, mutterings and cursings, their sob stories, tales of woe and done-me-wrongs, stocks and bonds, beer and basketball. Ellie retires to the corner like so much furniture.</p>
        <p>''I hate being ignored,'' she says with a hiss. She drains her beer, snaps her bag shut and heads for the door. A wise guy cites Dylan Thomas as she passes by:</p>
        <p>Do not go gentle into that good night,</p>
        <p>Old age should burn and rave at close of day;</p>
        <p>Rage, rage against the dying of the light.</p>
        <p>''I see you've got an education,'' she says to him, ''but you're not much on looks.''</p>
