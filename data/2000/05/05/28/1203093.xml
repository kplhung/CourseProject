        <p>THE cold war is over. There are no longer two superpowers poised to obliterate each other and the world, restrained only by the Strangelovian doctrine of MAD, or Mutually Assured Destruction. And yet the world still bristles with 30,000 or so nuclear arms, many on permanent high alert, while the ranks of nuclear powers keep growing.</p>
        <p>''During the cold war, these weapons were considered regrettable but necessary because of the Communists,'' said George R. Perkovich, an arms expert at the W. Alton Jones Foundation, a private group in Charlottesville, Va. ''Well, the Communists are gone, we won the cold war, but we still have the weapons.''</p>
        <p>It is a peculiar state of affairs, and a frightening one, and for the first time in years those whose business is arms control are trying to construct a better way to deal with the Pandora's Box of the nuclear age.</p>
        <p>''People have decided that traditional arms control is broken,'' said Stephen Hadley, a Pentagon official in the Bush administration and a campaign adviser to Gov. George W. Bush. ''We've been keeping a large inventory of nuclear weapons that we don't need and that the military doesn't want.''</p>
        <p>Centrist thinkers on both sides of the political aisle are calling for deep cuts in remaining arsenals, for building antimissile defenses against rogue states, and for getting serious about stopping the spread of missile technology and nuclear arms.</p>
        <p>Impatience with the status quo can be seen everywhere. President Clinton is moving toward approving a limited antimissile system, initially of 100 interceptors in Alaska. Next week in Moscow, he is to meet with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin about amending the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty and making deep offensive cuts.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush said last week that as president he would reduce America's nuclear arsenal to its ''lowest possible number,'' perhaps unilaterally. ''Our mutual security need no longer depend on a nuclear balance of terror,'' he declared.</p>
        <p>Even the United Nations has bestirred itself. Last weekend, a conference to review the 1968 Non-Proliferation Treaty ended with the first-ever statement of ''unequivocal'' commitment from the United States and other nuclear powers to achieve comprehensive nuclear disarmament.</p>
        <p>Behind the shift -- besides sheer exasperation with decades of policy immobility -- lie significant changes in the strategic environment. Offensive weapons technology has spread far beyond the old nuclear club, and there has been steady progress in learning how to shoot down missiles from land, sea and space. These technological shifts will only gain in speed, and promise to fundamentally alter the field of play in the years and decades ahead.</p>
        <p>The new theoreticians, who have been talking informally in Washington for at least a year, also point to a depressing tally of arms control failures. ''The old paradigm has difficulties, many of them,'' said Jan M. Lodal, a former Pentagon official in the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>Among the troubles he cites are stalled arms control negotiations between Moscow and Washington, the growing irrelevance of the nuclear test ban treaty, which was shaken in 1998 by Indian and Pakistani bomb tests and crippled last year when the Senate rejected it, and the developing threat of long-range missiles from North Korea, Iraq and Iran.</p>
        <p>Most of those arguing for new approaches to the nuclear dilemma aim to deprive the atom of its prestige and power, to make it clear that a state can be a player on the world stage without the bomb.</p>
        <p>''There's no longer this cataclysmic threat of a major war every day, so we have to put nuclear weapons into the background of international affairs,'' said Mr. Perkovich. To this end, the nuclear powers should drastically cut their arsenals and take arms off high alert, as Mr. Bush proposed last week. That would help curb atomic envy in India, Pakistan and Japan, said Mr. Perkovich, author of ''India's Nuclear Bomb'' (University of California, 1999).</p>
        <p>Deep cuts, he added, would make America less of a nuclear hypocrite in world eyes, bolstering its moral authority in fighting the spread of missile technology and nuclear arms and aiding the enforcement of all kinds of international rules and inspections.</p>
        <p>''Look at Iraq,'' Mr. Perkovich said. ''They're wavering on enforcement. To get that, you need international support.''</p>
        <p>Not everyone is happy about the new thinking. Old-school arms controllers say the new theorists have yet to explain how antimissile defenses would avoid stimulating new arms races and strategic insecurity, which could create conflict.</p>
        <p>''There may be something new here, because people are searching for an alternative to doing nothing, or doing the president's plan,'' said Joseph Cirincione, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. In his view, however, arms control is inseparable from the certainty that the first use of nuclear weapons would mean one's own destruction.  ''You can't cut the Gordian knot,'' he said.</p>
        <p>THAT is what makes antimissile arms the most contentious part of the new calculus. Even if affordable and feasible against rogue-state threats, missile defenses, paradoxically, are often seen as endangering the stability that comes with MAD (which is why the ABM treaty sought to scrap them).</p>
        <p>If mutual destruction did not seem assured, the major nuclear powers would base their war plans on overwhelming any shield with swarms of warheads, critics argue. So Russia would refuse to cut its arsenal further and China, which now has 20 or so warheads that can threaten the United States, might deploy hundreds of new ones, experts say. And that could set off chain reactions in India, Pakistan and Japan.</p>
        <p>''Deploying a national missile defense will surely crush hopes for the positive arms control steps,'' said John Isaacs, president of the Council for a Livable World, a Washington arms control group.</p>
        <p>Even more ominously, the rest of the world might view with alarm a United States protected by antimissile defenses, reasoning that it could fire a crippling first strike at an opponent's offensive weapons and use antimissile arms to protect itself against any weak retaliation. Analysts worry that the very existence of this possibility could, in times of crisis, trigger war.</p>
        <p>The new thinkers say such fears can be managed through intense strategic cooperation not just with allies, but with rivals and even foes. The keys are avoiding any surprises, relentlessly emphasizing benign intent and bringing others under the new-paradigm umbrella by sharing warning systems and possibly even antimissile arms. They point to East-West talks on defense sharing in the closing days of the cold war, and say new initiatives might be much broader, involving more nations.</p>
        <p>''The key question,'' said Michael Krepon, president of the Henry L. Stimson Center, a policy group in Washington at the center of the new strategic thinking,''is whether the impulse to build defenses destroys the prospect for a cooperative transition.'' If so, he said, ''you're stuck.''</p>
