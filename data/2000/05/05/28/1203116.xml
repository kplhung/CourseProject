        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As someone born in the midst of World War II I was intrigued by your Sunday essay on the Silent Generation. It's true that very little is written or said about us, a small, inconspicuous cohort born of depression and raised in international conflict (three wars in close succession--WWII, Korea, and Vietnam in my first 25 years- and don't forget the Cold War!). Even at my college's 25th reunion, no one  made notice of our unique place in history as ''War Babies.'' So I was very interested in what you and Ann Fishman had to say about ''us.'' We were shaped by a number of revolutions and maybe that's why we are so cautious. Remember, we were born at the beginning of the atomic age, and  antibiotics; and the first group to use the Pill; and the first to be acquainted with computers; and rock 'n' roll. I was on the cusp of change in college -- one era when I entered in 1960, another era when I left in  1964. Was the Kennedy assassination the turning point? My four year younger brother is of another generation to be sure. The ''silents'' do have an important role in being harbingers of what he and the other Boomers will do in terms of retirement--particularly in how we handle our finances and whether we relocate or not. So I see ''us'' as being on the cutting edge, setting the stage for those hordes behind us. In short, there's a lot to be said about us but we ain't talking! I'm glad there are at least two other people who find this subject interesting!</p>
