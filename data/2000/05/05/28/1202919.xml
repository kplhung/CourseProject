        <p>Watching the giant dredges slurp sand from the sea floor and spray it back onto the beach is a pastime that New Jerseyans will have little of this summer, since state and federal officials say the beaches are looking hearty at the start of this season.</p>
        <p>''I think some people are going to be disappointed that we're not out there,'' said Bernie Moore, administrator of the state's division of engineering and construction. ''You wouldn't believe it, but I was out in Spring Lake last year on a dredging project and at 2 in the morning people were out there with lawn chairs to watch.''</p>

        <p>Watching the giant dredges slurp sand from the sea floor and spray it back onto the beach is a pastime that New Jerseyans will have little of this summer, since state and federal officials say the beaches are looking hearty at the start of this season.</p>
        <p>''I think some people are going to be disappointed that we're not out there,'' said Bernie Moore, administrator of the state's division of engineering and construction. ''You wouldn't believe it, but I was out in Spring Lake last year on a dredging project and at 2 in the morning people were out there with lawn chairs to watch.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Moore added: ''When we first began a job in Monmouth Beach near the Beach Club a guy came out with a hot dog wagon last summer and did a land office business.''</p>
        <p>This summer, shore residents can keep their lawn chairs on the patio.</p>
        <p>The state Department of Environmental Protection says both the sand and the water are ''remarkably clean.''</p>
        <p>Virginia Loftin, the state's principal environmental specialist, says the water quality last summer was good, and that this year should be no different.</p>
        <p>''We don't officially start the coastal monitoring until May 22, but there have not been any floatables reported,'' Ms. Loftin said.</p>
        <p>She attributed cleaner sand to the implementation of the Clean Shores Program, initiated in 1991, which uses inmate labor to scour the sand.</p>
        <p>While people in orange jumpsuits have been collecting the trash all year on the beaches, the state and federal governments -- with help from the elements -- have tried to ensure there was sand to cleanse.</p>
        <p>A lack of severe winter storms, coupled with beaches' ability to hang on to more than 80 percent of sand placed there since 1994, means that many projects scheduled for this summer have been postponed while others are wrapping up in time for the  summer season, Mr. Moore said.</p>
        <p>''We're looking to finish our projects around Avon and Asbury in mid-July and even what we are doing now will not interfere with people going to the beach,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A $28 million replenishment project begun by the state in 1999, covering a two-mile stretch from Asbury Park to Avon-by-the-Sea, has only the extension of sewer outfall pipes and jetties to be completed.</p>
        <p>Another project -- replacing sand from Sea Bright to Long Branch at a cost of $70 million -- placed about 12 million cubic yards of sand on the beaches. ''That project started in 1994 and was slated for more work in 2000, but they fared so well that the work has been held off,'' Mr. Moore said.</p>
        <p>Not that the future will be free of dredges for New Jersey's 127-mile coastline.</p>
        <p>The next big replenishment project planned by the state -- from Atlantic City down to Longport -- is expected to be awarded in August and begin after Labor Day. A study of Long Beach Island is expected to be completed by the end of summer, Mr. Moore said, and a $50 million dollar project begun in 2003.</p>
        <p>He said the ''only real trouble spots left right now, where beaches are still losing sand, are in Upper Township near Strathmore and in Ocean City, and those projects won't start until after Labor Day.''</p>
        <p>On the federal side, the Army Corp of Engineers is involved in a renourishment project, begun in 1994, that will span 50 years. Work has been completed in Sea Bright, Manasquan, Monmouth Beach and Belmar as well as in Asbury Park, with the exception of extending outfalls and jetties.</p>
        <p>For now, the only replenishment project up and running is in Bradley Beach, and is expected to end by June 15, said Anthony Ciorra, project manager for the Army Corps of Engineers in New York.</p>
        <p>The work is part of a project begun last year in the area stretching from Asbury Park to Bradley Beach. This $24 million phase covers 3 million cubic yards of sand. To date, 2.7 million cubic yards have been placed on the beaches with 400,000 cubic yards left to go as jetties are extended and outfalls lengthened.</p>
        <p>''The project does close about 1,000 linear feet of beach at a time to tourists,'' Mr. Ciorra said. ''They'll be out of there by the time the beach traffic hits full swing..''</p>
        <p>The last place on the Army Corps' list is a stretch of Deal, where the state has not obtained the necessary easements.</p>
        <p>''Since we began these replenishment projects in New Jersey, the critics and academics have fallen silent since they saw how well the beaches have held on to the sand,'' Mr. Ciorra said.</p>
