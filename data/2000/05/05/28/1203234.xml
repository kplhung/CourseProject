      <abstract>
        <p>Correction of article in Apr 16 Home Design section about Gino's, New York City restaurant, regarding its decor and financing</p>
      </abstract>
    </body.head>
    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article on April 16 in Home Design, Part 2 of The Times Magazine, about Gino, an Italian restaurant on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, omitted the name of the partner who founded it with Gino Circiello and Guy Avventuriero in 1945. He was Emilio Torre.</p>
        <p>The article also misstated the origin of the restaurant's zebra-print wallpaper. It came from a friend of the partners, Valentino Crescenzi, not from the textile firm of Scalamandre Inc. Scalamandre reproduced the paper for the restaurant in the early 1970's after much of the original paper was destroyed in a fire.</p>
        <p>The article also omitted one side in a disputed account of the financing. Mr. Circiello says that the partners used their own money to open Gino and did not borrow from Franco Scalamandre, the firm's founder.</p>
        <p>A letter dated April 26 from Mr. Circiello to the writer of the article was brought to the editors' attention early in May. This correction was further delayed for fact-checking.</p>
