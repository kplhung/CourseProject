        <p>A former hospital and historical landmark that faces Central Park will be developed into condominiums if a pending sale goes through.</p>
        <p>Daniel McLean, a Chicago developer known for building sometimes-controversial luxury housing in cities across the United States, is in contract to purchase the dilapidated five-tower building, which comes with a permit to build a 27-story structure on an adjoining empty lot.</p>
        <p>Mr. McLean would not comment on the price of the site, but said he hoped to build 140 luxury condominiums. Local real estate experts said they would expect such a property to fetch more than $20 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. McLean and Chris Schlank, the seller of the 42,600-square-foot site on Central Park West between 105th and 106th Streets, met with the land-use committee of Community Board 7 on May 17 to get its backing for a variance for residential use.</p>
        <p>The committee approved the request for a residential variance, which the property held in the 1980's, with minor adjustments. The request will go before the full board on June 6, and then to the Board of Standards and Appeals.</p>
        <p>Yoron Cohen, Mr. Schlank's real estate agent, said the variance change was ''really a technicality.''</p>
        <p>Larry Horowitz, co-chairman of the land-use committee, said the new variance request was approved with 58 underground parking spaces, down from 150 allowed by the previous variance for residential use.</p>
        <p>''There was some debate about the parking,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Horowitz said that while some local residents do not like the idea of the 27-story tower, its construction has generally been accepted as a necessary part of preserving the landmark building and cleaning up the weed-filled land around it.</p>
        <p>Mr. McLean's other projects include a proposal to build 315 luxury condominiums on an island near Miami, a plan some residents oppose because it would increase the island's housing stock by more than a third.</p>
