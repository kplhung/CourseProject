      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In the early 20th century, a Seattle society photographer named Edward S. Curtis came up with a plan: to produce an illustrated encyclopedia that would document the lives of the Hopi, the Apache, the Cree and as many other North American Indian tribes as Curtis could persuade to cooperate with him. At the time, the American Indian population had become a source of curiosity rather than of fear; their numbers had dwindled to some 250,000 and were, Theodore Roosevelt wrote in 1906, ''on the point of passing away.'' In his introductory essay to EDWARD SHERIFF CURTIS, 1868-1952 (Taschen, $39.99), a handsomely produced collection of Curtis's American Indian photographs, Hans Christian Adam notes that there were many ethnographers who were not impressed with the photographer's grand ambitions. But Curtis, who possessed little formal education, had enough swaggering self-confidence and talent as a photographer to convince a few influential people that he was capable of taking on the project. Among those people were Roosevelt, who praised Curtis for doing ''what no other man could do,'' and J. Pierpont Morgan, who helped finance Curtis's research expeditions. During those travels, Curtis met members of some 80 tribes and made avid notes on everything from religious dances to eyewitness accounts of the Battle of the Little Bighorn. The photographs in ''Edward Sheriff Curtis'' have been largely culled from ''The North American Indian,'' the title given to Curtis's 20 leather-bound, gilt-edged volumes, each of which was accompanied by a portfolio of photographs. Many of these sepia-toned photographs of, for instance, a Teton Sioux in a feathered headdress or a Piegan medicine man were widely reproduced in magazines and as individually sold works of art. Over the years the pictures have contributed to the popular perception of the first inhabitants of North America, depicting, Adam writes, ''Indians as they might once have been -- or, rather, as we might wish them to have been.''</p>
