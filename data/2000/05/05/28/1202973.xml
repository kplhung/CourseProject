        <p>Re: ''Lots of Blame Going Around in (631) Glitches'' [May 7].</p>
        <p>Long Islanders' inability to call across Route 110 is the most damning evidence yet that Bell Atlantic's arrival in the new world of deregulated telecommunications has not only hit a shoal, but has succeeded in hurting virtually anyone who depends on the telephone.</p>
        <p>There is no small irony that Bell Atlantic's crisis comes as the company has enlisted seemingly every telemarketer in North America to phone us during dinner to insist that its new long distance service is where we want to be.</p>
        <p>In the last several months, the Public Service Commission fined Bell Atlantic for failing to permit viable local phone competition when it secured permission to go into long distance service. Now communication companies are filing complaint after complaint regarding a broad range of Bell Atlantic disconnects, 631 being just one of them. The commission should get Bell Atlantic's attention by levying a fine that is heavy enough to convince consumers that this is not how the telecom business is to be done in the 21st Century.</p>
        <p>Genuine competition is supposed to be mean that utilities like Bell Atlantic work leaner, smarter, faster and better. Instead, they have created the Long Island Expressway of telephone paths.</p>
