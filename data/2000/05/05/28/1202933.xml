        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>An insurance lawyer in  Newark was telling me how he tried to emphasize the value of education to his teenage daughter.</p>
        <p>He told her that he had a B.A., an L.L.B., a J.D., a C.L.U., and a C.F.A.</p>
        <p>''Dad,'' she answered, ''it doesn't mean a thing if you don't have a BMW.''</p>

        <p>MEMORIAL DAY</p>
        <p>Atop the pole Old Glory flaps,</p>
        <p>The trumpeter intoning taps</p>
        <p>For those who gave their lives so you</p>
        <p>Are free today to barbecue.</p>
        <p>BOB McKENTY</p>
        <p>When my oldest grandaughter, Natalie, was 4 years old, I took her home to my house without her parents for the first time. When I pressed the garage door opener and drove in, she said in amazement, ''The car goes in the garage?''</p>
        <p>Recently, I picked-up my youngest granddaughter, Andrea, now 4, who lives in an older home with a detached garage. As I drove into the garage, she exclaimed, ''The house goes into the garage?''</p>
        <p>This lead me to write:</p>
        <p>GARAGES</p>
        <p>Garages were designed to park the cars in which we ride.</p>
        <p>Detached at first, they then were joined to where we all reside.</p>
        <p>Soon they became the place where other things could hide.</p>
        <p>And because there is no room, the cars are left outside!</p>

        <p>In recognition of Mother's Day recently, my son's first-grade class was asked to bring in an item that represented or reminded them of their Mom.</p>
        <p>After careful consideration, my 7-year-old grabbed one of my aprons and headed off to school. When he came home I asked how show and tell went. He proceeded to tell me of the various Mommy mementos that were shared, including his own, which he said he proudly modeled.</p>
        <p>When I asked if anyone laughed, he replied, ''Not as much as when I told them it was your uniform.''</p>

        <p>And speaking of Mother's Day . . .</p>
        <p>Scene: Friendly's Restaurant in Hackettstown on Mother's Day morning. One elderly woman, accompanied by a daughter, meets another elderly woman entering with her husband and introduces the daughter.</p>
        <p>Daughter: ''Are you a friend from church?''</p>
        <p>Second lady: ''Oh no, from the gym. We often pump iron together.''</p>
        <p>How times change.</p>
        <p>FLORENCE E. BRYAN</p>
        <p>While shopping one night at a supermarket in Monroe Township, I overheard a young woman telling a friend:</p>
        <p>''Personally, I think there should ber a supermarket where no one over 60 is admitted. I would be willing to pay more so I didn't have to contend with people who don't work, have no conception of time or why they're even there.''</p>
        <p>I turned to her and said in a retaliatory tone: ''I suggest that you shop in the evening because seniors are fearful of going out at night. After all, there's the possibility of being mugged or shot by people under 60.''</p>

        <p>MINIMUM WAGE</p>
        <p>The minimum wage dictates minimum pay</p>
        <p>Unless you're a juror at five bucks a day.</p>
