        <p>THE Ginsburg Development Corporation, a 36-year-old home builder known for the quality of its houses and condominiums in Westchester County, has opened its first project in Connecticut, a condominium community of detached single-family homes in the Georgetown section of Redding.</p>
        <p>Called Redding Woods, the Victorian cottage-style development at 62 Redding Road (Route 107) sits on a wooded knoll with views of forested hills receding into the distance. Of the 23 homes to be built by the end of the year, six have been sold since sales began a month ago. The four models, with 2,500 square feet to 3,600 square feet, are priced from $489,000 to $589,000.</p>
        <p>Condos are the exception, not the rule in Redding, and Georgetown is the only section where they are allowed. Only one other condominium complex exists, with four apartments in a single building.</p>
        <p>The Ginsburg company, which has filed plans for almost 400 homes in two projects elsewhere in Fairfield County, in Danbury and Newtown, has been known in Westchester for its focus on the high-end town-house niche, often on challenging sites.</p>
        <p>Joseph A. Novella Jr., the president of Ginsburg Development CT in Danbury, the new Connecticut division set up by the company, said, ''Our charge is to become the premier multifamily community developer in Connecticut: to deliver what there is a dire lack of -- a variety of luxury town homes for empty nesters, aging baby boomers, singles, people who may not have children, people in nontraditional family situations, and do it at a reasonable price.''</p>
        <p>Paul Shew, the village manager of Ossining, N.Y., spoke highly of the Ginsburg company. ''G.D.C. did a substantial project here known as Mystic Pointe -- high-end condos up to the $600,000 range,'' he said. ''Our building department was impressed with the fact that everything was done according to the book. No corners cut. The development is regarded as one of our better ones -- attractive, well built, exceptionally marketable.''</p>
        <p>Paul Feiner, the supervisor of the Town of Greenburgh, N.Y., where the Ginsburg company has built three projects, has a fourth under construction and is planning a fifth, owns a Ginsburg home. ''Five years ago when my wife and I were looking for a house, the only three we liked were Ginsburg's. We bought one in Boulder Ridge from the original owner, and we love it. Ginsburg buys property nobody would think is buildable -- on a steep slope, or covered with rocks and boulders, and builds on it. The projects are very pleasing aesthetically and very well built.''</p>
        <p>Thomas Gissen, Ginsburg's director of development, described its business philosophy like this: ''We have tried to develop a niche in the very upscale town home or clustered single-family home development, with heavy investment in architectural detail and landscaping. We look closely at the site, and the character of the local community. We don't try to jam a square peg into a round hole. Redding, for example, is very dissimilar from Yonkers. We try to work within that.''</p>
        <p>BY making Redding the site of its first foray into Connecticut, the company is moving into an active market. Amy Pardee, the Redding's zoning enforcement officer, said: ''We're having a little building boom here. We're the next town up from lower Fairfield County, ripe for development, so we might as well brace ourselves.''</p>
        <p>Incorporated in 1764, Redding has preserved much of its early rural atmosphere. It contains two districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Its large village green is the site of summer concerts, and its library, founded in 1908 by Mark Twain with a collection from his own library, holds one of the largest book sales in the state each August. Twain moved to Redding in 1908 and died there in 1910.</p>
        <p>Only 9,000 people inhabit Redding's 32.3 square miles, almost all of it zoned for two-acre, single-family lots. More than 4,000 acres are protected in permanent open space. Georgetown is the only section of Redding with municipal sewers and water.  Other parts of Georgetown belong to Ridgefield, Weston and Wilton.</p>
        <p>Martin Ginsburg, the president and chief operating officer of the development company, and his brother, Sam, the other principal, are both architects, and their developments are known for their architectural integrity. Since 1964 the company, which is based in Hawthorne, N.Y., has built more than 1,650 houses and condominiums and 2,300 rental apartments in 20 projects along the East Coast, from Florida to Westchester. The brothers made a decision two years ago, Martin Ginsburg said, ''to go into new territories,'' specifically Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Fourteen months ago, the Ginsburgs bought the 10-acre Redding tract for $1.5 million from Adam Lebarski, owner of the Georgetown Saloon on Main Street, and began reworking Mr. Lebarski's previously approved subdivision.</p>
        <p>William Delsner, the designer of the Redding Woods homes, was brought into the project by Mr. Novella, whose family-owned  construction company, the Novella Development Corporation in Danbury, merged with  Ginsburg two years ago. Mr. Delsner, the Ginsburgs and Jane Didona, a landscape architect, scrapped the subdivision's original cookie-cutter layout and the identical designs for the houses, but the footprints of the houses could not be changed without going through a new approval process.</p>
        <p>Mr. Delsner's designs incorporate a contemporary reinterpretation of turn-of-the-century details like bay windows, covered porches and trellises. The roof lines have several levels, the lower levels of the houses have stone facing, and the garage doors, with their arches and crisscrossed moldings, are reminiscent of carriage houses. Rather than being positioned in a straight line going up the hill, the houses are scattered informally along a single dead-end road.</p>
        <p>Mr. Delsner is not a licensed architect, but a structural engineer on his staff and an architect sign off on the blueprints. On this project he worked closely with Ms. Didona to make the new houses look as if they had been there for years. Period street lights further that effect.</p>
        <p>The site posed some challenges: one side drops to the road below at a 30-degree angle. ''Very often you get much more interesting results with a difficult site,'' Martin Ginsburg said. ''We've been dealing with difficult sites in Westchester for a long time, so we've developed a lot of expertise over the years.''</p>
        <p>THE land was too steep for lawns, and the designers rejected a covering of  loosely laid stone. Their solution?  Huge sheets of green fabric installed against the hill, impregnated with wildflower seeds. With luck, each spring there will be little bluestem, switch grass, partridge pea, nodding bur marigold, showy tick trefoil and green-headed coneflower growing through the fabric, securing the soil, blooming and dying back naturally in the fall.</p>
        <p>Of the four models of houses, three have three bedrooms and one has two. All have two and a half baths, two-car garages, nine-foot first-floor ceilings (eight feet upstairs) and solid-core interior doors. A large attic loft can be finished in one model for use as another bedroom or office. The space above the garage in another model can be finished as an all-purpose room with a pyramid ceiling 18 feet high at its point.</p>
        <p>Basements will be finished, waterproofed  and carpeted. Some will be completed as guest suites with living rooms, bedrooms and full baths. Basements in the houses with the steep backyards open onto patios.</p>
        <p>The Ginsburg company has proposed two other developments that are currently going through the approval process in Connecticut: 280 town homes in Danbury and 110 condominiums for people 55 and older in Newtown.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gissen, Ginsburg's director of development, said, ''We are hoping for another 'active adult' community of 70 luxury units in Farmington, 150 town homes in a lower Litchfield County town that I am not at liberty to name, and we are looking at properties in the New London and New Haven areas.''</p>
        <p>When about two-thirds of the homes at Redding Woods are sold, a homeowners' association will be formed to maintain the road, lawns, landscaping and the exteriors of the houses. Common charges are expected to run about $2,000 a year. Property taxes, which will be set in July, may range from $5,500 to $6,500, said Diane Eppoliti, the sales agent for Redding Woods at Raveis Real Estate in Georgetown.</p>
