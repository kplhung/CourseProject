        <p>GALATA TURKISH KABAB HOUSE  ++  (212) 452-2752; 1586 First Avenue, between 82nd and 83rd Streets; $; smoking permitted; Visa and MasterCard.</p>
        <p>This narrow, plain restaurant used to be Agora, where the Mediterranean menu had a pronounced Turkish influence. Now, new owners have renamed it, and the emphasis on Turkish food is even stronger. Cold appetizers include red kidney beans cooked in tomato, potatoes, carrots, onions and garlic in olive oil; grape leaves stuffed with rice, pine nuts, raisins, onions and currants; and smoked puree eggplant, sesame oil, lemon juice and a hint of garlic. Main courses include small chunks of baby lamb marinated with seasonings, charcoal-broiled; chunks of baby eggplant with ground leg of lamb, seasoned with fresh herbs; and Turkish meatballs with cubes of lightly fried pita bread and tomato sauce topped with yogurt.

        <p>HENRY'S CAFE EVERGREEN  +++  (212) 744-3266; 1288 First Avenue, between 69th and 70th Streets; $$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>The emphasis is on the food of Shanghai, and while the menu offers main dishes, one look will tell you that everyone is eating appetizers, noodles and dumplings. Appetizers include bean curd crepe vegetable roll; crispy fried won ton with sweet and sour sauce; sesame cold noodles; and shredded chicken with sesame peanut sauce. Entrees include shredded duck sauteed with julienne vegetables; sauteed noodles (buckwheat) with crab meat and mushrooms; and wok-seared whole gray sole. (New York Today: June 1998)</p>
        <p>L'ARDOISE  +++  (212) 744-4752; 1207 First Avenue, between 65th and 66th Streets; $; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>The well-prepared traditional French food more than makes up for the minimalist design of this little restaurant. Appetizers include oven-cooked crusty goat cheese served with mesclun salad; gnocchi and sauteed wild mushrooms topped with Parmesan cheese, misted with white truffle oil; and roasted burgundy vineyard snails in a garlic parsley butter. Main courses include sauteed calf's liver with caramelized shallots and a raspberry vinegar sauce and mashed potatoes; grilled salmon fillet served with seasonal vegetables and baby leeks, honey and lemon sauce blanche; and New Zealand rack of lamb roasted with three-color beans, served with a rosemary sauce. (New York Today: April 1998)</p>
        <p>MAYA  ** [Rating: Two Stars]  (212) 585-1818; 1191 First Avenue, between 64th and 65th Streets; $$$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>The setting is colorful with rosy walls and an inlaid wood floor. Most of the bowls, glassware and serving pieces seem handmade. But it is the food that really wakes you up. Starters include seared halibut thinly sliced, served with tuna tartare, tossed with jicama, huitlacoche and citrus vinaigrette; shrimp sauteed with habanero and tamarind, wrapped in a crispy flour tortilla, served with a black bean puree, baby spinach and roasted chile de arbol salsa; and baked oysters topped with goat cheese, habanero-chive rouille and crispy bacon. Entrees include sauteed shrimp flambe with tequila served with black bean and manchego cheese huarache and chipotle salsa; grilled chicken breast served with cilantro rice, plantains and mole poblano sauce; and scallops, shrimps, mussels and clams, sauteed with garlic, served with black rice and coriander seed-red pepper emulsion. (Review: 7/18/97)</p>
        <p>PETALUMA  +++  (212) 772-8800; 1356 First Avenue, at 73rd Street; $$$; smoking section and at the bar; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Petaluma is more California Italian than New York Italian, with fresh flavors and big portions of pasta. The large, bustling room is especially good for diners with children. Antipasti selections include New Zealand clams with marinara sauce; stuffed mushrooms and asparagus gratin; and cold grilled artichoke hearts and shrimp. Entrees include linguine with clams, olive oil and garlic; gnocchi with tomato, basil and a touch of cream; swordfish with tomatoes, capers and olives; and red snapper with olive oil, lemon and herbs. (New York Today: April 1998)</p>
        <p>SUSHIHATSU  *** [Rating: Three Stars]  (212) 371-0238; 1143 First Avenue, between 62nd and 63rd Streets; $$$$; no smoking; American Express and Diner's Club.</p>
        <p>The sushi bar here offers breathtakingly good fish of an astonishing purity, fish that seems so light you feel you could go on eating forever. Appetizers include deep-fried shrimp with white fish and vegetables; broiled squid legs with teriyaki sauce or salt; and soft shell crab, deep fried, served with ponz sauce. Entrees include tonkatsu, deep-fried breaded pork cutlet with tonkatsu sauce; broiled scallion rolled with beef, marinated in a teriyaki sauce; shrimp, fish and vegetables tempura marinated in special sauce topped on steamed rice; and beef and assorted vegetables cooked in sukiyaki sauce.
