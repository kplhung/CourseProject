        <p>THE INCOMPARABLE REX</p>
        <p>A Memoir of Rex Harrison in the 1980s.</p>
        <p>By Patrick Garland.</p>

        <p>Rex Harrison was no ordinary man. The dazzling Henry Higgins of ''My Fair Lady'' also ran roughshod through the lives of nearly everyone he encountered, from wives to waiters. Harrison was ''impervious throughout his life to public opinion,'' Patrick Garland, the producer and director of the 1980 revival of ''My Fair Lady,'' writes. Harrison called Laurence Olivier ''frightfully decrepit'' and his neighbor Greta Garbo ''a colossal bore.'' The actress Carole Landis died from an overdose of barbiturates after a ''hectic love affair'' with Harrison while he was married to Lilli Palmer, the second of his six wives. He was no hero to his valet, either, nor his valet to him. While en route from Los Angeles to New York with Harrison's hats, the poor man was murdered, prompting his boss to muse, ''And now, I suppose I'll never get my hats.'' On his deathbed in 1990 he told one of his sons, whose girlfriend he had married: ''Drop dead! That's what you can do for me.'' But he reserved his last words for his younger son, a musician: ''There was something I always wanted to tell you. I could never stand the sound of your . . . guitar.'' When a waiter punched Harrison for his obnoxious behavior, his wife at the time called it the happiest day of her life. Garland, who liked Harrison anyway, has nonetheless written a good book for those who own sofa pillows embroidered ''If you have nothing nice to say, come sit by me.''</p>
