        <p>PREMIERES are unnatural births. Humans, unlike Greek gods and new operas, enter the world helpless and barely formed. In that first frail state are strong hints of what we shall become, but a minimum of 20 years is required before the qualities we take through life are actualities, not promises. An opening night, especially one preceded by fanfare, speculation and promotion, has no chance at childhood and adolescence. Often its midwives are inept and its expectant parents unprepared. The new piece happens all at once and fully formed. It relies on the wisdom and charity of audiences, critics and performers faced suddenly with an odd phenomenon: the grown-up infant.</p>
        <p>Thomas Forrest Kelly's new book, ''First Nights,'' from Yale University Press, is about famous musical births. Based on a popular course Mr. Kelly has developed at Harvard, the book is more chronicle than speculation, but it sets in place and time five historic premieres and gives the inquiring reader much to feed on. The works are Monteverdi's ''Orfeo'' (1607), Handel's ''Messiah'' (1742), Beethoven's Ninth Symphony (1824), Berlioz's ''Symphonie Fantastique'' (1830) and Stravinsky's ''Sacre du Printemps'' (1913).</p>
        <p>A companion book is needed, one that would tell the stories of expected triumphs that proved, immediately or with time, anything but. As advertising and public relations have grown in sophistication, such gilded failures have become more numerous. Times have changed since Berlioz ran frantically through Paris distributing posters, assembling audiences and schmoozing critics and money men. We Americans are especially hopeful people, and when a new opera is lionized before the fact, we let our optimism run wild.</p>
        <p>Composers today have more means at their disposal. If the amateurs in Beethoven's string sections put down their bows in difficult passages, if Berlioz's musicians failed to count rests, and if Stravinsky's players scarcely heard themselves against the din of protest, composers are now blessed with quick-study musicians and with audiences that have, for better and worse, been tamed into polite submission.</p>
        <p>Critics don't deserve a lot of pity, but at premiere time they are up against it. The job of measuring a new opera is not much different from sizing up the stranger newly met. One hopes for prescience and fears the false impression. My experience with people has tended to go as follows: instant like or dislike, followed by an amended view based on reason and afterthought, almost always followed by a return to that first instinctive jab of feeling. Maybe new pieces of music have to be approached the same way.</p>
        <p>Granted, afterthought can be powerful, yielding valuable information not originally heeded and changing minds, sometimes for the better. But never give up on that initial impulse. It deserves your serious attention. When I first heard a relatively obscure Alfred Brendel play the piano in Vienna 40 years ago, impulse told me to go and hear him again, and I have been doing so ever since.</p>
        <p>The serious witness to a new work can go two ways. One is to prepare as best you can. Get the score, hear rehearsals when possible, listen to symposiums and lectures, read analyses. In other words, take as much of the newness away from that first impression as possible. The other thought is that surprise is really what premieres are all about.</p>
        <p>It goes back to the old question of whether we listen more profitably by ''knowing'' and ''understanding'' or simply by letting our accumulated reservoir of experience, along with instinct, do its work. The first camp can be accused of dulling the thrill of discovery, the second of using the ''instinct'' theory as a cover for scholarly laziness.</p>
        <p>The Monteverdi ''reviews'' come in the form of politely enthusiastic reminiscence. Viennese critics forgave the evidently mangled performance of Beethoven's Ninth out of deference toward the great man. Berlioz had his performance problems, too, but as with the Beethoven, certain touches set off spontaneous applause in midperformance. Pierre Monteux, forever associated with ''Le Sacre,'' apparently used his meticulous conducting skills to bring difficult music safely through impossible conditions. Yet he did not like Stravinsky's piece and continued to dislike it throughout his long life.</p>
        <p>In all these examples, one senses an audience awareness that something extraordinary was taking place. Maybe others attending the premieres of such recent operas as John Harbison's ''Great Gatsby'' or Andre Previn's ''Streetcar Named Desire'' had that same thrill, even if I did not. And should I have felt it? Maybe I knew too much in advance and felt swamped by overzealous press coverage. ''The Cave,'' a multimedia work by Steve Reich and Beryl Korot that arrived a few years ago, met that problem head-on by making the elaborate promotion for the event seem more a work of art than the work itself.</p>
        <p>Reading reviews of premieres should be done with equal parts of hope and suspicion. It's nice for a critic to have his thoughts in print, but all of us secretly fear an updated edition of Nicolas Slonimsky's ''Lexicon of Musical Invective'' in which some new and asinine journalistic response to greatness will bear our name. Critics who fancy themselves makers of taste or creators of opinion take a lot on themselves. Better, we are reporters with a point of view. When you read through our ears, we are pleased. But what is good and beautiful has nothing to do with us. It passes direct from music to listener, no middleman involved.</p>
