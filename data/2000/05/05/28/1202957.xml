        <p>When the votes are tallied in New Jersey's Democratic Senate primary on June 6, the only people with almost as much at stake as the candidates are the pollsters at Quinnipiac College.</p>
        <p>Quinnipiac is a small liberal arts institution in Hamden, Conn., but it's a safe bet that most New Jerseyans pronounce its name Quinnipiac College Poll, since the school is best known here for the public opinion polls its political science department frequently makes public.</p>
        <p>In the high-profile contest between former Gov. Jim Florio and Jon S. Corzine, Quinnipiac is the only independent pollster measuring voter opinions, and its conclusions are causing a stir in political circles.</p>
        <p>After months of results showing Mr. Corzine -- a political unknown with a $400 million campaign war chest thanks to his years at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company -- slowly chipping away at Mr. Florio's lead,  Quinnipiac released a poll on May 10 showing Mr. Corzine with a 15-point lead. The results stunned both camps because at the time, their own internal polls showed Mr. Corzine with only about a 6 percentage point lead.</p>
        <p>Undeterred by the skeptical coverage those numbers received in the media, Quinnipiac came out with more stunning numbers last Thursday. The poll said Mr. Corzine's lead was 56-30 percent -- a whopping 26 points -- at a time when both camps said internal polls showed a 10-point lead for Mr. Corzine.</p>
        <p>Predictably, the Florio campaign tried to play down the numbers, calling the results flawed and accusing the college of trying to manipulate the race (but even Mr. Florio's imaginative handlers could not come up with a good explanation of why a college in Connecticut would want to sway a New Jersey primary).</p>
        <p>Somewhat more surprising was the response of the Corzine campaign, which publicly proclaimed that the race was far closer than the Quinnipiac numbers suggested.</p>
        <p>''Jon Corzine is ahead,'' said Steven Goldstein, Mr. Corzine's co-campaign manager, ''but certainly not that far ahead.''</p>
        <p>Scott McLean, a political science professor at Quinnipiac and a spokesman for the poll, said he stood by the numbers. Mr. McLean also suggested that both campaigns had their own reasons to publicly underestimate Mr. Corzine's advantage.</p>
        <p>''Obviously the Florio camp wants to attack the results of this poll, because it's horrible for them,'' said Mr. McLean. ''And the Corzine people don't want to get complacent because they're afraid people might not come out to vote if they think it's already safely in the bag. And, as we're careful to note, Florio could still win this race.''</p>
        <p>If Mr. McLean and his associates are right, and Mr. Corzine wins handily, there will be celebrating in Hamden. But if Mr. Florio wins, or even comes close, Mr. McLean will have to do some fancy dancing to explain how things could change so much so fast. The worrisome thing for the school is that a lot can change between now and June 6.</p>
        <p>For one thing, the polling ended on May 23, the day before Mr. Florio broadcast his first television ad. According to Quinnipiac's own numbers, Mr. Corzine's ascent didn't begin until he began broadcasting negative ads. Mr. Florio's three ads, and the fourth ad being bought by supporters in the Camden County Democratic organization, are relentlessly critical of Mr. Corzine.</p>
        <p>New Jersey's hot-blooded and unpredictable voters also have a history of leaving pollsters red-faced on Election Day.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Florio's last statewide election -- his governor's race against Christine Todd Whitman in 1993 -- virtually every poll showed Mr. Florio with a sizeable lead in the last weeks of the campaign. A New York Times poll on Oct. 15 showed Mr. Florio with a 15-point lead, and surveys by The Record and The Star-Ledger said Mr. Florio was ahead by 10 points the week before Election Day. Mrs. Whitman won by 1 percent, leaving pollsters with plenty of explaining to do.</p>
        <p>Virtually every pollster acknowledges that primaries are even harder to predict than general elections because turnout is so low and respondents are notoriously undependable in reporting whether they will actually vote. So despite the intense interest in this race nationwide, The Record issued only one poll, in March. Pollsters for The Star-Ledger said primary polls were so unreliable they would wait until the general election to enter the fray.</p>
        <p>''We thought that if we're not sure we can do it well, we don't want to inject a false dynamic into the race,'' said Cliff Zukin, director of The Star-Ledger-Eagleton Rutgers Poll.</p>
        <p>But Doug Schwartz, the polling director at Quinnipiac, said he was confident that his methods were sound and his results accurate. Despite complaints from the Florio camp that the poll did not do enough to screen out people unlikely to vote, Mr. Schwartz said that he also pointed out that in the 14 races since 1996, Quinnipiac's final poll accurately predicted the winner.</p>
        <p>And while Mr. Schwartz insisted that any poll was just a snapshot in time -- and conceding that the gap between the candidates was almost certain to change between now and the primary -- Mr. Schwartz said he thought it was unfair to criticize the college's efforts.</p>
        <p>''I think we're doing a public service by putting independent numbers out there and giving the public a sense of where the race is going,'' Mr. Schwartz said. ''If we weren't willing to stick our neck out and do it, the only thing the media and the public would have to go on is polls from the campaigns. And ask yourself, would you believe any of them?''</p>
