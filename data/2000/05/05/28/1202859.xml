        <p>IF Jason Somerfeld hadn't been home that weekend morning, he might still be living in his studio apartment, longing for something better.</p>
        <p>Mr. Somerfeld had spent 18 months fruitlessly shopping for a two-bedroom apartment. He had moved into his studio at 300 West 23rd Street in 1990 as a new graduate of the Fashion Institute of Technology, and he was ready for a more grownup place. But every two-bedroom he saw was too expensive, and moving to a one-bedroom seemed like a marginal improvement.</p>
        <p>Then, one Sunday morning about two years ago, he heard noise, a lot of it, downstairs. He called the doorman to ask what was going on, knowing there had to be some explanation; he lived in a 20-story co-op that has rules about when people could renovate, or move in and out. Weekends are supposed to be quiet.</p>
        <p>''The doorman said they were cleaning out that apartment,'' Mr. Somerfeld said. ''The guy who was living there just never came back. The bank foreclosed.'' He was astonished to hear that someone had simply gone, walked away from everything. When he got over his astonishment, he realized that the man's disappearance might be his route to a larger apartment.</p>
        <p>Within 10 days he had a signed contract to pay $50,000 in cash for the studio below his, a low price because the bank wanted to sell quickly. His apartment, identical to the one below, had cost him $90,000 eight years before. Before closing, Mr. Somerfeld received assurances from the board that if he followed the required procedures, it would approve joining the two apartments, making it the first duplex in the building.</p>
        <p>FOR the first year, he sublet the apartment and took his time to figure out a plan. He hired an architect, Laszlo Kiss of Kiss + Zwigard of Manhattan, and told him he wanted a clean but comfortable look. ''I wanted the place to be really slick, but not trendy,'' he said, ''with great materials.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Somerfeld originally thought it would cost him about $80,000 to renovate the two studios, but he eventually spent about twice that. But for a total investment of $300,000, he has an apartment that has been appraised at $595,000. His monthly maintenance is $785.</p>
        <p>Mr. Somerfeld, 32, travels often for his work. He directs the buyers of women's clothing for Cohoes, a chain of stores in upstate New York and New England that sells upscale clothing for men and women. When he is home, he now has the place he always wanted.</p>
        <p>The dominant feel is of wood and steel, materials he likes because he considers them masculine and classic. The apartment is entered through his former studio, which has a large room with an open kitchen, where the cabinets are made of what appears to be mahogany. On closer inspection they turn out to be medium density fiberboard, artfully covered with a tinted lacquer. The same wood is used in the nearby ceiling, to unify the space.</p>
        <p>The kitchen has the regulation stainless SubZero refrigerator; more unusual, even for a lover of steel, is the stainless-steel toilet in the upstairs bath. ''I loved it and I insisted on it,'' he said. ''It was, like, $3,000, and they had to redo the plumbing.'' He first saw it in Milan, at the Prada store.</p>
        <p>The staircase that joins the two studios is dazzling: fronted by a glass wall, made of stainless steel, and next to a wall covered in subtly designed paper, it is like a sculpture in the space. Downstairs, the same rich-looking wood from the kitchen is used on a wall that is the focus of the office area he has carved out next to the bedroom. The duplex is probably as large as many two bedrooms, though it has only one.</p>
        <p>When the renovation started, he moved to the Chelsea Hotel, where he had lived for more than three years as a student at F.I.T. ''It was a great experience living there again,'' he said. Although quite different. ''I wasn't walking in at 4 in the morning with a hangover from Nell's,'' he said. ''I was up at 7, doing yoga.''</p>
        <p>The hotel, he said, has been transformed from his days there as a student. It still draws the legendary mix of artists, celebrities and downtown eccentrics, but, he said, it is classier and cleaner, with many newly renovated rooms.</p>
        <p>When he first saw the hotel as a 19-year-old from Harbor Isle, Long Island, looking for off-campus housing, he said, he immediately disliked it. ''I was this sheltered kid who would come into the city and go to the Upper East Side,'' he said. ''I went into the Chelsea Hotel and I totally did not get it. I saw a room and I just left.'' It had a dank smell, he said, with old carpeting.</p>
        <p>His mother persuaded him to give it another look. ''She said, 'There's history there, it's wonderful.' '' He ended up living there quite happily, and with his roommate at the time persuaded management to help pay for a renovation of their room, with new paint, carpeting and furniture.</p>
        <p>About six weeks ago, he left the Chelsea Hotel and moved back to his place. It is quite empty, because he gave away his couch, loveseat and coffee table. ''It wasn't me anymore,'' he said. ''It was an 80's big leather couch. Now I want something comfortable, and understated.''</p>
        <p>Although he didn't literally move, he feels as if he has. He still sees the same view, of a church whose stained-glass windows are lit from within at night. And he is still on 23rd Street, where he has lived since arriving in the city to attend school. But, he said, the renovation was totally transformative.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't feel like my old apartment,'' he said. ''The space is totally unfamiliar to me.''</p>
