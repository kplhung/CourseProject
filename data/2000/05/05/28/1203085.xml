        <p>If Thomas K. Lewis Jr. always wanted to be the sole chief executive of a prominent, fast-growing company, Tuesday was his lucky day. If, however, he did not want that company's stock price to be at a 52-week low and falling as analysts retooled their earnings forecasts into projected losses, then it was not so lucky.</p>
        <p>For more than a year, Mr. Lewis, 47, had shared the chief executive title at Ameritrade Holding with the electronic brokerage firm's founder and majority owner, J. Joe Ricketts, 58. In that time, Ameritrade's stock price has plunged more than 70 percent from its high in July 1999 to its low of $11 on Friday.</p>
        <p>With technology stocks in a deep slump, the active traders attracted by Ameritrade's $8 commissions have cut back on their trading. The sharp decline in trading volume in the last several weeks spells trouble for all brokerage firms, but none so much as the slim-commission electronic trading firms like Ameritrade.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewis, who officially succeeded Mr. Ricketts on Tuesday, described electronic brokerage firms that had branched out into banking and other services as ''broad and shallow.'' By contrast, he said, Ameritrade will ''stay intensely focused on the self-directed investor.''</p>
        <p>But in a long market downturn, that narrow focus could prove painful, analysts say. ''It's the companies that are the most transaction-dependent that get hurt the most,'' said Amy Butte, an analyst for Bear, Stearns.</p>
        <p>Unlike bigger rivals like TD Waterhouse and E*Trade Group, Ameritrade has remained focused on providing cheap, fast trades over the Internet. It has signed up more than a million customers, many of them lured in by its big-budget ad campaign featuring a computer-savvy character named Stuart.</p>
        <p>Jeffrey Wrona, manager of the PBHG Technology and Communications fund, sold all of the Ameritrade shares in his fund earlier this year. ''I didn't see the competitive landscape changing for the better for any of these e-brokers,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wrona started buying shares of Ameritrade in the fourth quarter of 1999 because, he said, he was certain that the rising volume of stock trading late last year would result in strong earnings for electronic brokerage firms. He was right: Ameritrade and E*Trade posted slight profits last quarter. But he also thought that would reverse the long slide in their stock prices that started a year ago. On that score, he said, ''I was dead wrong.''</p>
        <p>Investors feared the online brokers were engaged in a nonstop marketing battle that would eat up most or all of their profits. Ameritrade is spending $200 million on advertising and promotion this fiscal year and plans to spend $250 million next year.</p>
        <p>''People want to see profits -- and now,'' said Richard Strauss, a Goldman, Sachs analyst. ''And even if they see profits -- and now -- they're not necessarily going to be convinced in this market environment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Strauss, a longtime bull on Charles Schwab's stock, recently told clients that TD Waterhouse, the discount brokerage arm of Toronto Dominion Bank, was worth considering as an alternative. He has not recommended buying Ameritrade or E*Trade, even at their depressed levels.</p>
        <p>Analysts who have been recommending those stocks spent last week revising estimates of how much they will earn, based on expectations that the number of trades executed through those firms during the current quarter will be at least 20 percent lower than last quarter. Earnings should drop in step with revenue because the firms are not cutting back on their marketing.</p>
        <p>Ameritrade reported net income of 2 cents a share last quarter. Matthew Vetto, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, now expects it to lose 3 cents a share this quarter, instead of earning 2 cents, and expects it to add 205,000 accounts in the quarter, down from his previous estimate of 240,000. He expects E*Trade to break even this quarter and to add about 300,000 accounts.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Vetto rates Ameritrade a better buy than E*Trade and E*Trade a better buy than DLJdirect, the online brokerage arm of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. DLJdirect is less attractive, he says, because it is smaller and not as well known as the others.</p>
        <p>BLACK of scale will pose a growing problem for these firms as traditional brokerage firms, including Merrill Lynch, and banks start promoting their new online services, analysts say. Ms. Butte points to the recent sale by National Discount Brokers of a stake to Deutsche Bank of Germany as recognition of that looming threat.</p>
        <p>TD Waterhouse and DLJdirect have parents with deep pockets, and most analysts believe that Schwab, with a market capitalization of $31 billion, is big enough to remain independent. But some think the smaller firms, including E*Trade and Ameritrade, will have to merge to survive.</p>
        <p>Ameritrade's stock jumped in late March on speculation that Mr. Ricketts might sell the company. But those takeover hopes dissipated as trading activity cooled well before the market's usual summer slowdown. Not even the announcement this week that Mr. Ricketts plans to start unloading his huge stake by selling 20 million shares could rekindle investor interest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewis waves off talk of a buyout, saying, ''We don't have any serious discussions about that.'' Besides, he says, to appease Ameritrade's shareholders, a buyer ''would have to pay such a premium.''</p>
        <p>Still, says Steve Galbraith, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, it may be about time for opportunistic buyers to take notice of electronic brokerages. ''The sentiment on these things shifts so extremely that if they get sold down too much more, they could represent decent value.''</p>
