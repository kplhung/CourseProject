        <p>Last Thursday morning at 5:15, a gray mass of pigeons walked wing to wing across several concrete paving stones while downing their daily meal: five pounds of birdseed freshly spread on the Rabbi Kirshblum Traffic Triangle at Main Street and 73rd Terrace.</p>
        <p>Once full, many of the birds flew across the street to the plane trees surrounding Freedom Square, a city park that has a playground at one end.</p>
        <p>And that is a problem, say local residents, who say these fattened-up pigeons sometimes splatter droppings on children who use the park.</p>
        <p>Shari Weiss recalled the day in 1998 that her son, Ephraim, received an award at a park event.</p>
        <p>''During the ceremony he was hit by bird droppings about eight times,'' she said, adding that he has been hit several times since then.</p>
        <p>''We all have,'' she said. ''Everybody who uses the park.''</p>
        <p>Local officials say the early-morning feedings have been taking place for at least two years. In January 1999, the city's parks police issued two summonses to a woman who had put out birdseed in the park, an action that violated the posted regulations.</p>
        <p>''We abhor the feeding because the pigeon population proliferates,'' Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern said. ''Also, the food left out for pigeons is equally delicious to rats.''</p>
        <p>Quoting from one of the summonses, he continued: ''The woman acts out of religious conviction. She believes that some of her relatives have been reincarnated as pigeons.''</p>
        <p>The woman named on the summonses, Nawal Bhanwarlah, could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>Pat Dolan, president of the Kew Gardens Hills Civic Association, said that the woman who had received the summonses simply moved her feeding activity from the park to the traffic triangle, where she is beyond the reach of Parks Department enforcement.</p>
        <p>''The flock has continued to grow tremendously over the years,'' said Ms. Dolan, who lives a block from the park and said she could hardly remember a day when she had not seen a long line of birdseed on the triangle.</p>
        <p>But the benefactor of the flocks might be risking a summons from the city's Department of Health. John Gadd, a department spokesman, said the seed drops might be producing a ''nuisance condition of excessive bird droppings'' that could warrant a summons. The department plans to send an inspector to the site soon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern has his own theories about pigeon feeders. ''They are lonely people whose only audience is pigeons,'' he said. ''And the only way to attract them is with seed or bread. But we have to clean up after them.''</p>
