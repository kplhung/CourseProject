        <p>For the past two years, Wali Collins, an actor and comedian, has been joining friends in Central Park each weekend for a rare kind of conversation. He plays the djembe, a Senegalese drum, and he meets with others who play different African ''talking drums,'' which call fans to Bethesda Fountain.</p>
        <p>To some, the African drummers, who have played in the park for many years, are as integral a feature of park life as the fountain itself. But Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern said some park patrons had begun to complain about them.</p>
        <p>''The noise is very loud, intended to travel long distances as a means of communication,'' he said. ''There is an involuntary audience of thousands of people who are in the park for peace and quiet.''</p>
        <p>So this year there is a crackdown on the Central Park drummers. ''They've turned up the heat all of a sudden,'' said Kendall Williams, the coordinator of the group. ''In the five years I've been out there, as far as I know, this has never happened before.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern said that park officials told drummers in early May that their actions were illegal, and then parks police issued summonses. The drummers said they thought they had been asked to leave the fountain area, and on May 13 gathered near the Naumberg Band Shell instead. That day, parks and police officers confiscated several drums and issued four summonses. Mr. Stern said more summonses would be issued if the drummers did not comply.</p>
        <p>''It makes me angry,'' Mr. Collins said. ''If you're just expressing yourself and there's no alcohol or drugs or lewd behavior involved, and so many people are enjoying themselves, why stop it?''</p>
