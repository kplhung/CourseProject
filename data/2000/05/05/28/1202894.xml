        <p>Joseph McBride letter disputes Midge Mackenzie's April 16 article contending that John Huston's San Pietro and Let There Be Light are only films ever banned by War Departmentï¿½</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>John Huston's ''San Pietro'' and ''Let There Be Light'' were not ''the only films ever banned by the War Department,'' as Ms. Mackenzie claims. Other United States government documentaries suppressed during or shortly after World War II include the long version of John Ford's ''December 7th,'' Frank Capra's ''Know Your Enemy -- Japan'' and ''Our Job in Japan'' and Huston's own ''Report From the Aleutians.''</p>
        <p>Ronald Haver, film curator at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, gave ''Let There Be Light'' its first public screening at a Huston retrospective in 1980. The military made no effort to prevent Haver's unauthorized but advertised screening. I reviewed ''Let There Be Light'' for Daily Variety, and called for its declassification by the Department of the Army. Ray Stark and Jack Valenti offered their support and began lobbying efforts of their own.</p>

        <p>A sympathetic Army officer who became involved asked why I had not also made an issue of the banned status of ''Report From the Aleutians.'' It had been banned, he told me, because Huston inadvertently showed a classified bomb site. That was a moot issue by 1980, and the officer said a simple request would allow the ban to be lifted.</p>
        <p>While Vice President Walter Mondale indeed played a critical role in the campaign to free the more controversial ''Let There Be Light'' for public viewing, it was not Mr. Mondale who declassified that film, as Ms. Mackenzie reports. The credit belongs to Secretary of the Army Clifford Alexander, who officially declassified both ''Let There Be Light'' and ''Report From the Aleutians.''</p>

        <p>JOHN HUSTON  Correction:  June 11, 2000, Sunday  Because of an editing error, a letter to the editor on May 28 about suppressed documentaries referred incorrectly to the reason John Huston's ''Report From the Aleutians'' was banned. The letter writer was told that Huston had inadvertently showed a classified bomb sight, not bomb site.</p>
