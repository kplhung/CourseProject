        <p>Technology continued to bear the brunt of investors' worries about rising interest rates.</p>
        <p>And once again, the issue was the corporate bottom line. While higher rates hurt earnings by raising borrowing costs, investors feel technology companies will suffer most from the Federal Reserve's tightening, since many of them already have slim profits.</p>
        <p>Last week, investors shed more technology issues believed to be overvalued, and even the more established companies like Motorola, Cisco and Oracle. Also feeling the heat from the Fed's last rate increase earlier this month was the financial sector, including Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch. The concern is that higher rates and Wall Street's weakness will hurt their profits.</p>
        <p>Hugh Johnson, the chief investment strategist for First Albany, said investors are sticking with safer sectors like pharmaceuticals, consumer products, utilities and food retailers. Investors have become very defensive, he said.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index, laden with technology, ended the week at 3,205.11, down 185.9 points. The Dow Jones industrial average ended at 10,299.24, down 327.61.</p>
