        <p>WHEN people in New London say ''Hygienic,'' they're usually not speaking of scrubbing their hands. They're referring to the Hygienic Building, a downtown landmark that dates to 1844.</p>
        <p>Thanks to a remarkable grass-roots effort, the old building is now the Hygienic Artist Cooperative and Galleries. There, on a recent Saturday morning, volunteers briskly changed exhibits, while the six artists who live upstairs in co-op apartments gathered for a meeting.</p>
        <p>A. Vincent Scarano, the president of Hygienic Art Inc., took a visitor around. After checking the second floor, which has two apartments, he kept climbing, to reach the four third-floor apartments with their sleeping lofts and bathrooms in what was once the attic. He pointed out features of the apartments, from original fireplace surrounds to brand new kitchens, in apartments that rent for $400 to $475 a month.</p>
        <p>The freshly renovated Hygienic (which got its name from a restaurant that opened there in 1929) is a place where artists can afford to live and work, and where galleries aim to draw all kinds of people, not just regular gallerygoers.</p>
        <p>''It could be a model for other cities,'' Mr. Scarano said. But a while back, he recalled, ''Nobody ever thought it would happen.''</p>
        <p>Local artists used to hang out at the grubby (but welcoming) Hygienic Restaurant, and in 1979 they held the Hygienic Art Show there. The show had the motto ''No judge, no jury, no censorship, no fees!''</p>
        <p>When the lively anti-establishment show turned into a popular annual event, the artists organized into Hygienic Art Inc. to run it. After the restaurant closed in 1985, they moved the show to other spots around the city, but they always treasured the old building, with its distinctive flatiron front. So did preservationists.</p>
        <p>In 1996 a bank announced plans to buy the Hygienic, which was by then a boarded-up eyesore, and to demolish it to create parking space. Horrified admirers rallied to gain an injunction, and, in 1997, after much negotiating, Hygienic Art members made a deal to buy and rehabilitate the building.</p>
        <p>Up until then, the group's treasurer, James Stidfole said, ''We had an annual budget of $2,200. For developing a building, we had the credibility of a gerbil.''</p>
        <p>Hygienic Art signed a contract with Christopher Widmer, an architect and the executive director of Alderhouse Residential Communities (who had already developed a limited-equity cooperative nearby) to renovate the Hygienic for nonprofit galleries and affordable apartments for artists.</p>
        <p>The Hygienic's four galleries include three on the first floor and one in what was the basement. The main gallery still has the restaurant's 1950's lunch counter and stools, where visitors often sit and talk.</p>
        <p>''This is not intimidating space, like a stuffy gallery,'' Mr. Scarano said. ''It's part of the community, common ground. It makes art accessible.''</p>
        <p>The apartments, each about 1,000 square feet, have features for artists: big doors for ease of moving  art, lots of light, extra sinks and easy-to-clean wooden floors.</p>
        <p>''I love the fact that I have a good place to work,'' said Broderick Price, a painter who has been making tables of varied sizes for his apartment out of materials left from construction. ''The whole building is a work of art.''</p>
        <p>The completed renovation cost about $800,000, including $105,000 to buy the building. The state contributed $250,000; the city of New London, $142,000; the Fannie Mae Corporation, $10,000. Private foundations, businesses and groups contributed, and Hygienic Art raised about $275,000, including $100,000 in tax credits from the Connecticut Housing Finance Authority.</p>
        <p>The group even held an auction where people bid not only on art but also on Mr. Stidfole's mop of gray hair, which was sheared off for $5,500.</p>
        <p>From the start, ordinary people in and around the city contributed time, money, materials and elbow grease.</p>
        <p>Actual renovation began in January 1999, under the construction manager Paul McMasters. But the regular carpenters, sheetrock workers and other crews couldn't start until volunteers spent six weeks cleaning everything, from old furniture to dead pigeons, out of the building.</p>
        <p>''Six weeks, eight big Dumpsters, 190 cubic yards,'' Mr. Stidfole said of the clean-up. He noted that volunteers worked throughout the project, doing whatever was needed. Some people, he said, ''just walked in off the street and said, 'Can I help?' ''</p>
        <p>Volunteers are still coming forward to help, he said, and others offer gifts.</p>
        <p>Last summer brought one of the most notable features of the renovation project, the women on the wall. Working on scaffolding on the south wall of the building, Terry (Davo) Davis, a Hygienic artist, and his assistants, Sarah Warda and Wendy Kuklinski, painted a 30-by-50-foot mural featuring five women, partially draped, who represent caryatids, sculptured female forms that appear to serve as architectural supports.</p>
        <p>The galleries opened in late January with the annual Hygienic Art Show, back at the place where it started. As usual, it allowed one work per artist and included a wide variety, from sensitive watercolors to toilet bowls as art. A more conventional show came next.</p>
        <p>The most recent show was called ''Handkerchief Art from Prison.'' Mr. Stidfole explained that inmates can buy handkerchiefs cheaply at prison commissaries, draw or paint on them, then fold them (without making lasting creases) and mail them to people outside. Such work is attracting academic attention, he said, and the Hygienic displayed more than 100 examples, some with matching envelopes.</p>
        <p>Hygienic Art Inc. will soon turn the building (its only debt is a $105,000 mortgage and a $90,000 low-interest bank loan) over to a new corporation, Hygienic Art Cooperative Inc. Each of the six residents will be a voting member; Hygienic Art Inc., which operates the galleries, will be a voting member.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scarano noted that all too often artists move into affordable areas that soon become unaffordable. In New London, downtown property is becoming more expensive, but under the co-op arrangement, participants can manage the Hygienic, set rents, and not be squeezed out, he said.</p>
        <p>The resident artists, who moved in in February, must have incomes under $29,500 when they move in, put cash and sweat equity into their apartments, participate in a co-op training program, work some hours in the galleries, and exhibit their work in group and individual shows. They sign no lease but agree to follow the co-op rules for as long as they reside there. The residents all needed to finish and paint their apartments, as part of their sweat equity, before concentrating on their art.</p>
        <p>Tekla Zweir, a sculptor who graduated last year from the Lyme Academy of Fine Art, pointed out the woodwork that she had just stained, with the help of a friend. ''Now I've started working on this quilt-and-figure series,'' she said, describing her plans for relief sculptures with smooth figures against textured quilts.</p>
        <p>The artists will have a group show in June and individual shows at later times. Mr. Price, the table-making painter, is already planning his December retrospective, which will cover some 30 years of his work and include written pieces as well.</p>
        <p>Life-drawing classes are under way, with still more activities being considered, such as a playwriting workshop and a drumming group. Jenn Collins, a Hygienic resident, has suggested a fall show of installations by and about the women of New London, women of all ages, races, social and economic levels.</p>
        <p>''It's cool to live here,'' said Ms. Collins, who designed and made decorative elements for the recent renovation of the Garde Theater, just a few blocks away. ''We've got an opportunity to create the scene.''</p>
        <p>The Hygienic Galleries, 79-83 Bank Street, New London, are open Thursday and Friday, 4 to 7 p.m.; Saturday, noon to 10 p.m., and Sunday, noon to 6 p.m. The galleries' Web site is www.hygienic.org.</p>
