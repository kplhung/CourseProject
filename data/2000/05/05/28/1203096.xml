        <p>IN a city aswarm with new restaurants clamoring for recognition, the National Rifle Association managed to clear one hurdle with ease. Back in May 2000, it caught the public's attention by announcing plans to open a theme restaurant, the N.R.A. Sports Grille, in Times Square. Now, a year later, for the second hurdle: can it win the hearts, minds and, most important, the stomachs of a gun-shy city eaters?</p>
        <p>If nothing else, the Sports Grille will give them plenty to talk about. Diners used to passing a velvet-rope barrier now face a new obstacle: a metal detector that identifies patrons who have forgotten to bring a sidearm. Once issued with a loaner, the diners may want to stop for a Ruby Ridge cocktail at the Minuteman Bar, or proceed straight to the Charlton Heston Room, a soaring space decorated with stills from the actor's finest performances, although one, from ''The Ten Commandments,'' seems to be an outtake (I am certain that the stone tablets never referred to the right to bear arms).</p>

        <p>IN a city aswarm with new restaurants clamoring for recognition, the National Rifle Association managed to clear one hurdle with ease. Back in May 2000, it caught the public's attention by announcing plans to open a theme restaurant, the N.R.A. Sports Grille, in Times Square. Now, a year later, for the second hurdle: can it win the hearts, minds and, most important, the stomachs of a gun-shy city eaters?</p>
        <p>If nothing else, the Sports Grille will give them plenty to talk about. Diners used to passing a velvet-rope barrier now face a new obstacle: a metal detector that identifies patrons who have forgotten to bring a sidearm. Once issued with a loaner, the diners may want to stop for a Ruby Ridge cocktail at the Minuteman Bar, or proceed straight to the Charlton Heston Room, a soaring space decorated with stills from the actor's finest performances, although one, from ''The Ten Commandments,'' seems to be an outtake (I am certain that the stone tablets never referred to the right to bear arms).</p>
        <p>The menu at the Sports Grille, billed as ''110 percent American cuisine,'' relies heavily on game, and here diners need to exercise caution. It is one thing to pick your way through the buckshot in a Scottish grouse, and quite another to work your way around the bullets from an AK-47 assault rifle. But it's a small price to pay for authenticity. Most dishes on the menu are identified not only by place of origin, but also by manner of death. My Texas antelope, for example, was brought down at 1,500 feet by Edward (Buddy) Barnes, using a Weatherby MarkV Super VarmintMaster. It was tender and flavorful, so fresh it was nearly twitching. A hefty slab of Montana elk, however, had a distinctly metallic taste, not surprising considering that the animal was picked off from a helicopter by five men wielding Uzis.</p>
        <p>At Sports Grille, diners learn that shooting fish in a barrel is no mere expression. The management, seeing the runaway success of Greek restaurants in which customers personally pick out their fish for dinner, have gone the extra step, and allowed customers to choose a fish and then finish it off. It does add a certain thrill to the meal. Salmon may be fighters, but I can tell you that one Teflon-coated bullet from a Smith and Wesson Baby Sigma makes them fold up pretty quickly. Although the emphasis is on meat dishes, I found the fish to be first rate at the Sports Grille, and I can particularly recommend the subtle and intriguing Congressional Special: weakfish prepared tableside, where an N.R.A. lobbyist removes the backbone with no difficulty whatsoever.</p>
        <p>The Sports Grille is a cheery, high-energy restaurant, although conversation is made difficult by a soundtrack booming out inspirational messages from the N.R.A. executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, against a background of small-arms fire.</p>
        <p>Tipping is also a problem. How do you leave less than 20 percent to a waiter in camouflage gear carrying a Glock 9-millimeter pistol and 1,000 rounds of ammunition?</p>
        <p>''Can I take that for you?'' my server asked, reaching for my credit card. I snatched it back and said, smiling, ''The only way you'll get is it to pry it from my cold, dead fingers.'' He didn't laugh. In fact, his eyes narrowed, and I can swear I saw his hand move toward his gun.</p>
        <p>It's that kind of place.</p>
        <p>N.R.A. Sports Grille  ** [Rating: Two Stars]</p>
        <p>ATMOSPHERE: Bellicose.</p>
        <p>SOUND LEVEL: Deafening.</p>
        <p>RECOMMENDED DISHES: Stuffed shells.</p>
        <p>SERVICE: Definitely not disarming.</p>
        <p>WINE LIST: 110 percent American.</p>
        <p>HOURS: Opens at high noon.</p>
        <p>WHAT THE STARS MEAN:</p>
        <p>(None) Poor to satisfactory  * Good  ** Very good  *** Marksman  **** Sharpshooter</p>
        <p>Ratings reflect the reviewer's reaction to food, ambience, service and high anxiety.</p>
