        <p>FUELED by favorable demographic trends, strong consumer demand and a robust economy, the assisted-living industry was supposed to be mounting record profits this year while expanding rapidly and reaching new stock market peaks.

        <p>FUELED by favorable demographic trends, strong consumer demand and a robust economy, the assisted-living industry was supposed to be mounting record profits this year while expanding rapidly and reaching new stock market peaks. That, at least, is what analysts were predicting three years ago.</p>
        <p>It has not exactly worked out that way. One publicly traded company -- Grand Court Lifestyles Inc., in Boca Raton, Fla. -- filed for bankruptcy protection in March. Several others are under financial strain, and most have seen their shares recently plunge to record lows.</p>
        <p>New construction has all but stopped. The Alterra Healthcare Corporation of Milwaukee, the nation's largest assisted-living operator, has abandoned plans to build 100 new homes. Last year, the industry's publicly traded companies, which account for 10 percent of the homes, lost 68 percent of their value, according to Philip J. Martin, an analyst with First Union Securities.</p>
        <p>What went wrong? The answer is a binge of overinvestment and overbuilding, with too many companies trying to seize a trend.</p>
        <p>The elderly are the fastest-growing segment of the population; the number of Americans 85 or older is expected to increase by one-third in the next decade, to about six million. Most dread the prospect of being confined to the hospital-like setting of a nursing home.</p>
        <p>Privately paid assisted living is viewed as an appealing alternative for people who need some help but do not require skilled nursing. Residents have their own apartments with kitchens, eating communally and taking part in social activities only when they want to. Public areas are designed to evoke a comfortable hotel rather than an institution.</p>
        <p>Experts in senior housing say the industry's poor financial performance has not discredited assisted living, any more than the slide in dot-com stocks has undermined the Internet. They cite a gold-rush fever that led some companies to grow too fast and to use creative (though legal) accounting methods to hide their losses.</p>
        <p>The concept of assisted living has existed for about two decades, but as recently as 1994, the industry had only two publicly traded companies. As capital became widely available, about 20 more public offerings followed, including some for companies operating both assisted-living and nursing homes. That resulted in pressure to produce quick increases in earnings.</p>
        <p>In contrast to nursing homes, assisted-living homes face few regulatory barriers. New residences often went up with little market research.</p>
        <p>But many companies did not anticipate how long it would take to fill their buildings. The costs are beyond many people's means. Monthly fees start at $3,000 in lower-cost regions and climb sharply, depending on the services needed -- with medical care usually extra. Also, many elderly people are reluctant to give up their independence.</p>
        <p>Some companies failed to foresee that they would be serving an increasingly older, and therefore more frail clientele (the average age is now 84), forcing them to add staff, which cut into profits. ''There wasn't a lot of discipline on the part of the companies,'' said Christos Kuliopoulos, a senior consultant at Ernst &amp; Young who specializes in senior housing. ''They weren't doing their due diligence.''</p>
        <p>And so the building boom has tapered off. The 164 homes now under construction are just a third as many as were completed in 1998. There are about 7,000 professionally run homes nationwide, with about 520,000 units, according to the American Seniors Housing Association in Fairfax, Va.</p>
        <p>DURING the building boom, many markets quickly became saturated, prompting several states to require certificates of need before a home could be built. North Carolina has declared a moratorium on new construction, an action that backfired when many companies rushed into the state to beat the deadline.</p>
        <p>Confidence in the industry was also shaken when many companies chose to engage in so-called off-balance-sheet financing. Abraham Gosman, the chairman of the Care-Matrix Corporation, a publicly traded company based in Needham, Mass., used a private but wholly owned company, the Chancellor Senior Housing Group, to buy  property and absorb start-up losses. Chancellor paid CareMatrix a fee for developing the homes and running them in the early stages. As the homes filled up, CareMatrix would either lease them or buy them back.</p>
        <p>''They were moving money from one pocket to another pocket,'' said James J. Kumpel, an analyst at Raymond James &amp; Associates, who called attention to this financing arrangement at several companies. ''It was a cynical financing vehicle to promote hypergrowth in what is generally not a hypergrowth industry.''</p>
        <p>However, Louise T. Major, director of investor relations for CareMatrix, said this type of financing has been standard in the hotel industry for many years.</p>
        <p>Not all of the industry's problems have been of its own making. Changes in Medicare reimbursement methods for nursing homes also affected the prices of assisted-living stocks, because many investors do not  distinguish among various forms of senior housing, analysts say. Last year, the stocks tumbled after an analyst reported -- incorrectly, as it turned out -- that the Government Accounting Office was about to recommend federal regulation of assisted living.</p>
        <p>The industry is generally not opposed to regulation (it is easier to market government-certified homes), but it prefers to have it imposed by state lawmakers, who  are easier to lobby.</p>
        <p>As the industry faltered, even the better-managed companies saw their shares drop precipitously. These included Sunrise Assisted Living, Brookdale Living Communities and the American Retirement Corporation. The pioneer in assisted living, Sunrise, based in Fairfax, Va., opened its first home in 1981 and now has 148 homes in 23 states and one in Britain.</p>
        <p>Companies like these own their real estate, choose their locations carefully, usually in densely populated areas, and focus on their operations, said Kathryn A. Sweeney, a vice president at AEW Capital Management, a Boston company that invests in privately held assisted-living companies. ''Those firms that succeed as good operators will live in this business,'' she said. ''Those that entered the business as real estate developers -- for opportunistic reasons -- will not.''</p>
        <p>For these reasons, a shakeout could benefit consumers in the long run. It would force companies to shift their attention from development to management, said Don Redfoot, a senior policy adviser to AARP.</p>
        <p>But for now, families may want to exercise an extra measure of caution when choosing a home. ''The intense pressure to show profit margins created enormous pressures to keep staffing to a minimum,'' Mr. Redfoot said. ''You want to make sure that the place is adequately staffed.''</p>
