        <p>I am on the board of a geriatric health care institution that has been approached about accepting a contribution from a tobacco company. Some board members believe we cannot take tobacco money. Others say cigarette companies are legitimate businesses.

        <p>You should not accept this donation. Abetting the interests of a tobacco company conflicts with your avowed mission, health care, and thus betrays the trust of those who contribute to, or work for, your organization.</p>

        <p>I am on the board of a geriatric health care institution that has been approached about accepting a contribution from a tobacco company. Some board members believe we cannot take tobacco money. Others say cigarette companies are legitimate businesses. I don't think accepting this donation would promote smoking: few of our clients still smoke, and none are taking it up.</p>
        <p>What do you say? -- Anonymous, Toronto</p>
        <p>You should not accept this donation. Abetting the interests of a tobacco company conflicts with your avowed mission, health care, and thus betrays the trust of those who contribute to, or work for, your organization.</p>
        <p>It is not possible to demand absolute purity from donors; no such money exists. And there are gray areas, but tobacco is not one of them: here, in the</p>
        <p>United States, it kills 400,000 people a year. It is our prime public health problem, the most preventable cause of death. Do you or does your organization really want to have a stake in the profitability of cigarettes?</p>
        <p>While accepting this donation may not directly promote smoking, it would offer the tobacco company a mask of benevolence to conceal its primary aim: selling a toxic product. Some of your board members may not see it this way, but the company certainly does; hence its interest in associating with you. Furthermore, your declining its donation in no way impedes its ability to do good works, only its ability to shine in your reflected beneficence. If the tobacco company truly wants to help the elderly, rather than buff its image, it can always toss a paper bag full of crisp and anonymous thousand-dollar bills through your office window any time it wishes.</p>
        <p>There is one great thing about a health care organization's taking tobacco money: tobacco's money solves tobacco's problem. It supplies all the horribly ill people you could ever want -- and then provides money for treatment. The not-so-great thing: it is possible to be too ironic.</p>
        <p>I enjoy teaching music, but very rarely I have a student with absolutely no ability. My sister, a fellow musician, says it is unconscionable to keep taking money from these hopeless musical misfits. If I gently suggest that the harp is not the best instrument for everyone and the student still insists on continuing, am I morally obliged to terminate lessons? -- K.S., New York</p>
        <p>If your student asks your opinion of her talent, you owe her the truth. And certainly if she is contemplating a professional career, you must provide a candid assessment of her chances. But if she is pursuing music for the pleasure of it, then you're free to teach her as long as she enjoys (and you can tolerate) the lessons. Being a bad amateur musician is no worse than being a bad amateur golfer, or sitting around watching TV, or driving a bucket of balls into a TV (assuming it is your own TV).</p>
        <p>While your student may be guilty of aesthetic crimes, you are innocent of any ethical offense by continuing her lessons. You would, however, be committing a crime against good manners if you were to wear earplugs. Most music teachers consider it tactless.</p>
