        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I enjoyed ''Class Trips: A Survival Guide For Parents'' (Jersey, April 30). By my own reckoning, I've led  over 100 field trips. I have a few lessons to add to your primer. I've  found every bathroom in the Met and I've learned my weight on Mars, but the most important of my hard-won knowledge is this:</p>
        <p>Medication: Take your own Advil.  Veronica's uncle gave a vacation day to our zoo trip, but the noise and stress of sixth graders gave him a terrible headache. ''I'd rather be at work,'' he complained (his regular job: prison guard at Rikers Island), so we stopped the bus at Duane  Reade. He returned with extra-strength Advil and took two.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I enjoyed ''Class Trips: A Survival Guide For Parents'' (Jersey, April 30). By my own reckoning, I've led  over 100 field trips. I have a few lessons to add to your primer. I've  found every bathroom in the Met and I've learned my weight on Mars, but the most important of my hard-won knowledge is this:</p>
        <p>Medication: Take your own Advil.  Veronica's uncle gave a vacation day to our zoo trip, but the noise and stress of sixth graders gave him a terrible headache. ''I'd rather be at work,'' he complained (his regular job: prison guard at Rikers Island), so we stopped the bus at Duane  Reade. He returned with extra-strength Advil and took two.</p>
        <p>Stop at every bathroom and herd all of the children in. Then, follow  them and permit only the basic activities. If one kid starts primping,  you'll lose 45 minutes.</p>
        <p>Short on chaperones? Stick that bright orange Chaperone sticker on the tallest child you have. If it's one of the more challenging kids, even better. The other children will just look awed at the tall kid, and wonder at his or her new authority. (By the end of the day, they figure out that he or she has no power, but then you're back at school anyway.)</p>
        <p>Success, short term: Bringing back as many kids as you started with means you had a successful trip. ( Three bad times I didn't manage this. I didn't forget them anywhere; they just ran off in the subway station.)</p>
        <p>Success, long term: Like everything else we do for children, we question the point of a trip that seemed all bus, lunch and bathroom.  Sometimes, though, kids tell you. In 1993-1995, Iris was in my class. She visited the Museum of Natural History many times on class trips. She keeps in touch, and told me that she finally met Holden Caulfield by reading ''Catcher in the Rye.'' I taught her in Harlem, at a small alternative school. Her own adolescent experience couldn't be more unlike Holden's, but they share a history of trips to the museum. Iris didn't like much about Holden or the book, but she loved the descriptions of the museum. She wrote an essay about her museum trips -- and she got an A .</p>
        <p>Have you been to Washington, D.C., yet? Corraling them on the Mall -- or in Air and Space -- requires the skill of a sheepdog and the tracking ability of a bloodhound. And someone will get a bee sting. I hope it's not you.</p>
