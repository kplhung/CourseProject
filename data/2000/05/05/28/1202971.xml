        <p>A federal cleanup at Brookhaven National Laboratory should be accelerated to reduce its cost by about $18 million and remove contaminants sooner, Senator Charles E. Schumer said at a news conference at the laboratory.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schumer said he would lead efforts to convince Energy Secretary Bill Richardson of the economic and environmental advantages of halving the cleanup, to three years.</p>
        <p>The $18 million saving, Mr. Schumer said, would give the Energy Department more for cleanups at other laboratories while assuring that ''different plumes that are moving toward different water sources'' at Brookhaven were cleaned up more quickly.</p>
        <p>But it was unclear whether other labs engaged in cleanups, including Hanford, Wash., and Oak Ridge, Tenn., would support a plan that initially increased financing at Brookhaven. The 5,300-acre Brookhaven property is contaminated by radionuclides, metals and chemicals in the soil and ground water. The laboratory has been a federal Superfund site since 1989.</p>
        <p>The Energy Department budget currently includes nearly $261 million for the six-year cleanup, officials said. The cost of the three-year cleanup would be about $242 million, they said, with savings from lower overhead and management costs.</p>
        <p>The laboratory director, John H. Marburger, said the faster cleanup ''gets an issue off our backs that I think has been hampering us from making progress with the community and with our many constituents.'' The plan is also supported by a citizens advisory panel.</p>
        <p>But a laboratory critic, Scott Cullen, the legal counsel for Standing for Truth About Radiation (STAR) of East Hampton, said contamination was too extensive to be cleaned up in three years ''no matter how much money they get.''</p>
        <p>''It's a good idea to do the cleanup faster,'' he said. ''But if after three years they referred to the site as being cleaned, it won't be the case.''</p>
