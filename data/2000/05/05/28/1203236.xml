        <p>Indiana Pacers player Jalen Rose scores 26 points after slow start in game 3 of Eastern Conference Finals against New York Knickerbockers (S)</p>

        <p>After a poor start in which he missed eight of his first nine shots, Jalen Rose put on a fourth-quarter show that came close to becoming a horror flick for the Knicks. In a scoring spree that overshadowed Rik Smits's 21-point first-half, Rose scored 22 points in the final period.</p>
        <p>Rose, who finished with 26 points, made all 7 of his shots and 7 of 9 free throws in helping to shrink a 13-point deficit with 6:36 left to a 3-point hole with 4.7 seconds remaining. Rose scored the Pacers' first 6 points of the quarter, then scored 9 straight points in a two-minute run that began with 3:01 to play.</p>

Rose scored the Pacers' first 6 points of the quarter, then scored 9 straight points in a two-minute run that began with 3:01 to play.</p>
        <p>''I was being aggressive,'' said Rose, who made 8 of 16 shots and finished with 6 assists. ''I wasn't turning down anything and I wasn't going to give up on the game.''</p>
        <p>Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy joked that that was the strategy the Knicks used to slow down Smits, who scored just 4 of his 25 points in the second half. ''We let Rose score every time,'' Van Gundy said. ''We like tricked him.''</p>
        <p>Pacers G.M. to Meet Nets</p>
        <p>David Kahn, the Pacers' general manager, said on Friday that he has been speaking with YankeeNets officials about setting up an interview for the Nets' president/director of basketball operations position within the next week. Kahn, who was recommended to the Nets by Indiana president Donnie Walsh, said the holiday made it tough for the two parties to get together this weekend.</p>
        <p>Kahn initially had asked to postpone formal interviews until the end of the Pacers' season, but he said he understands the increased urgency on the Nets' part since they landed the No. 1 pick in the upcoming National Basketball Association draft.</p>
        <p>The Nets are also expected to interview Mitch Kupchak, the general manager of the Lakers, within the week.</p>
