        <p>Vice President Al Gore, speaking today at the United States Military Academy, criticized Gov. George W. Bush's support for a national missile defense system along with a possible one-sided reduction in American nuclear warheads.</p>
        <p>''An approach that combines serious unilateral reductions with an attempt to build a massive defensive system will create instability and thus undermine our security,'' Mr. Gore told the West Point graduates in a sun-splashed ceremony at the academy's Michie Stadium.</p>
        <p>''Nuclear unilateralism will hinder, rather than help, arms control,'' Mr. Gore said, before handing out diplomas to the 944 graduates who trooped across the stage in their dress uniforms and white gloves.</p>
        <p>Without mentioning Mr. Bush by name, Mr. Gore issued the most detailed rebuttal yet of the foreign policy address that Mr. Bush delivered in Washington on Tuesday. Again and again, Mr. Gore assailed the notion of one-sided arms reductions, a prospect that Mr. Bush had raised at an appearance with a cast of well-known Republican foreign policy leaders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore emphasized that reductions should be pursued within negotiations and the framework of existing arms control treaties.</p>
        <p>The vice president said that the Clinton administration was already negotiating for bilateral cuts in nuclear arms and was considering a limited missile defense, but said the kind of approach recommended by Mr. Bush was misguided.</p>
        <p>''Reductions alone do not guarantee stability,'' Mr. Gore said. ''It is how reductions are made and how they interact with defensive systems that makes the difference.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, who became a specialist in arms control after he was elected to Congress in the mid-1970's, said: ''Reductions have to be carried out in a way that reduces the risk of confrontation. If you're not careful, you could have a reduction of missiles and a more dangerous world.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's remarks were unmistakably pointed in criticism of the Bush speech, which called for a reduction -- possibly unilateral -- in American nuclear weapons combined with an expanded missile defense system.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has said he would pull out of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty if the Russians did not agree to adjust it after ''a reasonable amount of time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was invited to the academy in his capacity as vice president, and the speech was billed as an official vice presidential event, not a campaign appearance. As such, he told reporters on Friday night, his remarks on the academy grounds would not be ''political'' in nature. ''I will not make a partisan remark,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But his comments today were Mr. Gore's first in public since Mr. Bush made his proposal on Tuesday, and they were being written by the vice president and his longtime national security adviser, Leon Fuerth, as the vice presidential entourage flew to the Hudson Valley on Friday night aboard Air Force Two from a campaign appearance in Memphis.</p>
        <p>After today's speech, Mr. Fuerth and Louis Caldera, the secretary of the Army, who is a political appointee of the president, asserted that Mr. Gore's remarks today had not been political.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fuerth told reporters that the vice president's comments were based on his long-standing principles and the fact that President Clinton was going to Russia next week, and that they were not intended as a response to Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>''Everything he said about strategic stability and so on came straight out of things that he was writing and talking about in the House of Representatives and as a Senator when he first began to enter the field of arms control, and it is mainly triggered by the fact that the president is about to leave for Moscow in a matter of a few days to engage in exactly this set of issues,'' Mr. Fuerth told reporters after today's speech.</p>
        <p>''The speech is not political, the speech is policy-based,'' Mr. Fuerth said. ''The ideas that the vice president presented have been in his record for a very long time.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, Mr. Caldera, asked if the remarks did not violate West Point's policy of barring political speeches, said: ''Absolutely not. I think there was great care taken to make sure that this was not a political speech.''</p>
        <p>In Mr. Gore's discussion with reporters on Friday night on Air Force Two, he sharply criticized Mr. Bush's proposal. He said it would re-ignite the arms race, and by saying so, he seemed to ensure that his differences with Mr. Bush would be part of the news media's coverage today.</p>
        <p>Today, at the graduation exercise, Mr. Gore outlined the Clinton administration's efforts toward creating a national missile defense system that would protect all 50 states from a limited attack.</p>
        <p>''We believe, however, that it is essential to do this in a way that does not destroy the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty,'' Mr. Gore said. ''The A.B.M. Treaty is the cornerstone of strategic stability in our relationship with Russia.''</p>
        <p>What Mr. Bush proposed would almost surely entail violating the A.B.M. Treaty of 1972.</p>
        <p>The Texas governor proposed measures that would include building a defensive system that would cover all 50 states and could be extended to protect allies in Europe, the Middle East and Asia. In addition to holding out the possibility of large unilateral arms cuts, he said most American nuclear weapons should be removed from hair-trigger alert status.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said he wanted to reduce the size of the United States' nuclear arsenal to the ''lowest possible number consistent with our national security'' and below the levels called for under the Start II accord with Russia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also noted in his speech to the cadets that President Clinton was headed for Moscow next week. ''This is an historic meeting,'' he said. ''The president should leave with the full support of the American people,'' a subtle reminder to Republicans that partisan differences over national security traditionally stop at the water's edge when the president travels abroad.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's speech on military preparedness, delivered in Washington as he was flanked by foreign policy experts from four Republican administrations, earned the governor widespread news media coverage on a topic on which the Gore campaign has hoped Mr. Bush would appear inexperienced and politically vulnerable.</p>
        <p>Gore advisers have believed that the vice president's expertise in international affairs, and particularly arms control, would give him an edge in November.</p>
        <p>While Democrats had expected Mr. Bush to try to bolster his foreign policy credentials in the campaign, few expected the kind of speech that Mr. Bush delivered on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The speech was hailed by some foreign policy experts as a ''breakthrough'' in Republican thinking -- particularly the unilateral reduction of warheads -- and seemed to put arms control squarely on the debate agenda for the presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>The graduation ceremony at West Point, one of the most prestigious forums in the nation's military culture, offers an almost irresistible platform for anyone who wants to influence the national debate. But for just that reason, the military academy limits its speakers who are officeholders to the president, the vice president and the speaker of the House and bars political activities by them, according to Maj. James Whaley, a West Point spokesman.</p>
