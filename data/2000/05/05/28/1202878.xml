        <p>IT began on April 30 at Liar's Saloon, a Montauk tavern. That night, local residents say, some fishermen got into an argument with enforcement officials from the state's Department of Environmental Conservation, in town to attend a state-sponsored training course at the nearby Montauk Yacht Club.

        <p>And that, say Montauk fishermen, is when the real trouble began. Within days, fishermen charge, state police and conservation officials began deliberately harassing them. The fishermen claim the authorities unnecessarily boarded their boats and stopped their trucks, also giving them tickets for infractions that are normally not considered worthy of notice. Then, on Saturday, May 6, they raided Inlet Seafood, a commercial fishing dock where much of the local catch is brought. Inlet Seafood's general manager, Sima Freierman, said the police also stopped a truck bound for the Fulton Fish Market in Manhattan the following night. Held on a technicality -- failure to produce an inventory of the truck's cargo -- the truck never made it to Manhattan. Ms. Freierman said the fishermen lost thousands of dollars when their catch was sold on at the Fulton market on Tuesday morning, a day when competition from other wholesalers drove prices down.</p>

        <p>IT began on April 30 at Liar's Saloon, a Montauk tavern.

        <p>And that, say Montauk fishermen, is when the real trouble began. Within days, fishermen charge, state police and conservation officials began deliberately harassing them. The fishermen claim the authorities unnecessarily boarded their boats and stopped their trucks, also giving them tickets for infractions that are normally not considered worthy of notice. Then, on Saturday, May 6, they raided Inlet Seafood, a commercial fishing dock where much of the local catch is brought. Inlet Seafood's general manager, Sima Freierman, said the police also stopped a truck bound for the Fulton Fish Market in Manhattan the following night. Held on a technicality -- failure to produce an inventory of the truck's cargo -- the truck never made it to Manhattan. Ms. Freierman said the fishermen lost thousands of dollars when their catch was sold on at the Fulton market on Tuesday morning, a day when competition from other wholesalers drove prices down.</p>
        <p>On May 19, state policemen showed up in several Montauk restaurants and bars in the middle of the dinner hour, ostensibly looking for underage drinkers.</p>
        <p>This is not an activity the state troopers normally get involved in; typically enforcement of state liquor laws is done by State Liquor Authority agents, usually working undercover. But in the Montauk crackdown, the state police showed up in uniform, guns on hips.</p>
        <p>''It was about 9 o'clock,'' said Jimmy Hewitt, owner of the Shagwong Restaurant in Montauk Village. On a Friday night, the dining room and the bar were full. ''All of a sudden, about 12 state troopers in full uniform showed up,'' he said. ''A couple of them stayed outside by the back door, and one of them pushed in the bathroom door, as if he were looking for someone.'' The rest stood there, Mr. Hewitt said, while one demanded to see his liquor license.</p>
        <p>''I told him it was in the window, like it is supposed to be,'' Mr. Hewitt said.</p>
        <p>After questioning several bar patrons about their ages, the troopers left, Mr. Hewitt said. No underage drinkers were found, ''but a lot of my customers were very upset.''</p>
        <p>Other establishments in town received similar visits, including the Old Sheebeen and the Liar's Saloon, site of the initial disagreement between the police and local fishermen. At the West Cove Restaurant, the owner, Orla Troy, said that eight or nine troopers, all in uniform, came in through the side and front doors, demanding to see proof of age from patrons at the bar. One of them also demanded information about the tire slashings.</p>
        <p>''He made no bones about it,'' she said of the state trooper, whose name she says she did not get. ''He wanted information about what he called 'the incident,' and when I said I didn't have any, he said, 'We're going to keep this up until we find out who did it.' ''</p>
        <p>Employees at several of the targeted restaurants surmised that they were being singled out because Montauk is such a small community that the identity of the tire slasher or slashers had probably been spread by word of mouth. But if anyone has given information to the police, no charges have been filed.</p>
        <p>Repeated calls to the state Department of Environmental Conservation about recent events in Montauk were not returned. And though a state police spokeswoman in Albany, Tracy Snell, said that the May 19 sweep was merely part of an ongoing statewide program aimed at rooting out underage drinkers, the state police superintendent, James W. McMahon, was concerned enough about complaints about police behavior to dispatch an investigative team to Montauk last week, according to Col. Joseph Loszynski, the assistant deputy superintendent in charge of internal investigations. The investigators' report will be released as soon as possible, he said.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, residents remain skeptical about state police behavior.  But the incident is only the most recent eruption of longstanding tensions between law enforcement agencies and the local fishing community on the East End, where tourism and second-home ownership are booming, and where many of the old ways -- like fishing -- are in decline.</p>
        <p>There used to be lots of commercial fishing in East Hampton town, which stretches from Wainscott in the west to Montauk in the east. But many fisherman, including most of the baymen -- inshore fishermen, who fished in the waters of Peconic and Gardiners Bays from places like Three Mile Harbor -- have packed up their nets and left their marinas to the sailboats and motor yachts of the leisure class.</p>
        <p>Why? There are fewer fish in the sea for catching than once there were, thanks to factors as varied as pollution, the vagaries of nature, and what many say were years of overfishing. Regulations imposed by the state to preserve certain species for game fishing and to curtail further damage to the fisheries have limited catches enormously, so much so that many who fish complain that they can't make a living at all. Many East End commercial fishermen blame government, more than any other factor, for their woes.</p>
        <p>A kind of spiritual leader in this fight is Stuart B. Vorpahl. For generations, his family fished the bay, as did he. That is, until 1998, when he was arrested for fishing without a license. In fact, Mr. Vorpahl has never had a license, and has maintained for years that he does not need one. State fishing regulations are not only onerous, he contends, but invalid, too.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vorpahl, 60, claims that the Dongan Patent, issued in 1686 by Thomas Dongan, the colonial governor of New York, granted the inhabitants of East Hampton the right to hunt and fish within the town's borders subject only to the powers of a group of town trustees. The trustees, who administer East Hampton's beaches, are the only ones who can regulate fishing, says Mr. Vorpahl, who was once a trustee himself.</p>
        <p>But government officials see things quite differently. Twice, in 1991 and 1992, Mr. Vorpahl was cited for breaking state fishing laws, although both of those cases were later dropped by prosecutors. Then, in 1998, after hauling in another catch that exceeded state limits, he was charged again.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vorpahl moved to have the charge dismissed, but Justice Roger W. Walker of East Hampton Town Court denied his motion last year, finding the Dongan Patent insufficiently specific to be enforceable. Mr. Vorpahl appealed to the Appellate Term of the state Supreme Court. That court agreed with Justice Walker and ordered Mr. Vorpahl to stand trial, and Mr. Vorpahl did not appeal the case further.</p>
        <p>And so, on May 9, he had his trial. After a full day of testimony in the Town Justice Court, the jury returned a verdict finding him guilty of illegally taking fish but not of landing them. Logically, that was impossible; Justice Walker declared a mistrial.</p>
        <p>That means that Mr. Vorpahl will have to stand trial again, although he does not yet know when. He says that the wait ''is like a prison sentence.''</p>
        <p>''I can't go fishing until this is settled,'' he said. ''I'm not going to get a license, and if I fish without one, I know they'll arrest me.''</p>
        <p>And what does he think of the events out in Montauk?</p>
        <p>''It's really a pity what they are doing,'' Mr. Vorpahl said. ''They have created a real hatred for the police, and it may take generations to get over it.''</p>
        <p>Colonel Loszynski of the state police hopes that it won't take that long.  ''If our members didn't act appropriately,'' he said, ''we'll take the proper action immediately. We don't want the people out there disliking us.''</p>
