        <p>In ''The Silent Generation Seeks Its Due (May 7)'' Fred Brock looked at Americans who are too young to have fought in World War II but too old to be considered baby boomers.

        <p>As a member of the silent generation who was never silent or conformist, I think our lives span the fault line of major shifts and changes. As one peer said recently, my culture has grown away from my values.</p>

        <p>In ''The Silent Generation Seeks Its Due (May 7)'' Fred Brock looked at Americans who are too young to have fought in World War II but too old to be considered baby boomers. Members of that age group, in their mid-50's to early 70's, often feel overlooked by employers, marketers and the popular culture.</p>
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a member of the silent generation who was never silent or conformist, I think our lives span the fault line of major shifts and changes. As one peer said recently, my culture has grown away from my values.</p>
        <p>As children, many of us had dreams and aspirations circumscribed by poverty, wartime restrictions, then 50's myths of togetherness. (i.e. Rosie the Riveters putting down welding torches to don aprons). Women such as my circle of friends, who strove for education, careers and marriage, couldn't enter Ivy League colleges or aspire to corporate leadership.</p>
        <p>The ''silent'' ones, male and female, suddenly encountered bewildering shifts. Opportunities opened. I could become a corporate officer and serve on boards of directors. We who are neither angry nor have retreated from life can offer valued perspectives. Just the simple idea that there are long-term consequences, not just short-term me-centered decisions made on the fly for image or great wealth. The M.B.A. students I now teach appear to welcome alternate views and methods.</p>
        <p>Rather than just seeking their due, the misnamed silents can embrace leading, giving balanced perspectives and adapting what happened in the past to the present.</p>
