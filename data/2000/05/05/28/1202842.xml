        <p>To the Editor: ''What's Doing in Shanghai'' (April 16) reawakened memories, as my husband and I were there last October, just in time for the 50th anniversary celebration of the Communist takeover. We stayed at the Peace Hotel and ate in the Phoenix Restaurant. The delicious dinners were accompanied by a performance on traditional instruments by three fine musicians. We were seated at the window with an excellent view of the fireworks, which were spectacular. We were surprised, however, when many parents rushed over and placed their young children on our table so that they could see the display.</p>

        <p>Guests at the Peace Hotel might take advantage of the free half-hour tour of the hotel offered by the concierge or another manager. It is fascinating, with good views from the roof garden, suites furnished in the styles of seven countries and many restaurants and lounges.</p>
