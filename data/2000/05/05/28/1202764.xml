        <p>HEADLOCK</p>
        <p>By Adam Berlin.</p>
        <p>Algonquin, $21.95.</p>
        <p>Adam Berlin's first novel, ''Headlock,'' is a book with a split personality; it occupies fractured territory between family drama and noir. Narrated by a former college wrestler named Odessa Rose, the story unfolds over a single Christmas holiday, as Dess (as he is known) and his cousin Gary drive from New York to Las Vegas, where they must come up with $100,000 to cover Gary's gambling debts. Dess has been at loose ends since he was kicked off his school's wrestling team for brutally beating up an opponent; now he works as a garage attendant in Manhattan and provokes random bar fights. When he agrees to be Gary's enforcer, Dess hopes the trip west will offer him an opportunity to tame his demons once and for all. Where ''Headlock'' is at its best is in its evocation of the thoughts that flicker through Dess's and Gary's heads. Some of the book's most vivid moments come when the cousins discuss their dreams and disappointments, or talk about their grandfather, whom Dess admires because he never walked away from a fight. Once the pair reach Nevada, however, the novel begins to lose its focus. Part of the problem is that Berlin's take on Las Vegas is simplistic, filled with the usual assortment of hit men and blackjack dealers and Denny's waitresses with hearts of gold. Equally troublesome is Berlin's inability to sell us on Dess's desire for redemption, which in the end seems more like a plot device than anything in the character's heart.</p>
