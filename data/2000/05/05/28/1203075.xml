        <p>THE quaint little village of Antwerp, N.Y., seemed like an ideal place for Stephen and Vici Diehl to escape the noise and nuisance of city life and to indulge their passion for nature photography.</p>
        <p>What they found instead was a different type of noise and nuisance.</p>
        <p>Several years after settling into their four-bedroom 1827 Greek revival home on 1.5 acres 40 miles from the Canadian border, they said, their rural serenity was shattered by a neighbor playing amplified Christmas music on outdoor loudspeakers, blaring intermittently every day during the holidays.</p>
        <p>The neighbor is the First Congregational Church of Antwerp, with which the couple has been bickering in and out of courtrooms for six years. ''We just said, 'Please turn down the volume,' but they just didn't want anybody telling them what to do,'' said Mrs. Diehl, 49.</p>
        <p>Disputes between neighbors about loud noise, offensive odors, intrusive pets or wayward vegetation have been going on for centuries, and the exchanges can become rather unneighborly. The summer months, when people spend more time outdoors and new faces are most likely to move in to neighborhoods, are the peak season for disputes, legal experts say.</p>
        <p>When neighbor-to-neighbor arguments find their way to court, they are generally based on two kinds of claims. One is interference with what is called quiet enjoyment of one's property, a common-law right with ancient roots; the Diehls' dispute with the church is an example. The other common claim is of actual or potential reduction of property values.</p>
        <p>While having a good neighbor probably won't raise the value of a home, a bad one  certainly can lower it, said Cora Jordan, a Mississippi attorney and author of ''Neighbor Law: Fences, Trees, Boundaries and Noise'' (Nolo.com, 1999). She noted that a dilapidated house or grounds, a home-based business that draws traffic or makes noise, or drastic changes made to one property in a neighborhood can reduce what buyers are willing to pay for nearby homes. ''If your property value is affected, you can sue,'' Mrs. Jordan said.</p>
        <p>There are no reliable national figures on neighbor-to-neighbor legal disputes, but experts say the number is steadily growing, as homeowners become more aggressive in defense of quality of life and what is usually their largest investment by far, their homes. A hint can be gleaned from figures on civil disputes handled through state-sponsored mediation, a faster and cheaper alternative to a formal trial. Of the 40,860 cases of all kinds referred to New York's network of 62 mediation centers in fiscal 1999, a quarter were neighbor-related disputes; divorces and other domestic disputes, commercial disagreements and landlord-tenant quarrels make up much of the rest.</p>
        <p>When neighbors go to war, noise is the No. 1 casus belli everywhere. Among city apartment dwellers, parking and pets also rank high, according to Debra Shime, program director for a mediation center in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Suburban Hatfields and McCoys commonly feud over boundary encroachments (a new driveway or fence that creeps over the property line), trees and bushes (which might block a neighbor's view or sunlight) and eyesores.</p>
        <p>''We think we're so modern with our cell phones and gadgets, but people are having the same types of problems with their neighbors as they did 300 years ago,'' said Mark Warda, a Florida attorney and author of ''Neighbor vs. Neighbor'' (Sphinx Publishing, 1999). The book chronicles some bizarre quarrels, including a 1920's suit over a car horn that allegedly set off a chicken riot in which 720 birds perished. (The chicken farmer lost.)</p>
        <p>Neighbor-law experts say litigation ought to be the last resort. The first step should be calmly approaching neighbors about a problem, and if that fails, writing a letter. And Mrs. Jordan suggests researching local ordinances to see if a valid complaint exists before involving local authorities or suing.</p>
        <p>''The problem is, people don't always know their neighbors,'' Mr. Warda said, ''so they may feel uncomfortable. Years ago, you could go over to the neighbor and say, 'Hey Joe, could you please get your dog to stop barking while I take a nap?' ''</p>
        <p>The Diehls, who said the church's holiday music drove them indoors, kept them up nights and forced Mr. Diehl, 51, to take a leave from his position as a photography professor at Rochester Institute of Technology, tried to resolve the problem with the church directly before suing, but without success.</p>
        <p>The church's lawyer, Henry J. Leader, said the church tried turning the volume down and moving the loudspeakers, but nothing satisfied the Diehls. ''Nobody else complained,'' he said. ''There was even a petition by some of the other residents asking for the music to continue.''</p>
        <p>Finally the dispute came before a federal judge, who ordered the church to refrain from playing its amplified holiday music for two years, a ruling that expires this winter. Mr. Leader said that though the crux of the case was ''really freedom of speech,'' it is unlikely the music will resume.</p>
        <p>The limits to constitutional rights become an issue in cases like a recent one in Little Rock, Ark. Jennings Osborne, who owns the Arkansas Research Medical Testing Center, used to put up a dazzling display of three million Christmas lights on his main residence and two adjacent lots. Neighbors sued to make him tone down the display, arguing that traffic jams of onlookers from miles around prevented them from enjoying their own property during the holidays. He lost, and appealed on First Amendment and other grounds all the way to the Supreme Court, which declined to hear the case.</p>
        <p>But there is an epilogue: Walt Disney officials offered to buy Mr. Osborne's lights  -- all 350 miles of them, along with 32.2 miles of extension cords -- and they are now on display on the back lot at the MGM Studios theme park near Disney World in central Florida.</p>
        <p>When a dispute revolves around enforcement of local ordinances, codes and community rules, a third party such as a town board or homeowners' association often becomes involved, and winds up in court against one party or the other. An example is the long battle between Nelson Peltz, the chairman and chief executive of the Triarc Companies, and his neighbors in the wealthy Westchester town of Bedford over his commuting habits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peltz built a helipad on his 100-acre estate and began using it occasionally to travel between his home and his office 40 miles away in Manhattan. The noise of his helicopter irritated the actor E.G. Marshall and other neighbors, who complained to the town government that the flights violated zoning laws. The town sued Mr. Peltz successfully to keep him from using the pad. He switched to using an old airstrip elsewhere on the property, which he contends is legal because the strip predates the town zoning law. The town sued again, and the case is pending.</p>
        <p>Meantime, ''there are still complaints coming from neighbors about late-night helicopter landings that are preventing some people from sleeping,'' said Joel Sachs, the town's attorney. The aggrieved neighbors, he said, see ''no reason why he can't hop in his car and drive to the airport, five minutes away.''</p>
        <p>Meet at Fence Before Meeting in Court</p>
        <p>ANNOYED at the folks next door? Experts advise against going nuclear with a formal complaint or legal action right away; besides the cost, it can engender enmity that festers for years, no matter who wins.</p>
        <p>* Start by having an informal chat with the neighbor, a chat that avoids placing blame and focuses on finding a solution.</p>
        <p>* If the chat fails, try a letter. Again, for best results, keep the language calm.</p>
        <p>* Research applicable local laws and document the problem -- and anything you have done to try to solve it -- before taking the matter to local officials.</p>
        <p>* In many communities, a mediation center can help settle disputes before or after a suit is filed, often without charge.</p>
