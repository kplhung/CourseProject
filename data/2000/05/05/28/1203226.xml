        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your article about sleeping sickness (front page, May 21) illustrates not the ''disconnection between the world's pharmaceutical giants and the fatal or debilitating diseases of the third world's poor,'' but a more basic disconnect between the world's haves and have-nots. Yet enhanced access to medicines cannot be accomplished by diluting intellectual property protection, a simplistic solution some advocate for AIDS drugs.</p>
        <p>Sleeping sickness drugs are off-patent. The problem is the World Health Organization's inability to find a suitable manufacturer.</p>

        <p>Your article about sleeping sickness (front page, May 21) illustrates not the ''disconnection between the world's pharmaceutical giants and the fatal or debilitating diseases of the third world's poor,'' but a more basic disconnect between the world's haves and have-nots. Yet enhanced access to medicines cannot be accomplished by diluting intellectual property protection, a simplistic solution some advocate for AIDS drugs.</p>
        <p>Sleeping sickness drugs are off-patent. The problem is the World Health Organization's inability to find a suitable manufacturer.</p>
        <p>Governments and international organizations need to work together to help eradicate disease and build modern health care infrastructures in the developing world. Pharmaceutical companies are doing more than their share. Company-sponsored programs are helping to fight AIDS, river blindness and other diseases in poor countries. These efforts, though significant, cannot stand alone. A major effort by the international community is needed, but local governments must take primary responsibility.</p>
