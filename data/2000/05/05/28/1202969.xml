        <p>ONE way to refinish a kitchen countertop where the plastic laminate is worn is to resurface it with ceramic tile.</p>
        <p>First, check the condition of the laminate carefully. The surface must be flat, relatively smooth and firmly bonded to the counter. Once you have determined that the laminate bond is secure, you can pick out the tiles you want for the counter. Avoid choosing unglazed, porous tiles or tiles with a high-gloss glaze. Unglazed tiles stain easily and will be hard to maintain. High-gloss tiles will scratch.</p>

        <p>ONE way to refinish a kitchen countertop where the plastic laminate is worn is to resurface it with ceramic tile.</p>
        <p>First, check the condition of the laminate carefully. The surface must be flat, relatively smooth and firmly bonded to the counter. Once you have determined that the laminate bond is secure, you can pick out the tiles you want for the counter. Avoid choosing unglazed, porous tiles or tiles with a high-gloss glaze. Unglazed tiles stain easily and will be hard to maintain. High-gloss tiles will scratch.</p>
        <p>Ceramic tiles are available in a wide range of sizes and colors. Most do-it-yourselfers will find that the standard four-and-a-quarter-inch square ceramic tiles are easiest to work with because they are a convenient size and they have spacing tabs to ensure uniform grout joints. To determine how many tiles you need, calculate the area of the counter top, including the backsplash, and add 15 percent to cover cutting mistakes, breakage and spares for future repairs.</p>
        <p>You will also need a latex or acrylic thin-set adhesive to bond the tiles to the counter, and an unsanded grout to fill the gaps between the tiles. Consult the specifications on the packages to determine the required amounts for each, or check with the dealer at the tile store.</p>
        <p>It is likely that you will have to cut some tiles and shape others to fit around the sink opening. You will need a tile cutter and a nibbler for these tasks. These can be rented from the tile dealer or from a tool rental store. You will also need a notched trowel and a grout float.</p>
        <p>Start by removing the sink and fixtures. First, shut off the water supply to the faucets. Then disconnect the supply lines and remove the fixtures. Loosen the sink tailpiece and the retaining clips under the sink, then lift the sink from the counter.</p>
        <p>Wash the counter top with a mild detergent to remove all dirt and grease, then sand the surface with 120-grit sandpaper. The sanding will roughen the laminate surface and create a ''tooth'' for the tile adhesive to bond with. Use a damp cloth to clean all dust from the surface.</p>
        <p>The hardest part of any tile installation is planning the layout so the tiles will look symmetrical. Since the sink is the focal point of the counter top, the layout should be centered on it. Lay a row of tiles along the front edge of the sinkhole, making sure the row is centered on the sinkhole.</p>
        <p>Use a pencil to place a mark on the counter at one end of the row. This will be the starting point for the layout. Use a framing square to extend the mark to the backsplash. Lay a row of tiles along this new line, then repeat this operation on the other side of the sinkhole.</p>
        <p>Next lay a row of tiles around the perimeter of the sink. If they extend over the sinkhole, mark the overlapping material on the underside of each tile, then cut them to fit the opening. Use the tile cutter to cut straight pieces and the nibbler to break away small portions to fit the corners. You may also have to cut the tiles that fit against the backsplash.</p>
        <p>When all the tiles are cut to size, you can begin the installation. First, nail a temporary wooden straightedge, called a batten, to the edge of the counter. This will serve as a guide for aligning the first row of tiles. Mix the adhesive according to the package directions, then let the mixture stand for about 15 minutes to develop stronger bonding power.</p>
        <p>Spread the adhesive with the flat side of the trowel, then flip the trowel over and use the notched side to comb the adhesive in a uniformly rigid pattern. Begin setting the tiles at the front edge, starting at your pencil mark; then continue to tile the entire counter. When you place the tiles along the backsplash, be sure to align them with the rest of the counter tiles. After all the tiles are in, place a piece of plywood (about 12 inches by 12 inches) on top of the tiles and tap the board with a rubber mallet. This will seat the tiles firmly in the adhesive.</p>
        <p>Allow at least 24 hours for the adhesive to set before applying the grout. Mix the grout according to the package directions and spread it across the face of the tiles with the grout float. Hold the float at a shallow angle to force the grout into the gaps between the tiles. Let the grout set for about 15 minutes, then wipe away any residue with a damp cloth. When the grout has had time to dry completely, apply a grout sealer with a small artist's brush.</p>
