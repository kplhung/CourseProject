        <p>Of 13 counties in New Jersey monitored for ozone levels in the air from 1996 through 1998 by the federal Environmental Protection Agency all except Bergen received a failing grade, and Bergen barely passed with a D, according to a survey of ozone levels made public last week by the American Lung Association. Camden County and Ocean County were rated worst among the counties where ozone monitoring devices are located in New Jersey; Camden ranked 21st out of the 25 worst counties in the country. Ground-level ozone is created when nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons such as unburned gasoline and diesel fuel react with the heat from sunlight.</p>
