        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Expectations, Over the Rainbow'' (May 7), in which Mark Hulbert made the mathematical calculation that for Cisco stock to be reasonably priced now the company would have to have an annualized earnings growth rate of 60 percent and since that is very unlikely, it is highly likely that Cisco is markedly overvalued.</p>
        <p>Certainly by any previous standard, Cisco's price is highly overvalued. But if you look back to 1991, using Mr. Hulbert's model, you would not have bought Cisco, either, because you could not have predicted that its revenue would grow at an average annual rate of 83 percent in the next 5 years, or that its earnings would grow at an annualized rate of 96 percent.</p>
        <p>My argument is not to say the math is wrong, but that it is obviously inappropriate to use Mr. Hulbert's model to predict the performance of a growth stock.</p>
