        <p>DO you like those arms?'' Tyce Keith D'Orio demanded of the student dancers trying to follow his moves at Horizons Dance Center in the Flatlands section of Brooklyn. ''I don't like those arms. They need to pop.''</p>
        <p>The students tried again. About two dozen, teenagers and young adults, were jammed into the small studio, moving to the strains of Tracy Bonham's alternative rock song ''Navy Bean'' at top volume.

        <p>DO you like those arms?'' Tyce Keith D'Orio demanded of the student dancers trying to follow his moves at Horizons Dance Center in the Flatlands section of Brooklyn. ''I don't like those arms. They need to pop.''</p>
        <p>The students tried again. About two dozen, teenagers and young adults, were jammed into the small studio, moving to the strains of Tracy Bonham's alternative rock song ''Navy Bean'' at top volume. Mr. D'Orio, a former principal dancer in the Broadway show ''Fosse,'' had choreographed the hard-driving number, but he was not satisfied.</p>
        <p>''I'm still getting Lyrical, 4:30 to 6,'' he said, alluding to the school's course in showbiz-accented ballet.</p>
        <p>Mr. D'Orio, 29, knows the turf well: he began his own dance training at the school at 10. Now a professional performer in Los Angeles -- he was one of Paula Abdul's lead dancers and has performed with Janet Jackson, Ricky Martin and Jennifer Lopez -- he occasionally teaches at the school and stays in touch with its teachers.</p>
        <p>The storefront school, which is on Avenue N near East 48th Street and is one of two Horizons branches with a combined enrollment of 1,000, is one of scores of such businesses throughout the city. (America Online's yellow pages list 96 schools in the city outside Manhattan.)</p>
        <p>With names like Mrs. Rosemary's and Starlet Studio, they suggest small-town innocence only 45 minutes from Broadway. As with Horizons, which had its end-of-year recital last weekend, the typical student is a small girl smitten with pink leotards who dabbles in dance after school. But many studios also have a corps of serious students, who study intensively and win competitions. Some have professional careers.</p>
        <p>For these students, studios like Horizons are the necessary first step toward the stage. At their best, these small schools produce some successful dancers by harnessing the energy of urban youth who have little income but plenty of talent and enthusiasm. At their worst, they capitalize on the dreams of many who will never go far.</p>
        <p>Andrew Turteltaub, who graduated from Horizons four years ago, met dancers from all over the country last year when he performed in ''The Radio City Christmas Spectacular.'' ''I think everyone came from a hometown studio, then traveled to New York,'' said the young dancer, who feels he made the same kind of journey, albeit by subway: he grew up in Canarsie, Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Before setting sights on Lincoln Center, students at these schools often dream of trophies at local competitions, like the Miss and Mister Dance of New York contest, sponsored by the local Dancemasters of America, a dance education group. The most recent Mister Dance of New York competition was won by Ricky Colon, a Horizons student from Brighton Beach.</p>
        <p>Students like Mr. Colon, 17, are the lifeblood of many of these schools, which tend to be operated by former dancers. Such potential stars are essential to the vision of Linda Abbate-Machado, who founded Horizons 27 years ago, even though they account for only a small fraction of her business, which she thinks may be the largest in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Most revenues, she said, come from what she called her ''recreational'' customers, the toddlers in movement classes and others seeking to stay in shape.</p>
        <p>''I can hire a teacher for $20 an hour to teach 20 babies,'' Ms. Abbate-Machado said. ''That supports my habit.'' She pointed to a small group of dancers she had plucked from large classes and invited to study more frequently.</p>
        <p>But her clientele is not wealthy. ''People go without cable to pay for this,'' she said. So she cannot charge high tuition. Monthly fees range from $42 for weekly classes to $130 for unlimited use of the studio.</p>
        <p>''Is this cost-effective?'' Ms. Abbate-Machado asked recently as she rehearsed a few Miss Dance hopefuls. ''It can't be.''</p>
        <p>But promising students in New York need to aim for competitions, she said, because ''kids here don't have a chance to perform the way they might in a small town.''</p>
        <p>''Here,'' she added, ''even the showcases can get professionals.''</p>
        <p>Still, Ms. Abbate-Machado said, her school avoids the ''cheesy competitions.'' Defining cheesy competition is controversial in dance education.</p>
        <p>''Competitions are a necessary evil,'' said Vickie Sheer, executive director of Dance Educators of America in Pelham, N.Y., whose 2,000-member group holds some contests of its own, combining them with classes for instructors and students. But increasingly, she said, professional promoters dominate the field, charging high entry fees for contests of dubious educational value, where smiles count more than technique.</p>
        <p>In Port Richmond, Staten Island, Lydia's School of Dance used to send students to six competitions a year. One group won a chance to perform at Dollywood, the Tennessee theme park partly owned by Dolly Parton. Now its focus is on modern dance, the specialty of the owner, Lydia Bellach-Ruocco, and a departure from the usual jazz-tap-ballet menu offered at most small schools. When Lydia's School of Dance opened 11 years ago, only one student enrolled in modern dance. Now more than 50 of the 300 students pursue that discipline.</p>
        <p>Lydia's School of Dance now enters only one competition annually, although some of the students perform at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center.</p>
        <p>Yet competitions can help begin a career. Long before landing a part in ''Fosse,'' Mr. D'Orio was Mr. Dance of New York and then Mr. Dance of America 1989. Both competitions are organized and judged by working professionals. ''It's such a small world,'' he said. ''You end up running into those people at auditions.''</p>
        <p>Contests are part of the incubation process for dancers, which, in recent years, has become more expensive. When rents in the city rose sharply in the 1980's, schools forced into smaller quarters had to trim classes. The consequent decline in tuition put many schools out of business, and most surviving studios have shrunk.</p>
        <p>''Now there are all these little schools with one teacher, and one teacher can only bring a student to a certain point,'' said Ms. Abbate-Machado, whose Horizons school is now half the size it was in the 1980's. In addition to the studio on Avenue N, which she owns with Rachel Bascietto, Ms. Abbate-Machado has a school on Avenue U in Gravesend, rented for $1,500 a month. She retreated there three years ago from a larger space on Avenue X, where the rent had jumped to $4,800. Between that and liability insurance, she said, ''I had to teach too many students to meet the bills.''</p>
        <p>She declined to give specifics, but Ms. Abbate-Machado said her school, which has five full-time staff members, five part-timers and a dozen guest teachers and assistants, had produced ''a very nice business.''</p>
        <p>And more than one grateful student. Mr. D'Orio said he owed much of his success to Horizons. Ms. Abbate-Machado and Ms. Bascietto, he said, ''understand, when a new student comes in, how to introduce dance to them so they know what they're doing.''</p>
        <p>And, he added, ''those kids have a certain kind of spark.''</p>
