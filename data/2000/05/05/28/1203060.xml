        <p>It is a simple wooden crate, with an Indian River Citrus label and, in the artist's handwriting, the words ''Magic Box'' on a piece of masking tape. Inside are plastic insects, blue skulls and a toy snowman, images that appeared frequently in the work of David Wojnarowicz, a downtown artist whose writings and photographs rebelled against bigotry and the status quo.</p>
        <p>For Marvin Taylor, director of the Fales Library at New York University, the box is a treasure chest, the palette of an artist he holds in the highest regard. ''It's a box of David's metaphors,'' he said. ''It's the most amazing thing I've ever seen.''</p>
        <p>Most other archivists would not keep such daily-life items, known as realia, but Mr. Taylor believes that the school's downtown collection of underground literature, avant-garde art and innovative performances from the 1970's and 80's should be different.</p>
        <p>''Not to keep this would be not to know David,'' he said of Mr. Wojnarowicz, who died of AIDS at 37.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor, 38, who grew up a fan of punk culture, in Cottage Grove, Ind., population 109, started the collection five years ago out of a desire to preserve the downtown arts world in its own backyard. It includes the work of artists like Dennis Cooper, Keith Haring, Laurie Anderson, Karen Finley and Yoko Ono.</p>
        <p>''We should be the archive that does this scene,'' said Mr. Taylor. ''It's a neighborhood culture. And what a neighborhood to have!'' He described how in the 1850's, the university rented out rooms to Bohemians (true Bohemians, from Bohemia), which helped make Greenwich Village the psychological center of the avant-garde.</p>
        <p>The collection includes 8,000 volumes representing the work of several hundred artists, plus 300 periodicals, film, fine art, and six boxes of Wojnarowicz's journals, including one from his summer vacation with Outward Bound in 1971, when he was 16. ''He'd be writing and suddenly, if it wasn't working, he'd just start drawing, not even lift the pen,'' Mr. Taylor said.</p>
        <p>As of April the collection includes the archive of the Judson Memorial Church, often considered the birthplace of postmodern dance.</p>
        <p>''They would open the church so that people who couldn't afford halls would come in and do their work,'' Mr. Taylor said, showing a photo of one performance that featured  dancers on rooftops of Lower Manhattan. ''It is ground zero, and what we're trying to present.''</p>
        <p>The Downtown Collection is open to researchers Monday through Thursday from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. and Fridays by appointment.</p>
        <p>The collection is indebted to Ron Kolm, a bookstore manager in Long Island City who turned his two-bedroom apartment into a repository of manuscripts, letters, fliers, clippings and programs about downtown art events and sold his archive to New York University.</p>
        <p>''He and his wife and two children were sleeping in one of the bedrooms, and he was desperately worried there would be a fire, and the history of the downtown scene would've disappeared,'' Mr. Taylor said.</p>
