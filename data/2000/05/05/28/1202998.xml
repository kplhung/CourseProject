        <p>Brace yourself, New Brunswick: ''the funniest man on television,'' ''the world's most celebrated choir,'' ''the Baryshnikov of Irish dance'' and ''the world's favorite turtle'' all plan to be visiting soon.</p>
        <p>Those, at least, are among the descriptions in the State Theater's publicity for its coming season, which begins Oct. 6 with a performance by the Baryshnikovian Celticfusion, an Irish dance ensemble. The turtle will be close behind, in an Oct. 15 children's show called ''Franklin's Big Adventure.'' The television funny man is Mark Russell, whose political comedy hits town on Oct. 28, and the choir is the Vienna Choir Boys, arriving on Dec. 15.</p>
        <p>The vast and varied lineup includes veteran pop acts like Kenny Rogers, Neil Sedaka, Ray Charles, Paul Anka and Peter, Paul and Mary. A few steps up the cultural ladder are the Bolshoi Symphony Orchestra and the Moscow Festival Ballet, and a few steps down, perhaps, are the comedian Paula Poundstone and the loopy magic of Penn and Teller.</p>

        <p>In addition to Franklin, family fare includes ''Peter Pan'' in October, ''Cinderella'' in December and ''Come Back, Amelia Bedelia'' in February. A generous helping of ballet and opera is offered, along with a smattering of adventurous acts like the Kodo Drummers of Japan, the Ukrainian National Song and Dance Company and Les Tambours du Bronx, percussionists from France.</p>
        <p>A brochure on the season is available by calling the theater at (732) 246-7469 or (877) 782-8311.</p>
