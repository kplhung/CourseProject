        <p>As the clock neared zero yesterday and an odd Indiana Pacers' comeback began to materialize, Game 3 started to take on the feel of a Reggie Miller moment.</p>
        <p>More than a few fans at Madison Square Garden had to remember his game-winning 8-point binge in the final 16 seconds of a 1995 playoff game here. Or maybe the thought of his 25-point fourth quarter in a 1994 playoff game at the Garden crossed the minds of some.</p>

        <p>As the clock neared zero yesterday and an odd Indiana Pacers' comeback began to materialize, Game 3 started to take on the feel of a Reggie Miller moment.</p>
        <p>More than a few fans at Madison Square Garden had to remember his game-winning 8-point binge in the final 16 seconds of a 1995 playoff game here. Or maybe the thought of his 25-point fourth quarter in a 1994 playoff game at the Garden crossed the minds of some.</p>
        <p>Surely, it seemed, Pacers Coach Larry Bird would go to Miller once Indiana pulled to 6 points with 19 seconds remaining. Surely, he would see if one more Garden miracle resided in the stroke of one of the greatest clutch shooters of all time.</p>
        <p>But Bird left Miller where he had been since the 1-minute-49-second mark of the fourth quarter: on the bench. Of course, it is probable that inserting Miller would not have made a difference. But Bird did not even give it a chance.</p>
        <p>''We had Jalen,'' Bird said of Jalen Rose, who scored 22 of his 26 points in the fourth quarter. ''Reggie was letting Jalen score. We got a lot of points just letting him go in there and we knew they were going to play Reggie tough, and we figured we'd get us an opportunity. But we really didn't. It didn't come down to whether Reggie Miller was in the game at the end.''</p>
        <p>At the end, it was 98-95, New York. The Pacers tried to foul after Austin Croshere hit a 3-pointer with 4.7 seconds left to cut the Knicks' lead to 3 points, but they could not get the officials to blow the whistle. So Miller exited the Garden floor in his warm-ups, without having received a last chance to stick it to the fans he hates most.</p>
        <p>''It's a coach's call,'' Miller said of being kept on the bench down the stretch. ''I am not going to check myself in.''</p>
        <p>It had been a sporadic afternoon for Miller, who scored 19 points for the third straight game. After stepping back to let Rik Smits enjoy his groove and score 21 points in the first half, Miller hit two 3-pointers and scored 12 points in the third quarter. But just when he seemed to have it flowing, he let his temper get the best of him. After being called for a foul on Latrell Sprewell with 6:07 left in the third, Miller began jawing at the referees.</p>
        <p>''I thought the tide really turned on that call,'' Miller said. ''I thought we had gained control of the game right there, and he hit both free throws. They go up by 3, and that was just somewhat of a tide turn right there.''</p>
        <p>Miller, who often thrives in such situations, answered quickly with a 22-footer that pulled the Pacers to 55-54. But rather than misdirect his anger at the crowd, or at the Knicks, he gestured contemptuously to the officials and was called for a technical foul.</p>
        <p>The crowd reacted loudly, and Houston sank the free throw that effectively silenced Miller and the Pacers. Houston's foul shot put the Knicks up by 2 points with 5 minutes 45 seconds left. By the final minute of the third quarter, the Knicks were ahead by 9 points, 71-62.</p>
        <p>Bird did not care for Miller's back-and-forth with the officials and sat him out for the first five minutes of the fourth quarter. He reinserted Miller only to watch him miss two shots and continue jabbering at the referees. Believing that Miller had been thrown off his game, Bird took him out for good with the Pacers trailing by 11 points.</p>
        <p>''He just got frustrated down at the end and he continued to talk to the officials,'' Bird said. ''I thought we better get him out of there at that time.''</p>
        <p>Miller, who scored just 6 points after receiving his technical midway through the third, said talking with referees never bothers his play.</p>
        <p>''You've got to have some type of banter with the officials, whether it be good or bad,'' Miller said. ''I was just letting them know that they see it one way, but I see it another way.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Bird saw it another way as well.</p>
