        <p>As millions of Americans travel this Memorial Day weekend they are joined by family, friends and what has become for many an indispensable companion on a car trip, the cellular phone.</p>
        <p>Tens of thousands of other drivers will also be on the highways equipped with wireless and Internet hookups in vehicles that can deliver faxes to the driver's seat, provide maps to neighborhood streets or faraway destinations, or route hungry travelers to a good restaurant.</p>
        <p>The information highway is merging with the nation's highways at breakneck speed, and safety experts fear that with so many distractions -- even television -- the devices may lead to more traffic accidents.</p>
        <p>Some law enforcement officials say cell phones have become the most common distraction on the highway, and some have begun to note an increase in accidents caused by drivers using cell phones.</p>
        <p>But safety researchers say no reliable data exists that shows cell phone usage by motorists to be any more distracting than tuning car radios or drinking coffee while driving.</p>
        <p>In any event, the proliferation of cell phone use by drivers has raised the concerns of public safety officials and the telecommunications industry. A few communities, but no states, have banned the use of hand-held phones while driving.</p>
        <p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, in a report two years ago, recommended more research about cell phones in cars, more education of drivers about their use and tracking by the police when phones are thought to be involved in accidents.</p>
        <p>Law enforcement officers say their experience tells them that drivers are violating common sense.</p>
        <p>''Most of the communications found in the office and home are becoming commonplace in cars and trucks and there's no question they can be very distracting,'' said Col. Charles C. Hall, director of the Florida Highway Patrol. ''Put a telephone in the hand of a very aggressive driver and you have a greater problem.''</p>
        <p>The industry estimates that Americans now own more than 92 million cell phones, up from 69 million in 1998 and about 6 million 10 years ago. Surveys show that four out of five cell phone owners will place or receive calls while driving. One out of four, however, phone frequently.</p>
        <p>Cell phones in use are expected to more than quadruple in the United States to about 235 million by 2005. Moreover, auto manufacturers are preparing to provide millions of new cars with voice-activated high-tech devices for communications and devices that will compete for driver attention.</p>
        <p>''What we see now is just the front end of a major booming issue for highway safety,'' said Chuck Hurley, executive director for highway safety of the National Safety Council.</p>
        <p>''It's not just cell phones coming at us but an entire range of wireless equipment being installed in cars,'' Mr. Hurley said.</p>
        <p>He said the Air Force long ago recognized that placing too many tasks in a plane's cockpit interfered with a pilot's ability to fly a plane, and the same principle might be applied to what is going on in cars.</p>
        <p>''What the wireless industry and state governments need to do is to constantly reach out to consumers and tell them that when they get behind the wheel of a car they must drive responsibly,'' said Tom Wheeler, president of the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association, a trade organization in Washington representing about 400 manufacturers and providers of wireless equipment.</p>
        <p>''One of my pet peeves is when individuals apply for a driver's license they have to know how many feet they have to park away from a driveway but absolutely nothing about the safe use of a phone while driving,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wheeler said state governments have rightly rejected legislation to restrict the use of hand-held phones by drivers.</p>
        <p>''We don't need more laws,'' he said. ''But we do need a lot more in the way of public education.''</p>
        <p>Bills have been prepared in more than 20 states, including New York, to limit cell phone use on the roads but all have failed.</p>
        <p>But similar measures keep popping up in pockets of local government. Hilltown Township, Pa., a suburb north of Philadelphia, is one of only a handful of communities that have laws controlling phone calls from a car. Louis A. Mosiello, a Westchester County, N.Y., legislator from Yonkers, is pressing for an ordinance in the county to ban hand-held phones while driving.</p>
