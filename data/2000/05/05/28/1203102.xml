        <p>EVERYONE knows America is a nation in a hurry -- especially the makers of packaged foods. First there was the TV dinner. Then came fast food for meals on the go. Now, with the pace of life approaching warp speed, it's time for something marketers call hyperconvenience food, portable comfort cuisine and dashboard dining.</p>
        <p>In their continuing quest to trim the amount of time spent on cooking and eating, packaged-food producers are streamlining every aspect of dining -- shopping, preparation, the act itself and cleanup. Supermarkets are clustering meal components near each other to reduce the time spent wandering the aisles. Short-cuts like pre-washed, peeled vegetables are everywhere. Products like yogurt that can be squeezed from a tube, snack bars that theoretically nourish as completely as regular meals and scrambled eggs in push-up containers are proliferating. And any food that can be shaped to fit into automobile cup holders is considered to have a great advantage.</p>
        <p>Whether fueled by time-pressed parents or unraveling family life, ''convenience continues to dominate the food scene,'' said John L. Stanton, a professor of food marketing at St. Joseph's University in Philadelphia. ''People want to eat the right things but when it comes to trading health for time, time wins.''</p>
        <p>At Pepsico, executives refer to hyperconvenience as a marketing concept. ''It's accentuating the immediacy or the urgency of the consumer,'' a company spokesman said. ''It is convenience to the nth degree.''</p>
        <p>One source of inspiration is the military, which knows a thing or two about feeding people on the march. Heater Meals of Cincinnati has begun repackaging products for the general public that it has long sold as army rations. Using technology tested over and over in battle, the company offers meals like lasagna and flame-broiled turkey in styrofoam containers that heat up when the diner sets off a chemical reaction between a jigger of salt water and a slab of iron and magnesium. The food is piping hot within 14 minutes, the company says.</p>
        <p>''We've got all kinds of markets, like truck drivers, the National Guard and campers,'' said Derrick Wills, a marketing assistant for Heater Meals. ''Natural disasters, too, when you need a meal and don't have the resources to cook.'' Can overstressed families be far behind?</p>
        <p>OTHER marketers are eager to push convenience dining in new directions. Witness the new McSalad Shaker from McDonald's. No need to toss the salad with a couple of retro serving spoons: just pour the dressing over the salad in a plastic soda cup, cover the cup with a rounded plastic top and shake the ensemble to distribute the ingredients evenly. The container fits neatly into a car cup holder, though people are expected to eat the salad with a fork.</p>
        <p>Breakaway Foods of Bluebell, Pa., has shoehorned that old standby, macaroni and cheese, into a microwaveable cardboard tube with a push-up stick. The product, IncrEdibles, is hitting supermarkets this summer.</p>
        <p>Not wanting to be left behind, Frito-Lay has come up with Frito corn chips in the same package with a portion of chili. ''With snacking being a fourth meal, people are looking for fast fuel,'' said Lynn Markley, a Frito-Lay spokeswoman. ''These kits are the ideal fuel for Americans on the go.''</p>
        <p>A similar line has been developed by the 7-Eleven convenience store chain, which calls it ''dashboard dining.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the move toward utensil-less meals was inevitable, even as it blurs the line between humans and animals. ''During the last five years, there's been a real acceleration of food that is designed to be eaten directly from the package,'' said Thomas Hine, the author of ''The Total Package'' (Little, Brown, 1995), a study of packaging trends and their impact on consumers. ''This is to add an extra level of convenience that can be charged for. It's a way of ratcheting up the profit margin.''</p>
        <p>In researching his book, Mr. Hine interviewed marketing consultants who commissioned teenagers to photograph their families. The consultants found that people were frequently eating directly out of boxes, bags or other containers. ''They discovered that an extremely high percentage of food is eaten right out of the package, whether the package was designed for that or not,'' Mr. Hine said.</p>
        <p>In addition, teenagers and other family members -- whether because of schedules or dysfunction -- were shown eating meals at different times, rather than sitting down to dinner together. In Mr. Hine's latest book, ''The Rise and Fall of the American Teen-Ager'' (Avon), he concludes that the scattershot approach to the family dinner hour is linked to social problems like drug use.</p>
        <p>Still, such findings are music to the ears of food marketers. Robert Berman, the founder of Breakaway Foods, said his eureka moment came while watching his 14-year-old daughter play with her food. ''We were having dinner in an Italian restaurant, and she had finished eating four or five bites of her spaghetti when she started twirling it around her fork and holding it up in the air,'' he recalled. ''Then she started twirling it around a bread stick and held it up. I started wondering if there was ever a portable pasta. I did some research, and found that there hadn't been one in 3,000 years.''</p>
        <p>Thus began the IncrEdibles line, which now includes scrambled eggs (with or without sausage and bacon), as well as chili and a healthier-sounding entry with broccoli mixed in with macaroni and cheese.</p>
        <p>''People are constantly pressed for time and on the move,'' Mr. Berman said. ''When I was growing up in the 50's and 60's, my mom made breakfast every day and the family sat down for dinner every night. It's a very different pace we live today. Breakfast is pretty much gone, as far as sitting down and eating. Lunch is on the way out, and dinner is under attack.''</p>
