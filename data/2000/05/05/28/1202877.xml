        <p>THE East Northport eighth graders invited to preview the American Airpower Museum at Republic Field had all witnessed war before. Some had seen the movie ''Battlefield Earth.'' Others remember the Persian Gulf war from television. But most, like 13-year-old Hassan Nagvi, get their notions from video games.</p>
        <p>''This is like seeing the real things behind the games I play,'' Hassan said as he crawled through the drab, cramped interior of a B-17 Flying Fortress.</p>
        <p>As Maurice Berger, a museum volunteer, guided the students through the collection of vintage military hardware, the visitors seemed impressed. But not as dazzled as when Sergeant Berger, a former B-17 gunner from Queens and now a member of the 533rd Living History Squadron, showed them the shrapnel that was pried out of his back after one mission in 1994. They winced as they leaned forward to see the fragment. That is the type of living history the museum offers.</p>
        <p>The museum, which opened last week, has the East Coast's biggest collection of World War II-era military aircraft in flying condition. In addition to the Boeing B-17, there is a Grumman Avenger of the kind made next door at Bethpage, a North American B-25 Mitchell bomber, a Vought F-4U Corsair, a Curtiss P-40 Warhawk and a North American T-6 Texan. But the crown jewel is the latest acquisition: a Republic P-47 Thunderbolt, an illustrious fighter plane returning to the place it was built.</p>
        <p>The museum is the brainchild of Jeff Clyman, 54, an aircraft enthusiast and C.E.O. of Avirex, a New York City clothing manufacturer. After working on the concept for three years, he received a $250,000 grant from the state. With volunteer help from local trade unions and the assistance of the Long Island Jet Center, which owns part of Republic Field and leased two hangars to the museum, Mr. Clyman's dream is now a reality.</p>
        <p>The museum will depend on admissions, corporate sponsorship of flights of the vintage planes, corporate grants and rents paid by movie and television companies for the vintage planes.</p>
        <p>There are other flying museums of World War II-era aircraft. The Confederate Air Force in Midland, Tex., is the largest, and other collections exist in Chino, Calif.; Kissimmee, Fla., and Elmira, N.Y. But none has the connection to the past provided by Republic Field.</p>
        <p>The P-47 was purchased recently from a California collector. Although no price was disclosed, a museum spokesman said this P-47 is one of only six that can still fly.</p>
        <p>One Long Islander particularly pleased to welcome it was Francis Gabreski of Dix Hills, the nation's highest-ranking living flying ace. The retired colonel shot down 28 German planes in a P-47, and added six and a half kills in the Korean War.</p>
        <p>''Aviation has been a part of Long Island from the beginning, and having that great workhorse, the P-47, return here is very important,'' the colonel said. ''It is a wonderful and very important thing, showing history like this, flyable airplanes, exposing World War II to the public. It was the greatest war ever won by Americans, in my book.</p>
        <p>''We need to perpetuate this history for the future. People in my age bracket aren't going to be around much longer, so people who come to this museum can have the benefit of hearing from living historians.''</p>
        <p>One of them is Josephine Rachiele, 76, of West Babylon. In 1943, at age 20, she came to Republic for a mailroom job. ''I wanted to do something for my country,'' she said.</p>
        <p>She ended up getting a job as a riveter. ''I used to sew, but I didn't know anything about riveting,'' she said. ''My first day I was so shook up.'' She built P-47's for 60 cents an hour, six days a week. She worked at Republic, in the hangar just north of where the museum has been set up, until the end of the war, then gave up her job to a returning veteran.</p>
        <p>But 18 months later she returned, working at Republic (later Fairchild Republic) until it closed in 1986, building successive generations of planes -- F-84 Thunderjets of the early cold war, F-105 Thunderchiefs of the Vietnam era and A-10 Thunderbolts, the Warthogs of Persian Gulf War fame.</p>
        <p>''The P-47's are my favorite,'' she said. Nine thousand of the 15,683 P-47's were built in Farmingdale. ''I'm very excited seeing these planes again,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Women like Ms. Rachiele are important to remember, said Julia Lauria-Blum, 40, a guide from Farmingdale who specializes in the women who were military workers, especially the Women's Air Service Pilots, or Wasps. ''There were 18 Wasps who flew the P-47's from Long Island to New Jersey, where they were sent off to battle,'' Ms. Lauria-Blum said. ''Sometimes they ran eight shuttles a day. They were civilians and had no benefits, not even death benefits.''</p>
        <p>The American Airpower Museum is opening just a few months before the Cradle of Aviation Museum, which is to open at Mitchel Field in Garden City next year. Both sides say there's no competition. ''They're a small museum focusing on World War II with a half-dozen flyable World War II planes,'' said Josh Stoff, curator of the Cradle of Aviation. ''We cover the entire 20th century and beyond.''</p>
        <p>But Farmingdale has something the Cradle will not: flyable planes. Demonstration flights are planned for Republic Field, and for a donation of $350 visitors will be able to sign up for flights on the planes that are big enough to carry passengers.</p>
        <p>Even on the ground, there is the sense of being there as one scrambles through the cramped B-17, smelling the grease and aviation fuel, touching the bruised frame and trying to imagine the fear -- enhanced by claustrophobia and freezing cold -- that a B-17 crew must have felt on a high-altitude bombing mission over Europe.</p>
        <p>The students toured the briefing room, which was filled with authentic gear. (The silk scarf with a map of Germany, intended for use by downed airmen trying to escape, was a favorite.) Before he knew it, Hassan was modeling the uniform of a World War II pilot.</p>
        <p>''This place is pretty neat,'' said Hassan, who would like to return. ''You can almost feel what they went through.''</p>
        <p>As the P-47 arrived at the dedication ceremony on Wednesday, Harry Love fought back tears. The retired major, from Rosedale, Queens, was a B-17 bombardier who was shot down over Germany in 1944 and was a prisoner of war for nine months.</p>
        <p>''Those P-47's were our cover, our protection,'' he said. ''This is the first one I've seen in 50 years. I have such a feeling of pride and exhilaration. Seeing these planes come back to life is like a reincarnation. It's our freedom coming back.''</p>
