        <p>Before the onslaught of summer, when the atmosphere and the wine-tasting psychology make heavy-duty reds beside the point, it seemed wise to try Pellegrini's '97 cabernet franc. A second reason is that there is not a lot left at the winery: some 60 cases. The winery is limiting each customer to four.</p>
        <p>The wine, 100 percent cabernet franc, has a sultry -- O.K., sexy -- bouquet. Like most Long Island cabernet franc (a cousin of cabernet sauvignon), it is earthy. But this one is also agreeably funky, and the flavor is dotted with herbal notes. Within 20 minutes of the uncorking, this dry wine started evolving toward a ''sweetness'' that heightened its immediate approachability.</p>

        <p>Before the onslaught of summer, when the atmosphere and the wine-tasting psychology make heavy-duty reds beside the point, it seemed wise to try Pellegrini's '97 cabernet franc. A second reason is that there is not a lot left at the winery: some 60 cases. The winery is limiting each customer to four.</p>
        <p>The wine, 100 percent cabernet franc, has a sultry -- O.K., sexy -- bouquet. Like most Long Island cabernet franc (a cousin of cabernet sauvignon), it is earthy. But this one is also agreeably funky, and the flavor is dotted with herbal notes. Within 20 minutes of the uncorking, this dry wine started evolving toward a ''sweetness'' that heightened its immediate approachability.</p>
        <p>Pellegrini's cabernet franc is not for the faint-hearted and picky eaters. It is powerful, muscular, robust.</p>
        <p>Part of the flavor-drenching stems from the wine's being unfiltered; another part, I like to fantasize, comes from the stylistic predispositions of the winemaker, Russell Hearn, who is Australian-born and sometimes, to consumers' benefit, seems to think of most reds as shirazes.</p>
        <p>Before long, this $17 wine will be history, except perhaps for a small quantity retained in the winery's library. East End producers are optimistic about the grape, and it is instructive for the staff to sample a bottle a year in order to trace a vintage's life cycle.</p>
        <p>If you must open the wine from July through September, wait for a cool night, and mate it with a steak that has the girth of a first baseman's mitt.</p>
