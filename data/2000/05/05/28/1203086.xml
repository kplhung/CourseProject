        <p>Filling up for the Memorial Day weekend, drivers paid as much for gasoline as they did at the height of the oil price spike in March.</p>
        <p>This time, though, it's not OPEC's fault. Low inventories of gasoline and a scramble to introduce a cleaner-burning reformulated fuel across much of the nation have tightened supplies -- especially in the Midwest -- just at the start of the summer driving season.</p>
        <p>While $1.53 a gallon is the highest average gas price ever, adjusted for inflation, it is still cheaper to fill up the family sports utility vehicle than it was to top off the Model T, noted Daniel Yergin, author of ''The Prize,'' a history of the oil industry and president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates. In 1918, using today's dollars, gasoline approached $3 a gallon.</p>
        <p>''Everybody is going to notice it this weekend,'' Mr. Yergin said of the rising prices. But he added, ''On an inflation-adjusted basis, it's still cheaper than it's been in most of the last 80 years.'' That sort of historical perspective may be small comfort to drivers paying 40 cents a gallon more than last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yergin, like most experts, believes prices may rise higher this summer.</p>
