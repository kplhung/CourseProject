        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The lead article in the May 14 Real Estate section, ''The Elderly Face Housing Choices,'' was an excellent summary of options offered to the elderly for estate and Medicaid planning.</p>
        <p>One caveat (to use a favorite word of lawyers) to any person considering transferring a primary residence to children to reduce one's wealth for estate-tax purposes, rather than for nursing home/Medicaid purposes:</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The lead article in the May 14 Real Estate section, ''The Elderly Face Housing Choices,'' was an excellent summary of options offered to the elderly for estate and Medicaid planning.</p>
        <p>One caveat (to use a favorite word of lawyers) to any person considering transferring a primary residence to children to reduce one's wealth for estate-tax purposes, rather than for nursing home/Medicaid purposes:</p>
        <p>Even if capital gains and gift-tax issues are overcome, one should not ignore the common scenario of prudent, conservative senior citizens transferring a major asset -- their home -- to members of a younger generation who statistically are far more likely than their elders to get involved in uninsured or underinsured lawsuits, messy divorces, bankruptcies resulting from overspending or from a business going sour, and numerous other catastrophes.</p>
        <p>If this occurs, grandma's house (along with her status as an occupant) goes on the table as an asset of her imprudent or unlucky child.</p>
        <p>A far less risky course to reduce wealth for estate-tax purposes is to transfer to children nonprimary residence assets such as stocks and bonds.</p>
