        <p>The night was getting wild, the air tense with expectation, as the crowd at a military academy here waited for the show's top act, three female Ivoirian dancers known as Les Tueuses, or The Killers. Until last December, Les Tueuses, the queens of a suggestive dance craze called the mapouka, had been banned from television, judged too vulgar by the government, which was subsequently toppled in a Christmas Eve coup.</p>
        <p>Their reputation rehabilitated under military rule, Les Tueuses finally took the stage recently, quickly shedding their diaphanous white robes in favor of blue sequined bikini tops and long skirts with, of course, never-ending slits. As uniformed soldiers stretched to keep the crowd of hundreds under control, Les Tueuses plunged into the audience, targeting a cadet here, another there, leaving the young men, and women spectators, dazed under a blur of gyration and wiggling.</p>
        <p>''I adore mapouka, but I especially like Les Tueuses,'' said Eliane Meledje, a 25-year-old seamstress, who had traveled several hours from her neighborhood of Yopougon to attend the show at the academy outside Abidjan on this Saturday night. ''With them, you feel liberated.''</p>
        <p>The army is still in charge in this West African nation. The military ruler, Gen. Robert Guei, has yet to announce elections or whether he will run, to the dismay of international donors who are staying away. But as the political transition drags on in what was once the most stable country in West Africa, an unexpected entry in the winners' column has been mapouka, a dance that had been treated in official corners as something like an infectious disease.</p>
        <p>Banned from Ivoirian television -- chased away by officials in neighboring countries like Togo, Niger, Burkina Faso and Benin -- mapouka spread nevertheless along the West African coast, from Dakar to Kinshasa, in the last couple of years. The dance -- which focuses on, though is not limited to, the surprisingly difficult act of wiggling one's buttocks without moving one's hips -- also became an endless source of discussions and newspaper ruminations on culture, sex, women and men, especially here in the Ivory Coast.</p>
        <p>It was perhaps a measure of the fallen government's disconnection with its 16 million citizens that it tried to ban mapouka, even as the dance grew so popular that many young women desperately tried to gain weight -- the better to perform a dance that works best with an ample backside. After the military took power, it seemed that the new government's first major policy shift was directed at mapouka.</p>
        <p>The dance popped up on television. Les Tueuses led a performance for soldiers at the national stadium here, and their photos appeared on the front pages of newspapers, including the government-controlled ones. Then, on the day before their recent Saturday show at the military academy, Les Tueuses put on a private show for General Guei himself.</p>
        <p>''The president loves mapouka,'' said one of the dancers, known as Victorine the Viper, before the show in the stadium. ''During our show yesterday, we saw him move his head, his feet. But we have to admit that we, Les Tueuses, have three kinds of shows: one for TV, one for our regular show, and one for officials. In front of the president, we couldn't show him our buttocks and shake them under his eyes.''</p>
        <p>The mapouka became popular in the nightclubs of Abidjan before catching on abroad. Congo has traditionally been the big exporter of music and dance in Africa, and so the mapouka was something of a first for the Ivory Coast.</p>
        <p>The dance is believed to be the descendant of a far tamer, traditional dance in the country's coastal regions. By the time it had reached Abidjan, though, the dance was performed mostly by young women who bent and shook in ways that men could never duplicate.</p>
        <p>Despite Abidjan's fairly easy-going cultural climate, Ivoirian national television yanked video clips of popular performers, saying that the mapouka did not follow the ''rules of good behavior.'' Some criticized mapouka dancers for supposedly debasing the country's cultural heritage.</p>
        <p>''They have turned it into a depraved dance to the point that the Ivory Coast became notorious, known in the region because of it,'' said Jacques Powply, a cultural critic at Le Jour, a newspaper based here. ''To me, it's lewd pleasures sought by men who want to corrupt our original dance.''</p>
        <p>Others pointed out that suggestive dancing was nothing new to the region. But the mapouka had upset officials, they said, because the dance left out men.</p>
        <p>''The real problem with mapouka,'' said Valen Guede, a musicologist and director of the Ivoirian Office of Authors' Rights, ''lies in the fact that this dance can be danced only by women, and only by a plump woman with a generous behind. All of sudden, men are pushed to the sidelines.''</p>
        <p>Still, the dance caught on. As young women sought to outperform one another, a large posterior became de rigueur. Contrary to the beauty standards of the West, fleshiness is regarded as attractive in both women and men in Africa, a sign of wealth and health on a poor continent. But mapouka made plumpness fashionable even among Westernized young women who had toyed with slimness.</p>
        <p>''Women started saying that fleshy was beautiful, and that one had to be at least chubby,'' said Konate Yacouba, an author and member of the National Institute of the Arts. ''Some who had been dieting made an about-face and even started taking vitamin pills to fatten up.''</p>
        <p>With the military's relaxed, if not enthusiastic, attitude toward the mapouka, success looms large for Les Tueuses -- at least until the next dance craze. The trio has recently gone on foreign tours, including to New York and Montreal, said their manager, John Chahin Sombo.</p>
        <p>Backstage just before their recent performance, the dancers defended the mapouka against criticism of lewdness and female exploitation.</p>
        <p>''You know, our fans are made up in great part of women,'' said a dancer who goes by the name Julie the Supple. ''Women become as delirious as men. The mapouka is a phenomenon for everyone.''</p>
        <p>One 16-year-old girl who came to the show, Amie Gbane, said she was a big fan of Victorine the Viper.</p>
        <p>''She has a wicked look and dances really well,'' Miss Gbane said. ''I'd love to dance like them.''</p>
        <p>But a 43-year-old nurse, who gave only her last name, Kone, said she had come only to keep an eye on her two sons in the audience.</p>
        <p>''I don't understand why the cadets invited them, but they must have their own reason,'' said Mrs. Kone. ''Look at how delirious they're becoming! I don't like it when the dancers leave the stage and come provoke the men in their seats. It embarrasses me greatly, and it's the reason why I preferred asking Mr. Kone, my husband, to stay at home.''</p>
