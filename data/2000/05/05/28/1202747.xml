        <p>MotherKind</p>
        <p>By Jayne Anne Phillips.</p>
        <p>292 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Alfred A. Knopf. $24.</p>
        <p>Kate is daughter to a mother whose cancer is killing her slowly in the guest room. She is mother to a baby tumbling through the vertiginous time travel of its first year. She lives with a kind and tolerant man -- if Herbert Marcuse hadn't formulated ''repressive tolerance,'' Kate could have. She is stepmother to his two rambunctious and suspicious sons.</p>
        <p>But who is she? A caretaker, she thinks at times. An ayah in an indulgent Indian household (she had traveled in India and Nepal when younger, a poet, and free). Tugged at four extremities -- her heart stuck on center -- Kate is staked out over the crossroads of death and three different orders of life, all of them hers. Or none of them hers.</p>
        <p>''MotherKind'' tells of a year or so in the life of Kate and her family. Pregnant, she brought Katherine, her mother, up from her home in the South to live out a last remission that will give way to a terminal decline. Her baby, Alexander, is born after a hard labor and delivery, followed by the nightmarish swoon of the first months' sleeplessness and troubled nursing.</p>
        <p>It will be a while before Matthew, her doctor lover, can marry her. Meanwhile she is saddled with ministering part time to the moodiness and confusion of Matthew's sons, Sam and Jonah, and dealing with the gravitational pull upon father and sons of Matthew's wife, whose infidelity smashed their marriage and whose resentments have slowed their divorce.</p>
        <p>Jayne Anne Phillips has written searchingly of several kinds of wild side. In ''Machine Dreams'' and the short stories of ''Fast Lanes'' she treated the unsettled and the outraged, displaced to the edges of our domestic and social structures. In ''Shelter,'' a glittering part-Gothic novel that received less notice than it deserved, it was the storms from inside and outside sweeping through a girls' camp in the West Virginia mountains.</p>
        <p>''MotherKind'' -- the name of a household-help service that Kate resorts to -- is different. It aims, I think, to be a wild side but at home and under wraps; like the fox gnawing out the vitals of the boy who hid it inside his shirt and smiled.</p>
        <p>Phillips's gift is for stretching lives taut until they shriek like guitar strings snapping. Here she stretches them more quietly in what has become a familiar genre: a domestic novel about characters struggling to decode the lean messages of suburban existence through the encumbered signals that carry them. Her once-wandering Kate had thought of herself as an adept of the lean. Now, confronted with two essentials -- birth and death -- she is clogged by errands, birthday parties, emotional balancings and the expectations of others.</p>
        <p>All too frequently ''MotherKind'' and its own lean message (Kate's plight is as real as many another literary way we live now) is clogged in the same sense and by these same things. Perhaps Phillips has identified too closely with her protagonist. A fictional character is engendered by artistic compassion and artistic ruthlessness. However lavishly fashioned, it requires relinquishing; birds don't fly unless nourished, but nourishment's only purpose is flight. It is a dialectic Phillips has previously wielded, often thrillingly.</p>
        <p>There are some splendid passages in the new novel. Sometimes it is a phrase: ''Kate grew larger as her mother grew smaller'' -- the ringmaster's whip-crack that launches the performance. Or another, as Kate nuzzles the just-born Alexander and feels ''the pump and peppered skittle of his heart.'' There is a longer, climactic exchange that evokes the nobility of a mother's and daughter's hail and farewell.</p>
        <p>It comes a while before the end: Katherine can still walk, and has fallen at night trying to put her dog outside. She didn't want to disturb Kate, she tells her; and Kate hugs her with a convulsive ''Oh, don't!'' Then, whispering ''desperately, without thinking: 'How much longer do we have? Think of all the nights I won't hear you! You won't be able to call me --.' ''Kate feels her anguish as a wave and her mother, borne up, floats above it:</p>
        <p>''Her touch on Kate's hair lingered like a passage of shadow. 'I won't need to then. I'll have gone, just as full of hopes for you.' ''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, there are many pages that the writing fails to bring to life. There is simply too much suburban domesticity lacking the kind of transformation that an Updike or an Anne Tyler or an Alice McDermott is able to achieve. Talk of furniture, diapers, confidences with a neighbor and with a young woman from MotherKind are like picking up on a crossed wire in a culturally enlightened area code.</p>
        <p>Matthew's consolatory wit is not very witty; for that reason, perhaps, it fails to console. Set scenes -- a birthday party, a lunch, even Kate's and Matthew's tardy wedding -- are full of accurate but inert detail, adorned as much as written. Equally an adornment and with little conviction are occasional references to Kate's poetry.</p>
        <p>The emotions in ''MotherKind'' and the questions it explores are well founded and convincing, though more as confirmation than illumination. The relationships -- Katherine and Kate, Katherine and her former husband, Kate and Matthew, Kate and her stepsons -- are thoughtfully set out. With an exception or two, though, the relationships are more real than the characters in them. Matthew, his two sons and several others occupy a good deal of space without really filling it. In Katherine there is the faint perfume of a life: proper, independent and, in her dying, open to understated discovery.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most suggestive character is Waylon, Kate's father, who is divorced from Katherine. Big, stolid, inexpressive, he is taken for granted; yet, on a brief visit, he fills the page. He is the sound of silence in a world of talk. ''My father lives in the unspoken,'' Kate says, ''and when I'm with him I live there too.'' It is her only real bit of travel out of the MotherKind world (apart from some unachieved dream scenes from her time in India), and for the reader it's stepping outdoors after too long inside.</p>
        <p>For all that she is protagonist and moral center of her story, Kate is curiously indistinct. She is faultlessly placed and constructed; she is genuinely admirable, yet her situation is more affecting than she is. Perhaps it is because through much of ''MotherKind'' the events that befall Kate and the people she comes up against are recounted not as themselves but as her feelings about them. ''Remarks aren't literature,'' Gertrude Stein once said. Feelings aren't, either.</p>
