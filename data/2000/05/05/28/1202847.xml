        <p>NEW JERSEY today has a once-in-a-century opportunity. When the state Supreme Court ordered the construction and rehabilitation of schools in the poorest districts, it opened the way to the largest public works program in the state's history, even bigger than building the New Jersey Turnpike two generations ago.</p>
        <p>The Legislature and the governor appear to be drawing closer to approving legislation to start these sorely needed projects. But so far the debate in the State House has failed to produce a program that can make the most of this enormous opportunity. With a little vision, this program could not only rebuild urban schools but also help revitalize entire communities.</p>
        <p>A well-designed school construction program can improve educational outcomes and strengthen neighborhoods and families. Each school project can be planned with community development as a cornerstone. Schools can include spaces that might be a school nurse's office by day and a community health clinic during nonschool hours. Preschool centers should be included as a matter of course. Recreational, library and meeting space should serve students and the community, year round. California now requires that school planners consider these community-building features. Chicago's  new school construction program also emphasizes community schools. Across the country, schools have  built banking or food-shopping space into their buildings for job training or located in department stores or hospitals to provide exposure to careers and reinforce educational experiences.</p>
        <p>New Jersey has not grasped the importance of gaining this potential  leverage because it has not tapped the creativity of local communities in planning schools. The State House wants to centralize the financing, fiscal oversight and construction of schools into a single state agency.  While the Economic Development Authority surely could provide financing and fiscal oversight and accountability, it lacks experience in actually managing construction programs of this range and scope. More seriously, it lacks familiarity with local schools and neighborhood  needs. To maintain public confidence  that huge sums are being spent wisely, New Jersey needs a sound system of state-level financing and fiscal control. But it also needs to harness  the creativity and responsiveness of local planning and management.</p>
        <p>New Jersey's cities do not lack for community organizations, business  interests and concerned parents who want to improve their schools and  neighborhoods. It is at the local level that coordination and community involvement will produce the synergies needed to improve both school and neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>To enjoy even greater leverage from this investment, each project should incorporate job training, apprenticeship opportunities and local hiring goals for young men and women in the neighborhoods. The school  construction program can start thousands of young people in good jobs where they can develop the traits and habits crucial to success in any career. But such programs are not assured under the currently debated legislation.</p>
        <p>It is past time for the other two branches of government to abide by the Supreme Court's order and provide 100 percent funding for school construction in the Abbott Districts, those cited by the court. But many poor communities not covered by the court order should also be helped. Aid to those districts should be based on need, and provided through a rational formula to avoid further delaying new schools in the poorest districts while this contentious issue is resolved.</p>
        <p>Through the recently formed Coalition for Our Children's Schools leaders from business, government, education and the nonprofit community are working to raise the level of awareness of this opportunity. If New Jersey does this right, our children, our communities and the entire state will benefit. If we dont, the chance might never come again, and we will fail to make the most of this enormous public investment.</p>
