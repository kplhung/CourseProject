        <p>THE verdicts came in a downpour of piety only hours after Latrell Sprewell's infamous choking of his coach, P. J. Carlesimo, in December 1997.</p>
        <p>The Detroit News: ''Today, athletes spit at umpires, attack teammates on the practice field and, in the case of Golden State Warriors guard Latrell Sprewell, put a stranglehold on their coach and threaten to kill him.''</p>
        <p>The New York Daily News: ''Sprewell still doesn't understand he crossed a line. Maybe he is another athlete who doesn't think there are any lines at all.''</p>
        <p>CBS News: ''In an era when millionaire athletes routinely behave like spoiled brats . . .''</p>
        <p>The San Francisco Chronicle: ''Sprewell's behavior escalated to this point because pro athletes so rarely face consequences commensurate with their indiscretions.''</p>
        <p>The Los Angeles Times: ''So here we sit, knocked flat by another pro athlete without a moral compass.''</p>
        <p>Those were just a few of the 487 news dispatches about Sprewell that week featuring the word athlete, almost always as a generalization. Sports Illustrated dubbed him ''not so much a person as an issue''; in one harrowing lesson, readers were told, he had taught us everything we needed to know about sports stars.</p>
        <p>Two years later, after Sprewell's run-and-gun skills have helped make the New York Knicks contenders for the National Basketball Association championship, the moral has ripened into one that is more difficult to swallow. Sprewell is now one of the most popular athletes in New York, even embraced by the league itself in commercials. His metamorphosis from pariah to prodigy is a lesson all its own, less about athletes than their audience.</p>
        <p>IN sports there is a half-life to public disdain, an inevitable erosion that typically takes two to three years. Even the most hardened opinions give way to the exhilaration of tape-measure home runs or monster dunks, especially when delivered in a home uniform. Those instants of inebriation are the ultimate subliminal advertising: without even knowing it, fans get nudged toward thinking, ''Well, he can't be that bad.''</p>
        <p>In Sprewell's case, his capricious and occasionally reckless style of play after joining the Knicks went from crass to charismatic, particularly because it energized an otherwise dull club. (He has also gone over two years without choking his coach.) Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy has said that New York ''loves reclamation projects,'' and he's right. After all, drug offenders like Lawrence Taylor, Dwight Gooden and Darryl Strawberry have repeatedly returned to ovations that only get louder and louder.</p>
        <p>Gotham is so renowned for welcoming visiting offenders, however, that Shea Stadium security is quaking at the impending arrival of the Atlanta Braves's John Rocker on June 29. Six months after his xenophobic rant about New Yorkers, Rocker is midway through the vindication cycle -- his hometown fans are cheering him, while opposing crowds still punish him with boos and threats. One Los Angeles Dodgers fan even ran out onto the field as Rocker prepared to pitch and mooned him. (Alas, the gesture lost some edge when the fan later accepted $500 from an Atlanta radio station to meet Rocker face-to-face, and the two shook hands and yukked it up during batting practice.)</p>
        <p>Why are Braves fans cheering Rocker, and why will he ultimately find the same national absolution as Sprewell and Roberto Alomar, who spit on an umpire in 1996 and finds little trouble anymore? Partly because of his talent, but also because today's media culture so excoriates its chosen malefactors so self-righteously for so long that they become victims themselves. (In an Internet poll following Jim Gray's aggressive interview of Pete Rose on NBC last October, 92 percent of fans said they wanted the convicted gambler back in baseball.)</p>
        <p>This sympathy has less to do with forgiveness than with redistributing blame. Also boredom: as the 24-hour sports channels have found other sideshows to harp on -- the National Football League now has not one but two players accused of murder -- Rocker is on his way to being old news, left to lie fallow until his career blooms anew.</p>
        <p>SPREWELL navigated the road to redemption perfectly last season. He wore wire-rimmed glasses during interviews to appear less threatening, but retained the corn-row hairdo that kept him hip. He spoke of just trying to fit in, while starring in a sneaker commercial so contrite about his past behavior that he proclaimed himself ''The American Dream.'' Perhaps he was. Months later, the Knicks signed Sprewell to a $62 million contract.</p>
        <p>Now, as he seeks to propel the Knicks to the N.B.A. finals, Sprewell's days as a lightning rod for athlete villainy seem a lifetime away. Back then, The Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel said the firestorm was ''a referendum on the modern athlete.'' It was about more than that, and the verdict is in.</p>
