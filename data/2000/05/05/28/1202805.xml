        <p>Reagan Early (kneeling, left): ''Me and a bunch of girlfriends went to the beach. We looked for guys, tried to get a tan and made fun of people. The better you look and better you think you look, the more confident you are. But as soon as you see someone prettier or skinnier, then your confidence is shot to hell, and that's basically what high school is. One girl we don't like -- she's real popular, but we were saying, 'At least she doesn't look good in a bathing suit.' I wish I could be more carefree, but I get self-conscious. I think about my behind. That day, I wanted to wear shorts.''</p>
        <p>Kimberly Rutland (kneeling, center): ''We saw a big group of people posing. I was thinking, Since somebody was taking pictures of them, they had to be doing something right. So we were, like, 'Are you guys models?' But I didn't think they were supermodels. Then everyone was watching us, thinking, Are they famous? It made me feel really good. Don't get me wrong -- I was trying to suck in. But I had just gotten the suit, and I was glad the picture was taken that day instead of in a not-so-favorite bikini.''</p>
        <p>Ali Stephenson (kneeling, right): ''How you feel on the beach depends on how confident you look in a suit. It could be beneficial: guys at this age care about looks. I think my group of friends are all good-looking. I find that most Floridians are. My dad lives in Indiana, and people there are not that attractive. I was having a good day. Maybe it's just the fact that I have good self-esteem and my friends are the same.''</p>
        <p>Jason Highsmith (standing, third from left): ''Everybody poses when I'm with my friends. We sit on the beach and talk about the girls that walk by. Then when you go walk, you are part of the crowd that gets looked at. It's funny too -- most of the girls won't eat breakfast, afraid to look fat. I was real comfortable. I felt like, This is cool, everybody looking at us.''</p>
        <p>Sarah Rosensteel (second from top): ''We thought, Oh, this looks like fun. But I was a little self-conscious, because I'm not real photogenic. It definitely entered my head, Do I look O.K.? If a guy meets you at the beach, they are looking at what you look like in a bra and underwear. I'm standing there half-naked. It's awkward. When I see them at school, I think my guy friends are picturing me in a bathing suit.''</p>
        <p>Donna Degain (top): ''I was thinking, I hope they don't drop me.''</p>
