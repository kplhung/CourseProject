        <p>The Nautical Mile in Freeport, a popular strip lined with seafood shops, restaurants and boating stores, was officially reopened last week, marking the end of a $6 million renovation intended to make the street trendier -- and more flood resistant.</p>
        <p>The street, otherwise known as Woodcleft Avenue, was raised by more than two feet at its lowest section to end the persistent flooding that over the years has ruined businesses and hurt tourism. Gas and utility lines were buried to clean up the view. The two-year project included new brick walkways and replicas of 1920's-style gaslights.</p>
        <p>''Woodcleft Avenue had been declining for more than a decade as a result of persistent flooding and water damage,'' said Mayor William F. Glacken. Before renovations, village officials had to warn residents to move their cars north every time a big storm approached, as often as 120 times a year.</p>
        <p>Money for the project came from federal, state and local governments.</p>
