      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>By the time I was 12 and started working summers, my family had been in the Pepsi bottling business for 40 years, and was running into a new type of competition: A company called Pop Shop was selling cases of soda directly to consumers at wholesale prices.</p>
        <p>Our family said, well, if someone's going to slit our throats, we might as well slit our own. So we started our own version of a wholesale chain, the Pop House, which sold cases of 30-ounce bottles to consumers, even as our regular bottling plant continued to sell to supermarkets. I started out in the new facility, unscrewing the caps on bottles that were returned for recycling.</p>

        <p>By the time I was 12 and started working summers, my family had been in the Pepsi bottling business for 40 years, and was running into a new type of competition: A company called Pop Shop was selling cases of soda directly to consumers at wholesale prices.</p>
        <p>Our family said, well, if someone's going to slit our throats, we might as well slit our own. So we started our own version of a wholesale chain, the Pop House, which sold cases of 30-ounce bottles to consumers, even as our regular bottling plant continued to sell to supermarkets. I started out in the new facility, unscrewing the caps on bottles that were returned for recycling.</p>
        <p>Every summer after that, until I graduated from college at 21, I worked in the family plant, moving up the ladder until I had my own truck route for deliveries, complete with commissions.</p>
        <p>For a while, I was part of a two-man team that packed bottles in cases, stacked them on a forklift, and drove them to storage. By slightly changing the way the cases were transferred to the forklift, and rescheduling the times when the forklift went to storage, I turned it into a one-man job. I went to Dad, said ''I'm doing this myself,'' and he gave me a 50-cent-an hour raise.</p>
        <p>From those jobs, I learned how important brand awareness is, and how hard it is to get shelf space. So when Cisco decided to sell Internet boxes for home use, I resisted the retailing route. We'll let Bell Atlantic, Time Warner and others package our boxes with their systems.</p>
        <p>On the case-stacking job, I learned that you can get a lot more productivity if you don't resort purely to linear thinking.</p>
        <p>But one lesson just doesn't seem to apply anymore. On the truck route, I learned that if you worked extra hard in the morning, you got to take the afternoon off. These days, if you work hard in the morning, you get to work hard at new stuff in the afternoon.</p>
