        <p>Cape May ''diamonds'' have probably been washing up on Sunset Beach at the extreme southern tip of New Jersey for as long as the Delaware River has emptied into the Atlantic Ocean. But only in recent times have the quartz rocks, which can be polished and cut for jewelry like diamonds, have been prized. The rocks, in raw or cut form, are a popular souvenir for tourists who visit Lower Township beach for the sunset and a ceremony in which the American flag is lowered -- the tiny beach is one of the few places on the East Coast where the sun can be viewed going down over unobstructed water.</p>
        <p>Marvin Hume, whose family has made a living for 27 years with a gift shop, food stand and clothing store at Sunset Beach, conducts the flag lowering each evening. He talked recently about Sunset Beach and Cape May diamonds.</p>
        <p>Q. Where do Cape May diamonds come from?</p>
        <p>A. The rocks are from the hills up around the Delaware Water Gap. They break off and are carried down the river for more than 100 miles to the bay. There are such fierce riptides out there where the Delaware Bay and Atlantic Ocean meet that the rocks are swirled around, and a lot of them end up getting dumped here on the beach. You find the most of them after a big storm, but tourists are out here all year looking for them.</p>
        <p>There is a concrete ship that is sunk just off the beach and it causes the water to catch the stones and wash them up on the beach. The ship was an experimental design during World War I that was used briefly, then it was hauled here to be part of a ferry service from Cape May to Lewes, Delaware. The ship, the Atlantus,  went aground during a storm and no one was able to free it, so it is still there sticking out of the water.</p>
        <p>Q. What do you look for in a quartz rock?</p>
        <p>A. The rocks look white or beige and can be any size up to the size of a goose egg. The more transparent the rock the better it will be for a piece of jewelry, but you can polish any hard rock. These are quartz, which is 7.5 on the hardness scale and will cut glass; diamonds are a 10. With the bigger rocks it is harder to tell which ones are clear. You also have to make sure the rock doesn't have any cracks in it.</p>
        <p>Q. What do you do with the rocks?</p>
        <p>A. Tourists will come down here and collect them for years and then eventually they buy a rock tumbler, which can polish three or six pounds of rocks at a time, depending on which size tumbler you have. It takes three weeks to do it. You cover the rocks with water and put in silicone carbide, which looks like gray sand. Each week you put in a finer grain of silicone carbide until the rocks are perfectly smooth and polished. Because it takes years, maybe hundreds of years, for the rocks to wash down here from the hills, the first stage of polishing is already done when you pick them up off the beach. But until it is polished, a lot of times you can't be sure you have a good quartz stone.</p>
        <p>Q. What kind of jewelry can be made from Cape May diamonds?</p>
        <p>A. Anything you can do with a diamond can be done with a Cape May diamond. These are considered semiprecious stones. We polish them for everything from paper weights to pendants to key chains. Or we have a professional cut them and then we set them as almost anything -- rings, earrings, necklaces, cufflinks, tie tacks. Jewelry runs from $10 to $50 or $60 retail. A lot of jewelers in town sell Cape May diamonds.</p>
