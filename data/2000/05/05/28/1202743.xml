        <p>The Poet and the Age.</p>
        <p>Volume II: Revolution and Renunciation (1790-1803).</p>
        <p>By Nicholas Boyle.</p>

        <p>No writer has lived on a grander scale than Goethe. Nicholas Boyle's magnificent biography recounts that life with all the nobility it deserves. Volume I -- universally acclaimed when it was published in 1991 -- told the tale from Goethe's birth in 1749 through the heroic days of the Sturm und Drang down to the early classical period in Weimar marked by the writing of ''Iphigenia'' and ''Tasso.'' This second volume, ''Revolution and Renunciation,'' recounts Goethe's astounding middle years, during which he settled down with Christiana Vulpius, founded a family, became director of the Weimar Theater, entered the world of politics and advised Duke Carl August on mining and Jena University. Immensely productive, he wrote ''Contributions on Optics,'' concluded ''Wilhelm Meister's Apprenticeship,'' resumed ''Faust'' and produced innumerable plays, poems and tales.</p>
        <p>Boyle's unrivaled knowledge and generosity of spirit make this not just a supreme biography, but one of the finest works on the 18th century. It effects a major revaluation of the ''Goethezeit,'' a Golden Age in European culture that, even in Germany, has yet to be properly analyzed. With passionate sobriety, he reassesses what other critics call Weimar Classicism -- when Herder, Goethe and Schiller pursued a redemptive ''humanit</p>
        <p>With bold originality, Boyle finds coherence in Goethe's bewilderingly protean life by placing it in the context of two revolutions: the one in France, and the Kantian revolution in philosophy, which Germans greeted as a corrective to politics abroad. These poles, the social and the philosophical, provide an axis for Boyle's dialectic, enabling him to place the poet in the age.</p>
        <p>He narrates Goethe's experiences during the revolutions with great verve, evoking both wider strategies and the whiff of gunshot, notably during the battle of Valmy and the siege of Mainz. Here he writes like a history painter, a technique acquired from Goethe, ironically exploiting his tableau to correct the stereotype of the Olympian poet, remote from the politics of his day and, by extension, our own. Evoking what Goethe saw, Boyle reshapes our hold on his mind: killings and death without honor, chaotic retreats, looted villages, pillage, uprooted families. The poet is set among suffering that dwarfs the local anguish of Goethe's Werther: he recklessly exposes himself to a cannonade, broods over destruction and emerges stricken, his Leibnizian optimism undone by the ferocity of war. If at Valmy he did not quite say ''a new epoch'' had begun, he knew it, and henceforth had to wring meaning out of chaos</p>
        <p>Boyle's Goethe is our contemporary. As Boyle pointedly argues, since the French Revolution marked the birth of a ''mass society'' and ''total war,'' Goethe's world resembled our own. Yet he fails to show that Goethe had any real grasp of concepts like the ''masses'' or ''ideology,'' and his method exacts penalties in his accounts of Goethe's works. Perhaps because he projects Goethe's and Schiller's Kantian answer to the French Revolution, perhaps because his categories have little hold on so carnivalesque a text, Boyle has almost nothing to say about Goethe's first response to the revolution: ''Reynard the Fox,'' actually written amid cannon fire.</p>
        <p>He claims Goethe dismissed ''Reynard'' as a failure, ''hovering'' between a translation and an adaptation. I doubt it. Goethe's word (''schweben'') denotes an aesthetic ideal. It is odd to neglect a text that directly reflects on the carnage: where Reynard has Brown Bear almost skinned alive, we feel the raw life behind the bloody image. Odder still to ignore the poem's judgment. For the revolution (Goethe's sympathies with which Boyle largely intuits) we need to hear Reynard say, ''The king steals as well as any man.'' And against, ''the worst thing'' is when ''false prophets'' ''deceive mankind'' into believing the ''delusion'' that ''it can judge and control its fate.'' Here are Goethe's categories. He is not talking about ''mass movements,'' but about what Lessing and others damned as ''enthusiasm'' (''schw</p>
        <p>In effect Boyle deconstructs the accepted view of Weimar Classicism to argue that, through Kant, and by an act of ''renunciation,'' Goethe learned to create a modern, fictive, ''multiple self,'' intimate with life's tragic chaos. The construct is fine, even if not quite Kant's concept of ''personality,'' for by it Boyle demonstrates the urgency of German philosophical idealism, and pursues its effects into the interstices of Goethe's thought. This works with his exemplary exposition of Goethe's ''subjective'' optics; but it is more problematic in the case of ethics and the individual, not least since, as has long been noted, Goethe's discovery of subjectivity preceded Kant.</p>
        <p>However, Boyle's lucid stance on men and ideas enables him to revise the picture of Goethe's relations with Schiller, which prove more complex, competitive and, on Goethe's part, more ironic than hitherto seen, and to explain both the success of Schiller's ''Aesthetic Education'' and the failure of his periodical Horae. Contrastively, he reveals Goethe's links with Jena Romanticism, the intellectual crucible of modernism, setting him among the philosophers Fichte, Schelling and Hegel, the critics August Wilhelm and Friedrich Schlegel and the poets Novalis and HRated PG-13lderlin. These men redefined poetry, literature, philosophy, theology and (less persuasively) science. Boyle shows Goethe's Jena to be ''intellectually speaking . . . the most exciting place in the world.''</p>
        <p>Nobody has better depicted how Goethe lived -- and what a busy day he led, for he is modern in that, too, albeit unmodern in his unhurriedness: the comic writer Jean Paul called him a ''volcano'' smoldering beneath its snowy cover. He grows fat, blows $100 on the lottery, procrastinates over completing ''Wilhelm Meister.'' Against the popular image of the libertine, Boyle demonstrates that the liaison with Christiana was a marriage in all but name. He also wonderfully evokes Goethe the father. Lesser figures are perfectly positioned, and Boyle excels at marshaling the intersections among Germany, the Weimar Court and nearby Jena through friendships, ideas and the inner life, to evoke the wellspring of Goethe's creativity.</p>
        <p>Such a confluence occurs when the poet and Homer translator J. H. Voss visits Weimar in June 1794, and Goethe's youthful optimism returns: ''Germany, or part of it, was coming alive again and coming together.'' The ground for the idyll ''Alexis and Dora'' and the verse epic ''Hermann and Dorothea,'' in the style of Voss's ''Luise,'' is prepared. Boyle's narrative balances friends, mistresses, poets, scientists, academics, chance acquaintances and even officials and gardeners. By handling names and works as leitmotifs, he uncovers across time such seminal inspirations as Goethe's encounter with Mozart's ''Magic Flute.'' At hidden nodal points, he reveals the interface between the private sphere and the public, where Goethe's genius is continually reborn. Only occasionally does he miss a point, as when he misunderstands Chladny's visual demonstration of sound waves, and overlooks an important link: the possibility that music, perhaps even the spirit, may materialize was not lost on Novalis and HRated PG-13lderlin, or on Goethe.</p>
        <p>Through Boyle we witness the protracted genesis of ''Faust'' and ''Wilhelm Meister,'' as Goethe rewrites Renaissance ideals and spiritedly rebuts Descartes, Newton and the revolution. He shows the astounding modernity of the open, Goethean self that irradiates these works, albeit his ''Meister'' interpretation sometimes overtaxes the botanical analogy: the novel bristles with humane rejoinders to the mechanical philosophy. Using his own idea of a universal polarity evident in plant growth, color phenomena, magnetism and the beating heart, Goethe answers Newton's mechanistic ''universal attraction'' by proclaiming a living, dynamic duality that unites God, nature and humanity. Forget the ''two cultures.'' Boyle rehearses Nietzsche's insight that Goethe himself constituted an entire, unified culture.</p>
