        <p>A thousand years ago, Leif Ericson and his crew of Vikings rowed their longships to the rocky shores of Newfoundland, where they founded the first European settlement of North America.

        <p>A thousand years ago, Leif Ericson and his crew of Vikings rowed their longships to the rocky shores of Newfoundland, where they founded the first European settlement of North America. This summer, Newfoundland is host to ''Vikings! 1,000 Years,'' a provincewide festival centered around L'Anse aux Meadows, the only authenticated Norse settlement in North America.</p>
        <p>At the tip of Newfoundland's Northern Peninsula, a coastal region famous for icebergs and seabird colonies, L'Anse aux Meadows  will welcome a flotilla of longships in a re-enactment of Ericson's landing on July 28.</p>
        <p>At Norstead, a newly created ''port of trade'' near the remains of the original sod and timber huts, visitors can watch Viking battles and weddings and learn about ironworking and boat-building from July 17 to Sept. 8.</p>
        <p>Farther down the coast, the pristine fjords and volcanic mountains of Gros Morne National Park look much as they did in Viking times. Travelers can drive between Gros Morne and L'Anse aux Meadows along the scenic Viking Trail, a seaside highway dotted with tiny fishing villages.</p>
        <p>Cities and towns across Newfoundland will join the festivities with a range of cultural events. The exhibition ''Full Circle: First Contact'' will explore the interaction between the Viking newcomers and the aboriginal people they called Skraelings (St. John's Arts and Culture Centre, June 2 to Aug. 6; Corner Brook Museum and Archives, Aug. 25 to Oct. 9).  ''The Spiritual World of the Vikings'' is the title of an exhibition July 16 to Aug. 17 at the Resource Center for the Arts Gallery in St. John's.</p>
        <p>Viking-style longships, including the Snorri, a United States-built vessel that re-created Ericson's journey from Greenland to Newfoundland in 1998, will also stop at ports throughout the province in July.</p>
        <p>Maxxim Vacations of St. John's is offering 7- and 10-night packages including flight, hotel and rental car. Tours from New York or Boston start at $969 a person double occupancy. Information: Maxxim Vacations, (800) 567-6666.</p>
        <p>Details about the ''Vikings! 1,000 Years'' celebration can be found on the Tourism Newfoundland and Labrador Internet site, www.gov.nf.ca/vikings, or by calling (800) 563-6353.</p>
