        <p>Superintendents and school boards in Harrison and Valhalla, NY, will propose reduced budgets in wake of voter rejections; Elmsford, whose school budget was defeated twice, will try again with same budget; retooled school budgets are in works in Bedford and Tuckahoe (S)</p>

        <p>Most county residents endorsed their school districts' budgets in elections earlier this month. But in Bedford, Elmsford, Harrison, Tuckahoe and Valhalla, where the budgets were defeated, officials must decide what to do next. Under state law, districts are allowed two chances to pass a budget before having to adopt an austerity budget for the next academic year. In Harrison and Valhalla, the superintendents and school boards will propose reduced budgets, while Elmsford -- whose budget was defeated by two votes -- intends to try again with the same budget. Bedford's board will meet to consider how to modify the budget for a vote before the end of the school year. In Tuckahoe, a retooled budget is also in the works.</p>
