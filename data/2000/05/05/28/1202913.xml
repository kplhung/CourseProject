        <p>ALTHOUGH it's in the heart of bustling Essex County, N.J., the wealthy 1.3-square-mile Borough of Essex Fells has no apartment buildings, town houses, condominiums, office towers, malls, restaurants, traffic lights or even stores. Because of an ordinance passed by the Borough Council in 1928, commercial activity is confined to one three-story office building that looks like a house and to two tiny workshops at the very end of Manheim Road, a dead-end street.</p>
        <p>''No commerce means no one comes into town unless they live here or are visiting someone who does,'' said Christopher L. Shearin, a textile company executive. He and his wife, Mary, and their three children, ages 5, 8 and 10, moved from California to a seven-bedroom, three-bath colonial on Wootton Road three years ago.</p>

        <p>ALTHOUGH it's in the heart of bustling Essex County, N.J., the wealthy 1.3-square-mile Borough of Essex Fells has no apartment buildings, town houses, condominiums, office towers, malls, restaurants, traffic lights or even stores. Because of an ordinance passed by the Borough Council in 1928, commercial activity is confined to one three-story office building that looks like a house and to two tiny workshops at the very end of Manheim Road, a dead-end street.</p>
        <p>''No commerce means no one comes into town unless they live here or are visiting someone who does,'' said Christopher L. Shearin, a textile company executive. He and his wife, Mary, and their three children, ages 5, 8 and 10, moved from California to a seven-bedroom, three-bath colonial on Wootton Road three years ago.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Shearin said they chose Essex Fells because her husband grew up in nearby Glen Ridge and knew that the borough was ''family-oriented, with exceptional schools.''</p>
        <p>Of the borough's 750 homes, two-thirds were constructed before World War II, and most were custom-built. Many are on lots of several acres, set back 150 feet or more from the winding roads and hidden by stands of oaks, ashes and dogwoods. The styles range from smaller frame colonials  to palatial Tudors.</p>
        <p>This month, Worth magazine ranked Essex Fells as No. 149 on its list of the 250 wealthiest communities in the United States. The median house price of $599,000 has risen $100,000 in the last year. Glen Taylor, the owner of Taylor Real Estate Inc. in neighboring Roseland, said that about a quarter of the properties are now valued at over $1 million, and last year, two lots, each in excess of one acre, sold for $450,000 and $525,000.</p>
        <p>Essex Fells, now surrounded by development, was part of a 13,500-acre tract bought by Newark residents from the Leni Lenape Indians in 1701 for $350 worth of weapons, trinkets and cloth. Called Horse Neck because of its shape, the tract extended all the way from Newark to Cedar Grove.</p>
        <p>One of early the settlers was Samuel Gould, who built a farmhouse off what is now Roseland Avenue in the mid-18th century. One of his descendants was Gen. William Gould, who served as a captain in the New Jersey Militia during the Revolutionary War and commanded the Jersey Blues regiment in the War of 1812. He died in 1847 at the age of 90; his house on Roseland Avenue still exists.</p>
        <p>In 1888, modern-day Essex Fells, then part of Caldwell Township, began taking shape. Anthony Drexel, the Philadelphia banker, learned that the Pennsylvania Railroad was considering extending its service into the area and bought 1,000 acres of rocky terrain, mainly from the estate of General Gould.</p>
        <p>Drexel wanted to create a fine residential community, so he hired a landscape architect to lay out the roads, established the Essex Fells Electric Light and Water Company and built a nine-hole golf course. He named the community after Essex County and John R. Fell, his son-in-law and a major shareholder in the project. The first homes built by Drexel's company were large and rambling, some with 18 rooms and numerous gables, mainly on Rensselaer Road, Oak Lane and Roseland Avenue. Railroad service finally reached Essex Fells in 1891, but it  was discontinued in 1966.</p>
        <p>IN 1902, Essex Fells, seeking to control its development and its school system, split from Caldwell Township and became a borough. By 1905, there were 69 homes. A 1913 map shows the Essex Fells School in its current location on Hawthorne Road and the golf course, now the 18-hole Essex Fells Country Club, on Devon Road, which was then named Golf Road.</p>
        <p>As one might expect in a community where a quarter of the houses are valued at $1 million or more, Essex Fells has its share of trophies. One estate of about seven acres  has a sprawling stone manor with some 12,000 square feet, a two-story library and a vast stone courtyard. Others in the million-plus range have private tennis courts, and a few have indoor pools. One home on Rensselaer Road is notable for its stone turret and for its front door, which came from a 16th-century English castle.</p>
        <p>Midmarket homes in Essex Fells sell for $500,000 to $600,000 and include older colonials and a couple of dozen 1950's four-bedroom colonials or ranches on streets like Tothill Road in the southeast section. At the lower end of the market, a run-down three-bedroom prewar colonial on a 40-by-125-foot lot on Wootton Road in the northwestern section recently sold for $230,000.</p>
        <p>Just a dozen houses are currently listed for sale by the Multiple Listing Service, a deceptively low number said Mr. Taylor, the real estate broker.</p>
        <p>''People here want privacy, so about 40 percent of sellers don't list their homes,'' he said. ''Instead, they quietly ask a broker if he has someone who might want to buy the house. And when we do let the word out, often there are bidding wars for the property.''</p>
        <p>The only rentals are in a handful of two- and three-family houses and carriage houses. These generally go for $1,200 to  $1,500 a month and are rarely advertised,  Mr. Taylor said.</p>
        <p>''With rentals, price isn't the issue,'' he said. ''People here are concerned with security and generally rent to people they know or to law enforcement officers.''</p>
        <p>One of the apartments, for example, is in the former Balt's Candy Store at the corner of Chestnut Lane and Wootton Road, built near the turn of the century. It was converted into a two-family house in the late 1930's and is currently owned by the family of a local historian and lawyer, Charles A. Poekel Jr., who lives in the other apartment.</p>
        <p>Mayor Anne F. Whitehead characterizes the Essex Fells population as mainly families of executives, entrepreneurs and professionals who are willing to pay the high prices because they value ''community and open space.'' A historical footnote: Essex Fells has elected a Republican as mayor in every vote since the borough's founding in 1902.</p>
        <p>Seventeen percent of the land in the borough is publicly owned green space. The 106-acre Trotter Tract, off Buttonwood Road in the northwestern section, is the largest park. It has three soccer fields, one lacrosse field and one basketball court. Probably the most widely used recreational area is the Skating Pond on Fells Road. The pond is filled in winter and then drained in mid-May after the borough's annual fishing derby. During the skating season, Scott Stevens, the New Jersey Devils captain, who lives in Essex Fells, can be seen skating on the pond.</p>
        <p>DESPITE the borough's lack of commercial or industrial sites, taxes are relatively low. Robert M. DiTommaso, the borough administrator, said that  on a home valued at $250,000, taxes would be $5,035, the lowest of the 22 municipalities in Essex County. This is because the Essex Fells Water Company sells water to surrounding towns, a billion gallons last year.</p>
        <p>Mayor Whitehead said that Essex Fells residents were a civic-minded lot: 150 volunteers run the Essex Fells Volunteer Fire Department; others coach the local youth athletic teams and raise money for the Essex Fells Education Foundation and a host of charities.</p>
        <p>Dr. Barbara Strobert, the principal of the  Essex Fells School, which has 240 students in kindergarten through the sixth grade, said that the foundation raised $50,000 and the Parent Teacher Association $20,000 to help equip the 240-student school's new media center. The foundation also supports the school's technology program, which starts in kindergarten, when students are familiarized with computers and digital cameras.</p>
        <p>''We believe that you can't have a modern education without technology,'' Dr. Strobert said. ''We also believe in small class sizes of no more than 18 students, so that the teachers can nurture each child's personality and make that child feel cared for.''</p>
        <p>The students go on to West Essex Regional Junior and Senior High Schools, which have a total of 1,300 students and share a 70-acre campus in North Caldwell. Other municipalities that send students to the two schools are Fairfield, North Caldwell and Roseland.</p>
        <p>The high school has about 700 students, but it offers 16 advanced-placement courses and fields 25 athletic teams, including ice hockey and lacrosse, and has a certified strength coach on its staff. The average class size is 20, one student less than the state average, and all 400 of its computers are connected to the Internet via a high-speed T-1 line.</p>
        <p>On College Board tests last year, West Essex students had combined verbal and mathematics scores of 1087, which was 78 points above the state average. In this year's graduating class of 197 seniors, 98 percent plan to go to college.</p>
