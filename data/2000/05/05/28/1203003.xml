      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Like a lot of her friends in the fashion world, Gina Garan, a video producer and photographer, identifies with dolls. Her muse is Blythe, a collectible retro doll made for one year only, in 1972, who has the eyes of a waif painted by Margaret Keane and is now the subject of Ms. Garan's book, ''This Is Blythe'' (Chronicle Books). This homage is a collection of Ms. Garan's photographs, with Blythe as the latest in the pantheon of ingenues to turn innocence into chic.</p>
        <p>To outfit Blythe, Ms. Garan combined elements of the doll's original groovy wardrobe (granny dresses, dashikis) with clothes from vintage toy stores. When Ms. Garan ran out of options, she fashioned items for Blythe from old socks. Using a smattering of props and a wealth of ingenuity, Ms. Garan has turned her alter ego into a miniature icon, a creature with more fashion incarnations than Madonna and Cindy Sherman combined. Blythe seems to morph from Juliette Greco, in a black sweater and beret, to Britney Spears, in gingham and pigtails, to Mia Farrow, as the hapless naif of ''Rosemary's Baby.''</p>

        <p>Now, Blythe is having her moment as a fashion star. From May 31 through June 9, life-size Blythe mannequins will appear in Bloomingdale's Lexington Avenue windows. And on June 5, Blythe will be honored at a book party fund-raiser for AIDS research at Aubette organized by Chronicle Books; Spin Cycle, a New York public relations firm; and Life Beat, a music industry group.</p>
