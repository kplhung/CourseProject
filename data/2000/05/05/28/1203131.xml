        <p>Forgive Michael Lanham, but the idea that anyone would take eight decades to progress from fifth grade to doctorate is unimaginable.</p>
        <p>Growing up on a cattle and tobacco farm in Gravel Switch, Ky., population about 100, Mr. Lanham finished kindergarten, first and second grades in one year, all before he turned 6. He skipped ninth grade and graduated from high school at 14.</p>
        <p>Though it did not hurt that Mr. Lanham's mother, Jan, was the coordinator of the gifted students program for the Marion County school system -- ''She oversaw the accelerations,'' he says -- his mind was clearly racing faster than his peers'. He began reading when he was 2, his family says, was able to do simple math by the time he was 5, and had mastered high school geometry, English and French by age 10.</p>
        <p>Today, at 18, he is to graduate from Centre College, a liberal arts institution of about 1,100 students in Danville, about 65  miles southeast of Louisville. In the fall, he will begin studying at Oxford on a Rhodes scholarship, among the youngest recipients of the scholarship in at least two decades.</p>
        <p>''For as long as I can remember, it's just been the person I've been,'' Mr. Lanham said. ''Because I skipped grades so young, I've been used to being with people who are three years older. My family has played a large role in keeping me down to earth and realizing that there is always more I can be doing -- and that I don't need to coast on my reputation.''</p>
        <p>The fall after he finished high school, Mr. Lanham enrolled at Centre College. His baby-soft face had yet to sprout a whisker. But at well over 6 feet, he fit in.</p>
        <p>''My first day on campus,'' he said, ''a girl who I've since become friends with came up to me and said, 'Do you know there's a 15-year-old on campus?'</p>
        <p>''I said, 'Yes. It's me.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lanham found dorm life easy, having attended several sleep-away camps and study programs, and was never especially tempted to indulge in alcohol. He also dated several older girls, but they have usually been from his hometown and were still in high school.</p>
        <p>Because of his height -- he now stands 6 feet 9 inches tall -- Mr. Lanham seemed destined for the basketball team. But it was not to be.</p>
        <p>''I prefer dancing as a physical activity to any sport,'' he said. ''I enjoy the dancing part of the musicals I've been in.'' They include ''Cabaret,'' in which he was in the chorus, and ''A Little Night Music,'' for which he oversaw all musical direction.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lanham, to no one's surprise, concentrated on multiple disciplines in the classroom. He took enough pre-medical courses to apply to medical school, as well as a double major in music and mathematics. At Oxford he intends to study mathematical biology, which tries to create models to explain and predict the way diseases spread or populations grow.</p>
        <p>He imagines growing up to be a scientist, or a conductor, or maybe both.</p>
        <p>''I don't really feel I push myself to do any more than I am able to do,'' he said. ''I've tried to do the best in everything I apply myself towards.''</p>
        <p>Lest Mr. Lanham appear superhuman, consider the denouement of a long-scheduled telephone interview with him. In an audible panic, he suddenly realized that he had forgotten to charge the battery on his cordless phone, the only phone in his dorm room. Seconds later, before he could even finish asking a reporter for his number, the phone was dead.</p>
        <p>Reached at home several days later, his father, Kevin, laughed. ''He's just as typical as any 18-year-old,'' the father said. ''He's very mature, but he messes up, just as we all do, from time to time.''</p>
