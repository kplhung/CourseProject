        <p>Tulip Fever</p>
        <p>By Deborah Moggach.</p>
        <p>Delacorte, $21.95.</p>
        <p>''How stolid we look,'' thinks the Dutch painter Jan van Loos halfway through Deborah Moggach's new novel, ''but underneath we are all gamblers. We are a people possessed.'' Moggach's sumptuous prose creates an impression of serenity that belies the passions just beneath the surface of Amsterdam in the 1630's, where the tulip market is reaching record highs. In sentences that are as rich and concentrated as oil pigments, Moggach introduces us to the elderly Cornelis Sandvoort; his beautiful young bride, Sophia, into whom his dreams are assembled ''like flower petals packed into a bud''; her lover, Jan, who is hired to paint the Sandvoorts' portrait; and Sophia's maid, Maria. As ''Tulip Fever'' unfolds, Sophia's tentative romance with Jan gradually becomes so reckless that it is analogous to Amsterdam's obsession with tulips. Made ruthless by love, the couple plan to escape the city. In the end, they develop a vision of themselves that is as single-minded and destructive as that of the tulip speculator whose wife says to him, ''You'd dig in your children if you thought it would improve the soil.'' Moggach's book reads like a thriller: it's a novel that ponders what it means to push things too far, and keenly examines what the consequences might be.</p>
