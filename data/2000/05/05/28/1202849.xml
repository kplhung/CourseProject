        <p>AT the intersection of Sturgis Road and Locust Lane, on the Bronxville-Mount Vernon border, a half-dozen mailboxes are stacked together, as they might be at the end of an unpaved road. But this is a dense suburb, not RFD country. So why would homeowners choose to walk to the corner to get their bills and magazines rather than accept delivery at home?</p>
        <p>The answer is the lure of the Bronxville address, with all its tony connotations: the Reformed Church, the Women's Club, the village paddle ball courts, the Girl Scout cabin, the ladies lunching in their Hermes scarves. And even on the ''wrong'' side of the Bronxville border, whether in Mount Vernon, Tuckahoe or Yonkers, a chosen few get the coveted 10708 zip code for a fraction of the price.</p>
        <p>Ask these people where they live and the answer is ''Bronxville P.O.'' or ''Bronxville Vicinity,'' a form of real estate-speak that has a California counterpart. In Los Angeles, where addresses carry the status they do here, there are separate real estate listings for ''Beverly Hills,'' ''Beverly Hills P.O.'' and ''Beverly Hills Adjacent,'' which could mean the edges of West Hollywood or Century City, both worlds apart from 90210.</p>
        <p>Here, each tier has its pluses and minuses. At the apex is ''Bronxville Village.'' It is a square-mile hamlet, 28 minutes from Manhattan, with 6,000 self-satisfied residents, the luckiest living in eight-  or nine-bedroom homes with ballrooms or gymnasiums in the turn-of-the-century Hilltop area or in Louis Bowman's stone Tudors with their imposing chimneys and low-hanging slate roofs.</p>
        <p>It is a rare house in Bronxville that sells for less than $1.5 million, unless it's one of the tasteless split-levels and raised ranches that were shoehorned into a few available lots in the 1950's. The school system, although tiny, boasts even higher test scores than vaunted Scarsdale or Chappaqua. Taxes average a whopping $20,000 a year.</p>
        <p>Those with preschoolers or children who are grown can get all Bronxville has to offer for a much smaller price tag. Houses outside the village border, even grand pillared mansions on huge plots of land, sell for at least 10 percent less, with taxes hovering at $10,000. The result is a migration across a permeable border. Many, with babies, buy in one of the estate areas of Yonkers. They move for the school years. Then back again when the nest is empty.</p>
        <p>And for some families, Bronxville schools are beside the point. They live in certain Yonkers neighborhoods, send their children to private school at Hackley or Horace Mann, shop, dine and socialize just blocks away in Bronxville Village and come out even -- or ahead of the game. ''That kind of arithmetic is not rare,'' said Liz Lindsey, manager of the Houlihan/Lawrence real estate office here.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lindsey lives in Mount Vernon, with no fancy zip code. She once owned a real estate agency in the most prosperous corner of that struggling city. In Fleetwood, as the area is known, a couple of houses are blessed with a 10708 address, boosting their value. Ms. Lindsey also used to be a dean at Sarah Lawrence College, where officials have been known to argue, disingenuously, that they are in Bronxville, not Yonkers.</p>
        <p>For a while, a court order to desegregate the schools and housing in Yonkers and the resulting tumult made owning a home there, regardless of neighborhood, a risky business. Some buyers jumped into that failing  real estate market and rode it to riches, restoring grand Colonials and Tudors in Cedar Knolls or Lawrence Park West, the epicenter of ''Bronxville P.O.'' Others preferred the insurance policy of a home in Bronxville proper, where value never seems to go down.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lindsey and Laura Stichter-Bryson, a lifelong Bronxville resident and a top seller at Houlihan/Lawrence, see no reason why the Cedar Knolls or Lawrence Park West residents should feel any need to confess that they live in Yonkers.</p>
        <p>''When people think Yonkers, they think downtown Getty Square,'' Ms. Stichter-Bryson said, with a sniff for the rundown commercial and government hub of the state's fourth-largest city. ''They wouldn't even consider going to downtown Yonkers.</p>
        <p>''They buy their groceries here; they buy their children's clothes here,'' she said, edging a used black Jaguar past the quaint shops on Pondfield Road. ''You see them every Sunday at the Reformed Church. They have no association whatsoever with Yonkers, not socially or in any other way, shape or form.''</p>
