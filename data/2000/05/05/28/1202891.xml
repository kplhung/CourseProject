        <p>Architect Kevin M Smith letter questions Herbert Muschamp's belief, in May 14 article, that New York City real estate interests and officials revised zoning law in fear that power is shifting to 'cultural plane'</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Can Mr. Muschamp honestly believe that the city's real estate interests and officialdom concocted this revision to the zoning law in response to a fear that power in New York is shifting to the ''cultural plane''? I would hope that one of the more public-spirited developers will invite him to sit in on a project meeting so that he can view firsthand what scant influence the self-referential world of academic architecture has on building in New York, or, for that matter, anywhere in the country.</p>
        <p>Nearly 40 years since the 1961 zoning resolution was crafted to make New York safe for Modernism, perhaps half a dozen buildings of real architectural quality have benefited from its provisions. Countless others have cluttered the skyline and streetscape with cheap imitations of Corbusian models. A change in the resolution has long been overdue.</p>

        <p>Can Mr. Muschamp honestly believe that the city's real estate interests and officialdom concocted this revision to the zoning law in response to a fear that power in New York is shifting to the ''cultural plane''?

        <p>Nearly 40 years since the 1961 zoning resolution was crafted to make New York safe for Modernism, perhaps half a dozen buildings of real architectural quality have benefited from its provisions. Countless others have cluttered the skyline and streetscape with cheap imitations of Corbusian models. A change in the resolution has long been overdue.</p>
        <p>The purpose of zoning is to regulate the 99.9 percent of building which must relate to the city as a whole and which is, for good or for ill, driven primarily by economic and functional forces. All the Frank Gehrys of the world in fact rely aesthetically on background buildings to play off their experimental forms. Citizens and architects need to care about these background buildings as well as the monuments. Unfortunately, since too many architects and architectural writers seem only to be concerned with the five buildings per year that stretch the boundaries of formal language, it must fall to others to shape the development of our cities.</p>
