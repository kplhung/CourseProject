        <p>AS part of his score for Jennifer Muller's bittersweet new performance piece, ''Asolo,'' Marty Beller stands onstage behind a long wooden table and rips lettuce, bangs on a curious assortment of pots and pans and even taps his fingers impatiently on the tabletop. It sets a humorous mood, but that lasts only until the dancer Leonardo Smith begins to speak.</p>
        <p>''So, I couldn't sleep last night,'' begins Mr. Smith, one of three dancers who will perform the piece at the Joyce Theater from Tuesday through next Sunday. ''Not that that's unusual, but there I was. . . . Not sleeping is not the exhausting part; the exhausting part is worrying that you're not sleeping.''</p>
        <p>In many ways, those words sum up the anguish and, yes, sleepless nights that Ms. Muller has experienced in the 25 years since she formed her company, the Works, which now numbers nine dancers and two apprentices. ''I always say there are brownie points for continuing this long,'' Ms. Muller, 55, said with a smile during a recent interview at her Chelsea studio. ''Sometimes it feels short, and other times it feels like 80 years. But dance is my passion. I can't conceive of not doing this, and at the same time it's a daily choice because it's such a hard life. Being a choreographer is a struggle, but when I get into the studio, it's a present. I think dance is one of the most glorious things to be involved with. But you pay the price.''</p>
        <p>For her season at the Joyce Ms. Muller has choreographed five premieres that highlight her sensual, often virtuosic style. Along with two works with dialogue, ''Asolo'' and ''Time Treading,'' she has created ''Beethoven: Not Four Naught,'' a wry tribute to her days as a Juilliard student; ''Hymn for Her,'' a lush duet that features intricate lifts and partnering between Yumiko Yoshikawa and Anton Wilson, and ''Spores, Solitude and Summer Humming,'' a robust company work set to music by Bobby McFerrin in his collaborations with Yo-Yo Ma and Chick Corea.</p>
        <p>The two pieces with text, ''Asolo'' and ''Time Treading,'' also include commissioned scores, for Ms. Muller believes that dialogue works best when paired with live music. While Mr. Beller's percussive arrangement lends ''Asolo'' its primitive flavor, Lawrence Nachsin uses a synthesizer to create a pulsating, modern score for ''Time Treading.''</p>
        <p>In ''Asolo,'' which is far less physical than Ms. Muller's other works, Mr. Smith crashes to the floor and leaps in the air with abandon but always returns to the same spot in the middle of the stage to stare pointedly at the audience as he speaks. The effect is both unnerving and riveting.</p>
        <p>''Each time I return to dialogue, I do try to use it in different ways,'' Ms. Muller said. ''Lately, I found that the dancing and the talking were separated. For 'Asolo,' I really wanted to make the language stream-of-consciousness and have it inform the structure of the piece. The movement came out of what the words were saying as opposed to the words being pasted onto the dance.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Beller, who has worked with Ms. Muller on four previous pieces, the partnership is a rich one. ''Jennifer makes me a far better composer and performer,'' he says. ''The best part is that what we come up with is new, and not at all what I would create on my own.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Muller discovered her dramatic side early, with the help of her mother, Lynette, who worked as a director in community theater in Yonkers and enrolled her daughter in dance classes when she was 3. Ms. Muller went on to study dance at Juilliard, joined the Pearl Lang Dance Company at 15 and two years later, in 1963, became a member of the Jose Limon Dance Company, where she was a principal dancer for nine years. ''I learned about passion and commitment from Jose,'' she recalls. ''I was very lucky. I partnered him in 'The Moor's Pavane.' When he was the Moor, you thought he was going to throttle you! It was over the top. But that kind of all-consuming conviction and passion was a big lesson.''</p>
        <p>Although Ms. Muller is vivacious now, she grew up painfully shy. Looking back on her long career, she says, she sees that dance, which served as a form of language dating to her childhood, is still her main voice. ''It has been an amazing teacher for me,'' she says. ''I learned how to deal with my body and emotions onstage. I've taught myself how to live a life through it. How to be out in the world through dance.''</p>
