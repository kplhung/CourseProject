        <p>New York Knickerbockers center Patrick Ewing is unable to play in game 3 of the Eastern Conference Finals against Indiana Pacers because of pain in his right foot caused by acute peroneal tendinitis; photo (S)</p>

        <p>Before the start of the game, before the crowd had begun to filter into Madison Square Garden, Patrick Ewing put his warm-ups on and had the trainers tape him as if it were any other day. It was almost as if Ewing believed that if he treated it like a normal day, it would be, and he would be able to play.</p>
        <p>But when he tried to run, testing his right foot that was suffering from acute peroneal tendinitis, it took him just seconds to realize that the pain would not allow him to play. So he put his gray suit back on and took a seat on the bench, serving as a cheerleader throughout the Knicks' 98-95 victory over the Indiana Pacers in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals. ''I came with the intention to try to play,'' Ewing said. ''That's what I did, but I just couldn't do it.''</p>

        <p>Before the start of the game, before the crowd had begun to filter into Madison Square Garden, Patrick Ewing put his warm-ups on and had the trainers tape him as if it were any other day. It was almost as if Ewing believed that if he treated it like a normal day, it would be, and he would be able to play.</p>
        <p>But when he tried to run, testing his right foot that was suffering from acute peroneal tendinitis, it took him just seconds to realize that the pain would not allow him to play. So he put his gray suit back on and took a seat on the bench, serving as a cheerleader throughout the Knicks' 98-95 victory over the Indiana Pacers in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals. ''I came with the intention to try to play,'' Ewing said. ''That's what I did, but I just couldn't do it.''</p>
        <p>Ewing, who played just seven minutes in Game 2, remained confident that he would return to action in this series, whether it is tomorrow in Game 4 or Wednesday in Game 5.</p>
        <p>''That's one of the reasons I didn't go today, to give my leg, my ankle, my foot -- whatever it is -- give it a couple of extra days to rest,'' he said. ''It's improved. It wasn't as bad as when I first did it. I'm able to walk a little better on it.''</p>
        <p>With yesterday's victory, the Knicks assured that there will be a Game 5 for Ewing to return to, and for that, he was thankful. ''I thought that the whole team came up big for us,'' Ewing said. ''Spree played a fantastic game. I think every man who played did something, even the guys who didn't play.''</p>
        <p>Gutting It Out</p>
        <p>While Patrick Ewing was testing his foot, Larry Johnson was having his own problems. Believing yesterday's game was a night game, he had not taken the back medication that he usually takes before the game.</p>
        <p>''Usually I take my medicine at shoot-around,'' Johnson said. ''I forgot to do that, and the game was at 3:30. I came in and felt a little stiffness. We stretched it out and went on and played the game. Once I got here at 12 o'clock, I took it, but I didn't know when it was going to kick in. I still felt sore.''</p>
        <p>But Johnson played with even more dexterity than usual. He had 14 points on 6-of-11 shooting.</p>
        <p>An Unsung Hero</p>
        <p>The box score was not kind to Chris Dudley yesterday, showing not a single field goal attempt and just four rebounds. But Dudley was in the starting lineup and played 25 minutes, just one minute shy of his season high for a game and more than he had totaled in every game combined since March 8.</p>
        <p>Dudley was able to slow Rik Smits in the second half, and even convert a pair of free throws in the third quarter that tied the score at 47-47, and the Knicks never trailed again.</p>
        <p>''You never know what can happen,'' Dudley said. ''Last year I was in the rotation already, so it was a little different, but it was kind of deja vu when Pat went down and I started the rest of the games in the finals last year. This was a little different in that I hadn't been playing at all. I felt like I owed it to my teammates and to myself to be ready.''</p>
        <p>Jeff Van Gundy, who notified him of his starting assignment shortly before tip-off, said: ''I am very proud of a guy like Chris Dudley. You look at the box score and there is nothing spectacular. He has got a bad back, a bad knee, been sitting over there a long time and could have easily taken the rest of the season off because of his injuries. He just went out and played so, so hard.''</p>
