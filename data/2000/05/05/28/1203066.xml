        <p>A DECADE or so ago, Dennis N. T. Perkins, president of the Syncretics Group in Branford, Conn., brought us ''the moose on the table,'' the disarming metaphor that companies use to mention the unmentionable. He devised that impish but effective image as a way of coaxing business people into talking openly about the sensitive issues that hang heavy over a discussion but that no one dares mention.</p>
        <p>Now Dr. Perkins, a management consultant whose clients include American Express, Bose, Citibank and Marriott, is back with bigger game in mind. He is a connoisseur of leadership in circumstances of great peril. His new book offers lessons in leadership ''at the outer limits of human endurance -- the place I call The Edge.''</p>
        <p>This thoughtful work has the feel of a lifelong obsession. An Annapolis graduate, Dr. Perkins woke up to genuine leadership in Vietnam, a brutal and unforgettable academy.  At one point he found himself in command of a Marine convoy running a bloody gantlet along Route 1 from Chu Lai to Da Nang. Caught in a withering ambush, shaken and confused, he urged his column forward, concluding that the risk of crossing an open field of fire was better than sitting tight in the bull's-eye of the killing zone. (''A man sits as many risks as he runs,'' Dr. Perkins quotes Henry David Thoreau.)</p>
        <p>Dr. Perkins builds his corporate leadership text around the astonishing story of the British Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, led by Sir Ernest Shackleton. In December 1914, Shackleton and 27 others sailed from South Georgia, an island in the Southern Ocean, bent on becoming the first to cross Antarctica on foot, a trek expected to take three months.</p>
        <p>Instead, Shackleton and his troop endured more than 600 wretched days of endless cold, near-starvation, scanty shelter, misery and despair before they struggled back to South Georgia. Their ship became icebound and was eventually crushed.</p>
        <p>For months, the party clung to an ice floe, but as the floe melted, the desperate men took to the frigid sea in open boats. They found a toehold on a small island, but that proved untenable, so Shackleton and five others struck out in a lifeboat for help 800 miles away across the world's most storm-swept seas. Barely surviving that ordeal, they then clawed their way across New Georgia's icy mountain ranges to safety.</p>
        <p>Dr. Perkins offers us Ernest Shackleton as the model leader, a captain obsessed with the welfare of his men. Cautious or daring as circumstances required, Shackleton was a rock. An inventive and insistent cheerleader, he refused to let the enfeebled company give up. He insisted on maintaining equity and mutual respect, and he saved the most onerous tasks for himself. Incredibly, not a man died.</p>
        <p>So far, so good, but what does all this have to do with meeting a payroll?</p>
        <p>Dr. Perkins has distilled 10 principles from these survival experiences, and he offers them as a guide for business leadership at the edge (though it's never entirely clear what, in business, ''the edge'' means). The 10 principles, the backbone of the book, are expounded in the Shackleton saga. Taken out of that adventurous context, they seem mostly unexceptionable, if not routine.</p>
        <p>''Never lose sight of the ultimate goal, and focus energy on short-term objectives.'' ''Set a personal example with visible, memorable symbols and behaviors.'' ''Minimize status differences.'' ''Find something to celebrate and something to laugh about.'' ''Reinforce the team message constantly: 'We are one -- we live or die together.' ''</p>
        <p>''Leading at the Edge'' reads like two different accounts -- a gripping adventure story and an orthodox management manual -- that never really marry. To stitch the two together, each chapter on the Shackleton expedition concludes with questions and some ''lessons for leaders.'' The lessons tend to be shopworn episodes from management lore, like Andy Grove's pivotal decision to get Intel out of memory chips or James Burke's handling of Johnson &amp; Johnson's Tylenol tampering scare or Scott McNealy's resourcefulness at Sun Microsystems.</p>
        <p>Dr. Perkins does include four business cases where he applies his principles in detail. Abstract and dry, lacking pertinent detail, the case studies cannot measure up to the survival saga. They tend to depict executives who obtained outstanding results by greatly improving communications with the rank and file. Jack Creighton revived Weyerhauser from mediocrity. Pat Russo led a turnaround at AT&amp;T's Global Business Communications Systems. These executives' efforts, as impressive as they were, pale in comparison to Shackleton's: Ms. Russo gave subordinates her home telephone number. Shackleton led a terrifying sail across polar seas.</p>
        <p>The only case that comes to life involved loyalty and devotion. It is the tale of Aaron Feuerstein's rebuilding of Malden Mills after its disastrous fire in December 1995. At 70, his life work consumed in flames, Mr. Feuerstein could have pocketed the insurance proceeds and retired. Instead, he vowed to rebuild his mill and save his employees' livelihoods.  Struggling against enormous odds, Mr. Feuerstein and his loyal workers managed to get Malden's Polartek lines back in production within months.</p>
        <p>Why do the two halves seem so out of kilter? In truth, precious few business decisions are made ''at the edge,'' with life or limb in peril. Dr. Perkins argues that ''the edge'' of endurance can be subjective. ''I've seen people more upset about missing deadlines or giving presentations than Marines under automatic-weapon and mortar fire.'' But we all know that business teams do not ''live or die together.'' It is romantic (or foolish) to frame the stakes that way.</p>
        <p>When a business fails, it is dismantled or reorganized; people lose jobs but most find other ones. Failure is a cleansing of the economy. If a chief executive falls short, typically he or she is given a comfortable departure, and a new aspirant comes in to tackle the job. Business problems are serious but not lethal.</p>
        <p>One wonders how the valiant Shackleton would fare in today's business world. In his circumstance, the ultimate goal -- survival -- was indisputable. In today's bewildering environment, reaching agreement on fundamental goals may be half the battle. And though Shackleton's people might grumble or bicker, they were hardly free to listen to a headhunter and depart for a more promising enterprise.</p>
        <p>SHACKLETON is the leader as father figure, a heroic provider who shouldered the weight and made the decisions. He had loyal lieutenants but not equals. He listened to others but chose the path himself. Today's business leader is less a hero than a first among equals, an enabler who inspires commitment and exists to bring out the best in his or her people. The talent is unwilling to rely so heavily on someone else.</p>
        <p>''Leading at the Edge'' has a wistful air. The lessons are shaped for warriors and adventurers but directed at managers, who are neither. At some level Dr. Perkins is looking for the ideal company commander. Only in the recounting of miraculous survival does the writing come alive -- not only the tale of the Shackleton expedition, but also of Steven Callahan, who, with indomitable ingenuity, survived 76 days in a five-foot rubber raft in the Atlantic, warding off sharks and spearing fish for food. Or the Navy patrol plane that crashed in the North Pacific, consigning the crew to two small life rafts. (Five of 15 died, but the survivors buoyed their spirits by chanting, ''Toga, toga, toga,'' after John Belushi in ''Animal House.'') Or the Texan who, bitten by a coral snake, bit off the snake's head and used the snake's skin for a tourniquet.</p>
