        <p>Music school did not equip her for engineering, but Laura Calzolari is talking steel studs and floating floors like a pro.</p>
        <p>Ms. Calzolari, executive director of the Music Conservatory of Westchester in White Plains, studies plans for the conservatory's new building as avidly as she once scrutinized flute scores.</p>
        <p>''Music school construction is very complicated,'' she said of the makeover being given to the onetime Motor Vehicle Bureau on Central Avenue in White Plains. ''You have the issue not only of sound balance within a room but sound isolation from room to room.''</p>
        <p>The $4 million renovation project is scheduled for completion by December. The school will have 42 new teaching and practice studios as well as spaces for rent. These include a 175-seat recital hall, with an adjacent green room and flexible seating, and a 20-by-30-foot rehearsal studio suitable for a small orchestra or large chorus, equipped with a recording studio.</p>
        <p>Construction has been under way for a month, and Ms. Calzolari has been promised a firm opening date: Jan. 6, 2001.</p>
        <p>''We've been at capacity for several years and weren't able to grow this year,'' she said of the 70-year-old conservatory, which has been in its present building on Soundview Avenue since 1979. The school serves 2,500 students, both on site and in outreach programs.</p>
