        <p>Wildwood tourists may be forgiven if they feel they are in advertising overload this summer -- from the planes overhead with ads flapping down to the beach itself, which will now double as a billboard.</p>
        <p>The Beach-n Billboard Company, which calls itself an environmentally safe advertising operation, has been given a contract to imprint the Wildwood beaches with advertising logos, the only town in the state to allow it.</p>
        <p>The ads will be pressed into the sand by rollers attached to the raking equipment that goes over the beach every morning. The logos will appear in a continual strip about five feet wide, Mayor Duane Sloan said.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mayor Sloan said he voted against the contract because he thought it would detract from an image of the town that he felt was improving, but was outvoted by his colleagues on the city commission, 2 to 1.</p>
        <p>So far, Kozy Shack Pudding and Snapple have signed up as advertisers. The machine will also impress ''Please Don't Litter'' messages.</p>
        <p>No paint or paper will be used. And because the logos will disappear thanks to the wind, the surf and the thousands of footsteps each day, there will be no need for cleaning up.</p>
        <p>Under the contract, Wildwood will be paid $20,000, and more if additional advertisers sign up. Mayor Sloan said the money would go toward defraying the $800,000-a-year cost of maintaining the beach, one of the last in the state not to charge a fee.</p>
