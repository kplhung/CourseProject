        <p>The Memorial Tournament is not supposed to end until Sunday, but Tiger Woods tried to end the suspense today.</p>
        <p>Some race cars at the Indianapolis 500 will not start as quickly as Woods did. After eight holes, Woods already had an eagle and four birdies. He was in a zone of his own, pulling away from the field and pulling off shots that even his playing partners were forced to admire.</p>
        <p>When it was over, Woods held a six-stroke lead, and it appeared he already had one hand on the championship trophy. Shooting a seven-under-par 65, Woods stood at 17 under par for the tournament (71-63-65, 199), six strokes ahead of Steve Lowery and seven strokes ahead of Justin Leonard after today's third round at Muirfield Village Golf Club.</p>
        <p>Woods has the biggest third-round lead on the PGA Tour since March 1998, when David Duval led by six strokes after the third round of the Tucson Chrysler Classic. And it was the biggest lead of Woods's career since the 1997 Masters, when he led by nine strokes after three rounds.</p>
        <p>So the question was this: Will the rest of the field be playing for second place Sunday? The answers varied.</p>
        <p>''You can think we're playing for second, but I don't think we as players can,'' said Leonard, who had a hole-in-one today at No. 8, using a 5-iron from 171 yards.</p>
        <p>''You spot the No. 1 player seven shots for 18 holes, I'd have to bet on Tiger,'' Lowery said.</p>
        <p>''What do you want me to say?'' asked Ernie Els, who fell out of contention with a 72, leaving him seven under. ''It's over.''</p>
        <p>What was Woods's reaction?</p>
        <p>''Well, I don't think it's over,'' said Woods, who will be trying to win for the fourth time this year. ''I've got 18 holes left. If it's over, I'd be talking with a trophy right here, right?''</p>
        <p>Woods did not have the trophy -- yet. But after winning the Memorial last year, he appeared to be on the verge of repeating as a tournament champion for the first time in his professional career.</p>
        <p>There was little question that he was in command, taking advantage of greens softened by morning rain, plus lift-clean-and-place rules that allowed players to place their ball in the fairway.</p>
        <p>The bigger question after Woods's blistering start concerned whether he would shoot 59. After making par on the first two holes, Woods made a a 12-foot putt for birdie at No. 3, followed by a 10-footer for birdie at No. 4. Then at the par-5, 527-yard No. 5, Woods made another birdie when he reached the green in two shots and two-putted from 40 feet.</p>
        <p>After a par at No. 6, Woods eagled the par-5 No. 7, hitting a huge drive and then a terrific 3-iron shot from 233 yards that landed on the green and ran toward the hole, stopping 15 feet past it. Woods converted the putt, followed by another birdie at the par-3, 182-yard No. 8, where he hit a radar-like 7-iron tee shot that landed a foot from the hole.</p>
        <p>At that point, Woods was six under par through eight holes. Going back to Friday, he was 15 under par over his last 22 holes. Woods settled for par at Nos. 9 and 10; his 10-foot putt for birdie at No. 9 stopped just short of the hole, and Woods angrily waved his putter. He insisted, however, that he had not thought of shooting 59.</p>
        <p>''If you're nine under through 14 or 15 holes, it's more feasible,'' Woods said. ''But these finishing holes are playing straight into the wind.''</p>
        <p>Woods made another eagle at No. 11 and birdied No. 15 before making his first bogey at No. 18, ending a streak of 48 holes without a bogey.</p>
        <p>Els and Harrison Frazar, who fell out of contention with a 78, seemed distracted by Woods's early barrage. Frazar admitted that he marveled at Woods's approach shot at No. 11, a 5-iron from around 220 yards that landed 8 feet from the pin.</p>
        <p>''He hit it straight up in the air, and it carried all the way to the flag,'' Frazar said. ''I don't know any other players out here who have that shot. I had not played with him for a long time. Now I know why.''</p>
        <p>With rounds of 63 and 65 the past two days, it is safe to say that Woods's experiment with the Nike ball is going quite well. He used the Nike ball in competition for the first time last week in Germany, where he finished third after leading by three strokes heading into the final round.</p>
        <p>For him to lose a six-stroke lead would be shocking. Leonard was not willing to concede, but he was also not surprised that Woods was so far ahead.</p>
        <p>''The amazement has kind of gone away,'' Leonard said. ''A week like this on a golf course that suits him well, you almost come to expect it.''</p>
