        <p>A DOCTOR refuses a treatment for a sick child. State medical officials later find the treatment should have been provided, and that the doctor blundered. Should the doctor escape punishment because he works as a medical director for an H.M.O. or other managed care company?</p>
        <p>That is the question before a federal court in Dallas in a lawsuit pitting one of the nation's largest health insurance providers, UnitedHealthcare, against Texas officials who have proposed disciplining one of the company's medical directors, the influential behind-the-scenes officials who decide whether to pay for patient treatments.</p>
        <p>The outcome could have important consequences: If the state prevails in court and this kind of disciplinary action spreads, one of the basic premises of managed care -- that insurers can contain costs by wielding an effective veto over frontline doctors' treatment decisions -- could be hampered by state medical boards third-guessing the insurers' second-guessing. A decision in favor of UnitedHealthcare, on the other hand, could deflect growing efforts by many state boards to hold H.M.O.'s accountable for treatment decisions, physician groups say.</p>
        <p>The Texas case stems from a UnitedHealthcare medical director's decision two years ago not to approve coverage of at-home skilled nursing care for a 13-year-old boy, David Wiser, who had spent five weeks hospitalized after suffering respiratory failure. The boy's doctor called the treatment ''medically necessary,'' but the medical director said it was ''custodial care'' and not covered by the insurance plan. In January, officials at the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners found that by denying coverage the medical director failed to provide proper care.</p>
        <p>The facts of the case are not novel, but one question it raises is: Does a 26-year-old federal pension law, which managed care companies frequently use to beat down lawsuits by patients, also shield their medical decision-makers from state regulation? A dozen states have recently approved rules requiring H.M.O. medical directors to be physicians licensed in the state where their health plan resides, and thus subject to oversight by state medical boards; nine more require them to be licensed, but not necessarily in that state.</p>
        <p>The issue goes to the heart of the debate in Congress over whether injured patients should be able to take legal action against health maintenance organizations and other managed care companies that improperly deny care. The industry has long used provisions of the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, known as Erisa, to fight off patient lawsuits; the 1974 law limits state-court actions against benefit plans, including claims for wrongful death or injury. Federal courts lately have chipped away at Erisa's shield, but UnitedHealthcare contends in the Dallas case that the law nonetheless bars state officials from taking action against medical directors and other employees who approve or deny coverage of treatments.</p>
        <p>The case also highlights another important question in the patients' rights debate: What it is, exactly, that H.M.O.'s and other managed care companies are doing when they deny treatment -- are they making a simple administrative decision about benefits, or are they, as physicians' groups contend, effectively practicing medicine, substituting their own judgment for that of the attending doctor?</p>
        <p>''The physicians who direct treatment need to be accountable to the public for their conduct,'' said Dr. James Winn, executive vice president of the Federation of State Medical Boards, in Euless, Tex. ''Doctors shouldn't be able to claim a safe harbor simply because they work for an insurance company. I expect to see more and more litigation coming as a result of this issue.''</p>
        <p>The industry and its crusade to rein in health care costs are already beset by lawsuits and legislative threats from all directions. On top of proposals in Congress and the states' efforts, a wave of class-action lawsuits has been filed against managed care plans, based on claims that the plans have systematically defrauded and shortchanged patients by limiting care. The California Medical Association opened a new front last week when it filed a civil racketeering suit against three managed-care companies, accusing them of ''using coercive, unfair and fraudulent means to dominate and control the physician-patient relationship for their own financial gain.'' An industry spokesman called the suit a groundless ''shotgun attack on managed care.''</p>
        <p>As pressures on the industry have grown, some companies have eased up. UnitedHealthcare, a unit of UnitedHealth Group based in Minneapolis, announced in November that it has given up most second-guessing of medical-necessity decisions made by patients' doctors, though they will still reject procedures that they determine are not covered by individual health plans.</p>
        <p>But in the Dallas case, Louis Saccoccio, general counsel of the American Association of Health Plans, said state officials are trying to second-guess a benefit-coverage call, something they have no authority to do. ''The board of medical examiners is getting involved in what is basically a benefit or coverage determination,'' he said. ''It's a concern for health plans and it would be a concern for medical directors, and it would be a concern for employers and consumers.''</p>
        <p>Jay Silverstein, UnitedHealthcare's chief marketing officer, said, ''The fundamental issue is that our medical director was making a benefit decision on behalf of an employer,'' he said. ''It was never a question of medical necessity.''</p>
        <p>One thing is certain: This is not an H.M.O. ''horror story,'' with a victim who allegedly never got proper treatment and a plaintiffs' lawyer dragging a deep-pocketed insurer before a jury. In fact, David Wiser's home care bills wound up being paid by another arm of UnitedHealthcare, and while the boy died a few months after leaving the hospital, no one has alleged that his death was related to the treatments at the center of the dispute. His parents, Mark and Sherrel Wiser, do not stand to gain monetarily from the outcome. They decided to pursue the matter, Mr. Wiser said, because of how shaken they were when UnitedHealthcare initially declined coverage; they say they hope to spare other parents the ordeal they went through.</p>
        <p>On the morning of April 27, 1998, Mr. Wiser was taking David to school as usual when the boy, who was paralyzed, suffered from scoliosis, and had a long history of respiratory and other serious illnesses, became lethargic and his breathing grew labored.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wiser rushed his son to Cook Children's Medical Center in Fort Worth, a half-hour away. David suffered respiratory failure there and was put on a ventilator. He remained in the hospital for five weeks, much of the time in intensive care, as doctors weaned him off round-the-clock ventilator care to the point where he could breathe on his own much of the day.</p>
        <p>By June, David's physician, Dr. Sami K. W. Hadeed, a pediatric pulmonologist, was prepared to discharge him. But Dr. Hadeed wanted David to use a ventilator at home and be looked after by home care nurses. Dr. Hadeed wrote: ''Although David will be going home with mechanical ventilatory support at night, it is hoped that he will be able to do some additional vent weaning in the future and may, in fact, be able to come entirely off the ventilator again at some point.''</p>
        <p>The family's primary health insurance was Ms. Wiser's coverage under her employer's self-funded plan administered by UnitedHealthcare's Dallas office. But one of the three Dallas medical directors at UnitedHealthcare balked at paying for the skilled nursing treatment Dr. Hadeed ordered.</p>
        <p>According to docments drawn up by the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners as part of a proposed settlement of the case, the medical director based his decision on a 15- to 20-minute telephone conversation with Dr. Hadeed, plus two to three hours of discussions with other UnitedHealthcare staff members. The medical director -- who is not named in court filings but is identified in documents provided by Mr. Wiser as Dr. David William Ellis -- had no experience with home ventilator care and did not consult medical literature in making his decision, according to the document.</p>
        <p>UnitedHealthcare contends that Dr. Hadeed's treatment order was outside the scope of Ms. Wiser's insurance because it was custodial care. Rather than working ''towards resolution of a specific health problem,'' UnitedHealthcare's lawsuit against the state board states, Dr. Hadeed indicated that the treatment would supplement ''the care that would otherwise be provided by his family'' and that ''the purpose of these services appeared to be to provide respite to the parents.'' Dr. Hadeed did not return a phone call seeking comment.</p>
        <p>The Wisers also had secondary insurance: Mr. Wiser had coverage through a plan that, as it happens, was administered by UnitedHealthcare's California subsidiary. That plan agreed to pay for the at-home treatment after using an independent medical reviewer to assess David's condition, Mr. Wiser said. The reviewer concluded that ''David is very fragile medically and physically'' and authorized at least 16 hours a day of skilled nursing at home, according to a copy of the report provided by Mr. Wiser. The report continued: ''In Texas, a patient cannot be cared for by unskilled caregivers if he is not stable or predictable. David certainly falls in the unstable and unpredictable categories.''</p>
        <p>DAVID was discharged from the hospital and received the care Dr. Hadeed ordered, his father said. But David suffered problems throughout that summer, Mr. Wiser said, and in September he died from a brain aneurysm.</p>
        <p>''I have no anger toward Dr. Ellis,'' Mr. Wiser said of the medical director who refused to approve treatment. But Mr. Wiser complained to state officials anyway -- ''hopefully to see some justice done, and hopefully to prevent something similar'' from happening to others, he said. ''This is the law that's on the books in the state of Texas, and I'm simply exercising what is legally my right. They're the ones who are suing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Silverstein of UnitedHealthcare said the case record shows that his company made the proper decisions at each stage. Those calls were strictly over what was covered, not medical necessity, he said -- Ms. Wiser's plan did not cover the treatments but Mr. Wiser's did. He added that the company ''fully supports our medical director.''</p>
        <p>''One employer purchased a certain set of benefits, and another employer didn't,'' Mr. Silverstein said. ''Those decisions are part of a contract between insurers and employers, and employers and consumers.''</p>
        <p>Physicians' groups say the line between medical judgments and benefits determinations is not so easily drawn, and that insurers invoke it arbitrarily to suit themselves. Any time a managed care official ''inappropriately makes a decision, then all of a sudden it's not a medical decision, it's a coverage decision,'' complained Connie Barron, associate director of legislative affairs for the Texas Medical Association, in Austin, Tex. ''Whichever will get them out of accountability is what they will claim.''</p>
        <p>Although David's bills were ultimately paid, Mr. Wiser said he remained disturbed that the treatment had at first been denied, and he feared what would have happened had his wife's insurance plan been all they had. Then he recalled an article he had read on a plane about an Arizona case in which medical officials had slapped the wrist of a managed-care medical director after a surgeon complained that the doctor had improperly denied coverage of a patient's gallbladder surgery.</p>
        <p>THE Wisers filed a complaint with the Texas state medical board. In January, after considering the complaint for more than a year, board officials found that when Dr. Ellis disallowed David's home treatment, he was engaging in the practice of medicine and had ''failed to meet the standard of care,'' according to papers filed by UnitedHealthcare when it sued the board. To settle the matter, the board proposed that Dr. Ellis pay a $5,000 fine and accept a public reprimand and a two-year ''probated suspension'' of his medical license -- he could continue to practice but would be required to complete 12 hours of home ventilator training and meet other conditions.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ellis, who did not return a telephone call seeking comment, could have accepted the proposed settlement or appealed to a state administrative law judge. Instead, UnitedHealthcare sued the state board in March. The board's disciplinary action against Dr. Ellis is in abeyance awaiting the outcome of the suit; a hearing is scheduled in Dallas before U.S. District Court Judge Barbara M. G. Lynn next month.</p>
        <p>State actions against managed care medical directors are rare, but there have been some significant past cases, including a 1995 case in Rhode Island and the 1997 case in Arizona that caught Mr. Wiser's attention. There, the state Court of Appeals upheld the authority of the state Board of Medical Examiners to issue a ''letter of concern'' -- a mild rebuke -- to a medical director at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Arizona regarding his ''inappropriate medical decision which could have caused harm to a patient.'' The patient went ahead with the gall bladder operation that the medical director had refused to approve, and tests afterward demonstrated that the procedure had in fact been necessary. Blue Cross then paid the bill, but the patient's surgeon complained to the state board.</p>
        <p>THERE is no Texas law requiring medical directors to be state-licensed physicians; instead, the state medical board, which is appointed by the governor, issued a position statement three years ago stating that anyone making a decision ''so as to effect the diagnosis or treatment of a patient in Texas'' must possess a state license or risk criminal prosecution. According to the Federation of State Medical Boards, 16 states now explicitly require H.M.O. medical directors to be licensed physicians in the state where the health plan resides; most of those rules were enacted in the past two years, including new laws in California, North Carolina and Virginia, according to the group. Nine more states require medical directors to have valid physician's licenses, but not necessarily from that state.</p>
        <p>But similar legislation has been turned back in other states recently. In Ohio, the state attorney general concluded last year that under current law, reviews of medical necessity by health insurance providers did not amount to the practice of medicine and were beyond the disciplinary reach of the state medical board.</p>
        <p>To Texas officials, it does not matter what you call it: Making decisions that affect medical care is the practice of medicine, plain and simple. Refusing to pay for skilled nursing at home for David included ''a determination of whether the services of a health care professional are required,'' the Texas attorney general's office said in its motion to dismiss the UnitedHealthcare lawsuit against the medical board.</p>
        <p>''Nothing is more critical to the regulation of health care than the regulation of medical decision-making,'' the motion stated. ''It is for the board, not an insurance company, to decide if medical judgment was exercised by a physician and if that judgment was exercised appropriately.''</p>
