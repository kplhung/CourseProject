      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Although Andy Warhol described the Rockefeller town house as ''the original New York loft,'' the feeling I got on my first visit wasn't ''disco'' or ''happening scene.'' It was tea.</p>
        <p>A nice cup of tea.</p>
        <p>After all, Blanchette and John D. Rockefeller III, who commissioned Philip Johnson to design the house, were not swingers. ''Like his Aunt Edith, John III suffered from intermittent bouts of agoraphobia in school, a condition that worsened after marriage,'' Ron Chernow writes in ''Titan: The Life of John D. Rockefeller Sr.'' ''When he and Blanchette went into society, he occasionally submitted to dizzy spells that nearly sent him into a dead swoon.''</p>
        <p>Normally, we are guests of so and so. But on this day, the photographer, crew and myself were alone in these beautiful rooms, listening to water falling from the fountain on the terrace as it drowned the sounds of the city. The closest we came to hosts were the press attache from Christie's International Realty and the young assistant of the house's current owner (a London art dealer), who was always about, making sure we didn't bump into the art: a desk and chairs designed by Donald Judd and several Andy Warhols bolted to the walls, including a large self-portrait. Staring at Andy, we thought that perhaps his spirit, channeled through this devilishly red painting, could host our tea.</p>
        <p>The Warholian tea party: 15 minutes of hot water and a camera. Requirements for guests? Unblinking compatibility with a camera crew. Of course, most people don't have tea parties anymore because they work. Even the idle rich don't have tea. These faster days, they slide right from lunch to cocktails.</p>
        <p>''I have tea almost every afternoon, at home alone,'' demurred Blaine Trump, who brought along her mother, Jean Beard, visiting from Florida, as well as Blaine's Brownies, the sweet things she sells to raise money for God's Love We Deliver. ''If you have tea, around 5:30, you eat a lot less for dinner,'' she explained.</p>
        <p>The fashion designer John Bartlett wanted to see the house, so he accepted the invitation. And last, but not least -- in actual fact, they arrived first -- Tammy Faye Bakker and her husband, Roe Messner.</p>
        <p>Tammy Faye Bakker? Thanks to an affectionate documentary called ''The Eyes of Tammy Faye,'' to be released in July but already a sensation at Sundance, Tammy Faye Bakker, the mascara, the miracles, the melodrama is, like, the Next Big Thing. She was in town when we were pouring.</p>
        <p>Andy Warhol would have wanted her there.</p>
        <p>''Real-life flowers!'' Tammy Faye declared, admiring some white blooms in a vase. ''At home they're all silk.''</p>
        <p>Jean was in shock. Blaine was amused. John was delighted. He had seen ''The Eyes of Tammy Faye'' at an early screening.</p>
        <p>''Are you going to buy the house?'' Blaine asked John.</p>
        <p>''I wish,'' he answered.</p>
        <p>The refreshments were served both indoors and out, and the menu was nicely old-fashioned, prepared by Hank Tomashevski. Hank said that he read somewhere, probably in Vogue, that one of the best ways to keep your weight down was not to eat after 6 o'clock. We had sort of a nutritious ''high tea,'' which in England used to refer to a workingman's supper. There was almost as much chicken in our chicken salad as mayonnaise.</p>
        <p>We served Hu-Kwa tea, a fine, slightly smoky lapsang souchong from Taiwan imported by Mark T. Wendell of Concord, Mass. It was a favorite of the Rockefellers. Philip Johnson said it also was his favorite tea and had two cups before he went away.</p>
        <p>''You're not going to write about Hu-Kwa?'' exclaimed a friend whose Philadelphia family of umpteen generations introduced me to it some years before. ''Do journalists have to ruin everything? Hu-Kwa is the only secret WASPs have left!'' As Elliot H. Johnson, the current owner of Mark T. Wendell, explained during a recent phone chat, ''Hu-Kwa is like ethnic food for our customers.''</p>
        <p>Houqua was considered the most honorable of 19th-century Cantonese potentates. His silks and teas commanded the best prices in Philadelphia and Boston. In 1904, when Mark T. Wendell, a proper Harvard man known as the Bachelor of Beacon Hill, took over his family's importing business, he renamed the company's tea for Houqua. He mailed the tea, first as gifts, in chic, black tins to people he knew on Beacon Hill, as well as to classmates in places like New York and Philadelphia where he knew Houqua's name would be appreciated. A mail-order business grew by word of mouth. Speciality shops like William Poll and A.S.J. Gentiles in New York and the Chestnut Hill Cheese Shop in Philadelphia sell Hu-Kwa. Keeping up with the times, the import company now has an e-commerce Web site.</p>
        <p>''Delicious,'' Jean Beard said, sipping her nice cup of Hu-Kwa.</p>
        <p>Tammy Faye Bakker wasn't converted. ''What can I say?'' she confessed. ''It's not Diet Coke.''</p>
        <p>Smoked Salmon Triangles With Horseradish and Dill</p>
        <p>4 ounces cream cheese</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon prepared horseradish</p>
        <p>Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p>
        <p>24 thin slices dark bread</p>
        <p>8 ounces smoked salmon, thinly sliced (about 24 slices).</p>
        <p>1. In a bowl, whip the cream cheese, dill and horseradish until light and fluffy. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>2. Spread the mixture over each slice of bread. Place 2 pieces of smoked salmon evenly on 12 of the bread slices. Top with the remaining bread slices.</p>
        <p>3. Cut the crusts off the finished sandwiches. Cut each sandwich diagonally into 4 triangles.</p>
        <p>Yield: 48 tea sandwiches.</p>
        <p>Almond Chicken Drums</p>
        <p>For the chicken salad:</p>
        <p>1 3-pound roasted chicken, bones removed</p>
        <p>1 cup fresh or prepared mayonnaise</p>
        <p>1/4 cup chopped chives</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon chopped fresh tarragon</p>
        <p>Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p>
        <p>For the drums:  24 thin slices white sandwich bread</p>
        <p>1/4 cup mayonnaise</p>
        <p>1 cup toasted almonds, finely chopped</p>
        <p>1. For the chicken salad, chop the meat until it is very fine. (Pulse it in a food processor if you like.) Add the mayonnaise, chives and tarragon. Mix until combined. Season with salt and pepper. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use.</p>
        <p>2. Spread an even layer of the chicken salad on 12 slices of the bread. Place the remaining bread slices on top, making 12 sandwiches. Using a round cookie cutter (about 1 1/2 inches), punch about 2 circles (or drums) out of each sandwich.</p>
        <p>3. For the drums, thinly coat the outer edges with mayonnaise. Roll the mayonnaise-covered edges in the almonds.</p>
        <p>Yield: About 24 chicken drums.</p>
        <p>Curried Shrimp On Brioche Rounds With Mint</p>
        <p>1/2 cup white wine</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon salt</p>
        <p>4 lemon slices</p>
        <p>15 medium shrimp, peeled and deveined</p>
        <p>1/2 cup prepared mayonnaise</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon curry powder</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon freshly squeezed lemon juice</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</p>
        <p>1 loaf brioche, sliced (about 15 slices)</p>
        <p>Julienned mint for garnish.</p>
        <p>1. In a medium-size saucepan, add 2 cups of water, wine, salt and lemon and bring to a boil. Add the shrimp, reduce the heat and cook until the shrimp are cooked through, about 3 minutes. Drain the shrimp. Set aside to cool, then slice each in half lengthwise.</p>
        <p>2. Place the mayonnaise in a bowl. Add the curry powder, lemon juice and parsley. Mix until combined.</p>
        <p>3. Using a round 1 1/2-inch cookie cutter, punch about 2 circles in each slice of brioche. Place the rounds on a baking sheet and toast lightly.</p>
        <p>4. Take the brioche rounds and put curried mayonnaise in the center of each. Place the halved pieces of shrimp on top and garnish with the mint. These sandwiches look best open-faced.</p>
        <p>Yield: About 30 sandwiches.</p>
        <p>Cranberry-Orange Scones</p>
        <p>1/2 cup dried cranberries</p>
        <p>1  1/2cup all-purpose flour</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons sugar</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon baking powder</p>
        <p>6 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon orange zest</p>
        <p>3/4 cup heavy cream.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.</p>
        <p>2. Place the cranberries in a saucepan with 1 cup water. Bring to a boil and remove from the heat. Soak the cranberries in the water until they soften, about 10 minutes. Drain and reserve the berries.</p>
        <p>3. Place the flour, salt, sugar and baking powder in a medium-size bowl. Work the butter into the flour mixture until it resembles coarse cornmeal. Mix in the orange zest and cranberries. Add the cream and mix lightly until the dough forms a ball (use more cream if needed).</p>
        <p>4. Place the dough on a lightly floured board and roll out  1/2-inch thick. Using a round cookie cutter (about 1 1/2 inches), press out circles, or cut the dough into 1 1/2-inch squares. Place the scones on an ungreased cookie sheet about an inch apart.</p>
        <p>5. Bake for about 15 minutes or until golden brown. Serve with clotted cream and jam.</p>
        <p>Yield: About 18 miniature scones.</p>
        <p>BLTea Blinis</p>
        <p>For the blinis:</p>
        <p>1 1/4 ounce package dry yeast</p>
        <p>1 3/4 cups all-purpose flour</p>
        <p>1 1/4 cups buckwheat flour</p>
        <p>3 eggs separated</p>
        <p>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>2 teaspoons sugar</p>
        <p>1 1/2 cups warm milk</p>
        <p>For the sandwiches:</p>
        <p>1/2 cup prepared mayonnaise</p>
        <p>10 slices bacon, cooked, crisp</p>
        <p>20 cherry tomatoes, sliced in disks</p>
        <p>20 arugula leaves.</p>
        <p>1. To make the blinis, in a large mixing bowl, mix the yeast with</p>
        <p>1 1/2 cups warm water. Set the bowl in a warm place and let it sit until foamy, about 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Whisk in the all-purpose flour. Cover the bowl with a damp towel; let it sit in a warm place until the mixture rises, about 1 hour.</p>
        <p>3. In another mixing bowl, combine the buckwheat flour, egg yolks, 4 tablespoons of the butter, salt, sugar and milk. Whisk until smooth. Thoroughly combine the buckwheat mixture and the yeast-flour mixture. Cover again with a damp towel; let it sit in a warm place so the batter rises by about half, about 1 hour.</p>
        <p>4. Beat the egg whites until stiff but not dry. Gently fold them into the batter.</p>
        <p>5. Over medium heat, brush a skillet with the remaining butter. Drop 1 tablespoon of the batter into the pan and cook until the bottom is golden. Flip and cook the other side. Repeat with the remaining batter -- you'll need about 40 blinis for this recipe. If you make these ahead of time, wrap and refrigerate until needed.</p>
        <p>6. For the sandwiches, take a blini and place a dollop of mayonnaise in the center. Place a 1-inch piece of bacon on the mayonnaise; add one slice of the tomato on top of that. Cover with a piece of arugula; top with a blini to make a sandwich.</p>
        <p>Yield: About 20 blini sandwiches.</p>

        <p>The Conversation  The Hu-Kwa tea is poured.</p>
        <p>Tammy Faye: Hmm.</p>
        <p>[Reaches for her can of Diet Coke]</p>
        <p>John Bartlett: In Tammy Faye's movie, you see, she has this thing for Diet Coke.</p>
        <p>Tammy Faye: Right from the can.</p>
        <p>Jean Beard: The tea is delicious.</p>
        <p>Blaine Trump: I think inviting someone for tea is like extending an olive branch of friendship, particularly if it is someone you don't know well enough to ask to dinner.</p>
        <p>Tammy Faye: I've got to have one of your brownies.</p>
        <p>John Bartlett: Did you ever have ladies' teas, Tammy Faye?</p>
        <p>Tammy Faye: [Laughs] No. Actually, I've never been a lady.</p>
