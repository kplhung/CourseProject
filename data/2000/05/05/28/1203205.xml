        <p>The Israeli Supreme Court ruled that women can hold group services, wear prayer shawls and read aloud from Torah scrolls at the Western Wall, a part of the Jewish temple complex that was destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70, and Judaism's most revered shrine.</p>
        <p>In keeping with strict Orthodox Jewish tradition, men and women worship at the wall in separate areas divided by a partition, and only the men hold services. The court gave the government six months to arrange for women's services.</p>

        <p>The Israeli Supreme Court ruled that women can hold group services, wear prayer shawls and read aloud from Torah scrolls at the Western Wall, a part of the Jewish temple complex that was destroyed by the Romans in A.D. 70, and Judaism's most revered shrine.</p>
        <p>In keeping with strict Orthodox Jewish tradition, men and women worship at the wall in separate areas divided by a partition, and only the men hold services. The court gave the government six months to arrange for women's services.</p>
        <p>''We've come out of the Middle Ages,'' said Anat Hoffman, a leader of the women's group. ''Today the Western Wall became part of the State of Israel.''</p>
        <p>The ruling was condemned by Orthodox officials and rabbis. Deputy Religious Affairs Minister Yigal Bibi, a member of the National Religious Party, said the Supreme Court had issued yet another ruling that would ''nullify the State of Israel as a Jewish state and turn it into a state of all its citizens.''</p>
