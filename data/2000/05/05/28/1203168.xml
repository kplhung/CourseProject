        <p>About 15 minutes after a group of a dozen teenagers began cooking the vegetables and meat for a heaping plate of nachos, a dispute arose.</p>
        <p>On one side was Daniel Mercado, 17, a Bronx resident who is in the culinary arts program of Park West High School in Manhattan. He wanted to fry the onions, mix them in with the beef and put the melted cheese on the side. On the other hand, his fellow chefs noted that the directions called for raw, diced onions to be sprinkled on top and for the cheese to be melted directly onto the tortillas.</p>
        <p>''I prefer to keep the chip dry -- you take the chip and dip it in the bowl,'' Daniel said in a way that indicated he knew his nachos. ''If you melt the cheese on the chips, the chips will be moist.''</p>
        <p>The teenagers were engaged in an exercise in food preparation and teamwork that was part of a weekend retreat at Camp Mariah in Fishkill, N.Y. The camp is one of five run by The Fresh Air Fund, a nonprofit agency that provides free summer vacations in the country to economically disadvantaged children from New York City.</p>
        <p>Darcel Serapio, 17, of the East New York section of Brooklyn, a cheese-on-top proponent, reminded Daniel that the group was being judged according to a 19-point list of instructions, one of which was to carefully follow the recipe. ''It says: 'Follow each step in the recipe,' '' she said, holding a printout from the Food.com Web site that contained the recipe.</p>
        <p>''We're a group; we can change the rules if we decide,'' Daniel countered.</p>
        <p>While the group debated, groups of teenagers elsewhere at the camp learned about balancing a checkbook, keeping credit card debt from skyrocketing and budgeting a household's resources.</p>
        <p>All the teenagers are members of the PreOccupations Club, a program for teenagers who have attended Camp Mariah. The camp prepares boys and girls 12 to 14 for work and careers by helping them set educational goals and get a summer job.</p>
        <p>''Having some experience in the summer is a great indicator of future career success,'' said Miriam Seidenfeld, the director of Camp Mariah and the PreOccupations Club program. ''And when you have a summer job, you get paid. The rewards are not so far in the future -- they're very here and now, which is important for that age group.''</p>
        <p>There are 56 high school students in the PreOccupations Club this year. They meet once a month at the Fresh Air Fund's office in Midtown and two weekends during the school year to continue the training and friendships that began at Camp Mariah.</p>
        <p>''I really like the camp,'' said Dionne Letts, a 15-year-old from the Bronx who attended Camp Mariah for three years and decided to continue on to the PreOccupations Club this year. ''It helps you to accomplish your goals and keeps you focused and stable.''</p>
        <p>While the students learn how to fill out a job application and how to impress an employer during an interview, the club also helps them build and maintain confidence.</p>
        <p>''We remind them that they have problem-solving skills, they have communications skills,'' Ms. Seidenfeld said. ''They don't need to be scared when they first go to a job.''</p>
        <p>One thing the former campers learn is how to resolve conflicts.</p>
        <p>''We want them to look at not just your favorite person's point of view or your own point of view, but anyone's point of view,'' Ms. Seidenfeld said. ''We teach them how to compromise or find alternative, creative solutions, to speak through problems, and how to handle them by deciding what you'll accept or be able to live with.''</p>
        <p>The group in the kitchen eventually chose to saute the onions and melt the cheese directly onto the nachos. Though they departed slightly from the instructions, they received a stellar review from the volunteer judge, Hortense Noble, vice president for global corporate events at Credit Suisse First Boston.</p>
        <p>''In the end, they all learned to work together and to resolve the conflict that comes from within the group,'' she said. ''They're going to encounter a lot of that when they start working.''</p>
        <p>Families wishing to inquire about registering children for a Fresh Air summer vacation can call (800) 367-0003. Anyone interested in making a tax-deductible contribution to the fund can send a check to: The Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018.</p>
