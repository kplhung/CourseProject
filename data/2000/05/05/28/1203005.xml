        <p>SOME church organists play with as much enthusiasm as a bus driver leaning on the horn in rush hour.

        <p>Since 1990, she has been the organist at the cavernous cathedral on Manhattan's Upper West Side, where she is known for adding jazz, African rhythms and real heart to centuries-old hymns.

        <p>SOME church organists play with as much enthusiasm as a bus driver leaning on the horn in rush hour. But when Dorothy Jean Papadakos, 39, climbs into the organ loft at the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine, one friend said, ''she rolls up her sleeves, pulls up her skirt and rocks.''</p>
        <p>Since 1990, she has been the organist at the cavernous cathedral on Manhattan's Upper West Side, where she is known for adding jazz, African rhythms and real heart to centuries-old hymns. ''She is so creative and improvisational and daring with the organ, it's bordering on the illegal,'' said Philippe Petit, the high-wire artist and a friend of Ms. Papadakos.</p>
        <p>She is as lively and unorthodox as her music. Her letters are full of exclamation points. She wears bright flowers in her hair, partly in tribute to her father, the late Peter J. Papadakos, an aeronautical engineer and amateur horticulturist. He grew banana trees, birds of paradise and other exotic flora in their backyard greenhouse in St. James, N.Y.</p>
        <p>When she speaks -- about roses, scuba diving in the Galapagos Islands or tea at Bendel's -- she has the sweet enthusiasm of Judy Garland as Dorothy in ''The Wizard of Oz.'' Ms. Papadakos lives on the cathedral grounds in an apartment with leaded windows, full of candles and Victorian antiques, with priests as her neighbors and the church bells as her alarm clock.</p>
        <p>Last year, Ms. Papadakos traveled to a Wilmington, N.C., beach for a predawn Easter vigil organized by the Rev. Joe Cooper, an Episcopal priest and a friend. Standing on the sand, listening to drummers and Bible storytellers, she met a landscape architect named Tracy Otto McCullen.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCullen, 41, a Wilmington native, is a lot like her. While she wears flowers, he decorates the inside of his truck with wisteria vines, Carolina jasmine and Lady Banks roses.</p>
        <p>During the vigil, even in near darkness, he noticed Ms. Papadakos. ''I thought, 'Who is this gorgeous woman?' '' he remembered. ''She had dark skin and long, thick, dark hair and an exotic summer dress. She didn't look like a Southern belle.''</p>
        <p>The next day, he showed her gardens he had designed. ''At one house, Tracy put in these beautiful sculptures and nature trails and plants,'' she recalled. ''It was an instant flashback to Dad. I was like, 'Wow, Dad, check this out!' ''</p>
        <p>A few weeks later, she visited Mr. McCullen in Wilmington. He came to the airport for her with his truck full of flowers he had picked in her honor. That set the tone for a New York-North Carolina courtship that was full of music, ''Winnie-the-Pooh,'' barefoot walks in the sand, morning yoga and daily hoots of joy that they had found each other. ''They remind me of bees, running from one flower to another, trying the different nectars,'' Father Cooper said.</p>
        <p>On May 20, the couple were married at the cathedral in a wedding that began with Piffaro, the Renaissance-music wind band, leading a merry candlelight procession through the dark aisles. The wedding party included bridesmaids in velvet gowns and floral wreaths; ushers dressed like huntsmen or 15th-century courtiers; a woman carrying a smoking pot of incense; a man wearing a unicorn headdress; and the bride at the very end, in a rust-colored, jeweled, gown with a vinelike rhinestone tiara. At the reception that followed in the cathedral's synod hall, a masked stilt walker danced around, and Mr. Petit performed on a high wire, sprinkling gold dust on the bride and bridegroom below.</p>
        <p>The couple, who will continue commuting, have bought a cottage they are renovating on a bluff at Wrightsville Beach, N.C. ''We added two balconies,'' Mr. McCullen said. ''One is called the Romeo balcony, and the other is called the Juliet balcony. The Romeo balcony is a small deck surrounded by palm trees, where you can take outdoor showers all the time. The Juliet balcony is facing the driveway, so when I leave in the morning, Dorothy can stand there and blow kisses and throw flowers.''</p>
