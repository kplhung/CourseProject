        <p>In the first week of November 1993, general managers were meeting in Naples, Fla., and the Yankees' general manager, Gene Michael, was there in quest of a starting pitcher. Among others, Michael had an eye on a young right-hander employed by the Los Angeles Dodgers.</p>
        <p>''Gene Michael was one of the guys most interested in Pedro,'' recalled Fred Claire, who was then the Dodgers' general manager. ''He really was the only one who was inquiring. He had a great interest. I said: 'Gene, I don't want to talk to you about who you might offer. I'm not going to trade him. He's a great young man and has a great upside.' ''</p>

        <p>In the first week of November 1993, general managers were meeting in Naples, Fla., and the Yankees' general manager, Gene Michael, was there in quest of a starting pitcher. Among others, Michael had an eye on a young right-hander employed by the Los Angeles Dodgers.</p>
        <p>''Gene Michael was one of the guys most interested in Pedro,'' recalled Fred Claire, who was then the Dodgers' general manager. ''He really was the only one who was inquiring. He had a great interest. I said: 'Gene, I don't want to talk to you about who you might offer. I'm not going to trade him. He's a great young man and has a great upside.' ''</p>
        <p>No pitcher ever had a greater upside than Pedro Martinez, the dominating pitcher who is scheduled to start for the Boston Red Sox against the Yankees tonight. Had Michael been successful in prying Martinez from the Dodgers, he could have been pitching for the Yankees.</p>
        <p>As the Dodgers' plans developed, they did trade Martinez, less than three weeks after Michael expressed his serious interest. They traded him to the Montreal Expos because the Expos offered them a second baseman, Delino DeShields. Jody Reed, who had been Los Angeles's second baseman in 1993 and had become a free agent, rejected an offer he shouldn't have refused. To his great regret, Reed said no to a three-year, $7.8 million contract and later had to accept a contract with Milwaukee for $350,000 for one year. As much as Reed's decision hurt him economically, it hurt the Dodgers competitively.</p>
        <p>''Looking back, it turned out to be a terrible deal for us,'' Claire said. Had they not needed a second baseman, he added, he would, as he told Michael, not have traded Martinez. But even given that need, Claire said: ''What I didn't put enough weight on was the spirit of Pedro. I recognized it but didn't put a high enough value on it. This young man has something that few people I encounter has and I should have recognized that.''</p>
        <p>Dan Duquette, the general manager who acquired Martinez for the Expos, left Montreal about two months later and became the Boston general manager. He reluctantly left Martinez behind but was intent on getting him again. He did, four years to the day after he obtained him from Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>''Pedro has always been my favorite player,'' Duquette said, ''because of his unique skills and his personality and his competitiveness. We are so lucky to have him. We owe a great debt to the Expo organization. He was a gift to the franchise.''</p>
        <p>Jim Beattie, Duquette's successor in Montreal, didn't want to trade Martinez, but explained why he did.</p>
        <p>''We probably could have paid him,'' Beattie said, ''but he wasn't going to sign with us until we did other things to show we were going to be competitive. We couldn't afford to do those other things. We couldn't convince him, so we felt the best thing to do was move him before he became a free agent.''</p>
        <p>Boston won the arm of the right-hander by offering Carl Pavano, a good young pitcher, and Tony Armas Jr., a minor league pitcher they had received from the Yankees for Mike Stanley three months earlier.</p>
        <p>''A couple clubs turned us down when we asked for their players,'' Beattie said. ''I'm sure some of those organizations look at it now and say, 'How could we say no?' ''</p>
        <p>The Yankees wouldn't trade Eric Milton for Martinez (they sent him to Minnesota for Chuck Knoblauch less than three months later). Cleveland declined to give up Bartolo Colon, who is in their starting rotation now.</p>
        <p>Beattie can still feel the pain from trading Martinez. ''I definitely would have loved to have kept him,'' he said. ''He's got quality pitches, he's a great competitor, he's an intelligent player and he works hard.''</p>
        <p>Duquette credited Martinez with turning the Red Sox into a legitimate contender. The Red Sox have reached the postseason in each of the pitcher's first two seasons with them and appear to be headed there again this year.</p>
        <p>Martinez, who has won the Cy Young award in each league, gained a permanent spot in postseason lore last October by pitching six hitless innings of relief against Cleveland in the fifth and deciding game of their division series. He followed that remarkable performance by holding the Yankees to two hits in seven innings after the Yankees had won the first two games of the league championship series. The Yankees, however, won the next two games, assuring that they wouldn't see Martinez in Game 7.</p>
        <p>''That was a situation we certainly wanted to do everything we could to avoid,'' David Cone said. ''I don't think any team in baseball would want that scenario.''</p>
        <p>Martinez's playoff performance wasn't even his best against the Yankees last year. In September he struck out 17 and allowed just 1 hit, a home run by Chili Davis. That gave him a two-start record of 29 strikeouts and 3 hits allowed in 16 innings.</p>
        <p>''He could've won without any fielders behind him that night,'' Paul O'Neill said of the September game.</p>
        <p>Martinez enters tonight's game with the lowest earned run average (1.19) and the lowest opponents' batting average (.167) in the major leagues. Last season he had the majors' lowest e.r.a. and was three points away from having the lowest batting average against.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what Sandy Koufax was like during his incredible five-year run that everyone talks about,'' Cone said, ''but Pedro's having that type of run, maybe even better. He's having arguably one of the best runs of all time. One year, two year, three year.''</p>
        <p>Jason Giambi of Oakland, one of this season's most productive hitters, called Martinez's pitches ''electric.'' Larry Rothschild, the Tampa Bay manager and a former pitcher and pitching coach, said Martinez's fastball, curve and changeup are outstanding individually and collectively.</p>
        <p>''In an at-bat against him,'' Giambi said, ''you get one pitch to hit and if you don't hit it, you're heading back to the dugout.'' Yet Giambi said that he likes to face Martinez. ''It's such a challenge,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Rothschild, too, acknowledged that he enjoyed watching Martinez work even if he beats the Devil Rays.</p>
        <p>''I almost hate to admit that,'' the manager said, ''but he's so good at what he does you have to sit back and realize you're watching one of the best there is and take solace from that.''</p>
        <p>Making Baseballs</p>
        <p>Major league officials were in Costa Rica last week touring the Rawlings factory that makes major league baseballs. Orlando Hernandez was there two years earlier.</p>
        <p>''I visited twice, once before I signed and once after I signed,'' said the Yankees pitcher, who lived in Costa Rica immediately after defecting from Cuba. ''I've never seen anything like that. I saw it in Cuba, but it wasn't the same. The quality of the materials is better in Costa Rica.</p>
        <p>''What impressed me the most was the way they make a baseball. It took me 35 minutes to make a baseball myself. The boss said to me, 'You may be a good ballplayer, but you  don't know anything about making baseballs.' ''</p>
        <p>Hernandez, who apparently is the only major league player who has visited the factory, was asked if the ball he made was juiced.</p>
        <p>He laughed and said through a translator, ''If the baseballs were made the way I made it, there would be no home runs.''</p>
        <p>Indians' Pitching Woes</p>
        <p>For several years the Cleveland Indians tried unsuccessfully to secure a No. 1 pitcher. Last winter they finally succeeded, luring Chuck Finley into the fold as a free agent. The pitching gods, however, are still laughing at them.</p>
        <p>On the same day earlier this month, two starters, Charles Nagy and Jaret Wright, and a reliever, Ricardo Rincon, went on the disabled list. Last week another reliever, Paul Shuey, joined them. Wright returned last night but lasted only 12 batters and one and one-third innings as he gave up seven runs to the White Sox.</p>
        <p>Nagy had bone chips removed from his right elbow and is expected to be out for eight weeks.</p>
        <p>The Indians used two rookies in their place last week.</p>
        <p>Paul Rigdon dazzled the Yankees, shutting them out on two hits in his seven-inning effort, but Tim Drew, brother of J. D., lasted only three batters into the second inning against Detroit, giving up five runs (three earned).</p>
        <p>Rigdon's trouble came later. He strained a muscle in his left side Friday and was placed on the disabled list yesterday.</p>
        <p>Vidro's Hitting Soars</p>
        <p>When Jose Vidro first reached the major leagues, in 1997, he replaced an injured Vladimir Guerrero on the Montreal roster. Last week he supplanted the highly talented Guerrero as the Expos' leading hitter.</p>
        <p>The unheralded second baseman, who in his first full major league season last year batted .304, reached .399 last week and then entered last night's game in San Diego at .391 to Guerrero's .381. ''I've always liked him as a hitter,'' Jim Beattie, the Expos' general manager, said. ''He reminds me of Edgar Martinez in his knowledge of hitting.''</p>
        <p>Noting that Vidro had hit eight home runs, Beattie added: ''Edgar didn't have a lot of power when he came up, but he developed it at the big league level. Jose has a chance to hit 20 to 30 home runs depending on how hot he gets. He has a great approach to hitting and he's a smart player.''</p>
        <p>The 25-year-old switch-hitter also was leading the league in hits (70) and multihit games (22) and was tied for the lead in doubles (17).</p>
