        <p>The consensus that emerged from the Jets' four-day minicamp, which concluded Friday, was that even though the transition from Bill Parcells to Al Groh, the new head coach, has seemed seamless, Groh's minicamp was more intense than any Parcells held.</p>
        <p>Parcells was always concerned about the possibility of injury when players hit without pads. But Groh had the Jets practicing goal-line plays without the benefit of pads, which players certainly noticed and were not always happy about.</p>

        <p>The consensus that emerged from the Jets' four-day minicamp, which concluded Friday, was that even though the transition from Bill Parcells to Al Groh, the new head coach, has seemed seamless, Groh's minicamp was more intense than any Parcells held.</p>
        <p>Parcells was always concerned about the possibility of injury when players hit without pads. But Groh had the Jets practicing goal-line plays without the benefit of pads, which players certainly noticed and were not always happy about.</p>
        <p>The hitting was so hard last week that a fight erupted between the rookie defensive end Shaun Ellis and offensive tackle Ryan Young.</p>
        <p>''He's told us he wants us to be a tough team,'' offensive lineman Randy Thomas said. ''I think we're capable of doing that. This isn't baseball. You get violent out there.''</p>
        <p>Maurice Carthon, who played for Parcells with the Giants and is now one of Groh's top assistants, has noticed the difference. He recalled that one of Groh's favorite ways to judge a player is whether he is the kind who will ''stick his face in the fan.''</p>
        <p>''Not to take anything away from anything Bill's done, but these practices are probably the most intense practices I've had in years at training camp,'' Carthon said. ''The players are noticing that.''</p>
        <p>Groh insisted that the regimen at his minicamp -- the first time he dealt with the team's veterans as head coach -- was not developed to set himself apart from Parcells, who attended the first two days of practices and stood on the sideline.</p>
        <p>''It's by design, but that's just because that's me,'' Groh said of his tough practices. ''I'm not trying to send a message. I'm just coaching the team the way I would coach a team.''</p>
        <p>Concern for Running Back</p>
        <p>Leon Johnson's injury was the forgotten one, an injury that happened the same day quarterback Vinny Testaverde was lost for the 1999 season with a torn Achilles' tendon.</p>
        <p>But Johnson, a running back and kick returner, sustained a knee injury last season every bit as catastrophic as Testaverde's injury.</p>
        <p>Johnson, who had a superb rookie year in 1997, when he averaged 12.1 yards a punt return and 26.6 yards a kickoff return, had hoped to regain his form after a disappointing second season. But the injury stopped that plan, and Al Groh recently expressed concern that Johnson's rehabilitation was not progressing as quickly as he had hoped.</p>
        <p>''Leon is such a gifted athlete he never really had to work hard,'' Maurice Carthon said. ''Now, with the injury, he has had to work a little harder. He has to get it in his mind where he says to himself 'I can get back to the form I had in 1997.' ''</p>
        <p>Johnson said he did not know if the coaches planned to have him return kicks. Rather, his main role may be as Curtis Martin's backup and as a third-down specialist.</p>
        <p>''I know it's not the same as last year, when I had a healthy knee,'' Johnson said. ''I know it's not going to be 100 percent. But I have to get it to the point where I feel good.''</p>
