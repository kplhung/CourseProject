        <p>'IKES' ON THE WEB</p>
        <p>Older people are surfing the Web in increasing numbers for shopping, travel and everything else, which, on the Web, really does mean everything else.</p>
        <p>People aged 50 and older made up 21.8 percent of all those who logged onto the Internet from home last month, according to Nielsen Net Ratings. And they spend more: During last year's holiday shop ping period, the average online shopper spent a total of $629, while shoppers 55 and older spent $1,819, according to Zona Research.</p>

        <p>'IKES' ON THE WEB</p>
        <p>Older people are surfing the Web in increasing numbers for shopping, travel and everything else, which, on the Web, really does mean everything else.</p>
        <p>People aged 50 and older made up 21.8 percent of all those who logged onto the Internet from home last month, according to Nielsen Net Ratings. And they spend more: During last year's holiday shop ping period, the average online shopper spent a total of $629, while shoppers 55 and older spent $1,819, according to Zona Research.</p>
        <p>''The financial power of mature consumers, coupled with their tendency to have more leisure time available and their growing numbers, make this segment one of particular interest to the U.S. travel industry,'' said a 1995 report by the Travel Industry Association of America. An article in the journal American Demographics in 1994, before the Web was a factor, calls the generation that grew up when Dwight D. Eisenhower was Supreme Commander and President the ''Ikes,'' and says they ''spend freely on grandchildren, new cars and homes and travel.''</p>
        <p>Where do seniors start shopping for travel online? Well, www.senior.com (pay attention to the name) offers a selection of articles about travel with links to sites for lodging, cruise lines and such. Then there's www.seniors.com (not the same thing), which also has articles, but no links. And www.generationa.com offers articles and travel tips (''no self-respecting light traveler checks luggage''). You can also try www.aarp.org, which has a few travel articles, some with links, and also offers discounts to members, who must be 50 or over, that may or may not be better than what you can get just by asking the establishments.</p>
        <p>Any search engine -- Yahoo, Altavista, etc. -- will lead you to scores of sites for older travelers and everybody else. An exhaustive guide to all kinds of travel, including travel for seniors, is at www. specialtytravel.com. Click on the Activity Index, scroll down to Seniors/Retired, and then pick one of the scores of countries. Bouncing around, I found six trips in England, two in Greece and another six in New Zealand. When you select one that sounds promising, you get a description of what the company offers and where to get further information.</p>
        <p>The prime site, if you don't mind stretching your brain cells, is www.  elderhostel.org, now celebrating its 25th anniversary. Last year almost 175,000 people 55 and older visited universities, national parks, museums and other places in more than 85 countries. The programs consist of one to four weeks of lectures, discussions, field trips and the like.</p>
