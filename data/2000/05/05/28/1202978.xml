        <p>Lewisboro town planners have ordered Mary Clark and her son, Arthur Clark Jr., both of Pound Ridge, to pay $25,000 for altering wetlands on Deepwell Farms Road without a permit. They were fined $10,000 for dumping fill on a combined acre of regulated wetlands, another $10,000 for digging a 150-foot drainage channel on the wetlands and $5,000 for failing to install and maintain erosion controls at the site, the Town Planning Board reported. The Clarks did not have a building permit. The two lots were originally part of a subdivision, but Wetlands laws are now stricter than they were then. The Planning Department did not know what the Clarks planned to do with the property, officials said. ''It's one of the worst cases I've seen in my six and a half years on the board,'' Vincent A. Vetrano, chairman, said. ''When the violations are egregious and when the violators are aware they are breaking the law, our board takes a very, very tough stand.''</p>
