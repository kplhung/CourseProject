        <p>WHEN a stroke at 24 left Tim Podell partially paralyzed and unable to speak, the sadness of his hospital visitors seemed to him to be oddly misplaced.</p>
        <p>''The hardest thing about not being able to talk was I couldn't tell people I'll be O.K.,''  Mr. Podell, 36, said. ''My parents, my friends were coming in looking like, 'Oh, poor Tim, he's destined for a life in a hospital,' and I wanted to tell them: 'That's not true. I'll get out of here and make something of myself.' ''</p>

        <p>WHEN a stroke at 24 left Tim Podell partially paralyzed and unable to speak, the sadness of his hospital visitors seemed to him to be oddly misplaced.</p>
        <p>''The hardest thing about not being able to talk was I couldn't tell people I'll be O.K.,''  Mr. Podell, 36, said. ''My parents, my friends were coming in looking like, 'Oh, poor Tim, he's destined for a life in a hospital,' and I wanted to tell them: 'That's not true. I'll get out of here and make something of myself.' ''</p>
        <p>So while his mother looked for a nursing home for a young man who couldn't communicate, Mr. Podell, who had been a magician, journalist and cable television showman before his stroke, plotted his comeback.</p>
        <p>And come back he did. Mr. Podell recovered from the stroke and is now president of a company, Tim Podell Productions, based in Ossining, that produces videotaped interviews of popular children's writers.</p>
        <p>His series, called ''Good Conversation,'' includes 37 videos, each highlighting a different author. The tapes are used by teachers of third-grade-through-eighth-grade classes nationwide to augment reading curriculums.</p>
        <p>The videos feature writers like the 1999 Newberry Award winner Louis Sachar (''Holes'') and such previous winners as Phyllis Reynolds Naylor (''Shiloh''), Jean Craighead George (''Julie of the Wolves'') and Lynne Reid Banks (''The Indian in the Cupboard'').</p>
        <p>Mr. Podell interviews the authors in their homes, at their desks and walking the streets of their small towns. He captures them talking to their dogs, showing off family pictures and discussing their daily routines. The authors share the secrets of how they get ideas, organize their material and bring bits of themselves to the page.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to demystify the whole writing process by showing authors talking to me in their kitchens,'' Mr. Podell said. ''The cool thing about these videotapes is that they show that authors are real people.''</p>
        <p>Tim Podell Productions has sold about $1 million worth of videotapes since Mr. Podell interviewed his first author in 1991, he said. He only went into the business full time in 1994.</p>
        <p>Judith Rovenger, youth services consultant for the Westchester Library System, said Mr. Podell's timing was right. Starting in the late 1980's, children's authors became celebrities on the school circuit, visiting classrooms regularly. Soon educators realized that introducing students to their favorite authors was a great way to inspire a love of reading and writing.</p>
        <p>''We want children to realize that books are written by live people, not just some dead person or disembodied thing,'' Ms. Rovenger said. ''That way the literary experience extends beyond the pages of the book. Children see that the book is attached at one end to a real person with real experiences.''</p>
        <p>Authors are paid a royalty for the tapes, but nothing up front. The real incentive for the writers is Mr. Podell's open-ended interviewing style, which allows authors to talk at length, as they would during a normal conversation.</p>
        <p>''In this little world of children's books, authors feel a great responsibility toward their readers, the kids,'' said Mr. Podell, whose spartan office contains rows of children's books. ''The whole point of these tapes is to make the authors look wonderful. We are very aware of that.''</p>
        <p>In a roundabout way, it was Mr. Podell's health problems that led him to his business. He regained his speech a few months after the stroke. A few years of therapy later, Mr. Podell recovered almost fully, though his right arm and hand are still paralyzed and he walks with a slight limp.</p>
        <p>He wanted to use the television production skills he had learned before his illness. As a high school student in Briarcliff Manor, he produced shows for cable access broadcast. Later he produced news shows for governmental agencies in Yonkers and the Bronx.</p>
        <p>''You learn so much because it's seat-of-your-pants television,'' Mr. Podell said. ''Some shows you do camera. Some shows you direct. Some shows you'll just be the person standing there, saying, 'There's five minutes left.' ''</p>
        <p>Afraid that the stroke would prevent broadcasters from hiring him, Mr. Podell decided to go into business for himself.</p>
        <p>Armed with a $6,000 loan from his father, Richard, a retired salesman of medical devices, he called Ms. George, a Tarrytown resident, naturalist and children's author whom he had interviewed years before for a local cable access show. She consented to become his first full-length interview.</p>
        <p>The tape was rejected by every children's book publisher Mr. Podell presented it to, but in the meantime, he sent a copy to the School Library Journal, a monthly digest of publications for educators and librarians. It gave the tape a favorable review and soon Mr. Podell was making copies in his parents' Briarcliff Manor basement and filling orders himself.</p>
        <p>''Then I realized I didn't need a publisher; I could do this myself,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Podell makes between four and eight new tapes a year. Tim Podell Productions consists of himself and a secretary. He hires a different freelance video crew for each author he tapes, contracts out with a video tape editor and distribution service and relies on good references from the authors he has profiled to entice new authors to sign on.</p>
        <p>Recently the company produced a new series of educational videos, ''Careers in the 21st Century.'' When he runs out of authors to interview, Mr. Podell hopes to option a book of one of his authors and make a feature-length children's movie.</p>
        <p>Once again, if he can't persuade a big company to go for his idea, he will finance it himself.</p>
        <p>''If I can't find someone to back me,'' he said, ''I'll make it myself.''</p>
