        <p>When the news broke that UAL and US Airways planned to merge, many an eye turned to Julian H. Robertson Jr.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Robertson announced in March that he was winding down his Tiger Management hedge fund, he said five of its equity investments would be retained a while, because they were large stakes relative to the size of the companies and would fetch more if not liquidated abruptly. US Airways was one of the five, and boy, was he right: the merger deal has since increased its market value by more than 50 percent.</p>
        <p>Well, if that one worked out so well, what about the other four -- Normandy Mining, which mines gold and silver in Australia and New Zealand; Xtra, a trucking company; Gtech Holding, which makes lottery equipment; and United Asset Management, a money management firm?</p>
        <p>Frazier Seitel, a spokesman for Tiger Management, confirmed last Friday that the fund still holds all four, with stakes ranging from 11 percent to 26 percent of the companies. The fund ''is optimistic that their proper value will be realized,'' he said.</p>
        <p>So far the rewards of patience on these four have been spotty: since the end of March, Xtra and Gtech Holding have advanced briskly in price, while the other two have gone nowhere.</p>
