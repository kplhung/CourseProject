        <p>THOMAS KUHN</p>
        <p>A Philosophical History for Our Times.</p>
        <p>By Steve Fuller.</p>

        <p>One of the few books that most college graduates in this anticanonical age are expected to have heard of, if not to have read, is ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions,'' by Thomas S. Kuhn. First published in 1962, when its author was a 40-year-old professor of history at Berkeley, it has been translated into two dozen languages and is cited in countless articles and books spanning virtually all social scientific and humanistic disciplines. Journalists report that it is Vice President Al Gore's favorite book. Yet ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' was written for philosophers, not the general public. It is relentlessly academic. Dozens of more accessible books about science and its history are forgotten soon after they appear. Why did this treatise on scientific development become one of the most influential academic books of the 20th century? The question is given point by the fact that most defenders of this book, to say nothing of its critics, acknowledge that many of its arguments are flawed.</p>
        <p>One person who thinks he has the whole Kuhn episode figured out is Steve Fuller, a philosophically trained sociologist at the University of Warwick in England. In ''Thomas Kuhn: A Philosophical History for Our Times,'' Fuller asserts that most people who take Kuhn seriously just aren't very clever: Kuhn's book is so vague as to be an inkblot; people make of it what they will. This has long been one standard answer to the question of Kuhn's popularity. Kuhn was a lightweight, in this telling, and his influence is a sign of our ostensibly dreadful times, when even the learned can't tell a mediocre mind from an intellectual giant. A second answer, also of long standing, is that ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' contained a lot of good ideas about how science works. In this view, Kuhn's ability to speak effectively to certain specific interests compensated for the holes in his analysis, and made it possible for people who were not fools to get a great deal out of the book.</p>
        <p>Both answers begin with the same basic understanding of how Kuhn challenged inherited views of science. Before Kuhn, most people understood scientific progress in terms of a series of heroic individual discoveries that contributed to an accumulating body of knowledge warranted, ultimately, by nature itself. Kuhn argued that tightly organized communities of specialists, not individual minds, were the central actors in scientific development, and that these communities made progress in two distinctive modes. In ''normal science,'' researchers did narrow, technical work guided by a ''paradigm,'' a view of the field that served as a set of predictions for what investigators would find. When these researchers observed, instead, a lot of things that did not fit, the community entered a period of ''revolutionary science.'' In this mode, the community debated the utility of alternative paradigms and eventually selected one that explained a greater range of relevant phenomena and promised to guide the next phase of normal science.</p>
        <p>Kuhn went on to suggest that scientific development is best seen not as progress toward a fixed goal set by nature but as progress from existing knowledge toward more fully confirmed answers to questions scientists put to nature. Since the questions themselves sometimes change, the progress of science is discontinuous.</p>
        <p>But most philosophers and historians soon came to the conclusion that Kuhn's signature concept of the paradigm was frustratingly vague. They generally agreed, too, that his pivotal distinction between revolutionary and normal science was hard to sustain. Even some of the great revolutions in biology and physics, moreover, proved hard to shoehorn into his model. Many thinkers who were convinced by Kuhn's case for the historical contingency of scientific truth conceded that his formulations were too ambiguous to play more than a heuristic role in the conversation about ''relativism'' he had stimulated.</p>
        <p>Fuller carries the dismissal of Kuhn and his sympathetic readers to a snide extreme. Kuhn himself, who died in 1996 as an emeritus professor at M.I.T., emerges from Fuller's account as a well-meaning simpleton. Fuller explicitly compares him to Chance, the character played by Peter Sellers in the movie ''Being There,'' based on Jerzy Kosinski's novel. Chance finds himself in a conversation he does not quite understand, and says things that other people misinterpret as profound because they believe he is someone else. Kuhn's relation to his audience, Fuller declares, is ''a similar comedy of errors.'' Kuhn was the proverbial dwarf standing on the shoulders of giants. From a distance, ''the dwarf may look like the head of the tallest giant.''</p>
        <p>Fuller provides glimpses of a potentially provocative analysis of the political matrix of Kuhn's popularity. But he implausibly attributes to personal connections much of Kuhn's rise to prominence, as if readers cared that Kuhn was a protege of James B. Conant, a former president of Harvard University. Fuller's Kuhn is also a political cat's-paw for the more worldly Conant, whom Fuller presents as a defender of Big Science who was happy with an image of science as too specialized and autonomous to be subject to public control. Fuller sees ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' as ''an exemplary document of the cold war era,'' and says its chief impact has been ''to dull the critical sensibility of the academy.''</p>
        <p>''Thomas Kuhn: A Philosophical History for Our Times'' is nearly unreadable by any but the most devoted maven of the sectarian disputes between specialists in the sociology and philosophy of science. Copious and polemical footnotes exhaust even a professional reader's patience. If a prize were awarded to the academic who persuaded a major publisher to accept the most footnotes citing himself, Fuller would be a strong contender. He makes almost no effort to explore the numerous substantial justifications for the second, more generous explanation for Kuhn's influence. Kuhn spoke directly, if unintentionally, to a widespread honest curiosity about how science related to the psychology and politics of nonscientific experience.</p>
        <p>Kuhn emphasized the power of pre-conceived ideas to control the observations of scientists, and insisted that without the focusing effect of these ideas investigators would not be able actually to see the phenomena the explanation of which was essential to the creating of new knowledge. A fully ''open'' mind cannot focus on the relevant particulars. What made this contribution so important was the widespread presumption that scientists, rather than being bound by preconceptions, were open-minded in the sense of always questioning inherited ideas. Kuhn's emphasis was not unique among his generation's theorists of science.</p>
        <p>But Kuhn developed the point compellingly with concrete examples and with a social-psychological language that enabled a range of readers to grasp the function of provisionally unquestioned presuppositions. What was equally important, he assimilated the behavior of scientific communities into popularly understood theories of the dynamics of other human communities while simultaneously offering an account of the distinctiveness of the most technically developed of natural sciences.</p>
        <p>HE applied to science a vocabulary normally used to describe political actors, especially during revolutions. Communities of scientists, like political communities, were organized by certain traditions that periodically came under strain and were then revised, sometimes sweepingly. The leaders of both kinds of communities were genuine wielders of power, who used their positions to bring their constituencies into line.</p>
        <p>But, while Kuhn thus opened up the entire domain of science for political analysis, he argued that the behaviorally visible mark of a truly scientific community was its high degree of autonomy, its ability to exercise authority over its own intellectual affairs. He confirmed the instinct that science was ''really different.'' But he also showed that scientists, within their domain, behaved very much like the rest of us.</p>
        <p>''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'' presented the strongest case ever made for the dependence of valid science on distinctively constituted, historically particular human communities. Far from dulling the academy's critical capacities, Kuhn directed those capacities at scientific communities that were previously spared the searching scrutiny he inspired. He demystified science without degrading it, and in so doing he saw beyond previous theorists of science without denigrating them.</p>
