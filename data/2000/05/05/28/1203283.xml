        <p>IN eating, as in life, style counts. So I will say this straight out: I'm not the sort of guy who willingly eats meals-on-a-stick.</p>
        <p>Apparently not everyone shares my dim view. Breakaway Foods recently introduced IncrEdibles, tubular containers of such unlikely dishes as scrambled eggs and macaroni with cheese, served on a stick and meant to be eaten on the run. IncrEdibles are just one of several new foods that, to hear the marketers tell it, are exactly what time-starved consumers are yearning for.</p>
        <p>Despite my skepticism, I found that IncrEdibles' scrambled eggs-on-a-stick wasn't bad at all, certainly better than the typically leathery coffee shop scrambled eggs. But as I looked at the slender cylinder, which you microwave and then hold like a Popsicle as you push the food up through the top, I couldn't help wondering, what's the point?</p>
        <p>Of course, the on-the-stick concept has clear antecedents. Anybody who's ever been to a tractor pull is intimately familiar with the corn dog, a breaded frankfurter on a stick, which has been life's blood at county fairs for more than half a century.</p>
        <p>Another entry in the ''hyperconvenience'' market, Frito-Lay's Chili &amp; Scoops, is likewise a repackaging of an old idea, the Frito pie. In fact, Chili &amp; Scoops, which pairs in one package a bag of scoop-shaped corn chips and a container of microwaveable chili, is a step backward in convenience from the Frito pie, in which you open a bag of Fritos and pour the chili directly into the bag and over the chips. As truck drivers know, one container beats two anytime.</p>
        <p>Breakaway Foods asserts that IncrEdibles is the logical next step in a progression that includes Wonder Bread, airline food and TV dinners. I agree with them completely, though I will leave you to decide whether this is a good thing.</p>
        <p>Impressions of three hyperconvenience foods follow, in order of preference.</p>
