        <p>Happy National Teacher Day! There's still time, people, to send your children's instructor a little remembrance -- a box of cookies, a nice book, some Microsoft stock you aren't using anymore. Meanwhile let's take a moment to discuss the ever-soaring state of Standards in Education.</p>
        <p>Obviously, Higher Standards require well-qualified teachers, and it is for this reason that 39 states have adopted basic skills tests for new faculty. Unfortunately, 36 of these states waive said test when they're short on staff, leaving a certain number of students in the hands of educators who have not necessarily proven their ability to name the days of the week.</p>

        <p>Happy National Teacher Day! There's still time, people, to send your children's instructor a little remembrance -- a box of cookies, a nice book, some Microsoft stock you aren't using anymore. Meanwhile let's take a moment to discuss the ever-soaring state of Standards in Education.</p>
        <p>Obviously, Higher Standards require well-qualified teachers, and it is for this reason that 39 states have adopted basic skills tests for new faculty. Unfortunately, 36 of these states waive said test when they're short on staff, leaving a certain number of students in the hands of educators who have not necessarily proven their ability to name the days of the week.</p>
        <p>Some of you may find it strange that individuals who cannot pass a basic skills test would go into teaching in the first place. Perhaps they were lured by the opportunity, offered in many overcrowded districts, to eat lunch at 10 o'clock in the morning. Perhaps they felt peculiarly suited to a career where salaries begin, on average, at $8,000 a year less than other professions and end, on average, at $24,000 less.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, we have not seen so much political commitment to better schools since the 1988 campaign, when George Bush and Michael Dukakis each announced he intended to become the ''education president.'' The golden age of pedagogy that everyone expected to flow from this contest somehow failed to arrive. Now Al Gore and George W. Bush trade assault e-mail on the subject every single day. Mr. Bush cannot talk enough about the way he's improved the schools in Texas. He is particularly voluble about having ended social promotion, about how he insisted that no Texas child go from the third grade to the fourth until he or she could read at grade level.</p>
        <p>''It's important to have high standards,'' he told a county Republican gathering a while back, using a Bush ian gesture that indicates the height he had in mind was about five feet.</p>
        <p>In truth, the first kids who will ever be affected by that policy are currently in kindergarten. This is the classic political approach to the setting of standards on any topic. You want to be strict about the required levels of achievement, but loose about the timetable. The ideal due date, in fact, is the year after whoever sets the standards leaves office. If Mr. Bush is lucky, by the time Texas third graders start getting held back, he'll be in Washington preparing for his re-election campaign.</p>
        <p>Amazing the things you can accomplish with long-term projections. Residents here in New York have already been informed that come 2004, the state debt will suddenly shrink to manageable proportions and our high school seniors will be able to pass challenging tests in math, english, science, history and global studies in order to graduate.</p>
        <p>In the bad old days, New York reserved what we call Regents exams mainly for students who planned to go to college. But now we're going to test everybody -- the special ed students, the kids who arrived last week from Guatemala. And why not? Every child is important, and just because he or she is going to school in double shifts or studying science in a laboratory that was built when Teddy Roosevelt was a teen doesn't mean we don't care enough to demand the very best.</p>
        <p>None of this is necessarily as crazy as it seems. Some school officials seem to be setting themselves up for a standards debacle in hopes that when the great disaster finally occurs and kids start failing in droves, an outraged public will ante up the money for smaller classes, better-paid teachers, newer buildings, etc. The only problem with this theory is that a whole generation of students will wind up being used for cannon fodder.</p>
        <p>''Everybody's worried about the kids caught in the middle,'' says Abigail Thernstrom of the Massachusetts state board of education.</p>
        <p>To be fair to Mr. Bush, Texas is actually making an attempt to set the bar higher without whopping it over the heads of the children who happen to get caught in the transition. This year the teachers started getting additional training, and the students' skills are being tested regularly so those who start to fall behind can get special tutoring. A timetable that actually prepares kids for the standards they're supposed to meet is definitely not silly.</p>
        <p>Bragging about it as if anything has actually happened, however, is ridiculous.</p>
