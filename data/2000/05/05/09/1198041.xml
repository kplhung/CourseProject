        <p>Like Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, 180,000 American men will suddenly learn this year that they have prostate cancer, and what makes their decisions about treatment so difficult is that doctors do not know which one is most effective.</p>
        <p>Better information about survival and side effects may come from trials under way in Canada, Sweden and the United States, but not for several years. Until then, patients must rely on limited information, and wide variations in practice will occur.</p>
        <p>Alternatives include surgical removal of the prostate, radiation (delivered externally or implanted as ''seeds''), techniques to freeze and destroy the prostate, early hormonal therapy and watchful waiting. While there is no standard plan for such observation, it usually involves monitoring blood tests to determine if the prostate specific antigen level rises, rectal examinations to determine if prostate nodules develop and checking for developing symptoms.</p>
        <p>At this point, survival rates for all seem to be comparable but full scientific evaluation is lacking. Each therapy produces a spectrum of short-term and long-term complications and effects on quality of life, with no outcomes assured. Surveys show that doctors often report fewer post-therapy side effects than do patients.</p>
        <p>''We don't know what the best treatment option is for men who are found to have prostate cancer and doctors do not always clearly say that to patients,'' said Dr. Timothy J. Wilt, who is directing a national study on outcomes of prostate cancer treatments.</p>
        <p>Dr. John H. Wasson, an expert on health care delivery at Dartmouth, said there was no proof from scientifically controlled trials ''that any treatment is better than watchful waiting'' and then, if the cancer spreads, prescribing drugs to lower male hormones to make the cancer shrink or grow more slowly.</p>
        <p>Because prostate cancer is usually slow growing, doctors also do not know whether treating the cancer early, when confined to the prostate, improves length or quality of life compared with close monitoring.</p>
        <p>''The reason we don't know is because there have been no large head-to-head comparison trials of survival or complications,'' said Dr. Wilt, who is also a practicing internist at the University of Minnesota.</p>
        <p>The gold standard for determining a therapy's safety and effectiveness is the randomized controlled trial, with entrants assigned to a group receiving one therapy or to a second group receiving a different one, possibly a placebo, or dummy therapy.</p>
        <p>But the decision for early prostate cancer is ''complex and severely hampered'' by a lack of such trials, Dr. Mark Frydenberg of Melbourne wrote in The Medical Journal of Australia in May 1998.</p>
        <p>In such circumstances, doctors are often medical salesmen. Recommendations from each specialty tend to be mirror images: urologists generally advise surgery and radiation oncologists recommend radiation.</p>
        <p>For men with early prostate cancer as measured by low amounts of prostate specific antigen in the blood and low scores on the Gleason pathology test, early intervention with any option appears to provide an excellent chance for disease-free survival. But experts say they can also do extremely well with no therapy for years.</p>
        <p>People with higher P.S.A. levels and Gleason scores ''do not do well with observation, but their survival appears equally poor with early therapy,'' Dr. Wilt said. ''The question is: do they do better with any one of them.''</p>
        <p>Published studies based on various individual or group practices that looked at patients one year after they had prostate surgery showed rates of urinary incontinence ranging from 4 percent to 40 percent, and impotence from 29 percent to 75 percent.</p>
        <p>Using a different method and drawing on a broader group, cancer registries in six regions of this country, a team of scientists led by Dr. Janet L. Stanford of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle studied nearly 1,300 men after surgery for prostate cancer. Over all, at 18 months or longer after surgery, 8.4 percent of patients were incontinent. Of those, 11.9 percent were incontinent more than twice a day and 3.3 percent used three or more pads each day.</p>
        <p>In its report in The Journal of the American Medical Association last Jan. 19, the team also found that 59.9 percent of all of the men were impotent as measured by the inability to have erections firm enough for sexual intercourse.</p>
        <p>Rigorously controlled trials for prostate cancer have been difficult to do ''because everyone felt they knew the answer,'' said Dr. Wasson, of Dartmouth.</p>
        <p>Such committed positions delayed for decades the studies needed to document that many women with breast cancer could have lumpectomies rather than breast removal. Thus, when researchers started randomized trials, too few patients agreed to participate because they were convinced they knew the best treatment.</p>
        <p>However, three randomly controlled trials of men with early stage, slow and moderately growing prostate cancer are in progress.</p>
        <p>American and Swedish researchers are conducting two trials in several centers in each country to compare surgery to watchful waiting. One -- organized by the United States Department of Veterans Affairs, the National Cancer Institute and the Agency for Health Care Quality and Research -- began in 1995 but results will not be in for eight years.</p>
        <p>A third study from Canada is comparing external radiation and a technique to freeze the prostate known as cryotherapy.</p>
        <p>The new trials are needed because earlier ones were too small and their designs outdated. For example, two earlier controlled trials, each involving only about 100 men with early stage cancer, showed no differences in outcomes. The trials were conducted before the widespread use of the P.S.A. test and refinements in early therapy.</p>
        <p>In one study, the Veterans Administration compared surgery to watchful waiting and found no difference in survival after 23 years. ''It suggests that surgery is unlikely to have a large benefit,'' Dr. Wilt said.</p>
        <p>Another study, reported in 1982, suggested that cancer recurrence was more likely after radiation therapy than surgery. But radiation therapy has improved since then.</p>
        <p>Because of the uncertainty, experts have prepared videotapes to aid decision making. But these and other informational materials have found limited use in routine practice.</p>
        <p>Many doctors, particularly those in group practices, have a nurse tell patients what to expect in the recovery period. Even so, patients are often not told in advance that radiation is also needed in about 25 percent of men who had their prostates removed surgically because microscopic studies of the prostate found evidence of spread. In another 25 percent, a rise in P.S.A. level in the five years after prostate removal leads to further therapy, usually with drugs to lower levels of male hormones.</p>
        <p>In interviews, patients said that doctors often provided only general answers. And in a survey conducted in March by Roper Starch Worldwide and paid for by two drug companies, Amgen and Praecis, reported at a meeting of the American Urological Association last week, found that many urologists were not aware that their patients were experiencing diarrhea or constipation, hot flashes and other symptoms from cancer treatments.</p>
        <p>Also, doctors tend to overestimate what patients can do in the recovery period. Urologists not connected with Mayor Giuliani's case have said that if he chooses surgery, he could resume campaigning and flying three weeks later.</p>
        <p>But ''flying isn't the problem; walking through airports is,'' said Dr. David J. Kudzma, a physician in Miami who had surgery and radiation for prostate cancer. ''On the plane, you have to sit on the aisle, not too far from the lavatory.''</p>
