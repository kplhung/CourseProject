        <p>SHORE-Josselyn M. May 7, 2000, peacefully at age 96. Beloved husband of Irene Freeman Shore for 71 years. Cherished father of Winifred and Mike Freund and Freeman and Toni Shore. Adored grandfather of Jennifer and Michael Pardee, Mia and Ramsey Walker and Peter and Julie Strauss. Loving Pop-Pop of Benjamin and Jacob Pardee, Samantha and Abigail Walker, and Charles Strauss. Dear brother of the late Jessie Kramer, Sanford, Beatrice and Frederick Shore. He was larger than life and will live in our hearts forever. Services will be at 1 PM, Tuesday, May 9, at Temple Beth-El, Old Mill Rd., Great Neck. Family will be at 3 Davis Rd., Port Washington, Tuesday and Thursday from 5-8 PM and Wednesday, 530 East 86th St., NYC, from 5-8 PM. Contributions may be made to the Josselyn M. Shore Memorial Fund at Temple Beth-El.</p>
        <p>SHORE-Josselyn M. By now you're up there sprinting with Charlie Paddock and out-driving in ''The Babe.'' In life as in golf, you were always a ''whole''-in-one, of whichever spelling. As you had done so eloquently on past family occasions, we toast you now: Here's to you, Joss. You will be forever in our hearts. Seth and Barbara, Mark and Sarah, Laura and Lynn Bartner</p>
        <p>SHORE-Josselyn. Temple Beth El of Great Neck mourns the loss of its beloved past president. His leadership &amp; friendship were an inspiration to our congregation for many decades. We shall deeply miss encouraging words &amp; enthusiastic devotion to our temple &amp; faith. Shelley M. Limmer, President Jerome K. Davidson, Rabbi</p>
