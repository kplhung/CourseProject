        <p>A well-known commander of the disbanded Kosovo Liberation Army was shot and killed today outside his home in the southern town of Prizren as he headed to work.</p>
        <p>The reason behind the shooting of the former leader, Ekrem Rexha, was not immediately clear, although it was thought to be politically related given his years with the guerrilla army. The commander, who was better known by his war pseudonym, Commander Drini, had headed one of seven regional zones of the liberation army during its war against the Serbian military and police forces. And he also had served on the army's  general staff during the three-month  NATO bombing campaign. In his years with the liberation army, Commander Drini was aware that hard-line ethnic Albanian nationalists did not trust him or like the fact that he was ethnic Torbesh, or Muslim Slav.</p>
        <p>His death also comes just three weeks after the killing of another former K.L.A. commander and hero, Besim Mala, who was shot dead in a dispute with a business associate here in the capital of Kosovo. The argument and shooting, in which both men died, was over the ownership of a cafe in downtown Pristina.</p>
        <p>Nearly a year after K.L.A. guerrillas came down from the hills as NATO forces arrived and Serbian forces withdrew from Kosovo, old comrades in the liberation army are having major disagreements and even turning their guns on each other in local power struggles. And as the international administration in Kosovo prepares the province for local elections in October, many Albanians say they are afraid that a wave of political violence lies ahead.</p>
        <p>The Kosovo Liberation Army was disbanded under an agreement with the NATO-led peacekeeping mission in Kosovo. Since then, several thousand of its members have joined the liberation army's civilian successor and new police force, the Kosovo Protection Force. Many of the liberation army's former leaders have gone into business or politics and have become powerful figures in the community, profiting from cafes and other businesses they seized as the Serbs pulled out of Kosovo.</p>
        <p>After leaving the liberation army, Commander Drini had been working in the local administration in his hometown of Prizren as an environment and safety officer, and was thought to be aspiring to be the town's future mayor.</p>
        <p>A professional soldier and a former officer in the Communist-era Yugoslav People's Army, Commander Drini taught at the army's military staff college in Sarajevo. He fought in the Croatian army during that country's war and returned to his native Kosovo to join the liberation army in the late 1990's as the conflict there escalated.</p>
