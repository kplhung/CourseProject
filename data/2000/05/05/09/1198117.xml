        <p>After languishing for months in the shadow of their better-known, better-financed Democratic rivals, New Jersey's four Republican candidates for the United States Senate had their first debate today, with all four brandishing their conservative credentials while avoiding the harsh attacks they had leveled at each other in recent campaign mailings.</p>
        <p>With only regional political bases and limited name recognition, the four used the forum to make broad appeals to the 300,000 voters expected to decide the June 6 primary, describing their views in favor of tax cuts, free trade and severely limiting the use of American military troops abroad.</p>

        <p>After languishing for months in the shadow of their better-known, better-financed Democratic rivals, New Jersey's four Republican candidates for the United States Senate had their first debate today, with all four brandishing their conservative credentials while avoiding the harsh attacks they had leveled at each other in recent campaign mailings.</p>
        <p>With only regional political bases and limited name recognition, the four used the forum to make broad appeals to the 300,000 voters expected to decide the June 6 primary, describing their views in favor of tax cuts, free trade and severely limiting the use of American military troops abroad.</p>
        <p>The format did not allow for give-and-take during what was largely a genial debate, with the candidates mentioning each other's names only when they agreed on various issues. Their only critical words were aimed at Democrats, specifically President Clinton and New Jersey's two Democratic Senate contenders, Jim Florio and Jon S. Corzine.</p>
        <p>Representative Robert D. Franks, a four-term congressman from Union County, called himself a common-sense conservative and said that he and fellow Republicans in Congress deserved credit for the robust economy because they had helped ''to drag Bill Clinton kicking and screaming down the path to fiscal responsibility.''</p>
        <p>James W. Treffinger, the Essex County executive, described himself as an ''unabashed conservative'' and proposed replacing the income tax code with a flat tax.</p>
        <p>William L. Gormley, a state senator from Ocean County, said he was a fiscal conservative because he had voted for 37 tax cuts since Gov. Christine Todd Whitman took office in 1994. In an unusual move for a contestant in a Republican primary, however, Mr. Gormley also said he had become a target for the National Rifle Association because he was the only Republican state legislator to vote for New Jersey's assault weapons ban in 1990.</p>
        <p>The most conservative candidate in the race is Murray Sabrin, a college finance professor who ran for governor as a Libertarian in 1993. Mr. Sabrin called for the abolition of affirmative action, the Departments of Education, Energy, and Housing and Urban Development, the capital gains tax and the estate tax. When asked whether his platform might be too extreme for New Jersey's historically moderate Republican voters, he beamed. ''That's what they said about Ronald Wilson Reagan in 1980,'' Mr. Sabrin said.</p>
        <p>The debate, sponsored jointly by The New York Times and The New Jersey Network, was taped at 1 p.m. and broadcast at 9 p.m. The Democratic candidates are scheduled to hold their first debate on Thursday, and both debates will be broadcast back-to-back on Sunday at 2 p.m. The Democrats have agreed to four debates before the primary. The Republicans are scheduled to hold two more.</p>
        <p>The tranquil tone of today's debate was a departure from the increasingly heated campaign. In recent weeks, Mr. Gormley's campaign has called Mr. Franks a ''Clinton Republican,'' saying that the congressman voted to impeach the president but days later urged the Senate not to remove him from office. Mr. Franks has branded Mr. Gormley a ''Florio Republican,'' and accused him of cooperating too closely with Mr. Florio during his four years as governor.</p>
        <p>As if bracing for such a criticism, Mr. Gormley began the debate with a one-minute opening statement in which he described his votes against Mr. Florio's tax increase. But an attack from Mr. Franks never came. Instead, Mr. Franks talked of his own efforts, when he was a state legislator and Republican state chairman, to block Mr. Florio's 1990 income tax increase and deny his re-election.</p>
        <p>Mr. Treffinger predicted that Mr. Corzine's programs would bankrupt the country. Referring to Mr. Florio's $2.8-billion tax increase, he said, ''There are at least 2.8 billion reasons not to vote for Jim Florio.''</p>
        <p>However, most of the debate emphasized the similarities between Mr. Treffinger, Mr. Gormley and Mr. Franks. All three said they favored limited gun control, campaign finance reform, expanding trade relations with China and federal tax credits to help working families afford health care and higher education.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks and Mr. Gormley described issues in which they broke ranks with their party leadership. Mr. Franks said he defied Republican leaders in the House of Representatives when he voted to support campaign finance and the patients' bill of rights.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gormley described his vote for Mr. Florio's assault weapon ban as an act of conscience.</p>
        <p>''I had the opportunity as a United States marine to fire an M-16, and I know what damage they can do,'' Mr. Gormley said. ''We need to send a message to the N.R.A., and the special interest groups who don't care about our children and don't care about the future of our state, to tell them we're not going to stand for it.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 10, 2000, Wednesday  An article yesterday about the first debate by New Jersey's four Republican candidates for United States Senate misidentified the county represented by one of them, State Senator William L. Gormley. He is from Atlantic County, not Ocean County.</p>
        <p>The article also misstated the year in which another candidate, Murray Sabrin, ran for governor as a Libertarian. It was 1997, not 1993.</p>
