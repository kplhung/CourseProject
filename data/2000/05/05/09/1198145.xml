        <p>Stop. Just stop. Cease and desist. Enough already. Let the concern and consternation over the increase in home runs and runs end here and now. Instead of tearing out the hair and gnashing the teeth, sit back and relax and enjoy what we have. It's a new era for baseball.</p>
        <p>It has happened before. The advent of Babe Ruth marked the beginning of an era that made baseball the country's sport of choice. Without Ruth and the home runs he produced, baseball would have withered and died eons ago. If an escalation of the Ruthian experience is occurring now, let it be. Don't look for ways to stifle it.</p>

        <p>Stop. Just stop. Cease and desist. Enough already. Let the concern and consternation over the increase in home runs and runs end here and now. Instead of tearing out the hair and gnashing the teeth, sit back and relax and enjoy what we have. It's a new era for baseball.</p>
        <p>It has happened before. The advent of Babe Ruth marked the beginning of an era that made baseball the country's sport of choice. Without Ruth and the home runs he produced, baseball would have withered and died eons ago. If an escalation of the Ruthian experience is occurring now, let it be. Don't look for ways to stifle it.</p>
        <p>Fans evidently don't find fault with the outbreak of scoring. Attendance is up 5.8 percent over last year, and they may attend games this season in record numbers. That possible development is what Major League Baseball anticipates, at least, so why would anyone want to do anything to take away from the fans something they appear to like.</p>
        <p>''Our fans are enjoying it,'' Commissioner Bud Selig said yesterday. ''Did we design this? No. We aren't that smart. We ought to watch it and analyze it, but is it necessarily bad? No.''</p>
        <p>Last Friday night about 39,000 fans sat at The Ballpark in Arlington and watched a game that could become the signature event of the new era. Oakland led Texas, 15-7, after six and a half innings, but the Rangers won the game, 17-16, scoring 10 runs in the last three innings. The fans who were there were ecstatic and will talk about the game for months, if not years, to come. No one asked for his money back. It was 4 hours 1 minute of great entertainment.</p>
        <p>The purists, of course, cringed. The purists, however, are not paying the players' inflated salaries.</p>
        <p>Teams played 457 games in the first five weeks of the season. They averaged 10.76 runs and 2.59 home runs a game. Pitchers compiled a 4.96 earned run average in that period.</p>
        <p>Conspiracy theorists suspect that the ball has been doctored to make it easier for batters to hit it out of the park. The fact is home runs and runs have increased nearly every year since the first of two expansions that added four teams in the 1990's. In 1992, the year before the first expansion, teams averaged 8.39 runs and 1.45 home runs a game, and pitchers compiled a 3.80 E.R.A. in the first 457 games.</p>
        <p>With the postexpansion proliferation of scoring and home run hitting, new standards have to be established. The new era, for example, needs a new E.R.A. A 3.00 earned run average used to be considered good for a pitcher. With the average E.R.A. up by about a third, that standard has to be raised to 4.00.</p>
        <p>Last season the American League had only eight starting pitchers at 4.00 or lower. Pitchers are the players who are affected most adversely in the new era. For the most part, they are fodder for hitters who have become stronger and in parks that have become smaller.</p>
        <p>Roy Halladay is supposed to be a good young pitcher for Toronto, but in seven starts this season he has an 11.53 E.R.A. Jose Lima, a 21-game winner for Houston last year, has a 9.53 E.R.A. in seven starts and has been battered for a major league-high 16 home runs.</p>
        <p>It is middle relief pitchers, though, who deserve hazard pay for their efforts. With pitching staffs short on talent generally, if the starter is knocked out early, his departure triggers a parade of ineffective relievers who should still be learning their craft in the minor leagues or who never demonstrated enough ability to pitch in the majors.</p>
        <p>Tanyon Sturtze is a reliever for the White Sox whose professional career spanned the 1990's. In that decade, he spent all but 110 playing days in the minors. This season, in eight relief appearances and one start (last night against Boston) he has a 10:43 E.R.A. covering 142/3 innings.</p>
        <p>Home run standards, too, must be raised because of inflation. From 1976 until 1995, excluding the strike seasons of 1981 and 1994, the American and National League home run champions averaged 42 home runs. In the last five seasons, their successors have hit an average of 53 home runs a year. Using that 26 percent inflation rate, if 30 home runs had been considered a benchmark for sluggers, that number should now be at least 38, if not 40.</p>
        <p>Baseball's new era, however, has not eliminated low-scoring games. This season has already produced seven 1-0 games and 14 2-1 games. Boston has lost a pair of 1-0 decisions; Los Angeles suffered two 1-0 losses in consecutive games with different teams. Cleveland lost two consecutive 2-1 games to different teams. The Mets have won three 2-1 decisions.</p>
        <p>Each day or set of days can still produce vastly different results. Colorado scored 43 runs in three games against Montreal last week, then went to San Francisco and was shut out twice in two games.</p>
        <p>A premium is placed on good pitching more than ever in the new era. But the success of Pedro Martinez (1.22), Randy Johnson (0.93), Tom Glavine (1.73) and some others shows that hitters haven't assumed command completely.</p>
        <p>''Are Pedro Martinez and Randy Johnson using a different ball?'' Selig asked. ''Of course not.''</p>
        <p>Baseball officials are nevertheless studying developments in the new era. They are having the balls tested, they will go to Costa Rica and tour the Rawlings factory where the balls are made, they will study bats, they are considering raising the mound in a couple of rookie minor leagues to see what effect such a change could have on hitting.</p>
        <p>Officials met yesterday with Rawlings people, who for the 972nd time vowed that they had made no change in the balls. If that is so, let the new era continue and take baseball wherever Mark McGwire and friends lead it. Just leave a few 1-0 games around for old times' sake.</p>
