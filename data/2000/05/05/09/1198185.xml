        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re your May 6 front-page article about people's moving to places like New Jersey to avail themselves of the generous support given to children with autism: I was in the position for my 30 years on a child study team in New Jersey to take part in these placements. While I acknowledge the high cost to the various districts, this expense does have the potential to save the cost of institutionalizing these children.</p>
        <p>But the real effect of the federal law protecting the disabled is the abuse of services demanded by parents of nonhandicapped students.</p>

        <p>But the real effect of the federal law protecting the disabled is the abuse of services demanded by parents of nonhandicapped students.</p>
        <p>That is to say, students who exhibit less severe learning disabilities for which a diagnosis of auditory processing or attention deficit disorder can be made are classified and serviced to the limits of the law.</p>
        <p>The number of truly disabled students is far less than the number of those classified and receiving services without justification.</p>
