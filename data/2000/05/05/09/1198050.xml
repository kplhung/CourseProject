        <p>Ulcerative colitis, a serious disease in which the lining of the colon and rectum become inflamed, causing severe pain, appears to be worsened by long-term stress, a new study has found.</p>
        <p>Doctors have long theorized that stress can play a role in the disease, but have never been able to prove it, said the researchers, writing in the May issue of The American Journal of Gastroenterology.</p>
        <p>The problem, they said, was that past research looked at short-term stress, with the expectation that a flare-up would be seen within a month or two. Instead, the researchers concluded, after examining 62 patients in Italy for six years, it is longer-term stress, measuring as long as two years, that seems to play a role.</p>
        <p>They emphasized, though, that stress was only one factor and that no one really could explain the course of the chronic disease, which goes in and out of remission.</p>
