        <p>Celestial Traveler  When France voted This year for the best book of the 20th century, the winner was ''The Little Prince.'' Published in 1943 Antoine de Saint-Exupery's internationally beloved parable about the little prince who leaves his tiny planet in search of what is really important still sells a million copies a year. Saint-Exupery (1900-1944) wrote the book in a rented house near Northport on Long Island in the summer and fall of 1942 before returning to service as a reconnaissance pilot in World War II. In 1968 the Morgan Library acquired the most complete record of the creation of ''The Little Prince,'' including drawings omitted when the book was published. To celebrate the centenary of Saint-Exupery's birth, some 20 of the author's original preparatory drawings and pages from his revised handwritten manuscript go on view today through Aug. 20.</p>
        <p>Encore  The Royal Shakespeare Company, featured in seven seasons at the Brooklyn Academy of Music since 1971, is paying a return three-week visit. The contribution from Shakespeare is ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' in six performances from May 21 to 27. The opening attraction, for four performances tomorrow through Saturday, is a rarity, T. S. Eliot's verse drama ''The Family Reunion,'' directed by the Royal Shakespeare Company's artistic director, Adrian Noble. Between Eliot and Shakespeare, for five performances May 16 to 20, is Friedrich Schiller's historical drama ''Don Carlos.''</p>

        <p>Through a Lens  O. Winston Link won fame for his Norfolk and Western Railway series of photographs from 1955 to 1960 capturing with beauty and sensitivity the final days of the last major fully steam-powered rail line in the United States. What better setting for an exhibition of over 50 of his photographs than the New York Transit Museum Gallery in Grand Central Terminal? ''Bridges and Rails: Photographs by O. Winston Link,'' through Sept. 30, also includes the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge under construction in 1963 and 1964 and an unpublished photo essay, ''Triborough From High Places,'' 1965 to 1968.</p>
        <p>Gratitude  Thank you. That's the message from the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center to the people of New York. But the gratitude goes beyond words. At Alice Tully Hall, Friday through May 23, the society is presenting as a gift to the city its quartet in residence, the Orion String Quartet, in ''Beethoven 2000,'' with six free concerts traversing Beethoven's string quartets. Ticket distribution began on Saturday at the hall.</p>
