        <p>The cost of financing is on the rise for consumers and companies.</p>
        <p>The benchmark fixed interest rate on 30-year home mortgages, at 8.65 percent, is the highest since early 1995, and the yields on junk bonds, at an average of 12.79 percent, are well above their levels then. Corporate bond yields, at 8.89 percent, are also approaching early 1995 marks.</p>
        <p>These are all signs that the Federal Reserve's interest rate increases, five moves of a quarter-point since last June, are beginning to have an impact on the financial markets.</p>
        <p>But the higher rates have not yet led to a significant drag on the overall economy, in part because market rates have risen to their five-year highs very recently and in part because stocks have been strong enough that consumers have not been discouraged. Although growth has slowed somewhat since the fourth quarter of 1999, the economy grew at a 5.4 percent annual rate in the first quarter of 2000. And in the most significant data since then, 340,000 jobs were created last month as the unemployment rate fell to a 30-year low of 3.9 percent, the government said on Friday.</p>
        <p>This lack of bite in monetary policy, even more than recent suggestions of some inflationary pressure in wages, has led many analysts to predict that the Fed will push up its target for short-term interest rates much further then the current 6 percent before the economy will slow to an acceptable pace. With Fed policy makers scheduled to meet next Tuesday, the debate has shifted to whether they will raise their target rate by half a percentage point instead of the familiar quarter-point steps.</p>
        <p>A recent rise in the yield on the futures contract of federal funds shows that many investors expect the central bank's target rate to be 7 percent by November.</p>
        <p>The Fed has moved cautiously until now partly because it saw few signs of inflationary pressure other than the spurt in crude oil and gasoline prices.</p>
        <p>Laurence H. Meyer, a Fed governor, said in a speech last month that ''the current episode is the smallest and most gradual tightening'' since the late 1960's. ''So the modest effects on aggregate demand to date,'' he said, ''perhaps only confirm the relatively modest and extremely gradual nature of the current tightening.''</p>
        <p>In addition, Mr. Meyer said, ''some developments suggest that the recent policy moves may have had a more limited effect on aggregate demand than would have been expected.''</p>
        <p>To measure the impact of monetary policy, one has to look at what effect a rise in the federal funds rate, which is the rate on overnight loans between banks, has on broader financial conditions including interest rates, stock prices and the dollar's exchange rate. Mr. Meyer said one gauge, the Goldman Sachs financial conditions index, ''is not only at the very low end of historical experience, but is nearly unchanged'' since June.</p>
        <p>''So a second conclusion about the current experience,'' Mr. Meyer said, ''is that the increase in the funds rate, to date, has had a smaller effect than usual -- nearly zero -- on overall financial conditions and hence on aggregate demand.''</p>
        <p>Comparisons to the Fed's last episode of tightening help make the point. From February 1994 to March 1995, policy makers raised the federal funds rate target to 6 percent from 3 percent. By December 1994, new mortgage applications had fallen 20.3 percent from their year-earlier level, according to John Lonski, senior economist at Moody's Investors Service.</p>
        <p>Rather than slowing, the rate has increased recently. New applications rose 9.2 percent in the 12-month period ending in April, despite the increase in the interest rate on a 30-year Fannie Mae mortgage to 8.65 percent from 6.90 percent during that time.</p>
        <p>Even though mortgage and corporate rates are rising, they have not yet reached the high points of the 1994-95 Fed tightening. The Fannie Mae 30-year rate reached 9.29 percent in December 1994. The rate on long-term industrial company bonds rated by Moody's as Baa, its lowest investment-grade rating, reached 9.37 percent in November 1994. (But the yields on bonds below investment grade -- junk bonds in market parlance -- are more than three-quarters of a percentage point higher than their 11.98 percent peak in January 1995, according to Chase Manhattan's high-yield index.)</p>
        <p>Probably the most important reason that the Fed's interest rate increases have had little impact is that stocks in general have not crumbled, another factor noted by Mr. Meyer. ''Equity prices have been unusually resilient in this episode,'' he said, ''rising by an amount near the maximum during the first nine months of significant tightenings over the period studied.'' While the Dow Jones industrial average is down 3.3 percent since the end of June 1999, the Nasdaq composite index is up 36.6 percent, and the Wilshire 5000, which includes all domestic stocks, is up 5.4 percent.</p>
        <p>William Dudley, chief United States economist at Goldman, Sachs, said yesterday that the central bank would have to raise the Fed funds target to 7.5 percent next year, which means an additional 1.5 percentage points, to slow the economy. Like several economists, he raised his projection last week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dudley said the Fed's moves so far have had so little impact because ''the bond and stock markets are so trusting'' of Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve's chairman. Investors, he said, believe that the Fed will keep inflation in check, but not push interest rates so high as to cause a recession. ''So they are not worried about inflation and they are not worried about a hard landing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Neil M. Soss, chief United States economist at Credit Suisse First Boston, said, ''we haven't seen much effect in the real economy yet'' because consumers, who have powered much of this record economic expansion, have not received a signal from the financial markets to slow down.</p>
        <p>But the surge in mortgage rates in the last two weeks, to 8.65 percent from 8.09 percent, he said, may show that the Fed's message is finally coming through.</p>
