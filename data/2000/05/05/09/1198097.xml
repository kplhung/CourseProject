        <p>As the Congressional vote on permanent normalized trade relations for China draws closer, Vice President Al Gore is stepping up his activities to promote it.</p>
        <p>He spoke more forcefully yesterday for the agreement than he usually does. And today he plans to attend a White House meeting with President Clinton and former Presidents Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, among others, to lobby for the measure, which Congress is to vote on later this month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has been tepid in his support so far for the agreement, largely because organized labor, which backs him, opposes it. But speaking up for it serves Mr. Gore's political purposes now by helping to counter the impression, reinforced during the controversy over Elian Gonzalez, that he does not take principled stands and instead panders to those whose support he seeks.</p>
        <p>At the annual meeting of Associated Press publishers and editors yesterday in New York, Mr. Gore did not raise the China issue, but was asked about it in a question-and-answer session. Uncharacteristically, he delved into the reasons he believed the trade bill should pass; normally, when he mentions the issue at all, he gives it fairly short shrift.</p>
        <p>''This doesn't reduce any U.S. tariffs; it only reduces Chinese tariffs,'' he said at the Associated Press meeting, which was held at St. Bartholomew's Church in Midtown Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''If we turned it down,'' he added, referring to the World Trade Organization, ''it wouldn't keep China from coming into the W.T.O.; China would come into the W.T.O. anyway.''</p>
        <p>Failing to approve the trade agreement, he said, would not hurt China but would put the United States at a ''severe disadvantage'' with its own trading partners.</p>
        <p>Today, the vice president will appear in the East Room at the White House with President Clinton, former Presidents Ford and Carter, and two former secretaries of state, Henry A. Kissinger and James A. Baker III.</p>
        <p>A White House spokesman, Jim Kennedy, said that former President George Bush, the father of Mr. Gore's Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, was invited, but ''due to a scheduling conflict, he is not able to attend.'' Governor Bush supports the trade agreement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's commitment to the matter has been in some doubt since he won the endorsement of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. last fall. He said then that he supported it, leading two of the organization's most powerful members, the Teamsters and the United Auto Workers, to withhold their endorsement of his candidacy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has tried to win over James P. Hoffa, president of the Teamsters union, but Mr. Hoffa, who is up for re-election and faces his own internal politics, has recently expressed more interest in the third-party candidacy of Patrick J. Buchanan, who also opposes the treaty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has said he has called some members of Congress to push them to support the treaty, but has not said how many. Aides say he has made calls from his campaign plane and from his office and that if the vice president did not want to appear in the East Room today, he would not do so, suggesting that he sees some political benefit in standing with President Clinton on an issue that the administration has advanced as important to the economy.</p>
