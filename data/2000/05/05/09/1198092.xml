        <p>General Motors, which has struggled for years to make its cars less boring, announced today that it had hired a star designer who helped transform Renault from an also-ran in the European auto industry into one of the industry's most feared competitors.</p>
        <p>The designer, Anne Asensio, 37, is widely thought to be the most important influence in three of Renault's biggest hits of the 1990's: the small, quirky Scenic minivan and the Clio and Twingo small cars. The Scenic in particular has given Renault some standing as an innovative automaker, becoming the best-selling vehicle in Britain despite the longstanding suspicion with which many Britons view French products. Scenic is the first non-British vehicle to achieve the top ranking there.</p>

        <p>General Motors, which has struggled for years to make its cars less boring, announced today that it had hired a star designer who helped transform Renault from an also-ran in the European auto industry into one of the industry's most feared competitors.</p>
        <p>The designer, Anne Asensio, 37, is widely thought to be the most important influence in three of Renault's biggest hits of the 1990's: the small, quirky Scenic minivan and the Clio and Twingo small cars. The Scenic in particular has given Renault some standing as an innovative automaker, becoming the best-selling vehicle in Britain despite the longstanding suspicion with which many Britons view French products. Scenic is the first non-British vehicle to achieve the top ranking there.</p>
        <p>Ms. Asensio has been the director of medium-car design and the third-ranking designer over all at Renault. She was considered in line to run Renault's design department some day. At G.M., she will hold a new position as director of advanced automobile design, overseeing the eight brand-design managers who come up with future models for various G.M. divisions like Cadillac, Chevrolet and Buick.</p>
        <p>She will report to Wayne Cherry, the G.M. vice president for design, and will be the highest-ranking woman ever in the G.M. design department. But she will rank below Jerry Palmer, the executive director of design, who also reports to Mr. Cherry and who oversees design changes to models currently in production.</p>
        <p>Whether Ms. Asensio can breathe life into G.M.'s designs will depend on further progress in changes that are already under way. In the early and mid-90's, company leaders were intent on restoring financial stability and tended to choose cautious designs that were supported by large committees of designers relying on extensive market research. But G.M. has begun experimenting, and has committed itself to building six of the nine well-received concept vehicles shown at the Detroit and New York auto shows this year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cherry said he admired Renault's aggressive designs. ''The thing I appreciate about Renault's style is they've taken risks, and most designers admire that,'' he said. ''They've dared to bring out some different vehicles.''</p>
        <p>G.M. wants to show similar imagination, Mr. Cherry said, adding, ''There's a renewed emphasis here from top management on design.''</p>
        <p>A Renault spokesman said that the company had other designers to replace Ms. Asensio and that G.M.'s decision to hire her ''shows the quality of design at Renault.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Asensio became well known in design circles at a young age. She graduated at the top of her class from France's top design school, said Carl L. Olsen, a former design director at Citroen who was one of the school's outside examiners. ''It was obvious immediately that she had a very exciting career in front of her,'' Mr. Olsen said.</p>
        <p>The hallmark of her designs at Renault has been the efficient use of space inside vehicles. The Scenic, which is not sold in the United States, is roomy on the inside but shorter than American minivans, making it easier to park on crowded European streets.</p>
        <p>''You really have to have a minimum amount of space on the road and a maximum amount of space in the car,'' she said in a telephone interview today from Paris.</p>
        <p>Ms. Asensio said she knew what it meant to move from Paris to Detroit. She was a student here for a year in 1987 at the Center for Creative Studies, one of the world's top automotive design schools, and returned for a year in 1990 when Renault and Chrysler collaborated on a sport utility vehicle design that never went into production. She designed the first Scenic right after her return to Paris.</p>
        <p>''I know Detroit, I know it's very different than Paris, but the G.M. offer is very interesting to me,'' she said, adding that she had been fascinated when G.M. showed its latest concept vehicles at the Geneva auto show in March. ''I'm more interested in the job than in the town.''</p>
