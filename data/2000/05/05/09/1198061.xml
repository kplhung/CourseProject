        <p>In this land of musical effervescence and, lately, political uproar, a silence spoke louder than either after an account of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony by Sir Simon Rattle and the Vienna Philharmonic this evening. The performance, at which the audience had been asked not to applaud, took place at the quarry of a former Nazi camp here, 120 miles east of Vienna. And although it had been in planning stages for four years, mostly without opposition, it recently became a hot issue.</p>
        <p>Critics of the idea said it trivialized an infamous slaughterhouse of the Holocaust and demeaned the memory of those who died here. Others labeled the Philharmonic's action merely as ineffectual given the rise of Jorg Haider and his pugnacious right-wing Freedom Party. And the strongest opposition came from survivors of the Mauthausen camp and its dozens of satellites throughout Austria, and those who claimed to speak for them.</p>
        <p>''They want to keep it a holy place,'' said Leon Zelman, 73, the director of the Jewish Welcome Service of Vienna, which helps refugees revisit the country they once fled. Mr. Zelman, a survivor himself, hatched the notion of such a concert in 1995 to call attention to a part of Austrian history too often studiously ignored, in hopes that the effort would serve as a bridge to a more enlightened future in the signal year 2000.</p>
        <p>To a viewer, however slightly aware of its history, the quarry looks even today like the unholiest of holy places. At one end a curving stone staircase, broad, rough and steep, rises 186 steps. Prisoners were endlessly forced to lug heavy stones up the steps, sometimes only to be arbitrarily pushed back down to their deaths. Their captors possessed a hellish repertory of lethal means: gas, gunshots, medical ''experiments,'' overwork, undernourishment. In all some 105,000 died at Mauthausen: Jews, non-Jews from all over Eastern Europe and elsewhere, homosexuals, Communists, ''antisocials.''</p>
        <p>Any concerned parties who stayed away from the music on principle should know, at least, that there was nothing of the circus about it. A minor problem was simply choosing the word to describe what transpired. ''Event'' itself was not good, tending to convey to German speakers the notion of spectacle.</p>
        <p>''Do not come expecting a concert,'' Mr. Zelman had said, and everyone agreed that this was not really a concert, although Clemens Hellsberg, a violinist and the president of the Vienna Philharmonic, reverted to that formulation in introductory remarks at the quarry. Earlier, at a news conference, he had suggested that ritual might be a better term.</p>
        <p>Whatever the case, it began with addresses: by Elisabeth Orth, an Austrian actress committed to Zelmanian causes and the host of the evening, which was broadcast live on video screens in major cities and slightly delayed on national television; by Thomas Klestil, the president of Austria, and Franz Fischler, a member of the European Commission, who had signed on as patrons; by proxy from the author and Holocaust survivor Elie Wiesel, who canceled his plans to attend as a protest against Mr. Haider; and by Mr. Hellsberg.</p>
        <p>The evening continued with Jewish prayers of mourning: Kaddish, recited by Paul Chaim Eisenberg, the chief rabbi of Vienna; and ''El Moleh Rachamim,'' sung by Samuel Barzilai, the chief cantor, accompanied by members of the Vienna Philharmonic and the Wiener Singverein.</p>
        <p>This prayer was arranged for six string players by Erich Schagerl, a violinist in the orchestra. ''We also wanted to demonstrate that we identify with this part of the program,'' Mr. Hellsberg said in an earlier conversation.</p>
        <p>Still, the very presence of the Vienna Philharmonic, with its own dark history, on such an occasion was a problem for some. ''The Philharmonic is part of the history of Austria,'' Mr. Zelman acknowledged.</p>
        <p>Just how integral a part is made clear with the coincidental publication in the United States of ''Alma Rose: Vienna to Auschwitz,'' by Richard Newman, a music critic and journalist in Canada. The protagonist, it may be recalled from Fania Fenelon's book, ''Playing for Time,'' or from a CBS film of that name, became the leader of a women's orchestra in Auschwitz-Birkenau, where she died at 37, probably from botulism.</p>
        <p>Inevitably the book also tells the story of her father, Arnold Rose, who had been a revered concertmaster of the Vienna Philharmonic for 57 years before being unceremoniously dismissed with the other Jewish players on the day of the Austrian Anschluss in 1938. By the end of the war 50 percent of the members of the orchestra were Nazis, said Werner Resel, a cellist of the Philharmonic and Mr. Hellsberg's immediate predecessor as president.</p>
        <p>But it was Mr. Zelman's close friendship with members of the orchestra, including Mr. Resel and Mr. Hellsberg, that gave shape to the idea in the first place. And Mr. Zelman argues forcibly that the sins of the fathers should not be visited on the present players.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hellsberg, who is also the orchestra's archivist and the author of an unsparing history, ''Demokratie der Konige'' (''Democracy of Kings''), expanded on the evening's basic purpose in his address. ''We wished to think of those members of the Philharmonic who were victims of the Nazis,'' he said. ''They were our predecessors, royal and imperial court musicians, highly decorated professors and teachers at the academy, highly respected artists who were humiliated, driven to death or murdered. We want to pay our respects to them by performing a work that they often performed under the leading conductors of their times.''</p>
        <p>And that work, Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, was the final bone of contention, chiefly because of its use of Schiller's ''Ode to Joy'' in the finale. The planners fastened chiefly on the text's visionary passages, like ''Alle Menschen werden Bruder'' (''All men become brothers''). But yes, there was joy: even if, for Beethoven, a joy hard won, as Sir Simon, the conductor, pointed out at the news conference, elaborating on his description in a printed statement of the work's journey from ''deepest darkness to fellowship, generosity and light.''</p>
        <p>Evasions were available, like the too easy text alteration that Leonard Bernstein used at the Berlin Wall in 1989, substituting ''Freiheit'' (''freedom'') for ''Freude'' (''joy''). But Sir Simon and the orchestra were surely right in making no such compromises.</p>
        <p>Because it was done outdoors and rather crudely amplified, and because of all the emotional and even moral overtones accruing in the quarry, it was easier to evaluate the run-up performance of the work on Sunday morning, at the orchestra's splendid home in the Musikverein. Sir Simon led a dynamic performance, and the amateur Singverein improbably matched the orchestra at every turn. The performance swept all before it.</p>
        <p>And if the two male vocal soloists shone in particular, it may have been because each found intense personal meaning in the occasion. ''It's inevitably a very important thing, a very political thing for me, since if I had been born in that time, I'd be dead,'' said Thomas Quasthoff, the German baritone, who was born with severe bodily deformities because of his mother's use of Thalidomide during pregnancy. ''There's no reason to say more.''</p>
        <p>Vinson Cole, the American tenor, reasoned likewise from farther on the periphery: ''It didn't happen all that many years ago. And being African-American, if I had been born 70 years ago in this country -- of course, I wouldn't have been born in this country -- I wouldn't be here now.''</p>
        <p>At the evening performance the audience of 11,000 was asked to refrain from applause, and against all odds it did. The silence was overwhelmingly eloquent, showing respect and awe for the occasion. Even the birds in the surrounding trees, which had been singing their own joyous songs throughout, were quiet.</p>
        <p>Candles, which had been distributed to all, were lighted onstage, and in the audience, where many had already been illuminated during the anthem to brotherhood. The stage emptied in sustained silence.</p>
        <p>In the end for all those who stayed away on principle, many others were present: survivors and their family members as well as Americans who had taken part in the liberation of 1945. Thomas Chris Nicolla, once a machine-gunner in the 11th Armored Division and now a civil engineer from New York, gave sobering details of conditions at Mauthausen and the satellite camps, where American troops liberated the emaciated and brutalized survivors.</p>
        <p>''At 18, I was naive and thought that if I went too far in one direction, I'd fall off the earth,'' said Stanley J. Marcus, another returning veteran, now a management consultant from Old Tappan, N.J. ''By 19, having seen what I saw, I was an old man. But we all survived for a reason, to be witnesses.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 15, 2000, Monday  Because of an editing error, an Arts Abroad article on Tuesday about two performances by the Vienna Philharmonic, one held at the site of a former concentration camp, misstated the location of the camp, at Mauthausen, Austria. It is 120 miles west of Vienna, not east.</p>
