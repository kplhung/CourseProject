        <p>About a half-hour before the team bus pulled away Sunday morning, Patrick Ewing folded his 7-foot frame into the back of a taxi and rode off with a rehabilitation specialist by his side.</p>
        <p>Ewing was on his way to American Airlines Arena, en route to Game 1 against the Miami Heat, to receive yet another treatment for the back spasms that left him nearly unable to walk when they first occurred Friday.</p>
        <p>Adding to a long list of things Ewing is not afraid of -- like Chicago and Michael Jordan, heights and tight spaces -- he does not have a fear of needles, either. He had an acupuncture session two hours before tip-off.</p>
        <p>Whatever it takes to play. If necessary, he will go through the same process before the Knicks try to even the four-of-seven-game, second-round series in Game 2 on Tuesday night in Miami. Today, Ewing sat on the sideline after practice, his body parts packed as deep as Champagne bottles in ice, and answered the question: Why?</p>
        <p>Why put himself through all this?</p>
        <p>''I enjoy playing,'' Ewing said before he asked a trainer to wrap his back with a bigger bandage. ''When I finish playing, I want to leave with a ring. The most important thing is I enjoy doing it. I enjoy waking up and practicing. I enjoy playing against the best players in the world. It feels good.</p>
        <p>''Who in this league doesn't play with any pain or nagging nicks? We all play with it. The question is: Can you go out and perform at a high level like that? I think that I can.''</p>
        <p>Considering the state of his scratch-and-dent-sale body, he did remarkably well in Game 1. He played 40 minutes, scored 17 points, grabbed 9 rebounds and blocked a shot. But the issue isn't his statistics; it's his mobility. It's how the Heat drove fearlessly into the paint for uncontested layups, how languid Ewing was in transition, how difficult it was for him to prevent Alonzo Mourning from taking over the game at the end.</p>
        <p>In the fourth quarter, Mourning, who scored 10 of 26 points in the final eight minutes of the game, was able to get position deep in the post against Ewing for an easy layup. And he was able to bolt outside of a late-arriving Ewing for a key jumper.</p>
        <p>''Alonzo had a great game, especially down the stretch,'' Ewing said. ''He got the ball deep and was able to make plays. I have to do a better job.''</p>
        <p>But Ewing was not the root of the Knicks' problems on Sunday. Even if he is more mobile in Game 2, he won't be the cure-all, either. There were other issues -- some relating to Ewing and some not -- that led to the loss on Sunday. Today, Coach Jeff Van Gundy outlined the three areas that need most improving.</p>
        <p>''First, we didn't start the game with the intensity we'd talked about all week,'' Van Gundy said. ''There was a discernible difference between Toronto in the first quarter and the first quarter yesterday. They shot 60 percent, and outrebounded us, 16-7. They were 8 for 8 on layups, and we never fouled them once. Two, we didn't fight for the ball as much as we need to. And three, we didn't pass the ball like we had to pass to shoot the percent we need to shoot to win down the stretch.''</p>
        <p>In the fourth quarter, the Knicks totaled only four assists. Even though they had the Heat in the penalty with seven minutes left in the game, the Knicks didn't drive but instead launched quick jumpers early in the shot clock. And they didn't work the ball into Ewing. After he made his first two shots in the fourth quarter, he didn't touch the ball for the last nine minutes of the game.</p>
        <p>Part of the Knicks' problem was the way the Heat sealed off Ewing. Part of it was sloppy ball-handling.  Without the ball in his hands, Ewing could only make a difference with his defense. But with his body weighed down with injuries, with Van Gundy choosing to leave him one-on-one in coverage, Ewing couldn't prevent Mourning's run.</p>
        <p>''I'm playing, I'm playing,'' Ewing said. ''I've always had bangs and bumps. I've always had ice on my knees and other parts of my body. That's part of basketball. That's part of life. The only thing I'm concerned about is that tomorrow, at 8 p.m., I feel good.''</p>
