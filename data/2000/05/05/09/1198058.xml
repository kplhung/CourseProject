        <p>Sean Curran, an experimental choreographer recently responsible for the wonderful dances in the play ''James Joyce's 'The Dead,' '' creates highly precise group pieces for his modern-dance troupe. Words like shape and clarity come to mind.</p>
        <p>But when he performs his own solos, Mr. Curran is an irrepressible genie, erupting into swift-footed shifts of emotional imagery. ''Approaching a City,'' a new solo to be repeated on Thursday through Sunday as part of a Sean Curran Company season presented by Danspace Project at St. Mark's Church, shows him in a theatrically sly mode.</p>
        <p>The themes of alienation and loss that recur in the group pieces take the form of meditations on urban hopes and loneliness. Wearing a suit, Mr. Curran rushed in with store mannequins in children's clothes and placed them in expressive attitudes. One figure was a choirboy, in contrast to a ''boy'' in a blazer. A ''girl'' looked saucy, hands at her hips.</p>
        <p>All the figures came vividly to life on Friday night after Mr. Curran recited passages from E. B. White's ''This Is New York'' and poems (by Dick Rogers and Earl Hagen, Galway Kinell and Andy Young). All were related to life in the big city. Often the texts were distilled in the dances Mr. Curran performed so electrifyingly.</p>
        <p>At heart, he is a quick-change artist who turns one character into another before our eyes. A jazz overture by Marty Beller impelled him into a show business strut, a young man eager for fulfillment in the city. Rubbery-legged, he suddenly turned morose. But just as suddenly hope returned in a skip and prance.</p>
        <p>''Approaching a City'' has a welcome sharpness and anger, a useful contrast to the program's older pieces. ''Symbolic Logic'' is an admirable formal exercise for dancers in white leotards. It is visibly influenced by India's classical dances and music but resembles an exercise nonetheless. ''The Nothing That Is Not There, and the Nothing That Is'' had more warmth and depth. Marisa Demos, Tony Guglietti, Peter Kalivas and Heather Waldon-Arnold matched Janacek's successively lyrical and turbulent music on an emotional plane. The movement was formal with tension in the partnering. But relationships were paramount, flowing out of heightened gesture.</p>
        <p>Philip Sandstrom's sensitive lighting played a large part in the sober aura of ''Six Laments,'' as solos and duets spoke of lost friends and memories. The beautifully schooled company includes Amy Brous, Eun Jung Choi, Donna Scro Gentile, Jennifer Risch, J. M. Rebudal and Yuji Yoda.</p>
