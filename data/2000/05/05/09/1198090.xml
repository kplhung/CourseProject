        <p>Handgun Control Inc., the gun control advocacy group, has begun running this 30-second advertisement in seven cities, including Austin, Tex.; Columbus, Ohio; Lansing, Mich.; Sacramento and Washington. The group says it is spending several thousand dollars to buy air time, but Republican officials assert that the amount is closer to $100,000.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- MacWilliams, Cosgrove, Smith, Robinson of Washington.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- A still photo of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, closing in tightly on his left eye. Cut to a shot in which a man is shown tucking a large silver pistol under his belt buckle. Scenes of a rustic church and children riding on a carousel dramatically break apart, like a smashed mirror, to reveal a grainy video clip of Kayne Robinson, first vice president of the National Rifle Association, talking emphatically to an audience of N.R.A. members. Concludes with a shot of the White House.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Male announcer: ''George Bush says if you want to know what he'll do as president, take a look at his record.'' Female announcer: ''As governor of Texas, Bush signed the law that allows carrying concealed handguns for the first time in 125 years.'' Male announcer: ''And he signed the law that allows carrying those concealed handguns in churches, nursing homes, even amusement parks.'' Female announcer: ''No wonder the N.R.A. says'': (voice of Mr. Robinson) ''If we win, we'll have a president'' (here Mr. Robinson's words are spliced to bring two sentence fragments together) ''where we work out of their office.'' Female announcer: ''Tell Governor Bush: The White House is our house.'' Male announcer: ''And it shouldn't belong to the N.R.A.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- It is true that Mr. Bush has often sided with the National Rifle Association in legislative battles in his more than five years as governor. Over the objections of gun control advocates, he signed legislation allowing people to carry concealed handguns, allowing handguns to be taken into churches and prohibiting local governments from suing gun manufacturers. The N.R.A.'s executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, also recently helped raise at least $250,000 at a major Republican Party fund-raiser honoring Mr. Bush. But Mr. Bush has at times tried to distance himself from the organization, by supporting mandatory trigger locks for new handguns and criticizing Mr. LaPierre for asserting that President Clinton had tolerated a certain level of gun violence for political reasons.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- By trying to depict Mr. Bush as a pawn of the N.R.A., the advertisement seeks to make him seem like an extremist on gun control issues, because the N.R.A. is widely perceived as intransigently opposed to any restrictions on gun ownership. Also, it suggests that the governor is not his own man, that he is beholden to powerful right-wing interest groups. The advertisement is not being shown widely enough to affect many voters directly, but Handgun Control is clearly hoping that journalists in Washington and Texas will use it to write critical stories about Mr. Bush. The group is also running the spot in several cities with hotly contested Congressional races in which gun control may become an important issue, including Lansing and Columbus.</p>
