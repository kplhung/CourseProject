        <p>The once-mighty Texas Democratic Party, whose fabled leaders Lyndon B. Johnson and Sam Rayburn dominated not just the state but also the nation, has fallen on very hard times.</p>
        <p>Of today's 29 officials elected statewide in Texas, none are Democrats. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican, faces only token Democratic opposition in her re-election campaign this year, which is more opposition than the party is providing in most statewide races.

        <p>The once-mighty Texas Democratic Party, whose fabled leaders Lyndon B. Johnson and Sam Rayburn dominated not just the state but also the nation, has fallen on very hard times.</p>
        <p>Of today's 29 officials elected statewide in Texas, none are Democrats. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Republican, faces only token Democratic opposition in her re-election campaign this year, which is more opposition than the party is providing in most statewide races. And much to the chagrin of the Democratic state chairwoman, Molly Beth Malcolm, several Democratic legislators are out campaigning with none other than the second-term governor, George W. Bush, soon to be the Republican presidential nominee.</p>
        <p>''I'm disappointed they would do that,'' said Ms. Malcolm, who returned from vacation in Italy to find that her members were consorting with the enemy. ''They are not representing the Democratic Party.''</p>
        <p>Other than the most partisan Republicans, few people in Texas would argue that Democrats are powerless or obsolete, particularly since the party still controls the Congressional delegation and the Texas House of Representatives. But as Mr. Bush campaigns for the White House, Democrats are consumed by a parochial, less glamorous electoral agenda, including legislative races and preparing for the 2002 run for governor. And few elected Democrats are willing to make trouble for the popular Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>The state's most famous Democrat, former Gov. Ann W. Richards, who spends much of her time as a Washington lobbyist, is among those who have refrained from attacking the man who defeated her in 1994. The state's most powerful Democrat,  Pete Laney, speaker of the Texas House, has so far stayed out of the presidential race. Other conservative Democrats in the Legislature either like Mr. Bush personally or are wary of antagonizing him as their districts become increasingly Republican.</p>
        <p>''There's no percentage in giving Bush a hard time,'' said Harvey Kronberg, publisher of The Quorum Report, a widely read online newsletter covering Texas politics.</p>
        <p>That detente is a timely gift for Mr. Bush as he positions himself as a coalition builder who would foster bipartisanship in Washington. By contrast, Arkansas Republicans tried to crush Bill Clinton in 1992, maligning his record and his character and leaving little doubt of their goal. ''Defeating the enemy at all costs,'' recalled Richard Bearden, then the executive director of the Arkansas Republican Party, ''and Bill Clinton was the enemy.''</p>
        <p>Unlike Arkansas, where Republicans felt little incentive to play nice with Mr. Clinton, Texas has a tradition of bipartisanship and chauvinism that for some Democrats outweighs any national party loyalties.</p>
        <p>''For most Texans, it's a no-brainer,'' one Texas Democrat, George Christian, press secretary to President Johnson, said of the 2000 race. ''It's an acceptable, bipartisan Texan running for president.''</p>
        <p>Merle Black, a political scientist at Emory University, said testimonials from home-state allies whom many voters across the country might find unexpected could provide credibility for presidential candidates introducing themselves to a national audience. Coming out of Georgia in 1976, Jimmy Carter enlisted the civil rights leader Andrew Young to help demonstrate that he was a Southern Democrat of a sort different from the race-baiting George C. Wallace.  In the same vein, Mr. Black said, Mr. Bush is enlisting Texas Democrats to help reassure voters that he is different from the combative Congressional Republicans of the 1990's.</p>
        <p>''Bush is trying to show that he's not Newt Gingrich, he's not Tom DeLay, he's not Dick Armey,'' Mr. Black said.</p>
        <p>Though the decline of the Texas Democrats has roots in the 1960's, the unequivocal slap in the face from the voters came in 1998, when the party lost every one of more than a dozen statewide races, from governor to lieutenant governor to land commissioner, and Mr. Bush won  with nearly 70 percent of the vote.</p>
        <p>So when Democratic officials announced last year that they would not field candidates for six of the eight statewide races this November, Republicans happily began writing obituaries. In April, Democratic officials were further embarrassed when a perennially losing candidate best known for his name, Gene Kelly, sought and won the party's nomination to challenge Ms. Hutchison, an overwhelming favorite.</p>
        <p>Democrats point out that they still dominate local politics in much of the state. The mayors of Dallas, Austin, Houston and San Antonio are Democrats, and the party still controls a large majority of county governments, particularly in South Texas. But Robert Black, spokesman for the Texas Republican Party, notes that while Republicans control local government in only 57 of the state's 254 counties, those 57 counties account for 56 percent of the population.</p>
        <p>An autopsy of recent Democratic misfortunes would point to money and demographics as the chief problems. Texas' huge size requires statewide candidates to raise millions upon millions of dollars in order to compete in every media market. With corporate interests favoring Republicans, said Mr. Kronberg, the online analyst, Democrats often depend on contributions from trial lawyers. And Republicans, led by Mr. Bush, have demonized the trial bar as greedy pushers of unnecessary lawsuits.</p>
        <p>''Democrats going statewide,'' Mr. Kronberg said, ''have to prove they're not pawns to trial lawyers.''</p>
        <p>As for demographics, Dan McClung, a Democratic political consultant in Houston, said large numbers of Republican-leaning white voters had moved from out of state into the suburbs of Dallas, Austin and Houston. These new voters, Mr. McClung said, were crucial in the narrow 1998 defeat of two well-known Democrats, John Sharp, who ran for lieutenant governor, and Paul Hobby, who ran for state comptroller.</p>
        <p>''We've virtually been shoved aside,'' said Mr. McClung, who worked for Mr. Hobby.</p>
        <p>With the party struggling, many Democrats agree that a high-profile effort to attack and embarrass Mr. Bush would make little sense.</p>
        <p>''Right now, our fight is not statewide,'' Mr. McClung said. ''George W. Bush is popular. He's extremely well financed. And most Texans would prefer to have a president from Texas than fight about party politics.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Malcolm, who switched from Republican to Democrat in 1992, said her party was in ''a rebuilding period.'' She said the decision not to contest most statewide races this year was a strategic one. Democrats hope instead to keep control of the House and win back the State Senate, where Republicans hold an edge of only 16 to 15. Whichever party controls the Legislature will also control Congressional and legislative redistricting, and Democrats dearly want to hold their 17-to-13 majority in the United States House.</p>
        <p>To a large extent, the immediate future of Texas politics depends on Mr. Bush's future. If he wins in November, his job will fall to Lt. Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican whose replacement would be chosen by the State Senate. As the presiding officer of the Senate, the lieutenant governor is considered the official with greatest influence over legislation, and a handful of candidates in both parties are already jockeying for position.</p>
        <p>But neither party dominates the Senate, and no one expects a party-line vote for lieutenant governor. Instead, victory will require attracting votes from both sides, and the hopefuls are making certain to avoid any partisan warfare. One of them, State Senator Ken Armbrister, was among  four Democrats who campaigned with Mr. Bush in Ohio last month.</p>
        <p>Regardless of the outcome in November, Democrats say, they are pointing to 2002 and beyond. The powerful statewide offices of governor, lieutenant governor, attorney general and comptroller are on the ballot in 2002. Mr. Bush will either be in Washington or leaving office in Austin, and Democratic officials already envision a statewide ticket that would include Mr. Sharp, Mr. Hobby and perhaps the mayors of Dallas, Ron Kirk, and Austin, Kirk Watson.</p>
        <p>Most tantalizing of all, in the eyes of many Democrats, is the possible return of former Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros of San Antonio.  Though he has been marred by scandal involving his payments to a former mistress, party insiders believe that Mr. Cisneros's star power and fund-raising potential remain strong in Texas.</p>
        <p>Mr. McClung and other Democrats also believe that the state's changing demographics may turn in their favor in this decade. Hispanics are expected to soon become the state's most populous ethnic group, and as yet they usually support Democrats. Mr. Bush has aggressively courted Hispanics, but Democrats believe that their appeal is stronger. In addition, college-age voters are showing renewed interest in the party. All this is the gospel that Democrats are repeating to themselves.</p>
        <p>At least one of the old lions is roaring again. Ben Barnes, a former speaker of the Texas House and lieutenant governor from the Democratic glory days, gave a recent speech at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas in which he maintained that the state  ''is drifting toward mediocrity just when it should be striving for greatness.'' Mr. Barnes recited a litany of woes, from crumbling infrastructure to underpaid teachers to substandard health care for the poor. Noting that the state could soon have a $3 billion surplus, he warned against more tax cuts, calling for vast investment in schools and other institutions, medical research and transportation.</p>
        <p>Maybe it was a call to arms, or maybe it was just a speech.</p>
