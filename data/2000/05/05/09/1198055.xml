        <p>The formal talks at the meeting were all about planned and proposed spacecraft missions throughout the solar system: stunning descriptions of balloons deployed in the atmosphere of Venus to sample its acrid air or robot vehicles plumbing the moons of Jupiter or blasting holes in asteroids.</p>
        <p>But informal discussions in the hallways, during meals and at cocktail hour often drifted to recent concerns about mounting challenging interplanetary missions on tight budgets and risking failure by trying to do too much with too little.</p>
        <p>As 300 space scientists and engineers gathered for the fourth International Conference on Low-Cost Planetary Missions, conversations turned to last year's failures of two American Mars probes and how lessons learned might apply to other projects under way or being planned. The twin losses of the Mars Climate Orbiter and Mars Polar Lander craft, hallmarks of the less-expensive exploratory approach, have spurred worldwide self-examination on how best to uncover the solar system's secrets on a budget.</p>
        <p>Stamatios M. Krimigis, head of the Space Department at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory here and host of the conference that is held every two years, said the growing emphasis on low-cost international missions had fundamentally changed planetary exploration. ''The question is whether we'll survive the revolution,'' he said at the meeting.</p>
        <p>Most of those attending the conference agreed that flying more budget planetary missions and fewer billion-dollar larger ones had become the norm. There remains a need for some larger, more comprehensive robot craft, like the Galileo probe that has spent years exploring Jupiter and its moons. But teasing out details about numerous planets, moons, asteroids, comets and other bodies requires flying many more missions more often than in the past.</p>
        <p>''We've done surveys of the solar system with Voyager, Galileo and other major missions to find out what is out there,'' said Dr. Edward C. Stone, director of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif. ''Now the challenge is to get out to these places and sample them in detail. And that means we have to go much more often and need a lower-cost way of doing it.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Stone said in an interview that the failure of the recent Mars spacecraft, for which his laboratory has taken some criticism for its management of the missions, showed that there were limits to the ''faster, better, cheaper'' approach to programs NASA had taken in recent years. ''We found that there was a limit to 'faster, better, cheaper' and that we took too big a step based on past successes,'' he said.</p>
        <p>All current programs are being re-examined to assure that they can meet their goals and are properly managed, he said. ''Everyone is looking at what they are doing to be sure they are managing the risks associated with spaceflight properly.''</p>
        <p>Independent panels of experts who reviewed the back-to-back losses of the $165 million Mars lander and the $125 orbiter last fall blamed the failures on inadequate management, insufficient testing and poor financing. The pressure to conform to the ''faster, better, cheaper'' credo compromised the projects and forced people to try to do too much with too few resources, the critics said, and upper management had no idea of how much trouble the programs were in.</p>
        <p>One of the studies, conducted by Tony Spear, the retired project manager of NASA's popular 1997 Mars Pathfinder mission, said senior managers expected too much of projects that followed his successful one. He suggested that NASA slow the planning and approval of new low-cost programs until it trained more experienced project managers, put into effect better risk assessment for continuing projects and replaced seasoned engineers and managers lost to retirement or staff cuts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spear, who headed a session at the conference on the ''faster, better, cheaper'' controversy, said it was too early to say if the reforms urged by the review panels would make a difference in future mission success. NASA's entire Mars exploration program is under review, with the space agency so far deciding to send a planned 2001 orbital mission but canceling a landing craft for that year.</p>
        <p>The first projects in NASA's streamlined program to explore the solar system, including the $270 million Pathfinder and the $224 million NEAR Shoemaker asteroid rendezvous mission operated by the Johns Hopkins laboratory, were successful because they were adequately financed and staffed. This, he said, could have inadvertently contributed to later problems.</p>
        <p>''Pathfinder allowed us to be too complacent in future project planning,'' Mr. Spear said. ''After the first wave of success, the bar was raised for cutting costs even more,  and it went too far. For Mars, they tried to get two missions for the price of one and it couldn't be done.''</p>
        <p>At his session, Mr. Spear said he interviewed hundreds of people for his study and had spoken with thousands since, with most of them agreeing that the ''faster, better, cheaper'' policy of small missions espoused by NASA's administrator,  Daniel S. Goldin, was the best approach under current budget restraints. ''Most people agree that it's here to stay, even if they can't define what 'faster, better, cheaper' is,'' he said. ''It is simply an attempt to improve performance.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Ed Friedman, chief technologist for civil space for the Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corporation in Boulder, Colo., said the approach simply meant trying to do more with the same resources. ''It's like a losing football team at the end of a game going into a two-minute drill,'' he said. ''They try to do more of what they have been doing to win.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Friedman said the concept could be improved in several ways, including doing realistic testing of spacecraft under the same conditions they would encounter on a mission, having all team members understand the entire mission and not just their parts of it, paying more attention to the unique computer software required for each mission, and keeping some people in a program from the earliest design stages until the end to maintain a continuity that could not be conveyed in written reports or computer databases.</p>
        <p>Liam P. Sarsfield, a senior policy analyst with the Rand Corporation's Science and Technology Policy Institute, criticized ''faster, better, cheaper'' as ''sloganeering versus engineering.'' While building smaller spacecraft is inevitable because the technology exists to do it, they are more economical and scientists favor this approach, he said NASA was mainly using the concept simply as a performance tool for cutting costs.</p>
        <p>''It's wrong to try to combine high risk with aggressive cost goals,'' Mr. Sarsfield said. To achieve cost objectives, he said, NASA cut too deeply into testing and technical reviews that would have contributed to better risk assessments for these projects. He noted that critiques of the Mars mission failures found that the projects were understaffed, requiring some team members to work 80-hour weeks to try to keep up with their workloads.</p>
        <p>''This creates satellite sweatshops that are unfair to workers who are inadequately compensated for their time, and hides the true costs of the programs,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spear agreed with some of the criticism, saying that people who took short cuts or ''dumb risks'' under the guise of ''faster, better, cheaper'' were not properly following the concept. ''There has to be some flexibility and the ability to adjust goals if things don't go as planned,'' he said. ''If you are working under a fixed cost and schedule, for instance, you have to be able to change the scope of the mission, perhaps leaving an experiment or something off to compensate.''</p>
        <p>Participants at the meeting said that even without formal policies to cut costs, there was pressure worldwide to find ways drive down the price of space exploration. The European Space Agency (ESA), a consortium of 15 countries, is planning to dispatch a mission called Mars Express that would orbit the planet's poles in 2003 and send down a small lander to examine soil composition.</p>
        <p>While ESA has never adopted the ''faster, better, cheaper'' mantra, there has been considerable pressure to cut mission costs in recent years, said Gordon P. Whitcomb of the European consortium. In a new approach, the Mars mission will use technology developed for previous projects and turn over much of the project management to contractors working under the supervision of a reduced ESA project team.</p>
