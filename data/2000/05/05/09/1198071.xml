        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Invoking the Moral Authority of Moms'' (Week in Review, May 7): You report that a conservative commentator, Kate O'Beirne, described the Million Mom March as deeply political.</p>
        <p>The march is political only in that the process by which the rules will change is at the federal legislative level, and therefore that is what needs influencing. The marchers are not pulling for any one party, nor are they shilling for tertiary issues.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Invoking the Moral Authority of Moms'' (Week in Review, May 7): You report that a conservative commentator, Kate O'Beirne, described the Million Mom March as deeply political.</p>
        <p>The march is political only in that the process by which the rules will change is at the federal legislative level, and therefore that is what needs influencing. The marchers are not pulling for any one party, nor are they shilling for tertiary issues.</p>
        <p>The sole issue is guns and the fact that the rules governing their manufacture, distribution, purchase and use are more lax than those governing cars, food or toys.</p>
        <p>Turning the march into a political ball to be tossed between either party is demeaning to the people who have worked tirelessly over the last nine months to make their voices heard.</p>
        <p>Any politician is welcome and implored to step up and begin representing the clear will of the constituents of this country, rather than ceding that responsibility to the questionable motives and methods of the gun lobby.</p>
