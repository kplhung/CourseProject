        <p>It may be the source of deep concern in the art world, but the federal antitrust investigation of the world's two largest auction houses elicited a well-heeled shrug from many prospective bidders last night at Christie's auction of Impressionist and post-Impressionist art.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department investigation, which came to wide attention when two top officials at Sotheby's resigned in February, centers on whether the leadership of Sotheby's and its archrival, Christie's, colluded to set commissions they charge buyers and sellers. While those allegations had certainly registered in the minds of those present last night, most drew a firm distinction between the behind-the-scenes scandal and the art on display.</p>

        <p>It may be the source of deep concern in the art world, but the federal antitrust investigation of the world's two largest auction houses elicited a well-heeled shrug from many prospective bidders last night at Christie's auction of Impressionist and post-Impressionist art.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department investigation, which came to wide attention when two top officials at Sotheby's resigned in February, centers on whether the leadership of Sotheby's and its archrival, Christie's, colluded to set commissions they charge buyers and sellers. While those allegations had certainly registered in the minds of those present last night, most drew a firm distinction between the behind-the-scenes scandal and the art on display.</p>
        <p>''It's the pictures that people are interested in,'' said Rodney Hawes, a 40-something retiree who arrived early to scout the field. ''The antitrust stuff has nothing to do with it.''</p>
        <p>Another buyer was even more adamant. A 47-year-old bidder from London, who spoke on condition on anonymity, said, ''Anybody who doesn't bid or bids less on a painting they love and want for their collection because of some investigation is insane.''</p>
        <p>That sentiment was repeated time and again as a stream of limousines and private cars pulled up to Christie's headquarters in Rockefeller Center. Inside the marble-tiled auction house, where art worth millions of dollars was on display and about to change hands, it seemed to be business as usual as cliques of visitors in tuxedos and pearls traded pleasantries in French, Japanese and accented English.</p>
        <p>Much of the chatting seemed to focus on the day's weather, which lingered in the upper 80's right up until the auction started at 7 p.m.</p>
        <p>''Nobody gives a damn about the investigation,'' said Maria Friedberg, an elderly collector, who fanned herself with a bidding paddle. ''The dealers know what is a real price and what is fake. These people are professionals.</p>
        <p>''Besides,'' she added, ''Sotheby's was worse than here.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, some bidders had the impression that Christie's was in less distress than Sotheby's, which is still weathering the resignations of Diana D. Brooks, the company's president and chief executive, and A. Alfred Taubman, its chairman, on Feb. 21.</p>
        <p>Still, several others said that such scandals might have scared off some smaller bidders. ''I believe it discouraged a couple of people,'' said a 25-year-old collector in a Gucci suit who refused to give his name -- or wear a tie. ''But not the institutional bidders.''</p>
        <p>Another of the younger generation of buyers said the regularity of outrages in the art world had inured him to the most recent troubles.</p>
        <p>''It's not the first time such stories have happened in art galleries,'' said Blaise Parinaud, 25, a buyer for Hammer Galleries on West 57th Street in Manhattan. ''We keep talking about this a lot because it's a small world and everybody knows each other. But for my part, I'm not so concerned about a petit scandale like this.''</p>
        <p>What concerned him more, Mr. Parinaud said, was the recent fluctuations in the Dow Jones and Nasdaq stock indexes, where much of the buyers' money was coming from.</p>
        <p>''We're selling dreams,'' he said. ''And when people have money problems, especially in the stock market, we're the first ones to notice it.''</p>
