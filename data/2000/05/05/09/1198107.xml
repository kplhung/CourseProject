        <p>Chinese are channeling anger resulting from NATO bombing of Embassy in Belgrade year ago into strengthening of economy and there is little sentiment for renewed protests; Government, which railed against US, is focused on passage of trade bill by Congress which would give country membership in World Trade Organization; many Chinese regard measure as litmus test of American attitudes (S)</p>

        <p>One year ago today, university students were hurling bricks at the American Embassy in a rage over the NATO bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade that killed 3 people and injured 20. Today, they spent a balmy Monday attending classes or playing soccer.</p>
        <p>The Chinese government, which last year railed against American perfidy and imperialist ambitions, commemorated the bombing in a low-key manner, as well. A government spokesman restated China's position that the American explanation that the attack resulted from targeting errors remains inadequate. An editorial in the People's Daily called on Chinese to channel their continued anger into strengthening the economy.</p>
        <p>Many Chinese say they still believe that the bombing had to have been intentional, meant to warn or punish China, and resentment persists. But now, the government and people want most to see the China trade bill pass Congress this month.</p>
        <p>Conversations with students at People's University here today found no sentiment for renewed rock throwing in any case.</p>
        <p>Zhou Jiubo, 21, who is studying management, was at the American Embassy in May heaving bricks. ''We were all hot-headed and angry,'' he recalled. ''But now we've taken to heart the government's advice to study hard and make China strong. We need to make our country stronger so it won't be subject to bullying any more.''</p>
        <p>Zhao Bingling, 22, a law student, said, ''We haven't forgotten about the bombing.''</p>
        <p>What worries her more today, she said, is the Congressional trade vote, which many here see as a litmus test of American attitudes. If the bill is defeated, she said, ''I think there will be a very strong reaction.''</p>
