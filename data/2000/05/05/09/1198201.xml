        <p>A cell phone rang. Msgr. Charles M. Kavanagh reached into his cassock, extracted the phone, and answered it.</p>
        <p>It was a ''semi-emergency,'' he said, and politely excused himself.</p>
        <p>Two hundred political figures,  some of them past and present rivals; 200 bishops; 500 ''major people,'' from university heads to corporate benefactors; 130 of the cardinal's relatives; several hundred more of his friends; the secretary general of the United Nations; 100 leaders from other faiths. When Cardinal John O'Connor died, all of them became the responsibility of Monsignor Kavanagh, the vicar for development for the Archdiocese of New York, and, for yesterday's funeral, the man in charge of Very Important People.</p>
        <p>In the previous few days, Monsignor Kavanagh turned down City Council members pleading for seats, told many powerful people that there were no seats for their spouses or aides, and informed all the invited political figures that the cardinal's will had clearly instructed that there be no political participation in the service; it was to be a purely religious tribute from the cardinal's personal and church families.</p>
        <p>''The White House, and others, were wonderful in saying they understood,'' he said, adding, ''The farther down on the food chain, the more difficult it became.''</p>
        <p>Monsignor Kavanagh, 62, the pastor of St. Raymond's parish in the Bronx, had arranged transportation, hotels and seating, and told those who called on Sunday night seeking an invitation that no matter how important, they were simply too late. He had made sure cardinals and bishops got to a lunch held by Mutual of America and a dinner offered by Chase Manhattan Bank. He had barely slept.</p>
        <p>After 36 years in the priesthood for a ''New York City boy'' -- born at Riverside Drive and 85th Street -- Monsignor Kavanagh ended up in a position of importance in the archdiocese. He spends days in Manhattan at the archdiocesan headquarters, and his nights at St. Raymond's.</p>
        <p>''That's my love,'' he said of the parish, just as the cell phone rang.</p>
