        <p>Brian Gionta scored two goals and the United States extended its surprising run at the world hockey championships in Russia yesterday by handing Sweden its first loss of the tournament, 5-3.</p>
        <p>The Americans, who had already secured a berth in the quarterfinals, will end the second round atop the Group E standing, ahead of Switzerland, Latvia and Sweden.</p>
        <p>''Our goal was to qualify for the quarterfinals, and now we've done that,'' Coach Lou Vairo said. ''Now we have to win our game Thursday or we go home. Now we might be able to advance to the medal round.''</p>
        <p>In other games yesterday in St. Petersburg, the Czech Republic beat Slovakia, 6-2, Finland clinched a spot in the quarterfinals with a 7-4 victory over Norway, and Switzerland defeated Latvia, 4-1, to secure its place in the quarterfinals.</p>
        <p>BOURQUE SKIPS PRACTICE: Colorado Avalanche defenseman Ray Bourque sat out practice yesterday with a sore knee but could be ready for the Western Conference finals.</p>
        <p>''I'll work hard and keep doing the things that we have been doing, taking treatments and skating,'' the 21-year veteran said.</p>
        <p>The Avalanche plays the Dallas Stars in the conference finals later this week. A date has not been set for Game 1.</p>
        <p>Bourque strained ligaments in his left knee in the second period of Game 3 against the Detroit Red Wings on May 1. He missed Games 4 and 5, which Colorado won to advance to the conference finals.</p>
        <p>Bourque received treatment yesterday while his teammates practiced, then skated by himself for 40 minutes at Colorado's training facility. It was the second time in four days that Bourque skated.</p>
        <p>''I felt pretty good,'' Bourque said. ''I was really happy with how it went Friday, took the weekend off in terms of ice, had treatment, worked out and worked out again today and will skate every day this week.''</p>
