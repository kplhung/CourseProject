        <p>There was an air of curiosity at Christie's last night as the first big evening sale of the spring got under way. Not only was it the first sale since the federal antitrust investigation of Christie's and Sotheby's heated up, but it was also the first auction since both companies raised the fees they charge buyers.</p>
        <p>Many works sold for far less than their estimates, but sell they did. All but five of the 47 works on offer found buyers. The sale totaled $104.5 million, just above it low estimate of $101 million.</p>
        <p>The Rockefeller Center salesroom was packed with the usual faces: dealers and collectors who gather twice a year to watch which way the art market will go. At times the audience was surprised at how strong some prices were for top paintings and sculptures, but it was equally surprised when works sold for sometimes millions of dollars below expectations.</p>
        <p>The reason, experts said, had little to do with either the investigation or the new buyer's premium. When Christie's put the sale together month ago, there were no major estates, and as a result they had to convince sellers that now was the right time to get top dollar.</p>
        <p>Christie's also had what dealers call ''the Phillips factor.'' With Bernard Arnault, the new owner of Phillips, offering sellers large sums to compete with Sotheby's and Christie's, estimates became more aggressive than they might have otherwise been.</p>
        <p>By yesterday, however, Christie's had a good idea of where prices were going and had cleverly persuaded sellers to drop their expectations.</p>
        <p>By far the evening's biggest success was for Caillebotte's ''Man on the Balcony, Boulevard Haussmann'' (1880), which depicts a man who experts think was the artist's lawyer, Albert Courtier, shaded by a red-and-white awning, looking out at the boulevard from the balcony of Caillebotte's Paris apartment.</p>
        <p>Seven bidders tried to buy the painting, which had been estimated at $6 million to $8 million. It eventually sold for $14.3 million to Simon de Pury, the former chairman of Sotheby's in Europe, who is now a private dealer and was bidding on behalf of a collector. Before the sale, it was known that the Metropolitan Museum of Art would be a bidder, since it has no Caillebotte in its permanent collection, but the museum was unsuccessful. The price was a record for Caillebotte, seven times his previous record of $2 million, set at Christie's in London in 1989 at the height of the market.</p>
        <p>The evening's most expensive painting was one of the greatest examples of Monet's ''Waterlily'' series, painted by the lily pond behind the artist's house in Giverny, outside Paris. This one, from 1906, has been in the same unidentified private collection for more than 85 years and is in pristine condition. Estimated at $20 million to $25 million, it sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $20.9 million. The price, though high, was lower than that for another waterlily painting of the same date that Christie's sold in November for $22.5 million. ''This one was possibly quieter in coloring than the one we sold in the fall,'' said Christopher Burge, Christie's honorary chairman, who was the evening' auctioneer.</p>
        <p>(Final prices include Christie's commission, 17.5 percent of the first $80,000 plus 10 percent of any amount above that. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)</p>
        <p>Another Monet that received considerable attention last night was ''Windmills in Holland,'' an 1871 landscape that demonstrated the artist's talent for capturing flickering reflections of light on water. It sold for $3 million, its low estimate, to an unidentified telephone bidder. The painting came from the estate of Guy Bjorkman, a businessman who divided his time between Manhattan and Geneva before his death last year.</p>
        <p>Also being sold from his estate was an 1890 Toulouse-Lautrec portrait of a woman known only as Berthe the Deaf, who worked in a brothel frequented by the artist, sitting in a wicker chair. This was one of the evening's biggest casualties: it was estimated at $6 million to $8 million, but nobody raised a paddle. Mr. Burge stopped trying at $3.4 million.</p>
        <p>An unusual Renoir, ''Berthe Morisot and Her Daughter, Julie Manet'' (1894), of the artist Berthe Morisot seated in profile with her daughter standing behind her, was being sold by Morisot's descendants. Estimated at $9 million to $12 million, it sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $8.8 million. Even more surprising was a second Monet, ''Waterlily Pond'' (1917-19), which sold to an unidentified bidder for $6.8 million, more than $2 million less than its low $9 million estimate.</p>
        <p>The sale included several Degas pastels, with mixed results. Among the best was ''Breakfast After the Bath (Young Woman Drying Herself),'' which was being sold by Charles and Sylvia Gilman, New York philanthropists, to benefit the Tel Aviv University and the Tel Aviv Museum of Art. Estimated at $4 million to $6 million, it sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $4.1 million.</p>
        <p>Prices for sculpture were consistently high. A group of Rodin bronzes being sold by Ruth Weinstein, a New York collector, brought prices far above anyone's expectations. ''The Kiss,'' cast in 1887-88, sold to a unidentified dealer for $2.7 million, nicely above its low estimate of $2 million. ''They were all early casts,'' said Franck Giraud, who heads Christie's departments of 19th- and 20th-century art. ''For special objects like these very famous images, the market will always be particularly strong.''</p>
