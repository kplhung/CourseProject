        <p>Although the Clinton administration has made ''humanitarian intervention'' a centerpiece of its foreign policy, it has done a poor job of delivering emergency aid to the people who need it, an internal State Department report says.</p>
        <p>The ''humanitarian factor has become central to senior policy makers' deliberations over U.S. foreign policy priorities,'' the report states. But the officials who are responsible for easing human suffering in foreign crises have little influence over high-level decision making, and in some cases are deliberately shut out, the study says.</p>
        <p>The report, written by a top adviser to Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, chronicles the billions of dollars in emergency assistance that have been sent to Afghanistan, Kosovo and Sudan to help people whose lives have been disrupted by war and to Honduras in the aftermath of a big hurricane in 1998.</p>
        <p>Last year, when Serbian forces began expelling ethnic Albanians from Kosovo several days after the start of the NATO bombing campaign, senior administration officials publicly insisted that they were prepared for Serbian actions. Despite that, there was little food and shelter  on hand as hundreds of thousands of refugees flooded into Macedonia and Albania.</p>
        <p>The report describes the administration's main funnel for assistance to the expelled Kosovars, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, as suffering from ''weak leadership'' in the region and adds that the administration was unable to change this.</p>
        <p>In Sudan, where the United States has spent more than $1 billion in the last 10 years trying to ease suffering in longest-running civil war in Africa, the report says the assistance has become so routine that it now appears to act as a substitute for peacemaking efforts to resolve the conflict.</p>
        <p>The report, initiated by Morton H. Halperin, director of policy planning at the State Department, and based on interviews with senior administration officials, is an unclassified document. But it was not made public until now.</p>
        <p>It was obtained under the Freedom of Information Act by the National Security Archive, a group that specializes in collecting government documents through requests and suits. The report was completed in January and has been submitted to Dr. Albright's office.</p>
        <p>In outlining options for improving response, the report suggests that the relief programs run by the Agency for International Development could be folded into the State Department.</p>
        <p>This is one step short of what Senator Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, has been recommending since he took charge of the panel in 1995.</p>
        <p>Mr. Helms, who favors abolishing the agency as an independent entity and putting it into the State Department, said he believed ''bringing A.I.D. into the State Department will mean more effective use of the aid,'' his spokesman, Marc Thiessen, said.</p>
        <p>On the campaign trail, the two presumptive presidential candidates have differing views of the ''humanitarian intervention'' policy. George W. Bush Jr. has said he would be much more selective in deciding where and when the United States would intervene. Vice President Al Gore supported the interventionist policy in a recent major speech. Mr. Gore was instrumental in preventing the agency from being melded into the State Department years ago.</p>
        <p>In its account of how unprepared the administration was to meet the needs of the Kosovo refugees, the report points to shortcomings by American intelligence officials.</p>
        <p>Instead of anticipating an outpouring of refugees, the administration was expecting the opposite, that nearly a million people would be displaced in Kosovo in the bombing.</p>
        <p>''The prevailing worst-case scenario was that one million Kosovars would be displaced internally, prohibited from exiting, and remain largely inaccessible, in the context of an ongoing air war and a NATO determination not to launch a ground invasion,'' the report said.</p>
        <p>As for Sudan, the report added, many in the administration believed that top officials had exerted too little effort to resolve the conflict. That has been partly caused by deep divisions in the administration on Sudan, with some favoring total isolation and even more help to rebels in the south. In addition, officials responsible for the large assistance expenditures have been excluded from crucial decisions.</p>
        <p>Officials from A.I.D. and the State Department who managed the assistance program were not consulted when the administration decided to shut the American embassy in Khartoum in the mid-1990's because of security concerns. The closing undermined Washington's ability to talk to Khartoum about helping civilian war victims, the report said.</p>
