        <p>Thousands of protesters, including rival militias, marched today on the compound of Foday Sankoh, the rebel leader, some throwing rocks, and his partisans responded by firing into the crowd.</p>
        <p>Some of the protesters were shot execution-style as they lay on the ground, according to witnesses. Dozens of United Nations peacekeepers assigned to the house watched helplessly, shouting, ''Cease fire!''</p>
        <p>At least four people died.</p>
        <p>Outside Freetown, rebels fired at a United Nations helicopter that had flown with Mr. Sankoh's permission to the town of Makeni to get two wounded United Nations soldiers. After taking off, the pilot was forced to land and abandon the helicopter, said Lt. Col. Jaswinder Sandhu, a United Nations spokesman. The United Nations has already been humiliated by the taking as hostages of more than 500 of its personnel, soldiers and civilians around the country in the last week.</p>
        <p>The violence inside the capital underlined how badly the steps toward peace have been wiped out since the arrival of the United Nations force late last year.</p>
        <p>The day began as thousands gathered at a park to a march against Mr. Sankoh, whom many hold responsible for blocking the peace process and some consider a war criminal.</p>
        <p>Thousands of people marched across the Freetown peninsula, joined by some former soldiers and Kamajors, who are traditional hunters, toward Mr. Sankoh's house in western Freetown. Mr. Sankoh lives in a two-story home inside a compound guarded by United Nations peacekeepers and his own men.</p>
        <p>Around noon, the peacekeepers appeared overwhelmed by the crowd, which pushed toward the compound and began hurling rocks and bricks at the house. The peacekeepers, pinned against a fence, are believed to have fired in the air. It was not clear what happened next. But witnesses said that Mr. Sankoh's own men began shooting at the crowd and that, in turn, former government soldiers who were among the protesters began firing at Mr. Sankoh's men.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sankoh, who at the time remained inside his house and was not injured, told The Associated Press after the clash: ''They're provoking us. Democracy is not about assaulting people's homes.''</p>
        <p>The whereabouts of Mr. Sankoh was not clear by tonight. ''As I speak to you, the exact whereabouts of Corp. Foday Sankoh has not yet been determined,'' President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah said on national radio, using the rank that Mr. Sankoh held in the Sierra Leonean army before he was cashiered years ago.</p>
        <p>It was not clear tonight exactly how many people had been killed or wounded outside Mr. Sankoh's home.</p>
        <p>By midafternoon, at Connaught Hospital and at an adjoining morgue, officials had recorded four deaths and 40 wounded, mostly from bullet wounds. In the operating room, Dr. Sabine Roquefort, of Doctors Without Borders, was the only surgeon working.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of Sierra Leoneans filed through the morgue, searching for friends and relatives who had yet to be found.</p>
        <p>''Sankoh was well protected, but the crowd was unprotected,'' said Mohammed Kallon, a member of Parliament who had helped organize the march.</p>
        <p>The violence appeared to increase some Sierra Leoneans' anger at the United Nations force, which has suffered a series of setbacks. Sierra Leoneans pelted some United Nations trucks with rocks today after the incident outside Mr. Sankoh's home.</p>
        <p>''The U.N. forces have not responded as well as we had expected,'' said Herbert Chuku, 30, who took part in the march. ''That's why we are expecting countries like America, France and Great Britain to put an effort.''</p>
