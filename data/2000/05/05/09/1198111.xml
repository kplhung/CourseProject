      <block class="full_text">
        <p>It was a big day for people tired of living in a small world.</p>
        <p>The large and tall, the pudgy and the plump -- in short, anyone who has ever had to endure the stigma of being overweight in a society where thin is in -- have won a battle for the bulge, at least here in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>In a move that says a lot about this city's legendary sensitivity, the Board of Supervisors today passed an ordinance that makes it illegal to discriminate against a person based on the nebulous category of ''size.''</p>
        <p>Known throughout the city as the ''fat ordinance,'' the measure actually applies to skinny people, too. It adds height and weight to the same antidiscrimination codes that provide protections for people based on race, religion, color, ancestry, age, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability and place of birth.</p>
        <p>The ordinance, inspired by a fitness company advertisement on a billboard last year ( ''When the aliens come, they will eat the fat ones first'') adds San Francisco to a short list of places in the nation -- Santa Cruz, Calif., Washington, D.C. and the state of Michigan -- with similar statutes.</p>
        <p>The ordinance has generated a number of jokes: one local columnist said it inspired him to form the ''California Association of the Not So Bad, Average and Mediocre.''</p>
        <p>But advocates for fat acceptance say the ordinance is a necessary remedy for all those who have ever been insulted, denied a seat at a restaurant or rejected for a job because of their appearance.</p>
        <p>''We're convinced that this is a serious problem that represents a loss of civil rights,'' said Larry Brinkin of the San Francisco Human Rights Commission.</p>
        <p>Marilyn Wann, a local leader of the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance, and the author of ''Fat! So?'' (Ten Speed Press, 1998), called the legislation historic and necessary, especially when about half of all Americans are overweight and 1 in 4 is medically obese, according to  government statistics.</p>
        <p>''We don't need a diet,'' said Ms. Wann, who said her 270 pounds on a 5-foot-4 frame was her natural size. ''We need an end to discrimination.''</p>
        <p>The growth of fat-acceptance groups is evident on the Internet; dozens of groups have Web sites, notably the Fat Activist Task Force, formed in 1989 to pressure Hallmark Cards to remove products poking fun at fat people from their merchandise list (www.naafa.org/fatf).</p>
        <p>''Fat people are people,'' said John Cahill, a San Francisco writer who carries his 250 pounds on a 6-foot frame. ''From the remarks I get on the Muni trains, you'd think I was a deaf cow.''</p>
        <p>About 20 people of various sizes, most large, attended the board meeting today to support the ordinance, which passed unanimously.</p>
        <p>''I've counseled too many women and men in body-image support groups who have had horrible experiences,'' said Melinda McBride, a graduate student. ''People have gone in for medical treatment for very specific things, and they've been told to lose weight. It's important that this law passed because it can have far-reaching implications outside of San Francisco.''</p>
        <p>Tom Ammiano, the president of the board and a former stand-up comedian who wrote the ordinance, said he was prompted to act in part because overweight people often become ''targets and even scapegoats of many negative moral traits, such as laziness, low intelligence, gluttony, bad health, etc.''</p>
        <p>In Santa Cruz, a 1992 ordinance banning discrimination based on height, weight, physical characteristics and sexual orientation was invoked only once, by two women who believed they were denied housing because they were a lesbian couple. The matter was resolved through arbitration. That ordinance clears the way for victims of discrimination to file a lawsuit seeking monetary redress, but none have yet been filed.</p>
        <p>In Michigan and Washington, D.C., where measures banning discrimination based on height and weight or appearance have been in force since the 1970's, numerous suits have been filed. Debbie Moss of the Human Rights Commission in Washington, said the ordinance was used by ''people being overweight, people having their hair a certain way -- there are all kinds of reasons.''</p>
        <p>But Rob Morse, the San Francisco Examiner columnist who advocated acceptance of mediocrity, said the new ordinance would probably not change life here all that much. ''In the past, the supes have voted to protect tropical hardwoods, the Burmese people and San Francisco's two daily newspapers,'' he said, ''and look at all the good that's done.''</p>
