        <p>An outburst of anger sometimes prompts the plaintive response, ''Don't have a heart attack!'' There may be something to that advice, it turns out.</p>
        <p>A study that looked at almost 13,000 people over six years found that those who were most prone to anger were about 2.5 times as likely to have heart attacks or sudden cardiac deaths as their calmer counterparts.</p>
        <p>''People who experience frequent and intense anger may benefit by learning to identify triggers of their anger,'' said the lead author of the study, Dr. Janice E. Williams, who was an epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill when the research was done.</p>
        <p>Researchers followed the medical histories of people who appeared free of heart disease in four communities: Washington County, Md., suburban Minneapolis, Forsyth County, N.C., and Jackson, Miss.</p>
        <p>The subjects, chosen randomly, were given a 10-item questionnaire known as the Speilberger Trait Anger Scale, which assigns a score of 1 to 40, depending on the level of anger a person reports. The average was 16, and about 8 percent were rated as having high levels of anger (most were younger, less educated men who were more likely to drink and smoke).</p>
        <p>Over the course of the study, 256 people in the group had heart attacks. Those who were the most prone to anger were 2.69 times as likely to have them as those with the lowest scores. Those with moderate scores were 35 percent more likely to have heart attacks than those with the lowest.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the increased risk did not hold true for people with high blood pressure, who were already at higher risk. The researchers are not sure why this is.</p>
        <p>''It's perplexing,'' Dr. Williams said.</p>
