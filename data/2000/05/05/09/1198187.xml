        <p>Re ''Personal Recollections of a Prelate in Touch With the People'' (news article, May 8):</p>
        <p>I would like to share a special recollection of Cardinal John O'Connor that shows the measure of the man. Several years ago when I was the subject of nasty attacks in the press, the cardinal called me at home to cheer me up. He was very kind and gentle. I was deeply moved, particularly since we were not close and obviously differed on certain issues. In the end those differences didn't matter: he saw another person's plight and reached out to help.</p>

        <p>Too many of us get caught up in our differences. The cardinal's call showed how much he could look past them to our common humanity. It is a lesson all of us can take to heart.</p>
