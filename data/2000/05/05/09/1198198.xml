        <p>John Rocker balked home the winning run with two outs in the ninth inning, and the Florida Marlins scored three unearned runs to beat the Atlanta Braves, 3-2, last night in Miami.</p>
        <p>With a 2-2 count on Cliff Floyd and Danny Bautista at third, Rocker took his position on the rubber and the ball fell out of his glove. The second-base umpire, Mike DiMuro, called a balk, and Bautista trotted home.</p>
        <p>Rocker and Braves Manager Bobby Cox briefly spoke to DiMuro as the umpires left the field.</p>
        <p>''The only quote I'm giving is I'm a horrible player,'' said Rocker, who seemed incredulous rather than angry. ''I'm just a bad player. That's the bottom line.''</p>
        <p>It was the first game-ending balk in the National League since July 4, 1993, when the Braves beat the Marlins, 4-3, at Atlanta. Deion Sanders scored on the rookie Matt Turner's balk with one out in the bottom of the ninth.</p>
        <p>That had been the last game-winning balk in the majors until April 28, when Jeff Zimmerman of Texas did it in a 4-3 loss at Baltimore.</p>
        <p>Atlanta and Florida were tied at 2-2 when Paul Bako led off the ninth with a single against Rudy Seanez (1-1). The pinch-runner Bautista advanced to second when first baseman Andres Galarraga mishandled a pickoff throw.</p>
        <p>After the pinch-hitter Dave Berg fouled out attempting to bunt, Luis Castillo grounded out, advancing Bautista to third.</p>
        <p>Rocker then sprinted into the game and intentionally walked the pinch-hitter Mark Smith, bringing Floyd to the plate.</p>
        <p>The Braves lost for the fourth time in five games since winning 15 in a row. They committed three errors and wasted a fine performance by Greg Maddux, who struck out a season-high 10 in seven innings.</p>
        <p>Giants 6, Cardinals 4: Mark McGwire hit the 534th homer of his career, tying him with Jimmie Foxx for ninth on the career list, but it was not enough to keep host San Francisco from winning its seventh straight.</p>
        <p>Bobby Estalella homered twice, including a three-run shot for the Giants. After losing seven of the first eight games at their new Pacific Bell Park, the Giants have won seven straight at home.</p>
        <p>The Cardinals' first run came on a 430-foot homer by McGwire, his 12th of the season. It put him two behind Mickey Mantle on the career list.</p>
        <p>McGwire, who has homered in 9 of his last 14 games, found the right-center-field bleachers with his shot in the sixth inning off Livan Hernandez. It was the 36th major league park in which McGwire has homered, tying Fred McGriff for the career record.</p>
        <p>CUBS 12, BREWERS 11: At Wrigley Field, Shane Andrews hit a run-scoring single with the bases loaded in the bottom of the 10th inning to help Chicago end a four-game losing streak.</p>
        <p>Sammy Sosa and Andrews each hit three-run homers and had four runs batted in. Ricky Gutierrez, Mark Grace and Eric Young added solo shots for the Cubs.</p>
        <p>Jeromy Burnitz hit two homers and Jose Hernandez also connected for the Brewers.</p>
        <p>Burnitz homered to start a four-run rally in the ninth that was capped when Charlie Hayes's two-out, two-run single tied it at 11.</p>
        <p>Diamondbacks 15, Dodgers 7: Arizona Manager Buck Showalter got his 500th career victory as Travis Lee and Andy Fox each had four R.B.I. in Phoenix.</p>
        <p>The Diamondbacks, who won their fifth straight, scored five runs each in the first, fourth and fifth innings, and had 20 hits, tying the team's high for a nine-inning game.</p>
        <p>Arizona, which started play in 1998, set a season high for runs and at 22-10 surpassed Atlanta (21-10) for best record in the National League.</p>
        <p>Showalter, who began his managerial career with the Yankees, improved his career record to  500-437.</p>
        <p>ROCKIES 3, ASTROS 1: Pedro Astacio pitched a three-hitter and Todd Helton hit a two-run homer as visiting Colorado snapped a string of 22 scoreless innings.</p>
        <p>Astacio (4-2) allowed Richard Hidalgo's leadoff homer in the fifth, which hit the top of the left-field wall and bounced over for his 10th home run of the year.</p>
        <p>Astacio, who also gave up Bill Spiers's single in the eighth and Hidalgo's single in the ninth, struck out 10, in his first complete game this season, the 21st of his career.</p>
        <p>The Rockies did not score in the first, tying the team record of 22 consecutive innings set from Aug. 11-14, 1996.</p>
        <p>FERNANDEZ BREATHING EASIER: The Marlins ace Alex Fernandez received good news yesterday when a magnetic resonance imaging exam revealed that a sprained ligament is the reason for his sore elbow.</p>
        <p>As a result, Fernandez is expected to miss only one start.</p>
        <p>The right-hander has made an impressive comeback from rotator cuff surgery that forced him to miss the 1998 season. Fernandez underwent the M.R.I. scan after the elbow bothered him in his last two starts. He is 4-3 with a 3.99 earned run average.</p>
