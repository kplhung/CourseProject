        <p>The on-again off-again federal tax fraud case against Albert J. Pirro Jr., Westchester's most prominent real estate development lawyer, is apparently on again.</p>
        <p>After a series of pretrial setbacks, federal prosecutors said on Friday that they would file a revised indictment related to Mr. Pirro's business dealings with Robert E. Boyle, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.

        <p>The on-again off-again federal tax fraud case against Albert J. Pirro Jr., Westchester's most prominent real estate development lawyer, is apparently on again.</p>
        <p>After a series of pretrial setbacks, federal prosecutors said on Friday that they would file a revised indictment related to Mr. Pirro's business dealings with Robert E. Boyle, executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. But after boisterous complaints by defense lawyers that such a move would delay the trial for months, prosecutors unexpectedly announced today that they would drop that idea and proceed with the 66 other counts against Mr. Pirro and his brother  Anthony G. Pirro.</p>
        <p>''There appears to be at least a significant risk that trial could be delayed for an indefinite period,'' the prosecutors, Elliott B. Jacobson, Cathy Seibel and Justin S. Weddle, wrote in a letter to Judge Barrington D. Parker Jr. of Federal District Court in White Plains. ''Such a delay would not be in the best interests of the parties or the public.''</p>
        <p>Albert Pirro, with Anthony acting as his accountant, is charged with illegally deducting $1 million in personal spending -- including cars, furniture and personal services -- as business expenses. The brothers have blamed each other for the tax mess but say their situation does not constitute criminal misconduct.</p>
        <p>Since the charges were filed in February 1999, the case has been eagerly anticipated as one of the biggest in recent memory here, both because of the brothers' tangled relationship and because Albert Pirro, a powerful Republican lobbyist and ally of Gov. George E. Pataki, is married to the ambitious and popular Westchester district attorney, Jeanine F. Pirro.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pirro has not been charged with wrongdoing. Yet the uncertainty over her husband's fate has clouded her aspirations for higher office. The prosecutors' contention that Mr. Pirro failed to report his relationship with Mr. Boyle on his federal tax filings has only heightened the political drama.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boyle has not been charged with any wrongdoing but has been sued by the state attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, on civil charges related to the same financial transactions involving the Hudson Valley Hospital Center in Peekskill.</p>
        <p>In the original indictment, prosecutors accused Mr. Pirro of failing to report that Mr. Boyle was a partner in a 1991 real estate deal involving the hospital, which Mr. Boyle was chairman of at the time.</p>
        <p>In December, Judge Parker dismissed that charge, saying it was not clear that Mr. Boyle's ''ownership interest'' in one of Mr. Pirro's companies had to be reported. And last Wednesday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, upheld that ruling in a split decision.</p>
        <p>During a testy conference before Judge Parker on Friday, though, prosecutors said they could ''cure the defect'' in the original charge by changing the wording to demonstrate that Mr. Boyle was a shareholder in one of Mr. Pirro's companies -- a relationship that does have to be reported. And while prosecutors said they were confident that a new indictment would pass legal muster, they conceded that the process could drag on.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for both Pirro brothers were unhappy, to put it mildly. So, too, was Judge Parker, who asked prosecutors at one point, ''You don't want to just let this issue go and try the dozens and dozens of other charges?''</p>
        <p>On Friday, the answer was no. Today, the answer was yes, with the caveat that prosecutors could still try to squeeze details of the Pirro-Boyle deal into the trial. But the likelihood, for now, is that opening arguments could begin by early next week.</p>
