        <p>HALF A HEART  By Rosellen Brown  402 pages. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $24.</p>
        <p>Rosellen Brown has long been interested in that place where private concerns intersect with public values, where the personal and the political collide. In ''Civil Wars'' (1984) she depicted the disintegration of a marriage against the backdrop of the civil rights movement. In ''Before and After'' (1992) she examined the fallout from a terrible crime on a family and the community it belongs to. And in her latest novel, ''Half a Heart,'' she looks at the ways in which race affects a woman's relationship with the half-black daughter she hasn't seen in 17 years.</p>

        <p>HALF A HEART  By Rosellen Brown  402 pages. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux. $24.</p>
        <p>Rosellen Brown has long been interested in that place where private concerns intersect with public values, where the personal and the political collide. In ''Civil Wars'' (1984) she depicted the disintegration of a marriage against the backdrop of the civil rights movement. In ''Before and After'' (1992) she examined the fallout from a terrible crime on a family and the community it belongs to. And in her latest novel, ''Half a Heart,'' she looks at the ways in which race affects a woman's relationship with the half-black daughter she hasn't seen in 17 years.</p>
        <p>Although there are moments in ''Half a Heart'' where Ms. Brown's gift for rendering her characters' inner lives shines through, the novel feels far more programmatic than her earlier books, as though she were struggling to execute a paint-by-numbers picture of an unfamiliar subject. Its plot too often wobbles into the predictable; its characters too often behave like stereotypes.</p>
        <p>Many years ago, we learn, Ms. Brown's heroine, Miriam Vener, was a civil rights advocate who moved to Mississippi, had an affair with a black teacher and allowed him to take custody of their baby daughter, Veronica. Since then Miriam has retreated into the monied, bourgeois world of her youth. She is now married to a wealthy doctor, has three lovely children and lives in an opulent house in a gracious Houston suburb where her neighbors have no idea of her secret past.</p>
        <p>''Her friends were given no way to suspect that her children were replacement children,'' Ms. Brown writes, ''her life a replacement life, her love a replacement love. Sometimes she felt as though she lived beside a graveyard that she circled the long way around, holding her breath, to avoid walking through it.''</p>
        <p>The main problem with this novel is that Ms. Brown never makes Miriam's long-ago decision to abandon Veronica remotely plausible. Why would Miriam -- who, we are repeatedly told, is a fiercely liberal-minded woman -- assent to her former boyfriend's argument that she would have difficulty, as a white woman, raising a child of mixed race? Why did she make no effort to retain custody of Veronica or reach a joint-custody agreement? Why did she allow 17 years to pass before making an effort to get in touch with Veronica or see how she was doing? Why, given her and her husband's enormous financial resources, did she make no effort to see whether Veronica needed help paying for school?</p>
        <p>Though she makes vague allusions to Miriam's passivity and shame over having an out-of-wedlock child, Ms. Brown does not provide a persuasive explanation for her heroine's curious behavior. As a result Miriam comes across as a curiously hardhearted woman: a wimp when it comes to fighting for the child she says she loves, a hypocrite when it comes to matters of race.</p>
        <p>Miriam's behavior, once she has reacquainted herself with Veronica, is equally difficult to understand. Ms. Brown writes that she feels ''a kind of liquid joy flooding her veins'' at the prospect of getting Veronica to press charges against a police officer for sexual harassment even though a lawyer tells her that the case is unwinnable, even though Veronica herself worries that such charges would expose her to terrible humiliation. For Miriam, apparently, it is simply a chance to relive the civil rights actions she participated in as a young woman.</p>
        <p>As for Veronica, she is often as unsympathetic as her mother. She has decided to accept Miriam's overtures because she sees her as ''a cash cow'' who can bankroll her college education and acting ambitions. She just has to work ''her way around to getting her hands on the keys to the safe,'' even if that means having to accept a hug here and there. She sees Miriam, so eager to re-establish a mother-daughter bond, as ''desperation on toast.''</p>
        <p>Certainly a compelling story might be told about two such difficult women trying to come to terms with each other, but Ms. Brown repeatedly subverts the emotional through-line of her narrative by setting up sentimental confrontations in which her characters discuss the color of their skin. They consequently seem less like individuals reacting to the social pressures of the world around them than race-obsessed people parroting racial cliches.</p>
        <p>When Veronica tells her father that she wants to go to Stanford, he asks her why she wants to go to ''White Folks' Heaven.'' When Veronica goes on a date with a white boy, she turns to him and says, ''So what can you tell me about black life in this wonderful country?'' And when one of Miriam's old friends from the civil rights days meets Veronica, she thinks, ''It was such a relief to see her brown-sugar skin'' in Miriam's house. ''It was home.''</p>
        <p>While passages devoted to the characters' daily routines are energized by the sort of emotional detail that distinguished Ms. Brown's earlier books, this novel frequently lapses into embarrassingly flabby romance novel prose. Of Miriam's anger, Ms. Brown writes, it ''was building its bonfires on all sides of her, fed by the past, fed by the present, and there was no place in it finally, thank God, for tears.'' And of Miriam's grief after abandoning Veronica, ''She was metal, she was stone, not wood, not anything that had ever breathed or grown or leafed out.''</p>
        <p>Such prose is uncharacteristic of the usually meticulous Ms. Brown, just as this novel feels like an uncharacteristic lapse in her career, a story told more as a melodramatic made-for-television movie than a heartfelt work of fiction.</p>
