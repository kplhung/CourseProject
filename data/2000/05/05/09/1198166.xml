        <p>Adding new drama to a growing police corruption scandal here, police and city officials agreed today with the nation's top civil rights enforcement officer to begin negotiations about long-sought changes in police training and procedures in an effort to avert a federal lawsuit.</p>
        <p>Bill Lann Lee, the acting assistant attorney general for civil rights, briefed local officials on the results of the Justice Department's four-year investigation into allegations of abusive behavior and racial discrimination by Los Angeles officers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee said the inquiry found there was enough evidence of civil rights violations to file a ''pattern and practice discrimination'' suit contending systemic failings. Such a suit could give the federal government final say over major policies of the Los Angeles Police Department.</p>
        <p>After a two-hour meeting, Mr. Lee issued a statement saying the Justice Department was ''willing to defer filing suit to allow the city the opportunity to work toward a voluntary settlement.''</p>
        <p>He said the city had accepted that offer to begin discussing a resolution of the matter and had agreed to schedule a meeting next week.</p>
        <p>Such a lawsuit would be a huge political and legal black eye for the leadership of the nation's second largest city, which is already reeling from charges of brutality, corruption and evidence fabrication that have led to the dismissal or suspension of some 30 officers and the overturning of more than 80 convictions.</p>
        <p>The case became public after a former police officer confessed to handcuffing and shooting an unarmed gang member, then planting a gun near his paralyzed body.</p>
        <p>Federal and local officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Mr. Lee had arrived in Los Angeles with a letter outlining the department's findings. One possible outcome, the officials said, would be for Los Angeles to promise a series of changes, in the form of a consent decree similar to those the Justice Department has already reached with police departments in Pittsburgh and Steubenville, Ohio, and with the New Jersey State Police, where the aim was to bar racial profiling in traffic stops by troopers.</p>
        <p>Los Angeles would be the biggest city to come under such direct federal scrutiny, though the United States Attorney's office in Brooklyn has amassed what officials call evidence of systemwide problems in the New York Police Department's handling of brutality complaints, and is pressing New York for changes with the threat of a similar suit.</p>
        <p>Local officials said that Mr. Lee told them of the meeting only on Friday, and that it had been arranged with such apparent haste that Mayor Richard J. Riordan, a Republican, was not even in town. The city attorney, chief of police, the president of the civilian police commission and representatives of Mr. Riordan did attend the meeting.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department has conducted its inquiry since 1996, centering on excessive use of force by officers, under a 1994 federal law that authorized federal prosecutors to go to court to seek changes in the operations of local departments.</p>
        <p>It was inspired by a tumultuous period here that saw the beating of a black motorist, Rodney King, the subsequent acquittal of police officers charged in the case and the resulting riots that tore the city apart in 1992. In the wake of the King case, a blue-ribbon commission recommended a host of changes in department policy, including a new system for tracking ''problem'' officers who amassed large numbers of misconduct complaints.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department allocated money to help finance the system, but in recent months it has become clear that efforts to establish it fell victim to bureaucratic errors, infuriating Justice officials.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, last fall, the police and local district attorney made public their own sweeping investigations into contentions of evidence-tampering, false testimony and brutality among officers in the gritty Rampart division on the western edge of downtown, in the city's worst corruption case in half a century. As that inquiry has grown, it has led to bitter infighting between Police Chief Bernard Parks and District Attorney Gil Garcetti, with Mr. Riordan at one point reduced to accusing them of behaving like children.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department's investigation had failed to uncover the Rampart case, which local officials here said left the federal government feeling pressure to step up its inquiry. In March, Mr. Lee told local officials that the department was ratcheting up its civil rights investigation. But according to one city official, Mr. Lee said then that the federal government had ''no interest in running the department,'' though the Justice Department had a ''role to play'' in helping introduce reforms that had worked in other police departments around the country.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 11, 2000, Thursday  An article on Tuesday about a federal investigation into accusations of misconduct and civil rights violations by the Los Angeles Police Department referred imprecisely to the grounds of a lawsuit the Justice Department has threatened to bring if the city does not change training and procedures. The suit would assert a pattern and practice of police misconduct. The Justice Department is still reviewing accusations of racial discrimination and has made no conclusion on that issue.</p>
