        <p>In a major expansion into the United States Internet market, NTT Communications of Japan said today that it had agreed to acquire Verio Inc., a Web site manager based in Englewood, Colo., for $5.5 billion in cash.</p>
        <p>The move is part of an aggressive new strategy by NTT Communications, a subsidiary of Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, to expand globally, particularly across Asia, America and Europe. NTT Communications currently holds a 10 percent stake in Verio.</p>
        <p>The deal to buy the rest, worth $60 a share, represents a 67 percent premium over Verio's share price at the close of stock trading on Friday.</p>
        <p>In extremely heavy trading on the Nasdaq market today, when most technology shares in the United States fell sharply, Verio surged $22.375, or 62.3 percent, to $58.3125.  Earlier in Tokyo, Nippon Telegraph rose 2.8 percent, to 1.46 million yen, or about $13,390.</p>
        <p>The NTT Communications deal for Verio would be one of the largest cash purchases of an Internet services company. Such acquisitions in the Internet industry are usually settled with stock. It is also one of the biggest Japanese purchases of an American company.</p>
        <p>Analysts applauded the deal, saying that by acquiring Verio, NTT Communications, a domestic and international telephone carrier, would gain an important beachhead in the highly competitive, fast-expanding Internet market in the United States.</p>
        <p>''This is a very positive move because Verio will gain a well-established local presence in the United States that will allow NTT to offer higher value-added services and expand its customer base,'' said Hironobu Sawake, a senior analyst for ING Barings Securities in Tokyo.</p>
        <p>Analysts said NTT Communications' willingness to pay such a high premium for Verio was an indication that the company was serious about becoming a major player in the world telecommunications market, though it came to the game late.</p>
        <p>Verio, founded in 1996, is one of the largest operators of Web sites for businesses with an emphasis on serving small and midsize customers. The company offers nearly 400,000 sites in 127 countries, including 14,000 sites for electronic commerce.</p>
        <p>Satoshi Fujita, a senior vice president at NTT Communications, said in an interview that the combined Internet-telephone company would give ''U.S. dot-com companies a bridge to the Asia-Pacific region and Asia dot-com companies a reliable vertical access to the United States.''</p>
        <p>NTT Communications has been expanding its global network primarily in Asia since it was created last year.</p>
        <p>It has invested about $1 billion in the Asia-Pacific region on a variety of interests, including stakes in StarHub, one of Singapore's largest Internet carriers; Philippines Long Distance Telephone; Davnet Telecommunications, an Australian Internet service provider; and HK Net, a Hong Kong Internet concern.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujita, asked about NTT Communications' plans for further acquisitions, said: ''It would be correct to say that we are not finished. Certainly we need to have more capability in the global arena.''</p>
        <p>The executive said that although NTT Communications might have been slow in its international expansion, the communications industry is changing so rapidly that ''the incumbent may not necessarily be the winner.''</p>
        <p>Under the agreement to acquire Verio, a United States subsidiary of NTT Communications will make a tender offer no later than May 17 to merge Verio with the Japanese carrier. The company said it hoped to complete the transaction by the third quarter of this year and that it planned no layoffs at Verio, which has about 2,000 employees.</p>
