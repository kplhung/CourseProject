        <p>Re: ''Sniffing Out Relatives, for Survival's Sake'' (May 2):</p>
        <p>When one of my grandsons was born, my daughter told me frequently that he smelled delicious. As I held our newborn, I agreed that his smell was great.</p>
        <p>Shortly after that, as I was resting with my head on my bare arm, I smelled the aroma of my own skin. It was quite similar to that of the baby. No wonder his smell seemed so wonderful. It was mine!</p>
