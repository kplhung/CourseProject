        <p>Darrin Fletcher hit a grand slam in the fourth inning as the Toronto Blue Jays beat the visiting Baltimore Orioles for the 11th straight time, 6-5, last night.</p>
        <p>Tony Batista also homered for the Blue Jays, who have hit 48 homers in 19 home games and are on pace to finish with 207, which would shatter the major league home record of 149 set by Colorado at Coors Field in 1996.</p>
        <p>Fletcher's fifth career slam gave Toronto a 6-2 lead. After Jason Johnson (0-2) loaded the bases in the fourth inning on singles by Carlos Delgado and Batista and a walk to Brad Fullmer, Fletcher homered to right center.</p>
        <p>Batista's two-run shot in the second had put the Blue Jays ahead,  2-0. Five of Fletcher's six home runs, and seven of Batista's nine homers have come at SkyDome.</p>
        <p>Baltimore has lost five of six over all, and 12 straight in Toronto. The Orioles closed to 6-5 in the eighth on run-scoring singles by Mike Bordick and Albert Belle, but Billy Koch got three outs for his eighth save, striking out Bordick to end the game with a runner on second. Bordick was 3 for 4.</p>
        <p>ROYALS 4, TIGERS 1: Jermaine Dye hit a two-run double in the 11th inning and Kansas City beat Detroit, snapping the Royals' nine-game road losing streak.</p>
        <p>Rey Sanchez singled off Doug Brocail (1-2) to start the 11th and Johnny Damon sacrificed. With two outs, Mike Sweeney beat out an infield hit.</p>
        <p>Dye followed with a line drive over right fielder Luis Polonia and the ball rolled to the wall as Sanchez and Sweeney scored. Danny Patterson relieved and was greeted by Mark Quinn's run-scoring single.</p>
        <p>Detroit's Juan Encarnacion ended his 19-game hitting streak, tops in the majors, going hitless in five at-bats.</p>
        <p>Both starters pitched nine innings, giving up one run apiece -- each on solo homers -- on a combined seven hits.</p>
        <p>RED SOX 3, WHITE SOX 2: Brian Rose, who failed to get out of the second in two of his other four starts, pitched six strong innings and Carl Everett homered as Boston won at home over Chicago.</p>
        <p>Rose (2-2) started with three perfect innings and left after six with a 3-2 lead after allowing just four hits and no walks. He began the game with a 9.20 earned run.</p>
        <p>Derek Lowe pitched one and a third innings for his eighth save in eight chances, lowering his E.R.A. to 0.87 in 20 innings. After Paul Konerko's leadoff single and a sacrifice, Carlos Lee grounded out, Greg Norton walked and the pinch-hitter Herbert Perry bounced into a forceout.</p>
        <p>Boston won for the sixth time in eight games. Chicago, which leads the American League Central, has lost seven of eight.</p>
        <p>RANGERS 10, MARINERS 1: Rick Helling pitched six shutout innings and Chad Curtis drove in three runs as Texas beat visiting Seattle.</p>
        <p>Royce Clayton led off the Texas first with a triple and the Rangers went ahead for good with three runs, highlighted by Curtis's two-run single.</p>
        <p>Jason McDonald had a leadoff homer in the second, and Mike Lamb scored after hitting doubles to start the fourth and sixth innings. Clayton homered to open the eighth.</p>
        <p>Helling (4-1) allowed just three singles before he left with swelling on his pitching hand, a result of being hit by a comebacker that ended the second. He struck out three and walked just one.</p>
        <p>In his previous start last Tuesday, Helling allowed just one hit in seven and one-third innings against Tampa Bay, an 8-1 victory. He has worked at least six innings in six straight starts after going just three and a third innings on April 4.</p>
        <p>After Clayton's leadoff triple in the first, Luis Alicea had a run-scoring single on the next pitch by Brett Tomko (1-2). After consecutive walks loaded the bases, Curtis singled with two outs.</p>
        <p>INDIANS 3, TWINS 2: Manny Ramirez's run-scoring single off Bob Wells with two outs in the 10th gave Cleveland the victory over host Minnesota.</p>
        <p>Wells (0-3) gave up a one-out double to Omar Vizquel before striking out David Justice. He had two strikes on Ramirez, who poked a single up the middle, scoring Vizquel from second.</p>
        <p>Ricardo Rincon (2-0) got the victory, striking out the only batter he faced -- Corey Koskie looking -- to end the ninth with runners at first and second.</p>
        <p>Steve Karsay pitched the 10th for his seventh save. The Indians won their third in a row following a six-game losing streak.</p>
        <p>Both starting pitchers, Dave Burba and Brad Radke, had terrific games but lacked run support.</p>
        <p>Burba scattered six singles and struck out a season-best 10, including Matthew LeCroy three times, in seven and one-third innings. But he tired with one out in the eighth, issuing back-to-back walks to Cristian Guzman and Koskie before Matt Lawton's run-scoring single cut Cleveland's lead to 2-1.</p>
        <p>Sean DePaula relieved Burba and got Ron Coomer on a popout to second before the pinch-hitter David Ortiz's single tied it.</p>
        <p>Radke threw eight solid innings, striking out a season-high nine, including Richie Sexson three times. Sexson, who entered the night on a 9-for-16 streak, also grounded into a double play in the eighth.</p>
        <p>Roberto Alomar homered, and his brother, Sandy, a six-time All-Star catcher, returned from the 15-day disabled list, called a superb game and doubled his first time up.</p>
        <p>Sandy Alomar, who was hitting .310 when he pulled his right hamstring last month, doubled in the second and scored on Jolbert Cabrera's single for a 1-0 lead.</p>
        <p>His rust showed up in the third, however, when Guzman stole second and took third on Alomar's bad throw, which skittered into center field. Guzman was stranded when Jay Canizaro struck out.</p>
        <p>Roberto Alomar led off the fifth with his fifth homer for a 2-0 lead.</p>
