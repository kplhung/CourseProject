        <p>President Clinton has pleaded with an Arkansas disciplinary panel not to take away his law license, arguing that he has been a good public servant and insisting again that he did not technically lie before a federal judge, according to court papers filed by his opponents.</p>
        <p>In an 80-page brief, backed by hundreds of pages of exhibits, Mr. Clinton and his lawyers provided the first glimpse of how they will argue that he is still fit to practice law even though he was found in contempt of court.</p>
        <p>In the brief, Mr. Clinton maintains that his answers under oath denying a sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky were technically accurate. Much of the brief, in fact, is an effort to press yet again his claim that he was truthful in saying he had not engaged in sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky because the oral sex in which they engaged did not fit the definition of sexual relations that had been approved by the judge in the case, Susan Webber Wright.</p>
        <p>At the same time, he said in the brief that his more than 20 years of public service should persuade the panel to be lenient and not impose any sanction harsher than a reprimand.</p>
        <p>The panel, the Committee on Professional Conduct of the Arkansas Supreme Court, is set to decide as early as this month whether to discipline Mr. Clinton by revoking or suspending his license or by imposing a lesser penalty, like a letter of reprimand.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's brief in the disciplinary case was not disclosed, but portions of it were reproduced in the opposing brief filed by the Southeastern Legal Foundation, a conservative group based in Atlanta that has been pressing Arkansas to revoke Mr. Clinton's license to practice law.</p>
        <p>Matthew Glavin, the director of the Southeastern Legal Foundation, said he was disclosing his organization's brief, and urged Mr. Clinton and his lawyers to do the same.</p>
        <p>But David E. Kendall, Mr. Clinton's lawyer, declined to do so today. Mr. Kendall did not take issue with Mr. Glavin's account of the Clinton brief, but in a statement, he criticized Mr. Glavin and his organization for releasing the group's brief, asserting that the action was part of a long-running partisan campaign against Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''The foundation isn't interested in issues relating to Arkansas lawyers and legal services,'' he said. ''It's just interested in attacking the president any way it can.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kendall said Richard Mellon Scaife had given the foundation money, and Kenneth W. Starr had helped raise funds for it. Mr. Scaife, a reclusive billionaire, has donated millions of dollars to anti-Clinton causes; until last fall, Mr. Starr was the Whitewater prosecutor whose report of Mr. Clinton's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky resulted in the president's impeachment by the House in 1998.</p>
        <p>The disciplinary case involves Mr. Clinton's statements under oath on Jan. 17, 1998, when he gave a deposition in the sexual misconduct lawsuit brought against him by Paula Corbin Jones.</p>
        <p>In the presence of Judge Wright, who was presiding over the civil lawsuit, Mr. Clinton said he had never engaged in a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky and he denied that he had ever been alone with her but for a fleeting moment.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Clinton acknowledged in August 1998 that he had had an improper physical relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, Judge Wright ruled that his behavior constituted contempt of court.</p>
        <p>''The president,'' she said, ''deliberately violated this court's discovery orders, thereby undermining the integrity of the judicial system.'' She said that ''sanctions must be imposed to redress the president's misconduct and to deter others who might consider emulating the president's misconduct.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Glavin said the bar's disciplinary rules did not require that Mr. Clinton had lied, only that he had been purposely deceptive. Mr. Glavin said the president had already admitted to that by saying that he misled the public and the authorities with his comments about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kendall had asked the disciplinary committee in March to postpone its consideration of the case until after Mr. Clinton left office, but the committee rejected that proposal.</p>
