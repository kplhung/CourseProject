        <p>Though it is on the defensive militarily, the Sri Lankan government tonight firmly rejected a separatist Tamil group's offer of a cease-fire in exchange for the government's promise to withdraw tens of thousands of its troops from the northern Jaffna peninsula.</p>
        <p>The government's director of information, Ariya Rubasinghe, confirmed tonight that the government had no intention of pulling out of the small peninsula at the country's northern tip.</p>
        <p>President Chandrika Kumaratunga, who survived an assassination attempt by a separatist suicide bomber, did not refer to the cease-fire offer in a nationally televised address, but said the government would stay and fight the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The rebel group has been labeled a terrorist organization by the United States.</p>
        <p>The patch that had covered Mrs. Kumaratunga's eye, injured in the December assassination attempt, was gone tonight when she declared in Sinhalese, ''We shall leave no room for the L.T.T.E. to again fasten their fascist grip on half a million Tamil people in Jaffna.''</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Kumaratunga's decision was a risky one. The Tigers have been on a successful military march to reclaim Jaffna, the cultural capital of the Hindu Tamil-dominated north in this majority Buddhist Sinhalese nation. For the first time in the 18-year-old civil war -- which has claimed more than 60,000 lives in a country with a population no larger than New York State's -- the rebels control Elephant Pass, which an opposition leader has called the doorway to the fortress of Jaffna.</p>
        <p>Since 1995, the government has controlled Jaffna, but for five years before that the Tigers, who seek a separate Tamil homeland, ran what was essentially a small state there.</p>
        <p>Elephant Pass is a narrow strip of land connecting the mainland to the peninsula and the site of one of the most heavily fortified military bases in the country. On April 22, the rebels took the pass. Experts say that with the Tigers in control of the pass, it will be very difficult for the government to defend Jaffna.</p>
        <p>Last week, the government banned political rallies and union strikes and tightened a vise of press censorship in what it said was an effort to protect national security, but that the opposition said was an attempt by the government to hide the government's own failings.</p>
        <p>The Tigers said today in a statement from their London office that they were willing to observe a cease-fire once the government surrenders Jaffna, which the rebels said could open the way to peace talks.</p>
        <p>The rebels said the government's  rejection of the offer could lead to ''disastrous consequences of heavy military casualties.''</p>
        <p>Fears of a large force of demoralized government troops' being trapped on the Jaffna peninsula and hostage to the Tigers have led some  here to hope that India, the region's great power, would intervene.</p>
        <p>India's prime minister, Atal Behari Vajpayee, met today with the leaders of 20 political parties to discuss the conflict in Sri Lanka.</p>
        <p>India has a much larger Tamil population than Sri Lanka in the politically potent southern state of Tamil Nadu. And India supported Sri Lankan Tamil militants, including the Tigers, in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>But India has to worry about stirring nationalist feeling among its own Tamil citizens. And both Sri Lanka and India have an interest in holding together their ethnically and religiously diverse nations.</p>
        <p>So today, India ruled out military intervention, though it was not clear that it would refuse to help evacuate troops. In the late 1980's, India lost more than 1,000 troops on a long peacekeeping mission in Sri Lanka.</p>
        <p>The parliamentary affairs minister, Pramod Mahajan, said after the  meeting today that India would only consider mediating between the Tigers and the Sri Lankan government if both sides wanted Indian help.</p>
        <p>The role of mediator had fallen earlier this year to Norway, one of the nations the Tigers had deemed an acceptable intermediary.</p>
        <p>The Sri Lankan political opposition leader, Ranil Wickremesinghe, said in an interview tonight that he believed that Norway and India might work together to try to broker a deal.</p>
        <p>The bitter feuding between Mrs. Kumaratunga and Mr. Wickremesinghe, who heads the United National Party, has been an important element in a failed attempt to get a  peace plan through Parliament. The opposition had opposed the government's attempt to change the Constitution to give the Tamils greater autonomy in the north.</p>
        <p>Lately, Mrs. Kumaratunga and Mr. Wickremesinghe have been having their own peace talks, but any agreement they reach may be overtaken by military developments that -- up to now -- are tilting in the Tigers' favor.</p>
