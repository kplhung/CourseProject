        <p>More than seven years after the broccoli-bashing presidency of George Bush, vegetables and fruit still have not caught on with the public, despite the health benefits.</p>
        <p>Fewer than one-fourth of Americans eat the five daily servings of fruit and vegetables recommended by federal health officials and the National Cancer Institute, a survey has found.</p>
        <p>The report, published in a recent issue of The American Journal of Public Health, found that some progress had been made in the period studied, 1990 to 1996.</p>
        <p>In the first year, only 19 percent of Americans reported eating five servings a day; in the last, 22.7 percent did.</p>
        <p>But most of that improvement, the researchers said, took place before 1994, and a leveling off has since occurred.</p>
        <p>The survey, conducted in 16 states, involved telephone calls to up to 32,000 people a year. They were asked six questions, including how often they drank juice or ate fruit. They were also asked how often they ate potatoes (French fries and potato chips did not count).</p>
        <p>Those interviewed were also asked about exercise.</p>
        <p>The highest proportion of people who met the dietary recommendations were men and women 65 and older, whites, college graduates and people who exercised.</p>
        <p>''Although progress from 1990 to 1994 was encouraging,'' the report said, the survey suggested that further efforts were needed, especially among inactive and obese people.</p>
