        <p>Around the besieged provincial legislature building here, the din of banging pots died away, candles flickered in the evening breeze and protesters began singing their hymn: ''Oh Medicare.''</p>
        <p>''Long live our plan, keep it free from greed,'' hundreds of voices sang into the spring night. Referring to the health care plan for all Canadians, they sang, ''Oh Medicare, we stand on guard for thee.''</p>
        <p>As North Americans wrestle with mounting health bills for aging populations, many people in this free-market-oriented province are backing a health care model that has fallen out of fashion of late: a government-administered national health plan.</p>
        <p>Since Canada put most of its health care under government control in the late 1960's, many Canadians have lauded the program as evidence that they enjoy a more beneficent society than the United States, where about 45 million people do not have health insurance. Asserting their system's superiority, Canadians note that life expectancy here is higher than in the United States, 75.8 years for Canadian men, and 81.4 years for women, according to government statistics for people born in 1997, the latest year available. Life expectancy in the United States that year was 73.6 for men and 79.4 for women, federal statistics show.</p>
        <p>But in recent years, the image of Canada's universal health system has been tarnished by negative developments: waiting lists stretching for months for cancer treatment and heart surgery, Canadians pulling strings to get faster and better treatment in a state rationed system, and thousands of doctors and nurses emigrating to the United States for better salaries and working conditions. In a recent survey by the Angus Reid polling organization, 8 in 10 respondents out of 1,500 Canadians interviewed said the nation's health care system was in ''crisis.''</p>
        <p>With other opinion polls indicating that Canadians view health care as the nation's top issue, Ralph Klein, the popular premier of Alberta, unveiled a bill in March that Americans might consider cautious. After a preamble outlawing ''private hospitals,'' the bill goes on to allow overnight stays in ''surgical clinics.''</p>
        <p>''It is touching the so-called third rail; it is opening up the debate on health care,'' Mr. Klein, a Conservative, said on Tuesday as he wearily prepared for an eighth night of protesters outside the legislature, chanting ''Kill the bill.''</p>
        <p>Under the bill, expected to be passed on May 11, the government would reimburse private clinics for performing the same surgeries performed in government hospitals.</p>
        <p>At a rally Tuesday night, attended by about 500 people, there were two common themes: that Canada's socialized medical system had faltered because conservative  governments had starved it of cash, and that private ''surgical clinics'' would open the door for the ''Americanization'' of Canadian health care.</p>
        <p>''The politicians create the problem with delays and waiting lists, then they come up with the answer: ''We are going to privatize it,'' Andrew Dorosh, a 64-year-old retired social worker, said as banners waved reading, ''People, Not Profits'' and ''Our Health Isn't for Sale.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Klein's efforts to chip away at the government health monopoly have won national attention, in part because Alberta, a province with a pro-business government, has set much of Canada's financial policy agenda in recent years, slashing taxes and erasing budget deficits.</p>
        <p>Few people question that Canada, like much of the Western world, faces a looming health care crisis. About half of all hospital days now go to people over 65, a group expected to double in 30 years.</p>
        <p>But the surprise here has been the dogged loyalty of Albertans to their public health system. In a recent poll for The Calgary Herald, a conservative newspaper, 52 percent of Albertans opposed the health bill. Only 40 percent supported it.</p>
        <p>''This is the first time I have seen a sustained protest against a piece of legislation in 20 years in this province,'' Nancy MacBeth, provincial leader of the opposition Liberal Party, said in an interview. Referring to this conservative province of ranchers, oil workers and high tech engineers, sometimes called the Texas of Canada, she added: ''Albertans don't tend to protest. It is not our nature.''</p>
        <p>As part of an effort to balance budgets, Canada cut the number of its hospital beds by 28 percent over the last decade, to 125,863 in 1999. In Alberta, beds were cut by one-third, to 12,502 last year.</p>
        <p>At the same time, on the theory that more doctors generate more medical spending, Canada restricted the number of medical school students in the 1990's by 20 percent. Faced with higher workloads, 4,000 Canadian doctors and 6,000 nurses moved to the United States over the last decade.</p>
        <p>Now, with tax revenue up because of Canada's economic recovery, Ottawa plans to inject an additional $3 billion a year into provincial health care.</p>
        <p>In Canada, the public sector accounts for about 70 percent of $60 billion in annual health care spending, slightly down from 75 percent when the program began three decades ago. Private spending largely goes for dental care, optional eye care and drugs.</p>
        <p>But talk of allowing more private participation in health care immediately sets off alarms. After Barbara Amiel, a columnist for Maclean's, the leading national news weekly, wrote an essay titled ''Why We Need Private Medicine,'' she was immediately barraged with 130 e-mail messages and letters, almost all hostile.</p>
        <p>At the rally Tuesday, a sign bobbed above the crowd: ''This is not the U.S.A.''</p>
