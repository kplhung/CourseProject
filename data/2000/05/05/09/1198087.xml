        <p>Luck Insurance</p>
        <p>With hair the color of whipped butter and a frame that makes her look like a cross between Betty Page and a guard for the W.N.B.A., Sophie Dahl is the kind of young woman who doesn't catch the eye so much as imprison it. Still, when she discovered last fall that the photographer Steven Meisel would attend a party she was planning to be at, she didn't want to be overlooked.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dahl, who is English and divides her time between New York and London, first had to get a new dress for the event because a garment bag containing her Manhattan evening wear had just been stolen. A friend bought her a new Gucci, she explained recently at an East Side dinner she attended with the actor Griffin Dunne. The night of the December party, held in conjunction with the opening of the LVMH Tower, she purposefully danced in front of Mr. Meisel in her new dress to get his attention. She succeeded. Mr. Meisel photographed her for two Italian Vogue covers.</p>

        <p>Luck Insurance</p>
        <p>With hair the color of whipped butter and a frame that makes her look like a cross between Betty Page and a guard for the W.N.B.A., Sophie Dahl is the kind of young woman who doesn't catch the eye so much as imprison it. Still, when she discovered last fall that the photographer Steven Meisel would attend a party she was planning to be at, she didn't want to be overlooked.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dahl, who is English and divides her time between New York and London, first had to get a new dress for the event because a garment bag containing her Manhattan evening wear had just been stolen. A friend bought her a new Gucci, she explained recently at an East Side dinner she attended with the actor Griffin Dunne. The night of the December party, held in conjunction with the opening of the LVMH Tower, she purposefully danced in front of Mr. Meisel in her new dress to get his attention. She succeeded. Mr. Meisel photographed her for two Italian Vogue covers.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dahl, granddaughter of the writer Roald Dahl, has since had her stalled modeling career jump-started. Last month Ms. Dahl, a size 12, appeared in Jane magazine. ''We agreed to have someone who wasn't real thin,'' Laura Ferrara, a Jane editor, said. ''She's so totally sexy.''</p>
        <p>Ten days ago, Ms. Dahl was photographed for Alexander McQueen's first-ever ad campaign, which will run this September. This fall she will also star as the new Versace Jeans model, another role for which she can thank Mr. Meisel, who photographed the campaign. As the Versace Jeans model, Ms. Dahl replaces Gisele Bunchen.</p>
        <p>The Merry-Go-Round of Time</p>
        <p>At a suite at the Carlyle Hotel last week, Luisa Beccaria stood surrounded by pictures of her children, Lucilla, Lucrezia, Ludovico, Luna and Luchino, as she sold her line of chiffon blouses and Chanel-ish suits to buyers who haven't always been interested. ''It looked old,'' the Hong Kong retailer Joyce Ma said of Ms. Beccaria's past work. ''But now it's the right time.'' She was ordering Ms. Beccaria's clothes for the first time.</p>
        <p>Ms. Beccaria, who looks something like a Victorian-era Charlotte Rampling, is a beneficiary of the current embrace of the ladylike. Ms. Beccaria has had a store in Milan since 1991, where she lives when she isn't at her 18th-century Sicilian home. In the last few years she showed her clothes at the shop in small presentations during Milan fashion week, but few non-Italians turned up. ''They'd give me the worst times,'' she said of her slot on the Milan calendar. ''No one came.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Beccaria designed evening wear for years before she began focusing on day clothes for well-heeled customers in 1997. A year earlier, she turned down the job as head designer at Chloe because the house asked her to spend half the month in Paris. ''I was frightened to lose my husband, my children, my business,'' she said. But the offer made Ms. Beccaria think commercially.</p>
        <p>Linda Dresner was among the retailers to visit Ms. Beccaria last week. Now she is picking up various pieces for the first time, for fall delivery. So too is the Cross in London; Bergdorf Goodman and Saks Fifth Avenue have expressed interest.</p>
        <p>Ghost in Manhattan</p>
        <p>In the same week that Rebecca Dannenberg announced that she was closing her business, and a few days before Susan Lazar revealed she was terminating her line to start a smaller one, another label whose hipness has also declined, forged on, clinking glasses and all. The British label Ghost, designed by Tanya Sarne and famously worn by models in the 1990's, opened its first New York shop, 4,000 square feet on Bond Street.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sarne, who has Ghost shops in Europe and Los Angeles, said she felt she needed to ''practice'' before venturing into Manhattan. ''I don't know if it has the same cachet anymore,'' said the stylist Lisa Marie Fernandez, who picked a Ghost dress from the rack and put it on for the party.</p>
        <p>At Ultimo in Chicago, where Ghost is sold, a clerk, Jamie Kesnicki, said, ''It doesn't have a huge, huge following,'' but keeps a loyal customer. ''Fashionwise,'' she said, ''they haven't kept up with current looks as well as they could have.''</p>
