        <p>Moving to offer digital television service throughout the Southeast,  BellSouth intends to announce today that it has signed a long-term contract to purchase satellite services from General Electric, an executive close to the deal said yesterday.</p>
        <p>BellSouth had been rumored to be in discussions with Loral Space and Communications, a G.E. rival in the satellite industry.</p>
        <p>It was not clear yesterday exactly why BellSouth, the Southeast's dominant local telephone carrier, instead chose General Electric's Americom division. Americom, however, says it operates the biggest satellite fleet in North America, with at least a dozen satellites. The executive close to the deal said that G.E. had committed itself to launching a new satellite to be used primarily by BellSouth.</p>
        <p>While BellSouth and G.E. do not expect to announce financial terms or the specific length of the contract today, BellSouth does intend to announce plans to offer satellite television service by the first half of 2002 to the 14 million households it already serves, the executive said.</p>
        <p>A BellSouth spokesman and a G.E. spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>
        <p>BellSouth, which recently agreed to fold its wireless telephone unit into a joint venture with SBC Communications, currently sells television service to about 120,000 households in 11 Southeastern markets. That operation uses a combination of wired and ground-based wireless systems, but the company apparently believed that only satellite technology would allow BellSouth to compete against cable television operators across the company's region.</p>
        <p>Last July, SBC announced a wide-ranging marketing partnership with DirecTV Inc., which is a subsidiary of General Motors.</p>
        <p>But while that deal merely allowed SBC to distribute DirecTV's services, BellSouth seems to be taking a more hands-on approach. G.E. does not currently market satellite television directly to United States consumers. The new service will bear only the BellSouth brand, an executive close to the deal said, adding that BellSouth had not yet selected a contractor to manufacture the necessary satellite dishes.</p>
