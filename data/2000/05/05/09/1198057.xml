        <p>A struggling new musical, ''The Wild Party,'' received seven nominations, including one for best musical; a mother and daughter were pitted against each other in a leading-actress category; and two actors who alternate roles in ''True West'' wound up competitors when the Tony Award nominations were announced yesterday.</p>

        <p>A struggling new musical, ''The Wild Party,'' received seven nominations, including one for best musical; a mother and daughter were pitted against each other in a leading-actress category; and two actors who alternate roles in ''True West'' wound up competitors when the Tony Award nominations were announced yesterday.</p>
        <p>Nine days ago, ''The Wild Party,'' which opened last month to mixed reviews after a version by the Manhattan Theater Club ended its run, was selling at just 50 percent capacity. Some people expected it to close if it was not nominated for best musical. But its seven nominations, only one less than for the acclaimed revival of ''The Music Man,'' have given it a new lease on life, at least until the awards are announced on June 4.</p>
        <p>''I feel really fabulous,'' said George C. Wolfe, the director and a co-producer of ''The Wild Party,'' who wrote the musical with Michael John LaChiusa. ''It's the Broadway community embracing new work.''</p>
        <p>Mr. LaChiusa, who also wrote ''Marie Christine,'' had a big day yesterday, with both of his shows drawing nominations for best book for a musical and best original score, although neither has been a hit. ''Marie Christine'' closed in January.</p>
        <p>''Kiss Me Kate'' led the nominations, announced at Sardi's restaurant, with 12 nods in categories from best musical revival to best orchestration.</p>
        <p>The Tony nominations pointed up the increasingly gray area of what constitutes a new musical these days, given that the three shows nominated with ''Wild Party'' in the best musical category defy conventional definitions. They are ''Contact,'' a dance play performed to recorded music whose eligibility has prompted protest from the musicians union, Local 802; ''James Joyce's 'The Dead,' '' a play with parlor songs that recently closed; and ''Swing!,'' a dance show. ''Aida,'' a more traditional musical, was not nominated for best musical, although it received five other nominations.</p>
        <p>The races that promise to be particularly close are for best play, best revival of a musical and best performance by a leading actor in a play. In the best play category, the acclaimed production of Michael Frayn's ''Copenhagen'' will compete with ''Dirty Blonde'' by Claudia Shear; Sam Shepard's ''True West,'' which successfully lobbied for consideration as a new play although it was previously produced off Broadway in 1980 and 1982; and ''The Ride Down Mount Morgan'' by Arthur Miller, which recently earned attention when its star, Patrick Stewart, complained from the stage about what he considered inadequate promotion by its producers, the Shubert Organization. Mr. Stewart was not nominated.</p>
        <p>The race for musical revival has heated up since ''The Music Man'' opened on April 27, creating head-to-head competition with ''Kiss Me, Kate,'' which opened in the fall. The two musicals are also vying for awards for best performance by a leading actor in a musical (Brian Stokes Mitchell for ''Kiss Me, Kate'' and Craig Bierko for ''The Music Man'') and for best performance by a leading actress in a musical (Rebecca Luker for ''The Music Man'' versus Marin Mazzie for ''Kiss Me, Kate'').</p>
        <p>The competition for best actor is complicated by the nominations of both Philip Seymour Hoffman and John C. Reilly for their performances in ''True West,'' despite efforts by the play's producers to have the actors, who alternate roles every three performances, considered jointly as one candidate. The two actors are up against Gabriel Byrne  for ''A Moon for the Misbegotten;'' Stephen Dillane for ''The Real Thing''; and David Suchet for ''Amadeus,'' all of whom received strong reviews.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's nominations for the Tony Awards, which are presented by the American Theater Wing and the League of American Theaters and Producers, found some shows competing against themselves. For best performance by a featured actress in a musical, for example, Laura Benanti and Ann Hampton Callaway were nominated from ''Swing!,'' and Deborah Yates and Karen Ziemba were nominated from ''Contact.'' Also in that category was Eartha Kitt, nominated for ''The Wild Party.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, Kevin Chamberlain and Bob Stillman of ''Dirty Blonde'' are competing against each other for best performance by a featured actor in a play.</p>
        <p>Susan Stroman will be competing against herself for best direction of a musical and for best choreography, having been nominated in both categories for both ''Contact'' and ''The Music Man.''</p>
        <p>The director Michael Blakemore also received two nominations, though in different categories, one for ''Kiss Me, Kate'' and one for ''Copenhagen.'' The last time this happened was 10 years ago, also to Mr. Blakemore, although he won for neither his direction of the musical ''City of Angels'' nor of the play ''Lettice and Lovage.''</p>
        <p>For best actress in a play, Rosemary Harris, nominated for ''Waiting in the Wings,'' is competing with her daughter, Jennifer Ehle, nominated for ''The Real Thing.''</p>
        <p>Two musicals that have closed each received five nominations: ''James Joyce's 'The Dead' '' and ''Marie Christine.''</p>
        <p>Elton John was nominated for the ''Aida'' score and the show received three other nominations (for its star, Heather Headley, and for Bob Crowley for its scenery and for Natasha Katz for lighting ). Julie Taymor's ''The Green Bird'' received only two nominations, one for best costumes (Constance Hoffman) and one for best performance by a featured actor in a play (Derek Smith).</p>
        <p>The first hour of design and creative awards will be broadcast on PBS on June 4 at 8 P.M.. The remaining two hours will be broadcast on CBS from Radio City Music Hall with Rosie O'Donnell as host.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 10, 2000, Wednesday  An article yesterday about the Tony Award nominations referred incorrectly to the previous occurrence of multiple nominations for a single director in different categories. Michael Blakemore, with two such nominations this year, was similarly nominated 10 years ago, but the most recent case was that of Michael Mayer, nominated last year for both the musical ''You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown'' and the play ''Side Man.''</p>
