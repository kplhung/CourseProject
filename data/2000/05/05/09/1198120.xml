        <p>Gov. Christine Todd Whitman officially broke ground today on a much-debated  light rail line between Camden and Trenton that will initially carry about 4,150 riders a day.</p>
        <p>The $603 million cost of the project is to be paid entirely by the state.</p>
        <p>Officials said they helped keep the cost down by designing the line to share all but 4 of its 34 miles of track with Conrail at a cost of $67 million. Conrail will continue to use the track from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., when the light rail line will not operate.</p>
        <p>Officials estimate ridership could double within 20 years.</p>
        <p>The project, expected to be finished in 2002, was promoted more as an economic development tool for Camden and Trenton -- largely bypassed by nearly a decade of economic growth -- than as a solution to heavy commuter demands in Mercer, Burlington or Camden Counties, where trains are to run on a route roughly along the Delaware River.</p>
        <p>Mainly because of its high cost relative to the modest number of passengers it is estimated to serve, the project has attracted widespread criticism in its several years of planning. Local officials and citizens groups in Delanco, Riverton, Pennsauken and other communities along the route have had concerns about safety and property values.</p>
        <p>Unlike a light rail line in Hudson County, where an initial phase linking Bayonne and Jersey City was completed last month, the Trenton-Camden project is not receiving any federal financing, nor did the state ask for it.</p>
        <p>The reason, said Penny Bassett Hackett, a spokeswoman for New Jersey Transit, is that officials did not want to jeopardize financing for the Hudson-Bergen line.</p>
        <p>But a transportation professional who is close to the project said the Trenton-Camden line would not be likely to meet criteria for federal help because of its cost per rider.</p>
