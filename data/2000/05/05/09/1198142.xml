        <p>By all accounts, this year's presidential race is the fairest and most open Mexico has ever seen.</p>
        <p>But consider the fate of a clean-vote television campaign aimed at persuading voters to resist coercive polling tactics, like those that have helped the governing party win every presidential election since the 1920's. Government officials sat passively for weeks as pro-government media executives blocked the commercials from the airwaves.</p>
        <p>That was not the only incident that raised concerns. Foreign election observers, who will be traveling to Mexico to monitor the voting, are facing delays in receiving visas. And lawmakers monitoring campaign finance have been stymied.</p>
        <p>Since this is Mexico's first presidential election in which an opposition candidate, Vicente Fox Quesada, has a credible chance of victory, opposition leaders fear that the long-governing Institutional Revolutionary Party may be quietly sabotaging Mexico's costly, decade-long effort to level its electoral playing field.</p>
        <p>Mexicans are optimistic about the openness of the vote because for the first time an autonomous agency, the Federal Elections Institute, is in charge and is lavishing $918 million on the electoral process to prevent fraud and encourage equitable competition.</p>
        <p>Jose Woldenberg, a former university professor who is president of the electoral institute, makes a concise estimate of the possibility of fraud in this year's ballot counting.</p>
        <p>''Zero,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Woldenberg is especially proud of new voting booths his agency designed for the country's 112,500 polling stations. They are the first Mexican booths to have a curtain so that onlookers cannot watch a voter mark a ballot, he said in an interview. More important, they are the first booths made to fit only one person.</p>
        <p>''A voter who is in that booth will know that even if he was pressured, threatened or regaled with gifts, nobody will know how he voted,'' he said excitedly.</p>
        <p>The new booths are part of sweeping electoral changes. Until 1996, the elections institute was controlled by the Interior Ministry, a political arm of the president, but reforms that year put it under the supervision of a nine-member council representing a range of political groups.</p>
        <p>For this election, the institute has selected 700,000 Mexicans, picked solely because they were born in April, to serve as poll officials. It has also prepared a fast, computerized system for reporting the balloting results, which will be broadcast on live television and posted on the Internet as returns are reported on the night of the vote.</p>
        <p>The 1996 reforms also set limits on private donations and earmarked hundreds of millions of public money to pay for campaigns. The governing party, whose candidate is Francisco Labastida Ochoa, and two opposition coalitions, one backing Mr. Fox and another supporting Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, a leftist former Mexico City mayor, will each receive about $100 million this year for their campaigns.</p>
        <p>The opposition parties, which were nearly shut out of the broadcast media in the last presidential run in 1994, have money to buy a blizzard of advertisements on television and radio, enabling them to reach backlands voters for the first time.</p>
        <p>However, the agency is working to level the electoral playing field in a nation where the governing party, known as the PRI, has held a unique grip on the levers of power for much of a century. It remains the only political group with an organized presence virtually everywhere in the country.</p>
        <p>As a result, old habits die hard. The broadcast media, whose news decisions until the early 1990's were often dictated by the government,  has devoted 37 percent of campaign news coverage to the PRI while Mr. Fox's party has received only 27 percent, according to a survey by the electoral institute.</p>
        <p>Only 32 percent of Mr. Fox's coverage has been positive, compared with 44 percent for Mr. Labastida.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, the election laws still have loopholes. The institute has dozens of auditors to scrutinize the parties' books for violations of campaign finance rules. But by law those auditors will not report their findings until weeks after the election.</p>
        <p>The laws are also vague in regulating efforts by political parties to pressure voters before election day. In Yucatan, the PRI mobilized brigades to go house to house in contested districts making lists of voters' names, according to Patricia McCarthy, a member of the elections council in that state.</p>
        <p>''You can't prove legally that it's coercion,'' Ms. McCarthy said. ''But in practice it is coercion in a state full of very poor people. They say, 'Look out, now the PRI has my name!' ''</p>
        <p>In remote areas of several rural states like Yucatan, the PRI remains  virtually unchallenged.</p>
        <p>In elections in 1997, it was the only party with poll watchers at 3,000 voting places, about 3 percent of the total, and electoral officials said that opposition parties will again have difficulty recruiting poll watchers in many backwoods villages this year.</p>
        <p>President Ernesto Zedillo has by and large stayed above the campaign. But several episodes have raised suspicions among opposition leaders that his government is working to restrain independent election monitoring in order to help the PRI and Mr. Labastida, who was formerly interior minister, Mr. Zedillo's chief political operator.</p>
        <p>The current interior minister, Diodoro Carrasco, said in an interview that his policy was to help the electoral institute to hold fair elections.</p>
        <p>''The majority of Mexicans understand that change has to come by consolidating democracy,'' Mr. Carrasco said.</p>
        <p>But the dispute over the institute's clean-vote television commercials left doubts about his impartiality. One typical advertisement showed menacing individuals intercepting a voter outside a polling place.</p>
        <p>''If you don't vote for him, you'll be sorry,'' one man threatens.</p>
        <p>But the voter smiles as the narrator assures her, ''Your vote is free and secret.''</p>
        <p>The Chamber of the Radio and Television Industry, an association of media barons headed by a longtime PRI member, decreed that because the elections institute was now independent, its advertisements were not eligible for free air time allotted daily to the government. The chamber said it would broadcast the advertisements only if the institute paid for them at steep commercial rates.</p>
        <p>The institute turned to the Interior Ministry for help, but officials there were slow to act on its complaint. After weeks of mounting tension, the broadcast executives agreed at an April 13 meeting, brokered by the Interior Ministry, to begin broadcasting the advertisements immediately, although they will take their fight with the electoral institute to the courts after the July vote.</p>
        <p>Despite the agreement, the blackout continued for almost two weeks. Only in late April did the advertisements begin to appear, after 1,840 spots had already missed their chance to air. Election officials complained they had lost crucial time in their campaign to train poll watchers and prevent vote-buying.</p>
        <p>''It hasn't just been lack of cooperation from the government,'' said Juan Molinar Horcasitas, a member of the elections council. ''It's been lies and obstruction.''</p>
        <p>Another dispute has centered on election observers. In 1994, aggressive government recruiting brought some 1,000 foreigners to Mexico to scrutinize the presidential balloting. This year far fewer are expected, partly because the government has treated prospective observers to warnings, delays and one deportation.</p>
        <p>Ted Lewis, a Mexico specialist at Global Exchange, a San Francisco human rights group, sponsored more than half of the observers accredited so far. But when Mr. Lewis traveled to Guadalajara on April 9 he was detained and sent back to the United States, accused by Interior Ministry officials of circumventing immigration laws by entering Mexico on a tourist visa.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewis said in an interview that he had followed the government's own instructions, which were the same ones he followed without incident in visiting Mexico as an observer during the 1994 and 1997 voting.</p>
        <p>Government officials said this week that they had approved visas for all Global Exchange observers except Mr. Lewis. But by Friday only five had received visas, while the others experienced tedious delays at Mexican consulates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewis and Global Exchange  have clashed with the government in the past over the group's programs to monitor the turmoil in the state of Chiapas.</p>
        <p>Jose Angel Pescador Osuna, the Interior Ministry's top immigration official, said in an interview that he expected hundreds of foreign observers to receive visas eventually. But he added a warning that for this election Mexico planned to enforce vigorously its statutes barring foreigners from taking part in Mexican politics.</p>
        <p>''We are open to observation, but not to scrutiny, judgment or intervention,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Other complaints came from Elodia Gutierrez Estrada, a federal deputy from Mr. Fox's party who heads a congressional subcommittee set up to ensure that no federal money is diverted to the campaigns. She said that President Zedillo refused to meet with the subcommittee and that Interior Ministry officials blocked her efforts to obtain cooperation from other ministries. PRI deputies tried five times to pass motions in the Congress to force the subcommittee to disband before the election.</p>
        <p>''The message has been crystal clear,'' Mrs. Gutierrez said. ''The government and the PRI don't want to accept the democratic progress this subcommittee represents.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Woldenberg is confident the election will be fair.</p>
        <p>''The democratic trend in this country is irreversible,'' he said.</p>
