        <p>Aerin Lauder Zinterhofer left hers in the car. Nicole Miller didn't have time to phone one of her fellow Seventh Avenue designers. But most of the women, and a few of the men, who showed up at the 18th annual Central Park Conservancy lunch last Wednesday had hats on, and you could hear the sound of the air kisses reverberating off the soft wide brims.</p>
        <p>''Mmwhaaa!''</p>
        <p>''Mmwhaaa!''</p>
        <p>No one could get too close to anyone in a hat. That was the hilarious part. A tall, elegantly dressed woman like Fe Fendi, who is married to one of the Fendi heirs and was, naturally, wearing a garden-party Fendi suit of gold-tone raffia and chiffon, would see someone she knew, and right away there would be an elaborate minuet of cocked heads, like two canaries pecking on a branch. But the kisses just kept landing between them.</p>
        <p>''You need an appointment to get under that hat,'' someone said to Michelle Herbert, who had just descended the steps to the Conservatory Garden at Fifth Avenue and 104th Street looking as if she had come from standing on her head in a bowl of buttercups. The brim of her straw hat sloped nearly to the shoulders of her yellow and turquoise suit, which the blond Mrs. Herbert, whose husband's company, Pantone, creates colors for the fashion and decorating trades, wore with turquoise beads.</p>
        <p>''This is the biggest luncheon of the spring season,'' Mrs. Herbert pronounced, without overstating either the conservancy's good deeds or the chance, so vital to the national way of life, to see and be seen. ''Everybody tries to find the perfect hat.''</p>
        <p>Given that the formal custom of wearing hats has been in decline since the Kennedy administration and is now confined mainly to baby christenings and the playing of ''My Old Kentucky Home,'' this could be a foolhardy pursuit. But last week there were actually two occasions in New York where one could wear a hat without feeling like a raving idiot.</p>
        <p>The day after the Central Park lunch, which drew 1,100 people, Joan Rivers, the comedian and celebrity style arbiter, gave a lunch for 40 hatted and coutured women at the Plaza Athenee Hotel on East 64th Street. A number of the women, including Blaine Trump, Princess Firyal of Jordan and Ms. Rivers, were at both affairs. As Ms. Rivers said, explaining the rationale for her part of the doubleheader, whose theme was India, ''We wanted to amortize our hats.''</p>
        <p>While charming, the sight of so many women wandering amid Central Park's tulip displays in cloches, cartwheels and platters, many adorned with flowers or swathed in netting, was hardly the picture to restore one's confidence in hats, let alone in the modern go-getter's ability to wear one without being snickered at.</p>
        <p>''My husband said to me this morning, 'I'll give you any amount of money not to wear that hat,' '' Elizabeth Varet said, casting a look upward at what resembled a small bowl of Chinese noodles with two chopsticks poking out. Ms. Varet smiled. ''I guess he didn't have enough money.''</p>
        <p>A lot of women seemed to be enjoying the attention they were receiving, as if it were a novel experience -- and, in a way, it was. ''I usually just wear hats on the beach,'' said Jill Gilmour, who owns the Wakaya Club on Fiji with her husband, David. They also bottle Fiji Water there. Ms. Gilmour found her black cloche at Chanel.</p>
        <p>''A hat really finishes an outfit,'' said Mrs. Trump, who had on a pastel Michael Kors coat-and-dress ensemble with a wide-brimmed Eric Javits hat blazing with flowers. She even had a pair of white cotton gloves with her. When someone remarked that gloves were certainly out of circulation, Mrs. Trump smiled and said, ''Well, there are a lot of things you don't see anymore.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, so apparently exceptional is the Central Park Conservancy lunch, at least in the minds of hatless New Yorkers, that on Thursday, when Ms. Rivers and her assistants were walking to her hat lunch, she said, a woman stopped them and said, ''You're a day too late.''</p>
        <p>If the gathering in the park was predictably old New York, with women arriving in a pastel haze of fourth-floor designer suits, fancy straw hats and the usual diamonds, Ms. Rivers's party was something else. It was like a scene from a maharani's pleasure palace, with turbaned waiters, a banquet table laden with flowers, including an enormous topiary elephant, and a woman in a sari pressing stick-on caste dots on the foreheads of each arriving guest.</p>
        <p>''Can you believe this?'' said Nan Kempner, under a broad-brim beach hat, as she greeted Mrs. Trump, Jamie Gregory and Lizzie Spender Humphries, whose husband, Barry Humphries, is the performer Dame Edna. The other guests, among them Arlene Dahl, Deborah Norville and Patty Hearst, were already inside the dark bar, trying to make out head from hat. When Mrs. Trump, now wearing a capacious black-and-white hat, remarked that someone had stopped her on the street and asked if she was a member of the British royal family, everyone nodded. Who knew anything anymore?</p>
        <p>''It's so odd to wear a hat in New York,'' said Mrs. Humphries, who looked especially striking, everyone agreed, in a black suit with a domelike hat quivering with feathers. ''My husband wouldn't come to the shop with me, so I took out about five hats on approval to show him. He liked this one.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Rivers came up with the Indian theme months ago and enlisted the help of her friend Anita Johnson and of Preston Bailey, who did the flowers for the wedding of Ms. Rivers's daughter, Melissa. ''Two years ago I did a hat party, as a French garden, but I didn't want to go back to France,'' Ms. Rivers said. ''So I told Preston, 'Let's go to India.' You tell him what you want, and he then flies it to another height. You can say: 'I want trees of life. Wouldn't that be wonderful?' And he says, 'Yes, and I would like to do them with kumquats.' ''</p>
        <p>Ms. Rivers, who returned last month from a trip to India, where she found among other things the orange saris that covered the table, said she had some vague notion of an elephant as a centerpiece, but left the specifics up to Mr. Bailey. ''He said, 'I think it's going to be larger than you expect,' '' she recalled, shrugging. ''I said: 'Well, you know me. More's better.' ''</p>
        <p>The green elephant stood about five feet high, to the tip of its raised trunk. And there were elephants for dessert, too, in the form of white chocolate molds filled with a cardamom-flavored mousse.</p>
        <p>As the hat party broke up, around 3 in the afternoon, Ms. Rivers looked out from under her broad black brim. ''Next year,'' she said, ''we're going to do China.''</p>
