        <p>The Phoenix Suns appear to be in big trouble. Not only do they appear stuck for a successful answer in terms of defending Shaquille O'Neal, but the status of the star guard Jason Kidd is in question.</p>
        <p>Kidd felt soreness in his left ankle during and after the Suns'</p>
        <p>105-77 loss to the Los Angeles Lakers in Sunday's opener of the Western Conference semifinals. He did not practice yesterday and will not again today.</p>
        <p>''I just watched practice and went over the game plan,'' he said yesterday in Phoenix, where the Suns began preparations for Game 2 of the four-of-seven-game series at Staples Center tomorrow night. ''I'll rest for the next couple of days; we'll see how it feels.''</p>
        <p>''If it doesn't feel any better, then I won't go Wednesday. But my plans are to feel good and go out there and win a ballgame.''</p>
        <p>Kidd was generally ineffective in 39 minutes of Game 1, going 1 of 6 from the field in scoring 3 points, and committing 5 of his team's 23 turnovers. He did contribute otherwise with seven rebounds, seven assists and one blocked shot.</p>
        <p>It was only his second game since he broke his ankle March 22. X-rays taken yesterday showed the ankle was not reinjured.</p>
        <p>''The X-rays looked fine,'' Kidd said. ''We iced it. I'm gaining confidence, seeing the bone is completely healed. Off all I've done, the screws haven't moved. I practiced pretty hard those three days before Sunday's game, and maybe I overdid it and the fatigue set in and it just tightened up on me.''</p>
        <p>MALONE'S DAY OF REST: Karl Malone rested his left knee yesterday but expects to play tonight in Portland, Ore., where the Jazz face the Trail Blazers in Game 2 of their second-round series.</p>
        <p>Malone stayed at the team's hotel while the Jazz practiced at Lewis &amp; Clark College. The 36-year-old star forward is listed as probable for Game 2, but the injury should not significantly slow him.</p>
        <p>''We all know Karl will be there,'' guard John Stockton said. ''If his leg's broken, we know he'll be there and play well, and you can't really stop and think about it.''</p>
        <p>Malone strained a ligament in his left knee with three and a half minutes left in the second quarter of Sunday's 94-75 loss to the Blazers. His teammate Armen Gilliam dived for a rebound and tumbled into the chair Malone was sitting on at the end of the bench.</p>
        <p>Malone has missed only six of 1,192 games in his career -- three to suspension. The last time he got hurt was 1989, when he missed two games with a sprained ankle.</p>
