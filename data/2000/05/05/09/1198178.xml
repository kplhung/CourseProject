        <p>The Devils ignored failures of the past in dominating the Toronto Maple Leafs, 3-0, tonight to win their second-round series in six games and reach the Eastern Conference finals for the first time since capturing the Stanley Cup in 1995.</p>
        <p>The last three times the Devils had led a four-of-seven-game series, 3-2, they had lost twice, including last season against the Penguins and in 1994 to the Rangers.</p>
        <p>Judging by the way they Devils played at Continental Arena tonight, they didn't forget those failures. They allowed just six shots on goal -- the fewest allowed in the playoffs or regular season since the league's expansion in 1967 -- and took the lead just 18 seconds into the game.</p>
        <p>With Scott Stevens leading the way, the Devils were more physical and dominated all parts of the ice. His hits on Tomas Kaberle and Kevyn Adams on Saturday night in Toronto most likely reverberated in this encounter, and he delivered two more tonight, on Cory Cross and Tie Domi.</p>
        <p>''As a leader, you have the responsibility to lead by example, and a lot of the guys followed me in this series,'' Stevens said. ''When you give a team just six shots it shows that nobody is dodging anything.''</p>
        <p>It was a quiet game for Devils goalie Martin Brodeur, who stopped three shots in the first period, two in the second and one in the third in earning his second shutout of the playoffs.</p>
        <p>The Maple Leafs failed to convert on their two power plays tonight, leaving them 0 for 20 in the series.</p>
        <p>''I tried not to look at the board,'' Devils Coach Larry Robinson said about the six shots. ''It's like watching water boil. The last time I looked I thought it was 16. Six is something else.''</p>
        <p>With Stevens and the defense setting the tone, Petr Sykora and Jason Arnott scored against Curtis Joseph in the early stages of the first and second periods. John Madden's empty-net goal with six seconds left iced the victory.</p>
        <p>The Devils will face the winner of the Philadelphia-Pittsburgh series, which the Flyers are leading, 3-2. Game 6 is in Pittsburgh Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>Sykora put the Devils on the right track 18 seconds into the game when he dug out the puck in a crowd in front of Joseph for his fourth goal of these playoffs. The goal came after Patrik Elias kicked the puck from behind the goal to the right of Joseph on a play that started with Arnott keeping the puck near Joseph the first time the Devils entered Toronto's zone.</p>
        <p>Arnott scored the Devils' second goal 25 seconds into the second period. This time it was Sykora who made the pass from behind the goal. Arnott, who was in the slot to take the pass, scored his second goal of the playoffs. The sequence started with Ken Daneyko keeping the puck in Toronto's zone.</p>
        <p>The sellout crowd gave Stevens and the Devils, who took 27 shots on goal, a standing ovation midway through the third period when Stevens crushed Domi, Toronto's main policeman, with an open-ice hit midway as he entered the Devils' zone.</p>
        <p>''They finish their checks better than any team in hockey,'' Toronto Coach Pat Quinn said. ''We underestimated the defensive prowess of this hockey club.'' Quinn even gave credit to Stevens, whom he had called a dirty player early in the series, with having ''a big series.''</p>
        <p>With the privilege of making the last change, Robinson maintained the line of Bobby Holik, Sergei Brylin and Randy McKay for almost the entire game. Holik was so effective against Mats Sundin that the Maple Leafs' captain even took a roughing penalty against Holik.</p>
        <p>The defensive pairing against Sundin's line was Stevens and Brian Rafalski. And for the sixth time in the series, they played so well it inspired the rest of the Devils to raise their game.</p>
        <p>It was a night to put past failures to rest. After a team meeting Monday, Daneyko, who has played in all of the Devils' 118 playoff games, recalled the Devils' previous postseason failures. ''You don't forget those things,'' he said.</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>While the Devils used the same lineup as in Game 5, the Maple Leafs used GERALD DIDUCK on defense in place of ALEKSANDR KARPOVTSEV, who missed the last two periods of Game 5 after complaining of an irregular heartbeat after he was hit in the chest with a stick. For the second game in a row, the Maple Leafs also played without WENDEL CLARK, who was nursing a back problem.</p>
