        <p>The funeral fit the man. And of course the city, too. It was majestic, sacramental, solemn, prayerful.  That was uppermost. But it didn't lack a touch of the ticker-tape parade either, and more than a touch of in-your-face political controversy.</p>
        <p>Seldom has so much political, moral and cultural explosiveness been put into such proximity as in the first few pews of St. Patrick's Cathedral yesterday, where President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton knelt with Vice President Al Gore; the Bush dynasty, father and son; Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani; Gov. George E. Pataki; Secretary General Kofi Annan of the United Nations; and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.  There were two former mayors, Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins, and -- well, the idea is clear. Draw all the lines of alliance, rivalry, anger and affection among those individuals and the results would be as messy as a child's scribble.</p>

        <p>Seldom has so much political, moral and cultural explosiveness been put into such proximity as in the first few pews of St. Patrick's Cathedral yesterday, where President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton knelt with Vice President Al Gore; the Bush dynasty, father and son; Mayor Rudolph W.

Dinkins, and -- well, the idea is clear. Draw all the lines of alliance, rivalry, anger and affection among those individuals and the results would be as messy as a child's scribble.</p>
        <p>It was Cardinal John O'Connor, along with the importance of New York City, who brought all those leaders there. One suspects that he would have been delighted and his mischievous sense of humor set working overtime.</p>
        <p>If this was a national event for a national religious leader, it was also an international event for a major figure in an international church.  There were five Roman Catholic cardinals from overseas, as well as the two Americans, Cardinal William Baum and Cardinal Edmund Szoka, who work in Rome. No less than Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Vatican secretary of state, celebrated the Mass. To go any higher it would have had to be the pope himself.</p>
        <p>And it was a personal event, reflecting Cardinal O'Connor himself.  There was his signature emphasis on what the church calls its defense of life, with opposition to abortion and euthanasia at its core, but fleshed out to include international peacemaking; the rights of workers, the poor and the sick; and the condemnation of capital punishment.</p>
        <p>In Cardinal O'Connor's style, Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston was utterly direct with this message -- no matter how uncomfortable he might be making a group of political leaders, virtually none of whom could qualify as ''unambiguously pro-life'' by the standards spelled out in the Boston prelate's homily.</p>
        <p>Very visible at the funeral and frequently mentioned was another of Cardinal O'Connor's typically personal initiatives, the founding of the Sisters of Life, an order of nuns who devote themselves to the cause largely through prayer but also through service to women in need.</p>
        <p>Despite the cardinal's request that the Mass not be a tribute to him, his profile and personality loomed so large as to put all else in the shadows; the other nuns and priests, the lay church workers and active parishioners, the vast New York Catholic Church of parishes and neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>When Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago died in November 1996, his funeral featured gospel music and songs in Polish and Spanish along with polyphony and Gregorian chant. It had brief prayers offered by lay people in many of the archdiocese's languages. The homily was delivered not by a high official but by a local priest who had been the cardinal's longtime aide.</p>
        <p>It was a simple fact of geography, not of anyone's planning, that Cardinal Bernardin was buried with his predecessors in a cemetery 15 miles from his cathedral. The cortege drove through the archdiocese's city streets, far from downtown and past churches and schools and saloons and used-car lots, too, and past clusters of construction workers doffing their hard hats, elderly folks braving the November drizzle and schoolchildren waving signs.</p>
        <p>Cardinal O'Connor, by contrast, was buried within his own cathedral, smack in the middle of Manhattan.  The journey was entirely within the cathedral and surrounded by men in vestments. It was a moving moment when the magnificent choir had completed its Latin chant of ''May the angels escort you into paradise,'' and the worshipers gave the cardinal a final volley of applause before the coffin was carried down to the crypt.</p>
        <p>Some who belong to the New York church of parish bazaars, religious education classes and Altar and Rosary Societies were pressing against the police barriers across Fifth Avenue, but most, one supposed, had to watch on television.</p>
        <p>Yet the funeral did not always seem to float above and beyond this New York church in a realm of Vatican influence, national politics and the New York leader's very special concerns. The service could come suddenly down to earth in the way that Cardinal O'Connor often did, the way so frequently mentioned during the last week, with personal attention to a specific individual.</p>
        <p>When, at the very end of the service, Cardinal William Baum thanked several people who had helped Cardinal O'Connor to the end, he did not stop with family and aides but went on to one of the most faithful but least known of the workers, Maura O'Kelly, who oversaw the cardinal's residence, as she had for his two predecessors. Cardinal O'Connor would have been delighted with that, too.</p>
