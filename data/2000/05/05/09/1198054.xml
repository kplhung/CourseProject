        <p>Forty years ago today, the Food and Drug Administration approved a medication that set off a medical and social revolution.</p>
        <p>The medication was an oral contraceptive called Enovid, introduced in 1960 by Searle to a nation of women increasingly eager for greater certainty in preventing unwanted pregnancies. Though few realized it then, ''the Pill,'' as it came to be called, has turned out to have a number of ancillary health benefits as well as some serious side effects.</p>
        <p>The pill was developed by Dr. Gregory Pincus and Dr. John Rock. Dr. Rock, then a devout Roman Catholic, had hoped in vain that his church would accept it as a ''natural'' means of birth control, although many Catholic women adopted it despite papal proscriptions.</p>
        <p>The pill arrived at a time when abortion was illegal everywhere in the United States and when growing numbers of young women were striving to liberate themselves from the social trappings of premarital chastity and vocational suppression.</p>
        <p>It took just five years for the pill to become the leading reversible contraceptive method in the United States. Since its introduction, an estimated 468 million American women have taken the pill. Today more than 16 million American women are on the pill, making it the most popular contraceptive technique outside of sterilization.</p>
        <p>By blocking ovulation, the synthetic hormones in the birth control pill, when taken properly, proved to be better than 99 percent effective in preventing pregnancy. Only surgical sterilization could match that, and sterilization is not an option for women who may want to have children one day.</p>
        <p>Diaphragms and condoms, which had to be used at the time of intercourse, took their toll on spontaneity and romance and did not offer enough contraceptive security for women seeking to complete their educations and establish careers before starting families.</p>
        <p>For the first time, the pill gave women a highly effective reversible method of contraception that was completely divorced from the sex act.</p>
        <p>But also for the first time, millions of young, healthy women were taking a potent drug every day, raising legitimate concerns about drug-induced health risks of potentially epidemic proportions. All drugs, including those sold over the counter, have side effects.</p>
        <p>And, as predicted, serious, even fatal, complications did occur among users of oral contraceptives, especially among women who smoked or were over 35 and those who used the early high-dose pills.</p>
        <p>These problems prompted a host of warnings and stimulated research that resulted in safer products containing far smaller hormone doses, less than one-hundredth the amount of estrogen in the original pill.</p>
        <p>All the oral contraceptives work by suppressing the pituitary hormones that prompt the ovaries to release eggs ripe for fertilization. Most products contain synthetic versions of both estrogen and progesterone. The so-called minipills contain just synthetic progesterone (progestin). Although the minipill is slightly less effective than the combination pills, it can be used by women, like those who are breast-feeding, who cannot take estrogen.</p>
        <p>In both versions, the hormones are taken daily for 21 days, usually starting from the first day of a woman's menstrual cycle, then stopped to allow the built-up tissue lining the uterus to be shed as menstruation.</p>
        <p>Women can now choose from among 59 different products, all variations on the original theme. The types of synthetic estrogen and progestin, the dosages and the design of dispensing packets vary, and some products include seven dummy pills in addition to the 21 active ones to help women remember to take a pill each day. In 1984 Ortho Pharmaceuticals was the first to introduce a triphasic version of the pill, which provides three different hormone levels in the course of the month, more closely mimicking a woman's natural hormone cycle.</p>
        <p>Health Concerns</p>
        <p>The pill in its current formulations is a remarkably safe drug, and the overwhelming majority of women who take it experience neither minor side effects like breakthrough bleeding or serious health damage. Still, the pill today is sold with an insert mandated by the F.D.A. and filled with more facts, figures and warnings than most women would want to know but should know if they wish to avoid becoming a statistic.</p>
        <p>Blood clots, which can result in heart attacks, strokes, thrombophlebitis, pulmonary embolism or vision-impairing eye damage, are the most common serious side effect and are most likely to occur in women who smoke and in older women. A smoker in her middle to late 20's is seven times as likely to die as a nonsmoker from pill-related clots, and the older the woman, the more smoking increases her risk if she also takes the pill. Women who have already had a clot-related disorder are advised not to take the pill.</p>
        <p>For many years, women over 40 were told to avoid the pill because of clot-associated risks. Then, in 1989 an advisory committee of the F.D.A. noted that if a woman over 40 was healthy and did not smoke, the pill's benefits probably outweighed possible risks, assuming she used the lowest-dose pill that was effective.</p>
        <p>But women who have had cancers of the breast, lining of the uterus (endometrium), cervix or vagina are advised not to take the pill, since it is possible that the hormones it contains could stimulate the growth of such cancers.</p>
        <p>In the late 1960's and mid-70's, two cancer scares temporarily curbed enthusiasm for the pill, but neither scare turned out to have relevance to women using pills then on the market. While there is at present no clear evidence that the pill increases a woman's risk of developing breast cancer, women taking the pill who have strong family histories of breast cancer or those who have had breast nodules or abnormal mammograms should be monitored closely by a doctor.</p>
        <p>Every user of the pill should be told that it does not protect against any sexually transmitted disease, including infection by H.I.V. When there is a risk of such an illness, a condom should also be used in every sexual encounter.</p>
        <p>Surprising Health Benefits</p>
        <p>In addition to avoiding the risks associated with an ill-timed or unwanted pregnancy, the pill has proved to have a number of other benefits. For women whose menstrual cycles are irregular, the pill provides predictability. For those who bleed heavily, it reduces menstrual flow and consequently the risk of becoming anemic. Menstrual cramps and other menstrual symptoms tend to be lessened by the pill and, by minimizing menstrual flow, the pill also diminishes the risk of developing endometriosis and can sometimes reverse this disorder as well.</p>
        <p>The hormones in the pill cause a thickening of the cervical mucus, providing something of a barrier to infectious organisms. As a result, women on the pill have a reduced risk of developing pelvic inflammatory disease, which can damage the tubes and cause infertility.</p>
        <p>The pill also provides some protection against cancers of the endometrium and ovaries. Taking the pill for as little as a year or two significantly diminishes a woman's risk of developing ovarian cancer. Noncancerous breast cysts are less frequent among pill takers. And one product, Ortho Tri-Cyclen, has received F.D.A. approval to treat moderate cystic acne in women 15 or older who desire contraception and who have not been helped by topical acne remedies.</p>
        <p>Although the pill blocks the monthly release of eggs, it does not delay menopause. As Dr. Sharon Winer, an obstetrician-gynecologist and reproductive endocrinologist at the University of Southern California explained, ''A woman's eggs get old and die off even if they are not released, so menopause occurs on schedule.'' But the pill is increasingly being recommended for women approaching menopause whose own estrogen levels are dropping but who still face a risk of becoming pregnant.</p>
        <p>PERSONAL HEALTH  Correction:  May 25, 2000, Thursday  The Personal Health Column on May 9, about the 40th anniversary of the birth control pill, referred incorrectly to the number of women who have taken the pill since its introduction in 1960. The exact number is unknown. Johns Hopkins University has estimated that 80 percent of American women born since 1945 have used oral contraceptives at some time. The erroneous figure, 468 million, applied to the number of women who started taking the pill in any given year plus the number of women who continued to use it from the previous year, for a total of 40 years.</p>
