        <p>IT'S not quite seven weeks since Larry Robinson took command as their coach, but in the Devils' sudden success, it seems like seven years.</p>
        <p>On March 23 the Devils still had the best overall record in the Eastern Conference of the National Hockey League, but they were in a 5-10-2 slump. Lou Lamoriello, their prescient president and general manager, judged that the team had lost what he called its ''ice discipline.'' So he sacked Robbie Ftorek.</p>
        <p>''The way we were playing,'' Lamoriello said at the time, ''I didn't see the light at the end of the tunnel.''</p>
        <p>But with the Devils now halfway through the long, dark Stanley Cup tunnel, Lamoriello can see the light.</p>
        <p>In playing a virtually perfect game last night, the Devils moved into the conference finals with a 3-0 shutout that limited the Toronto Maple Leafs to only six shots on net -- the lowest one-game total in either the regular schedule or the playoffs since the N.H.L. began to keep that statistic in its 1967-1968 expansion season.</p>
        <p>Only six shots on net. That's now the symbol of how Larry Robinson, in his firm and fatherly manner over the last seven weeks, has restored the Devils' ice discipline established by Coach Jacques Lemaire in the 1995 Stanley Cup triumph when Robinson was an assistant coach. And maybe even improved on Lemaire's tactics.</p>
        <p>''Larry keeps reminding us,'' said Scott Stevens, the Devils' captain, ''that once we stop and play a simple game, we're a much better hockey team. He's got our forwards doing a fantastic job of checking. That's how Dallas won the cup last year; their forwards were unbelievable. And that's how we've been able to limit the opposing shots.''</p>
        <p>Ken Daneyko, who has seen eight coaches come and go in his 15 seasons as a Devils defenseman, appreciated the way Robinson simplifies strategy.</p>
        <p>''He's an honest guy, a straight shooter,'' Daneyko said. ''Some coaches go on and on for half an hour with X's and O's, but the players' attention span is never that long. Larry can get it done in three minutes. He's a great translator. He can explain it and simplify it.''</p>
        <p>Daneyko thought Robinson has a toughness he didn't possess in four frustrating seasons as the Los Angeles Kings coach.</p>
        <p>''He gives us a kick in the butt when we need it,'' Daneyko said. ''He did it in the Florida series, and he did it after the opener in Toronto when we thought we had played well even though we didn't win. He reminded us that if we didn't win, we didn't play well enough.''</p>
        <p>During a game, you'll see Robinson talking quietly to a player, sometimes patting a shoulder.</p>
        <p>''Discipline starts behind the bench and Larry is very cool back there,'' Stevens said. ''If you see your coach jumping around, you tend to get excited too. I've always liked a coach who stays calm, who coaches the game and stays off the refs. Larry's calm and he keeps the players the same way.''</p>
        <p>Not long before Ftorek was fired, he was suspended for one game for throwing part of the Devils' bench on the ice to protest a referee's call.</p>
        <p>Robinson is different. When a scrum broke out between goaltender Martin Brodeur and Maple Leaf forward Darcy Tucker as the Devils' 4-3 victory ended Saturday night in Toronto, the Devils coach made sure none of his players on the bench left the bench.</p>
        <p>''I didn't want any of our people being suspended,'' he explained, ''over something silly like that.''</p>
        <p>In 20 solid seasons with the Montreal Canadiens as a Hall of Fame defenseman, Robinson was considered hockey's heavyweight champion when a fight developed, but he was never a goon. He earned six Stanley Cup rings, including four in a row from 1976 to 1979, but for all his glory, he was always humble. And he's humble now.</p>
        <p>''This isn't about me,'' he said. ''It's about those 24 guys that have been here since September. They're the guys out there sweating and bleeding. All I do is point them in the right direction.''</p>
        <p>That direction is toward the other end of the long, dark Stanley Cup tunnel. Only time will tell if the Devils can get through that tunnel to a summer of partying with Lord Stanley's silver chalice, but at least Lou Lamoriello can see the light.</p>
        <p>So can the Devils, and so can their seven-week miracle-worker, Larry Robinson.</p>
