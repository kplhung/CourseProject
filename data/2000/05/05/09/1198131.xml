        <p>A New York City police horse has seen just about everything, right?</p>
        <p>Maybe not a life-size fiberglass cow, painted in fanciful colors.</p>
        <p>So, in preparation for an art exhibition of 500 such cows scattered throughout the five boroughs, bemused mounted officers and their equally bemused horses have some new stablemates these days.</p>
        <p>At a similar exhibition in Chicago last summer, the odd sight spooked some of the horses on Michigan Avenue. To avoid such problems, sample fiberglass cows were sent to New York's mounted police units so the horses could get used to them.</p>
        <p>''These horses are used to seeing all kinds of construction, cement trucks, crowds,'' said Deputy Inspector Peter J. Abbot, the mounted unit commander, at  headquarters on West 42nd Street last week. ''An inanimate cow is not really going to rock their world.''</p>
        <p>Right on cue, a chestnut horse nibbled on the horns of a white, unpainted cow, apparently under the impression it was a large salt lick.</p>
        <p>Downtown at the Troop A stables, next to the First Precinct Headquarters on Varick Street, the steeds were equally blase. At both places, people remarked that the sculptures looked more like bulls than cows, at least in front.</p>
        <p>''That thing has big horns,'' said Arlene Greaves, a hostler at Troop A. ''A female has thin, small horns, little short horns.''</p>
        <p>''And it has a very masculine face,'' she added firmly.</p>
        <p>But Jenny Steinman, an artist who was painting two cows last week in a work space in a former bank building behind Grand Central Terminal, said she had been assured by Mark Varner, a bovine expert at the University of Maryland, that the sculptures were anatomically correct, horn-wise.</p>
        <p>Artists submitted 1,200 possible cow designs. They are paid $2,000 a cow by the corporations, civic groups, cultural institutions and other organizations that are, one might say, ponying up to pay for the exhibition, which opens June 15. Sponsors choose their own designs, so purple cows are not beyond the pale.</p>
        <p>In Chicago, more than 10 million people saw the exhibition, called CowParade, generating more than $500 million in tourist revenue. Of course, Chicago, of stockyards fame, has a long connection with cattle. New York's relationship with cows is more tenuous, particularly since the recent shrinkage of the bull market.</p>
