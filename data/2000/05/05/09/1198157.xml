        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: PROTESTANT OPTIMISM  A key Protestant politician predicted that the Ulster Unionist Party would accept the Irish Republican Army's offer to open its secret arms arsenal to international inspection as a basis for agreeing to re-enter the Northern Ireland home rule government with Sinn Fein, the I.R.A.'s political allies. John Taylor, the unionists' deputy leader, said the I.R.A.'s announcement opened the way for resuming the Belfast government by May 22.</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: MAYOR SWORN IN  Ken Livingstone, the leftist gadfly who won the race for London's first elected mayor despite Prime Minister Tony Blair's efforts to block his candidacy, was sworn into office without ceremony. Mr. Livingstone said he intended to cooperate with the national government but warned that he might go to court to get greater subsidies for the city's beleaguered subway system and block Mr. Blair's plan for its partial privatization.</p>

        <p>NORWAY: STRIKE ENDS  Norwegian employers and unions reached a pay deal for workers in the private sector, ending a crippling six-day strike, said a mediator, Reidar Webster. Union workers were promised pay increases and a fifth week of paid vacation yearly. The compromise ends a strike started last Wednesday by nearly 86,000 workers.</p>

        <p>FRANCE: 2 MORE HELD IN BOMBINGS  Two more suspected Breton separatists are being held for questioning in the bombings of two McDonald's restaurants in Brittany, the police announced, bringing to five the total of suspects in custody. A McDonald's employee was killed in the April 19 bombing. More than 1,000 demonstrators met in Rennes, the leading city in Brittany, to condemn violence as a way to defend the Breton language and culture.</p>

        <p>CHECHNYA: RUSSIAN BOMBER LOST  Russian military officials say a bomber was lost in bad weather over southern Chechnya and may have been shot down. Pro-Chechen Internet sites -- often unreliable -- said the plane was downed by a shoulder-fired antiaircraft missile, and displayed photographs of what was said to be part of an aircraft wing. Russian officials, seeking to shield the crew, refused to say where the plane went down; the Chechens said a hunt for the ''pilot-terrorist'' was under way.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: PALESTINIANS WOUNDED  Israeli troops clashed with Palestinians in the West Bank who were rallying to demand the release of 1,650 prisoners. Israeli soldiers shot and wounded six Palestinians with rubber-coated bullets during clashes with stone-throwers.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: BARAK BACKTRACKS  Prime Minister Ehud Barak angered Palestinians by saying he is likely to delay handing over the three Palestinian villages near Jerusalem he was set to give them as a ''down payment'' on a future territorial transfer. His statements soured negotiations, which will be suspended today and tomorrow for Israeli Memorial Day and Independence Day. Dennis Ross, the American envoy, is returning to Washington with a muted report: much work remains, but he sees ''potential for progress.''</p>

        <p>SUDAN: REBELS QUIT TALKS  The main rebel group suspended its participation in talks aimed at ending a 17-year civil war, to protest what it called reckless bombing of civilian targets by the government. The Sudan People's Liberation Army, fighting for greater autonomy in the south, said the government had attacked several civilian targets in rebel-held areas. The next talks were set to begin May 17.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: CHIAPAS KILLINGS  In a new surge of violence that has claimed 16 lives in Chiapas state since February, three villagers were killed and three wounded by four gunmen in an Indian township. The attack, attributed by officials to a land dispute, came soon after the first visit to the township by Bishop Felipe Arizmendi after he took over the turbulent diocese last week. The township, Chenalho, was the site of the December 1997 massacre of 45 Indians.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: MAYORAL PROTEST  About 150,000 supporters of Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the leading candidate for mayor of Mexico City, rallied to protest efforts by President Ernesto Zedillo's party and two others to use residency rules to exclude Mr. Lopez Obrador from the race. An April poll by the newspaper Reforma showed Mr. Lopez Obrador was 11 percentage points ahead of his nearest rival.</p>

        <p>CANADA: BOUCHARD GAINS  Quebec's premier, Lucien Bouchard, emerged from a convention of his Parti Quebecois with a strengthened mandate as party leader, winning votes from 91 percent of the 2,000 delegates. With a poll last week indicating that only 43 percent of Quebecers want to secede, Mr. Bouchard said he would promote the economic benefits of independence. Mr. Bouchard, whose term expires in 2003, repeated his pledge to hold a vote on independence.</p>

        <p>AFGHANISTAN: TALKS RESUME  Delegations from the Taliban militia and the opposition army of Ahmad Shah Massoud have resumed peace talks in Saudi Arabia. Similar talks in March produced no results. Last year, peace talks preceded a huge Taliban offensive.</p>

        <p>PAKISTAN: SMUGGLING ALERT  Pakistan and Afghanistan have agreed to talks about smuggling, a matter of discord between the two friendly governments. Gen. Pervez Musharraf, Pakistan's military leader, has vowed to stop the trucks and busloads of smuggled goods that enter Pakistan each day.</p>
