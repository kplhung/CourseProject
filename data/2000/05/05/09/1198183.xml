        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A parent who needs to get services for an autistic child faces a race against time (front page, May 6).  Without these services in early childhood, the window of opportunity is lost to make real changes and improvements in the child's developmental deficits. For a parent there is no time to ponder what and how to do it. It must simply be done.</p>

        <p>A parent who needs to get services for an autistic child faces a race against time (front page, May 6).  Without these services in early childhood, the window of opportunity is lost to make real changes and improvements in the child's developmental deficits.

        <p>My son developed normally until he was a year old, and then he went into a tailspin. He lost the ability to speak and would retreat to a corner and bang his head against a wall.</p>
        <p>I could no longer work. After much struggle I was able to enroll him in a state-financed private school. At that point I was financially ravaged and was living under a kind of stress and fear that only other parents with an autistic child can recognize. But I was lucky to be able to get my son a place at that school because it saved his life.</p>
