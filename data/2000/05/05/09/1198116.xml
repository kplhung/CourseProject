        <p>What's going on with the American labor movement?</p>
        <p>In March the Teamsters started lobbying the Clinton White House to award one of the Teamsters' largest employers, UPS, a much sought after new air route for landing cargo planes in China. At the same time, the Teamsters have been lobbying against the administration's effort to grant China permanent normal trade relations or entry into the World Trade Organization, which would actually spur U.S.-China cargo trade. ''It seems that the Teamsters want us to have more cargo flights to China, but no cargo,'' said one U.S. official. They want more trade in empty boxes.</p>

        <p>What's going on with the American labor movement?</p>
        <p>In March the Teamsters started lobbying the Clinton White House to award one of the Teamsters' largest employers, UPS, a much sought after new air route for landing cargo planes in China. At the same time, the Teamsters have been lobbying against the administration's effort to grant China permanent normal trade relations or entry into the World Trade Organization, which would actually spur U.S.-China cargo trade. ''It seems that the Teamsters want us to have more cargo flights to China, but no cargo,'' said one U.S. official. They want more trade in empty boxes.</p>
        <p>This is almost as interesting as the dockworkers' union marching in Seattle against more globalization and free trade, which is like the milkmen's union coming out against cows. No trade, no dockworkers. No milk, no milkmen. But then you also have the United Auto Workers opposing the trade deal with China, which is strange since today virtually no U.S.-made car can be sold in China, but under the Clinton-negotiated W.T.O. deal all U.S.-made cars can be sold, financed and distributed in China.</p>
        <p>And then, of course, there was the lovely scene during the recent anti-I.M.F. protests in Washington when that hate-mongering isolationist Pat Buchanan joined forces with the Teamsters and their boss James Hoffa. Mr. Buchanan told cheering Teamsters that as president he would tell the Chinese to either shape up or ''you guys have sold your last pair of chopsticks in any mall in the United States,'' and that he would appoint Mr. Hoffa as America's top trade negotiator.</p>
        <p>How did the U.S. labor movement go from being a progressive force to being the leading opponent of free trade and pal of Pat Buchanan? I posed that question to the former Labor Secretary Robert Reich, now a Brandeis University professor.</p>
        <p>His short answer is that U.S. labor unions have come to totally distrust U.S. business, and are convinced that free trade is simply a vehicle for moving manufacturing jobs abroad.</p>
        <p>''I believe the labor leaders today are being pushed by their rank and file, who never liked Nafta and who do not trust American business to keep jobs in this country,'' said Mr. Reich. ''Even though the business cycle in recent years has improved things for the country as a whole, labor does not feel that it has really shared fully in the expansion. It feels that manufacturing jobs are still vanishing -- whether because of technology or globalization and free trade.''</p>
        <p>Labor's response, therefore, has been to try to slam America's doors shut, even though it is obvious that globalization and free trade have contributed mightily to America's economic expansion. What to do? Congressman Sander Levin's thoughtful proposal for better monitoring of China's worker and human rights behavior is laudable, but I don't think labor really cares about either.</p>
        <p>What we need is a business-government-labor summit that tries to defuse at least some of labor's real concerns in return for a tempering of its opposition to trade.</p>
        <p>''If the business community is really serious,'' says Mr. Reich, ''it should combine the China trade deal with legislation that would give labor a ban on the permanent replacement of striking workers, something labor has sought for years, and it would also treble the fines against any company that illegally fires workers for trying to form unions. In recent years more companies have been using the threat of permanently replacing striking workers, and the practice of illegally firing workers for trying to form unions has been on the rise, because the penalty structure is just a slap on the wrist.''</p>
        <p>This is worth considering. Free trade and the new economy have been very good for the U.S., but the gains have been unequally distributed, particularly when it comes to blue-collar workers. My attitude toward labor is: Tell us what we can do to ameliorate that -- short of putting up walls and closing doors that will only hurt us all in the long run. Sure, we could redistribute income through tax policy, but that isn't going to happen. So why not try Mr. Reich's idea: Strengthen workers' ability to negotiate wages, severance and security on their own behalf within the new economy.</p>
        <p>Pie-in-the-sky? Maybe. But some way has to be found to persuade labor to loosen its grip on the door, and one way could be this bargain: You let go of the door and we'll empower you to better thrive with it open.</p>
