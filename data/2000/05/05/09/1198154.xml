        <p>An effort by the National Park Service to set a controlled fire in a densely wooded area of New Mexico has blown out of control, forcing the evacuation of thousands of people and threatening the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where some of the country's most sensitive nuclear weapons research is conducted.</p>
        <p>The Los Alamos fire started Thursday, when the park service began burning thick stands of ponderosa pines and conifers that had accumulated in the Bandelier National Monument after years of suppressing natural fires. But the efforts, for which officials had extensively planned, quickly went awry when fierce winds, gusting up to 45 miles an hour, suddenly blew the blaze beyond the fire breaks that had been prepared and blackened hundreds of acres throughout the weekend.</p>

        <p>An effort by the National Park Service to set a controlled fire in a densely wooded area of New Mexico has blown out of control, forcing the evacuation of thousands of people and threatening the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where some of the country's most sensitive nuclear weapons research is conducted.</p>
        <p>The Los Alamos fire started Thursday, when the park service began burning thick stands of ponderosa pines and conifers that had accumulated in the Bandelier National Monument after years of suppressing natural fires. But the efforts, for which officials had extensively planned, quickly went awry when fierce winds, gusting up to 45 miles an hour, suddenly blew the blaze beyond the fire breaks that had been prepared and blackened hundreds of acres throughout the weekend.</p>
        <p>Kevin Roark, a spokesman for the nuclear laboratory, said the fire had reached the western edge of the laboratory site, which covers 42 square miles. He said the laboratory had been closed, with about 500 emergency personnel on duty and the other 10,000 or so employees sent home.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roark said the fire was threatening bunkers where high explosives were stored. The bunkers, made of hardened concrete and earth, survived a fire in 1977, so the laboratory was fairly confident there would be no problems this time. He added that nuclear materials, like the plutonium used in bombs, were stored in separate sites that are not near the fire.</p>
        <p>Steve Coburn, the fire marshal with the Los Alamos County Fire Department, said that roughly 2,000 acres had burned and that about 500 households south of the city, near Los Alamos Canyon, had been evacuated. Many more people had voluntarily left the area. He said the city looked like a ghost town, with the air thick with heavy, dark smoke and ash swirling in the stiff winds.</p>
        <p>Forest service officials said the fire might be contained in a few days, at best, if the winds died down.</p>
        <p>''The conditions were in the acceptable limits when they began the burn, but the winds this time of year are very unpredictable,'' Mr. Coburn said. He said there had been no injuries and no homes destroyed, but the fire was within several hundred yards of a residential area.</p>
        <p>Another fire, near the southern resort town of Ruidoso, burned 5.400 acres and forced the evacuation of more than 200 homes today, The Associated Press reported. That fire, mostly on the Lincoln National Forest, started Sunday and has destroyed a mobile home and two homes under construction. Two firefighters suffered minor injuries.</p>
