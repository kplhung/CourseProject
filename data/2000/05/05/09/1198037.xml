      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Within the constellation Andromeda is a dull, fuzzy patch of light.</p>
        <p>This is the Great Andromeda galaxy, spiral in shape and similar to Earth's own Milky Way galaxy, at 14 billion billion miles, the farthest object one can see with the naked eye.</p>
        <p>It is getting closer.</p>
        <p>Like the headlight of a distant, oncoming car, this little patch of light will slowly brighten and sharpen over the eons. Andromeda and the Milky Way are speeding toward each other at more than 250,000 miles per hour. In three billion years, the two galaxies may slam together head-on.</p>
        <p>Astronomers have known for decades that Andromeda is headed this way, though they still cannot say whether the two are destined to collide or merely to speed past, narrowly missing each other.</p>
        <p>But, if their paths are to cross, computer simulations now provide a preview of that celestial crash.</p>
        <p>Using the latest, biggest, fastest computer at the San Diego Supercomputer Center, Dr. Lars E. Hernquist, a professor of astronomy at Harvard University, and Dr. John J. Dubinski, an assistant professor of astronomy at the University of Toronto, calculated the motions of 107 million particles representing the contents of the two galaxies to obtain the most detailed look yet at their future.</p>
        <p>''We took a collision where it's mostly head-on, but it's slightly offset,'' Dr. Hernquist said.</p>
        <p>Given that outer space is mostly empty, individual stars would very rarely, if ever, run into one another, the astronomers say, and the hundreds of billions of stars in the two galaxies would continue to burn, unaffected by the merger.</p>
        <p>But gravitational forces would radically shuffle around the stars' locations.</p>
        <p>As the two initially graze past each other, the gravitational forces pull off strands of stars into ''tidal tails,'' ripping apart the galaxies' pinwheel shapes and casting tens of billions of stars into the dark, intergalactic void.</p>
        <p>About two billion years later, the Andromeda and the Milky Way merge into one larger, mangled blob.</p>
        <p>''It wouldn't look like a spiral galaxy anymore,'' Dr. Hernquist said.</p>
        <p>While supercomputers are needed for the details, the basic physics of how tidal tails form is simple.</p>
        <p>''The essence of the phenomenon is almost kinematic,'' said Dr. Alar Toomre, professor of applied mathematics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</p>
        <p>Even ''clumsy calculations'' he performed in the 1970's produced tidal tails, he said.</p>
        <p>Just as the gravitational pull of the Moon creates tides in Earth's oceans, the pull of one galaxy on the other would lead to bulges of stars on the near and the far sides of each galaxy.</p>
        <p>Because the galaxy rotates, ''the far side gets swung and slung into something that looks like a comma,'' Dr. Toomre said. ''This comma, after a while, goes flying off into space,'' producing the tail, he added.</p>
        <p>The detailed simulations could help astronomers figure out whether the football-shape elliptical galaxies they observe are the result of spiral galaxies that have collided and combined. Some elliptical galaxies have streams of stars orbiting around them.</p>
        <p>''That might suggest perhaps these elliptical galaxies are a more evolved version of what we're seeing at the end of the simulation,'' Dr. Hernquist said.</p>
        <p>The simulations could also lead to better understandings of the halos of ''dark matter'' that encircle the visible parts of the galaxies.</p>
        <p>For anyone left on Earth three billion years from now, the night sky would become almost totally black if the Sun were one of the stars cast out into the void.</p>
        <p>''You would have this dark sky with very few stars,'' Dr. Dubinski said. ''Maybe none.''</p>
        <p>If the Sun and Earth were pushed in the other direction, toward the center of the merging pair, the view would brighten considerably. When galaxies collide, hydrogen gas left over from the formation of the galaxies is sometimes pushed toward the center, sparking a new epoch of star-making.</p>
        <p>''When you slam that much gas together, you can ignite these starbursts,'' Dr. Dubinski said. With more stars, there would be more supernovas, the explosive deaths of the largest stars.</p>
        <p>''There are these celestial fireworks that will be going off for tens of millions of years,'' Dr. Dubinski said. ''It would be much brighter than a full Moon.''</p>
        <p>A supernova too close, however, could kill off any remaining life on Earth, though the end of the world would be nearing in any case. By the time the two galaxies complete their merger about five billion years from now, the Sun will have burned out.</p>
