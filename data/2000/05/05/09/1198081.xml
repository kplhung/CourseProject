        <p>The police fired rubber bullets and tear gas today to break up a demonstration by students protesting a 17-year-old novel they said insulted Islam.</p>
        <p>At the height of the protest this morning at Al Azhar University, the most prestigious Islamic educational institution in the Middle East, about 2,000 students hurled rocks and insults at the police and chanted ''God is great!'' and ''Back to Islam!''</p>
        <p>After several hours of intermittent clashes, the police were able to drive the few hundred remaining protesters into a dormitory and disperse the rest late in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>It was the first open violence between government forces and Muslim fundamentalists in several years. An Islamic insurgency against the secular Egyptian government in the early 1990's has largely been subdued and a government crackdown has put thousands of suspected militants into prison.</p>
        <p>Security officials said they had arrested some student protesters, although the Ministry of Interior refused to say how many. At the scene, students and a hospital security guard said at least eight people had been injured by police fire and dozens were being treated after being overcome by the tear gas, although there was no independent confirmation of that.</p>
        <p>The book that provoked the demonstration, ''Banquet of Seaweed,'' was written by Haider Haider, a Syrian, and first published in Cyprus in 1983. The novel then came out in Lebanon in 1992 and in Syria in 1993. Last November, Egypt's Ministry of Culture reprinted it in connection with a project to promote major works of modern Arabic literature.</p>
        <p>The book drew little public notice until last week, when a Cairo newspaper long associated with the Islamic fundamentalist movement, El-Shaab, published what it said were excerpts from Mr. Haider's novel that insulted the prophet Muhammad and Islam.</p>
        <p>Several students interviewed at the demonstrations said they had not read the book -- Egyptian officials have said they recalled all copies once the controversy over the book erupted last week -- and knew about it only from the El-Shaab articles.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview from his home in Latakia, Syria, Mr. Haider, 64, denounced the campaign against his novel as ''ignorant'' and said that lines from the book were taken out of context by ''Islamic hard-liners.''</p>
        <p>''They are launching an attack against enlightenment,'' he said. ''They are fighting to take us back to the age of darkness and ignorance.''</p>
        <p>Opposition journalists and politicians have called for the resignation of Egypt's minister of culture, Farouk Hosni, over the last few months over a number of issues, including his proposal to build a new museum for Egyptian antiquities in Cairo.</p>
