        <p>A 2-year-old girl who managed to squeeze through a flexible panel next to an air-conditioning unit fell nine stories from a window in a Harlem apartment building yesterday and was critically hurt, the police said.</p>
        <p>They said the toddler, Krishawna Swinson, fell about 100 feet from a window in her family's apartment at the Abraham Lincoln Houses at 2140 Madison Avenue and East 132nd Street and landed in a fenced-in lot about 1:05 p.m. Krishawna suffered multiple fractures and was in critical condition yesterday at Harlem Hospital Center, the authorities said.</p>

        <p>A 2-year-old girl who managed to squeeze through a flexible panel next to an air-conditioning unit fell nine stories from a window in a Harlem apartment building yesterday and was critically hurt, the police said.</p>
        <p>They said the toddler, Krishawna Swinson, fell about 100 feet from a window in her family's apartment at the Abraham Lincoln Houses at 2140 Madison Avenue and East 132nd Street and landed in a fenced-in lot about 1:05 p.m. Krishawna suffered multiple fractures and was in critical condition yesterday at Harlem Hospital Center, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>Marjorie Brown, 75, who lives in a ground-floor apartment with a window facing the lot, said she heard a thump on the grass when the child struck. ''I heard it, but I didn't pay it no mind,'' Ms. Brown said. ''They're forever throwing things out the windows.''</p>
        <p>A few minutes later, however, Ms. Brown said, she heard voices.  Looking outside, she saw police officers trying to revive the toddler. A small baby bottle with a red nipple was lying in the dirt nearby.</p>
        <p>''I heard the police saying, 'Come on, come on, you can make it, breathe,' '' she said.</p>
        <p>Sgt. Brian Burke, a police spokesman, said Krishawna was being watched by her grandmother, Sheila Swinson, 37, in the family's four-room apartment.</p>
        <p>Ms. Swinson was in another room when the child managed to push aside the panel beside the air-conditioner and shinny through the small open space.</p>
        <p>Three other children were in the apartment at the time. The authorities said there were no signs of foul play. ''It appears at this time that it was an accident,'' Sergeant Burke said.</p>
        <p>Krishawna was conscious when she arrived at the emergency room at the hospital, officials said.</p>
        <p>''Her eyes were open and she was watching what was going on,'' said Renelda Walker, a hospital spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>Howard Marder, a spokesman for the Housing Authority, said the window was not required to have a child-safety guard because the authority had granted the Swinsons a waiver last year allowing an air-conditioner there.</p>
