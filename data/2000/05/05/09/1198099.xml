        <p>Having been burned in recent weeks by the dot-coms, Wall Street insiders are turning an increasingly bullish eye to a new, white-hot market sector: the dot-orgs.</p>
        <p>At first blush, Wall Street's mad rush to invest in nonprofit organizations seems counterintuitive, but market gurus believe that the dot-orgs provide something the dot-coms cannot: predictability.</p>
        <p>''The dot-com companies promise huge profits but wind up hemorrhaging cash,'' said Ivan Z., a senior dot-org analyst. ''The nonprofit organizations promise no profits and consistently deliver on that promise.''</p>
        <p>He added that, unlike the dot-coms, dot-orgs are not the subject of nagging questions about earnings. ''If people ask when the dot-orgs will turn a profit, there's a simple answer: 'When pigs fly.' Going forward, we expect the dot-orgs to rack up an impressive string of zeroes for some time to come.''</p>
        <p>In a surprising chorus of unanimity, Main Street seems to be agreeing with Wall Street, as investors rush to gobble up the suddenly sexy dot-orgs.</p>
        <p>Buster H., a full-time day trader,  has dumped his shares of priceline.com and is loading up on stocks like audubon.org and sierraclub.org. ''With dot-coms, I used to lose sleep worrying about bad earnings reports,'' he told a reporter at the Dot-Org Market Site in Times Square, where investors huddled to track the performance of today's hot I.P.O., savethewhales.org.</p>
        <p>''Dot-orgs may earn nothing, but when you've lost as much money as I have, nothing starts to look like something.''</p>
        <p>While some naysayers warn of a coming dot-org bubble, Ivan Z. shrugs off this doom-and-gloom scenario. ''I've put out a strong buy rating on both pbs.org and npr.org,'' he said. ''These two are a sure bet never to turn a profit, plus, you get a mug.''</p>
