        <p>It only took one game for Jeff Van Gundy to go from the genius who produced the blueprint to stop Vince Carter to the second-guessed coach who left Marcus Camby on the bench at the end of Sunday's Game 1 loss in Miami.</p>
        <p>''Again, Marcus, I thought, played very well,'' Van Gundy said today, put in a position to defend himself after Camby had 11 points and 13 rebounds but did not play the last four minutes of the game. ''But I really do believe we went down the stretch in those three games against Toronto the same way and got the same shots.''</p>
        <p>This time, Larry Johnson did not hit the open 3-pointer to win the game. On Sunday, with 1 minute 11 seconds remaining, Johnson was left open but rushed his shot and left it well off the side of the rim. If he had made the 3-pointer, the Knicks would have had a 1-point lead and the outcome might have been different.</p>
        <p>''I'm upset every time something doesn't work, and it didn't work,'' Van Gundy said. ''So believe me, you guys aren't the first to evaluate me. I do it for myself. When it doesn't work, you made the wrong decision as a coach.</p>
        <p>''It's not about Marcus being on a roll. I thought that was our best unit to finish with in Game 1. I thought Marcus played well. I thought Larry played well.''</p>
        <p>Some players, like Latrell Sprewell, wondered about Van Gundy's strategy, too.</p>
        <p>''When Marcus is playing like that, he definitely needs to play, but it's up to Jeff to decide that, though,'' said Sprewell, who noted that he talked to Camby after the game and found his teammate discouraged. ''We talked. But Marcus isn't the type, at this point, to pout or anything like that. We're all about winning.</p>
        <p>''I think he just understands that Jeff wants him to come off the bench. Obviously, I think Marcus probably would rather start. And like I've said, we all want to play as many minutes as possible. But we have so much talent, that's a difficult thing for Jeff to go back and forth with. I think Marcus understands that.''</p>
        <p>Publicly, Camby was very accepting of his role in Game 1. He didn't complain or question his coach.</p>
        <p>''I just play in the concept of the team and within my game,'' he said. ''If it is coming out in the last five minutes, so be it. The guys who are out there on the court are definitely money players. Larry is a proven big-time player, as we saw last series.''</p>
        <p>Against Toronto, an open 3-pointer for Johnson sealed Van Gundy from the second-guessing.</p>
        <p>''If that ball swings to Larry and he makes it, everyone is talking about something else today,'' Van Gundy said. ''People want to make it out to be a complicated issue. But if you make your shots, like we did in Toronto, it covers up the mistakes. If you miss down the stretch, they aren't covered up as much.''</p>
        <p>Riley's Move Pays Off</p>
        <p>Latrell Sprewell suspects that Coach Pat Riley focused on the way Toronto limited his offensive impact in Game 3 of the Knicks' first-round series. For the first time since Sprewell has been a Knick, Riley doubled Sprewell on the pick-and-roll and also in the post.</p>
        <p>''It's very similar to Game 3 in Toronto,'' Sprewell said. ''I think Riles saw that, and decided they could do that, too.''</p>
        <p>Against that strategy in Toronto, Sprewell scored 11 points. On Sunday, he also scored 11 points. Unlike the Raptors series, though, Sprewell did not make Miami pay by finding the cutter or the open man with passes. In Game 1 against Miami, he had one assist.</p>
        <p>''The Heat surround you with guys who have long arms and size, so I can't see the cutters as well,'' Sprewell said. ''I'll have to adjust.''</p>
