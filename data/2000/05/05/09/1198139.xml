        <p>For five years, Mike Emrick enriched Fox's coverage of the National Hockey League. But for its N.H.L. games this season, and the next four, ABC chose to use ESPN's voices, and not to employ Emrick.</p>
        <p>Leaving Emrick out was expected because of the ABC-ESPN corporate connection. But not having Emrick means that ABC's No. 1 hockey voice is not the absolute best.</p>
        <p>Emrick's skills remain on display during Devils games on Fox Sports New York. His play-by-play is smooth, clear, linguistically absorbing and as grammatically sharp as it is possible to be at hockey's pace.</p>
        <p>In one 22-second sound bite late in Game 5 of the Devils-Toronto playoff series Saturday night, Emrick showed his vocal dexterity. With the Devils leading, 3-2, with 6 minutes 15 seconds left in the game, Emrick said:</p>
        <p>''Here's a shot fought off by Niedermayer. Niedermayer hugs the boards. It's Thomas. The pass behind is cut off by Stevens and dumped along for Claude Lemieux. Shoots it along. Kaberle tried to play it further. Niedermayer's stick knocked out of his hand, so it's shillelaghed back out again by Stevens. Brought on by Pandolfo. To Madden. Madden, cruising in, fires! Score!''</p>
        <p>Emrick calls radio on TV, and unintrusive camera work is the best way to illustrate that. In a telecast with action as ferocious as Saturday's was in its final minutes, the FSNY director Joe O'Rourke rarely strayed from the game camera mounted high at center ice.</p>
        <p>To bring viewers closer to the game, it has become fashionable in live hockey for directors to jump to close-ups, low-angle corner shots or the cameras from above the goals. Each option holds potential rewards to jazz up the telecast but risks losing sight of the puck, a developing three-on-two rush or linear perspective.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes, if I feel I'm winning the gambles, I do it, but if I'm losing, I back off,'' O'Rourke said.</p>
        <p>But when the right conservative direction was needed, Emrick's words found almost perfect accompaniment. Four quick cuts were made from four minutes left in the third period until 2:50 remained. From that point until 17 seconds were left -- a patch with relentless action and no stoppages -- FSNY never shifted live from the center-ice roost.</p>
        <p>''The game dictated that,'' O'Rourke said. ''When it's flying like that, all you can do is make people mad by cutting away. I couldn't see the sense in guessing where to go.''</p>
        <p>Last Monday, however, FSNY's center-ice perch at Continental Arena seemed like the worst way to watch the Devils-Toronto series. ESPN, CBC, the Canadian network, and SRC, the French-language broadcaster, got preferred space in the traditional center-ice position on the arena's first tier, pushing FSNY up a level, which brought vertigo to hockey viewing. By the next game in New Jersey, two nights later, FSNY had reclaimed a lower position.</p>
        <p>Missed Shots, Cheap Shots</p>
        <p>The last few minutes of Game 1 of the Knicks-Miami National Basketball Association playoff series on Sunday on NBC offered less verbal clarity than FSNY provided during the Devils-Maple Leafs game.</p>
        <p>You had to wonder what Bill Walton, an NBC analyst, meant in labeling Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy a prophet for saying the series would come down to ''one play, one shot, one tipped ball, a long 3 or an offensive rebound.'' Not many options left, are there? You, too, can be a seer if you foresee every possibility but an 84-foot shot.</p>
        <p>Walton and Steve Jones, the co-analyst, also provided a safe haven for Allan Houston, who too often evades criticism for his ballhandling.</p>
        <p>Jones praised Houston for ''playing with control'' after hitting the second of two jumpers, which put the Knicks ahead, 81-79. But neither announcer said a word -- not even a ''horrible'' from Walton -- when Houston made two turnovers, one on an ill-advised pass to Patrick Ewing.</p>
        <p>Although Walton criticized Chris Childs for flinging 3-point shots when he should have been setting up Houston, Larry Johnson or Latrell Sprewell, he seemed not to care enough to comment when Childs faked a 3-pointer, then traveled.</p>
        <p>Yet the NBC announcers found it easier to criticize questionable 3-point shots missed by Miami's Tim Hardaway, who is hampered by an ankle injury. After the first of the shots, an air ball, Tom Hammond, the play-by-play announcer asked,  ''What in the world was that about?''</p>
        <p>Airwaves</p>
        <p>Bob Sheppard's stint in Channel 5's Yankee booth, after being honored Sunday for 50 seasons as the Yankees' public-address announcer, was noteworthy for hearing him playfully acting as the guest analyst, and doing badly at it, and for calling Tim McCarver ''Timothy.'' . . . The newly retired Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino will be named the newest analyst for HBO's ''Inside the N.F.L.'' today. . . . Jim Courier will be a Wimbledon analyst for TNT and CNN/SI.</p>
        <p>NBC's N.B.A. ratings fell this past weekend, but not as steeply as last week's. Saturday's game between Indiana and Philadelphia produced a 4.0 overnight Nielsen rating, down 23 percent from the comparable day last year. Sunday's tripleheader rated an average 6.7, down 6 percent from last year. Game 1 of the Knicks-Miami series rated a 6.0, down from a 6.1 for the comparable time slot last year. . . . TNT and TBS's basketball ratings are up 9 percent to a 2.4. . . . ABC's final Kentucky Derby -- NBC takes over next year -- produced a 6.6 rating, the same as 1999.</p>
        <p>HBO's film about Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris during the 1961 season, which starts production next month, will augment Tiger Stadium with special effects and construction to recreate old Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>TV SPORTS  Correction:  May 10, 2000, Wednesday  The TV Sports column yesterday, about the hockey announcer Mike Emrick, referred incorrectly to his experience this year with ABC Sports. While he has broadcast none of the network's National Hockey League playoff games, he was indeed employed for four regular-season games.</p>
