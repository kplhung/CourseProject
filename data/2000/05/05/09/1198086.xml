        <p>Turkey, the site of numerous ancient Greek and Roman cities, can boast of antiquities that are among the finest and most abundant in the world. But now Turkey is mocking its rich cultural inheritance by heedlessly flooding what may be one of the world's richest collections of Roman mosaics before the world has a chance to see them.</p>
        <p>In the last few months, archaeologists have been urgently excavating the ruins of an ancient city that flourished in southern Turkey 2,000 years ago, against the day only weeks from now when it will be inundated by the rising waters created by a dam project. The ancient city, Zeugma, was a base for the Roman Legion at the eastern edge of the Roman Empire. It was a thriving center for the Silk Road trade on the banks of the Euphrates River, comparable in size and wealth to Pompeii. Rich traders decorated the floors of their villas with exquisite mosaics depicting scenes of Greek mythology. The city is believed to have succumbed to invasion, fire and an earthquake in the third century A.D., and has been covered by layers of dirt and rubble ever since.</p>

        <p>Turkey, the site of numerous ancient Greek and Roman cities, can boast of antiquities that are among the finest and most abundant in the world. But now Turkey is mocking its rich cultural inheritance by heedlessly flooding what may be one of the world's richest collections of Roman mosaics before the world has a chance to see them.</p>
        <p>In the last few months, archaeologists have been urgently excavating the ruins of an ancient city that flourished in southern Turkey 2,000 years ago, against the day only weeks from now when it will be inundated by the rising waters created by a dam project. The ancient city, Zeugma, was a base for the Roman Legion at the eastern edge of the Roman Empire. It was a thriving center for the Silk Road trade on the banks of the Euphrates River, comparable in size and wealth to Pompeii. Rich traders decorated the floors of their villas with exquisite mosaics depicting scenes of Greek mythology. The city is believed to have succumbed to invasion, fire and an earthquake in the third century A.D., and has been covered by layers of dirt and rubble ever since.</p>
        <p>Archaeologists began concentrated excavation this past winter, after belatedly discovering that it was an important site that was soon to disappear under water. The dam that threatens the site is part of an ambitious multibillion-dollar economic development plan. Most of its gates were closed only at the end of last month to begin creating a large artificial lake to be used for power generation.</p>
        <p>No one disputes Turkey's need for electricity. But surely a way can be found to postpone the destruction of an invaluable archaeological find. Archaeologists working at the site have said that in four months they can collect and preserve mosaics comparable to the region's finest, while in two years they could surpass even the world's greatest collection, in Tunis. These are not onerous delays for a long-term energy project.</p>
        <p>In recent years Turkey has objected to the plundering of its antiquities by thieves and foreigners, launching an aggressive campaign to repatriate artifacts that it says were taken out of the country illegally. In 1993 New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art agreed to return the so-called Lydian Hoard, a cache of some 200 treasures dating to the sixth century B.C. that had been removed from Turkey in the early 1960's.</p>
        <p>Countries like Turkey have a legitimate interest in seeking to reclaim their cultural patrimony, but they also have an obligation to protect that patrimony. In this case Turkey is betraying its own history by allowing a site of priceless value to be destroyed.  Cultural institutions around the world may doubt  Turkey's claim to value its cultural inheritance if it sacrifices so rich a treasure. It is not too late for Turkey to work with archaeologists to find a realistic timetable that will save these treasures from extinction.</p>
