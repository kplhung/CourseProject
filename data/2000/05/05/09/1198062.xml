        <p>Washington is the odd arena for a $100 million libel trial in which two car dealers from Northern Ireland are challenging a small Colorado publisher and an author who accused them of participation in a secret ruling committee of Protestant terrorists.</p>
        <p>At the center of the dispute is Sean McPhilemy's book ''Committee: Political Assassination in Northern Ireland,'' published in 1998 by Roberts Rinehart. British publishers, who operate under much tougher libel laws than those in the United States, declined to issue the book.</p>
        <p>''The Committee'' grew out of a 1991 British documentary produced by Mr. McPhilemy, who says that an influential group of about 60 middle-class Protestant business professionals in County Armagh forged links in the 1980's with British special police forces and Unionist paramilitary group, bankrolling a terrorist campaign that led to nearly 60 killings of Roman Catholics.</p>
        <p>The brothers David and Albert Wesley Prentice are among the businessmen cited by Mr. McPhilemy.  They are pressing their libel claim against Mr. McPhilemy and Roberts Rinehart, a press near Boulder that says it has stopped publishing new books partly because of trouble obtaining loans with a lawsuit clouding its future.</p>
        <p>The suit was filed in Washington because Mr. McPhilemy heavily promoted the book there, said William W. Taylor, the attorney for the businessmen.</p>
        <p>The Prentice brothers and their relatives are expected to testify. So is Mr. McPhilemy, who lives in England, and Frederick R. Rinehart, a founder of the press and the scion of an old-line New York publishing family that once was part of Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston.</p>
        <p>Jury selection is expected to start today in the trial, which is being heard by Washington Superior Court Judge Geoffrey Alprin. The witness lists for both sides indicate that the jury may soon be presented with a crash course in Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p>Mr. McPhilemy's defense lawyers have listed 40 witnesses, among them Harold Evans, the former Random House publisher and former editor of The Sunday Times of London, and Colin Wallace, the former press officer for the British Army in Northern Ireland.</p>
        <p>The witness list for the Prentice brothers includes some 40 names, including David Trimble, the leader of the Ulster Unionist party in Northern Ireland, who testified earlier this year in a libel case in London arising from the documentary.</p>
        <p>In that case, Mr. McPhilemy won a libel suit that he filed against The Sunday Times of London for describing his documentary on a secret ruling committee as a hoax.</p>
        <p>For his documentary and book Mr. McPhilemy relied heavily on information provided by a Unionist supporter, James Alfred Sands, who was the only direct witness to provide the producers with taped descriptions of the committee's structure, meeting locations and members.</p>
        <p>Since then Mr. Sands has changed his statements several times, recanting and then reversing himself. He has told journalists that he would testify in the libel trial, but it is unclear whether either side will risk calling him.</p>
        <p>Mr. McPhilemy's lawyers said that they intended to argue that the author balanced his portrayal of the Prentices by including a blanket denial from everyone accused of committee involvement, along with information about a Royal Ulster Constabulary investigation that absolved them. Mr. Sands will also figure in the defense because the lawyers contend that the paperback version of the book appeared after Mr. Sands disavowed his recantation and offered fresh details about the Prentices last May.</p>
        <p>''I don't envy the jury on this case,'' said Jack Holland, the author of five books about Northern Ireland and a correspondent for The Irish Echo, the New York-based weekly. Mr. Holland elicited Mr. Sands's most recent comments, in which he said he offered information to Mr. McPhilemy as a joke. ''It's going to be hard for anyone to sort out the tangled history. Plus the interpretation of that tangled history is going to be warped by political agendas.''</p>
