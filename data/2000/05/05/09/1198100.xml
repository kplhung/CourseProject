        <p>He was cut by Pat Riley, renounced by Rick Pitino and traded by Larry Brown. On perseverance alone, you have to love Bruce Bowen's resume.</p>
        <p>His last pit stop before his current tour of duty, his third, with the Miami Heat? Bowen spent two days with the worst team in the Eastern Conference. Then the Chicago Bulls released him.</p>
        <p>It is one thing to be told by three of the game's alleged miracle workers that they like your talent and desire but you no longer fit into their salary cap or roster plans.</p>
        <p>But the Bulls? As if they can't give you a decent run before the lottery.</p>
        <p>You expect Bowen to nod his head with I-told-you-so satisfaction, take a thinly veiled shot at everyone who served him his walking papers.</p>
        <p>Instead, the player who appeared on the New York sports radar on Sunday in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals against the Knicks -- the rangy 6-foot-7-inch swingman who put a hand in Allan Houston's face, steered Latrell Sprewell toward the Heat front line and made an important 3-pointer in Miami's victory -- folded his arms and allowed a half-smile.</p>
        <p>''Part of the business,'' he said yesterday in the LaSalle High School gymnasium, where the Heat prepared for Game 2 tonight. ''I felt like I would play somewhere. It was just a matter of when.''</p>
        <p>Depending on your perspective, Bowen either arrived at the right place at the right time for Miami or else the Knicks were literally in the wrong place at the wrong time when he became available.</p>
        <p>Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy wanted Bowen badly for his ability to come off the bench to defend big guards aggressively. But the Heat claimed Bowen off waivers on Feb. 23 because of a quirk of timing. Under National Basketball Association rules, teams with inferior records get to claim players before those with better records. Feb. 23 happened to be one of only two days all season that the Knicks were in sole possession of first place in the Atlantic Division, ahead of the Heat.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of good fortune that goes into this,'' Van Gundy said. ''Everyone knows we wanted him, but it's just how it is.''</p>
        <p>Bowen is not a franchise player, but he is one of those athletic, long-limbed guys who make defenses better. He played 12 of the most efficient minutes off the Miami bench on Sunday, coming in to guard Houston and switching to Sprewell when Marcus Camby replaced Houston.</p>
        <p>Released by Riley after spending one week in training camp with Miami in 1995, Bowen was brought back for a month at the close of the 1996-97 season. He played in one game, and Riley did not re-sign him. Bowen also played for Pitino in Boston for two seasons before moving to Philadelphia last season.</p>
        <p>The 76ers, who liked him, shipped Bowen to Chicago to make financial room for Toni Kukoc in the three-team trade with the Golden State Warriors on Feb. 16. Bowen made it out of Chicago and into the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''I think God is moving in my life,'' he said. ''I'm a faithful person. It's not the peaches and cream in this league that a lot of people feel. It takes a lot of prayer and a lot of faith just to get by.''</p>
        <p>His big-picture perspective and likable demeanor helped his cause.</p>
        <p>He grew up in a tough neighborhood in Fresno, Calif., and turned down many opportunities to join the gang life, which claimed three of his cousins. Bowen went on to star at Cal State-Fullerton.</p>
        <p>Bowen was not drafted by the N.B.A., but he never got down about his journeyman plight. He viewed his playing for five teams in three years as valuable experience and tried not to focus on the rejections. When Riley first released him, Bowen thought it was cold.</p>
        <p>''I was disappointed,'' he said. ''It was my first actual league experience. Coming out of college, you don't ever think about the business side of everything. But I called and told him I appreciated the opportunity. I think that kind of caught him off guard, because so many guys leave without saying anything.''</p>
        <p>This season, with so many tall shooting guards carving up his team, Riley was happy to rehire Bowen. ''He basically said, 'We like your defense on the big guards in this league,' '' Bowen said.</p>
        <p>Riley said after Game 1: ''When Allan and Latrell Sprewell stare you in the eyes, some players get pretty defensive. Bruce is the opposite. He and Dan Majerle get after it.''</p>
        <p>Bowen is unsure how he will try to help contain Sprewell and Houston for the rest of the series, but he already has a fairly comprehensive scouting report laid out.</p>
        <p>''All he needs is a little space to get up,'' Bowen said of Houston. ''He can penetrate and kick, penetrate and pull up. You have to try and limit him with his air space and hopefully force him to beat you with the drive, if that's what you're trying to do.</p>
        <p>''And with Spree, he's great driving the ball, and he can shoot the ball as well. But he likes to take the ball to the basket more. When I move over to Spree, I have to think about the tendencies Spree may have and try to disrupt those a little bit.''</p>
        <p>Bowen is not likely to put up big numbers this week. But he will flail his arms and move his feet as fast as he can, trying to defuse the grand arsenal of Houston and Sprewell, building his resume one stop at a time.</p>
