        <p>I feel extremely frustrated whenever I'm asked to fill out a long medical history form on an initial visit to a doctor, a process described in the Personal Health column ''A Case for Expanding the Doctor's Checklist'' on May 2.</p>
        <p>Physicians rarely, if ever, read the form before coming into the examining room; the usual practice is, first, for the nurse and, then, the physician to come in and ask me many of the same questions that are on the form.</p>

        <p>I feel extremely frustrated whenever I'm asked to fill out a long medical history form on an initial visit to a doctor, a process described in the Personal Health column ''A Case for Expanding the Doctor's Checklist'' on May 2.</p>
        <p>Physicians rarely, if ever, read the form before coming into the examining room; the usual practice is, first, for the nurse and, then, the physician to come in and ask me many of the same questions that are on the form.</p>
        <p>I realize that time is precious, but what is the point of patients' being asked to spend much time and effort filling out such forms if no one is looking at them?</p>
