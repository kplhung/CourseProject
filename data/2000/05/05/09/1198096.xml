        <p>The latest polls show George W. Bush just a whisker ahead of Al Gore in overall voter approval ratings. But when asked about environmental protection, voters give Mr. Gore a double-digit advantage over Mr. Bush. Mr. Gore has begun to exploit this edge; in a speech last month, for example, he said Mr. Bush was only ''pretending to care'' about the environment.</p>
        <p>Other critics have attacked Mr. Bush's record, too, brandishing air quality statistics, which show that Texas ranks worst among states in total tons of air pollution.</p>
        <p>But as it turns out, the Texas governor's record is far better than activists allow. Governor Bush has tackled environmental problems creatively, with a new approach that emphasizes cooperation over conflict.</p>
        <p>Let's look at air quality. There are two reason why emissions in Texas are high. First, the state is large and produces much of the nation's oil and oil-based chemicals. The rest of the country enjoys the goods made possible by this production; Texas shoulders the burden.</p>
        <p>Second, Governor Bush's predecessors paid relatively little attention to air quality. Mr. Bush backed an initiative that made Texas only the third state in the nation to require pollution reductions from older power plants that had been exempted from the standards set for more modern ones. By 2003, the Bush plan aims to cut nitrogen oxide emissions, a component of smog, in half. The program included some voluntary commitments by companies, as well as requirements.</p>
        <p>This program represents a new environmentalism, which recognizes that most people and most companies want to do the right thing, and encourages them to do so through incentives.</p>
        <p>Governor Bush also expanded the ''clean industries 2000'' program, which was started in 1992 by Gov. Ann Richards. To participate, companies committed to cutting their toxic or hazardous waste in half by this year; in exchange, they may display a special environmental logo. So far, 185 companies have together eliminated more than 43 million tons of hazardous waste and reduced energy consumption by 11.3 million kilowatt hours. Through this and other programs, Texas actually led the nation in reducing toxic releases in 1997, the most recent year for which figures have been reported.</p>
        <p>During the governor's tenure, Texas has also encouraged voluntary conservation efforts. Starting with a budget of $100,000, and climbing this year to $2.5 million, a landowner incentive program is the first government plan in the country to pay qualified landowners up to $10,000 to help conserve rare species on their property. By using incentives, it has managed to do what the federal Endangered Species Act has not done -- inspire landowners to voluntarily make their land attractive to threatened animal species.</p>
        <p>Another conservation effort has helped farmers and ranchers develop plans for helping wildlife survive on  some 10 million acres. On state lands, Mr. Bush led in the creation of a privately financed endowment, bolstered by state appropriations, to restore and maintain every state park, wildlife area and fish hatchery.</p>
        <p>Some environmental groups don't like Mr. Bush's approach, which emphasizes incentives and voluntary agreements. But what matters are  results. Are pollutants being reduced? Is habitat being protected? Are old hazardous-waste sites getting cleaned up? On this score, Governor Bush's performance looks surprisingly good.</p>
