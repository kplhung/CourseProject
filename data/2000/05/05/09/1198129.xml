        <p>The United States and Britain agreed yesterday to provide limited help to a United Nations peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone that appears to be dazed and overwhelmed, with rebels killing civilians there and continuing to hold more than 500 United Nations soldiers hostage.</p>
        <p>Despite appeals from the United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, for a rapid reaction force, the Clinton administration agreed only to provide transport planes. The British began sending in 700 troops primarily to secure the airport near Freetown and assist with the evacuation of its nationals, but did not rule out using troops in ground fighting.</p>
        <p>Violence and confusion continued in the country, a former British colony.</p>
        <p>In Freetown, the capital, the rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, who is widely regarded in the West as a war criminal, slipped out of sight during a mass demonstration that turned into a deadly shootout near his compound. Soldiers loyal to Mr. Sankoh fired into a crowd of rock-throwing protesters, killing at least four.</p>
        <p>The administration was waiting for the outcome of a summit meeting of West African nations in Nigeria today to determine whether the peacekeeping force should be beefed up or essentially abandoned as a lost cause, American officials said.</p>
        <p>It was possible that the situation had deteriorated to such an extent and that rebel forces had gained so much control that there was no peace to keep, the officials said.</p>
        <p>While emphasizing that it will not send ground troops, the Clinton administration agreed yesterday to transport 700 Bangladeshi soldiers to the West African country. But the airlift has no timetable, and officials said it was not clear when the troops would be ready to leave. The United States also sent a military team to nearby Nigeria to help organize the movement of up to two Nigerian Army battalions to Sierra Leone.</p>
        <p>For several days, Mr. Annan has been asking Washington for help in airlifting peacekeepers from three battalions committed by Jordan, India and Bangladesh ahead of their scheduled deployment in Sierra Leone next month. The United Nations peacekeeping force is now about 2,300 short of its Security Council-mandated strength of 11,000.</p>
        <p>If Nigeria wants to send in new battalions operating as a West African force as it did in the past, not under the United Nations flag, the administration would favor such a move, the American officials said.</p>
        <p>Foreign Secretary Robin Cook said the British soldiers were not going as ''combat troops,'' but he left open the possibility that they could assist the United Nations peacekeepers. An advance force of 250 British paratroopers crossed into the country yesterday from Senegal, and 200 were flying in from Britain.</p>
        <p>Addressing Parliament, where the opposition Conservative Party expressed reservations about involvement by British troops in the fighting, Mr. Cook said, ''We must not allow a few thousand rebels to prevent the end to violence.''</p>
        <p>The British takeover of the airport would make it easier to fly reinforcements, and would enable the Americans to send their transports without additional ground support.</p>
        <p>At the United Nations, Mr. Annan scrambled on several fronts yesterday to stave off collapse of the peacekeeping mission. He met with Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright, who expressed enthusiastic, if vague, support for the mission.</p>
        <p>''We are looking at ways we can be supportive,'' Ms. Albright told reporters after their meeting. Asked whether that would include contributing to a rapid reaction force, the she said, ''We are looking at how to provide logistical support.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Albright, who was in New York for the funeral of Cardinal John O'Connor, declined to go into details of her private discussions with Mr. Annan beyond saying Sierra Leone was at the top of their list of topics.</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan said earlier that ''in addition to U.N. efforts, a rapid reaction force may be needed in Sierra Leone as soon as possible to assist in restoring conditions conducive to the resumption of the peace process.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan also appealed to Sierra Leone's neighbors, particularly Liberia and Guinea, to prevent rebels based on their soil from crossing back into Sierra Leone, according to his spokesman, Fred Eckhard. He said there were reports that some fighters were crossing, apparently to join the main guerrilla force.</p>
        <p>Liberia's president, Charles Taylor, has long supported Mr. Sankoh's Revolutionary United Front.</p>
        <p>As a precaution, Mr. Annan ordered the evacuation of 266 nonessential United Nations personnel from Sierra Leone, leaving 55 of his  civilian employees in the country. Some embassies and aid agencies have already flown out some of their employees and dependents.</p>
        <p>Some of the United Nations troops were being brought back into the capital to ensure they were not taken hostage, officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eckhard acknowledged yesterday that the United Nations' performance had been hampered by a breakdown in its outdated communications equipment, which made it difficult for the operations center in Freetown to stay in contact with units in the field. He also confirmed that the lightly armed peacekeepers arrived without tanks or artillery, the kind of heavy weapons that might have cowed the guerrillas.</p>
        <p>In the last week, the rebels have seized and are holding more than 500 United Nations peacekeepers, at least 400 of whom are Zambian, and taken their weapons and at least 13 armored personnel carriers.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the United Nations reduced the number of its soldiers reported killed from four to one, a Kenyan, with another Kenyan missing.</p>
        <p>The leaders of Sierra Leone and three other West African nations -- Guinea, Liberia and Mali -- met in Conakry yesterday with Oluyemi Adeniji, a Nigerian who is the United Nations' special representative to Sierra Leone.</p>
        <p>The Nigerian president, Olusegun Obasanjo, is to hold another meeting today of leaders of nine African countries, including Sierre Leone and Liberia, in Nigeria's capital, Abuja.</p>
        <p>Nigerian troops battled the rebels as part of a West African force before the United Nations peacemakers arrived. Their departure, which concluded last week, apparently helped embolden Mr. Sankoh's fighters to turn on the peacekeepers, who were trying to secure territory in rebel-held parts of Sierra Leone where diamonds are mined. The rebels have supported their war and enriched their leaders by smuggling diamonds into the international market through Liberia.</p>
        <p>For most of an eight-year civil war, Mr. Sankoh's rebels allied with another rebel group, the Armed Forces Revolutionary Council led by Johnny Paul Koroma, to form a fighting force of about 45,000. They fought against a government led by President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah and the West African peacekeeping force headed by Nigeria.</p>
        <p>A United Nations-brokered peace deal last July made Mr. Sankoh a member of the government and protected him and his troops from prosecution for war crimes. But his fighters never laid down their weapons, despite Mr. Sankoh's promises.</p>
