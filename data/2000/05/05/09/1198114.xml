        <p>A Long Island doctor who returned home Sunday morning after working the late shift knew right away that he had made a ghastly mistake, the police said.</p>
        <p>When Dr. Andrei Kranz, 42, opened his door, he found six family members and friends dead in bed, all in their nightclothes. Among them were his parents and his 3-year-old daughter, Simina. He tried to resuscitate them and failed.</p>
        <p>According to the police, the moment the doctor saw the bodies he suspected that the victims had died of carbon monoxide poisoning. He told the police that he had disconnected a carbon monoxide detector last summer because the alarm was constantly going off, keeping him and his family from sleep.</p>
        <p>''One of the first statements he made was that he said he had problems in the past with the detector being so sensitive, and he had shut it off,'' said Detective Robert Edwards of the Nassau County Homicide Squad. ''He's a doctor and he sees six people dead. He has a good idea of what happened.''</p>
        <p>The cause of death was accidental carbon monoxide intoxication, said Diane Makunas, a spokeswoman for the county medical examiner.</p>
        <p>Detective Edwards attributed the poisoning to ''an antagonistic relationship'' between the heating and cooling systems. The furnace and the air-conditioning system are both in a closed basement room of Dr. Kranz's home. The exhaust vent for the air-conditioner was closed and its intake filter was clogged.</p>
        <p>As the heat turned oppressive Friday afternoon, someone in the house turned on the air-conditioning without turning off the furnace, the police said. With no other source of air, the conditioner pulled in the furnace fumes, cooled them and sent the fumes throughout the house.</p>
        <p>North Hempstead town officials said that while there was a record for the installation of a gas furnace in the house, at 27 Parkway Drive, there was no record of a permit request for the installation of a central air-conditioning system.</p>
        <p>The victims were Dr. Kranz's parents, Marcus Kranz, 85, and Victoria Kranz, 74, also of Roslyn Heights; his daughter, Simina; a live-in nanny, Emelia Dumtru, 58; and two house guests, Dr. Emil Campeanu, 75, and his wife, Maria, 68, of Romania.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kranz's wife, Anka, and stepdaughter were in Romania on family business and had left for home, family friends said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kranz, a radiology resident at the Nassau County Medical Center, returned home at 9:30 a.m. Sunday. Neighbors saw him stumble outside with the limp body of his daughter in his arms, unable to cry because he, too, was overcome by the fumes.</p>
        <p>''He just said, 'She's gone,' '' Zaib Ainechi, 36, told a throng of reporters who arrived on her doorstep this afternoon. ''My daughter played with their daughter and I haven't been able to tell her yet,'' Mrs. Ainechi said as her eyes welled up.</p>
        <p>There were others who shed tears. Marilyn Meyer was a next-door neighbor for 25 years to the elder Kranzes, who became a second family to her when her husband died five years ago.</p>
        <p>''You always read they were such nice people in the newspapers, but these were really nice people,'' Mrs. Meyers said.</p>
        <p>Marcus Kranz had worked as a chemist for a perfume manufacturer; Mrs. Kranz was a chief chemist at Long Island Jewish Hospital. Mr. Kranz, who was known to his friends as ''Moosou,'' was a survivor of a World War II concentration camp.</p>
        <p>''There wasn't a night that went by where he didn't suffer from nightmares,'' Mrs. Meyers said. ''Now he dies like this. How sad and ironic.''</p>
        <p>The grandparents were staying at their son's home because Simina was ill. The police now suspect that her flulike symptoms were the result of exposure to the fumes Friday night.</p>
        <p>The two house guests, the Campeanus, had just spent a month visiting their son in Florida and had come to see Dr. Kranz, who had studied with Dr. Campeanu in Romania, before returning home.</p>
        <p>There are about 200 carbon monoxide poisonings a year in the United States, said Dan Newman, head nurse for the hyperbaric chamber at the Nassau County Medical Center. Most poisonings are caused by malfunctioning cars or kerosene heaters in tents, Mr. Newman said. Other household sources of carbon monoxide are fireplaces, water heaters, clothes dryers and gas ovens.</p>
        <p>To prevent such accidents, the authorities suggest having furnaces and appliances inspected regularly, and making sure there is proper ventilation around stoves and furnaces. Carbon monoxide detectors are also recommended.</p>
        <p>David I. Wasserman, the commissioner of buildings, safety and inspection in Roslyn Heights and a neighbor of the Kranzes, said there was no state law, and therefore no town law, requiring carbon monoxide detectors in homes.</p>
        <p>''While there should be,'' he said, ''it takes a long time, and unfortunately a tragedy like this, to change the law.''</p>
