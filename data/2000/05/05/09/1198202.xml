        <p>At this point, it's not as if Sister Janet Baxendale needs to provide credentials for her role: the woman in charge of planning the liturgy for the funeral Mass celebrating the life of the man who led the nation's most influential Roman Catholic archdiocese.</p>
        <p>Sister Janet was, after all, one of the people instrumental in planning the liturgy for Cardinal Terence Cooke's funeral in 1983. She had the same role for the installation ceremony for John O'Connor the next year. And for the ordination ceremonies of ''I really can't count how many bishops'' in between.</p>

        <p>At this point, it's not as if Sister Janet Baxendale needs to provide credentials for her role: the woman in charge of planning the liturgy for the funeral Mass celebrating the life of the man who led the nation's most influential Roman Catholic archdiocese.</p>
        <p>Sister Janet was, after all, one of the people instrumental in planning the liturgy for Cardinal Terence Cooke's funeral in 1983. She had the same role for the installation ceremony for John O'Connor the next year. And for the ordination ceremonies of ''I really can't count how many bishops'' in between.</p>
        <p>But if another resume item is needed, one need only look at the small picture behind her desk at the Catholic Center, the archdiocesan headquarters on First Avenue. The photograph shows ''a very, very tired Pope John Paul II and a pretty tired Sister Janet'' greeting each other with wan smiles after the pope's 1995 Mass in Central Park, which Sister Janet pulled off without a hitch. (She had some help staving off the rain.)</p>
        <p>After the funeral Mass yesterday, Sister Janet eased herself into a wrought-iron chair in the courtyard of the New York Palace Hotel, across Madison Avenue from St. Patrick's Cathedral. It felt like the first time she had stopped moving since Cardinal O'Connor died; she was also responsible for the liturgies of the weekend Masses for the cardinal.</p>
        <p>''This is something like the papal visit,'' she explained, ''except that the planning has been telescoped into really just four days.'' She added, with perspiration beading beneath her glasses, ''There are only so many hours in any day, and so much energy in any human being.''</p>
        <p>Asked if she was happy with the results, her answer was more choreographer than Sister of Charity. ''Well, I wish there had been more music to cover the action and so forth. There are always glitches.''</p>
        <p>''But over all,'' she added, ''I think it was a wonderful send-off.''</p>
        <p>For 24 years, Sister Janet has been in charge of the archdiocese's Office of Liturgy, which among other things answers parishes' sometimes sticky  questions about interpretation of liturgical directions from Rome.</p>
        <p>She seems to have been born for the job. Her first English paper as an undergraduate at Manhattan College was on Gregorian chant. Also, her friends accuse her of having the soul of a professional planner.</p>
        <p>''They say I never finish my sentences,'' she said, smiling as she finished that one.</p>
