        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As a psychologist who has treated many patients with memories of childhood sexual abuse, I applaud the debunking of highly questionable techniques for helping patients ''discover'' their traumatic pasts (''Memories of Things That Never Were,'' April 25).</p>
        <p>But I fear the column may leave the impression that adult claims of childhood sexual abuse are more often than not false.</p>
        <p>Numerous studies have estimated that 25 percent to 33 percent of adult women have had some form of sexual encounter with an adult before age 18.</p>
        <p>There is no question that some adults have experienced traumatic childhood sexual abuse that was repressed and suffer from symptoms related to that abuse. Through therapy, it is not unusual for patients to become conscious of previously repressed memories, including memories of childhood sexual abuse.</p>
        <p>This awareness is healing as it leads to an integrated sense of self and an increased capacity to change.</p>
        <p>The False Memory Syndrome Foundation may provide much needed help to family members falsely accused of sexual abuse. But surely it is as unable to assess the veracity of accused abusers' denials as therapists are unable to assess the veracity of patients' accusations.</p>

        <p>The writer is a licensed clinical psychologist.</p>
