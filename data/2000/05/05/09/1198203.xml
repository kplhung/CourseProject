        <p>Just before 2 p.m., Ian Dowding followed a line of archbishops up the stairs at the rear of St. Patrick's Cathedral.</p>
        <p>John Bellew, a friend standing on the sidewalk, flagged Mr. Dowding and asked him what he was up to. Mr. Dowding smiled widely.</p>
        <p>''I'm the priest herder,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Half an hour earlier, the line of seminarians, deacons, Franciscan brothers, parish priests, bishops and archbishops that walked two by two into St. Patrick's swarmed chaotically inside the New York Palace Hotel across Madison Avenue. In the middle stood Mr. Dowding.</p>
        <p>With a booming voice and no compunction about using it to order about men of God, Mr. Dowding was chosen by the archdiocese to organize the procession of 1,500 clergymen into Cardinal O'Connor's funeral.</p>
        <p>''This way, Father,'' Mr. Dowding said to one priest looking for the ballroom where he could don his white alb and chasuble. ''We have water, coffee and soda. No beer till after the funeral.''</p>
        <p>A retired businessman, Mr. Dowding has spent much of the last three years volunteering at the cathedral, organizing and giving tours. He knows many of the priests and yesterday greeted those he knows best with a firm handshake, including the Rev. Gerard Gordon, with the Diocese of Rockville Centre, N.Y.</p>
        <p>''Oftentimes the clergy have to be organized,'' said Father Gordon, who went on a trip to the Holy Land with Mr. Dowding last year. ''And he organizes with a loud voice but a great sense of humor.''</p>
        <p>As clocks passed 1:30 p.m., Mr. Dowding appeared to gain the upper hand over the crowd of priests, prodding the seminarians to the front of the line and the bishops to the back.</p>
        <p>As the end of the line moved out of the hotel at 1:45 p.m., a priest ran up to the end, only to be gently waved away by Mr. Dowding.</p>
        <p>''Father, you have got to run to the front of the line,'' Mr. Dowding said. ''I am sorry, I don't have the power to make you an archbishop.''</p>
