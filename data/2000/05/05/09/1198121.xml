        <p>The Energy Department said today that it had failed in its attempt to save money on nuclear waste cleanup by privatizing the task of solidifying highly radioactive liquid wastes at the Hanford nuclear reservation in Washington State.</p>
        <p>The department said that it was canceling its contract with BNFL Inc., which was supposed to finance and build a waste-processing factory and run it for almost 20 years, receiving most of its pay only when it produced a product.</p>
        <p>By dismissing the contractor, the department risks missing court-sanctioned deadlines that it had agreed on with Washington State and the federal Environmental Protection Agency for the cleanup of the Hanford plant.</p>
        <p>Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said in a statement that ''BNFL's proposal was outrageously expensive and inadequate in many ways.''</p>
        <p>The department said the company, whose budget estimates for the job had more than doubled in less than two years, will be kept on to do some design work; it will be paid $200 million to $300 million for the design work and for its glass-melting technology. But the job of finishing the design, building the plant and running it will be opened up for bidding.</p>
        <p>The plant is supposed to produce liquid wastes encased in a radiation-absorbing glass and wrapped in stainless steel for long-term storage. The Energy Department chose BNFL, an American subsidiary of British Nuclear Fuels P.L.C., because the British parent had done similar work in England.</p>
        <p>When the initial contract was signed in August 1998, BNFL said it could do the job for $6.9 billion. More recently, it said the cost would be $15.2 billion.</p>
        <p>The Washington Attorney General, Christine O. Gregoire, who negotiated cleanup deadlines, said in an interview that delays had been predictable because of ''bad business decisions'' by the Energy Department.</p>
        <p>The original concept, she pointed out, was for two private companies to compete, but the department had narrowed the field to just BNFL, which allowed that company to ''commit highway robbery,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In a statement, BNFL said that ''while disappointed that the Department of Energy has decided to recompete the entirety of the contract, we are pleased that they have determined that the design and technical solution is sound and will be the basis for proceeding with the cleanup.''</p>
        <p>T. J. Glauthier, the deputy secretary of energy, acknowledged in a telephone interview with reporters that the department had a history of delays and cost overruns and was still looking for a way to give contractors an incentive to do their work on time and on budget. He said the department might try privatizing another task, but one with fewer uncertainties.</p>
        <p>''We're pretty unhappy with the performance this contractor has had,'' he said. ''We're taking an unusual step, terminating this contract.''</p>
        <p>In fact, the department's experience in the glass-making technology, called vitrification, has been poor. A plant built under a traditional contract at the Savannah River nuclear reservation, near Aiken, S.C., opened late, and engineers still have not determined how to stop the wastes from producing benzene, a gas that can burn or explode at the proper concentration. The waste at Hanford, in south central Washington State, is stored in underground tanks, some of which are leaking.</p>
