        <p>FBI's preliminary crime report for 1999 found decline in nation's murder rate since 1991, long driven by decreases in homicides in big cities, is taking hold in small cities, suburbs and rural areas; shows while homicides dropped 2 percent in cities with population of half million or more, they declined 10 percent in cities of 100,000 to 250,000, 12 percent in cities of 50,000 to 100,000 people and 14 percent in communities of 10,000 to 25,000 people; in suburban counties number of murders fell 12 percent overall, and 14 percent in rural counties; chart (M)</p>

        <p>High Point, N.C., has not had a drug- or gang-related murder in the past 18 months, after a stunning surge in homicides in the years before that.</p>
        <p>In Natchez, Miss., the number of murders dropped to one in 1999, after reaching a dozen a few years before.</p>
        <p>And in Oceanside, Calif., where there were as many as 25 homicides as recently as 1995, there were 7 last year.</p>
        <p>These drops in murders are an important indication that the decline in the nation's murder rate since 1991, long driven by decreases in homicide in the big cities, is now starting to take hold in small cities, suburbs and rural areas across the country.</p>
        <p>This trend was underscored by the release on Sunday of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's preliminary crime report for 1999, which showed that while homicides dropped 2 percent in cities with a population of half a million or more, they declined 10 percent in cities of 100,000 to 250,000, 12 percent in cities of 50,000 to 100,000 people and 14 percent in communities of 10,000 to 25,000 people. Over all, in suburban counties, the number of murders fell 12 percent, and 14 percent in rural counties.</p>
        <p>In fact, the smaller the community, the bigger the decrease in murders, according to the F.B.I. study, known as the Uniform Crime Report, which is based on figures supplied by police forces around the country.</p>
        <p>Just as in big cities, officials in these smaller communities attribute the decline to a mix of factors, including their own innovative programs, an improved economy and longer prison sentences.</p>
        <p>In High Point, a city of 76,000, federal, state and local law enforcement agencies, drawing on a program pioneered in Boston, worked together to focus on drug dealers who had moved in from as far away as Los Angeles and Mexico. In Natchez, an antebellum tourist town of 19,000, officials say a strategy of community policing and four new officers financed by a Clinton administration program helped cut crime.</p>
        <p>In Oceanside, a community of 160,000 north of San Diego, the waning of the crack cocaine epidemic, a healthy economy that reduced unemployment and California's ''three strikes and you're out'' sentencing laws all contributed to a reduction in crime, local officials say.</p>
        <p>The reason behind the trend, said Prof. Alfred Blumstein, a criminologist at Carnegie Mellon University, is related to the reason the murder rate first increased in the mid-1980's. It was the major cities that were initially hit by crack cocaine, and then by the infestation of semiautomatic handguns and gangs that accompanied the crack epidemic, he said. The smaller cities and rural areas were slower to become involved in the crack problem, and just as they lagged behind in the growth of crime, ''they are slower to come down,'' Professor Blumstein said.</p>
        <p>In fact, some smaller cities and rural areas have been victims of the success the larger cities had in suppressing crime. This led drug dealers and gangs to move to the small communities.</p>
        <p>''What we saw in North Carolina, as law enforcement picked up the pressure in the big cities in the mid-1990's, was that the gangs purposely moved out to smaller places,'' said Walter Holton, the United States attorney for the Middle District of North Carolina, in Greensboro.</p>
        <p>Mexican gangs arrived at the same time as an influx of Hispanic families moving to North Carolina to work in the state's rapidly expanding industries, disguising their illicit activities, Mr. Holton said.</p>
        <p>In addition, some gang members traveled back and forth from Los Angeles to High Point, bringing drugs to sell. ''They infiltrated the local market, becoming the major suppliers, and in the process used violence for intimidation to take over the city,'' Mr. Holton added.</p>
        <p>But while the sharp decline in homicide in smaller communities now is seen as a positive sign, several experts said they were concerned that the slowing of the decrease in murder in big cities could mean the country is nearing the end of the remarkable fall in murder after eight consecutive years. ''The big cities are signaling the end of the downturn is near,'' said James Allen Fox, Lipmann professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University.</p>
        <p>Professor Blumstein has calculated that with the huge reduction in murder in the past few years, ''If the trend continued, we would have a negative homicide rate, and that would occur in 2007.''</p>
        <p>Equally worrisome, the experts said, several big cities actually had increases in murder in 1999 for the first time since 1991, including San Diego, up 35.7 percent, St. Louis, up 15 percent, Phoenix, up 14.6 percent, Milwaukee, up 11.7 percent, and New York, up 6 percent.</p>
        <p>''We have been getting at the easy problems, so now that we've gotten the easy gains, there should be a flattening out'' in the overall decline, Professor Blumstein said. Among these gains, he said, were a shrinkage in the crack market and successful police tactics aimed at persuading young people not to carry guns.</p>
