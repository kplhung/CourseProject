        <p>Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor, the eighth archbishop of New York, whose wit and uncompromising eloquence made him the most visible spiritual leader of Roman Catholics across the United States, was entombed beneath the altar of St. Patrick's Cathedral yesterday in an ethereal ceremony of white-robed clerics and haunting song.</p>
        <p>Reflecting the stature that Cardinal O'Connor had achieved during his 16 years running the Archdiocese of New York, political and religious leaders from around the country joined New Yorkers to honor a man whose insistence on church teachings had defied the secular labels of liberal and conservative politics.</p>
        <p>Led by acolytes bearing incense and holding high the archbishopric cross, with its distinctive double crossbeams, a procession of more than 2,000 deacons, priests, bishops, nuns and cardinals marched down the central aisle of the cathedral at 1:30 p.m., passing alongside the cardinal's mahogany coffin, which was draped in a white linen pall. As they passed, they rested their hands on the coffin briefly, before moving on.</p>
        <p>''He made this pulpit unique in the history of the Catholic Church in the United States,'' said Cardinal Bernard Law of Boston in a homily that was interrupted by a standing ovation of nearly two minutes after he invoked Cardinal O'Connor's ''constant reminder that the church must always be unambiguously pro-life.''</p>
        <p>Surveying the congregation, now on its feet, Cardinal Law added, ''I see he hasn't left the pulpit.''</p>
        <p>''God gifted him with a keen and subtle intellect, an uncommon rhetorical skill, a knack for the dramatic gesture, a sharp wit and an outrageous sense of humor, all of which he used in the service of preaching,'' said Cardinal Law, who was near Cardinal O'Connor when he died last Wednesday night at the age of 80, after a protracted battle with cancer that began late last summer with surgery to remove a brain tumor.</p>
        <p>Among the dignitaries attending the invitation-only funeral were President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton, who sat beside Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper Gore. Behind the President sat Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, the first lady's rival for the United States Senate seat being vacated by Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who was also present. Mrs. Clinton shook hands with Mayor Giuliani during the ''kiss of peace'' that is part of the Catholic Mass. On the other side of the coffin, alongside Cardinal O'Connor's family, sat former President George Bush, who was a friend of the cardinal's. Elsewhere in the audience sat Mr. Bush's son, George W. Bush, with his wife, Laura.</p>
        <p>About 15 cardinals, the highest-ranking clerics in the Roman Catholic Church after the pope, also turned out to usher Cardinal O'Connor to his final resting place, as did an equal number of archbishops and 300 bishops. One of them, seated prominently in the sanctuary, was the man expected to succeed Cardinal O'Connor, Bishop Edward M. Egan of Bridgeport, Conn.</p>
        <p>Also attending were all of the others whose names have figured prominently in speculation about a successor: Archbishops Theodore E. McCarrick of Newark, Justin F. Rigali of St. Louis and Edwin F. O'Brien of the military archdiocese, along with Bishops Henry Mansell of Buffalo, Sean O'Malley of Fall River, Mass., and Donald Wuerl of Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>Though few nuns attended, other than mothers superior, two orders held prominent places. One was Mother Teresa's Missionaries of Charity. The other was the Sisters of Life, a New York-based order founded by Cardinal O'Connor, whose 30 members devote themselves to protecting the sanctity of life, whether by running shelters for unwed mothers or by ministering to the sick and elderly.</p>
        <p>More than 3,500 mourners filled the cathedral, whose walls echoed with the hymns and speeches celebrating the eternal life on whose threshold the faithful believe Cardinal O'Connor now stands. Much of the service, which ran nearly three hours from the procession that opened it to the one that ended it,  reflected choices the cardinal had made as he prepared for his death -- from the selection of Cardinal Law to  deliver the homily, to the abundance and choice of music.</p>
        <p>The diocesan priests and bishops wore white, in keeping with their belief that death is not the end of life, but a time of rebirth. In contrast with Masses held in the first days after Cardinal O'Connor's death, few in the pews wept.</p>
        <p>Outside the cathedral, hundreds  stood in wilting temperatures that reached the 90's, in rows 8 to 10 people deep, to hear the service, which was broadcast over loudspeakers. Twenty-five Red Cross workers handed out lemonade and water. Police officers sweltered in their formal uniforms: long-sleeved shirts, ties and woolen jackets.</p>
        <p>Strictly speaking, John O'Connor was the direct spiritual leader only of the 2.4 million Catholics of his own archdiocese, which covered Manhattan, the Bronx and Staten Island, along with seven counties north of the city. But his influence extended to millions more Catholics throughout the New York region, and perhaps the country, who traveled from all parts of the region and nation to pay their respects yesterday.</p>
        <p>Jerry Kennedy, a banking consultant from Old Bridge, N.J., had come with his four brothers to watch the spectacle outside the cathedral. ''I used to wave to the cardinal every St. Patrick's Day, and he would wave back,'' Mr. Kennedy said. ''This is my final wave.''</p>
        <p>From Rome came Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Vatican's secretary of state, who led the Mass of Christian Burial. ''Lord, we do not complain that you have taken him from us,'' he prayed. ''Rather we will thank you for giving him to us.''</p>
        <p>Cardinal O'Connor's stands on political issues sprang from his faith in the Gospel, making it difficult to brand him conservative or liberal.  From the start of his tenure in 1984, he acquired a reputation as a conservative, preaching strict adherence to traditional Church doctrines abjuring homosexuality, abortion and contraception. And he assailed Catholic politicians, like Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Geraldine A. Ferraro, who he felt strayed from those views.</p>
        <p>But in later years, the cardinal's  image as a conservative blurred as he he spoke out for the rights of workers and the dispossessed, and opposed capital punishment and euthanasia. Nevertheless, it was the cardinal's untiring efforts to outlaw abortion that perhaps drew the greatest attention to him, and that yesterday sparked an unscripted show of devotion: a sustained, standing ovation, which began when one of the Sisters of Life rose to her feet.</p>
        <p>Bishop Robert A. Brucato, one of Cardinal O'Connor's two vicars general, his top lieutenants, said it was  the cardinal's unabashed use of the media -- in the media capital of the world -- to assert church doctrine, whether in the secular or religious arena, that distinguished him. Bishop Brucato made a point of welcoming the millions of Catholics watching the funeral on television.</p>
        <p>In a brief talk about Cardinal O'Connor, Cardinal William Baum, head of penitential services like confessions and indulgences in the Vatican, noted that Cardinal O'Connor's patron saint was St. John Fisher, who was beheaded for treason in 1535 by King Henry VIII of England after refusing to renounce the Catholic Church.</p>
        <p>''Cardinal O'Connor wasn't decapitated,'' Cardinal Baum said. ''He didn't die for his faith, but he did proclaim it, and he suffered.'' Cardinal Baum recalled that Cardinal O'Connor had asked Catholics to pray for his soul after his death.</p>
        <p>At 3:35, after many in the cathedral, including Mayor Giuliani, had lined the aisles to receive holy communion, Cardinal Sodano sprinkled  Cardinal O'Connor's coffin with holy water, as a thurifer waved incense that rose toward the cathedral's vaulted ceilings. There hung the traditional red hats, or galleros, of the  New York archbishops before Cardinal Francis Spellman, who was installed in 1939.</p>
        <p>In solemn procession, Cardinal Sodano led the coffin up the center aisle and down the side, as the choir and the congregants sang ''May the Angels Take You Into Paradise.'' Behind him walked other cardinals and a few members of Cardinal O'Connor's family, including his two sisters, Mary Ward and Dorothy Hamilton, and his brother Thomas.</p>
        <p>A smaller group, consisting only of Cardinal Sodano, a few other church officials and Cardinal O'Connor's family, entered the crypt to see the cardinal placed in his tomb, alongside the tombs of other prelates. With little space in the crypt, the other cardinals waited outside as Cardinal O'Connor's coffin was slipped in beside that of Archbishop John J. Maguire.</p>
        <p>In the sanctuary upstairs, the bishops stood through the half-hour entombent in silence, with their backs to the pews. Congregants, too, stood in silent farewell.</p>
        <p>On the stone that sealed the cardinal in his crypt is a simple inscription, bearing his name and age, and the years he served as archbishop of New York. Also carved in the stone is his coat of arms, emblazoned with the words Cardinal O'Connor chose to give meaning to his mission: ''There can be no love without justice.''</p>
