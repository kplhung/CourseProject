        <p>Practically the only exports these days from the nations of the former Soviet Union are world-class athletes. That is a situation that is not likely to change, particularly with the top club in Ukraine, Dynamo Kiev.</p>
        <p>In the past year, Dynamo has sold its international defender Oleh Luzhny to Arsenal of the English Premier League and striker Andrii Shevchenko to A.C. Milan in Italy for a $25 million transfer fee. Now the club is close to peddling its top scorer, striker Serhii Rebrov, to either Tottenham, Arsenal or Milan, according to the club's president, Grigoriy M. Surkis.</p>
        <p>''Right now, it's natural for our players to want to leave,'' Surkis said last week during an interview in New York. ''For us to ever be able to import players is not so simple. I compare Ukraine to a desert where a tree finds it hard to grow. We don't only want mediocre players. A star player is like a tree, and that tree will find our country to be a desert.''</p>
        <p>Rebrov currently leads the Ukrainian league with 18 goals in 23 games. Dynamo has a 17-point lead in the league standing. The club, under the direction of the fabled Valery Lobanovsky, played credibly in the European Champions League this season before being eliminated in the second round of group play. In previous tournaments, Dynamo advanced to the quarterfinals and semifinals in successive seasons. Lobanovsky, who had been the national team coach of the Soviet Union in the 1970's and 80's, was recently appointed as national team coach of Ukraine after Jozef Szabo resigned following a loss to Slovenia in qualifying for the European Championships. He will retain his job in Kiev, Surkis said.</p>
        <p>Surkis is a successful businessman with interests in oil, banking, the news media and commodity trading and is also a member of the Ukrainian Parliament. He rescued the club from insolvency and has seen it win six straight league titles and three doubles (cup and league championships) in 1993, '96 and '98.</p>
        <p>Since Surkis took over the club, Dynamo has built a sports academy that has developed players like Shevchenko and Rebrov, home-grown talents who eventually earn valuable foreign exchange for the club.</p>
        <p>''Shevchenko was only 11 years old when he made his first trip to Milan and saw the San Siro Stadium,'' Surkis said. ''On that day he told me that he wanted to play there. Our academy creates social conditions for the players, with living quarters, new cars, furnished apartments. What we try to do is get them to concentrate on soccer.''</p>
        <p>For now, Dynamo Kiev will have to rely on its home-grown talent and players imported from other countries that were once part of the Soviet Union. The club's roster now includes three players from Belarus, two from Russia, one from Uzbekistan and one from Georgia.</p>
        <p>KANSAS CITY WIZARDS</p>
        <p>Kansas City has a 6-0-2 record and 20 points after a 0-0 draw in Los Angeles on Saturday night to lead Major League Soccer's Western Division. The Wizards finished with an 8-24 record last season, second in futility to the MetroStars. The MetroStars play at Arrowhead Stadium this Saturday night and will be facing their former goalkeeper Tony Meola, who appears to have salvaged his career.</p>
        <p>Meola, 31, missed most of last season with a knee injury after being traded to Kansas City by the MetroStars. This season has been different, however, and now Meola, a native of Kearny, N.J., is near the top of Bruce Arena's list for the United States national team.</p>
        <p>Meola is the league's top goalkeeper with six shutouts (he has an M.L.S. record 27 in his career) and a gaudy 0.49 goals against average (0.19 goal against in April). He has not allowed a goal in the past 345 minutes. (The league record is 414 minutes, a record Meola set in 1996.) The Wizards have the league's best goal differential (17 goals for, only 4 against).</p>
        <p>With Kasey Keller (Rayo Vallecano in Spain) and Brad Freidel (Liverpool in England) having seen limited playing time during the past couple of months, Meola could get a call-up to the national team as World Cup qualifying approaches in July.</p>
        <p>CORNER KICKS</p>
        <p>Two famous European clubs are going in opposite directions. Atletico Madrid, a nine-time champion, dropped out of Spain's Primera Liga for the first time in 65 years. Atletico became the first Spanish club to be relegated in the same season as reaching the Spanish Cup final. In England, Manchester City was promoted to the Premier League after an absence of four seasons.  Adin Brown, the goalie for the M.L.S. Colorado Rapids and the United States Olympic team, is being pursued by Rosenborg of Norway. Rapids officials are none too pleased that M.L.S., which owns all player contracts, is considering a move that could net the league a substantial transfer fee and leave the Rapids little to show.</p>
