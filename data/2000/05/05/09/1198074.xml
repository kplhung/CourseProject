        <p>Uganda and Rwanda agreed today to withdraw all their troops from the third largest city in Congo and to let United Nations forces take over the area.</p>
        <p>If the two nations stick to their pledges, the city, Kisangani, and its immediate surroundings will become the first ''neutral'' region of Congo, controlled by neither President Laurent Kabila's government nor by his enemies. Security Council members who brokered the deal say they will urge Secretary General Kofi Annan to start sending monitors backed by troops as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>More broadly the agreement, finally completed today in a meeting between seven Security Council members on a peace mission to Africa and President Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, allows virtually every African leader involved in the Congo war to retreat from the conflict without appearing to back down. Backtracking by any one of them could sink the delicate process of untangling a complex war.</p>
        <p>Richard C. Holbrooke, the American ambassador to the United Nations and the leader of the Security Council mission, said after the agreement was announced here that Rwanda and Uganda, close allies, were eager to put a clash last week over Kisangani behind them.</p>
        <p>''This is something both presidents want,'' Mr. Holbrooke said. ''It was not imposed on them by the Security Council. We just happen to be in the neighborhood.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Holbrooke spoke by telephone today with Mr. Kabila and President Robert Mugabe of Zimbabwe, who supports Mr. Kabila with 12,000 troops, and said they were pleased with the accord. Mr. Mugabe told the delegation on Saturday that he was prepared to discuss a withdrawal but would not be the first to leave. Mr. Kabila has always argued that the war is not a civil war but a result of an invasion by Rwanda and Uganda.</p>
        <p>Leaders of some Congolese rebel groups met the Security Council delegation. But they are not seen as much of a problem if their backers in Rawnda and Uganda choose to revive the flagging peace accord, which was signed in July.</p>
        <p>Mr. Museveni said after the talks here that he and President Paul Kagame of Rwanda would meet on Sunday to plan their moves in cooperation with the United Nations mission and a military commission that represents all six nations in the conflict, including Namibia and Angola.</p>
        <p>Mr. Museveni said the tensions with Rwanda on Congolese territory are ''taking us away from our legitimate problems, which are the presence of the Interahamwe there and the use of Congo by Sudan to send terrorists into Uganda.''</p>
        <p>The Interahamwe are ethnic Hutu militias responsible for carrying out a genocidal campaign against Tutsi and their moderate Hutu supporters in Rwanda in 1994. When a Tutsi-led government took over that year, the Hutu fled to eastern Congo, then Zaire. At that time, Rwanda and Uganda were backing Mr. Kabila in his drive against Zaire's dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko. About a year after Mr. Kabila took power in Kinshasa, Rwanda and Uganda took up arms against him.</p>
        <p>Part of an agreement announced on Sunday in Kigali, the Rwandan capital, calls for a program to identify the Interahamwe still in Congo and offer them reintegration into Rwanda or settlement in a third country.</p>
        <p>Some diplomats are skeptical of Rwanda's promises, saying Mr. Kagami's government has successfully exported its major problem with militant Hutu and has no reason to want to see them rehabilitated. Also, some diplomats say, if densely populated Rwanda is really in Congo for the resources -- diamonds, gold, timber and rich agricultural land -- the Interahamwe serve as a convenient excuse for keeping troops there.</p>
        <p>Kisangani, called Stanleyville in colonial times, is an important city of nearly two million people and the capital of a diamond-producing province, Orientale. It has long been an important port, built on the Congo River at the point where it ceases to be navigable for trade. Some United Nations officials in Kinshasa, the Congo capital, saw the perennial fighting in Kisangani as a squabble over spoils. If that is the prime motivation, keeping Kisangani neutral may not be easy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holbrooke said today that sending in United Nations forces to the city would ''now become, in our recommendation, the most urgent next action.''</p>
        <p>Asked whether the Sierra Leone crisis would hurt recruiting for the far more complex Congo operation, Mr. Holbrooke said: ''None of us in the delegation think that what's happening in Sierra Leone or even in the Horn of Africa directly affects the Lusaka peace process on Congo. However, we all recognize the political context in which these decisions are made. That's undeniable.''</p>
