        <p>The 3Com Corporation, whose shares have been trading as if the entire company was worth less than the shares it owns in  Palm Inc., said yesterday that it would distribute its Palm shares to its own shareholders in late July.</p>
        <p>The announcement, which came after 3Com received a favorable ruling from the Internal Revenue Service certifying that the spinoff would be tax-free, sets the stage for the closing of the stock price gap that has existed ever since Palm went public in early March. Since then, Palm has traded at prices that appear to be unreasonably high relative to the price of 3Com shares.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The 3Com Corporation, whose shares have been trading as if the entire company was worth less than the shares it owns in  Palm Inc., said yesterday that it would distribute its Palm shares to its own shareholders in late July.</p>
        <p>The announcement, which came after 3Com received a favorable ruling from the Internal Revenue Service certifying that the spinoff would be tax-free, sets the stage for the closing of the stock price gap that has existed ever since Palm went public in early March. Since then, Palm has traded at prices that appear to be unreasonably high relative to the price of 3Com shares.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for 3Com, Brian Johnson, said the exact number of Palm shares to be distributed per 3Com share would not be determined until July, because that would be affected by the number of 3Com shares outstanding, which can vary as the company issues or repurchases shares. But he said the company expected the ratio to be about 1.5-to-1.</p>
        <p>Shares of Palm closed yesterday at $32.25, up $1.0625, in Nasdaq trading, while 3Com closed at $43.6875, up 56.25 cents. The announcement of the planned spinoff came after the close of Nasdaq trading.</p>
        <p>If 3Com shareholders do receive 1.5 shares of Palm for each 3Com share, that would provide them with shares worth $48.375 at yesterday's price, $4.6875 more than the price of a 3Com share.</p>
        <p>While 3Com expects to report losses for the remainder of this year as it reorganizes, it has virtually no debt and substantial cash and is clearly worth something. The persistence of the apparently negative value has puzzled market analysts, but while it narrowed sharply in April it never disappeared and began to expand again last week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson, the 3Com spokesman, said the company's board had authorized the company to spend up to $1 billion repurchasing its shares. He said he expected most, if not all, of the share repurchases to be made after the distribution, which will be made July 27 to shareholders of record on July 11.</p>
        <p>Palm, the dominant company in the handheld organizer business, has seen its revenue and profits grow rapidly. Judy Bruner, the company's chief financial officer, said in an interview yesterday that the company expected revenue to continue rising quickly, but that it was possible profits would fall for a few quarters, perhaps to the point of reporting losses, as the company spends money for improved marketing and to expand the uses of its products.</p>
        <p>Palm went public on March 2, at the height of investor enthusiasm for many technology stocks, with 3Com selling a small part of its stake to the public. The offering price of $38 a share was more than twice what the company had planned to seek when it first filed to sell shares. But it was soon eclipsed as the shares traded as high as $165, closing that day at $95.0625. The price of 3Com ended that day at $81.8125.</p>
        <p>In subsequent weeks, the prices of both stocks fell, and by April 12 the Palm price had declined below the offering price. But 3Com's price always remained lower than the value of the Palm shares it owned.</p>
        <p>Several reasons were offered for the persistence of the valuation gap. One was that it was possible that the distribution would not be completed, although most analysts thought the I.R.S. ruling was fairly routine. Another was that many investors did not understand the expected distribution, or were seeking a quick trade in which they would sell Palm before the 3Com distribution was made.</p>
        <p>To take advantage of the gap, an investor theoretically could borrow Palm shares and sell them short while purchasing 3Com shares. Many appear to have done that, and by early last month -- the last date for which figures are available --  more than half the shares in public hands had been sold short. But the shares are difficult to borrow, and anyone doing so ran the risk of possibly having to return the shares before the distribution was completed.</p>
        <p>Now, with a date certain for the distribution, the gap may finally be erased.</p>
