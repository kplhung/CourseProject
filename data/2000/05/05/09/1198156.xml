        <p>For the political leaders crowded into the pews at the front of St. Patrick's Cathedral yesterday, from Democrats like President Clinton to Republicans like Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, it was a difficult moment.</p>
        <p>At the pulpit, Cardinal Bernard Law delivered a homily for Cardinal John O'Connor that included a sharp reminder of one issue on which the cardinal famously sparred with national and New York government leaders. ''What a great legacy he has left us in his constant reminder that the church must always be unambiguously pro-life,'' Cardinal Law declared.</p>
        <p>There was a moment's pause. And then, rising from the pews, came an unbroken roar of applause that lasted for one minute and 50 seconds. Most of the political leaders at the front, almost all of them supporters of legalized abortion, rustled in obvious discomfort as television cameras focused on the moment.</p>
        <p>The mourners applauded as Cardinal Law tried to quiet them with a gesture of his hands. Then they rose to their feet. And with the audience rose the politicians, if not quite as quickly: Gov. George E. Pataki, Mr. Giuliani, Mr. Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Vice President Al Gore, Senator Charles E. Schumer and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan among them. Mr. Giuliani, after tugging at his jacket, even joined in the applause, though unenergetically.</p>
        <p>In politics, the phrase ''pro-life'' is shorthand for opposition to abortion.</p>
        <p>But as Cardinal Law described it, Cardinal O'Connor meant the ''defense of life'' to include much more: opposing capital punishment, euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide, and defending the rights of workers and ''a just peace in the Middle East and in Northern Ireland.''</p>
        <p>But here the political meaning of pro-life seemed to overwhelm the church one.</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush and his father, the former president, applauded. They were among the few politicians in the front pews who share the church's view on abortion. But they vigorously support the death penalty and are not particularly friendly to organized labor, as Cardinal O'Connor was.</p>
        <p>As the applause went on, Mr. Clinton could be seen whispering to Mrs. Clinton, who has moved to New York and is running for the Senate against Mr. Giuliani. They stood in what aides later described as a gesture of respect to the church and the cardinal, though they did not applaud.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's spokeswoman, Sunny Mindel, said the mayor applauded for the same reason. ''This was done out of a show of respect for the cardinal,'' Ms. Mindel said. ''As is known, the mayor is pro-choice.'' Mr. Pataki, who also favors abortion rights, applauded too, ''out of respect for the cardinal and the principles of the Catholic Church,'' said his senior adviser, Zenia Mucha.</p>
        <p>Cardinal Law seemed startled by the display caused by his remark about Cardinal O'Connor's teachings. ''I see he hasn't left the pulpit,'' Cardinal Law said.'</p>
