        <p>The time had come again for St. Patrick's Cathedral to lay one of its own to rest. Deep within its recesses, a crypt awaited the body of Cardinal John O'Connor. But certain rituals needed to unfold first -- the rituals of both a church and a city.</p>
        <p>True, Cardinal O'Connor had requested to be remembered as a simple Roman Catholic priest, but he was still a prince of the church.

        <p>The time had come again for St. Patrick's Cathedral to lay one of its own to rest. Deep within its recesses, a crypt awaited the body of Cardinal John O'Connor. But certain rituals needed to unfold first -- the rituals of both a church and a city.</p>
        <p>True, Cardinal O'Connor had requested to be remembered as a simple Roman Catholic priest, but he was still a prince of the church. True, President Clinton, Vatican emissaries and other dignitaries would need to pay their last respects. But so would those with no bodyguards or colorful vestments, from the schoolboy with the protruding shirttail to the frail woman with a kerchief settled on her hair like a black mist.</p>
        <p>In juggling these many needs yesterday, the 120-year-old cathedral became a majestic setting for the glorious and the sad, the frustrating and the comical. And in doing so, it perhaps provided a fitting last tribute to the cardinal who had worshiped from its altar, railed against injustices from its pulpit, and enjoyed a good laugh within its walls.</p>
        <p>From the moment the muggy air invaded the cathedral's coolness shortly after dawn, it was clear that good intentions would clash with certain realities -- that the echoes of a priest's prayers at the front would compete with the crackle of security radios at the back.</p>
        <p>As the regularly scheduled Masses at 7 and 7:30 proceeded, so too did the steady stream of people, hundreds of them: a man in jogging clothes, another wearing a red ironworkers T-shirt, a woman with a forehead glistening with holy water. They lighted the votive candles in the rows of amber-colored cups, collected their memorial cards bearing a picture of the cardinal, and sat on wooden pews.</p>
        <p>When the service ended, they filed past the cardinal's body, then stopped to sign one of the guest books on their way out. Asked why she had signed her name, Beatrice Carlino, of Flushing, Queens, shrugged and said, ''Just to leave a little bit of myself here.''</p>
        <p>But security concerns -- as well as fears that the procession of hundreds of priests, bishops and cardinals might not begin on time -- soon persuaded church officials to cancel the rest of the morning's Masses and to close the cathedral's doors. Shortly after 8, Chief Allan Hoehl of the Police Department's Manhattan South command tucked a memorial card into his breast pocket and told a subordinate: ''That's it. No more Masses. No more people coming in.''</p>
        <p>When the word spread from the police officers at the barricades to the people waiting outside the cathedral's door -- not far from a church banner proclaiming, ''Open Wide the Doors to Christ'' -- some dropped to their knees and began to pray. Others complained about the commandeering of their church by the powerful.</p>
        <p>''It's understandable -- there are very important people who want to come -- but I don't think it's fair,'' said Madeline Zampella, who had traveled two hours from Brooklyn only to get lost and then blocked from her destination. She had but one conclusion: ''Money talks.''</p>
        <p>Inside the nearly empty cathedral, a church official ordered several ushers to place all the collection baskets in the confessionals and to make sure ''there's no one sleeping'' in the pews. Someone at the altar spoke into the microphone -- ''Testing, testing, one, two'' -- while representatives of an Irish-American organization posed for photographs alongside the cardinal's body.</p>
        <p>Then a head usher led a contingent of pallbearers down the aisle to rehearse the climactic moment of the fast-approaching funeral. At the last pew, he clicked his heels, turned to his right and instructed his followers to pivot sharply around the corner. After a few paces, he clicked his heels again and turned toward the cathedral's crypt. The men who followed seemed daunted by the task before them.</p>
        <p>Dignitaries and guests began to arrive about noon, while crowds of the uninvited pressed against the metal and wooden barricades set up near the cathedral, which faces Fifth Avenue between East 50th and 51st Streets. Some took the sweltering scene in stride; Pamela Montana, of Providence, R.I., distinctive in a red dress and pink feather boa, said she had stopped on her way to the airport to pay her respects. And when the anticipated arrival of President Clinton forced the police to block pedestrian traffic on Madison Avenue, some of the delayed whipped out cell phones to call waiting parties.</p>
        <p>''I can see you,'' a woman in white linen said, gazing up at an office building across the street.</p>
        <p>Others were less gracious. At various entrances to the cathedral, dozens of people explained with increasing anxiety that there must have been some mistake -- they were indeed among the invited. But the security officers -- from the Secret Service, the Police Department and the archdiocese, identifiable by the color of the pins on their lapels -- adhered to the lists in their hands. Two sweet-looking nuns who had managed to glide past the barricades were soon escorted back to the street, albeit with the utmost deference.</p>
        <p>And when a security officer followed the letter of his instructions too closely, an official from the archdiocese rushed over to say that, yes, of course she recognized Bishop John R. McGann, the recently retired leader of the Diocese of Rockville Centre.</p>
        <p>''Sorry,'' the officer mumbled, as the prelate smiled and walked through.</p>
        <p>Across Madison Avenue from the cathedral's rear entrance, the New York Palace Hotel was awash with clerics from around the world. There were monks in the men's room, priests in the dining room, bishops in the lobby. They greeted one another with great affection, made various plans to meet after the funeral, then followed instructions to proceed across the street.</p>
        <p>At 1:20, the solemn procession began to move slowly past the huge bronze doors and up the cathedral's center aisle: cardinals, archbishops, bishops, priests, deacons, seminarians -- so many that those bronze doors did not close until nearly 1:55. By now the cardinal's mahogany coffin at the foot of the altar was closed and draped in a cloth of white to symbolize resurrection.</p>
        <p>The rituals of city and church continued. Outside the cathedral, police officers sweating in blue uniforms stood watch over the people and visitors of New York, so accustomed to paying tribute by standing behind barricades. Inside, a ceremony resounded with the Christian belief in rebirth.</p>
        <p>At the precise moment that a television reporter in the back began to speak into her cell phone, the choir in the loft above sang a full-throated series of amens, as if in remonstration; the woman covered her ear and scurried for quieter ground. Then came the traditional exchanges of peace, which included Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's shaking hands with Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>The Mass ended; it was time to take the coffin to the crypt below. Once again, the head usher led the gray-gloved pallbearers down the center aisle, only this time their burden was real. At the last pew, he clicked his heels, and the procession pivoted to its right.</p>
        <p>A few seconds later he clicked his heels again. The sound echoed. The coffin soon disappeared from view, and members of a city and a church gave their cardinal one last round of applause.</p>
