        <p>After the Devils lost Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals to the Toronto Maple Leafs, a reporter asked Larry Robinson a pointed question and the Devils' coach gave a sharp answer.</p>
        <p>With Patrik Elias, Petr Sykora and Jason Arnott the best New Jersey line that night, why not give them more ice time? Because it could be a long series, Robinson said. We have more depth, he said, and we can use our personnel to wear down the opposition and eventually prevail.</p>
        <p>And so the series unfolded exactly the way Robinson planned. As the Devils eliminated the Leafs last night in Game 6 by a 3-0 score, the Elias-Sykora-Arnott line struck for goals in the first minute of both the first and second periods.</p>
        <p>Their line was once again the best line on the ice, as their sharp shooting, precise passing and crisp checking created low-zone cycles that wearied the Leafs. But Robinson also rolled out his other three lines, all with different styles, and they crashed against the outclassed visitors like so many Atlantic Ocean waves lapping at the Jersey Shore.</p>
        <p>It all made for a festive night in the swampy Meadowlands, with early tailgate picnics in the hot sun and lots of cheering, singing and chanting in the air-conditioned arena. Sort of like one of those Springsteen concerts last summer.</p>
        <p>''Scot-TY! Scot-TY!'' they chanted, when the Devils captain, Scott Stevens, delivered his big, bad checks from the defensive position. The one against Tie Domi in the third period, crashing the Leafs pugilist on his backside, was the image that will define this series.</p>
        <p>''Cu-Jo! Cu-Jo!'' they sang to Curtis Joseph, the beleaguered Toronto goalie.</p>
        <p>Although the Devils' roster is liberally sprinkled with Czechs, Russians and Canadians, the fans played off the contrast of an American team beating a Canadian team.</p>
        <p>''U-S-A!'' they shouted. ''U-S-A!''</p>
        <p>Now, they move to another state to play either Philadelphia or Pittsburgh in the Eastern Conference finals. It is the longest progression for the Devils since they won the Stanley Cup in 1995. With a few days off before the next round, they will be rested and ready for whatever Pennsylvania provides.</p>
        <p>More so than the trapping team that won the championship for Jacques Lemaire, the 2000 Devils are more entertaining, more versatile -- a better blend. They mix nationalities and styles with youth and age. The senior class officers like Stevens, Ken Daneyko, Randy McKay and Bobby Holik are balanced with significant freshmen like Scott Gomez, John Madden, Brian Rafalski and Colin White.</p>
        <p>Gomez, the likely winner of the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year, revived his effort in the final four games of this series. He is figuring out what postseason play is all about.</p>
        <p>''It's do or die,'' Gomez said. ''It's more intense. This is what a lot of guys play for. It's a long road to see what the final prize is. But, if you think about it, it's pretty close.''</p>
        <p>Gomez plays the passer-playmaker role. Another center, Holik, plays the agitator and did it well last night in a single moment that showed the utter frustration of the Leafs. At the end of the second period, he began exchanging rude bumps with Steve Thomas, the Toronto sniper shut out in this round. Push came to shove. Still, no penalty.</p>
        <p>Finally, Thomas swung his stick near Holik's head. Penalty, two minutes for high-sticking. In disgust, Thomas then shot the puck into the corner as the Devils fans cheered over the sound of the final buzzer of the period.</p>
        <p>''The sky is the limit,'' Holik said. ''These 20 guys are the key. Everybody knows their role.'' Shifting to an American baseball expression, Holik said: ''How they say? Nice guys finish last.''</p>
        <p>But how can an evaluation of this Devils team ignore the contribution of Martin Brodeur, the star goalie? Perhaps because the Leafs managed an astonishingly low total of only six shots for the entire game. Some teams get that in a single minute. Toward the end, the fans cheered robustly when Brodeur cleared the puck the length of the ice for a shot at Joseph.</p>
        <p>Surely, the Flyers and the Penguins will launch a better attack.</p>
        <p>''I'm sure; I hope so,'' Brodeur said. ''I'm going to have a heart attack if I keep facing six shots a game. It's tough.'' But it wasn't so tough to look ahead to the next round.</p>
        <p>''I'm really excited to get another shot at a conference final,'' Brodeur said. ''This is a great moment for this franchise.''</p>
