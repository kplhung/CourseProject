        <p>It was time today for the Knicks to take their medicine for losing Game 1 to the Heat, several doses of an over-the-airways prescription known as the classic second guess.

        <p>It was time today for the Knicks to take their medicine for losing Game 1 to the Heat, several doses of an over-the-airways prescription known as the classic second guess. Much of it was administered by reporters. Some of it was self-applied. All of it indicated that the Knicks' playoff honeymoon concluded 9 days ago not far from Niagara Falls, and they have come back to their customary state of crankiness and doubt.</p>
        <p>Such lousy front-runners these Knicks are, which probably means they'll be ready and raring to go in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference semifinals Tuesday night at American Airlines Arena, where the only missing component today was a pack of protesters shouting, ''Free Marcus Camby.''</p>
        <p>Inside the arena on a balmy afternoon, Coach Jeff Van Gundy was chafing at having to explain why he sat his high-octane octopus in the final 3 minutes 35 seconds of Sunday's 87-83 defeat, after Camby grabbed 13 rebounds in just 27 minutes. Did Van Gundy go too long with Larry Johnson or Patrick Ewing? Should he have pulled his point guard, and gone with Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell in the backcourt?</p>
        <p>Van Gundy's answer, delivered from the pulpit of rhetorical high ground, was that he went with the same lineup that was 3-for-3 down the stretch in the Toronto series. How come no one questioned his deployment then?</p>
        <p>''When it doesn't work out, you made the wrong decisions,'' the coach, his lip in half-smirk, said before he went on to do a little second-guessing himself, of his players' passivity in defending the basket.</p>
        <p>It is true that it was much easier for the pro-Camby reform movement to fire up with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight that Johnson missed the open 3-ball this time and Ewing was dominated by Alonzo Mourning and the Knicks could have used a double shot of adrenaline and athleticism, of sugar-coated Camby. No big deal, Camby pretended, relaxing his long limbs as he sat on a table along the sideline. ''It has nothing to do with age and size,'' he said. ''This is how we played most of our games at the end, with old guys, short guys, whatever.''</p>
        <p>The old guy, Ewing, was moving by game's end with the grace of a glacier. The short guy, Johnson, was not about to produce the game-altering energy or put-back basket the Knicks clearly needed as they were misfiring on their last eight shots. Throw in Sprewell's being outweighed by 50 pounds by Jamal Mashburn and what you have is a Knicks starting and finishing front line that had better start spiking its spinach.</p>
        <p>The second-guessing was a bit overstated, given that the Knicks were several times one shot away from winning Game 1. On the other hand, they have now lost four of five against the Heat this season, and if they lose again Tuesday night, expect three days in New York of full-court panic. Van Gundy, for his part, should already have forgotten what worked against Toronto, whose frontcourt players were as rooted to the floor as New York's. If the Knicks and the Heat go down the stretch again Tuesday night, he's got to start remembering his team's most significant hour last spring, Game 5 of the six-game takeout of the Pacers in Indianapolis in the conference finals.</p>
        <p>It was Camby who appeared from nowhere, changed shot patterns, controlled the air space above the rim, spread his wingspan and jetted the Knicks into the finals. He is the one Knick who has the potential on any night to soar above the common Knicks-Heat playoff scrum, but the coach apparently still has issues with commitment to a whimsical player who has little conventional offense.</p>
        <p>''I thought Larry played well,'' Van Gundy said. ''I don't know who else you take out.''</p>
        <p>This is no democracy, and Sprewell said he has no idea what Van Gundy is planning, but he had no qualms about voting for the point guard to sit in certain situations. This way, Sprewell reasoned, Camby could get more minutes, and the Knicks could make the injured Tim Hardaway guard him or Houston.</p>
        <p>''That's like smelling blood,'' Sprewell said. ''He's out there, hobbling around, and I would definitely do something to make him pay.''</p>
        <p>Though last season is already part of a century past, the friendship of Sprewell and Camby was, in part, a product of the way they, as newcomers, were used by Van Gundy. They still often serve as a window into each other's feelings, and Sprewell left no doubt that Camby was discouraged by not getting the chance to affect Sunday's endgame.</p>
        <p>''Sure, I know he is,'' Sprewell said. ''I thought he should be in the game. We talked about it, but that's a coach's decision and Marcus isn't the type at this point to pout.''</p>
        <p>Who has time? After three playoff games in 17 days, it is a pleasure to have Game 2 come up before we have barely digested Game 1. With regard to a continuum and competition and context, this finally feels like the playoffs.</p>
