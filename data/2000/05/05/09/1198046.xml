        <p>Thirty years ago, obstetricians listened for the reassuring sound of a fetal heartbeat and felt a woman's abdomen to monitor fetal growth and position. It was, in essence, educated guesswork, trying to visualize the unborn baby without ever really seeing it.</p>
        <p>In the late 1970's, obstetricians started to see it all. New kinds of ultrasound machines revolutionized prenatal monitoring. For the first time, physicians, mothers and fathers could look at the fetus's beating heart and squiggling hands and feet. Expectant parents left the doctor's office with goodie bags, envelopes filled with early baby photos.</p>
        <p>Along the way, ultrasound has grown up. Rather than simply glancing at the fetus, doctors today take a series of measurements: the length of the fetus; the length of the thigh bone; and the circumferences of the head and abdomen. They check the four chambers of the heart and the structures of the kidney and bladder.</p>
        <p>And now ultrasound is on the verge of yet another revolution. The latest gadgets, though far from standard use, create three-dimensional images of the fetus and may be used to peer deep within the fetal brain, identifying fine points of the developing anatomy never seen before. Another type of ultrasound, Doppler, is being used to monitor blood flow of fetal organs, helping doctors check not just structure, but function of organs.</p>
        <p>And yet another new ultrasound technique, one that measures the fluid in a fetus's neck, is now being studied. Many experts think it, when combined with analyses of blood tests and maternal age, might eventually reduce the number of screenings by amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling, two definitive yet slightly risky procedures, in detecting birth defects.</p>
        <p>''With any new technology there are growing pains, but once we overcome them we will see that the uses of ultrasound will grow exponentially,'' said Dr. John Hobbins, director of obstetrics at the University of Colorado Health Science Center in Denver. ''Soon we will be using ultrasound to assess normality, not just identify abnormalities. These new technologies are allowing us to see the whole deal -- what the baby looks like, how it is behaving, and how the organs are functioning.''</p>
        <p>But as ultrasound has grown up and come to rival amniocentesis, it is raising new questions about how much information expectant parents really want, and whether all those using ultrasound really know what the new images mean.</p>
        <p>One of the latest findings is a bright spot on the heart that has been tied to an increased risk of Down syndrome, Dr. Hobbins said.</p>
        <p>The problem is that ''if you use a high-frequency transducer, with a little imagination you can find a bright spot in every fetal heart,'' Dr. Hobbins said. ''So what do you tell a patient? I tell patients that I've seen a bright spot and we are not sure what it means, though some studies have shown an association to Down syndrome.''</p>
        <p>An article in January in The Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine highlights the angst that the new technology can bring: ''From my vantage point, the identification of these 'abnormalities' in low-risk women has crossed the line of 'more harm than good,' '' wrote Dr. Roy Filly, professor of radiology at the University of California at San Francisco School of Medicine. ''We put at least 10 percent of all pregnant women with perfectly normal fetuses through a great deal of worry,'' he concluded in his essay, ''Obstetrical Sonography: The Best Way to Terrify a Pregnant Woman.''</p>
        <p>In the first trimester, the ultrasound scan is now typically used to determine fetal age by measuring crown-rump (head to bottom) length and head circumference. In the second trimester, doctors measure abdominal circumference, and check the chambers of the heart, the kidneys and bladder to spot defects and monitor growth.</p>
        <p>Another standard measurement is femur, or thigh bone, length. Between 17 and 19 weeks of gestation, an abnormally short femur may suggest Down syndrome, said Dr. Lawrence Platt, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>But ultrasound is already moving beyond such measurements. One, now being tested in two trials in the United States, is performed between the 10th and 13th weeks of pregnancy and, when combined with blood tests and assessment of the mother's age, is aimed at determining a woman's odds of having a baby with Down syndrome.</p>
        <p>The new technique measures a fluid-filled area behind the neck, known as nuchal translucency.</p>
        <p>Fetuses with birth defects often have extra fluid in this area between the 10th and 14th weeks of gestation, said Dr. Kypros Nicolaides, a professor of fetal medicine at Kings College Hospital in London, who developed the new method.</p>
        <p>The blood test measures two hormones: beta-HCG (the same substance measured in pregnancy tests) and PAPP-A, or pregnancy-associated placental protein. For still unknown reasons, abnormally high levels of HCG and low levels of PAPP-A in the first trimester have been linked to Down syndrome. Already a British study of 120,000 women found the method was 85 percent accurate.</p>
        <p>Such tests are still quite different from diagnostic tests like amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling (C.V.S.) -- in which a sample of fetal cells is examined with a microscope and offer definitive answers. But roughly one woman in every 200 to 300 miscarries after amniocentesis. The risk is slightly higher for C.V.S.</p>
        <p>Sara Leyden, a 38-year-old mother of two from Philadelphia, for one, was determined to avoid amniocentesis in her second pregnancy. In her first pregnancy, a blood test falsely suggested a birth defect so her doctors recommended amniocentesis, which found the fetus to be normal. This time she elected to participate in one of the trials evaluating the new first-trimester ultrasound test. She knew the test would not yield conclusive information but hedged her bets that the results would be more accurate than the blood test she had had before.</p>
        <p>''The procedure was painless,'' Mrs. Leyden said, referring to the ultrasound. ''It was wonderful to see the baby at 14 weeks. I knew there were no definitive answers, but every indication showed the baby was fine.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Leyden said her own mother feels fortunate she gave birth in the days before the information explosion because, she told her daughter,  ''it's driving you girls crazy.''</p>
        <p>Even if studies prove the first-trimester ultrasound test is effective, many women may still decide to go right to amniocentesis or C.V.S. ''It's an individual and personal decision that patients will have to decide for themselves,'' said Dr. Michael Mennuti, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Pennsylvania Health System in Philadelphia. ''For some women the anxiety of possibly getting a 'high risk' result and then having amniocentesis is not worth it. They would rather go directly for the invasive, definitive test. For other women the reassuring information of a screening test is good enough and they are happy to avoid the definitive test because of the low risk of miscarriage.''</p>
        <p>Sandra Socza, a 36-year-old television producer in Los Angeles, was one who jumped at the chance to participate in the screening trial. ''The last thing I wanted was amniocentesis. I didn't want to be one of the statistics when the test didn't work out, plus a needle going through your abdomen seemed so intrusive,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Researchers say the screening test, if it is proved effective, may pinpoint young women at risk who would never have considered amniocentesis. About 80 percent of Down syndrome babies are born to women younger than 35. That is because even though the individual risk is lower, the vast majority of babies, healthy and unhealthy, are born to younger women.</p>
        <p>''I think there are some women who are intimidated by the choices and find it confusing,'' said Dr. Ronald Wapner, the director of maternal fetal medicine and of reproductive genetics at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, and a researcher in one of the trials.</p>
        <p>''But a lot of women are very happy to have choices and take control over their pregnancy,'' he said. ''They are difficult decisions. But the most important thing to remember is that no matter how a woman decides, most likely everything will be fine. The odds are in her favor.''</p>
