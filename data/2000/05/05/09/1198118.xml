        <p>One shoe was off, temporarily easing the discomfort in Tim Hardaway's sprained left foot after the Miami Heat's 90-minute practice today. The pressure on Hardaway, though, is expected to be more intense on Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>Like a boxer targeting an opponent's bleeding wound, Hardaway believes the Knicks will force him to defend more often against penetration by the point guards in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference semifinals.</p>
        <p>Hardaway almost rolled over on his ankle trying to defend the Knicks' Charlie Ward, who blew by him on a nifty fake and crossover move in the third quarter of Game 1 on Sunday. Hardaway left the court immediately and missed seven minutes while having his ankle retaped in the locker room.</p>
        <p>''They'll put the ball on the floor and drive more to see if I'm able to stay with it,'' Hardaway said. ''I'd do the same thing.''</p>
        <p>Hardaway, who said he was 80 to 85 percent, had 6 points, 7 assists and 1 rebound in 30 minutes in Game 1. In four regular-season meetings against the Knicks, he averaged 15.3 points, 7.8 assists, 3.8 rebounds and 37.5 minutes.</p>
        <p>''They don't need to make any adjustments against me,'' Hardaway said. ''I really didn't do anything. Hopefully, I'll be able to play the same minutes I did Sunday and make a few more shots. Mostly, I just want to be out there and be aggressive and lead my team. I know I won't be able to do certain moves. But I know I'm helping because I'm still a threat out there.''</p>
        <p>Hardaway's presence kept the Knicks' attention on the perimeter and away from double-teaming Alonzo Mourning down low. Defensively, Hardaway will be a liability if either Chris Childs or Ward exploits his injured foot.</p>
        <p>''One leg or arm, I still want him out there,'' Mourning said. ''He still has a huge effect on our play.''</p>
        <p>Riley's Viewpoint</p>
        <p>After spending 90 minutes reviewing videotapes of Game 1, Heat Coach Pat Riley offered the same analysis he did Sunday: the Heat's defense was strong, but the Knicks, particularly Larry Johnson (4 of 9) and Latrell Sprewell (4 of 12), did not shoot well in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>Johnson scored 6 of his 8 points in the first four minutes, but disappeared in the fourth, missing the one shot he took -- an open 24-footer -- with 1 minute 11 seconds left.</p>
        <p>Sprewell sank two free throws in the final minute, but clanked his only two field-goal attempts. Neither player seemed in sync with the offense down the stretch.</p>
        <p>''The major adjustment we've got to make is in some certain situations where they had open shots and just didn't make them,'' Riley said. ''We can't expect that to happen again. Even though we won, it was still very unclear. We can't sit idly by and think we caused them to miss those shots.''</p>
        <p>Riley also seemed more concerned about containing Sprewell, Johnson and Allan Houston than he did about stopping Patrick Ewing, who had 17 points and 9 rebounds.</p>
        <p>''He looked a little stiff when he fell down a few times,'' Riley said. ''But he had a good game.''</p>
        <p>Riley also pointed to turnovers and the Heat's shot selection in the fourth quarter. ''We only took three or four bad shots and had zero turnovers,'' Riley said. ''For us, that's rare. We took care of the ball when it mattered most.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks had one fewer turnover than the Heat (13-12), but committed five turnovers in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>The Camby Factor</p>
        <p>The Heat's P. J. Brown wondered why the Knicks did not play Marcus Camby as much as -- or more than -- Larry Johnson in Game 1. In 27 minutes, Camby scored 11 points on 4-of-5 shooting and grabbed 13 rebounds. In 39 minutes, Johnson had 8 points and 6 rebounds.</p>
        <p>''It's a different story if they play Camby more,'' Brown said. ''It means a lot more work for me. If you can get a body on him and hurt his activeness, you can contain him. But it's not that easy.''</p>
