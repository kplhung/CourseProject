        <p>For years, it has seemed almost axiomatic: to know if someone has high blood pressure, just look at the figure for the patient's diastolic pressure (the ''80,'' for example, in 120/80). The upper, or systolic, figure, was practically ignored.</p>
        <p>But federal health officials said last week that this belief, common among many doctors, is wrong -- dangerously so, in many cases.

        <p>For years, it has seemed almost axiomatic: to know if someone has high blood pressure, just look at the figure for the patient's diastolic pressure (the ''80,'' for example, in 120/80). The upper, or systolic, figure, was practically ignored.</p>
        <p>But federal health officials said last week that this belief, common among many doctors, is wrong -- dangerously so, in many cases. Systolic blood pressure, health officials said, is a reliable general sign of hypertension and as people get to middle age and beyond, it is the best reliable indicator.</p>
        <p>The National Institutes of Health have issued a formal clinical advisory to doctors suggesting that they focus on systolic pressure in older adults. And it plans to conduct a broad public education campaign.</p>
        <p>In 1997, the health institutes issued guidelines recommending that both systolic and diastolic blood pressure be used to diagnose hypertension in patients of all ages. But since then, federal officials said, studies have shown that the key figure for patients who are middle-aged or older is the systolic figure.</p>
        <p>Significant evidence of the value of systolic pressure, for example, came from recent results in the Framingham Heart Study, which has followed the health of thousands of people in the Boston area for 50 years. Still, Dr. Daniel Levy, director of the Framingham study, said in an interview that there had been no single finding that changed medical thinking about how to diagnose high blood pressure, but rather a growing body of evidence that in the end seemed incontrovertible.</p>
        <p>''Systolic hypertension is a major health threat, especially for older Americans,'' Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, said in announcing the clinical advisory.</p>
        <p>The new guidelines recommend that blood pressure for people of all ages be kept below 140/90 (130/85 for hypertensives with diabetes, and as low as possible for people with heart of kidney failure).</p>
