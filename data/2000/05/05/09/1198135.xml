        <p>After a bill-signing ceremony at the White House a few weeks ago, President Clinton pulled aside an unlikely ally in his fight to win approval for a decisive trade measure with China, the administration's top foreign policy goal.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>After a bill-signing ceremony at the White House a few weeks ago, President Clinton pulled aside an unlikely ally in his fight to win approval for a decisive trade measure with China, the administration's top foreign policy goal.</p>
        <p>''We talked about what each of us has to do and we gave each other some advice,'' said Representative Tom DeLay of Texas, the House majority whip and perhaps Mr. Clinton's most venomous critic on Capitol Hill, who refused to divulge details of the private chat in his rare visit to the Oval Office.</p>
        <p>With the vote just two weeks away, Mr. DeLay, who led the charge to impeach Mr. Clinton, now finds himself in the improbable role of the president's chief water-carrier in an all-out battle to grant China permanent normal trading privileges.</p>
        <p>If the China measure succeeds, and right now the vote is too close to call, it will be largely with the support of Republicans, who are expected to deliver about 150 of the 218 votes needed to pass it. The measure would allow American companies to benefit fully from a market-opening accord that paves the way for China to enter the World Trade Organization. Approval by the Senate appears more certain.</p>
        <p>That's why Mr. Clinton needs Mr. DeLay, who as the chief Republican vote-counter brings the power of his vaunted House whip operation as well as his own widely acclaimed -- and feared -- brass-knuckle tactics that have earned him the nickname ''The Hammer.'' (''If we get within four or five votes, we can break some arms on the floor,'' said one of Mr. DeLay's advisers.)</p>
        <p>Mr. DeLay insists that his personal distaste for Mr. Clinton, whom he criticized recently as ''lacking the necessary moral authority to protect U.S. interests in the world,'' is not clouding his professional task at hand: rounding up votes.</p>
        <p>''I have a fundamental disagreement with this president about how he's done his job, but when he's doing something I think is important I'm going to support him because he doesn't do it very often,'' Mr. DeLay said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeLay has even gone out of his way to praise the president's efforts to rally support for the measure. Mr. DeLay's chief of staff, Susan B. Hirschmann, consults regularly with the chief White House lobbyist, Charles M. Brain.</p>
        <p>''They've done a good job, and the president's done a very good job,'' Mr. DeLay said. ''He's done exactly what a president should do in getting his points across.''</p>
        <p>Administration officials say they are pleased, and relieved, that the bitter rivalry has turned to temporary truce. ''Even though it may seem a little strange, based on other battles we've had, there have been a few flurries of bipartisanship in seven years,'' Commerce Secretary William Daley said today.</p>
        <p>The Clinton-DeLay connection is just one of the odd alignments spawned from the fight, which has labor unions and conservative religious groups opposing the measure and soybean farmers and high-tech executives backing it.</p>
        <p>Support for the measure grew today. The Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, publicly endorsed it. Three former presidents, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter and George Bush, issued a letter coordinated by the White House warning that defeat ''would be read in China as a vote for confrontation and as an argument for hunkering down, instead of continuing to reach out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's son, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, also supports the measure, but according to aides has not discussed it with Mr. DeLay. So does Vice President Al Gore, although he gave somewhat mixed signals earlier in the year.</p>
        <p>Some colleagues say Mr. DeLay is singing the White House's praises through clenched teeth, and is consoling himself that helping to hand Mr. Clinton a crowning legislative triumph will cheer the pro-Republican business community and undermine the Chinese Communists.</p>
        <p>If it is strange to see Mr. DeLay and Mr. Clinton teaming up, it is equally strange for Mr. Delay to support a measure that China passionately wants. Mr. DeLay, a fierce anti-Communist, is the chief author of the proposed Taiwan Security Enhancement Act, a bill the House passed this year to strengthen military ties between Taiwan and the Pentagon, which Beijing strongly opposes.</p>
        <p>Then there was Mr. DeLay's encounter last spring with China's ambassador, Li Zhao Xing, offstage at the NBC News program ''Meet the Press.''</p>
        <p>''I told him: 'Don't take the weakness of this American president as the weakness of the American people,' '' Mr. DeLay recounted recently to a group of Washington Post reporters and editors. ''He looked at me kind of funny, so I pulled him real close, nose to nose, and I repeated it, very slowly. He just turned and kind of walked off.''</p>
        <p>Outside the studio, Mr. DeLay said the ambassador stopped criticizing the United States and ''scooted off'' when the lawmaker walked up. ''It shows you that if you stand up to a bully, then you control the bully,'' Mr. DeLay said. ''If you kowtow to the bully, the bully will run your life forever. And that's the way I see these people.''</p>
        <p>A Chinese Embassy official said the ambassador had no idea who Mr. DeLay was, and until he read about the incident, thought he had been accosted by an ordinary American.  The two men met later to discuss the trade bill, and there were ''no hard feelings,'' the embassy aide said.</p>
        <p>So why does so fierce a critic of Beijing support the trade measure?  ''Exporting American values undermines the Communist regime in China,'' Mr. DeLay explained in the interview. ''I see it as a beginning of the end of Communism.''</p>
        <p>Mr. DeLay said he also distinguishes the Beijing government from ordinary Chinese people. ''They have tasted the sweet taste of freedom and they're not going to give it back,'' Mr. DeLay said in a speech last week.</p>
        <p>But corporate lobbyists have always viewed Mr. DeLay's commitment to trade with China with some suspicion. In a speech on March 16, Mr. DeLay underscored his support for normalizing trade relations with China, but he also warned that the status might be revoked if trade ever strengthened the Beijing government rather than weakened it.</p>
        <p>''We should never be fooled into cheering higher profits while Communist China harnesses that prosperity to construct an arsenal of tyranny,'' Mr. DeLay said.</p>
        <p>Which is why many business lobbyists who have met Mr. DeLay recently have been struck by his fervor. ''This man sounded like a true believer,'' said one leading lobbyist.  ''He talked about kicking butt.''</p>
