        <p>On April 28, a California man who uses the Internet name ''golfpoorly'' put a half-dozen items up for sale on eBay, the online auction company. Along with an unopened roll of twine, a never-inflated basketball, a Mexican voodoo mask, a Netgear network card and a pewter frame, he offered a ''great big wild abstract art painting'' that he said was bought years ago at a garage sale in Berkeley and had a small hole inflicted by a son wielding a plastic tricycle.</p>

        <p>On April 28, a California man who uses the Internet name ''golfpoorly'' put a half-dozen items up for sale on eBay, the online auction company. Along with an unopened roll of twine, a never-inflated basketball, a Mexican voodoo mask, a Netgear network card and a pewter frame, he offered a ''great big wild abstract art painting'' that he said was bought years ago at a garage sale in Berkeley and had a small hole inflicted by a son wielding a plastic tricycle.</p>
        <p>The opening bid for each of the items was a quarter.</p>
        <p>By yesterday evening, after 95 offers, bidding for the painting -- which on a computer screen looks vaguely like a landscape swathed in red, orange and a pinkish accent -- had soared to $135,805. When the auction closed at 9:49 p.m. Eastern time, a man named Rob Keereweer in the Netherlands was the high bidder.</p>
        <p>The unusual run-up was fueled by speculation that the painting might be a 1952 work by Richard Diebenkorn, the California painter known for his sublime use of color in abstract and representational works.</p>
        <p>The six-figure sale is not only one of the highest prices paid online for art, it is also a powerful testimony to the ability of the Internet to ignite a sales frenzy, even for expensive items that may or may not be what people think they are.</p>
        <p>''I'm still astonished that anyone would pay that much for something they hadn't seen,'' said John Elderfield, the chief curator at the Museum of Modern Art and an expert on Diebenkorn. A real painting by Diebenkorn, who died in 1993, could be worth millions. The record price at auction was set in 1998, when his 1959 painting ''Horizon: Ocean Park'' sold at Sotheby's for $3.9 million.</p>
        <p>But eBay does not vouch for the authenticity of anything people sell on its site. It considers the deals to be private transactions. And for now at least no one knows for sure whether the ''golfpoorly'' painting is by Diebenkorn or not.</p>
        <p>''The palette is right, and the signature is right on,'' said Will Ameringer, a New York dealer who has sold work by Diebenkorn. ''It's either a good fake or the real thing.'' Other experts agreed, but they and Mr. Ameringer said they could not give definitive opinions about its authenticity without seeing the painting.</p>
        <p>Which is impossible.</p>
        <p>Michael Kaiser, a private art dealer in Medford, Ore., bid the painting up to $128,600 on Sunday but then changed his mind. He said he withdrew his offer after the seller, who Mr. Kaiser said was a lawyer who lived in the Sacramento area, refused to let him see the painting. ''It made me suspicious when he would not let me see it when I'm making the effort to drive five hours down there,'' said Mr. Kaiser, who added that he ''buys a lot of art online.''</p>
        <p>''Golfpoorly,'' responding to an e-mail message, declined to comment, citing the advice of his lawyer, the possibility of theft and tax consequences. He signed the message, ''Ken.'' The name associated with the e-mail address is K. A. Walton, and a phone message left at the home of Kenneth Walton in Sacramento was not returned. That left open several questions, such as why he did not withdraw the painting once people began attributing it to Diebenkorn in favor of selling it through the established art market, where it might attract a much higher price.</p>
        <p>But ''golfpoorly'' told his story of the painting online when he put it up for sale. He bought it, he said, before he married. ''My wife has never let me keep it in the house,'' he explained, so -- though he ''always kind of liked it'' -- he decided to sell.</p>
        <p>''Golfpoorly'' said the painting was 2 feet 11 inches by 3 feet 11 inches, and noted that the hole was about an inch and a quarter long and ''would be easy to fix with duct tape.''</p>
        <p>He never said it was a Diebenkorn, but along with a picture of the entire painting -- incorrectly oriented vertically, which he noted in his posting -- he placed a closeup of the hole. The signature, ''R.D. '52,'' was easily discernable in the closeup, and it stirred up the interest and skepticism as well.</p>
        <p>In the early 1950's, Diebenkorn made a series of abstract works in successive locations for which the cycles are named -- Albuquerque; Urbana, Ill.; and Berkeley, Calif. The Berkeley series began around 1953, so an unknown 1952 work would not be unreasonable. The colors in the ''golfpoorly'' painting match those Diebenkorn used in his Berkeley series.</p>
        <p>A Berkeley painting from 1955 sold for $1.8 million at Sotheby's in May 1998, and others have sold privately for about $1 million, dealers said.</p>
        <p>''Golfpoorly'' said he was surprised by the fuss. On Sunday, he added to the eBay posting, apologized for not answering inquiries,  and said, ''We're freaked out by all of this, and because of the high price this painting is going for (WOW!!!!) I contacted an attorney.''</p>
        <p>On the lawyer's advice, he said, he added the following online: ''This painting is sold in the same manner as the other items I am selling on eBay, and requires full payment within 7 days of the auction, in advance of delivery to the buyer, and is sold as described in the auction description, without representation as to authorship or authenticity.''</p>
        <p>''Golfpoorly'' registered with eBay last summer and has sold items on eBay a couple of times before. Those who have bought from him give him good reviews. On his eBay ID card, 13 people did so, while none rated him negatively. ''Charged me less for shipping than he quoted,'' wrote one who uses the name ''cheesesix.'' ''A really nice guy.'' Another buyer, a self-employed, self-described computer geek in Los Angeles who claimed to buy online all the time, said the espresso machine he bought from ''golfpoorly'' for about $280 was ''very good and honestly described.''</p>
        <p>Such testimonials undoubtedly enhance ''golfpoorly's'' credibility, but they are hardly relevant to whether this painting is an authentic Diebenkorn worth six fugures.</p>
        <p>As online auctions have gathered force in the last few years, numerous sites have begun to offer art. Those related to the art world usually have some standards. Artnet.com, for example, says that ''All lots have been vetted by reputable dealers and compared with existing auction results,'' while Sotheby's guarantees the authenticity of works it sells online.</p>
        <p>There seems to be no definitive records of online art sales, but according to Art and Auction magazine, the highest price on an art site transaction was $168,000 for a 1959 watercolor by Lucio Fontana, which sold on artnet.com in 1999.</p>
        <p>EBay does not keep track of transactions, either -- there were more than 53 million listings in the last quarter alone, a spokesman said -- but it believes that a Picasso sold for just under $2 million last year.</p>
        <p>And sites like eBay are truly ''buyer beware'' locations, a fact acknowledged by the man who bid $135,805 for the ''golfpoorly'' offering. Declining to speak at length from the Netherlands, where he lives, he wrote via e-mail, ''I myself would like to concentrate on the auction right now, the final moment of the auction is in the middle of the night for me and I need time to explain to my wife why I am bidding so much money on a painting that I have not seen in the flesh.''</p>
        <p>As for ''golfpoorly,'' his other five auction items fetched a total of $43.75.</p>
