        <p>THE ISSUES</p>
        <p>CUOMO SEEKS BUSH STAND ON GUN BILL  Housing Secretary Andrew Cuomo added his voice yesterday to the chorus of Democrats who have called on Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to clarify his position on federal legislation that would prohibit lawsuits by local governments against gun manufacturers. Mr. Bush signed such legislation in Texas, and suggested last week that he would do the same in Washington. In a telephone news conference yesterday, Mr. Cuomo, who has tried to negotiate settlements between gun makers and cities that have sued them, called Mr. Bush's remarks vague. He asserted that the gun makers, who have broken off talks in recent months, would return to the table if they knew Mr. Bush opposed such legislation. Bush aides accused Mr. Cuomo of politicizing the issue. ''Instead of spending their time distorting and misrepresenting Governor Bush's priorities, the Clinton-Gore administration ought to spend more time enforcing our existing gun laws,'' said Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Mr. Bush.</p>

        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>ABORTION LOOMS AS PLATFORM ISSUE  Various interests groups, especially those that support abortion rights, plan to have their voices heard when the Republican national convention this summer in Philadelphia assembles a platform for this year's nominee. Over the weekend, Gov. Tommy G. Thompson of Wisconsin, the recently selected chairman of the platform committee, offered them some thoughts. After all the hearings are held and all the testimony is heard, he said, the presidential candidate will have the last word, not the committee. ''I'm certainly going to be listening to all sectors of the party,'' Mr. Thompson told The Philadelphia Inquirer. ''But my ultimate client is George Bush, and what he feels best is what we will do.'' On the matter of abortion, Mr. Thompson said he would abide by Mr. Bush's promises to leave the current plank, which strongly opposes abortion.</p>

        <p>THE LIBERTARIANS</p>
        <p>ELECTION COMMISSION SUED  The Libertarian Party sued the Federal Election Commission yesterday, contending that rules for participation in presidential debates are so restrictive that they unfairly exclude minor-party candidates and independents. The lawsuit, the culmination of a long series of complaints about debate regulations, argues that it is nearly impossible for less well-known and less well-financed candidates to participate because candidates who do not draw at least 15 percent in voter polls are automatically excluded. In the suit, filed in federal court in Manhattan, the Libertarians, joined by several other plaintiffs, asserted that ''there is a common interest of the Democratic and Republican Parties, implemented in part through organizations such as the Commission on Presidential Debates, to lessen the stature and legitimacy of independent and minor-party candidates.'' The commission, a nonprofit group, has run the debates since 1987. The suit also asserts that the debates violate federal law because money contributed to finance them is meant to enhance voter participation, not to support any particular party or candidate. A commission spokesman, John Scardino, said the debate qualification standards were fair and entirely legal.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>RIFT GROWS AMONG ARIZONA REPUBLICANS  It is no secret among Arizona Republicans that Gov. Jane Dee Hull's endorsement of her fellow governor George W. Bush over her fellow Arizonan Senator John McCain left bad feelings on both sides. It was bad enough that last month Ms. Hull agreed to give up the governor's prerogative of leading the state's delegation to the Republican National Convention -- after all, Mr. McCain easily won the primary, and thus the right to control the state's 30-member delegation. Now comes word that Mr. McCain wants his wife, Cindy, to lead the delegation instead. That has rankled Hull supporters. The issue is to be decided at the state party convention on Saturday.</p>
