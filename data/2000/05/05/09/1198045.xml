        <p>As Mrs. Malaprop is moved to advise at one point, ''One should not anticipate the past,'' and the Acting Company is very much grounded in the present penchant for buffoonery as it turns its revival of Sheridan's 1775 comedy ''The Rivals'' into a pleasant little romp, even if it occasionally sacrifices some of the play's subtleties in favor of the broader humor.</p>
        <p>To quote again from that indomitable doyenne of Bath society, there is ''no honor before ladies,'' and the ''men are all Bavarians'' in this staging of a lighthearted confection that blends a comedy of 18th-century manners with a touch of farce and even some Restoration ribaldry. But the heart of this lampoon of sentimental romance and middle-class society is a verbal wit that still sparkles two centuries later.</p>

        <p>As Mrs. Malaprop is moved to advise at one point, ''One should not anticipate the past,'' and the Acting Company is very much grounded in the present penchant for buffoonery as it turns its revival of Sheridan's 1775 comedy ''The Rivals'' into a pleasant little romp, even if it occasionally sacrifices some of the play's subtleties in favor of the broader humor.</p>
        <p>To quote again from that indomitable doyenne of Bath society, there is ''no honor before ladies,'' and the ''men are all Bavarians'' in this staging of a lighthearted confection that blends a comedy of 18th-century manners with a touch of farce and even some Restoration ribaldry. But the heart of this lampoon of sentimental romance and middle-class society is a verbal wit that still sparkles two centuries later.</p>
        <p>The drollery of Sheridan's language is present in the Acting Company staging for those quick enough to catch it, but under Nicholas Martin's direction the emphasis here is on grabbing a laugh by any means available. With the help of some bright, outlandish costumes by Michael Krass that only a Malvolio could find fashionable, Mr. Martin has mounted a lively revival that exaggerates the foibles of the characters.</p>
        <p>The action evolves around two sets of lovers in a plot complicated by mistaken identities, misdirected billets-doux, misguided wooings by not one but two country bumpkins and the meddling of relatives, one of whom is one of the English-speaking theater's funniest creations: Mrs. Malaprop.</p>
        <p>After touring with ''The Rivals'' since last fall (in tandem with Shakespeare's Scottish play), the able cast works well as an ensemble even if some performances are more fully realized than others.</p>
        <p>Angela Pierce is flighty and impetuous as Lydia Languish, the beloved of Captain Absolute (a k a Ensign Beverly), who is given a dashing if somewhat bland performance by Matt Anderson. Erik Steele delivers a fine deadpan reading of Faulkland as he finds new ways to keep the flame of suspicion burning over Julia, who is credibly played by Mia Barron.</p>
        <p>But it is the people in crowd around these two couples who provide much of the play's humor, and chief among them in Jonathan Uffelman as Bob Acres, the squire from Devonshire who has come up to Bath from the country to pursue the beautiful Lydia. From his first entrance Mr. Uffelman brightens the stage, and he makes a splendid clown when he returns later dressed as a dandy with a mop of bright red hair standing straight up as though he had been struck by lightning. And Royden Mills delivers a delightful small turn as David, Acres's servant (especially in an inspired piece of business of sniffing a wine cork).</p>
        <p>Michelle Tauber plays Mrs. Malaprop as if she were an 18th-century Drew Carey. With a yard-tall head of hair that looks like cotton candy, Ms. Tauber offers a cartoon version of Mrs. Malaprop: sputtering, fuming, fawning and frequently underlining with gesture and voice the famous misuses of language to which her character gave name.</p>
        <p>Andrew McGinn is no less expansive as Absolute's father, who believes that most of the world's ills come from teaching girls to read. Jeff Swarthout as the Irish lout Sir Lucius O'Trigger and April Yvette Thompson as Lydia's maid, Lucy, add to the fun.</p>
        <p>Alexander Dodge's clever (and mobile) set evokes the Royal Crescent in Bath, and in one scene deftly recreates the spa's famous Pump Room. Jane Austen would feel at home.</p>
