        <p>If Mariano Rivera pitched the rest of the season as often as he has in the first five weeks, he might set a record for saves. Or he might need a sling for his arm.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have been involved in an inordinate number of close games, with 14 of the first 30 decided by margins of one or two runs, and Rivera has pitched in 15 games. Jeff Nelson, the Yankees' right-handed setup man, is tied for fourth in the league with 16 appearances, and Mike Stanton, the left-handed setup man, ranks first with 18 appearances.</p>
        <p>If they maintain that rate of frequency, Rivera would finish the season with 81 appearances, Nelson 86 and Stanton 97.</p>
        <p>This is not by design; the Yankees do not want to use the threesome so much. But the game situations have dictated the decisions so far, and the situations in which Rivera, Stanton and Nelson are used have surfaced far more than usual.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees figure this is just part of the cycle of a baseball season -- there usually are long periods of time when setup men and closers rarely get to pitch.</p>
        <p>Each day, the Yankees' pitching coach, Mel Stottlemyre, asks his relievers how they feel and whether they are available to pitch, and he is well aware the team has relied heavily on Rivera, Nelson and Stanton.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes you just run through a streak where you're going to use your closer and your late-inning guys a lot,'' Stottlemyre said.</p>
        <p>The Yankees won 114 games during the regular season two years ago and had so many blowouts that Stottlemyre and Manager Joe Torre often had to use Rivera in one-sided games just to get him enough work to keep sharp, and Rivera pitched just 611/3  innings.</p>
        <p>But Rivera currently is on a pace to pitch 101 innings.</p>
        <p>''That's just something that's going to work itself out,'' said Rivera, who indicated that he was feeling good physically. ''I'm real happy for that.''</p>
        <p>Though he earned his 12th save with a seven-pitch shutout inning in last night's 6-3 victory over Tampa Bay, Rivera hasn't been as dominating as he was last year, when he went about two and a half months without allowing a run.</p>
        <p>Rivera has struggled to maintain his pitching mechanics from time to time, to keep his front shoulder from flying open.</p>
        <p>Rivera, who has averaged about 12 to 14 pitches an inning in recent years, is averaging more than 16 this year. The batting averages of opponents soar after Rivera tires a bit and loses his best fastball.</p>
        <p>Rivera, too, has said he has had trouble gripping the ball, something he attributed to the cold weather early in the year. But he mentioned the problem again Sunday, after blowing a save chance for the second time this year: Rivera assumed a 6-4 lead in the top of the ninth against Baltimore and allowed three runs.</p>
        <p>''That hit me hard,'' he said. The Yankees had scored four runs in the eighth to take the lead. ''To see the team fight and come back and they gave me a chance, and then I can't hold it -- that was tough to take.''</p>
        <p>Rivera maintains it has nothing to do with his increased workload, however.</p>
        <p>Nelson did feel somewhat stiff pitching Sunday and guessed it was the result of his many appearances, but eventually, Nelson figures, there will be a rash of games in which he can rest.</p>
        <p>''That's good, because you do need down time, and then there are times where you get in there every day,'' Nelson said.</p>
        <p>Brian Cashman, the Yankees' general manager, said: ''I suspect we'll go through a stretch where the offense will provide more of a cushion. If it went the whole year like this, I would be concerned. But I don't think it would.''</p>
        <p>Then there are the Yankees' two long relievers, caught on the flip side of this cycle, because they don't usually pitch in close games. Todd Erdos has not pitched in a game since April 29, and Darrell Einertson has been waiting to pitch since April 22.</p>
