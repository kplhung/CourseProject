        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>William F. Buckley Jr. (Op-Ed, May 7) admiringly portrays the ''top down'' way in which Cardinal John O'Connor performed his role --  bravely and consistently relaying the decisions of the Roman magisterium to American Catholics -- as the only appropriate diplomatic style. But another, more dialogic model of teaching is also theologically acceptable: one in which the teaching authority always remains a learner, and every learner assumes the role of teacher.</p>

        <p>If the hierarchical church still believes in the ancient adage ''vox populi, vox Dei'' (''the voice of the people is the voice of God''), then a different theology might emerge, one in which the archbishop of New York might indeed translate ''American thoughts'' to Rome and in which Rome would listen with respect.</p>
