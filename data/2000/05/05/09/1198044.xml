        <p>In editing rooms everywhere, people succumb to what might be called rapture of the tape. A snippet of sound or image, repeatedly replayed during editing, begins to seem like a mantra, more potent with every reiteration. Negativland, which has been splicing and manipulating found materials for 20 years, showed some of the symptoms in its show at Irving Plaza on Wednesday night, part of its first tour in seven years.</p>
        <p>Negativland, based in the Bay Area, has devoted itself to what it calls culture jamming: lifting and mixing bits of pop culture, especially advertising, to call into question the credibility of mass media or simply for the fun of it. The group has a weekly radio show on KPFA in Berkeley, and puts out albums of its sound collages; it also tours now and then. In 1991 it ran afoul of U2 and Island Records when it released a single called ''U2'' that used U2's logo on the package and a distorted sample from a U2 song; it was forced to withdraw the single. Now, Negativland sells lapel buttons that read, ''Copyright Infringement Is Your Best Entertainment Value.''</p>

        <p>In editing rooms everywhere, people succumb to what might be called rapture of the tape. A snippet of sound or image, repeatedly replayed during editing, begins to seem like a mantra, more potent with every reiteration.

        <p>Negativland, based in the Bay Area, has devoted itself to what it calls culture jamming: lifting and mixing bits of pop culture, especially advertising, to call into question the credibility of mass media or simply for the fun of it. The group has a weekly radio show on KPFA in Berkeley, and puts out albums of its sound collages; it also tours now and then. In 1991 it ran afoul of U2 and Island Records when it released a single called ''U2'' that used U2's logo on the package and a distorted sample from a U2 song; it was forced to withdraw the single. Now, Negativland sells lapel buttons that read, ''Copyright Infringement Is Your Best Entertainment Value.''</p>
        <p>The two-set, two-and-a-half-hour show, part of which can be heard at www.negativland.com, is called ''True or False,'' a phrase that is one of the concert's recurring sound bites. Negativland attacked its favorite targets -- commercials, fundamentalist Christians, manipulative media -- with varying degrees of deftness and smugness.</p>
        <p>For a group that was prescient enough to proclaim itself a product of the ''Universal Media Netweb'' early in the 1990's, well before the Internet explosion, Negativland uses some charmingly low-tech equipment. Along with a laptop computer and a video monitor, it had home-movie projectors, turntables and a cartridge machine that radio stations use to play effects and commercials; it also had hand puppets.</p>
        <p>Negativland does brilliant scavenging, from old instructional films to unhip music to announcers' outtakes to bits of television news. Posing the sound-bite question ''What's music?,'' it came up with movies demonstrating high-school band instruments and sang a German-accented brass-band version of U2's ''I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For.''</p>
        <p>It also re-edited Julie Andrews singing ''My Favorite Things'' into a more surreal inventory -- ''crisp eyelashes with noodles'' -- and had Ethel Merman belting ''Let's go on with the stealing,'' using words from ''There's No Business Like Show Business.''</p>
        <p>Another piece, adapted from the band's album ''Dispepsi'' (Seeland), piled up bits of cola commercials to suggest a mind-control conspiracy, followed by the plotting of a McDonald's ad: ''We can go out of the ordinary but we can't live there.''</p>
        <p>But there were also shopworn stretches. Parodies of Christian preaching made Negativland seem as intolerant as its targets, and the band was far more fascinated than its listeners by the logical paradox inherent in ''This statement is false.'' A long, hectoring piece about how information overload makes it difficult to sort truth from fiction was old news. As playfulness gave way to didacticism, Negativland's deconstruction of propaganda veered toward propaganda itself.</p>
