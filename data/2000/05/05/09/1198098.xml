        <p>Noisy critics of the Sydney Olympics kicked sand in the eyes of the organizers today in a beach protest staged to attract television coverage and force concessions.</p>
        <p>The demonstrators won network news play here and elsewhere around the country, but did not win a retreat by officials from a decision to stage Olympic volleyball at Bondi Beach.</p>
        <p>Bondi, a Sydney suburban surf center which is an Australian icon and tourist favorite, is scheduled to be the location for the beach volleyball competition. This morning, it was the scene of six hours of political theater about a minor sport that rarely rates attention.</p>
        <p>From dawn about 100 residents opposed to digging up their neighborhood beach scuffled on the sand with 200 police officers trying to keep order with a minimum of headlines while shielding 200 workers starting on the foundations for a 10,000-seat arena. That construction requires shifting about 6,000 tons of sand, excavations that worry environmentalists and surfers.</p>
        <p>Today, the police also deployed two motorboats, a helicopter and 10 mounted officers, but employed minimal force in moving activists who buried themselves to the neck in the sand before a stalled bulldozer.</p>
        <p>They declined to charge the 25 protesters they briefly detained, instead driving them a few miles away before they were released.</p>
        <p>The protest group, Bondi Olympic Watch, includes environmental activists, local retailers, young surfers and aging beach regulars who swim, sunbathe, fly kites and jog year round at the mile-wide Pacific bay five miles east of downtown Sydney.</p>
        <p>The group's spokesman, Lenny Kovner, 53, a theater director, television writer, a former volleyball player, said about 400 opponents of the volleyball competition had signed pledges of civil disobedience to stop or stall construction.</p>
        <p>''We are not against the Olympics or volleyball, but we oppose taking much of our beach away for five months for a 10-day event, which will leave the community nothing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Building the $7 million arena will entail driving 360 steel pylons 20 feet into the fine white sand to support 50-foot high bleachers. Surrounding the framework will be hundreds of 30-footlong plastic tubes, each filled with about 100 tons of sand to keep high tides from eroding the foundations.</p>
        <p>Leaders of the demonstrators assert the erection of the temporary volleyball center, to be dismantled in October, will damage the beach, reduce public access by half and disrupt trade and transportation for months in an already crowded precinct, where about 20,000 people live within a few blocks of the waterfront.</p>
        <p>The general manager of Olympic site operations, John Quayle, said, ''Some disturbance is to be expected with any Olympic facility.'' He promises ''the least possible impact.''</p>
        <p>The site manager, Jackie Murdoch, said Bondi would get a $600,000 improvement of its beach-front community center from the Olympic budget.</p>
        <p>Some protesters say firm guarantees of repair of any environmental damage and major financing for new cultural facilities would satisfy most complaints.</p>
