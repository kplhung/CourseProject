        <p>Once upon a time, Dwight Gooden and David Cone threw very hard for a notorious band of ballplayers in Queens, and if it had been suggested that they would be scraping for 200 career victories, they would have laughed. Two hundred, easy. They would be gunning for 300 victories.</p>

        <p>Once upon a time, Dwight Gooden and David Cone threw very hard for a notorious band of ballplayers in Queens, and if it had been suggested that they would be scraping for 200 career victories, they would have laughed. Two hundred, easy. They would be gunning for 300 victories.</p>
        <p>But at 35 years old, Gooden is straining for 200, hanging on, accepting opportunity from any team willing to extend it to him. From the Yankees' dugout, Cone watched Gooden across the diamond last night, wearing the uniform of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, competing with everything he has. There is a part of Cone that roots for Gooden, for his old friend.</p>
        <p>To get those last 10 victories to reach 200, however, Gooden will need more than good wishes, and he did not have it against the Yankees in his first regular-season outing against his former teammates. Tino Martinez, Clay Bellinger and Paul O'Neill hit homers in Gooden's four and one-third innings, as the Yankees won, 6-3, before 25,361 people at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>Andy Pettitte threw six and two-thirds innings, and Mariano Rivera pitched the ninth inning for his 12th save.</p>
        <p>Veteran baseball people called Gooden the greatest young pitcher they had ever seen when he was a 19-year-old with the Mets, throwing that high, riding fastball that no one could hit and a curveball that made batters flinch at the knees. When Gooden was that good, O'Neill recalled, you could have a runner at third base and nobody out and it still seemed as if Gooden had the advantage.</p>
        <p>But only remnants of that dominance remain. The fastball is 86 to 90 miles an hour; the curve is O.K. He relies on the slider, a pitch he needs to throw for strikes. Gooden had two ignominious seasons with the Cleveland Indians in 1998 and 1999, and he signed a minor league contract with the Houston Astros on the eve of spring training. He pitched once in the regular season for Houston before the Astros, even though starved for pitching in their new ballpark, sold him to the Devil Rays.</p>
        <p>Gooden has won two games for Tampa Bay, victories No. 189 and No. 190, and last week he thought there was a chance he might pitch against Cone, who has won 181. But the Yankees juggled the schedule.</p>
        <p>He faced Pettitte instead. Gooden lacked raw stuff. He threw 33 pitches in the first inning and the Yankee hitters did not swing and miss one time. They swung with gusto, windmill hacks, as if they knew the precise identity and location of the next pitch. Bernie Williams crushed a high drive down the right-field line in the inning, and it hooked foul, barely. Williams ran all the way to first base, thinking it would stay fair, then jerked his head in dismay.</p>
        <p>Gooden's fate appeared all but assured, even with the game still scoreless. He had nothing with which to combat the Yankee hitters: no good fastball or slider, not much control. He was going to take a beating.</p>
        <p>Williams drew a walk, with Ricky Ledee already standing on second base, and Gooden fell behind Martinez three balls and no strikes. Martinez took one strike before blistering the next pitch into the upper deck in right field.</p>
        <p>''That three-run homer got him in the first inning,'' Yankees Manager Joe Torre said, ''so he was fighting uphill from there.''</p>
        <p>Pettitte was erratic, appearing somewhat unwilling to attack the outside part of the strike zone against right-handed hitters, and the Devil Rays tied the score with two runs in the second and another in the third.</p>
        <p>But Gooden tried blowing a high fastball past Bellinger in the bottom of the fifth, and Bellinger measured it perfectly, hammering it over Gooden's head, over the head of Gerald Williams in center field, over the wall.</p>
        <p>Gooden retreated behind the mound to rub a new baseball, his mouth pursed, sweat pouring down his cheeks and forehead.</p>
        <p>He climbed back up the mound, and after issuing another walk, he attempted to spin a curve low to O'Neill. But O'Neill bent over, like someone playing croquet on a warm spring evening, and lined the ball into the right field stands, a two-run homer.</p>
        <p>''Every mistake I made went out of the park,'' Gooden said.</p>
        <p>Cone remarked that Gooden is still a good pitcher, noting how well he pitched in the second, third and fourth innings. But Cone sounded as if he was trying to persuade reporters. He wants his friend to do well, to reach that number that is taking on greater significance than Gooden or Cone expected.</p>
        <p>Two hundred. ''Once you get that close to a number like that,'' Gooden said, ''it becomes a big deal.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>CHUCK KNOBLAUCH took batting practice yesterday for the first time in a week, testing his left hand and wrist. Knoblauch's left hand felt weak, but he wasn't sure if that's what he's supposed to feel after taking time off. ''It's not really pain,'' the second baseman said. ''It did feel like I hadn't hit in a week.'' If Knoblauch feels better, he might return to the lineup as soon as tonight, but it was apparent that Knoblauch didn't know what to think about his status after hitting yesterday. . . . ROBERTO KELLY took batting practice at the Yankees' complex in Tampa, Fla., yesterday, and his right elbow felt O.K. If the outfielder's elbow does not improve, then he will require surgery that will end his season, after only 25 at-bats.</p>
