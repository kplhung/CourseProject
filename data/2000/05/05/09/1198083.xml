        <p>Order a personal computer online or over the phone, choosing every specification, and it will be assembled and shipped to your door in five or six days. But try to order a car from the factory that way, and watch out.</p>
        <p>Buyers who place such orders face stupefyingly complex forms asking them about sometimes obscure features like axle ratios for towing. The few brave enough to fill out the paperwork -- most automakers have yet to computerize the process -- then face a wait long enough to try anyone's patience: three weeks to three months or more.</p>
        <p>Automakers have long been aware of the problem. But now they are striving to speed things up, partly because the Internet makes it possible and partly because their control over the sales process is threatened by online buying services, which allow customers in search of just the right car to check dozens or even hundreds of dealers quickly.</p>
        <p>''We expect that an increasing percentage of consumers will want to order online directly from the factory, get exactly what they want and get it on the desired date,'' said Ronald Zarrella, General Motors' president for North American operations. ''If we can't do that at the factory, we can't add value compared to the pure dot-coms.''</p>
        <p>G.M. and Ford will announce particularly ambitious ventures to accelerate production and delivery in the coming weeks, executives close to the planning said. Both companies will start with one or two models, then convert the rest of their models and factories to faster, more flexible production and distribution. G.M. plans to revamp all its factories in the United States by 2003.</p>
        <p>They and other automakers want to be able, within a few years, to supply exactly the car the customer wants in as little as two weeks. They say the changes could slow increases in car prices, by allowing dealers to cut costs sharply by keeping fewer cars on hand. ''Dealers should be able to reduce their inventory costs,'' said James G. O'Connor, Ford Motor's vice president for Ford brand cars and trucks. ''Hopefully, we should be able to pass that on to consumers.''</p>
        <p>But building cars to order is easier said than done. Automakers hope they can fill most orders not by assembling specific vehicles for specific customers, but by finding vehicles that they have already built but that now sit on a train or at another dealer.</p>
        <p>To improve the odds of finding the right vehicle, manufacturers plan at first to limit customer choice, not expand it. They intend to offer models with just three to five packages of options and in several colors. Dealers will offer accessories like bike racks and fancy hubcaps.</p>
        <p>The planned new production and distribution systems will do little to alleviate overall shortages of instant hits like the Chrysler PT Cruiser that are hard to find in any color; assembly plants can produce only so many vehicles each week. Even with the new system, it will remain difficult to order obscure options on popular models.</p>
        <p>James Clark, a 57-year-old management systems consultant in Washougal, Wash., said that he tried from November through March to order a GMC Sierra 2500 with an extended cab and a short pickup bed, an unusual combination, but that neither he nor his dealer had received even an estimate from G.M. of when the vehicle might be built. ''I was never able to get a straight answer,'' Mr. Clark complained, adding that he ended up buying a one-year-old Chevrolet Silverado pickup instead.</p>
        <p>In addition to G.M. and Ford, the Japanese and Europeans are also experimenting, although Renault of France, which owns Nissan Motor of Japan, is the only non-American automaker committed so far to changing production at all its factories by next year. ''It is a high investment,'' said Carlos Ghosn, Nissan's president. ''There is a high return, too.''</p>
        <p>Toyota is allowing dealers to alter orders for Solara coupes just five days before they are produced at its factory in Cambridge, Ontario, instead of a month. But delivery of the finished car may still take a week or two.</p>
        <p>Using the Internet to help coordinate thousands of parts suppliers, automakers hope to make assembly lines more flexible. When a dealer notices that a certain color or option is in short supply, the manufacturers want to be able to restock the showroom within weeks, not months, so that more customers can avoid having to place special orders.</p>
        <p>Speeding up car production is far more difficult than building computers quickly. Cars require many more components: while Dell relies on 25 main suppliers to assemble desktop computers, DaimlerChrysler has 900 -- even after weeding out the smaller ones several years ago.</p>
        <p>Auto parts tend to be large and expensive, so it is costly to store inventories near assembly plants just in case they are needed. Suppliers are often hundreds of miles away, so a factory in Asheville, N.C., for example, ships anti-lock-brake systems all over the Midwest, making it hard to place last-minute orders.</p>
        <p>If anything, distribution has actually been slowing lately. Railroads are short of rail cars that can carry sport utility vehicles, pickups and minivans, which can only be stacked two high, while cars can be three high. With automobiles of virtually all sizes selling well, the transportation problem has become so acute that thousands of larger vehicles have stacked up in parking lots outside factories. Sending them by truck instead is prohibitively expensive.</p>
        <p>While overnight parcel services can track a packaged shipment anywhere in the country, automakers often have little idea where their cars are, making it hard to reroute them. ''They know the vehicle has left the plant and they know what dealership it's going to, but they don't know where it is during the 30 days or so in between,'' said Daron Gifford, global automotive director at Deloitte &amp; Touche, the accounting and consulting firm.</p>
        <p>All automakers have been studying the problem for years. Now they are doing something.</p>
        <p>Ford is paying particular attention to vehicle distribution and has joined forces with the United Parcel Service to begin tracking every car from factory to dealer to customer. It also has a contract with the Where-Net Corporation to buy miniature radio transmitters. These will be temporarily attached to each vehicle as it comes off the assembly line and will continuously broadcast an identity code, helping workers find specific cars in vast shipping lots. ''That's where they tend to lose track of them,'' said Dan Doles, WhereNet's chief executive.</p>
        <p>One way G.M. hopes to speed production is by using the Internet to communicate with suppliers. G.M. recently joined Ford and DaimlerChrysler in setting up a business exchange for the buying and selling of auto parts and other products. It plans to post constant updates of its production schedules on a secure part of the site available not only to its primary suppliers but to its suppliers' suppliers, and on down the line, said Harold R. Kutner, group vice president for global purchasing.</p>
        <p>Computers at G.M.'s factories are already linked with, for example, dashboard makers. But if there is a sudden increase in demand for CD players, the new system will allow G.M. to notify the dashboard manufacturer and the vendor for CD players simultaneously. ''Suppliers are going to start to get a sense of what's happening in the marketplace,'' Mr. Kutner said.</p>
        <p>Like G.M., Ford is planning to offer a few packages of options, instead of allowing customers to check off dozens or even hundreds of items. This should allow Ford to vary the proportion of these packages at the factory, and fill many orders with cars that have just been built, said James J. Padilla, Ford's group vice president for global manufacturing.</p>
        <p>''You don't need to have 200,000 combinations out there when the consumer can only grapple with maybe 50,'' he said. ''We have been prone to design and release every possible combination, into the hundreds of thousands of combinations, which is a lot of engineering, a lot of tooling and a lot of inventory.''</p>
        <p>Japanese automakers already require customers to choose among packages of options. Toyota, Honda and Nissan managers say that while they are also looking to shorten production and delivery times, they believe that automakers know better than consumers what combination of options make sense for daily use and retain their value.</p>
        <p>If consumers are given too many choices, ''They'll buy a car without an air-conditioner, and they'll be sorry,'' both on warm days and when they try to resell it, said James Press, Toyota's executive vice president for North American sales.</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrysler has been more cautious than G.M. or Ford about accelerating production and delivery. If dealers can be assisted in spotting local shifts in demand more quickly, it contends, they can order the right cars in advance and have them ready when the customer comes in the door. ''That's the way you get fast order to delivery, and not by committing unnatural acts to get it out of the factory quicker,'' said Jamie Jameson, DaimlerChrysler's vice president for North American marketing operations.</p>
        <p>To do this, DaimlerChrysler and other automakers are trying to improve relations with dealers. Dealers do not report a lot of basic information back to manufacturers, like the color of vehicles sold or the prices paid. If, for example, a model in one color is so unpopular that dealers must offer deep discounts, it can take months for the factory to find out.</p>
        <p>''The dealers have never wanted to share pricing information with the manufacturer, and rightly so, because the manufacturers use it against them'' in negotiations over the sharing of various costs, said J. David Power III, founder of the consulting and consumer rating company that bears his name.</p>
        <p>Dealers, of course, try to order cars in colors that have proved popular, and they try to order models they can sell with a minimum of discounting. But since dealers can go months between ordering cars, information filters back slowly to the factories.</p>
        <p>In Japan and Europe, where there is less land for huge dealerships, customers have long ordered cars directly from the factory. Japanese automakers are already able to deliver cars within two weeks in their home market -- but customers, parts suppliers and manufacturers all tend to be very close together.</p>
        <p>The European industry is more fragmented, although not quite as much as the American industry. Renault of France manufactures half its cars to order and delivers them in six to eight weeks, but plans to start making three-quarters of its cars to order and deliver them in just 15 days, at least in European cities close to assembly plants.</p>
        <p>In the long term, said Louis Schweitzer, Renault's chief executive, ''Inventories should be kept only for demonstration purposes: to show the car in showrooms and to drive it.''</p>
