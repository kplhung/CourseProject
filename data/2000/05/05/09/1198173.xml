        <p>A draft proposal from the Clinton administration to safeguard national forests from development would bar road building across nearly one-quarter of those lands but would not immediately rule out future logging or off-road vehicle activity.</p>
        <p>The proposal, which was outlined today by Forest Service officials, is intended to flesh out a pledge that President Clinton has portrayed as a central part of his legacy. But some environmentalists said it fell short of their hopes and warned that it would leave some land open to exploitation.</p>
        <p>The plan was described by Forest Service officials in advance of an announcement on Tuesday. It will be reviewed by the administration after a comment period that is to include 300 public meetings in the next two months, and advocates on both sides of the issue said they held out hope that it would be revised.</p>
        <p>The agriculture secretary, Dan Glickman, who oversees the Forest Service, called the draft plan an important step toward preserving ''among the last and best pristine lands in America.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Glickman said the draft was ''a balanced proposal.'' But he added, ''It's clear to us that any good proposal can be improved upon.''</p>
        <p>The idea of putting so much forest land off limits to roads has been strongly opposed by powerful lawmakers from some Western states, who contend that it would deal a heavy blow to the timber industry.</p>
        <p>But the administration's plan would bypass those critics by using administrative rule changes that do not require Congressional approval.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton first outlined the initiative in a speech last fall, and it is the subject of intense debate on Capitol Hill, where Senator Larry E. Craig, Republican of Idaho, dismissed it today as an unfair ''end run.''</p>
        <p>The Forest Service proposal, in the form of a draft environmental impact statement, provides the first details on the administration's plan. A plan that the agency named among several alternatives as its favored approach would immediately bar road building in virtually all of the large, unprotected roadless areas in the forest system, spanning a total of 43 million acres in 39 states.</p>
        <p>The 155 national forests and grasslands that would be affected include Lewis and Clark National Forest in Montana, Tahoe National Forest in California, Olympic National Forest in Washington and White Mountain National Forest in New Hampshire.</p>
        <p>But the one forest explicitly exempted from the proposal is the Tongass National Forest in Alaska, the nation's largest, where conservation efforts have been opposed by Alaska's Congressional delegation.</p>
        <p>Under the proposal, no decision about whether to set aside roadless areas in the Tongass would be made until at least 2004.</p>
        <p>In laying out the administration's approach last October, near one such forest area in Reddish Knob, Va., Mr. Clinton vowed ''to protect all this before it's too late.''</p>
        <p>But in interviews today, environmentalists criticized the administration's approach. Ken Rait, director of the Heritage Forests Campaign, a Portland, Ore., organization that works for forest protection, said he had hoped the administration would draft a tougher policy that ''completely safeguards these forests.''</p>
        <p>''We are hopeful that the final policy will measure up to the vision that President Clinton laid out last October,'' Mr. Rait said.</p>
        <p>About 34 million acres, or 18 percent, of national forest land has been set aside by Congress as wilderness areas, which are off limits to development and on which roads, logging and off-road vehicles are banned. About 50 percent of national forest land is open to logging or was long ago crisscrossed with roads.</p>
        <p>The administration's plan would cover most of the rest, which is listed by the Forest Service as roadless areas but where road construction has never been totally ruled out. Congressional approval would have been required to formally designate any of the land as wilderness, and the opposition from the Western lawmakers has prompted the administration's effort to act on its own.</p>
        <p>The announcement of the plan comes less than two weeks after the National Park Service imposed a ban on recreational use of snowmobiles at nearly all national parks, monuments and recreational areas.</p>
        <p>The officials who outlined the draft proposal spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying they did not want to upstage Tuesday's announcements in Washington and Phoenix by Mr. Glickman and Mike Dombeck, the Forest Service chief.</p>
        <p>The Forest Service weighed several alternatives to protect the roadless areas, administration officials said. The officials said at least one of those plans would have gone further by ruling out logging. The recommended ban on road building alone was based on the belief that ''road construction represents the single greatest threat to the social and ecological values of roadless areas,'' a Forest Service official said.</p>
        <p>The official said the road ban would have a broad effect because it would make logging and other activities extremely difficult. One official estimated that the approach would reduce future logging by 70 percent in what are now roadless areas.</p>
        <p>But environmentalists said that unless logging and off-road vehicle traffic were explicitly prohibited in the final plan, helicopter logging and other activities could spoil land.</p>
        <p>A top timber industry official said today that the industry expected some form of the broader protection to be put in place.</p>
        <p>''We're not resigned to it getting through without a fight, but I think the odds are that it will get through,'' said the official, W. Henson Moore, president of the American Forest &amp; Paper Association and a former congressman from Louisiana.</p>
