        <p>My intent . . . is not that I deliver a eulogy.  Cardinal O'Connor's often-repeated request was that we gather at this time to pray for him.

        <p>Following are excerpts from the homily delivered yesterday by Cardinal Bernard Law during the funeral Mass for Cardinal John O'Connor, as recorded by The New York Times:</p>
        <p>My intent . . . is not that I deliver a eulogy.  Cardinal O'Connor's often-repeated request was that we gather at this time to pray for him. That we do in the context of the eucharistic sacrifice, which is the source and the summit of the church's life and was so clearly the source and summit of the life of the brother, the uncle, the friend, the priest, the bishop who we bury this day.</p>
        <p>We turn to the Scripture passages just read, and we look to the book of Cardinal O'Connor's life for consolation in our sadness and for inspiration in our lives. . . .</p>
        <p>To have known John Cardinal O'Connor is to have known that what we do at this altar was at the heart of his life each day. Just a few weeks ago, in a visit to his home, we concelebrated Mass. It was so clearly for him the highlight of that day, and for me will remain a most precious memory.</p>
        <p>The course of his illness had made it impossible for him to read. Already his ability to carry out a sustained conversation was impaired. With strength and conviction he was nonetheless able to recite from memory the eucharistic prayer. So much was the Mass a part of his life that when some things began to fade the eucharist did not.</p>
        <p>He was a man of profound and uncomplicated faith in a good and gracious God who has revealed himself in Christ Jesus. He believed in the one holy Catholic Church. He was unswerving in his loyalty to the Holy Father as successor to St. Peter. The words of St. Paul found resonance in his life, when Paul writes, ''I became a minister of this church through the commission God gave me to preach among you his word in all its fullness.'' Certainly, he did not shy away from the task of preaching. He made this pulpit unique in the history of the Catholic Church in the United States.</p>
        <p>God gifted him with a keen and subtle intellect, an uncommon rhetorical skill, a knack for the dramatic gesture, a sharp wit and an outrageous sense of humor, all of which he used in the service of preaching. No one proclaimed what Pope John Paul II has called the gospel of life with greater effectiveness than Cardinal O'Connor. It was in proclaiming that gospel of life that he became a national and international public figure.</p>
        <p>Inevitably there is an effort to categorize public figures as conservative or liberal. Cardinal O'Connor, like the church herself, defies this type of categorization. He was eloquent and unremitting in his defense of the life of the unborn as well as his support of the value of human life to the moment of natural death. Perhaps his most lasting testament in support of life will be the work of the Sisters of Life, a religious community he founded and loved so dearly.</p>
        <p>As he was dying last Wednesday as a result of a disease with terrible consequences, he bore witness one last time to the moral evil of euthanasia and physician-assisted suicide.</p>
        <p>He denounced capital punishment, he championed the rights of workers, he worked for a just peace in the Middle East and in Northern Ireland. Were he in this pulpit today, he would applaud the hope of peace in the I.R.A.'s announcement on decommissioning.</p>
        <p>He preached most powerfully, by his example, the necessity of seeing in every human being, from the first moment of conception to the last moment of natural death and every moment in between, particularly in the poor, in the sick, in the forgotten, the image of a God to be loved and to be served. What a great legacy he has left us in his constant reminder that the church must always be unambiguously pro-life.</p>
        <p>I see he hasn't left the pulpit. A former Navy chaplain, Bishop John MacNamara, recalled for me his first meeting with Cardinal O'Connor on Okinawa. Let me quote from his reminiscence. ''Father O'Connor, the division chaplain of the Marines, came up from Vietnam to interview the new clergy. I remember his first words to me,'' recalls Bishop MacNamara. '' 'I'm John O'Connor. What can I do for you?' I often thought of this meeting because of those words: 'What can I do for you?' So -- those words so characterized and personified the John O'Connor I have known for 35 years. And so many of us have heard him say, 'What can I do for you?' ''</p>
        <p>There was no burden too heavy, no problem too complex for his genuine compassion and desire to help. To understand this in him is to understand that he was to the core of his being a priest. He ministered in the person of Christ, his life was configured to that of Christ as priest and as victim. Again, the words of St. Paul to the Colossians found expression in the life of Cardinal O'Connor. Paul writes: ''Even now I find my joy in the suffering I endure for you. In my own flesh I will fill up what is lacking in the sufferings of Christ for the sake of his body, the church.''</p>
        <p>John O'Connor lived these words. He entered into the lives of countless thousands by identifying with their sufferings in union with Christ. It was thus that he viewed his final illness. He saw himself in solidarity with other cancer patients, and he offered up the sufferings of his illness with the sufferings of Christ. In all of this he knew an incredible peace.</p>
        <p>What a grace it was for his . . . colleagues and friends to be gathered around his bedside when he breathed his last at 8:05 in the evening of last Wednesday, May 3, 2000. We prayed then and we pray now: Saints of God, come to his aid. Come to meet him, angels of the Lord. Receive his soul and present him to God the most high.</p>
