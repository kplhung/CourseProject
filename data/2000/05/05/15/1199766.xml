        <p>Carla Hannan-Welch has always voted for Democrats for president. She has handed out reams of leaflets for Democratic candidates, even pressing her daughter, now 9, into service for the party.</p>
        <p>But this year, things seem different to the 35-year-old special education teacher from Evergreen Park, a suburb south of Chicago. She is disillusioned with Vice President Al Gore and says she is likely to vote for Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>''I don't like the way he carries himself,'' Ms. Hannan-Welch said of Mr. Gore. ''I see him putting his foot in his mouth a lot. My biggest beef is, is someone going to go in there and get things done? With Gore, you don't really know what he believes. It's sort of like, is someone there behind him telling him what to do?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hannan-Welch's negative impression of Mr. Gore was echoed to some degree in recent interviews in Chicago with women who said they normally vote Democratic. While most said they also disliked Governor Bush, they were unenthusiastic about the Democratic alternative.</p>
        <p>''I'm not excited about him,'' said Helen Rabichow, 82, a retired psychologist and Democrat from Chicago's North Side. ''I think it's partly his personality. I think he's kind of a nice jerk. He's a well-meaning, nice guy. But that doesn't necessarily mean that will make him a good president.''</p>
        <p>Similar reactions have been suggested in recent national polls. They have found that Mr. Bush is preferred by women, particularly married women and mothers. The results have caused enough concern among Gore supporters that last week representatives of groups like the National Organization for Women met with Mr. Gore to urge him to work harder to reach women.</p>
        <p>In general, the Chicago women interviewed who were sour on Mr. Gore were not reacting to specific issues. Several agreed with his platform, while others said they knew little about his views. Instead, several women said they had a negative gut feeling about him, that he lacked charisma or seemed untrustworthy.</p>
        <p>By contrast, those women interviewed who supported Mr. Gore generally attributed their approval to his views on issues like abortion, the environment and education, saying that once others understood his positions they would support him, too.</p>
        <p>Women have been vital for Democrats in recent presidential elections. ''Soccer moms'' in particular helped Bill Clinton win in 1992 and 1996. And Illinois is an important swing state where Chicago usually produces a reliable Democratic majority. A poll this month by the American Research Group found that the candidates were tied in Illinois.</p>
        <p>''Am I concerned about it? Absolutely,'' said Peter Giangreco, a Gore campaign adviser in Illinois. But, ''if I wasn't concerned about women I'd be freaking out about some other group because that's what we do. All we do is obsess about groups like rural white men over 50 and women with cell phones under 30.''</p>
        <p>He and other Gore supporters said it was still early in the campaign and most voters were not paying attention. Mr. Giangreco said most still knew little about Mr. Gore, and that he was at his best speaking directly to voters and in debates ''mano a mano.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giangreco said that at this point in the 1992 campaign, polls showed women did not like Mr. Clinton, but ''in the end, we had a massive gender gap, very strong women for Bill Clinton.''</p>
        <p>Gore strategists have been concerned for at least a year about polls showing that women preferred Mr. Bush, and Mr. Gore's campaign appearances have emphasized his longstanding women-friendly agenda.</p>
        <p>By and large, the women who were interviewed said their views of President Clinton had no bearing on how they saw Mr. Gore. A few said they wished Mr. Clinton were running again. And those disillusioned by the Monica Lewinsky scandal said they did not view Mr. Gore in that context.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore's position as vice president struck some as a liability.</p>
        <p>''He hasn't come into his own,'' said Barb Meyers, 43, a dental hygienist from a white ethnic enclave in Southwest Chicago. ''He's always kind of been in Clinton's shadow. He doesn't strike me as having a real strong persona.''</p>
        <p>Several women said they thought Mr. Gore lacked backbone.</p>
        <p>Jackie Pomarski, 34, a homemaker from a Democratic working-class Southwest Chicago neighborhood, said Mr. Gore ''will say whatever he needs to say to please the crowd. He's kind of a snake in the grass. When he talks I feel like he always has a big smirk on his face.''</p>
        <p>Some said they felt that Mr. Gore did not have the intellectual muscle or skills to be president, despite his Harvard degree and cerebral reputation, plus the eight years he has had to soak up the details and abilities a president needs.</p>
        <p>''I don't think that Gore has the right stuff for the presidency,'' said Irene Cohen, a Clinton supporter in her 60's. ''I don't think he has the ability, I don't think he's smart enough, I don't think he presents himself to the public well enough.''</p>
        <p>Some women's reactions suggested that either Mr. Gore had not communicated his opinions well enough or they did not matter.</p>
        <p>''Bush just exudes tremendous self-confidence,'' said Ms. Hannan-Welch, an abortion rights supporter. She said some of her relatives would ''roll over in their graves'' if they heard her now. ''He kind of reminds me of a Kennedy. If you look at the Kennedys, they had these issues, they stood up for them. I may not agree with everything he says, but he has a plan and he moves forward.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Rabichow, a Bill Bradley supporter, said she did not know Mr. Gore's views on her critical issues, Medicare and prescription drugs. ''I don't know what issues he has,'' she said. ''Clinton was certainly much more outspoken. Clinton's a much brighter guy than Gore.''</p>
        <p>Some women did mention issues, criticizing, for example, Mr. Gore's break with the Clinton administration when he said Elian Gonzalez and his father should be given permanent residency status.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Pomarski, who opposes abortion, said that Mr. Gore flip-flopped on the issue. He opposed federal financing of abortion early in his Congressional career, but has supported abortion rights for many years. She said she liked his positions on Northern Ireland and on education.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's supporters said they were confident that he would excite voters once they saw him and Mr. Bush in conventions and debates.</p>
        <p>''Every time we are at an event with him, women are just overtaken by how funny he is and how smart and how charismatic, and I say I told you so,'' said Kitty Kurth, a Democratic political consultant in Chicago.</p>
        <p>Christie Hefner, the chairwoman and chief executive of Playboy Enterprises, who is active in Democratic politics, said it was reassuring that women disenchanted with Mr. Gore freely acknowledged they did not know his opinions on issues.</p>
        <p>''You're in trouble as a candidate if the voters understand you and reject you,'' she said. ''There's a great opportunity here,'' she said. ''You know he's smart enough, you know he's experienced enough.''</p>
        <p>Nearly all the women interviewed were equally critical of Mr. Bush and said they could not see voting for him. Mrs. Pomarski, for example, called the Texas governor ''sinister.'' And Mrs. Cohen said, ''I don't think either one of them is really capable. If I had to go to the polls right now, I'd vote for Mickey Mouse.''</p>
