        <p>In the annals of best-sellerdom, no title seemed more unlikely to claw up the elite ranks than this sober blue number: Statehood Quarter Folder No. 1 1999-2001.</p>
        <p>But St. Martin's Press has a quirky phenomenon on its hands that is giving the publishing house a Harry Potter-like rush of sales, although in this case the magic comes from shiny quarters.</p>
        <p>In the last four weeks, the publishing company started sending out four new titles in its classic Whitman series of coin collecting albums and guides. The company said its sales of the coin books quadrupled in 1999 and were expected to do the same this year -- fueled by a collecting frenzy over the newly minted quarters that are being issued for each of the 50 states.</p>
        <p>Whitman and its familiar ''little blue penny books'' have been around for more than six decades. St. Martin's Press purchased the imprint from Golden Books in 1999 and since then has been nurturing the market by expanding distribution from coin stores to bookstores, drugstores, warehouse clubs, supermarkets and airports.</p>
        <p>By the first week of May, the basic $3 Statehood Quarter album had climbed its way up the list of trade paperback best sellers tracked by Book Sense, which collects sales information from more than 300 independent bookstores in the United States. At No. 9, the album was just a step behind ''The Professor and the Madman,'' Simon Winchester's book about how a murderer helped compile the Oxford English Dictionary.</p>
        <p>The album has also surfaced on internal best-seller lists kept by the large bookstore chains and some large discount stores like Target.</p>
        <p>''These are the kind of blue books that people kept in their attics,'' said Lisa Senz, an associate publisher in St. Martin's reference division. ''Everybody remembers these classics from when they were a kid.''</p>
        <p>Naturally, executives at St. Martin's are pondering the possibilities for the next fashion in coin collecting. The company has just issued a two-page album to contain the newly minted Sacagawea dollar coin. It is considering issuing a New York album timed to coincide with the arrival of New York State quarters in 2001.</p>
