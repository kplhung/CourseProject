        <p>Comparing the proposed breakup of Microsoft to the AT&amp;T case of the 1980's, Brad Smith, a Microsoft lawyer, said he saw one big difference.</p>
        <p>''AT&amp;T was mostly a national company,'' he said, ''but Microsoft is operating in a global marketplace. If we are replaced as the technology leader, there's no guarantee that our successor will be from this country.''</p>

        <p>Comparing the proposed breakup of Microsoft to the AT&amp;T case of the 1980's, Brad Smith, a Microsoft lawyer, said he saw one big difference.</p>
        <p>''AT&amp;T was mostly a national company,'' he said, ''but Microsoft is operating in a global marketplace. If we are replaced as the technology leader, there's no guarantee that our successor will be from this country.''</p>
        <p>Seventeen years ago, as AT&amp;T was preparing to spin off its regional telephone companies to resolve an antitrust case, Charles Brown, AT&amp;T's chairman, had a similar thought.</p>
        <p>''I guess the competition feels pretty good about it,'' he said. ''The Japanese, primarily.''</p>
        <p>As the Microsoft antitrust case hurtles toward its conclusion, both sides are drawing on the experiences of AT&amp;T to support their legal and political arguments, though in some cases the references are inaccurate or incomplete. And a few of Microsoft's darkest predictions mirror arguments AT&amp;T made 20 years ago -- predictions that never came to pass.</p>
        <p>Microsoft's legal briefs rebutting the government's breakup proposal, filed with the court on Wednesday, include numerous references to the AT&amp;T case, and Joel I. Klein, head of the Justice Department's antitrust division, devoted considerable attention to the subject in a speech on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The record shows that in the late 1970's and early 1980's, AT&amp;T mounted aggressive legal arguments against the government's proposed breakup plan. Innovation would be stifled, research stunted and a precious national resource -- the world's best telephone system -- would be destroyed.</p>
        <p>None of that happened.</p>
        <p>Of course, there is nothing to demonstrate that if Microsoft is broken up, its experience, for better or worse, will resemble AT&amp;T's. Still, in invoking the AT&amp;T case to justify some of its arguments, Microsoft is in some instances misstating the record.</p>
        <p>Consider Bell Labs, which was the vaunted research arm of AT&amp;T, and its counterpart at Microsoft, the research division. The government's breakup proposal makes no recommendation for how Microsoft's research group would be treated; that would be decided later.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Microsoft's brief said: ''Research and development organizations are fragile organisms, and the notion that they can be be pulled apart with minimal adverse consequences is dangerously naive.''</p>
        <p>''The one unit of AT&amp;T that remained intact during AT&amp;T's divestiture of its regional operating companies,'' it adds, ''was Bell Laboratories, an organization with strong parallels to Microsoft as a whole.''</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T, like Microsoft, argued during its trial that a breakup would damage or destroy the company's research capabilities. But in fact, Bell Labs, formed in 1925, was broken up along with the rest of the company; 7,500 of the lab's 25,000 employees were taken away to form the nucleus of the new Bellcore research lab serving regional telephone companies. AT&amp;T has since spun off Bell Labs; now it is part of Lucent Technologies. And the engineers and executives leading the labs today say they believe they are doing quite well.</p>
        <p>''It sure looks to us like we've been just as prolific in the last 15 years as were were in the previous 50,'' said Michael Jacobs, a spokesman for the labs. ''The pace of innovation at Bell Labs today is faster than it's ever been.'' Bell Labs scientists have won two Nobel prizes in the last 15 years, in 1997 and 1998, compared to 4 in the previous 50 years. Mr. Jacobs said he believed the prospect of increased competition after the breakup energized the Bell Labs scientists and ''fired up'' the labs.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere in its brief, Microsoft seeks to draw a fundamental distinction with AT&amp;T by arguing that ''Microsoft is a unitary company,'' not ''an agglomeration of separate operating companies.''</p>
        <p>As it happens, AT&amp;T made the same argument during its trial. Central to its lawyers' defense was that ''the Bell system was so tightly integrated that you could not take it apart without doing enormous damage to the best telephone system in the world,'' said Philip Verveer, a Washington lawyer who worked for the government during the early stages of the AT&amp;T case.</p>
        <p>''They showed that they had a tremendous number of assets in common, and the entire industry was structured around integration'' -- down to the long distance toll switches embedded in the local phone switching stations.</p>
        <p>A expert witness who testified on behalf of the Bell system during that trial, but who asked not to be identified, said the company's legal team tried to make the case that ''the monopoly was necessary for rapid technological change.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Verveer added: ''They said they could not be pulled apart, but all of these arguments proved to be incorrect.''</p>
        <p>Now Microsoft is also arguing that continued innovation will be threatened if the company is split up. Microsoft's success and ability to create innovative new products ''would not have been possible but for Microsoft's unified structure.''</p>
        <p>Another AT&amp;T argument is more complicated, with both Microsoft and the government falling afoul of history.</p>
        <p>Acknowledging that AT&amp;T did remain a highly innovative company after it was broken up, Microsoft argues in its brief that it was not the breakup that freed AT&amp;T to compete and innovate, but an accompanying order to deregulate it.</p>
        <p>In his speech on Tuesday, Mr. Klein countered that by noting that AT&amp;T and the Baby Bells were left with significant restrictions prohibiting them from entering one another's markets. But Microsoft notes that AT&amp;T labored under a far more onerous regulation previously, prohibiting the unified company from branching into new businesses not related to telephony.</p>
        <p>Maybe so, a government official said, but while AT&amp;T was a monopoly, smaller companies trying to make telephone equipment ''kept running into AT&amp;T and got nowhere if AT&amp;T wasn't interested -- that's exactly analogous to Microsoft.'' The company disputes that.</p>
        <p>Mr. Verveer said the analogies could be taken only so far. ''The AT&amp;T case was about physical assets primarily,'' he noted, ''while with Microsoft we are largely talking about human capital -- very smart people.''</p>
        <p>As Microsoft does, Mr. Verveer said that makes the outcome of this case harder to predict.</p>
