        <p>Brown's openweight women gained their third consecutive varsity Eastern Women's Spring Rowing Championship yesterday, and Brown also captured the novice and junior varsity eight-oared races on Lake Waramaug in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Brown's varsity spotted Radcliffe a few seats in the opening 500 meters of this headwind-swept 2,000-meter course before drawing even and then rowing away to win in 6 minutes 38.50 seconds. The Brown boat was 6.4 seconds, or one and a half boat lengths, ahead of second-place Radcliffe, which withstood a challenge from Princeton at the 1,250-meter mark to hold on to the runner-up position. Virginia, Boston University and Yale rounded out the order of finish.</p>

        <p>Brown's openweight women gained their third consecutive varsity Eastern Women's Spring Rowing Championship yesterday, and Brown also captured the novice and junior varsity eight-oared races on Lake Waramaug in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Brown's varsity spotted Radcliffe a few seats in the opening 500 meters of this headwind-swept 2,000-meter course before drawing even and then rowing away to win in 6 minutes 38.50 seconds. The Brown boat was 6.4 seconds, or one and a half boat lengths, ahead of second-place Radcliffe, which withstood a challenge from Princeton at the 1,250-meter mark to hold on to the runner-up position. Virginia, Boston University and Yale rounded out the order of finish.</p>
        <p>Brown has only the University of Washington, the perennial West Coast powerhouse, to beat to claim its second N.C.A.A. title. That race is to be held in Camden, N.J., on May 28.</p>
        <p>Brown scored a 9.40-second junior varsity victory over Princeton, and its novice crew won by 4.90 seconds over Radcliffe. The University of Virginia won the open varsity four with coxswain event, in which Brown finished third, behind Cornell. On the basis of its overall squad performance, Brown won the Charles Willing Trophy with a total of 72 points, followed by Princeton with 62. Brown's varsity also won the Sally P. Shoemaker Trophy, which goes to the highest-placing Ivy League crew at these championships.</p>
