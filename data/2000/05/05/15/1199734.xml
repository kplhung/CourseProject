        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>I live in Kittery, Me., but work in New York occasionally. Many of my friends at home think I am a nut for diving into the New York experience regularly. This incident, which seemed very un-New York and at the same time very New York, is one of the reasons I do it.</p>
        <p>I left a showroom in SoHo just before 6 p.m. and headed across Spring Street for the subway. It was raining and it was cold, and I was without an umbrella. I had about seven blocks to walk and, of course, cabs vaporize in the rain.</p>

        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>I live in Kittery, Me., but work in New York occasionally. Many of my friends at home think I am a nut for diving into the New York experience regularly. This incident, which seemed very un-New York and at the same time very New York, is one of the reasons I do it.</p>
        <p>I left a showroom in SoHo just before 6 p.m. and headed across Spring Street for the subway. It was raining and it was cold, and I was without an umbrella. I had about seven blocks to walk and, of course, cabs vaporize in the rain.</p>
        <p>I reached a corner where I had to stop for a ''Don't Walk'' sign, and as I stood, getting wetter by the second, an umbrella was suddenly extended over my head. I turned and a woman in her late 20's said, ''I'll share with you.''</p>
        <p>What does she want? Twenty bucks for her half of the umbrella? Not at all.</p>
        <p>As we crossed the street, with me still beneath the sweet dryness, she asked where I was going. I told her the subway at Sixth Avenue, and she said she was going almost as far so we could continue to share.</p>
        <p>When we came to her street, she said she had  time and would I like her to walk me the rest of the way to the subway, about a block. I refused -- she had done more than enough. After thanking her, I said I hoped someone would do something that nice for her someday. She said, ''They have,'' and walked away.</p>
        <p>It was a lovely moment of kindness from a stranger in a city often maligned.</p>
        <p>KATHY JERRAM</p>
        <p>A friend who occasionally drops into a gym overheard one of the personal trainers describing a client who is a ballet dancer. ''She's so limber, she can hail a cab with her leg,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For more than a year, Sue Conklin had been taking the N train from her apartment in Brooklyn to her office in Manhattan. She rode at the same time every day and got on the car that would let her off at the exit closest to her office. Ms. Conklin wore a chignon, but on one bad-hair day, rather than fighting to make her long hair stay up, she simply left it down. She got on the train and was reading her newspaper when one of the other passengers turned to her and said, ''Looks better down.'' He returned to his paper, and nothing further was said by either one. She has since taken frequently to wearing her hair down.</p>
        <p>Wilma Askinas was in a doctor's office when she overheard the following anecdote being told by a fellow patient-in-waiting.</p>
        <p>''My friend wrote to a mail-order house and said, 'Please send me the catalog you show and if it's any good I'll order and send you a check.' A week later she received a reply: 'Please send check. If it's any good we'll send you the catalog.' ''</p>
        <p>Carol Ruth Langer stopped at the information desk of a Barnes &amp; Noble in Midtown to inquire about a copy of the Book of Job.</p>
        <p>''How would you be spelling 'Job'?'' the clerk asked.</p>
        <p>''J -- O -- B,'' Ms. Langer said.</p>
        <p>''Job books are in the career section.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Langer tried again. ''Not job, Job, a book in the Bible.''</p>
        <p>''Who is the author?'' the clerk asked.</p>
        <p>Ms. Langer knew it was time to leave.</p>
        <p>THOSE WERE THE DAYS</p>
        <p>New Yorkers of a certain age mourned the loss of Hedy Lamarr.</p>
        <p>Her exotic image epitomized the era of the ''star.''</p>
        <p>Like Jean Harlow, Carole Lombard, Bette Davis, Joan Crawford,</p>
        <p>Gary Cooper, John Gilbert, Robert Taylor, Peter Lawford.</p>
        <p>Randolph Scott, Joel McCrea, Tom Mix, John Payne,</p>
        <p>Norma Shearer, Loretta Young, Joan Bennett, Jeanne Crain.</p>
        <p>Mary Pickford, Marie Dressler, Dolores Del Rio, Clara Bow,</p>
        <p>Douglas Fairbanks, Tyrone Power, Victor McLaglen, Edmund Lowe.</p>
        <p>Charles Boyer, Wallace Beery, Paul Muni, Franchot Tone,</p>
        <p>Lon Chaney, Boris Karloff, Pat O'Brien, Lewis Stone.</p>
        <p>John Garfield, Ronald Colman, William Powell, Gilbert Roland,</p>
        <p>Colleen Moore, Elissa Landi, Lillian Gish, Mary Boland.</p>
        <p>Sylvia Sidney, Laraine Day, Mary Astor, ZaSu Pitts,</p>
        <p>Lew Ayres, Claude Rains, Chico Marx, Harry Ritz.</p>
        <p>Miriam Hopkins, Jean Arthur, Barbara Stanwyck, Janet Gaynor,</p>
        <p>Anne Baxter, Helen Hayes, Ida Lupino, Luise Rainer.</p>
        <p>Hugh Herbert, Leo Carrillo, Fredric March, Vincent Price,</p>
        <p>Olivia de Havilland, Agnes Moorehead, Gail Patrick, Fanny Brice.</p>
        <p>Older New Yorkers will easily recall these names and others,</p>
        <p>Younger ones may have to seek help from fathers and mothers.</p>
        <p>JAMES E. HOWARD</p>
        <p>Goings-on at a recent series of the Wagner ''Ring'' at the Metropolitan Opera:</p>
        <p>Nancy Connell was at a performance of ''Die Walkure,'' which was to be followed two days later by ''Siegfried,'' when a member of the audience turned in his seat as the curtain calls ended and shouted at a neighbor, ''How dare you come to the 'Ring' with a cough? You have no business attending such an important performance with a cold! Furthermore, this is a public place and you will infect us all!'' He shouted for a few more moments and ended with ''See a doctor before 'Siegfried!' '' before storming out.</p>
        <p>Peter Brown attended the four operas in the ''Ring'' cycle and observed a topsy-turvy situation. Every night at intermission, he said, the men's restroom had long lines waiting for admission while the women's room was comparatively uncrowded. He's still trying to figure out what accounted for this reversal.</p>
        <p>Setting: 42nd Street shuttle train, weekday morning.</p>
        <p>Players: Two tough-looking young men who hop on as the doors close.</p>
        <p>Observer: Mary Jane Cote, one of the passengers.</p>
        <p>Scene: The men try, unsuccessfully, to make eye contact with some of the riders before the train begins to move. Finally, one addresses an anxious-looking man and asks, ''What time is it?</p>
        <p>The other passengers look on as the man pulls his coat sleeve back to check his wristwatch. ''It's 8:45,'' he says hesitantly.</p>
        <p>Both the tough-looking young men yell: ''Wrong! It's be-bop time.''</p>
        <p>They then break into dance steps to accompany their original be-bop song and entertain for the crosstown trip.</p>
