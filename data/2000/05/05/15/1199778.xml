        <p>With a rallying cry of ''enough is enough,'' hundreds of thousands of mothers and other gun control advocates marched on the nation's capital and in several cities around the country today, demanding ''sensible gun laws,'' mourning the loss of children to gun violence and vowing to transform the politics of gun control.</p>
        <p>Under a clear spring sky, the Million Mom March crowded the grassy expanse of the National Mall, cheering one speaker after another who assailed the National Rifle Association and its power over Congress. Many of the demonstrators wept at the stories of mothers who had lost their children, listening transfixed to the families shattered by shootings from Columbine High School, in Littleton, Colo., where 15 died last year, to the Michigan elementary school where a 6-year-old girl was killed by a classmate on Feb. 29.</p>

        <p>With a rallying cry of ''enough is enough,'' hundreds of thousands of mothers and other gun control advocates marched on the nation's capital and in several cities around the country today, demanding ''sensible gun laws,'' mourning the loss of children to gun violence and vowing to transform the politics of gun control.</p>
        <p>Under a clear spring sky, the Million Mom March crowded the grassy expanse of the National Mall, cheering one speaker after another who assailed the National Rifle Association and its power over Congress. Many of the demonstrators wept at the stories of mothers who had lost their children, listening transfixed to the families shattered by shootings from Columbine High School, in Littleton, Colo., where 15 died last year, to the Michigan elementary school where a 6-year-old girl was killed by a classmate on Feb. 29.</p>
        <p>''I come to you today, two days after what would have been her seventh birthday,'' said Veronica McQueen, the Michigan girl's mother. ''I am a mom with a terrible tragedy, and I hope it never, ever happens again.''</p>
        <p>It was a Mother's Day of high emotion and powerful imagery, both here and in more than 60 other demonstrations scheduled around the country this weekend. Many in the crowd on the Mall today wore T-shirts with the photographs of family members killed by guns. Judi Ellis of Toledo, Ohio, carried a placard that declared, ''I march today to save a child tomorrow,'' with a picture of her son, who was killed in 1995, just before he left for college. ''You're not supposed to bury your son,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Much of the crowd seemed to be the quintessential suburban mothers who are so intensely pursued in politics today, not touched by the issue of gun violence themselves but outraged at its toll and fearful of its spread. They came in sensible shoes and straw hats, with extra water and strollers for their children, and when the children's performer Raffi took the stage, they happily sang along with ''This Little Light of Mine.''</p>
        <p>Longtime advocates for gun control urged them to make themselves felt on Election Day. ''You are the future now,'' said Sarah Brady of Handgun Control Inc., who became an activist on gun control after her husband, James S. Brady, a former White House press secretary, was seriously injured in the assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. ''We must either change the minds of lawmakers on these issues or, for God's sake, this November let's change the lawmakers.''</p>
        <p>President Clinton, greeting some of the marchers at the White House this morning, also urged them to keep fighting. ''Don't be deterred by the intimidation, don't be deterred by the screaming, don't be deterred by the political mountain you have to climb,'' he said. ''You just remember this: there are more people who think like you in America.''</p>
        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton, a candidate for the Senate in New York,  joined the march. Earlier, at the White House, she struck a theme that was heard again and again from the speakers: ''I think it sometimes takes women to stand up and say, enough is enough. Enough is enough.  We have had enough bloodshed, enough violence. When children are afraid to walk down their own blocks, or walk into their own schools, or when parents are afraid to let children even visit neighbors, it is time to say, enough.''</p>
        <p>Rosie O'Donnell, the mistress of ceremonies today, who touted the rally on her TV talk show and was greeted like a rock star, voiced the organizers' hopes when she declared, ''The rally is over, the movement has just begun.''</p>
        <p>The Million Mom March was the brainchild of Donna Dees-Thomases, a part-time publicist for CBS, the sister-in-law of Susan Thomases, a close friend of Mrs. Clinton, and a New Jersey mother who said her maternal instincts kicked in after the shooting last August at a Jewish community center in Los Angeles. The march supported an array of gun legislation, notably registration for all handguns and licensing of all handgun owners.</p>
        <p>The National Rifle Association and its allies denounced the march's agenda today, asserting that ''registration and licensing schemes'' were in fact ''a controlled burn of the Second Amendment, and setting fire to freedom should never be the answer,'' in the words of Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the group. Speaking on the NBC program ''Meet the Press,'' Mr. LaPierre said the Million Mom March agenda was ''out of step with moms, and I think it's out of step with the American public,'' and suggested that its organizers were allied with the Democrats. The criticism was dismissed by Ms. Dees-Thomases.</p>
        <p>Whatever its lasting impact, the Million Mom March clearly pushed the gun issue onto the national agenda in recent days. And it highlighted what the latest New York Times/ CBS News Poll found about women:  that they tend to be stronger supporters of new restrictions on guns.</p>
        <p>Seventy-eight percent of the women in the new poll said laws covering the sale of handguns should be made stricter, compared with 62 percent of the men. The poll has an overall margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.</p>
        <p>Still, there was a small demonstration in Washington today sponsored by women who oppose new gun laws, a group known as Second Amendment Sisters. ''This is our response to the Million Mom March,'' said Juli Bednarzyk, a co-founder of the group. ''They said they were speaking for all women and we thought, 'Well, they don't speak for us. There are women who feel differently.' ''</p>
        <p>An N.R.A. member and gun owner, Ms. Bednarzyk said she had no ill will toward the people on the other end of the Mall. ''We have the same goal as those women -- safe children,'' she said, adding that they just had different ways of getting to that goal. On the stage, speakers denounced ''liberal judges,'' ''predator criminals'' and ''the million misinformed moms.''</p>
        <p>Organizers of the Million Mom March said their crowd numbered 750,000 in Washington; the number could not be independently confirmed as the federal Park Police no longer gives crowd estimates after years of controversy over how many people attend events like these. It appeared to be one of the largest gatherings on the Mall in recent years, and it clearly was a showing that gladdened the hearts of longtime gun control organizers.</p>
        <p>According to The Associated Press, the Washington area subway system had carried 252,246 riders by 5 p.m. On a typical Sunday, it carries about 170,000 riders.</p>
        <p>Around the country, in cities from Birmingham, Ala., to Los Angeles, thousands attended other mothers' rallies. In Denver, the police estimated the crowd at 3,000. The main speaker was Tom Mauser, whose son was killed at Columbine High School.</p>
        <p>''You may have heard that Colorado is ground zero in the gun debate,'' Mr. Mauser declared. ''You bet it is.  And we're going to show the rest of the nation how you respond to it.''</p>
        <p>In Los Angeles, politicians read the names of children killed by guns in Los Angeles County in 1999. Ann Rice Lane, chairwoman of Women against Gun Violence, which was the program's host, said: ''Today is an event. Tomorrow the work begins.''</p>
        <p>And in Chicago, amid protests from counterdemonstrators shouting ''Ban the gangs, not the guns,'' women gathered at Grant Park.  Obrellia Smith, 50, said, ''I hope we will send a message to the legislators that they have to do something about this gun epidemic or they will lose their seats. We're losing too many babies.''</p>
        <p>Democrats clearly hoped that the rallies would mark a sea change in the politics of gun control and an end to the truism that the gun lobby can turn out its vote, while the forces of gun control cannot. Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who attended today's march in Washington, said, in a reference to Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee: ''Bush ought to be terrified. Look out there -- that is the face of the soccer mom.''</p>
        <p>But polls have shown that women are almost evenly divided in their views of how the two presidential candidates handle the gun issue. The latest New York Times/CBS News Poll asked, ''Regardless of which candidate you prefer for president, who do you agree with more on the issue of gun control -- Al Gore or George W. Bush?'' Thirty-five percent of the women said they agreed more with Mr. Gore, while 30 percent said they agreed more with Mr. Bush. Among mothers, 33 percent said they agree more with Mr. Bush, 24 percent with Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>That bipartisan note was struck today by one of the speakers, Dr. Antonia C. Novello, the New York State health commissioner, who declared, ''Protecting the rights of children is not Democrat or Republican, it is simply the right thing to do.''</p>
        <p>In the end, for all the political maneuvering, there was a nonpartisan tone to much of the day. Many of the women came to the march through their churches or synagogues, or heard about the march on television or on the Internet. The organizers said there were five million hits on the Million Mom March Web site in the last six days.</p>
        <p>At a ''Tapestry'' display in the middle of the Mall, where marchers could post messages, most were anything but political:</p>
        <p>''In memory of Steve Smith. We won't forget.''</p>
        <p>''For Mrs. Willis's son. Killed over a pen.''</p>
        <p>''Christopher, We love you and miss you. Mommy is here and Daddy and Justin, in your memory.''</p>
        <p>''Enough is enough.''</p>
        <p>Around that display, and throughout much of the rally, the mood was one of simple grief. ''We're hurting,'' said Vicky Lindsey, a founder of Justice for Murdered Children, whose 19-year-old son was killed five years ago. ''We are truly hurting.''</p>
