        <p>Paul O'Neill joined the Yankees eight years ago and has amassed a .311 average, 500 walks, three championship rings and zero sacrifice bunts. Leading off the ninth inning here today, O'Neill ran his right hand up the bat handle and jabbed at the ball, trying to bunt his way on base.</p>
        <p>O'Neill's thought and strategy were sound, with Detroit's corner infielders playing back and the Yankees down by two runs and needing base runners. His desperation to reach base, however, speaks to the larger problem for the Yankees, who lost by 2-1 today and were swept in this three-game series against the last-place Tigers: their offense has deserted them.</p>
        <p>''The ball is juiced everywhere but where we play,'' O'Neill said mournfully.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have lost four straight and fallen out of first place in the American League East for the first time since April 12. With a record of 22-13, they are a half-game behind the Boston Red Sox. The Yankees have, however, been through these ebbs and flows in the last two seasons, on their way to 212 regular-season victories and two titles.</p>
        <p>The Tigers swept three games from them last year, and from May 18 to June 8 of last year, the Yankees resided in second place, behind the Red Sox. The Yankees' bullpen has been exceptional this year, and the starting pitching has been good; David Cone pitched seven strong innings today and took the loss despite allowing just two runs, on R.B.I. singles by Juan Gonzalez in the third inning and Juan Encarnacion in the fifth. They would win 102 games in the regular season if they continued to play at their current rate of success.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees' hitters are floundering, collectively, ranking next-to-last in the league in runs, total bases and walks. They are 12th in on-base percentage and 11th in slugging percentage among the league's 14 teams. The Yankees have held a lead for exactly one-half of an inning in the last four games, when they took a 1-0 edge in the second inning of Saturday's loss before surrendering four runs in the bottom of the second.</p>
        <p>''You've got to believe that offensively, there are going to be times when we're going to do a lot of things,'' O'Neill said. ''But right now it's not one of those times. Offensively, we haven't clicked, there's no doubt about it.''</p>
        <p>Referring to opposing pitchers, O'Neill added: ''It gets kind of kind of monotonous saying, 'He pitched a good game.' It's about time we hit the ball.''</p>
        <p>Detroit's Dave Mlicki was without a victory in his first six starts this year, but he did pitch well today. As a member of the Mets, Mlicki shut out the Yankees in the first interleague game between the two teams in 1997, throwing lots of fastballs and curveballs and lots of strikes. He relied more on his changeup today than his curveball, throwing lots of strikes, and when he didn't throw strikes, the Yankees were hacking at his first pitch.</p>
        <p>Eight of the first 18 Yankee batters swung at the first pitch -- and often were off balance, because Mlicki would throw off-speed pitches. Only twice among the first 31 hitters did the Yankees reach favorable hitters' counts of 2 balls and 0 strikes, or 3-1.</p>
        <p>After Jorge Posada walked and Shane Spencer singled to open the second inning, Mlicki retired 17 consecutive batters. Spencer broke the streak by dumping a bloop hit with two outs in the seventh, when the Yankees trailed by 2-0, and Scott Brosius pulled a hard shot down the third-base line, a ball destined for the left-field corner, a would-be run-scoring double. But Detroit's Dean Palmer deftly backhanded the smash and threw Brosius out to end the inning. When a frustrated Brosius returned to his position, he glanced into the Tigers' dugout until making eye contact with Palmer and lifted a finger to the bill of his cap: nice play.</p>
        <p>After O'Neill fouled off his bunt attempt in the ninth, he flied to left and Bernie Williams grounded to second. One out away from his second career shutout of the Yankees -- and his third shutout overall -- Mlicki walked Tino Martinez and Posada and then was replaced by Todd Jones. Spencer singled and Martinez scored; the Yankees needed one more run to tie.</p>
        <p>The Tigers' fans, many of them wearing dark blue University of Michigan jackets and hats on a brisk and breezy afternoon, chanted ''Sweep,'' and Brosius flied out to end the game. Jones pumped a finger into the air on the mound while Brosius peeled away the blacking from underneath his eyes and some of the Yankees lingered in their dugout for a few moments.</p>
        <p>''You'd be a moron to try to predict this,'' said Brad Ausmus, the Detroit catcher. ''I'm sure oddsmakers in Las Vegas didn't predict this.''</p>
        <p>The Tigers were 9-23 when this series began, and yet there were only a few moments when it seemed as if the Yankees might break through, when they might generate some offense.</p>
        <p>In the eighth inning today, Lance Johnson stepped to the plate as a pinch-hitter for Clay Bellinger and suddenly lights flashed on the concourse and alarms sounded.</p>
        <p>An automated announcement came through the public address system and reverberated throughout Comerica Park: ''All occupants walk to the nearest exit.''</p>
        <p>Fans looked around, searching for an emergency. Players in both dugouts looked up into the stands. Johnson stepped back from home plate, looked at Ausmus and Umpire Dana DeMuth, asking, ''What the heck was that?''</p>
        <p>Johnson stepped back in, drew three straight balls from Mlicki, and for an instant it seemed as if Johnson might get on base to start the rally that would ignite the Yankees, and the sounding of the alarm would be a turning point. But Mlicki threw two strikes, Johnson grounded out and the Yankees didn't score.</p>
        <p>The Comerica Park alarm was false. The Yankee Stadium alarms have not sounded yet.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>DEREK JETER went through a series of 15 slow jogs on the outfield warning track here Sunday, his first real physical activity since straining a  stomach muscle last Thursday. Manager JOE TORRE suggested that his shortstop might be able to start more strenuous workouts Tuesday, and return to the lineup in Cleveland next weekend, at the earliest. The Yankees have lost every game since Jeter was hurt. ''There's no doubt we miss Jeter,'' DAVID CONE said.</p>
