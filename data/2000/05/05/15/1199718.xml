        <p>Under pressure to accept more than $40 million a year each or face cancellation of their series, the stars of the NBC comedy ''Friends'' agreed yesterday to a deal that would bring the show back for two more seasons.</p>
        <p>The six stars of the show -- Lisa Kudrow, Courteney Cox Arquette, Jennifer Aniston, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry and Matt LeBlanc -- had demanded annual salaries of more than $1 million an episode, plus added profits from the show's sales in syndication. In the end, after what several executives involved in the talks described as complicated and occasionally frantic negotiations, the stars wound up accepting $750,000 an episode for the next two seasons of 24 episodes each, as well as a higher percentage of future profits in the show.</p>

        <p>Under pressure to accept more than $40 million a year each or face cancellation of their series, the stars of the NBC comedy ''Friends'' agreed yesterday to a deal that would bring the show back for two more seasons.</p>
        <p>The six stars of the show -- Lisa Kudrow, Courteney Cox Arquette, Jennifer Aniston, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry and Matt LeBlanc -- had demanded annual salaries of more than $1 million an episode, plus added profits from the show's sales in syndication. In the end, after what several executives involved in the talks described as complicated and occasionally frantic negotiations, the stars wound up accepting $750,000 an episode for the next two seasons of 24 episodes each, as well as a higher percentage of future profits in the show.</p>
        <p>The deals will be worth more than $40 million a year for each of the stars, two executives involved in the negotiations said. Even though this represents a total far in excess of what any of the stars could possibly command to appear in movies, the deal came closer to not happening than anyone had expected.</p>
        <p>The stars' demands had pushed NBC and Warner Brothers, the studio that owns ''Friends,'' to threaten to drop what is now television's highest-rated comedy.</p>
        <p>NBC, which had to lock in a new fall prime-time schedule by last night in anticipation of a formal announcement to national advertisers today, told representatives of the stars that if a deal was not done by 3 p.m. yesterday, ''Friends'' would be canceled. The network reinforced the point by telling the stars it was preparing a series of promotions to play during NBC shows Sunday that would have identified next Thursday's episode of ''Friends'' as the ''series finale.''</p>
        <p>''The pressure had to build before a deal could be done,'' said Peter Roth, the president of the Warner Brothers television studio, a unit of Time Warner. The deal was finally completed at 3 a.m. yesterday, Mr. Roth said.</p>
        <p>He said it was in many ways typical of tough negotiations that need a deadline before they are resolved. But he added: ''There's no question that there was a period of time last week when things were really shaky. NBC was really clear that they would remove the show. They had a schedule with 'Just Shoot Me' in at 8 on Thursday.''</p>
        <p>Instead, ''Friends'' will stay there, at a price that will make it the most expensive half-hour in television history. Still, Mr. Roth said: ''NBC will make money. Everybody compromised in this; everyone got hurt a little. But everyone gets something good out of it.''</p>
        <p>As costly as the deal is, NBC, a unit of General Electric, escaped what would have been a near disastrous blow to its prime-time lineup. The network is announcing a schedule today that will be long on risks, with several new shows placed in challenging positions. NBC is adding seven new series and reducing its newsmagazine franchise, ''Dateline,'' from five editions a week to three. It is also moving its longtime hit comedy ''Frasier'' from Thursday at 9 back to Tuesday at 9, a move that was strenuously opposed by that show and its studio, Paramount.</p>
        <p>NBC's new schedule, with new shows in bold:</p>
        <p>Monday: ''Daddio,'' ''Third Rock From the Sun,'' ''Deadline'' and ''Third Watch.'' Tuesday: ''Michael Richards Show,'' ''Tucker,'' ''Frasier,'' ''D.A.G.'' and ''Dateline.'' Wednesday: ''Titans,'' ''The West Wing'' and ''Law and Order.'' Thursday: ''Friends,'' ''Cursed,'' ''Will and Grace,'' ''Just Shoot Me'' and ''E.R.'' Friday: ''Providence,'' ''Dateline'' and ''Law and Order: S.V.U.'' Saturday: Movies. Sunday: ''Dateline,'' ''Ed'' and movies.</p>
