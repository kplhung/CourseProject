        <p>It is not disabilities alone that ''can keep children from living independently, or ever having a social life or being able to function in society,'' as you quote a specialist as saying, but the social stigma and isolation a person with a disability faces in our society.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''As the Tiniest Babies Grow, So Can Their Problems'' (front page, May 8) makes some assumptions that potentially support a disturbing viewpoint.</p>
        <p>It is not disabilities alone that ''can keep children from living independently, or ever having a social life or being able to function in society,'' as you quote a specialist as saying, but the social stigma and isolation a person with a disability faces in our society.</p>
        <p>Withholding care promotes an ideology that life is not worth living for a person based on the fact that he or she has a disability, regardless of whether it is judged objectively, using medical criteria, to be ''severe.''</p>
        <p>Let's cherish life for what it is and start talking about people, not tragedies.</p>
        <p>CARL  HERR  Jamaica, Queens, May 8, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is a disability rights advocate at the Queens Independent Living Center.</p>
