      <block class="full_text">
        <p>One of Turkey's most influential political cartoonists lives in a most unlikely place: the affluent New York suburb of Scarsdale.</p>
        <p>From a converted bedroom in his family's comfortable two-story home, Salih Memecan, the cartoonist for Sabah, one of Turkey's largest newspapers, sends forth a stream of daily cartoons that use deft humor to skewer the politicians and politics of his native country seven time zones away.</p>
        <p>Mr. Memecan moved here 18 months ago. Rather than leaving him stranded and out of touch with Turkish affairs, as friends in Istanbul had feared, he said the distance has given him better insight into the economic and political transformations sweeping Turkey as the country struggles toward a stable free-market democracy.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if my cartoons are better, but they feel fresher,'' Mr. Memecan said.</p>
        <p>Political journalism is serious business in Turkey. For most of modern Turkey's 77-year history, the role of the press has been largely to buttress the government. Laws prohibit defaming Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, founder of the republic, or advocating a religious alternative to the devoutly secular government. At least 18 journalists, most affiliated with Kurdish publications, are in Turkish prisons for running afoul of the laws, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, which monitors abuses against the press worldwide.</p>
        <p>Yet in recent years some restrictions have been eased and segments of the mainstream press, particularly a handful of influential newspaper columnists, have engaged in a robust debate on sensitive social and political topics, often criticizing the government sharply. One of the voices in that debate, usually from the left and always leavened with humor, has been that of Mr. Memecan, 47.</p>
        <p>Gaining a broader perspective on Turkish politics was only one reason Mr. Memecan said he chose to move to the United States, where he earned a doctorate in architecture as a Fulbright scholar in the early 1980's at the University of Pennsylvania. In addition, he said, he had worried that his work was simply getting stale.</p>
        <p>''I saw the same people, watched the same TV channels and I was drawing similar cartoons,'' Mr. Memecan said. ''I like my job and I like my paper. The only thing I could change was my location.''</p>
        <p>So, with the approval of his editors, he and his wife, Nursuna, moved to Scarsdale with their two children, Mehmet, 16, and Zeynep, 11. Things have gone so smoothly that Mr. Memecan has not missed a day's cartooning.</p>
        <p>The Internet has enabled Mr. Memecan not only to file his work on time, but to maintain his essential contact with Turkey. Each night, beginning shortly before midnight because of the time difference, Mr. Memecan reads six or seven Turkish newspapers online, culling them for ideas for the next day's cartoons before he goes to bed. He also receives Turkish television via a satellite dish.</p>
        <p>Six days a week, Mr. Memecan gets up in the morning and produces a political cartoon strip for the front page of Sabah and a humor strip for the back page. Five days a week, he also creates a 30-second animated cartoon for the publishing company's television news show. In addition, he draws a front-page political cartoon each Sunday and produces another political cartoon for a magazine.</p>
        <p>He draws the cartoons with black ink on white paper and scans them into his computer, a Macintosh G3. He adds his trademark bright colors on the computer and then sends the cartoons via e-mail to the newspaper in Istanbul. He is usually a couple of days ahead on the strip for the back page, but his front-page cartoon is always the last item in the paper.</p>
        <p>He has several backup systems in case his e-mail server is down. Only once has everything crashed, and still he managed to make the deadline. Over the telephone, he guided a staff artist at the paper through drawing the day's political strip.</p>
        <p>Political cartoons in the hands of Mr. Memecan are more funny than biting. His views lean to the left and he is a strong advocate of human rights. He says his goal is to make people smile as they ponder any given situation.</p>
        <p>In one recent cartoon, he poked fun at Turkey's long-awaited candidacy to join the European Union. Standing beside an aircraft marked European Union, a man representing Turkey struggled with his bags -- one marked economy; another, Cyprus; and a third, human rights.</p>
        <p>In another commentary, on the sensitive issue of devout Muslim women's wearing of scarves in public places, two young girls tried to get into school by covering their scarves with baseball caps adorned with pictures of Ataturk.</p>
        <p>''Instead of imposing my opinion,'' Mr. Memecan said, ''I try to reveal the different sides of a political situation, including the lighter side.''</p>
        <p>The front-page political strip is called ''Bizim city,'' which translates as ''Our City.'' The town in the strip is out of the American Wild West. The sheriff resembles Turkey's prime minister, Bulent Ecevit, and the mayor looks a lot like the country's departing president, Suleyman Demirel. The antics are reminiscent of ''Doonesbury.''</p>
        <p>The strip on the back page is a sort of Turkish version of ''Peanuts,'' called ''Sizinkiler,'' or roughly ''common folk.'' A family of chickens proceeds through life with humor, if little grace. The strip is especially popular with children, and Mrs. Memecan has created a publishing company to market anthologies.</p>
        <p>Erika Gilson, a professor of Turkish at Princeton University, uses Mr. Memecan's cartoons to teach basic Turkish to her students and, for advanced students, to stimulate discussion of social and political issues in Turkey. ''He is very observant and perceptive,'' she said. ''However, compared to some others, his political cartoons, even though they hit their mark, are somewhat gentle. One has the feeling that he is not out to destroy, but rather to show the irony, frailty or improbability of a situation.''</p>
