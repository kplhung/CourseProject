        <p>Timothy M. Kiley, who directed some of the leading television variety shows of the 1960's and 70's, died on April 29 at a hospital in Beverly Hills, Calif. He was 74.</p>
        <p>The cause was complications from lung cancer, his son Timothy said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kiley directed ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' in the 1960's, when the Beatles made their groundbreaking appearances and the Rolling Stones were introduced in America. He followed up with ''The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour'' and ''The Flip Wilson Show,'' for which he was nominated for three Emmy Awards.  He received the Directors Guild award for best director of a musical variety series in 1971. He also directed ''The Sonny and Cher Show,'' ''The Mac Davis Show'' and ''Star Search''; ceremonies for the Emmy, American Music and Country Music Awards; and specials starring Bob Hope and Frank Sinatra.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kiley was born Milwaukee. During World War II he was a sergeant serving in Europe and the Pacific. After the war he attended Northwestern University before working in Memphis and joining CBS in New York.</p>
        <p>In addition to his son, of Thousand Oaks, Calif., he is survived by another son, Christopher, of Los Angeles; three daughters, Laura and Patricia, of Los Angeles, and Susan, of Park Ridge, N.J.; a brother, William, of Redlands, Calif.; two sisters, Mary King of Seattle and Shaila Bolger of Midland Center, Wis.; and eight grandchildren.</p>
