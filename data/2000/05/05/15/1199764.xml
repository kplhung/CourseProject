        <p>The surge of energy was palpable yesterday as hundreds of thousands of marchers gathered on the Mall in Washington to demand stiffer gun control measures -- and additional crowds joined in the demonstration at other sites around the country. The event may not have reached the ''million mom'' goal set by some alliteration-loving promoters, but the turnout -- estimated at more than 750,000 by the organizers -- was nonetheless impressive, especially on a day traditionally devoted to family gatherings. There is real hope that the seed planted by this march could blossom into a movement that could change the dynamics of the national struggle to achieve sensible gun control.</p>
        <p>That possibility clearly has the National Rifle Association running scared. It tried to neutralize the impact of the march in advance with advertisements in print and broadcast media denigrating the event and offering its own tepid alternative, a program to teach gun safety in every elementary school classroom in America. A full-page N.R.A. ad in The Times on Friday derided the march as ''a political agenda masquerading as motherhood'' and called it ''shameful to seize a cherished holiday for political advantage.'' That seemed a disingenuous complaint from an organization that regularly uses its lavish campaign contributions to seize the political process and thwart the will of the American people.</p>

        <p>The surge of energy was palpable yesterday as hundreds of thousands of marchers gathered on the Mall in Washington to demand stiffer gun control measures -- and additional crowds joined in the demonstration at other sites around the country. The event may not have reached the ''million mom'' goal set by some alliteration-loving promoters, but the turnout -- estimated at more than 750,000 by the organizers -- was nonetheless impressive, especially on a day traditionally devoted to family gatherings. There is real hope that the seed planted by this march could blossom into a movement that could change the dynamics of the national struggle to achieve sensible gun control.</p>
        <p>That possibility clearly has the National Rifle Association running scared. It tried to neutralize the impact of the march in advance with advertisements in print and broadcast media denigrating the event and offering its own tepid alternative, a program to teach gun safety in every elementary school classroom in America. A full-page N.R.A. ad in The Times on Friday derided the march as ''a political agenda masquerading as motherhood'' and called it ''shameful to seize a cherished holiday for political advantage.'' That seemed a disingenuous complaint from an organization that regularly uses its lavish campaign contributions to seize the political process and thwart the will of the American people.</p>
        <p>The marchers offered a sound agenda, ranging from the registration of all handguns and the licensing of all handgun owners to mandatory safety locks and full background checks before all gun sales. By contrast, the solutions offered by the N.R.A. were laughably insufficient -- safety education in the elementary schools, better parenting and better enforcement of existing laws, riddled as they are with loopholes. Those are all laudable goals but would not come close to stemming the epidemic of gun violence.</p>
        <p>Even worse ideas came from some participants in a countermarch staged by gun advocates. They argued for the arming of teachers and other citizens and the right to carry concealed weapons on the theory that if more of the ''good'' people owned guns for self-protection, the ''bad'' people would be deterred from attacking them. That sounded more like a recipe for shootouts than for crime control.</p>
        <p>It is not yet clear how the gun control issue will play out politically. Even as the mothers were mobilizing for their march, a new poll showed that the gender gap on guns is growing, with men more apt to support the rights of gun owners and women more interested in gun restrictions. The challenge for the marchers will be to turn the event into a sustained political movement. Many speakers hailed this as a historic turning point in the gun control struggle, but it will only become so if the marchers keep up the pressure -- on Congress to pass the modest but useful gun control measures that remain blocked in a conference committee, and on candidates running in the fall elections to support strict gun control laws. The hands that rock the nation's cradles have the potential to rock its political institutions -- but only if they keep rocking hard.</p>
