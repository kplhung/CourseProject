      <abstract>
        <p>Letter from John Schrecker says unexamined factor in rise of crime from mid-1960's to mid-70's and in its current decline is Vietnam War; says waging unjust and divisive war bred nihilism and moral breakdown, and decline in crime now is sign that nation is emerging from that great trauma</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A striking and generally unexamined factor in the rise of crime from the mid-1960's to the mid-70's and in its current decline (news article, May 8) is the Vietnam War.</p>
        <p>The war was the determinant factor in American life precisely during these 10 years, when so many of the past generation's problems took off: from the rise in crime to the epidemic divorce rate, from the drug culture to the decline of America's cities. Not only does the periodization (as historians would call it) of these issues parallel our involvement in Vietnam, but such broad negative effects are also just what one would expect in a country that, for a decade, waged an unjust and divisive war that bred nihilism and moral breakdown.</p>
