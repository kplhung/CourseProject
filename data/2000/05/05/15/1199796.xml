        <p>On the verge of reaching a final decision about his campaign for the Senate, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani found himself confronting an array of conflicting advice yesterday from his advisers, some of whom have financial, political and career interests riding on whether he stays in the race.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani is expected to announce his plans as soon as today, in the face of pressure from Republicans concerned that his decision to cancel campaign events signaled his exit from the contest against Hillary Rodham Clinton. Yet as Mr. Giuliani struggles to unravel the tangled medical, political and personal considerations, he is turning to City Hall aides, campaign advisers and personal friends whose agendas are not necessarily topped by concerns about his health, personal problems and future political viability.</p>
        <p>For example, members of Mr. Giuliani's paid campaign staff, most of whom are urging him to stay in, face the loss of their extraordinarily high public profiles, and potentially high fees, if the mayor skips the race.</p>
        <p>At City Hall, aides are faced with the prospect of losing their jobs -- or taking less influential positions in  Washington -- should Mr. Giuliani win, while Mr. Giuliani's personal friends will lose the status and influence that comes with being able to boast of having a mayor as a buddy.</p>
        <p>The chairman of the state Liberal Party, Raymond B. Harding, would be freed from a political vise if his close friend skipped the Senate race. Then he could steer the Liberal Party behind the Democratic team of Al Gore and Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>And the chairman of the state Republican Party, William D. Powers, who has been urging Mr. Giuliani to stay the course, was described yesterday as increasingly worried that his party could lose control of the State Senate this fall if Mr. Giuliani was not on the top of the ticket.</p>
        <p>This swirl of conflicting pressures, several of Mr. Giuliani's advisers said yesterday, has meant that the mayor has been unable to take almost any advice at face value these last few days. And it has added a new level of complexity to what was already a difficult moment in his life: deciding his political future in the midst of a prostate cancer diagnosis and the breakup of his marriage.</p>
        <p>''There's an enormous amount of that going on,'' one of Mr. Giuliani's closest friends said yesterday. ''People are advising him for their own personal agenda.''</p>
        <p>After seven years in City Hall, Mr. Giuliani is accustomed to palace intrigue. But his unexpected deluge of difficulties, in combination with what has emerged as a once-in-a-lifetime career opportunity for so many people in his circles, has resulted in an unusually pitched atmosphere of mistrust in Mr. Giuliani's quarters.</p>
        <p>The mayor's aides have, over the last 48 hours, variously accused other people of leaking stories to try to push the mayor one way or another in his deliberations, or raised questions about the motivations of others in his circle.</p>
        <p>''The thing that has been very depressing has been the number of anonymous sources professing to know his mind and his heart,'' one of the mayor's associates said yesterday, ''and then expressing that knowledge in an anonymous manner, to try to move the decision one way or another, or just to finality.''</p>
        <p>At Gracie Mansion last night, Mr. Giuliani said he was still considering options for cancer treatment, as well as whether he would stay in the Senate race. He said that an article in this week's Newsweek, asserting that Mr. Giuliani had decided to undergo both surgery and radiation treatment and had all but decided to quit the Senate race, was ''a lie.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's advisers agreed to discuss the complications that have clouded the decision-making process on the condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>But some of the inside discussions with the mayor have at times slipped out. A number of the people who would like Mr. Giuliani to run -- and would benefit professionally if he did -- have advised him privately that he would suffer perhaps irreparable damage with the Republican Party if he pulled out now. Some advisers have also suggested to reporters that they write stories exploring those same themes, presumably to dramatize the point to Mr. Giuliani while he weighs his options.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani has held a series of meetings with aides to discuss his future these last few days. For the most part, one adviser said, the mayor has listened to the advice without making comments, and his silence has fed a flow of speculation that has engulfed the mayor's anxious staff.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's advisers have split into three groups: his campaign aides, his City Hall staff and his personal friends, or kitchen cabinet.</p>
        <p>The conflicting loyalties of Mr. Giuliani's campaign staff have been the most apparent. Adam Goodman, his media consultant, has urged him to stay in the race, assuming his health is up to it, as has his pollster, Frank Luntz, and his campaign manager, Bruce J. Teitelbaum.</p>
        <p>The political skills of all three men are well respected. That said, all three have a great deal riding on Mr. Giuliani's staying in the race, including instant celebrity that comes with being associated with a race that is receiving international coverage, to the inevitable enhancement of their long-term career prospects if they guide Mr. Giuliani to victory. (Mr. Teitelbaum has seemingly enjoyed his jump from obscure mayoral chief of staff to regular guest on the Sunday morning talk shows.)</p>
        <p>There are immediate financial benefits as well, particularly for Mr. Goodman, the Florida-based media consultant. He is the producer of Mr. Giuliani's television spots, and in a race that is expected to be this expensive and media-driven, he stands to reap a huge amount of fees if the mayor proceeds.</p>
        <p>Among advisers not directly affiliated with the campaign, Mr. Harding has signaled to Mr. Giuliani that he thinks it might be best for the mayor if he did not run. He has been in a difficult situation from the moment Mr. Giuliani said he wanted the Liberal Party's support. Mr. Harding has seemed inclined to accede to Mr. Giuliani's request, though it could come with a high cost, since Mr. Gore has said he might not take the Liberal Party endorsement if the party backed Mr. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>In addition, if Mr. Giuliani backed out, it would be a big lift to the mayoral candidate Mr. Harding is likely to support, Alan G. Hevesi, the city comptroller. That is because if Mr. Giuliani wins, he will be succeeded by Mark J. Green, the public advocate, which would give him the advantage of incumbency in any battle with Mr. Hevesi for the Democratic mayoral nomination.</p>
        <p>One person involved in the deliberations said that Mr. Harding signaled that he was about to offer advice that might not necessarily be in his best interest by saying: ''O.K., now I'm putting on my L.P. hat.'' The abbreviation refers to the Liberal Party.</p>
        <p>The crucial people in Mr. Giuliani's City Hall circles, in particular Joseph J. Lhota, the deputy mayor for operations, are said to have advised Mr. Giuliani to stay in the race. However, there is some tension between Mr. Giuliani's campaign staff and his City Hall staff, with some of the mayor's political advisers saying they suspect that his City Hall aides are pushing him to quit the race to ensure their own continuing employment and influence in City Hall.</p>
        <p>Finally, there is Mr. Giuliani's so-called kitchen cabinet, which includes Peter Powers, his longtime friend; Elliot Cuker, an acting coach and car dealership owner; and Randy L. Levine, a former deputy mayor. Mr. Levine is said to have advised Mr. Giuliani to run if he can. But Mr. Cuker and Mr. Powers, who are considered among his two closest friends, are said to have pressed him to skip the race for Senate, all the more so in light of his diagnosis.</p>
