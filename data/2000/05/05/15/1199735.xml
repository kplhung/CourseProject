        <p>Dr. Barry Louis Sherman, director of the George Foster Peabody Awards for television programs at the University of Georgia, died on May 2 after collapsing in a lunchtime basketball game on the Athens campus. He was 47.</p>
        <p>The cause was a heart attack, the university said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sherman, who lived in Athens,  was a professor of telecommunications at the university's Grady College of Journalism and Mass Communication, which administers the awards for achievements in broadcasting and cable television. He had directed the program since 1991.</p>
        <p>He was preparing for the 59th annual Peabody ceremony, set for the Waldorf-Astoria in Manhattan on May 22.</p>
        <p>This year, there were 1,200 entries for the awards, named after a Georgia banker and philanthropist. Thirty-six winners for programs broadcast in 1999 were announced in Athens in late March.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sherman joined the Grady College faculty in 1981 after teaching at Western Michigan University and Pennsylvania State University.</p>
        <p>A New York native, he graduated in 1974 from Queens College, City University of New York, where he also received a master's degree in 1975. He earned a Ph.D. in speech communications from Penn State in 1979.</p>
        <p>Dr. Sherman is survived by his wife, Candice Maller Sherman, assistant director of student activities on the Athens campus; two children, Jessica and Eric; and his father, Harold, and two sisters, Helene and Natalie, all of New York City.</p>
