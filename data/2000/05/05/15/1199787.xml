        <p>One of the top American commanders in the  Persian Gulf war came under inves tigation in 1991 after a member of his  unit complained that his troops had  pummeled retreating Iraqi forces in  an unprovoked attack two days after  a cease-fire went into effect.</p>
        <p>Military investigators, who fielded  the anonymous complaint and com pleted a secret report in 1991, exoner ated Barry R. McCaffrey, now a re tired four-star Army general and  President Clinton's top drug control  official. But questions about the at tack have been revived by a report  appearing in The New Yorker maga zine on Monday that quotes senior  Army officers, including one of the  top officers on General McCaffrey's  staff, as saying the attack was unjus tified.</p>
        <p>Patrick Lamar, the operations of ficer of General McCaffrey's divi sion, told the magazine that the at tack was a ''giant hoax'' in which  overwhelming firepower was used  against an Iraqi armored force that  put up little resistance.</p>
        <p>The article by Seymour M. Hersh  pits a tenacious investigative report er against one of the nation's most  aggressive military men.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hersh first made his name by  reporting on the massacre of Viet namese civilians by Americans in  the hamlet of My Lai. His 25,000- word article on General McCaffrey  is the longest The New Yorker has  published since 1993.</p>
        <p>In addition to challenging General  McCaffrey's conduct, Mr. Hersh also  asserts that some of the command er's troops fired on Iraqi prisoners.  And he questions the integrity of the  military's investigations of this and  other allegations of gulf war miscon duct, charging that critics were often  either ignored or intimidated.</p>
        <p>But General McCaffrey insists  that he has been the victim of a  journalistic attack. He says Mr.  Hersh pursued him for months and  tried unsuccessfully to prove that he  had committed felonies during his  service in Vietnam and had stolen a  bicycle as a child.</p>
        <p>And in recent weeks, General  McCaffrey has mounted a pre-emp tive campaign to make Mr. Hersh  the issue, distributing letters to re porters by military officers com plaining of Mr. Hersh's tactics, and  directing journalists to the Army's  in-house investigation, which con cluded that the attack was provoked  by the Iraqis and was within the  cease-fire rules of engagement.</p>
        <p>''I have been dealing with the  press for years, but nothing prepared  me for this,'' General McCaffrey  said in an interview.</p>
        <p>General McCaffrey has long had a  reputation as an ambitious com mander. He was badly wounded in  Vietnam, but that did not shake his  confidence or ardor for battle.</p>
        <p>As allied troops prepared to battle  the Iraqis, General McCaffrey was in  command of the Army's 24th Infan try Division, which had been com manded by H. Norman Schwarzkopf,  the former gulf war commander, and  which consisted of 26,000 soldiers and  8,600 vehicles.</p>
        <p>The task of General McCaffrey's  division was to take the fight to  Iraq's Republican Guard. Unlike  some of his fellow Army command ers, who methodically and cautiously  maneuvered their units on the battle field, General McCaffrey had his sol diers race through southern Iraq,  and they were on the verge of cutting  off many of the Iraqi forces when  President Bush announced that a  cease-fire would take place after 100  hours of ground combat.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hersh's article makes several  allegations. One of the most sensa tional is that on Feb. 27, 1991, a unit of  armored vehicles within General  McCaffrey's division fired high- powered machine guns into a group  of more than 350 disarmed Iraqi  prisoners. General McCaffrey was  not personally implicated in the epi sode, although Mr. Hersh suggests  the general set a tone that encour aged use of excessive firepower.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hersh cites a tape of radio  conversations during the episode  that shows soldiers were horrified by  what is portrayed as a panicky blun der by trigger-happy troops.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Hersh, the Amer ican captors piled the prisoners' con fiscated weapons into a truck, drove  it into the desert, and blew it up. The  spectacular explosion apparently ex cited the drivers of nearby American  fighting vehicles, who rolled to the  scene and began blazing away with  their machine guns.</p>
        <p>''Why are we shooting at these  people, when they are not shooting  us?'' one soldier asked on the tape  cited by The New Yorker. ''It's mur der,'' someone else said on the tape.</p>
        <p>General McCaffrey said that the  soldier who made the tape was leav ing the scene in a Humvee at the  time and did not actually see what  the armored vehicles were firing at.  He said a subsequent Army investi gation determined that not a single  Iraqi prisoner was killed or injured.</p>
        <p>General McCaffrey's decisions im mediately after the 1991 Persian  Gulf war have long been the subject  of debate. After a cease-fire was  announced, an Iraqi unit trying to  retreat stumbled into General  McCaffrey's division, and there was  an exchange of fire.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of armored vehicles and  trucks were destroyed in the fight,  and General McCaffrey told Cable  News Network soon after the battle  that he believed 400 Iraqis has been  killed.</p>
        <p>Some Army officers complained  after the war that General McCaf frey had used the episode as an ex cuse to pummel the Iraqis in one of  the most one-sided fights of the war.  The chief operations officer of the  Army's VII Corps, for example, de clared that rules of engagement fol lowed by his forces would have pre cluded such an attack.</p>
        <p>The dispute has been explored in  several books, and was the subject of  a 1991 investigation by the Army's  Criminal Investigation Command.  The investigation cleared the gen eral, and he has cited it this past  week in his defense. Mr. Hersh's  account, however, suggests for the  first time that the discomfort over  the attack on March 2, 1991, also ran  deep within General McCaffrey's  own 24th Infantry Division, citing  comments by his operations officer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hersh's interpretation of the  fight is sharply contested by General  McCaffrey. Mr. Hersh suggests that  General McCaffrey deliberately pro voked the fighting by deploying his  troops in front of a causeway over  Lake Hammar and, thus, along a  likely Iraqi retreat route.</p>
        <p>He also quotes officers as saying  that many of the Iraqi tanks were  being carried by trucks and that  their turrets were turned to the rear;</p>
        <p>that the initial shots from the Iraqi  side were not a real attack but a sign  of panic upon encountering the  Americans blocking their retreat;</p>
        <p>and that McCaffrey ordered addi tional waves of assault long after any  sign of resistance from the Iraqis.</p>
        <p>''There was no need to be shooting  at anybody,'' Lt. Gen. James H. John son Jr., who commanded the 82nd  Airborne, is quoted as saying. ''They  couldn't surrender fast enough. The  war was over.''</p>
        <p>General McCaffrey, however, in sisted that Mr. Hersh's account was  skewed. He said he moved his troops  up to a boundary decided by higher- level Army officers, who were over seeing the war from Saudi Arabia.</p>
        <p>And General McCaffrey added  that he had no reason to think his  units were astride an escape route  because he believed that the cause way had been destroyed by Ameri can warplanes. He also denied that  most of the Iraqi tanks had their  guns turned to the rear and insisted  that he carried out the attack to  protect his men.</p>
        <p>''This whole notion that the tanks  were up on trucks and that their guns  were all to the rear is bull,'' he said.  ''This was an armed unit moving  through the desert.''</p>
        <p>Gen. Gary Luck, retired, the com mander of the XVIII Airborne Corps  during the gulf war and General  McCaffrey's superior, said he went  to the battle scene immediately after  the fight and concluded that General  McCaffrey had acted appropriately.  ''I think it was a fair fight,'' he said.</p>
        <p>General McCaffrey has also re leased a letter by General Schwarz kopf to Mr. Hersh in which the allied  commander said he was not aware of  any impropriety in the attack.</p>
        <p>General McCaffrey has cited the  Army investigation in his defense.  The investigation has received scant  public attention until now. Leon Pa netta, a senior White House official  at the time of the general's appoint ment as President Clinton's top anti- drug man in 1996, told The New  Yorker that the Clinton administra tion was unaware of the investigation  back then.</p>
        <p>But Robert S. Weiner, spokesman  for General McCaffrey, says that the  existence of the investigation was not  a secret, and that it was known to the  Senate committee which confirmed  the general's appointment.</p>
        <p>The report into actions by General  McCaffrey's division in the gulf war  was 2,100 pages long, and based on  interviews with some 200 witnesses.</p>
        <p>The allegations about the March 2  attack did not apparently cloud Gen eral McCaffrey's career. After the  gulf war, he was promoted several  times, and served as the four-star  commander of American forces in  Latin America.</p>
        <p>For all the criticism in the New  Yorker account, General McCaffrey  said he was relieved that Mr. Hersh  had dropped many of his earlier alle gations. He said that as a result of  the episode he has gathered an array  of material on the Persian Gulf war,  and is planning to write his own book.</p>
