        <p>Until a 43-year-old Dutch software executive and self-described neophyte collector bid $135,805 last week for a painting on eBay, the online auction company, skeptics assumed that no one would spend real money for art over the Internet. Too risky. You can't see the work firsthand.</p>
        <p>Besides, there's no theater to sitting by yourself in front of a computer screen and clicking a mouse. And theater had become a big part of why people spent crazy sums for dubious paintings: the theater of the salesrooms, which helped to propel the auction house boom of recent decades.</p>
        <p>Starting in the 1970's auction houses capitalized on it, as did the media. Before then, old-money collectors worked often through private dealers, quietly. But new fortunes sought headlines in the media age. Buyers with freshly minted egos got swept up by the black-tie, pressure-cooker arena at Christie's and Sotheby's -- by the television cameras, the prospects of front-page articles and the associative luster of the contemporary art world -- and they bid prices for Julian Schnabels, Sandro Chias and Enzo Cucchis through the roof.</p>
        <p>These tyros were not just speculating in cultural junk bonds. They were paying for the satisfaction of being seen to buy art, something new. Owning art had always been about acquiring status, and starting in the 19th century it increasingly became a financial investment. But now the act of purchase, publicly done, was a commodity.</p>
        <p>Along comes Rob Keereweer of Nieuwkoop, the Netherlands. At the close of online bidding last Monday, he had offered $135,805 for what appeared over the Internet as an indistinct abstract painting, with the signature ''R.D. '52.'' As he tells it, the hook was that it might be by Richard Diebenkorn, the California painter. A Diebenkorn from 1955 had sold for $1.8 million at Sotheby's in 1998.</p>
        <p>The painting on eBay went up for auction at 25 cents. The seller used the Internet name ''golfpoorly.'' He was from Berkeley, Calif., he said. Diebenkorn lived in Berkeley.</p>
        <p>In addition to a photograph of the painting (incorrectly oriented vertically) he posted a story about having bought the picture at a garage sale a long time ago. His wife had not let him keep it in their house, so he was finally getting it out of the garage to please her. His son at one point had put a hole in it with his plastic tricycle, and you could see the hole in another close-up photograph, located so that the photograph conveniently included the signature, about which ''golfpoorly'' said nothing.</p>
        <p>He turned out to be Kenneth A. Walton, 32, single, a lawyer in Sacramento and online seller under various names, who had made up wife, tricycle and garage. EBay voided the sale, not because he had lied (this is virtual reality, after all), but because he had bid on the painting himself, a violation of eBay rules.</p>
        <p>Theater!</p>
        <p>Farce, to be precise, although farce of a different kind than takes place in the auction rooms. Mr. Walton seems to have borrowed a trick from the auction houses: underselling his hand.</p>
        <p>Every buyer wants to outsmart the marketplace. Vanity is a salesman's oldest friend. Who wouldn't be proud of himself for discovering a valuable painting that some guy with the poky handle of ''golfpoorly'' was offering for 25 cents? Call it reverse psychology.</p>
        <p>Online auction fraud is rampant. No surprise. EBay, which guarantees none of what it sells, tried to minimize the problem, saying fraud occurs in one-tenth of 1 percent of its auctions, which works out to 50,000 scams during the first three months of this year alone. Mr. Walton's made-up story and shill bid -- never mind whether the picture turns out to be by Diebenkorn -- makes this at least 50,001.</p>
        <p>Sotheby's says that it uses its customary controls and guarantees on its online sites. Better controls and guarantees are obviously needed, but notwithstanding them, online buyers probably still won't be more cautious after this debacle, maybe the reverse. A flush economy breeds innumerable fools ready to squander new fortunes, trading in start-ups when they aren't surfing for Michelangelos or at least Furbies on eBay.</p>
        <p>Skeptics who had doubted that people would buy expensive art online, which they couldn't see firsthand, hadn't factored in several things. People have long bought art they haven't seen for themselves, based on reproductions in auction catalogs, and there's no big difference between that and buying a painting on the basis of a reproduction on eBay, except that at least someone vetted the art for the catalogs before printing the pictures. The Internet is a free-for-all.</p>
        <p>The prospect that the Web is the world's biggest garage sale, still unregulated, may make it more, not less, attractive to fortune hunters who think that unrecognized treasures are to be found there, below the experts' radar screen, uncontrolled.</p>
        <p>This is the art world's version of the Wild West, after all. Smart money had it that only prints and photographs -- produced in multiple copies, therefore somewhat predictable -- would sell successfully on the Web. Actually the condition of prints and photographs varies, so that experienced collectors know they have to see them firsthand, too. But if Mr. Keereweer is as he seems, online buyers are neither experienced nor prudent, just aggressive.</p>
        <p>And we shouldn't underestimate the straightforward appeal of the democracy of the Web, attuned to a new age of prospective collectors. As the auction houses catered to 80's-style tycoons, eager to make a splash, so the Internet suits regular folks, even schleps, and the dot-com rich, less ostentatious, more technologically oriented. The auction houses seem elitist by comparison.</p>
        <p>Finally there's glamour. Sure, computers are geeky, but they're also cutting edge, and cutting edge is another term for avant-garde, which spells glamour. The glamour of any vanguard, by association, causes frogs to think they're princes. Blending art and technology makes a particularly potent cocktail for rubes.</p>
        <p>So who needs black-tie auctions and television cameras any longer? The 11-day unfolding sale of Mr. Walton's painting, accessible to anyone with a computer, was drama on a public level at least equivalent to what Christie's or Sotheby's can manage, weirdly captivating like a crash in slow motion.</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Keereweer in the Netherlands, just before the auction closed last Monday, he wrote to a reporter, by e-mail: ''I myself would like to concentrate on the auction right now. The final moment of the auction is in the middle of the night for me, and I need time to explain to my wife why I am bidding so much money on a painting that I have not seen in the flesh.''</p>
        <p>Assuming he actually has a wife, one suspects that the two of them had a nice long chat.</p>
