        <p>STORK CLUB  America's Most Famous Nightspot and the Lost World of Cafe Society  By Ralph Blumenthal  Illustrated. 296 pages. Little, Brown &amp; Company. $25.95.</p>
        <p>From the 1920's to the 1960's the Stork Club was a glittering fixture of New York night life. During its Depression heyday, Sherman Billingsley's club became a playground for celebrities from society, screen, radio and the rackets, and for the well-heeled who flocked to drink and dance in their aura. If not indisputably America's most famous nightspot, it was certainly in the front ranks of Cafe Society, whose effervescent goings-on (as reported in daily columns, glossy magazines and sophisticated Hollywood comedies) furnished material for the fantasy life of millions in that bleak era.</p>
        <p>In ''Stork Club'' Ralph Blumenthal has deftly recaptured its evanescent glamour. He evokes its convivial din: 'the rattling of ice in cocktail shakers, the pop of Champagne corks and the sudden blare of rhumba music'' and its ''air violet with pleasurably exhaled smoke,'' a haze punctuated by ''the flare of flicked lighters'' and ''roving photographers firing blinding barrages from silvery Speed Graphics.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Blumenthal, who reports on the arts for The New York Times, has dug up notes Billingsley made for a never-written autobiography; interviewed the proprietor's family, friends and former employees; and ransacked appropriate archives. His accumulated data give heft to what is in effect a twin biography, of the club and its owner-manager.</p>
        <p>There are times when Mr. Blumenthal seems in thrall to his sources, and the lengthy lists of celebrity attendees and ceaseless flow of family anecdotes and business arcana tell us more than we care or need to know. But his good-humored style keeps the story moving. His tight focus on Billingsley and his club does, however, emphasize description over analysis and circumscribe his investigation of ''The Lost World of Cafe Society.''</p>
        <p>''Cafe Society'' was a new kind of elite Manhattan socializing in which formerly reclusive upper-crust men and women began partying in public alongside entertainment celebrities, with the collective merriment sped to mass audiences by various media. Mr. Blumenthal dates the phenomenon's emergence to the early 1920's, when Billingsley arrived on the New York scene, and its passing to the 1960's, when he died. Arguably, however, there has been a series of Cafe Societies, beginning in the 1890's, when venturesome blue bloods and Broadway stars began stepping out to spectacular restaurants and naughty cabarets, their doings trumpeted by a hungry press.</p>
        <p>Prohibition wiped away this first generation of clubs and cabarets, and turned the entertainment business over to gangsters and bootleggers, providing Billingsley with his entrance cue. A man with impeccable criminal credentials, Mr. Blumenthal makes clear, this youthful Oklahoman had traveled around dry states, watering parched inhabitants with whiskey, until he landed in Leavenworth prison. When Prohibition went national, Billingsley moved to New York, failed to make it in the violent big leagues of bootlegging and settled for running one of the innumerable new gangster-backed speak-easies.</p>
        <p>The 1929 crash, in turn, swept away many of these second-wave nightspots, but the Stork Club hung on, partly thanks to mob connections but mainly because in 1930 the columnist Walter Winchell plugged it, in print and on radio, as ''New York's New Yorkiest place.'' Better yet, Winchell moved in as resident scribe and tout, guaranteeing a steady flow of customers and allowing Billingsley to catch the third wave in 1933, when repeal sent respectable nightlife surging.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blumenthal makes clear the grubby backstage reality behind the swanky front, notably Billingsley's provision of free food and drink to the columnists who served as shills, and to the well-born (or merely well-dressed) youths who served as bait. Blacks were distinctly unwelcome.</p>
        <p>Brilliantly successful through its wartime peak, the Stork began to lurch and wobble in the 1950's, before crashing to earth in the 1960's. Mr. Blumenthal suggests the problem was ''a growing distaste for the self-indulgence of a spoiled class.'' True enough, as far as it goes, but the passing of the club, and the top-hatted, high-heeled version of Cafe Society itself, seems insufficiently situated in the context of the times. What Mr. Blumenthal does demonstrate is how much of Billingsley's fall was of his own making.</p>
        <p>In the case of television, a general threat to all nightspots, Billingsley was at his most active, trying to ride the electronic wave lest he drown in it. He signed with CBS to do an interview program live from the Stork, but proved an awkward on-screen presence. The big beneficiaries of television were new clubs like the Blue Angel, whose daring comics or breakaway singers often wound up on the Ed Sullivan or Jack Paar shows. But Billingsley wasn't into novel entertainment forms.</p>
        <p>As Billingsley's cultural caution cost him, so did fallout from his racial, political, and economic stances. Mr. Blumenthal presents these as separate issues, but they might more advantageously be seen as linked conservatisms. The Stork's (and other nightspots') restrictive racial policies came under indirect assault when in 1938 a club in Greenwich Village, provocatively named Cafe Society, began courting black patrons as well as performers. Then in 1950, after an incident at the Stork involving Josephine Baker, the desegregation struggle came directly to Billingsley's doorstep, with N.A.A.C.P. pickets bearing signs reading ''Famous Nite Spot Just a White Spot.''</p>
        <p>The Stork's standing was not improved when Billingsley and the previously New Dealish Winchell made the club a haven for the Cold War right. J. Edgar Hoover had long been a Stork habitue (and to an amazing degree a fix-it man for his buddy Billingsley). Now the club played host to Joseph McCarthy and Roy Cohn (who struck up their chumship there) and got Billingsley involved in damaging wars with liberal media. Billingsley also fought a ferocious and losing battle against unionization -- with Cohn as his pugnacious lawyer -- a fight that cost him clients and cash, including his children's trust funds.</p>
        <p>Finally, with office buildings swallowing up the surrounding brownstones, Billingsley sold the Stork to CBS, who had it torn down and the site on East 53rd Street turned into a vest-pocket park. Billingsley died in 1966, a year after his club's demise. When the latest incarnation of Cafe Society took to the dance floor at Studio 54, he would not be around to join the party.</p>
