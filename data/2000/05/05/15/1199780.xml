        <p>Oh, sorry. Just taunting the Miami Heat's Alonzo Mourning.</p>

        <p>A-LON-zo, A-LON-zo, A-</p>
        <p>Oh, sorry. Just taunting the Miami Heat's Alonzo Mourning.</p>
        <p>O.K., it's juvenile. Childish, even. But it's extremely addictive, somewhat effective and absolutely necessary for the Knicks' finals hopes. For one, history says the more you get under Mourning's skin in the playoffs, the greater the chance Mount Zo will blow.</p>
        <p>It's ancient history, of course. About two years old. And anyone who watched Mourning smiling after he was disemboweled by the Knicks underneath the rim in the fourth quarter of Game 4 yesterday could clearly see a levelheaded veteran emerging from the ashes of an angry young man.</p>
        <p>But as in previous postseasons, Knicks-Heat IV is starting to wear on Mourning's patience. Or so Patrick Ewing prays. Beyond the entertainment value of watching this sculpted 6-foot-11-inch, 260-pound rock of a center play the villain so perfectly, Mourning's growing peeved and frustrated may be the only chance Jeff Van Gundy's team has of getting another rebound.</p>
        <p>Really, how many National Basketball Association players pour in 27 points, haul down 14 rebounds and afterward apologize for a bad game?</p>
        <p>''I have got to make plays,'' Mourning said afterward. ''I have got to put the ball in the hole. I missed free throws down the stretch. That is very unacceptable.''</p>
        <p>Mourning had a team-high nine turnovers, missed four foul shots in the final five minutes and personified his mistake-prone team during its 91-83 loss as the Knicks evened the Eastern Conference finals at 2-2. We could be reaching here, but it also sounded as if the stress of trying to overcome the Knicks and their legions was getting to him.</p>
        <p>Unprompted and almost out of the blue, he said: ''It is just -- it has been up and down for us; it is pretty much reminiscent of last year. I am, like, here we go again, win one game, lose one game. Why can't we get to a level of consistency? Why does it always, you know, come down to a dogfight game with these guys? Why can't we just pull away? You know what I'm saying?''</p>
        <p>We know, Zo. We empathize. No one wants to be the scourge of Manhattan for a few weeks every spring. But you're so good at it. The howling after a monster dunk. The scowling after a silly foul.</p>
        <p>And besides, as Shaq has come to understand, nobody loves Goliath -- least of all Gotham.</p>
        <p>Frothing New Yorkers do not want to hear how you're a caring father and husband, the man who toted his Mother's Day present to his wife, Tracy Wilson-Mourning, to the postgame news conference. With gofers at his disposal, Mourning shopped for the card and the gift himself.</p>
        <p>New Yorkers don't want to hear how you dined with Ewing last Monday and Tuesday night in Miami, shelling and savoring stone crabs with your Georgetown mentor and close friend. Pat Riley cried treason, but Mourning believes friendship and rivalry can be separated.</p>
        <p>All those charity drives each summer, the untold hours you spend with foster children? Immaterial for these zealots.</p>
        <p>They only want to see Menacing Zo, the player personally responsible for sending the Knicks' front line to Beth Israel Medical Center for further examination.</p>
        <p>With the Heat inching toward the Knicks in the final moments yesterday, Mourning absorbed his annual verbal abuse from the foam-rubber-waving throng underneath the basket at the Eighth Avenue end of Madison Square Garden. Whether that had anything to do with his meltdown at the line is debatable.</p>
        <p>But twice he had a chance to trim the Knicks' lead to 3 points in the final three minutes, and he could not do it from the foul line. He also had a heartbreak jump shot from the left wing spin out with 2 minutes 55 seconds remaining.</p>
        <p>''You got to make proper plays,'' he said. ''Missed some free throws, I missed some. Shot kind of rimmed and came out. That would have been like a 5-point turnaround right there.''</p>
        <p>Mourning made 11 of 19 shots for 27 of the quietest points he has had in the series. He picked up a silly fourth foul, jumping out at Ewing at the end of the third quarter, barely nicking Ewing's elbow.</p>
        <p>''Like I said, it is upsetting, you know, just to come to this point and to know that we have been down this road before, man, and just not -- just not -- break through somewhere,'' he said. ''We just haven't broke through. We haven't. Somewhere along the line we got to establish a level of consistency or else we are going to let this thing slip away.''</p>
        <p>Tightly wound and shaking his head, Mourning gathered himself and walked off the podium, toward the team bus for the flight back to Miami and Game 5 on Wednesday. Gone was the denigrating roar of the crowd, the pressure, at least for a while, of trying to backpack his team to another grueling victory.</p>
        <p>As Alonzo Mourning left the Garden yesterday, he had to know that the only true enemy he faced in this series was himself. The more he relaxes and plays -- and the less he internalizes each loss -- the better off the Heat will be.</p>
        <p>No amount of derisive chanting will change that. Too strong, too big and too good, it has become clear: only Zo can stop Zo.</p>
