        <p>The invasion of the network programmers begins in New York today with the start of ''up front week,'' an annual television industry ritual in which the year's new comedy and drama models will be unveiled, accompanied by parades of stars, promises of sure-fire entertainment and plenty of parties.</p>

        <p>The invasion of the network programmers begins in New York today with the start of ''up front week,'' an annual television industry ritual in which the year's new comedy and drama models will be unveiled, accompanied by parades of stars, promises of sure-fire entertainment and plenty of parties.</p>
        <p>At least some of the celebrating will be justified. After years of gloom and doom, the clouds circling network television parted this season, thanks to two factors: the ABC game show ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' which provided evidence that a network can still command the attention of much of the viewing audience on a regular basis; and a sizzling advertising marketplace that has seen more money spent on commercial time during network programs than ever before.</p>
        <p>Nor is the end of the sunny days immediately in sight. In a presidential year that promises an influx in political advertising, as well as the extra boost of a Summer Olympics, projections suggest the networks will be able to command rate increases of 15 percent or more for the new lineups of shows they will be avidly pitching to advertisers this week.</p>
        <p>''Millionaire'' will surely be leading the charge. That show, which as of late last week ABC was leaning toward expanding to four nights every week, is poised to shatter every previous record for revenue generated by a single show. Even according to conservative estimates by ABC's competitors, ''Millionaire'' will generate more than $400 million in profit for ABC next season. Other longtime television industry executives say the profits for ''Millionaire'' may eclipse $600 million. Entire networks have rarely made that much in profit.</p>
        <p>As good as the year has been, it has not exactly translated into a golden era for viewers. Aside from ''Millionaire,'' relatively few new programs have made it to a second season, much less qualified as outright hits. Indeed, advertising and network executives agree that the money the networks are making is not particularly linked to how well their schedules are doing.</p>
        <p>''Right now the marketplace and 'Millionaire' are providing a blanket to cover the programmers' mistakes,'' said Warren Littlefield, the longtime NBC program chief who now operates his own production company.</p>
        <p>Even with a number of worthy additions -- ''The West Wing'' on NBC, ''Judging Amy'' on CBS, ''Malcolm in the Middle'' on Fox -- the current television season has proved mostly a struggle for network programmers, with numerous longtime favorites heading for the sunset, leaving the  networks with gaping holes to fill. (All but ABC anyway, which fills most of its holes with more editions of ''Millionaire.'')</p>
        <p>The networks will begin the patchwork this week. NBC kicks off the new-show exhibitions with a presentation at Lincoln Center today. By Thursday night, six networks will have introduced between 30 and 40 new series to the television world.</p>
        <p>For advertisers with any memory, the new crop may not not look much different from last year's entries, which were replete with such offerings as ''Oh Grow Up'' (ABC),  ''Work With Me'' (CBS), ''The Mike O'Malley Show'' (NBC) and ''Manchester Prep'' (Fox). The latter show never got even one episode on the air before it was canceled, as all the others were eventually.</p>
        <p>Still, even with flops rampant, the six broadcast networks as a whole set a record this season for total advertising revenue, taking in about $16.8 billion. And they enter showcase week for next fall's programs fully expecting to be richly rewarded by advertisers for their efforts -- lackluster or not.</p>
        <p>Nobody in the advertising industry is about to disabuse the networks of this confidence.</p>
        <p>''This year was beyond strong,'' said Gene DeWitt, chairman of Optimedia International, a media buying firm. ''From the network point of view, it was phenomenal. People were raining bucks down on them.''</p>
        <p>The likelihood, Mr. DeWitt added, is that the take is only going to go up when the networks start booking commitments for the new lineups they will show to advertisers beginning today. According to a projection by Jack Myers, the chief executive of Myers Reports, a research firm that specializes in media, the four biggest networks, ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox, can expect at least a 15 percent increase in advance sales.</p>
        <p>Including the two smaller networks, UPN and WB, Mr. Myers projects the total network advertising take during the upfront sales to hit a new record of $7.5 billion this spring, up from $7 billion last year. The figures could go even higher, toward the $8 billion level, he said, because his original projection did not take into account the decision by cable networks to begin selling their commercials in advance of the networks. ''That may allow the networks to charge even more,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Not all of the boost in ad revenue is going to Regis. But the presence of ''Millionaire,'' which is hosted by Regis Philbin, has helped lift most network boats. The three oldest networks, ABC, CBS and NBC, have seen their combined rating rise by about 0.4 rating point this season. The year before, those three networks saw their combined rating fall 2.2 rating points.</p>
        <p>Mr. Myers projects ABC's sales gains to be biggest, at 17 percent, but he puts Fox, a network that has suffered steep ratings declines all season, at a 16 percent increase, with NBC and CBS, both down slightly for the season, at 14 percent each.</p>
        <p>''You would think somebody would begin to notice that the networks are being rewarded for not doing their jobs,'' said one longtime network program executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>The falloff has been noticed; but it has not made any difference. Even with the paucity of hits beyond ''Millionaire,'' demand from advertisers has been so great that virtually any available network commercial slot has been snapped up. One big factor in the surge in demand has been, as Mr. DeWitt put it, ''The coming of the high-tech advertisers, who have lots of bucks to throw around.''</p>
        <p>Innumerable dot-com start-ups sought instant recognition by buying up commercial time on network television in the season ending this month. That provided two benefits. It was new advertising money, and it also tightened the number of spots available to sell to other advertisers, which pushed up the prices.</p>
        <p>Indeed, despite the growing conviction that the weekly series format of network television is a dying form, soon to replaced by an even greater multiplicity of choices through the digitalization of channels, personalized menus of programs and interactive formats for both shows and commercials, most advertisers still view network television as pre-eminent. ''It's still the engine that drives the media train,'' Mr. Myers said.</p>
        <p>But most of the popular shows are not particularly new. ''E.R.'' has been on seven years, and NBC just made a deal to keep it on another three. ''Law and Order'' has been on 10 years, and NBC just made a deal to keep it on another five.</p>
        <p>Not every projection sees the current gold rush continuing for the networks, especially if they fail to pull more ''Millionaires'' out of their hats. Some wonder if the cooling of technology stocks on Wall Street will lead to a shutoff in the spigot of money flowing in from the dot-com businesses.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeWitt suggested that a greater threat, however, would be a serious downturn in the national economy. He also noted that a serious failure in any of the schedules the networks announce this week will eventually prove costly because of ratings point guarantees made to advertisers. If they do not reach those guarantees, the networks will be forced to offer free commercials to make up the difference.</p>
        <p>''We aren't all completely nuts,'' Mr. DeWitt said. ''Obviously there's a cost-benefit line that hasn't been crossed.''</p>
        <p>But for the moment, he said, demand for commercial time is not slackening.</p>
        <p>''Advertisers are obviously feeling they're getting value from network television,'' he said. ''Unless something truly cataclysmic happens to the economy, I don't see that changing any time soon.''</p>
