        <p>United Against Outside Interference  If Microsoft worries the government, then what about the giant that will be created by the merger of America Online and Time Warner?

        <p>A Turkish Cartoonist Far From Home  From the New York suburb of Scarsdale, Salih Memecan, the political cartoonist for Sabah, one of Turkey's largest newspapers, sends forth a stream of daily cartoons that use deft humor to skewer the politicians and politics of his native country seven time zones away.
