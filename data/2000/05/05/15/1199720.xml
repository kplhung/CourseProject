        <p>Last Thursday night, Norman Pearlstine, the editor in chief of Time Inc., boogied to the sounds of Barenaked Ladies, the Canadian pop group, at a party at San Francisco's Pacific Bell Stadium.</p>
        <p>The occasion was an invitation-only party for a 1,000 guests to introduce Time Inc.'s E-Company Now, an offshoot of Fortune magazine that will focus on the Internet economy.</p>
        <p>The party was supposed to mark the first time that executives from Time Warner and America Online celebrated the birth of a Time Inc. magazine together. And the gala took place far from Time Warner's New York headquarters, in a city more closely linked with the new-media culture that America Online so embodies. Gerald M. Levin, chairman of Time Warner, and Don Logan, chief executive of Time Inc., joined Mr. Pearlstine. Stephen M. Case, chairman of America Online, was supposed to attend, but could not get away from the East Coast. He sent remarks along by videotape.</p>
        <p>Which raises the inevitable question: can the current executives of Time Warner and America Online all boogie to the same corporate tune?</p>
        <p>That question was addressed, at least for the moment, last week, when the two companies released an organization chart with a mother lode of corporate turf under the name of Robert W. Pittman, an America Online executive and the designated co-chief operating officer of the new company, to whom Mr. Logan and his magazine division, pushed farther down the food chain, will now report.</p>
        <p>And within the last six weeks, Mr. Pearlstine has seemingly answered questions about his own immediate future. A year ago, it was widely believed inside Time Inc. that he would leave the job of editor in chief at the end of 2000, a belief that led to an internal guessing game about whether John Huey, managing editor of Fortune, or Walter Isaacson, managing editor of Time magazine, was more likely to take his job.</p>
        <p>But the 57-year-old Mr. Pearlstine has renegotiated his contract and in an interview last week said he would stay at the company for at least another three years.</p>
        <p>Still, the corporate tinkering may be far from over. Two senior Time Inc. executives said last week that an editorial job might be created above Mr. Pearlstine's, a sort of AOL Time Warner uber-editor who  would oversee -- and try to create synergies between -- the journalistic activities at Time Warner and America Online. In this scenario, one person would supervise the journalistic work of CNN, Time Inc. and America Online.</p>
        <p>The notion of an editor in chief for the integrated company would please both Mr. Case and Mr. Levin, who have discussed the notion, the executives said. Both men are determined to show an integrated company to Wall Street -- and Time Warner has never been perceived as particularly well integrated by the business community. And Mr. Levin, the Time Inc. executives said, has not been excessively pleased with the level of synergy within his own company, particularly between Time Inc. and CNN.</p>
        <p>Peter Costiglio, a spokesman for Time Inc., said no plans had been made for the editorial czar position. But with Mr. Pittman now overseeing subscription and advertising sales not only at Time Inc. but for other Time Warner and AOL divisions as well, some believe it might make sense to have an executive with the same breadth of editorial responsibility reporting to him. If the position is created, it will not be happen before the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Or, as another Time Inc. executive, put it: ''Until the merger is done, you never know how things will play out.''</p>
        <p>America Online has long argued that the separation of editorial church and commercial state does not jibe with the new-media concept that success comes from the integration of commerce and content.</p>
        <p>But does it make sense to alter a magazine division that is thriving so mightily? Time Inc. -- a division that includes both magazines and book publishing -- took in $4.6 billion in revenue in 1999, according to the company's annual report, up from $4.4 billion in 1998. The magazines the division publishes range from the outrageous puffery of In Style and Teen People to the authoritative business coverage of Fortune magazine. (Only 6 percent of the division's revenue was attributable to book publishing, according to industry estimates.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Pearlstine, at a conference sponsored by the Industry Standard and New York magazines two weeks ago, said he was less worried about interference from America Online on the editorial front than about the internal distribution of corporate resources. How does one convince Wall Street, he asked, that investing in a new magazine is better than say, expanding a cable system?</p>
        <p>Of course, there are more pressing concerns for Mr. Pearlstine. As Time Warner is absorbed into America Online, there is a question within the company about whether Time Inc. magazines will receive special treatment from America Online and whether America Online might even get preferential treatment in the pages of Time magazines -- which have so far in fact gone out of their way to cover Time Warner and America Online with a brusque and sometimes biting fairness. (Time magazine clearly portrayed Time Warner as the loser in the company's public relations battle with the Walt Disney Company over the Time Warner cable blackout of ABC two weeks ago.)</p>
        <p>And there is some minor turbulence within the magazine division: Real Simple, the new magazine for women from Time Inc.'s immensely successful People division, has met with disappointment both on the newsstand and within the company. Last week, Henry Muller, Time Inc.'s editorial director for seven years, gave up that position to become an editor at large. At the same time, Isolde Motley -- the former managing editor of Life, which was closed last month -- was named corporate editor. But no replacement was named for the editorial director position Mr. Muller left behind.</p>
        <p>In an interview last week, Mr. Pearlstine addressed the issue of editorial independence -- which has been assured to him from all angles, he said -- and whether or not Time Inc. magazines would receive preferential treatment on America Online.</p>
        <p>''From a distance, you might say, 'Why do this merger if you don't do that?' '' Mr. Pearlstine asked. ''But I think it winds up being more an issue of right of first refusal. If it makes sense, you obviously want to cooperate. But if you try to force everything through those filters, you will probably get in trouble.''</p>
        <p>The situation, Mr. Pearlstine said, is not unlike that in which Time Inc.  found itself when Time magazine sought a television network as a partner in producing a special based on Time magazine's Person of the Century issue.</p>
        <p>''We went to CNN first and they said, 'We don't have a lot of money to put into this, and we don't have 50 years of archives because we haven't been around that long, and we don't have that many customers for this kind of appointment viewing,' '' he said. ''Meanwhile, CBS was there saying, 'We have fifty years of archives, and lots of eyeballs and money to put into it.' So we wound up doing the deal with CBS.''</p>
        <p>All the instincts within the company, Mr. Pearlstine said, ''will be to -- the old Wall Street cliche -- 'unlock shareholder value' by finding more synergy in the deal.'' But he added that ''Gerry, and certainly Case, at least to date, have been saying that where it makes sense, we will do deals, but where it does not, we will not.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pearlstine insisted there were no substantial problems at Real Simple -- although one senior staff member said the new magazine might better be described as ''real complicated.''</p>
        <p>''It has some work to do, and it is a hard concept to execute,'' he said. He added that because of the swift success of Teen People and In Style, both of which also originated in the People division, the introduction of Real Simple faced higher expectations from the outset than most magazines. The first issue was also released at the same time as the first issue of Hearst Magazine's ''O: The Oprah Magazine,'' which Mr. Pearlstine described as ''first rate.''</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the larger corporate structure has yet to affect Mr. Pearlstine, or his relationship with Mr. Logan. It is known throughout Time Inc. management that Mr. Logan and Mr. Pittman get along well. They share the ideas about using each other's companies to get more subscriptions and about using the two companies together as a formidable advertising platform -- and they share similar Southern backgrounds.</p>
        <p>''I'm from Mississippi, and he's from Alabama,'' Mr. Logan said. ''So we both know the difference between hush puppies and barbecue.''</p>
        <p>As for filling the uber-editor job, candidates mentioned include Mr. Pearlstine, Mr. Isaacson and, to a lesser, degree, Mr. Huey.</p>
        <p>Mr. Logan would not comment on whether the new position will be created. As for any other changes, he said: ''You will see some movement within the management teams. But it too early to say what.''</p>
