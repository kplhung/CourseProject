        <p>Anything for a laugh. So say the real authors of the Jewish jokes that Vice President Al Gore used last week, without attribution.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore got some big laughs during a speech to the Anti-Defamation League in Washington last week by reciting some titles of imaginary Jewish country-and-western tunes. (Example: ''The Second Time She Said 'Shalom,' I Knew She Meant Goodbye.'')</p>
        <p>He never mentioned the source of the jokes, but after Mr. Gore's routine was reprinted and rebroadcast by several news outlets, a wave of voices washed up on the Internet to give credit to the authors, who turned out not to be from Mr. Gore's speech-writing shop, as one might have supposed, but ordinary folk who contributed to an online humor site (www.topfive.com).</p>
        <p>Nobody is terribly angry, just a little confounded about what to do. ''The last thing I want to do is start up trouble, because I'm a Gore supporter,'' Chris White, 42, who is the editor of the Web site and lives in Manhattan, said in an interview.</p>
        <p>''I'm in a quandary, because I honestly believe he's too busy and has more important things to do than to give us credit,'' Mr. White said. ''But at the same time it's annoying because it's copyrighted material, and we work hard to do our stuff.''</p>
        <p>He said he had not called Mr. Gore's staff to complain. ''It would be nice to get some recognition, but I'm not sure how far I want to pursue it,'' Mr. White said. ''If we get to be too much of a pest, he'll stop using the material.''</p>
        <p>The vice president's office more or less shrugged off the fact that Mr. Gore had not attributed the jokes. ''Like all of us, the vice president, when he hears a funny joke, tells it to others and passes it on,'' said Melissa Ratcliff, a spokeswoman for his office.</p>
        <p>''In this case,'' she said, ''the vice president has been repeating these jokes for ages.''</p>
        <p>Mr. White said the Jewish jokes had been culled from his contributors around the country and posted on his Web site on Feb. 24, 1999. Mr. Gore has apparently used them a couple of times since, but they are by no means part of his regular campaign speeches.</p>
        <p>One of the titles mentioned by Mr. Gore was dreamed up by John Treusch, 34, a computer systems administrator in Burlington, N.J. He described himself in an interview as a frustrated English major who was happy to have found an outlet for his verbal skills.</p>
        <p>He said that he had no real complaint about the vice president using his material, but ''I'd rather have Dennis Miller use my stuff than Al Gore.''</p>
