        <p>EVENTS</p>
        <p>Up on the Roof</p>
        <p>When the sun shines, and the temperature begins to climb, it is a grand old New York tradition to head for the roof, even at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. So beginning tomorrow the museum's Iris and B. Gerald Cantor Roof Garden, a 10,000-square-foot terrace  commanding a view of Central Park and the Manhattan skyline, is the place to look for a new installation. ''David Smith on the Roof'' is devoted to the welded and burnished-steel sculptures created at the height of his career by Smith (1906-1965), one of the 20th century's foremost American sculptors. The show, through late fall, weather permitting, is described as the first solo exhibition of Smith's sculpture in the city since a retrospective in 1969 at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum. Information: (212) 535-7710.</p>

        <p>Master's Touch</p>
        <p>The son of the painter Giovanni Santi began his career in his father's studio, and though he lived only to age 37, he ranks with Leonardo and Michelangelo as a pre-eminent painter of the High Renaissance. His name was Raphael, and in an exhibition that opened yesterday at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, more than 60 drawings by him and his circle are on view through July 23. Selected from the British Royal Collection, ''Raphael and His Circle: Drawings From Windsor Castle'' includes 21 works by Raphael (1483-1520). The show travels to the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto from Aug. 6 through Oct. 15 and to the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles from Oct. 31 through Jan. 7, 2001. Information: (202) 737-4215.</p>
        <p>Literary Lights</p>
        <p>Tonight's the night the writers come out, flocking at 6:30 to the Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center for the PEN American Center literary awards. The first PEN/Nabokov Award, with a $20,000 prize for achievement in various genres and for enduring originality and consummate craftsmanship, goes to William H. Gass, the author of ''Reading Rilke.'' The first PEN/Architectural Digest Award, with $10,000 for writing on the visual arts, goes to Anne Hollander, the author of ''Feeding the Eye.'' The first PEN/Amazon.com Short Story Award goes to Meera Nair of Brooklyn, whose story ''Video'' was chosen from more than 12,000 entries. Other winners include  the playwrights Horton Foote and Suzan-Lori Parks. Information: (212) 334-1660, extension 108.</p>
        <p>Salute</p>
        <p>Schuyler G. Chapin, the commissioner of cultural affairs for New York City, will be honored at 7:30 tonight at the New York Pops Gala at Carnegie Hall. Among the scheduled performers at the concert, led by Skitch Henderson, are William Warfield in Aaron Copland's ''Lincoln Portrait''; Kevin Kline as a guest conductor; and Sally Ann Howes, Marin Mazzie and Marni Nixon.
