        <p>The governing Social Democrats won a comfortable victory today in Germany's largest state, North Rhine-Westphalia, confirming both the resurgence of Chancellor Gerhard Schroder and the plight of his opposition foes.</p>
        <p>Projections from German television gave the Social Democrats 43.5 percent of the vote and the opposition Christian Democrats 37 percent. Before a financial scandal engulfed the Christian Democrats six months ago, the party appeared poised to win the state, which has been governed by the Social Democrats for 34 years.</p>
        <p>But the Christian Democratic candidate, Jurgen Ruttgers, was unable to overcome the effects of the scandal, and his decision to try an anti-immigrant message in a pragmatic part of Germany backfired.</p>
        <p>As a result, Wolfgang Clement, 59, the Social Democratic premier of the state, who has been pursuing the economic transformation of areas once dominated by coal and steel, will remain in office -- almost certainly in a coalition with the environmentalist Greens.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clement resembles Mr. Schroder in that he is determined to move the party toward the center. He has called himself the chairman of ''North Rhine-Westphalia Inc.'' -- a remarkable title in a state where Social Democrats' strength long came from labor unions.</p>
        <p>But in a state of 18 million people, a major shift is under way from heavy industry toward media, Internet and telecommunications businesses.</p>
        <p>After an indifferent first year in office for Mr. Schroder, his popularity has risen as his policies became clearer and the Christian Democrats reeled.</p>
        <p>Still, in the projections from exit polls and early returns, the Social Democrats' share of the vote appears to have fallen about 2.5 percent from the last state election in 1995. The Christian Democrats' vote seems to have fallen by about 1 percent.</p>
        <p>According to the projections, the Greens took 7.1 percent of the vote, a sharp decrease from their 10 percent in 1995. They were overtaken as the third party by a resurgent Free Democratic Party, which more than doubled its vote -- to 9.5 percent, from 4 percent five years ago.</p>
        <p>This strong showing by the party that most favors market-oriented and business-friendly reform appeared to result partly from the migration of voters from the Christian Democrats and partly from the successful campaign of its leader, Jurgen Mollemann.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mollemann, who has a reputation as a risk-taker who gets things done, has been challenging Mr. Clement to abandon his coalition with the Greens and to form one with the Free Democrats.</p>
        <p>Today, he branded the Social Democrat-Greens alliance ''a coalition of losers.''</p>
        <p>But it appears unlikely that Mr. Clement will turn toward a coalition that would be unpopular with labor unions, which see the Free Democrats as the party of big business. A coalition with the Free Democrats would also tend to undermine Mr. Schroder's national government of Social Democrats and Greens, although that union -- at both national and state levels -- has suffered tensions, particularly over environmental issues.</p>
        <p>For the Christian Democrats, the vote suggested how much the party still needs to do to recover from the scandal that tarnished the reputation of former Chancellor Helmut Kohl. The new party leader, Angela Merkel, has brought a clear sense of renewal, but the thrust of party policy over such issues as Europe and immigration remains unclear.</p>
