        <p>Letter from Robert F Trager agrees with Thomas L Friedman that in international trade bill, as much should be done for labor as can be done without harming everyone (labor included) (May 9 Op-Ed)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Thomas L. Friedman (column, May 9) reports Robert B. Reich's suggestion of giving labor a ban on the permanent replacement of striking workers and tripling the fines against any company that illegally fires workers for trying to form unions in return for permanent normal trade relations for China. Labor is against globalization because it feels it gives capital an exit option. If capital doesn't like the terms offered by labor here, it can go elsewhere.  So, giving labor the opportunity to set higher terms just speeds capital's flight.</p>

        <p>Many would agree with Mr. Friedman that as much should be done for labor as can be done without shooting everyone (labor included) in the foot.  But despite the sound and fury in Seattle and Washington, Mr. Reich presumes too much in suggesting that labor doesn't understand the terms of its own argument.</p>
