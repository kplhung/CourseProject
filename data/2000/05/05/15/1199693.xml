        <p>ABOUT a year ago, Joel Klein, chief of the Justice Department's antitrust division and perhaps Bill Gates's least favorite lawyer, was moving into his new home in Washington. He called for cable service and was told that the cable guy could come between 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Could they be more specific, Mr. Klein asked.</p>
        <p>No, they couldn't.</p>
        <p>''I thought of saying, 'Do you know who you're talking to?' '' Mr. Klein recalled.</p>
        <p>He told the story during a recent panel discussion about monopolies, a forum whose unstated question for debate seemed to be: If Bill Gates worries the government, then shouldn't the cable guy -- in the form of a merged AOL-Time Warner -- drive the antitrust people absolutely nuts? For Mr. Klein, at least, the two situations are not comparable. (More on him later.)</p>
        <p>The discussion, part of The New Yorker's 75th anniversary celebrations, came a few days after Time Warner blocked signals from Disney's ABC network to millions of cable subscribers, then restored them a day and half later.</p>
        <p>Time Warner executives declined invitations from Ken Auletta, the New Yorker writer who organized the panel, to take part.  So they weren't on hand to defend themselves from the view put forward by some panelists that the planned merger of America Online and Time Warner could turn the Internet from an open prairie into a collection of fenced and gated estates.</p>
        <p>Disney proponents, led by the company's pugnacious Washington lobbyist, Preston Padden, who urged confrontation with Time Warner, have used the ABC blackout as evidence of why the merger would be dangerous. Mr. Padden, a panel member whose  boss, Michael Eisner, sat in approving attendance in the audience, portrayed AOL-Time Warner as ''Microsoft on speed,'' and called the blocking of ABC's signal ''a remarkable display of monopoly power.''</p>
        <p>This proved too much for another panelist, Candace Carpenter, the founder of iVillage, a Web site for women. Having already said that Disney was first among the media giants that had tried to squash her and her Web site -- ''I'm representing the mice'' in the day's discussion, she explained -- she put her head in her hands and said, ''Disney as the underdog is such an amazing concept.''</p>
        <p>Although iVillage shares have fallen from a high of more than $100 after the initial public offering last year to below $8 on Friday, Ms. Carpenter actually remains optimistic that mice like her can survive by  building strong brands and befriending a corporate elephant or two. And she opposes government intervention as a means for  preserving competition. But she said, ''I do think distribution is going to become a narrower funnel.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Padden's strongest support, on legal and technical grounds, came from Lawrence Lessig, a Harvard Law School specialist in technology and antitrust who has managed to vex both Microsoft and Time Warner. Mr. Lessig first drew Microsoft's objections in 1997, when the judge presiding over the antitrust case appointed him to sort out some issues related to the government's 1995 agreement with the company.</p>
        <p>Based on his comments as a panelist, Mr. Lessig is now poised to become AOL's and Time Warner's least favorite lawyer. ''I'm deeply, deeply pessimistic,'' Mr. Lessig said. He explained that as Internet service progressed from narrow to broadband, it would be easier for those providing the service to favor some forms of content -- theirs -- over others. The openness that has made the Web so inviting to new ventures and ideas will suffer, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lessig reminded his audience that AOL formerly wanted the government to guarantee neutrality in high-speed Internet communications via cable TV systems, but changed that position once it agreed to merge with Time Warner. All the more reason for the government to step in, he said, adding, ''You don't want the Internet to turn out like TV.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Eisner, Disney's chief executive, took in these arguments with a benign smile. He declined to comment.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lessig also needled the Disneyites, saying that a proposed law to strengthen and extend copyrights would hinder public discourse and innovation. He said the ''Mickey Mouse Protection Act,'' as he called it, and similar measures seem to come up whenever Mickey risks falling into the public domain.</p>
        <p>Time Warner took the opportunity to respond to the panelists a few days later. Ed Adler, a spokesman from Time Warner, said in an interview that AOL and Time Warner had committed themselves to offering diverse content. And he said that any discrimination in favor of their own products -- on the Web, on cable, or anywhere else -- would scare off their other corporate customers. ''If either company did that, there would not be a business,'' he said.</p>
        <p>With the AOL-Time Warner merger now before the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Communications Commission, Mr. Klein of the Justice Department doesn't have jurisdiction in the matter. But he does have an opinion: that the AOL-Time Warner merger is nothing to fear or prevent.</p>
        <p>''Who would think in a panel of all these people, I'm the optimist?'' he said. ''There is a market mechanism that is going to answer this question. Technology is so powerful that in the next three to five years there are going to be alternative mechanisms into the home.''</p>
        <p>Microsoft had proven a much bigger threat, he said, because the company was able to use its monopoly power to restrict Netscape's access to personal computers. (He said he couldn't recall the cable company that had refused to give him a specific appointment. It wasn't Time Warner.)</p>
        <p>Microsoft had no representative on the Auletta panel. But the company points to the pending AOL-Time Warner merger as evidence that others can indeed thrive as Microsoft's rivals. AOL, in fact, has pounded Microsoft's MSN Web network at every opportunity. ''AOL, before and after its merger with Time Warner, is a serious competitor on a wide range of businesses,'' Jim Cullinan, a Microsoft spokesman, said in an interview.</p>
        <p>If the panelists' debate had no clear winner, at least one thing is now clear: In wanting to fend off government, Microsoft, AOL and Time Warner, Bill Gates and the cable guy are all on the same side.</p>
