        <p>No team in National Basketball Association history has won a playoff series after losing the first three games, so perhaps the Phoenix Suns just delayed the inevitable today. Their decisive 117-98 victory in Game 4 of the Western Conference semifinals, though, again exposed the Los Angeles Lakers as vulnerable favorites to become champions.</p>
        <p>With a chance to sweep the series and earn valuable rest, the Lakers were blown out from the opening tip-off at America West Arena, falling to a hail of Suns 3-pointers and career playoff games from Cliff Robinson and Jason Kidd. Robinson shook off an ankle sprain and scored a career playoff-high 32 points. Kidd notched a triple-double with 22 points, 10 rebounds and a career playoff-best 16 assists. Rodney Rogers had 17 points and Penny Hardaway added 16.</p>

        <p>No team in National Basketball Association history has won a playoff series after losing the first three games, so perhaps the Phoenix Suns just delayed the inevitable today. Their decisive 117-98 victory in Game 4 of the Western Conference semifinals, though, again exposed the Los Angeles Lakers as vulnerable favorites to become champions.</p>
        <p>With a chance to sweep the series and earn valuable rest, the Lakers were blown out from the opening tip-off at America West Arena, falling to a hail of Suns 3-pointers and career playoff games from Cliff Robinson and Jason Kidd. Robinson shook off an ankle sprain and scored a career playoff-high 32 points. Kidd notched a triple-double with 22 points, 10 rebounds and a career playoff-best 16 assists. Rodney Rogers had 17 points and Penny Hardaway added 16.</p>
        <p>Taking a more aggressive approach to their shot selection, the Suns made 47.6 percent of their 3-point attempts, sinking 10 of 21. The Lakers made only 2 of 16 3-point shots.</p>
        <p>The Suns were constantly in the Lakers' faces on defense, too, and were especially effective against Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant. O'Neal, who was whistled for his fifth foul with 4 minutes 41 seconds left in the third quarter, finished with 24 points and 9 rebounds. Bryant scored 23 and Glen Rice had 15. The Lakers, who lost two games at Sacramento in their previous series, again lacked a knockout punch, shooting 44.2 percent and falling well short of the Suns' 52.3 percent.</p>
        <p>The Suns won more than an extended playoff stay in pushing the four-of-seven-game series to 3-1. After losing seven straight games to the Lakers, the Suns believe they have the Lakers backpedaling into Tuesday night's Game 5 in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>''To me, it feels like we're even, because of how well we've played these last three games,'' Hardaway said. ''If Kobe doesn't hit that shot, we might be 2-2 or we might be up, 3-1. If we can do that again in L.A., we're coming all the way back.''</p>
        <p>The Suns shot 58 percent and ripped the Lakers for 71 points in the first half. Robinson fueled the rout with 23 points, hitting 9 of 13 field-goal attempts and 3 of 5 3-pointers. Kidd's energized play boosted the offense and resulted in 16 points and 12 assists.</p>
        <p>''They hit some shots, but we helped them hit even more shots,'' Bryant said. ''We opened the floodgates for them.''</p>
        <p>The Lakers were flat from the start and shot only 41.3 percent in the first half. O'Neal hit his first shot, but then missed his next six field-goal attempts. Bryant was 7 of 12 for 15 points, but he and O'Neal received little help from the other starters or the Lakers' bench, which contributed only 8 points.</p>
        <p>As in Games 2 and 3, the Suns dominated the first quarter, taking a 38-24 lead behind the play of guards Kidd and Hardaway.</p>
        <p>Kidd, playing on a still-sore left ankle that needed two screws after he broke it March 22, awoke from a series slump with 10 points and 8 assists in the quarter.</p>
        <p>He ended the quarter with a running, one-handed 3-point shot from the top of the key that banked in at the buzzer. Hardaway, coming off a 31-point performance in Game 3, had 7 points and 3 assists. Robinson added 9 points before breaking loose in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>''They didn't have anything to lose,'' Kidd said. ''We had everything to lose, so we came out with even more energy than we had in the last two games. We finally got over the hump against these guys.''</p>
        <p>This time, the Suns did not relent after grabbing an early 10-point lead. After a 3-point play by Corie Blount and a 3-point shot by Rogers made the score 27-17, the Suns kicked into a higher gear and finished the first quarter with a 3-pointer by Robinson and Kidd's dramatic shot.</p>
        <p>Still, after losing double-digit leads in Games 2 and 3, the Suns expected the worst. Surprisingly, the Lakers never threatened a rally.</p>
        <p>''We didn't play defense at all,'' Rice said. ''They were kicking the ball around and getting open shots whenever they wanted to. They gave us a good beating today. When you get embarrassed like that, you want to return the favor.''</p>
