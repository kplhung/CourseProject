      <abstract>
        <p>Letter from Jerome I Levinson, prompted by Thomas L Friemdan's May 9 Op-Ed on organized labor's opposition to free trade bill, says corporate property rights are protected on international trade, but no parallel protection is there for core worker rights</p>

        <p>Re ''America's Labor Pains,'' by Thomas L. Friedman (column, May 9): Multinational companies are much more aggressive in opposing unions, but not only because of the deficiencies of United States labor law. They also use the threat of moving manufacturing operations abroad to get their way in collective bargaining negotiations. That is what has occurred after the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''America's Labor Pains,'' by Thomas L. Friedman (column, May 9): Multinational companies are much more aggressive in opposing unions, but not only because of the deficiencies of United States labor law. They also use the threat of moving manufacturing operations abroad to get their way in collective bargaining negotiations. That is what has occurred after the North American Free Trade Agreement.</p>
        <p>The overriding issue is the effort to force a one-size-fits-all, rule-based system for the protection of corporate property rights on the international trade, investment and finance system, when that system includes no parallel protection for core worker rights. Countries like Mexico and China, which use coercive power to deny workers the most basic rights, then gain a competitive advantage.</p>
