        <p>Seven years and 40 pounds ago, Benny Agbayani batted leadoff at Hawaii Pacific University. He looked and played the part: Agbayani was speedy enough to also be a college wide receiver.</p>
        <p>Agbayani, the Mets' 6-foot, 225-pound outfielder, no longer looks lean enough to be a conventional leadoff hitter, but Manager Bobby Valentine has never been interested in convention. Several Mets will be used in the leadoff role after Saturday's release of Rickey Henderson -- Joe McEwing started there for the second straight game yesterday -- and Agbayani will be among them. So will Jon Nunnally.</p>

        <p>Seven years and 40 pounds ago, Benny Agbayani batted leadoff at Hawaii Pacific University. He looked and played the part: Agbayani was speedy enough to also be a college wide receiver.</p>
        <p>Agbayani, the Mets' 6-foot, 225-pound outfielder, no longer looks lean enough to be a conventional leadoff hitter, but Manager Bobby Valentine has never been interested in convention. Several Mets will be used in the leadoff role after Saturday's release of Rickey Henderson -- Joe McEwing started there for the second straight game yesterday -- and Agbayani will be among them. So will Jon Nunnally.</p>
        <p>When Valentine managed the Texas Rangers, he used Brian Downing, a former catcher, as his leadoff hitter, with good results. Downing had little speed, but he could get on base and drive in runs.</p>
        <p>''I remember when he managed Texas, people said, 'This guy isn't a leadoff hitter,' '' Agbayani said, referring to Valentine and Downing. ''People look at me and say, 'He doesn't look like a baseball player.' If I lead off, they're going to say I'm not a leadoff hitter. You've got to prove people wrong.''</p>
        <p>Agbayani has batted leadoff only three times in his major league career, once this season. He has always had Valentine's support, and he will be among those who get a chance for several reasons.</p>
        <p>Henderson had only one extra-base hit and two runs batted in this season; rallies that began at the bottom of the order died once the lineup turned over. More than 40 percent of Agbayani's and Nunnally's career hits have been for extra bases; McEwing's ratio is about 30 percent. Agbayani is hitting .293 this year, Nunnally .200, and McEwing has two hits in eight at-bats in his two games.</p>
        <p>Henderson was batting .219, but with a .387 on-base percentage.</p>
        <p>''People who've been watching our games and see how runs are created will think that the double in the leadoff spot is as important as the walk,'' Valentine said, ''if not more desired.''</p>
        <p>Then there is the matter of speed. Henderson's had not been much of a factor; he stole five bases in seven attempts and made only one or two attempts in non-hit-and-run situations. Agbayani, Nunnally and McEwing are not fast, nor is Darryl Hamilton, who will be another consideration when he returns from toe surgery in several weeks.</p>
        <p>Valentine says he thinks speed does not matter much anyway. He would rather have speed at the bottom of the lineup, which partly explains why he prefers Jay Payton, who is fast but not very selective at the plate, batting lower in the order.</p>
        <p>''Speed at the leadoff spot is the most overrated, talked-about thing in baseball, in my opinion,'' Valentine said. ''The guys who hit the most extra-base hits bat third or fourth. The leadoff hitter's usually on base when they're hitting. Why in God's name do we want the guy who runs the fastest scoring on home runs?</p>
        <p>''Secondly, if a guy's going to steal, unless he has a very, very high stolen-base ratio, why would you ever want to make an out before the best hitters hit?''</p>
        <p>Valentine wants his leadoff hitter to be well-rounded offensively, like the Henderson in his prime who could draw walks and get extra-base hits. Agbayani and Nunnally -- like Melvin Mora, who is on the disabled list with a lacerated finger -- are looking for an everyday chance anywhere in the lineup.</p>
        <p>As for Henderson, he cleaned out his locker at Shea Stadium yesterday morning and said he would spend the afternoon fishing. The Mets worked to unload Henderson on Saturday, offering to pay the remainder of his $2 million salary if some team -- any team -- would trade them something in return. But General Manager Steve Phillips had no takers.</p>
        <p>''He just gave me my freedom,'' Henderson said. ''That's really probably the best thing that can happen.''</p>
        <p>Henderson, 41, wished the Mets well and said his year-plus in Flushing was a ''great experience'' that just did not work out. His Mets teammates will see him somewhere soon, he vowed.</p>
        <p>''They always put me on the highlights,'' Henderson said. ''Maybe that ball that didn't get out of the ballpark will get out of the ballpark.''</p>
        <p>That was a reference to Henderson's last Mets hit, a single off the left-field wall on Friday that would have been a double had Henderson run instead of breaking into a home run trot. Later in that game, he failed to score from first on a double by Derek Bell, further evidence to the Mets that they could not trust him to give full effort at all times.</p>
        <p>That is one thing the Mets know they will get from Henderson's immediate replacement at the leadoff spot, McEwing, a second-year major leaguer. ''I don't think he'll get booed for lack of effort at any point in his career,'' Phillips said.</p>
