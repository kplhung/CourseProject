        <p>Eighteen months into the transition to digital television, sales of the expensive sets remain weak, although the numbers are growing. In March, fewer than 25,000 high-definition televisions were sold.</p>
        <p>Sales are dampened not only by high prices -- $3,000 and up -- but by huge uncertainties.</p>
        <p>There is still no way to connect a digital cable box to a digital TV set, for example, and no knows when that long-dangling problem will be resolved.</p>
        <p>The consumer electronics industry is also trying to move aggressively into the field of home networking, the idea being that soon the television will be able to talk to the home  audio system and eventually to the lighting system, refrigerator and burglar alarm. But the interfaces between all these appliances have not yet been designed.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, there is still a question whether the government may eventually choose to replace the transmission system that is part of the digital-television standard, because the current system has been shown to work poorly in some circumstances.</p>
        <p>With all the imponderables, it is little wonder that many consumers have decided to wait.</p>
        <p>Last week, though, one major manufacturer of digital TV sets, Mitsubishi, announced a new program that could calm the fears of potential early users: buy a high-definition TV now, and in the future the company will come back and install an upgrade module that includes cable connectivity, home networking and whatever additional technology has been accepted at the time.</p>
        <p>''We believe that because the high-definition display is the most expensive part of this it needs to have a future,'' said Robert Perry, director of marketing for Mitsubishi.</p>
        <p>The module, which Mr. Perry said would sell for less than $1,000, would be a small box, an inch or two thick and six or seven inches wide, that would include the new electronic parts and connectors for cable boxes or other devices. It can also include a digital receiver since most digital sets come without the receiver.</p>
        <p>''Most people don't want a receiver yet,'' Mr. Perry said. ''There's not enough high-definition material on the air.''</p>
