        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Judging People by the Pictures They Keep'' (Workplace section, May 10):</p>
        <p>You ask, ''If one picture is worth a thousand words, what is the meaning of the dozens of photos of spouse and children on display in your manager's office?''</p>
        <p>More often than not, it means that the manager has an office advantage -- one of heterosexual privilege.</p>
        <p>While in theory everyone should feel free to bring in photographs of significant others, it is very common for gay men and lesbians to feel reluctant to do so.</p>
        <p>I have the liberty to display a picture of my boyfriend without hesitation; some gay men and lesbians are not as lucky.</p>
        <p>Sadly, many office environments are not yet accepting enough to have a gay man bring his partner to the holiday office party, or even to hang a picture of him in his cubicle.</p>
