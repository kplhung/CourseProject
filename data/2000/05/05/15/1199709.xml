        <p>Bernard Arnault, the chief executive of the luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, wants to get something straight.</p>

      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Bernard Arnault, the chief executive of the luxury goods conglomerate LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, wants to get something straight.</p>
        <p>''I don't see myself at all as a fashion guy,'' he said in fluent, if heavily accented English, in a conference room adjacent to his office at LVMH's headquarters here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arnault, who controls an A-list of luxury goods companies including Louis Vuitton, Christian Dior, Tag Heuer and Dom Perignon, would much prefer to be considered ''a business guy'' -- even if he happens to manage fashionable businesses. And even if he happens to be garbed in Dior from head to toe, as he gives an interview.</p>
        <p>Lately, Mr. Arnault has begun to move beyond tres chic to geek chic, personally investing hundreds of millions of dollars of his own money into Internet ventures here in Europe and across the Atlantic. His American investments have included $115 million in the American online trading firm the Datek Online Holdings Corporation, $90 million in the controversial music site MP3.com and about $10 million in the Web auctioneer eBay.</p>
        <p>But those are mere side bets compared with his ambitious investment vehicle, Europ@Web, which he sees as a European version of CMGI, the U.S.-based Internet incubator and holding company.</p>
        <p>He has invested $500 million in Europ@Web (pronounced Europe-at-Web), which plans to make a public stock offering of its shares in July.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arnault's is a decidedly European approach to Internet business -- a game so far being played by executives older and more established than the young upstarts so common on the American Web scene.</p>
        <p>''There'll be no Jerry Yang of Europe,'' said Olivier Beauvillain, a French Internet analyst with the research firm Jupiter Communications in London. Mr. Yang, of course, is the storied young Silicon Valley billionaire who cofounded Yahoo while still a student at Stanford University. ''The big Internet players here are dominated by traditional businessmen,'' Mr. Beauvillain said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, many of Europe's largest Internet operations are outgrowths of traditional businesses, run by management teams with decades of experience. Take bol.com, the European equivalent of Amazon.com. Owned by the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann A.G., bol.com is managed by Heinz B. Wermelinger, who is 53 years old.</p>
        <p>Certainly, at 51, Mr. Arnault, is not merely an investor in the Web. Beneath his tailored suit, he insists, there beats the heart of cybernaut. ''I've had broadband at home for the past year,'' he said proudly, then added a road warrior's lament. ''Sometimes I'm in hotel room and I use narrow band now and it's so frustrating.''</p>
        <p>So far the more than one dozen hatchlings from Europ@Web's incubator have had mixed results. One success is LibertySurf, a French Internet service provider, that recently went public and made Mr. Arnault's initial $58 million investment worth over $2 billion. But Europ@Web's 8 percent stake in a British clothing retailer, Boo.com, has been a disaster, as the company bleeds losses and the management is fleeing.</p>
        <p>Europ@Web has also invested in a bevy of other Internet sites. Mr. Arnault is excited about the prospects for Flutter.com, a new British betting site, and Ze Project, a European online bank. The group has also invested in MetaMarkets, a discussion site for individual investors, and Aucland, a French online auction house.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arnault still spends most of his working time managing LVMH's pedigreed line of luxury products. But he says he devotes about a quarter of his time to Europ@Web, working with his younger colleagues, of whom he observes: ''They aren't concerned with fashion. They wear the Gap.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Arnault contends that even though he has become a tycoon and a staple of the glossy fashion magazines, his younger colleagues do not treat him like a celebrity. ''People are very relaxed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Not too relaxed, though. Chahram Becharat, the 33-year-old managing director of Europ@Web refers to his boss as Mr. Arnault, not Bernard. And Mr. Arnault maintains the constancy of Internet time, in which any time might be work time. ''He usually calls me every weekend,'' Mr. Becharat said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Arnault, who himself started his career as an engineer at a French construction company before trading in his hardhat for haute couture, became interested in the Internet in 1997, when he invested in Cisco Systems Inc. After further investigation, he put a stake in eBay. When both investments came up winners, ''it became obvious that something was happening in the world with the Internet,'' he said.</p>
        <p>While the revolution was in full swing in the United States when Mr. Arnault jumped in, the Internet was still a novelty in Europe. Still, by the time he began Europ@Web in June 1999, investing in European Web sites and Internet service providers, some analysts say he was already too late.</p>
        <p>''Europ@Web would have been a massive force if it came along three years ago,'' said Mr. Beauvillain, the Jupiter analyst. ''A lot of windows of opportunity have closed,'' he added, explaining that much of the Internet in Europe has already been carved out by American imports like Yahoo and Amazon.com and earlier European start-ups.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Arnault sees a benefit to his timing, even with the so-called dot-com bubble in the air.</p>
        <p>''During the exaggeration of this 'exuberance' as the Fed says, you could find any project funded immediately with crazy amounts of money,'' he said, laughing. ''Today there is more common sense. Now we look carefully at the business model.''</p>
        <p>Of course, some business models stand up to scrutiny better than others. Mr. Arnault's due diligence before paying an undisclosed amount for its stake in Boo.com last April, did not anticipate the losses and management turmoil at the British e-clothier. After spending a fortune on advertising, sales have not gone as expected.</p>
        <p>Europ@Web is now beginning a second round of financing for Boo.com in hopes of keeping it afloat. Mr. Arnault declined to discuss the situation.</p>
        <p>What he did want to talk about was the future of retailing on the Internet. ''It will never replace the showroom,'' he said, noting that with many products customers will continue wanting to actually touch and view the goods. ''But it will change the way we buy everything,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''When you want to buy a gift the Web is very useful,'' he continued. ''I have my assistant telling me next week it's my nephew's birthday. So I have to send something. So what should we do?'' he asked. ''A week before, the site can tell me it's his birthday and tell me what he likes. And it will work for many other occasions, like my assistant's birthday, too.''</p>
        <p>Through his personal investments in the Internet, via Europ@Web, Mr. Arnault is gaining experience that helps him assess the online strategies for LVMH's brands. In a few weeks the company is opening eluxury.com, a mini-mall peddling LVMH's most ''fabulous'' brands, according to Mr. Arnault, and some of its rivals' as well.</p>
        <p>Separately, LVMH has also started individual sites for some of its brands, including Dior.com, moet.com, and Sephora.com among others.</p>
        <p>''I like to test the shops,'' said Mr. Arnault, who often Web surfs to keep tabs on the competition. ''When you go to Amazon it's very well done. But there are other sites that are not as good.'' He demurred at naming the homely.</p>
        <p>But he had no compunction about declaring a winner. ''The best site for a fashion brand is Dior.com,'' he said, as if the matter were beyond debate. ''You should look at it. You compare it to competition. No comparison. It's fantastic. Really.''</p>
        <p>The other Internet project he seems to be most proud of is the Internet service provider LibertySurf, which was one of the first companies created by Europ@Web. According to Jupiter Communications, LibertySurf grew to become one of the top four access providers in France early this year, with 374,000 subscribers.</p>
        <p>Talking like an Internet guru, Mr. Arnault argued the benefits of being local. ''So many U.S. companies have so many problems here,'' he said. ''Take AOL in France for example. It was not very good. It's very strange. LibertySurf did in one year here what AOL couldn't do in three years,'' referring to how LibertySurf outpaced the growth of AOL France.</p>
        <p>LibertySurf is a free Internet access provider, modeled on Freeserve in Britain, which gets its revenue from advertising, e-commerce and a share of the local telephone charges that modem users pay in Europe. But Mr. Beauvillain, the analyst, said LibertySurf would face stiff competition as it tried to enter other European markets, where Internet service providers are already ensconced.</p>
        <p>And not all analysts are keen to jump at shares of Europ@Web when it goes public.</p>
        <p>''I hate Internet investment companies, and Arnault's will be no different,'' said Miles Saltiel, an analyst at the investment bank West LB Panmure Gordon in London. ''They attract ludicrous overvaluations and then collapse. But every stupid French investor will buy it because it is Arnault.''</p>
        <p>That may be the rub: with such a high profile, Mr. Arnault's Internet projects tend to have some of the same cachet associated with the fashionable brands of LVMH -- but without the history and proven market of brands that have been around for decades.</p>
        <p>It is a quandary that Mr. Arnault, smoothing his Dior pleats, readily acknowledges. ''I can guarantee that in one century people will drink Dom Perignon -- I am sure of it,'' he said. ''What type of Internet will they look at in one century? I'm not so sure.''</p>
