        <p>If you tuned in to ''Hardball with Chris Matthews'' on CNBC on Wednesday night, you may have been surprised to see Goldie Hawn, the actress, being interviewed by Mr. Matthews about the China trade bill currently pending in Congress.</p>
        <p>There she was, expounding upon whether grapefruit grown in the United States should be sold in China and about the communist nation's buildup of nuclear arms. Isn't this a subject for gray-haired diplomats and politicians?</p>
        <p>Mr. Matthews and his producer personally begged her to do the show. Their reason? Because this is the stuff for gray-haired diplomats and politicians.</p>
        <p>Phil Griffin, executive producer for ''Hardball,'' said he decided he wanted Ms. Hawn on his program after seeing her at a news conference during which she called on Congress to vote against the bill.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hawn is active with human rights issues and considers passage of the bill -- which would normalize trade relations with China -- the equivalent of turning a blind eye to abuses there.</p>
        <p>''The China trade deal ain't exactly a big winner on these talk shows, or anywhere, for that matter, so I said, 'Let's get her on,' '' Mr. Griffin said.</p>
        <p>On big political issues, news producers have certainly had their pick of celebrities -- from Susan Sarandon, who has protested the shooting of Amadou Diallo by New York City police, to Robert DeNiro, who took a stand against the impeachment of President Clinton.</p>
        <p>To some news producers, the number of celebrities with causes has become dizzying.</p>
        <p>''We probably have three or four celebrities appear on Capitol Hill a week,'' said Kim Hume, Washington bureau chief for the Fox News Channel. ''Granted, I'm sure there are celebrities who have real passion about particular issues and they really do want to make a difference. But most of it is a collusion between the way they wish the public would see them and the way the public relations people use them in order to get attention for their causes.''</p>
