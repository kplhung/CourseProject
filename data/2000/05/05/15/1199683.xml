        <p>When Jerry Nachman was a writer for ''Politically Incorrect With Bill Maher'' two years ago, not a single one of the jokes he wrote for the show was uttered by Mr. Maher.</p>
        <p>It sure does seem odd, then, that Mr. Nachman, a longtime New York newsman, has been named a co-executive producer of the ABC program, which features celebrities who discuss the issues of the day. He is in charge of the team of seven who write jokes for Mr. Maher and help him choose issues for discussion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nachman, who began his new job on May 1, said the job was a good fit for him. During his six months at the show in 1998, he did come up with plenty of discussion ideas and got along well with Mr. Maher, he said.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Nachman has certainly spent plenty of time standing at the intersection of entertainment and news, exactly where ''Politically Incorrect'' is parked. He was the news director at both WNBC-TV and WCBS-TV and was editor in chief of The New York Post -- all outlets that tend, in one way or another, to present the news with a little spice.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nachman admits he has not been so successful in the entertainment world. As a development executive for CBS's syndication arm from 1996 to 1998, not a single thing he dreamed up was turned into a real television show.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nachman was having a bit more success working on ideas for film and television independently -- Jerry Bruckheimer, the producer, recently bought one of his treatments -- when the ''Politically Incorrect'' offer came.</p>
        <p>His main goal, he said, will be to get the show's ratings up, though it is currently doing reasonably well. It is watched, on average, by more than 2.5 million people and sometimes does better than CBS's ''Late Show with David Letterman.'' How does he intend to raise the numbers? ''There are tricks,'' he said cryptically.</p>
        <p>This week's trick is not all that mysterious. Each show will be set at the Playboy Mansion.</p>
