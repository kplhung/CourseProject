        <p>A genuine revival of interest in American song is taking place; that was evident on Wednesday night at the 92nd Street Y.

        <p>The three younger composers, each about 40 give or take a few years, are inheritors of a tradition that Mr. Rorem, 76, has long represented.

        <p>A genuine revival of interest in American song is taking place; that was evident on Wednesday night at the 92nd Street Y. The composer Ned Rorem, perhaps best known for his songs, served as host for a program featuring a song set of his own and the premieres of new cycles by Daron Hagen, Ricky Ian Gordon and John Musto.</p>
        <p>The three younger composers, each about 40 give or take a few years, are inheritors of a tradition that Mr. Rorem, 76, has long represented. Like him each has formed close working relationships with poets and singers. Also like Mr. Rorem, each is a pianist, who accompanied his own work on this occasion.</p>
        <p>That said, the very facility these three composers demonstrate for songwriting may mask a lack of musical depth. Like several other noted song composers today, they are writing within a narrow stylistic range, employing an accessible neo-Romantic harmonic language, essentially rooted in tonality with frequent side trips into shifting chromaticism, spiked with twitches of atonal writing for dramatic effect, and they are quick to borrow from the styles of popular music.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gordon's new work, ''Late Afternoon,'' used texts by two elegant poets he studied with, Marie Howe and Jean Valentine, framed by two powerful poems of Jane Kenyon. The musical-dramatic arc of the work is strong. Mr. Gordon, who writes with a sure sense of what the voice can do, clearly had the mellow mezzo-soprano sound of Margaret Lattimore in mind when he composed this work. Still, the wistful, thickly chromatic harmonic language of the music is somewhat generic; the notes don't leap out at you. And when the music turns opulently melodic, Mr. Gordon's sentimental side takes over.</p>
        <p>There were striking surface similarities between Mr. Gordon's harmonic language and that of Mr. Musto, whose cycle ''Penelope,'' written in collaboration with the poet Denise Lanctot, takes a contemporary look at the domestic woes of the mystical wife of Ulysses. The work was sung vividly by the impressive soprano Amy Burton (the composer's wife). Mr. Musto writes ear-pleasing harmonies, thick with seventh chords and bits of dissonance, and ''Penelope'' makes a vocally grand dramatic effect. But this kind of neo-Romantic writing was fresher when Samuel Barber did it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hagen's new cycle, ''A Woman's World,'' was based on a set of poems by Susan Griffin, suggested to the composer by the performer, the dynamic soprano Ashley Putnam. In the first poem, ''I Wake Thinking of Myself as a Man,'' Mr. Hagen writes ''guy music,'' as he calls it, framing the pugnacious vocal line with chunky parallel chords and volleys of pointillistic figurations in the piano part. But over all the music and the ironic humor were rather obvious.</p>
        <p>In this context Mr. Rorem seemed the living master when, with the fine baritone Kurt Ollmann, he performed his ''War Scenes'' from 1969, based on Walt Whitman's bleak dairy of the Civil War. The songs are rather like monologues, and the lean, harmonically gritty music gave stunning impact to Whitman's words.</p>
        <p>The audience was enthusiastic about all the works presented. Whatever the merits of the music, the fact that new songs are being written for eager audiences is news. It's a good habit for everyone to get into.</p>
