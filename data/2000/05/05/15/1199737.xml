        <p>Judging that rapid advances in technology were making businesses and workers more productive in ways that tempered inflation, the Federal Reserve has given the economy more or less free rein over the last five years to find its own limits.</p>
        <p>It may have finally found them.</p>
        <p>After a long spell in which the Fed's patience was rewarded with an almost perfect combination of strong growth, declining unemployment and stable prices, there are tentative but worrisome signs that inflation is emerging from hibernation.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, when the Fed meets on Tuesday to consider whether to raise interest rates, it may feel compelled to adopt a more aggressive inflation-fighting stance than it has employed in years.</p>
        <p>Although Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has provided no clear signal that he has made up his mind, analysts and investors expect the central bank to raise its benchmark interest rate by a half-percentage point at the meeting, abandoning a steady path of smaller rate increases favored of late by Mr. Greenspan.</p>
        <p>Should the Fed opt to go with a half-point rate increase, it would be the first time the Fed has made such a big tightening move since February 1995. Such a move would bring the federal funds target rate to 6.5 percent, its highest level since January 1991, and would be felt by homebuyers looking for mortgages, by anyone financing a car loan or carrying a credit card balance and by companies deciding whether to build a new factory or invest in new equipment.</p>
        <p>Inflation is still more a threat than a reality, and some economists think the Fed is again proving too willing to sacrifice jobs and prosperity in a fight against a phantom enemy. But there is growing evidence of upward pressure on wages and prices.</p>
        <p>Wage growth seems to be accelerating -- good for workers in the short run but a development that could lead employers to push through price increases to maintain profit margins. The employment cost index, which tracks both wages and benefits, surged in the first quarter.</p>
        <p>Broad price measures like the Consumer Price Index are starting to edge up, even after the jump in oil prices is factored out.</p>
        <p>Other indicators, like the Producer Price Index for April, which was released on Friday, provided no firm evidence that inflation has taken root. And if the economy were slowing or running at a more moderate pace, the Fed might be less concerned.</p>
        <p>But despite a string of five quarter-point rate increases by the Fed in less than a year, the economy continues to barrel along, suggesting that inflationary pressures are more likely to intensify than to abate.</p>
        <p>''The free lunch we enjoyed in terms of inflation,'' said Diane Swonk, chief economist at Bank One and president of the National Association for Business Economics, ''is clearly over.''</p>
        <p>The Fed's experiment with giving the economy more running room dates back to the last prolonged episode of prolonged monetary policy tightening, in 1994. Back then, the conventional wisdom among economists held that inflation was all but inevitable if the pace of growth exceeded 2 percent to 2.5 percent a year or if unemployment fell much below 6 percent.</p>
        <p>But even as he was raising rates aggressively during that period to choke off budding inflation pressures, Mr. Greenspan began to notice two things: that inflation was not as strong as might have been anticipated, and that the growth rate of productivity, or output per hour, seemed to be increasing faster than was being captured in the official statistics.</p>
        <p>In March 1994, according to recently released transcripts of one of the Fed's closed-door policy meetings, Mr. Greenspan asked a provocative question of his colleagues around the 28-foot-long conference table in the central bank's ornate board room.</p>
        <p>''Is it automatically the case,'' Mr. Greenspan asked the members of the Federal Open Market Committee, ''that when the economy is tightening up that inflation takes hold?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenspan did not venture a firm answer. But he cited the possibility that ''we are getting extraordinary productivity increases that are keeping unit labor costs down.'' At that point, almost no one else was detecting any improvements in productivity growth, which appeared to be stuck at a lackluster rate of 1 percent, dooming the economy to a tepid performance.</p>
        <p>Out of such musing on Mr. Greenspan's part grew considerable research by the Fed's staff into productivity -- and a growing conviction on the Fed chairman's part that the economy might be capable of higher rates of noninflationary growth than the traditional models suggested.</p>
        <p>The result has been monetary policy that has helped nurture the longest expansion on record, the lowest unemployment in a generation, a resurgence in real wage growth, a flood of business investment that has allowed the United States to reclaim its position of economic pre-eminence and the rise of a stock market that until the last few months seemed rocket powered.</p>
        <p>To some extent, the economy's performance was helped by factors that clearly were not going to last forever, including several years of extremely low oil prices, the downward pressure on compensation costs from the advent of managed health care and the way in which falling import prices helped drive inflation down after the global financial crisis a few years ago.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Greenspan and the Fed never quite bought the notion of a ''new'' economy that was immune from the forces that ignited inflation in the past. And indeed, should the central bank raise rates by a half-percentage point on Tuesday, it would be making the point that America's vaunted technology-driven, globally oriented economy is still subject to the same forces behind the old, discredited speed limits, even if not to those specific limits themselves.</p>
        <p>''There is a tendency to go too far and talk as if we're in a world where there are no limits and where we don't need to think in terms of the old concepts at all,'' said George L. Perry, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, the research organization. ''We're in a position where there's not much doubt about what we have to do -- we have to tighten monetary policy to slow the economy.''</p>
        <p>It is unclear precisely what the economy's new boundaries are and whether they are any more permanent than the old ones. Economists now talk about sustainable growth rates not of 2 percent to 2.5 percent a year, but of as much as 4.5 percent a year.</p>
        <p>Where economists once pinpointed the ''natural'' rate of unemployment -- the level at which inflation begins to accelerate -- at about 6 percent, they are now debating figures like 4.5 percent and even lower.</p>
        <p>But whatever the new speed limits, it is all but certain that the economy is breaking them today.</p>
        <p>The economy grew at a 7.3 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter of last year and at a 5.4 percent pace in the first quarter of this year. Unemployment in April dropped to 3.9 percent, the lowest rate since January 1970.</p>
        <p>''We don't know exactly what the limits are, but the current rate of growth and the current rate of unemployment go beyond the economy's capacity,'' said Mark Zandi, an economist at RFA Dismal Sciences, a consulting firm. ''What's going on now is just too much.''</p>
        <p>Too much, economists fear, to keep a lid on inflation.</p>
        <p>In March, consumer prices jumped 0.7 percent, pushing the consumer price index 3.7 percent above where it was a year earlier. That compares with an inflation rate of 2.7 percent in December and January. And even excluding volatile food and energy costs, prices rose 0.4 percent in March, pushing the ''core'' inflation rate to 2.4 percent, up from 1.9 percent in January.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, compensation per worker rose at a 4.2 percent annual rate in the first quarter, up from 3.8 percent the previous quarter. Unit labor costs rose by 1.8 percent after falling during the previous six months.</p>
        <p>While not overly alarming yet, such signs suggest that more troubling news on inflation is yet to come unless the overheated economy slows down.</p>
        <p>Still, for the Fed, trying to slow the economy to a more manageable 3 percent or 4 percent annual growth rate gives Mr. Greenspan a lot more room for error than if he had to slow growth to the old speed limit of 2 percent. That is a critical difference given that most expansions turn into recessions only when the Fed tightens the interest rate screw too much or too quickly to squelch inflation.</p>
        <p>The degree to which the Fed becomes more aggressive in attacking inflation this week and for the rest of the year depends on a host of factors. The stock market, which Mr. Greenspan had identified as the source of much of the excess demand in the economy, remains volatile, and a sustained move up or down would no doubt heavily influence Fed policy.</p>
        <p>The degree to which inflation actually materializes will clearly play a role. There could be further clues in the Consumer Price Index for April, which is to be released on Tuesday morning just before the start of the Fed meeting.</p>
        <p>There are other factors that are harder to pin down, including the fact that it is an election year. The Fed has not shied away from raising rates during presidential campaigns -- it did so through much of 1992 -- but it might prefer to get any big rate increases out of the way well before the race heats up in the fall.</p>
        <p>But the central question is whether the imbalances in the economy -- particularly the potential for the economy to run short of workers, setting off a spiral in wages and prices -- are substantial enough to overpower the benefits the economy has derived from the rebound in productivity.</p>
        <p>Since he first started raising the issue in the mid-1990's, Mr. Greenspan has become increasingly convinced that widespread technological advances have ignited a resurgence in productivity growth, allowing employers to pay more to workers without facing a choice between higher prices or diminished profit margins. Last month he told a conference at the White House that productivity growth -- which in the last few years has been running at about 3.5 percent -- may still be accelerating.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Greenspan, ever cautious, also made clear that even the magic elixir of improving productivity has its limits.</p>
        <p>''Should the pool of available workers continue to shrink, there is a point at which this safety valve for excess demand will eventually close,'' Mr. Greenspan said, ''even in the face of accelerating productivity.''</p>
