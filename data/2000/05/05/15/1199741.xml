        <p>The dream persists. The sound and sight it presents of her son are so real, so vital, that Levell Garvin wakes up in the greatest frustration, for she can never recall the content of the conversation they always have.</p>
        <p>They could be talking as usual about his college plans and ''the high hopes he had for himself,'' she says, or perhaps her boy is telling her how he longs to return from the dead.</p>
        <p>''There in my mind, Teddy's just sitting and talking to me like he always did, but I can't remember our talk,'' said Mrs. Garvin, mourning the tantalizing dream as much as her lost son on this Mother's Day.</p>
        <p>Teddy Garvin was 17 years old when he was randomly shot to death on a bus last year as it passed through the night in this gun-ridden city. A teenager with a pistol opened fire from the sidewalk as if Teddy were no more than a moving silhouette in some fantasy target range. He died for no apparent motive, the police detectives told Mrs. Garvin.</p>
        <p>''I don't have no evil in my heart towards the boy with the gun,'' said Mrs. Garvin, whose face seemed sadder than most in the great crowd of mothers converging today on the nation's capital for the Million Mom March.</p>
        <p>Family throngs beamed with life in brilliant sunshine. Mrs. Garvin's gaze seemed laced with what she was forced to see last September: her son dead and gone, cast away.</p>
        <p>The dream talk with Teddy was on her mind, she said, as speaker after speaker talked of the continuing toll of children killed by guns.</p>
        <p>''I always tell my kids, 'Talk to me: that's what I'm here for,' and there comes Teddy at night still talking,'' said Mrs. Garvin, a 71-year-old retired hotel chambermaid whose sense of life's harsh demands was visible on her face.</p>
        <p>''When I was a girl the boys used to fight with fists and rocks,'' Mrs. Garvin said. This memory, scary as it once was, has come to be overwhelmed by decades of easy gun purchases and sidewalk firefights that echo for her as somehow both childish and lethal.</p>
        <p>On the edge of the crowd, a frowning young counterdemonstrator wielded a sign with a message for the marchers: ''Keep track of your kids, not my guns.''</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Garvin, quite proud of her children's behavior, read that as a dangerously false choice.</p>
        <p>''They can control the guns better, they really can,'' said Mrs. Garvin, who decided after the pleasant morning fuss of Mother's Day to come by and join the march.</p>
        <p>''Before, I had no sense that this could happen,'' she said of her son being gunned down. ''But now I understand.''</p>
        <p>With this understanding, she could not mask the sadness of her glance, which contrasted with the enthusiasm all around her.</p>
        <p>''I turn off the news now when I hear all the new shootings come on,'' said Mrs. Garvin, whose mothering days are far from over. She is raising four grandchildren and still has two of her own sons at home who, like Teddy, are adopted and, she says, very grateful for their mother.</p>
        <p>''Oh, the kids come with everything for me,'' she said of this day's gifts. ''I tell them each year: no more clothes. But they give me clothes. I got the dresser drawers filled with them,'' she said, her smile suddenly free with delight.</p>
        <p>''Teddy was on that bus coming home after helping his aunt take the little children home,'' she related of his shooting death, one of about 250 in this city last year. Her sense of security living on a cul-de-sac block in southeast Washington was shattered by the gun troubles that, she had always been convinced, only visited other mothers.</p>
        <p>''The preacher used to preach that before the end comes there will be war,'' she said, her mood darkening. ''The Bible says so. And I can see now we're living in that war. I really believe that.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Garvin's hard-eyed image of war lent a sobering aspect to the festive march.</p>
        <p>''You know what my little Vivian told me?'' she said of her 5-year-old grandchild. ''She said Teddy's going to be all right; he's an angel now,'' Mrs. Garvin said, prizing the tale because her granddaughter offered the very thing her own dream lacked.</p>
        <p>''She said they talked in a dream. And Teddy told Vivian he wouldn't be back, but he would always be with us.''</p>
        <p>That seemed gift enough this Mother's Day, as Mrs. Garvin yearned to fathom her own dream conversations with Teddy.</p>
        <p>''There he'll come,'' she said of her son, ''walking through the door to me and talking like always.''</p>
