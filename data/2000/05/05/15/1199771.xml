        <p>Two months after Al Gore triumphantly claimed enough delegates for the Democratic presidential nomination, his campaign is struggling to reorient itself toward the general election, and many of the vice president's closest advisers concede that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has outmaneuvered them in appealing to moderate voters.</p>
        <p>Several senior Gore advisers interviewed at the campaign headquarters here and elsewhere in the country acknowledged that there was unease on several fronts. They said the campaign had drifted and lost focus since the primaries. They expressed concern that Mr. Bush's move to placate moderates after his sharp turn to the right in the primaries was more swift and successful than they expected.</p>
        <p>Some Gore strategists expressed respect, albeit grudging, for Mr. Bush's stewardship of his organization, one that has been run entirely out of Austin, Tex., by a staff largely untested in national campaigns. And the strategists said they regretted that the Gore campaign for weeks allowed itself to become enveloped in the case of Elian Gonzalez.</p>
        <p>Campaign officials accepted some responsibility for Mr. Gore's troubles, saying that at times they had failed to dispense appropriate advice and did not adequately fine-tune his message.</p>
        <p>But mostly, they said, the vice president is suffering because Mr. Bush has moved more aggressively to lay out his agenda, and the public has not had a chance to compare his positions with Mr. Gore's.</p>
        <p>Tony Coelho, the Gore campaign chairman, said in an interview here that while Mr. Gore had distanced himself months earlier from the Clinton administration on the Gonzalez matter, the campaign should have more effectively conveyed that when Mr. Gore spoke out in March, saying the Cuban boy should be granted permanent residency status.</p>
        <p>''It was probably one of our biggest mistakes,'' Mr. Coelho said. ''When we articulated what we did in March, the media didn't know the evolution of his position through four or five months. So the media took it to be something very dramatic when it wasn't. And that was our mistake, not to have put it in perspective.''</p>
        <p>Still, even the most negative Gore advisers insisted that they were not alarmed, and that with Election Day nearly six months away, there was time for the campaign to right itself. But their biggest fear, they said, was that if Mr. Gore does not move quickly to refine his message, impressions may be locked in place.</p>
        <p>The campaign's difficulties have been magnified by several recent opinion polls that show Mr. Gore trailing Mr. Bush in virtually every demographic category. Many surveys have found that Mr. Bush is leading Mr. Gore among almost every age and income group nationally except for elderly voters; Mr. Bush has had more success drawing independents and, strikingly, he is even outperforming Mr. Gore among married women, traditionally a more Democratic constituency. In several important states that are usually reliably Democratic -- like Iowa, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin -- surveys show that the vice president faces unusually tight competition.</p>
        <p>Privately, some Gore advisers said they worried that Republicans had rallied around Mr. Bush far more eagerly than Democrats around Mr. Gore because they were so determined to retake the White House.</p>
        <p>But publicly, many Gore aides insisted it was too early to fret.</p>
        <p>''You know what I keep telling my friends who are panicking over polls?'' asked Donna Brazile, the Gore campaign manager. ''That it's a summertime passion in Washington, D.C.'' Seeking to reassure Democrats, she added: ''The Republican Party cannot win from the right so they are trying to dance and shuffle to the middle. Well, the middle is ours. It's occupied.''</p>
        <p>Carter Eskew, a top Gore strategist, said of Mr. Bush: ''The race has settled somewhat in his favor, but it is still a very close race. In terms of what Bush is doing, there's some good camouflage going on. It reflects a wearing off of some of the damage done to Bush in the primaries. But eventually voters will see through it.''</p>
        <p>Acknowledging the faltering poll numbers, Mr. Coelho said: ''I am cognizant of the fact that with women we need to be better by the time November comes. The thing is that most of these women don't understand where George Bush is on a lot of these issues. The pollsters say the public is a lot more interested in vacations right now.'' But, he added, ''We have a challenge between here and November.''</p>
        <p>One top Gore aide was not as upbeat. ''We went into a lull after the primaries and the Bush campaign went right on script,'' the aide said. ''Gore obviously has to step up his game and differentiate himself. We have to sharpen our focus. We have not focused on the winning formula.''</p>
        <p>Another senior campaign official put it this way: ''The big concern is if the impression in the media becomes that the campaign is adrift -- and that it gets to voters eventually.''</p>
        <p>The belief that Mr. Gore needs to jump-start his operation has sparked internal debate over whether his strategy of ridiculing Mr. Bush's proposals, while successful in the primaries against former Senator Bill Bradley, threaten to make the vice president appear too harsh. Mr. Coelho, for his part, insisted that Mr. Gore would not shrink from his aggressive tone. ''The public wants somebody who will fight,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As part of the drive to sharpen Mr. Gore's presentation and to consolidate a campaign with separate (and at times overlapping) orbits here, at the White House and on the plane with Mr. Gore, the campaign's top advisers and consultants met here Friday for the first of what will be a series of weekly meetings. Participants said they hashed over approaches to refine Mr. Gore's message, as well as tactical considerations, like which states to compete in most heavily.</p>
        <p>Now that the campaign is not strapped for money, as it was in the primaries, Mr. Coelho said he was retooling the organization for such a major infusion of aides that it will soon move to larger headquarters in Nashville. Among the new hires is Mark D. Fabiani, who, as a deputy campaign manager for communications, has been dispatched to help improve sometimes strained relations between the campaign and the press. Mr. Fabiani is a former White House special counsel who helped contain the damage from the Whitewater inquiry.</p>
        <p>''The candidate has done a tremendous job,'' Mr. Coelho said. ''The campaign still struggles to get up to the candidate. I think the execution at times could be better on our part. And we've made some mistakes. But I feel very good about where we are compared to six months ago.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Coelho said, repeatedly, that the press should not dwell on the vice president's recent dips in the polls, but on how he is still in far better shape than six months ago, when Mr. Bush was clobbering him by wide margins. Arguing that Mr. Gore was suffering in part because of expectations, he said: ''We came out of our primary higher than we should have. He came out of his primary lower than he should have.''</p>
        <p>Members of the Gore high command were quick to note that Bill Clinton was way down in the polls at this point in 1992 -- and won the election. And at this point in 1988, Michael S. Dukakis basked in a comfortable lead, only to lose.</p>
        <p>''We've seen this movie before,'' Mr. Eskew said, ''and it has a happy ending.''</p>
        <p>Already, the 2000 campaign has been remarkable for the many reversals of fortune. A year ago, Mr. Gore did not even view Mr. Bradley as a threat. By the fall, Mr. Bradley's success forced Mr. Gore to retool his campaign. And by the end of the primaries, Mr. Gore appeared to be more potent than Mr. Bush, who was severely wounded after a contentious scrimmage with Senator John McCain in which he made stark appeals to the right that many Democrats said would haunt him.</p>
        <p>Karl Rove, Mr. Bush's chief strategist, said his campaign was moving forward with a general election strategy that had long been in place but was interrupted by the primaries. He said the Gore campaign's drive to undermine Mr. Bush's experience would fail because voters ''recognize that Bush has crossed the threshold of experience.''</p>
        <p>''We've had seven good weeks,'' Mr. Rove said. ''With the lights turned back on and the arena flooded with sunlight, Bush has essentially returned to where he was in December and Gore has returned to where he was.''</p>
        <p>Offering a counteranalogy, Ms. Brazile said: ''We're in a big theater and there's no audience. There's not enough people paying attention.''</p>
        <p>Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, said: ''Bush's charm offensive has been quite effective and the challenge for Gore is to get the race re-engaged as quickly as he can. We're in the best period for Bush. He's not forced to operate under pressure or in the heat of the battle. In those circumstances he delivers a plausible and often appealing performance. Gore is at his best in the heat of battle.''</p>
        <p>Another Democratic pollster, Mark Mellman, said: ''There is angst and anguish because you never like to be in a position where you slip. But there's a lot of historic evidence that suggests that what's happening right now doesn't matter very much.''</p>
        <p>Compounding the unease here are complaints by some in the campaign that Mr. Coelho has had a turbulent relationship with Ms. Brazile over disagreement about her taking a top post at the Democratic National Committee. Scoffing at such suggestions, Mr. Coelho said: ''She's strong willed and that's what you need in a manager. Donna's going to be a very valuable star when this is over with.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Coelho also cited -- and immediately discounted -- concerns among some Democrats that he and Ed Rendell, the general chairman of the Democratic National Committee, had been feuding over spending priorities. ''If it wasn't for us, Rendell wouldn't be there,'' Mr. Coelho said. ''Rendell was our creature.''</p>
        <p>The naysayers, Mr. Coelho said, are ignorant of how the campaign is repositioning itself. ''When people say, 'Maybe you've lost some traction,' they have no idea what we're doing,'' he said. ''We're doing what we're supposed to be doing. Just watch us. Watch us as we go forward.''</p>
