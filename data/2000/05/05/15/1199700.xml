        <p>The Intel Corporation plans to announce today that it will spin off a tiny Internet company it hopes will help consumers and business custom-order technology products.</p>
        <p>The spinoff, Developonline.com, is creating a Web site that any individual or business can use to specify the features and options they want in an array of Web appliances, Internet networking equipment and cellular telephones, giving them the ability to choose the color or style of a product, for example, or to add features or fine tune technical capabilities. The Web site will go online some time in the third quarter.</p>

        <p>The Intel Corporation plans to announce today that it will spin off a tiny Internet company it hopes will help consumers and business custom-order technology products.</p>
        <p>The spinoff, Developonline.com, is creating a Web site that any individual or business can use to specify the features and options they want in an array of Web appliances, Internet networking equipment and cellular telephones, giving them the ability to choose the color or style of a product, for example, or to add features or fine tune technical capabilities. The Web site will go online some time in the third quarter.</p>
        <p>Executives of the new company, which will be based in Tempe, Ariz., say they are entering an explosive new arena that will get new technology devices to market faster and enable consumers to take part in shaping them.</p>
        <p>''This changes the rules for mass customization,'' said Alan Steinberg, a 20-year Intel executive who helped conceive the project and is now chief executive of Developonline.com. ''We think this will be a tremendous shift in the development of products; this will create a new category.''</p>
        <p>The company expects to capitalize on a new trend that allows people to use the Internet to customize everything from clothing to Internet-access gadgets. Developonline.com, like others, says that a model for this new-economy development model is Linux -- the popular variant of the Unix operating system that various programmers around the world have been improving and refining because it is freely available on the Internet. Besides being able to customize features, users can also tinker with the technology behind it.</p>
        <p>Company officials declined to provide many specifics ahead of the announcement. But the plan apparently calls for Developonline.com to act primarily as a custom sales agent on behalf of other manufacturers. Executives would not discuss how the Web site would make money or deal with intellectual property issues, but the company said it had already signed agreements that would allow it to offer various technology products for sale on the site.</p>
        <p>Developonline.com has already received $15 million in funding from two venture capital firms, the Carlyle Group and 3i Technology. After the spinoff, Intel will have a 25 percent stake in Developonline.com.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steinberg said Intel helped ''incubate'' the company, which has about 30 employees, with the help of the University of California at Berkeley and Harvard University.</p>
