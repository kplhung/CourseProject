        <p>Avalon String Quartet</p>
        <p>Merkin Concert Hall</p>
        <p>The Avalon String Quartet, which played on Wednesday, is a group of coltish young musicians: eager, full of vim, full of ideas, following one another with enthusiasm. The sound they make is big, strongly projected, with inner parts that speak, or rather sing. Four different personalities are at work, and they are all so engrossed, impassioned and imaginative that they cannot help pulling the music their way at times. They will surely mature, and that in some ways will be a pity, because their youthfulness is so musically fruitful. One problem, though, that needs to be tidied up right away is that of occasional intonation slips.</p>
        <p>Wolf's ''Italian Serenade'' opened the program here, and was a good introduction to the group's style: the performance was full and vigorous. The piece was also, as a love scene, a good introduction to Berg's ''Lyric Suite,'' which the Avalon made as graphic and fast-paced as a movie while also registering its ardent sweep.</p>

        <p>The Avalon String Quartet, which played on Wednesday, is a group of coltish young musicians: eager, full of vim, full of ideas, following one another with enthusiasm. The sound they make is big, strongly projected, with inner parts that speak, or rather sing. Four different personalities are at work, and they are all so engrossed, impassioned and imaginative that they cannot help pulling the music their way at times. They will surely mature, and that in some ways will be a pity, because their youthfulness is so musically fruitful. One problem, though, that needs to be tidied up right away is that of occasional intonation slips.</p>
        <p>Wolf's ''Italian Serenade'' opened the program here, and was a good introduction to the group's style: the performance was full and vigorous. The piece was also, as a love scene, a good introduction to Berg's ''Lyric Suite,'' which the Avalon made as graphic and fast-paced as a movie while also registering its ardent sweep.</p>
        <p>Argument continues about whether the vocal line of the finale -- woven through the instruments in Berg's published score -- should be sung to the Baudelaire sonnet that was revealed as the movement's secret message long after the composer's death. If it is to be sung, though, let it be sung by Lucy Shelton. Her performance here was warm and engaging, with a nice sense of drama and in fine balance with the strings.</p>
        <p>In the second half, the Avalon also had a guest who clearly loved playing with them: Gilbert Kalish. The work was Brahms's Piano Quintet, and its grand spans were fervently sustained, as if consistent force and feeling were what they were made of.</p>
        <p>The scherzo, with Mr. Kalish fierce in attack and rhythm, and the Avalon responding in kind, brought out the subdued violence to a frightening degree.</p>
