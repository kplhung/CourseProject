        <p>Absolute Ensemble</p>
        <p>Miller Theater</p>
        <p>Erkki-Sven Tuur's record ''Crystallisatio,'' released four years ago, suggested that here was another Arvo Part: gentle, slow-moving, waving phrases from Baroque music at his hearers, flat and remote as his native Estonia. Friday night's concert, with fellow Estonian Kristjan Jarvi directing his Absolute Ensemble, showed that this is by no means all there is to Mr. Tuur.</p>
        <p>The effect was disappointing. After all, to do one thing for a long time is a kind of virtue, a proof of discipline and concentration. To do two or three things for a long time gets boring.</p>
        <p>While most of the pieces on the Absolute's program lasted only around 10 minutes, that seemed a long time, and the cumulative effect of 12 compositions, playing for two and a half hours with intermission, was not to the advantage of the composer.</p>
        <p>One piece involving discords crashing into a calm modal context might have been exciting, but not seven or eight. The first injection of the raw sound of an electric violin was a shock. The second, well, was not. And the work including this second dose, ''Architectonics IV: Per Cadenza Ad Metasimplicity,'' gave the evening an odd ending, somewhere between a jam session (with growling amplified baritone sax and bassoon, and synthesizer accompaniment) and a joke.</p>
        <p>There were six other pieces from this ''Architectonics'' cycle, the title suggesting the structural concern that Mr. Tuur makes rather obvious with his jump cuts from one kind of music to another and back again. Equally obvious is his failure, in most cases, to make this kind of form work.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem is that his ideas are so uninteresting; and again, where one uninteresting idea can induce a kind of benign lethargy (alternatively, meditative experience), two or three in alternation soon become irritating. This Absolute evening was remarkable, too, for the composer's lack of flair for instrumental combinations. Much the best pieces were those that were, in instrumentation and material, most minimal: ''Conversio'' for violin and piano, ''Symbiosis'' for violin and bass, and even what sounded like a juvenile Sonatina for two pianos.</p>
        <p>Nor did the concert show the musicians at their best. Some performances had dash (Leila Josefowicz and Mr. Jarvi in ''Conversio,'' for instance). Others were slack.</p>
