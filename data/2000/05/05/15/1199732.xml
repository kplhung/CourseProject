        <p>Like an explorer who has conquered every continent and then strains his weary neck to look on the horizon for new challenges, the light-heavyweight champion, Roy Jones Jr., has reached a point where few boxers have been. There is no legitimate challenger left in his weight class to fight.</p>
        <p>He is a boxer with three titles.</p>
        <p>He is a boxer with a great reputation: pound for pound the best.</p>
        <p>He is also a boxer who looks at fighters around him and yawns. Most of them he has knocked out, beaten up or outlasted.</p>
        <p>Jones is so bored that he now daydreams about fighting heavyweights, even fighting himself. This is how desperate he has become. ''I love to fight,'' he said late Saturday night after he won an 11th-round technical knockout against Richard Hall to successfully defend his International Boxing Federation, World Boxing Council and World Boxing Association belts. ''Sometimes I fight myself I love to fight so much.</p>
        <p>''I fight myself in my sleep. I got a problem. I have daydreams about fighting. Two or three people sometimes.''</p>
        <p>That is what it has come to for Jones -- his best fights occur in his sleep. Or in his daydreams. Or in the mirror.</p>
        <p>But do not feel too sorry for Jones. He has a 42-1 record. He is a millionaire many times over. He is the Michael Jordan of his sport, but even Jordan could find legitimate challengers. Jones cannot.</p>
        <p>There is no better example of this than what happened at Conseco Field House. Hall was supposed to be a fierce challenger. At 6 feet 3 1/2 inches, he stood almost four inches taller than Jones, and there was speculation in the Hall camp that such a height advantage would hurt Jones. There was also talk that Hall's left-handed punching style might confuse Jones.</p>
        <p>Well, Jones chopped Hall down like an oak tree. And left-handed, right-handed or three hands, Hall was no match for Jones.</p>
        <p>''I've seen every style, everything you can throw at me,'' Jones said. ''There is nothing I have not seen.''</p>
        <p>Jones stunned Hall twice in the first round with right-hand punches, knocking Hall down each time. Jones blistered him again in the second round. Then came several rounds in which Jones cruised, failing to attack Hall the way he did early in the fight. Clearly, Jones, as much an entertainer as he is a skilled fighter, wanted the fans to get a good show before he retired Hall for the night.</p>
        <p>''I probably could have pushed the issue in the first round,'' Jones said, ''but what would that have done for me?''</p>
        <p>When asked whether he could have taken out Hall at any point, Jones replied: ''Yeah, but I let time do its own work. I take it as it comes. I don't rush anything.</p>
        <p>''I love to win, but I love to perform, too.''</p>
        <p>The question is, whom will Jones perform against next? Speculation continues that he will move up in weight class to fight the heavyweight champion, Lennox Lewis. ''Do I have a plan as far as Lennox Lewis is concerned?'' Jones said. ''Yeah, I have a plan.'' That's about all he would say.</p>
        <p>The one thing that seems fairly certain is that Jones will not move down in weight.</p>
        <p>What Jones may be looking for is a high-profile, big-payday match against Lewis that would draw attention and excitement to himself and the sport. Such a match would be fascinating and allow Jones, if he should beat Lewis, to retire as a legend. It would also be something Jones seriously needs -- a challenge.</p>
