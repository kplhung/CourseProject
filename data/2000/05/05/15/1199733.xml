        <p>Last Tuesday night in Pittsburgh, the Flyers' Keith Primeau was carried off the ice on a stretcher after being knocked cold by the Penguins' Bob Boughner.</p>
        <p>Few figured that Primeau, Philadelphia's 6-foot-5-inch, 220-pound center, would be back in the lineup anytime soon after absorbing the frightening open-ice hit. Many felt that Primeau, who had sustained a concussion, would miss the entire Eastern Conference finals against the Devils.</p>
        <p>Primeau was not one of those people, although it sounded as if his wife, Lisa, was.</p>
        <p>''While talking with my wife this last week, we both agreed that sometimes you become so focused on a goal, it clouds the rest of the picture,'' Primeau said today after he had surprisingly come back from his injury to skate 21 shifts in the Flyers' 4-1 Game 1 loss to the Devils. ''That may be the case here. Yes, I'm a father and a husband. But I'm also a hockey player. And I wanted to play.''</p>
        <p>Primeau did not deny that he would have lied to team doctors about how he was feeling if he thought it could sway their decision.</p>
        <p>That was something that Primeau, who was cleared to play just before game time, apparently did not have to do. But it was also apparent that Lisa Primeau would have rather seen her husband and the father of their four children take a little more time before lacing up his skates again.</p>
        <p>''But she knows better than to give her 2 cents,'' Primeau said. ''She knows I'll just probably ignore her advice.''</p>
        <p>If Primeau's presence gave the Flyers any sort of emotional lift, however, it was extremely short-lived. The Devils scored just 55 seconds into the game, on Primeau's first shift. He was also on the ice for Bobby Holik's first postseason goal since 1997, at 18 minutes 4 seconds of the first period, which gave the Devils a 3-1 lead.</p>
        <p>Still, Primeau, who scored the game-winner in Philadelphia's five-overtime 2-1 victory over the Penguins in the pivotal Game 4 of the conference semifinal, seemed to play better as the game wore on. Although he finished with a plus-minus rating of minus-2, Primeau was credited with four hits, one of which leveled Claude Lemieux in the third period. Primeau also won 15 of the 20 face-offs he took.</p>
        <p>''As the game went on, I felt more comfortable,'' Primeau said.</p>
        <p>The Flyers are probably going to need a healthy Primeau if they are going to rebound from today's loss to take the four-of-seven-game series.</p>
        <p>''It's tough coming back off that hit,'' said Rick Tocchet, Primeau's linemate. ''You're tired. You're sleepy. But he had three or four big hits today and he was great on draws. He was definitely trying hard out there. And on Tuesday, he'll have even better legs.''</p>
        <p>''I remember looking up at Johnny,'' Primeau said, referring to being on the stretcher in Pittsburgh and looking up at his teammate John LeClair. ''I was telling him I'd be back in that game.''</p>
        <p>Instead, Primeau spent the night in a Pittsburgh hospital.</p>
        <p>''The first day, I had some headaches, but I wasn't sure if that was from a lack of sleep,'' Primeau said. ''Day 2, I had a little bit of pain. Yesterday, I woke up more tired than usual. My biggest concern was how I would feel this morning after a good workout yesterday.''</p>
        <p>Primeau went through the Flyers' warm-up with his teammates, then met with Gary Dorshimer, a team physicians.</p>
        <p>''He was confident I'd be O.K.,'' Primeau said. ''The few symptoms I was having weren't enough to set off any alarm bells for him or me.''</p>
        <p>And so Primeau played. Afterward, he was asked if he had come back so quickly to make a statement, in light of the controversy surrounding the Flyers' treatment of Eric Lindros, who has not played since March 13, nine days after Lindros sustained the fourth of his five concussions over the last two years. Eric Desjardins replaced Lindros as the team captain on March 27.</p>
        <p>''I didn't look at it as I had to play because of everything else going on,'' Primeau said. ''My situation is different than Eric's. It was my decision to play, along with the doctors'. It's a completely different situation.''</p>
