        <p>They are baby boomers of concrete and steel and glass: buildings that muscled into the New York landscape during a gush of expansion after World War II.</p>
        <p>Many New Yorkers walk right by them, oblivious of their architectural pedigree or scorning them as downright ugly.</p>
        <p>Like flesh-and-blood baby boomers, these buildings have reached middle age. With their boxy shapes and clean Modernist lines, once seen as rebellious in a city that cherished Beaux-Arts charm and Art Deco sweep, they have become the latest generation of structures to be embraced by preservationists.</p>
        <p>Among the dozens of sites often mentioned for preservation are Lincoln Center, the George Washington Bridge Bus Station, the New York State Pavilion for the 1964 World's Fair and the former Huntington Hartford Gallery of Modern Art at 2 Columbus Circle. Others are the United Nations, Stuyvesant Town and the Time &amp; Life Building.</p>
        <p>''A lot of very significant architecture may disappear because nobody's paying attention to it,'' said Theodore H. M. Prudon, an architect who is president of the United States chapter of Documentation and Conservation of the Modern Movement, which is compiling a registry of important sites in New York City.</p>
        <p>The Municipal Art Society has a group of architects dedicated to preserving postwar buildings. Landmark proponents are stepping up letter-writing campaigns. And the architect Robert A. M. Stern was manning the ramparts, extolling the virtues of 2 Columbus Circle at a rally last month.</p>
        <p>It is not an easy sell.</p>
        <p>''We're having to do the most difficult of things, to look at the past that many of us grew up in and take a measured historical judgment about it,'' said Roger Lang, an architect and member of the New York Landmarks Conservancy.</p>
        <p>Ned Kaufman, associate director of the Municipal Art Society, described the task: ''It's pushing people's taste and sensibility and their sense of what's in the public good. It's opening people's eyes to new aspects of art in the city we all live in.''</p>
        <p>Under New York's landmarks law, sites become eligible for protection after 30 years. That makes buildings from the 1960's the latest crop.</p>
        <p>Characterized by expanses of glass and airy spaces, these buildings reflect a postwar optimism and the favoring of a rational conception of building instead of emphasis on what Modernists saw as meaningless ornamentation. The buildings' very simplicity, supporters say, makes even minor changes potentially damaging to the designs.</p>
        <p>Although most of these buildings are not yet threatened, some, like the Loeb Student Center at New York University, built in 1959, have recently been torn down. So preservationists assert that the masterpieces of the era should be protected before it is too late.</p>
        <p>But the discussions over the fate of these landmark candidates repeat longstanding debates over New York's concrete fabric: What is worth preserving? What are the criteria? Is it a matter of taste, nostalgia or historical importance?</p>
        <p>Hovering over these questions is the irony that many of these buildings are the products of a Modernist movement that spurned the past and was often blamed for ruining neighborhoods and blighting cities. Modernism back then galvanized the preservationists, who are now struggling to save their old enemy.</p>
        <p>''Two wrongs don't make a right, and tearing down these buildings isn't going to bring those others back,'' said Mr. Stern, a leading champion of Modernist buildings. He said they ''represent a very important period in our culture.''</p>
        <p>Take Park Avenue from Grand Central Terminal to 59th Street. Fifty years ago, it was a stately parade of Beaux-Arts hotels and apartment houses that would very likely be preciously conserved today. Now it is a canyon of corporate boxes, with their own charms for the Modernists.</p>
        <p>''Part of the bad name that Modernism earned is deserved,'' Mr. Kaufman said. ''Some ideas were really hostile to modern life. We've had 30 or 40 years of righteous indignation and even virtuous rage. Now we can begin to take a little bit of a calmer view of what Modernism has left us and recognize that it is not all bad. Tastes change, and they always have.''</p>
        <p>A parallel change in taste is already evident regarding furniture and decor. Midcentury design has become popular, and stores have sprung up around New York specializing in pieces from the 1950's.</p>
        <p>''It is rather ironic that at the same time all this stuff is so hot on the antiques market, the actual buildings are being threatened and lost,'' said Michael Gotkin, a landscape architect in the Municipal Art Society's Modernist group.</p>
        <p>Two Columbus Circle has become a touchstone of the new movement.</p>
        <p>A white, almost windowless monolith with tennis-racket-shaped columns that was built on the southern side of the plaza in 1964, it was designed by Edward Durell Stone to hold the art collection of Huntington Hartford, inheritor of the A.&amp; P. fortune. The city solicited bids for the building, with a May 2 deadline, as part of the redevelopment of Columbus Circle, but has not said when it will announce a decision.</p>
        <p>At least one nonprofit institution, the small Dahesh Museum, says it has come forward with a bid. Museum administrators said they would maintain the building's exterior as is and renovate the interior for the Dahesh collection.</p>
        <p>But preservationists fear that the property is a prime target for a developer who would tear down 2 Columbus Circle for an apartment building or a hotel, destroying a major work by an eminent architect.</p>
        <p>Besides Mr. Stern, the building has attracted champions like Tom Wolfe and local politicians like Assemblyman Richard N. Gottfried, State Senator Eric T. Schneiderman and City Councilwoman Ronnie M. Eldridge. Despite a campaign of letters and protests, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission has declined to hold hearings on possible landmark status for 2 Columbus Circle.</p>
        <p>Others scoff at the idea. They include Schuyler G. Chapin, the city's cultural affairs commissioner, whose office occupied the building until two years ago. ''I've always thought -- personally, and this has nothing to do with my city position -- that the building was a joke,'' Mr. Chapin said.</p>
        <p>Andrew Alpern, a lawyer and architectural historian, questions the new crop of possible landmarks ''The 60's produced an awful lot of just plain boring architecture, and a lot of it not very well done,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Alpern acknowledged that there are some 1950's and 1960's buildings worth keeping, he said overzealous preservationists ''would like to save things that really were not the high points of the Modernist period.''</p>
        <p>Another 1960's building that has been embraced by preservationists is the George Washington Bridge Bus Station in upper Manhattan, noteworthy for its butterfly-shaped roof. Built in 1963, this Port Authority station is the only major work in New York by Pier Luigi Nervi.</p>
        <p>''It's a totally unsung building of great importance,'' said Mr. Prudon, of Documentation and Conservation of the Modern Movement. ''It's like owning a Monet. You should have one in the collection.''</p>
        <p>The Port Authority has negotiated with a developer, McCann Real Equities, to build a movie multiplex on the roof of a connected building across Broadway. Martin Berger, McCann's managing partner, said the project would not touch the Nervi building.</p>
        <p>A dozen modern buildings have been added recently by the landmarks commission out of about 20,000 in the city already protected. They include the CBS ''Black Rock'' building, the Manufacturers Hanover building at 510 Fifth Avenue and 43rd Street, Lever House, the Seagram Building, the Four Seasons restaurant interior, the old T.W.A. terminal at Kennedy Airport and the Whitney and Guggenheim museums.</p>
        <p>Other buildings sit in limbo, like the World's Fair pavilion in Queens, Mr. Gotkin said.</p>
        <p>Then there is Lincoln Center.</p>
        <p>After the arts center was built in the 1960's, the architecture critic of The New York Times, Ada Louise Huxtable, wrote that the public was happy but that ''most professionals'' considered the complex ''a failure of nerve, imagination and talent.'' It was, however, the first major arts complex in the country, architectural historians say, and a new expression of the modern glass-and-concrete style, and it brought together some of the country's most important architects.</p>
        <p>''If you are talking about a Modernist building in New York, that's a premier example,'' said Mr. Prudon, referring to the whole complex.</p>
        <p>The center's management last year commissioned a sweeping report on renovation proposals. The survey suggested possibilities like new buildings, rooftop extensions, an enlarged lobby for the Metropolitan Opera House and a visitors center.</p>
        <p>Preservationists are stirring. An Upper West Side group called Landmark West is supporting Lincoln Center's listing on the State and National Registers of Historic Places. The State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation declared the center eligible on May 1.</p>
        <p>It is too early to say what work will take place, said Beverly Sills, chairwoman of Lincoln Center. A committee from the board of directors has begun developing a master plan, which is expected to be ready by the end of the year, she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sills said that although she did not think landmark status was necessary, ''there is no question we are all aware that we've got to respect the basic architectural integrity of the place. This is an icon in the world.''</p>
        <p>It is not the world that Kathleen Randall worries about. An architectural historian who wrote her thesis on Lincoln Center for Columbia University's architecture school, Ms. Randall sighs over the task of educating New Yorkers about her beloved ''Athens on the subway'' and other buildings of its generation.</p>
        <p>''People will still pick Grand Central over a modern building any day,'' she said.</p>
