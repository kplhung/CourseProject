        <p>THERE being nothing more profound or creative to say about Rudolph W. Giuliani's relationship with Judith Nathan, let us now turn to the lingering question of how -- and why -- the romance became public knowledge.</p>
        <p>If you need a definitive answer, stop reading. If you enjoy mystery with your romance, keep going, because this tale has everything from conspiracy theories to an uninvolved co-conspirator who served as the unintentional catalyst.</p>
        <p>First, the most cockeyed theory, favored by a top Giuliani man: Hillary Rodham Clinton's team planted the story. Sure. As if Mrs. Clinton would want to turn her Senate race upside down and risk having to face a new opponent just as the mayor was losing ground.</p>
        <p>The fact is, New York reporters didn't need such help to ferret out the story. Rumors of mayoral indiscretions have been persistent for years and were recently growing stronger. So were signs of an intensifying rift between Mr. Giuliani and his wife, Donna Hanover. Whispers that the mayor had found a new female friend began floating nearly a year ago, and many reporters say they heard bits and pieces of the story: a first name, gossip about weekends in the Hamptons, that sort of thing.</p>
        <p>But not much aggressive investigation of the matter occurred until recently, maybe because the mayor and his wife made no hypocritical pretense about their marriage and journalists granted them a modicum of privacy. Perhaps reporters didn't want to incur the wrath of the mayor, who can be vindictive even about routine stories.</p>
        <p>Imagine asking mayoral friends sensitive questions. Or conducting a stakeout.</p>
        <p>''What do you do, hide out in the trees outside Gracie Mansion with a long lens?'' asked David Seifman, City Hall bureau chief for The New York Post. ''It's a very murky area of journalism. Reporters can't win. Either we are salacious or we are covering up.''</p>
        <p>Early last month, I'm told, a tipster (identity not revealed) informed someone at The Post that the mayor and a woman not his wife were going to Hanratty's on the Upper East Side for brunch. A Post photographer got a shot of the couple leaving the restaurant a week later.</p>
        <p>But huge stories were breaking, including the government's seizure of Elian Gonzalez in Miami and the mayor's announcement of his prostate cancer, so The Post held back. Then, on May 2, Mitchell Fink of The Daily News included a modest item in his gossip column about the mayor's dining in an East Side restaurant with an unnamed woman. The next day, The Post ran its photo, with Ms. Nathan's name. Mr. Giuliani said at a news conference that she was his ''very good friend,'' and so the story was airborne.</p>
        <p>Hence conspiracy theory No. 2: did the mayor provoke the leak himself -- either because he was trying to push Ms. Hanover into a separation or because he hoped the story, coming so soon after he announced he had cancer, would engender a sympathetic reaction? Did he deliberately channel the story to the paper usually most friendly to him?</p>
        <p>STRANGER things happen. But if this was a deliberate act of news management, it worked about as well as that deliberately set and ''controlled'' fire in Los Alamos, N.M. The story became a journalistic conflagration, aggressively pursued even in the Rudy-friendly precincts of The Post. And that prompted yet another theory: the mayor and the paper had actually fallen out of love because of The Post's critical coverage of his handling of the Patrick Dorismond shooting.</p>
        <p>The best bet, as usual, is against conspiracy. This tinder was bound to blow up somehow. Good stories don't get lost for long in the world's media capital, where the pipelines of information burst more often even than the sewers underground.</p>
        <p>Which brings us to that unwitting catalyst: Roger Friedman, an entertainment columnist for FoxNews.com. On April 28, six days after The Post took the brunch photo that had not yet appeared, he was eating dinner at Elaine's, on Second Avenue, when a friend announced that he had just seen the mayor and a woman dining alone in Cronies, a nearby restaurant.</p>
        <p>''My antenna went up,'' Mr. Friedman recalled. He wandered over to Cronies. ''Giuliani is there sitting with this brunette. I said to myself, 'O-mi-god.' It looked like something out of a movie. The mayor is out on a date. In public.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Friedman told his sometime collaborators -- Richard Johnson, the master of The Post's Page Six -- and Mr. Fink of the News. The items ran the following week.</p>
        <p>Accident? Conspiracies? Both?</p>
        <p>How about a good story waiting to be written?</p>
