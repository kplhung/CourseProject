        <p>Rapture. The Brooklyn Philharmonic's presentation of three scenes from Messiaen's opera ''St. Francois d'Assise,'' at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Saturday night, was a triumph for all concerned: the enormous orchestra spread out on a large stage, the chorus (the Westchester Oratorio Society) that brought celestial glory and strength to the close, the magnificent central soloists (David Wilson-Johnson as the Saint and Heidi Grant Murphy as the Angel), and the conductor, Robert Spano, encouraging them all to shocks of brilliance, strangeness and warmth.</p>
        <p>Every expectation was fulfilled by a performance that had long been awaited, for more than a decade has passed since any of this music was heard in New York. One has to hope the appreciative audience included some with the power and authority to bring the city a stage production of the complete work.</p>

        <p>Rapture. The Brooklyn Philharmonic's presentation of three scenes from Messiaen's opera ''St. Francois d'Assise,'' at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Saturday night, was a triumph for all concerned: the enormous orchestra spread out on a large stage, the chorus (the Westchester Oratorio Society) that brought celestial glory and strength to the close, the magnificent central soloists (David Wilson-Johnson as the Saint and Heidi Grant Murphy as the Angel), and the conductor, Robert Spano, encouraging them all to shocks of brilliance, strangeness and warmth.</p>
        <p>Every expectation was fulfilled by a performance that had long been awaited, for more than a decade has passed since any of this music was heard in New York. One has to hope the appreciative audience included some with the power and authority to bring the city a stage production of the complete work.</p>
        <p>If so, there will be no need to look far in casting the two principal roles. Mr. Wilson-Johnson not only was supremely sure throughout but also made gentleness -- which one easily takes for a quiet quality -- speak with a big, strong voice. His phrasing was smooth, beautifully paced to the orchestral performance and his sound glowed.</p>
        <p>True to the nature of Messiaen's music, he did not try to exaggerate the different emotional conditions of Francis in the two scenes of his included here: his dialogue with the Angel and his departure for heaven. (The other scene performed was that of the Angel's appearance at the young Franciscan monastery.) Everything was calm and certain, and alive.</p>
        <p>Ms. Grant Murphy was also beautifully, serenely and wonderfully consistent. And she, too, shone. Undeterred by her part's slow tempos, generously taken by Mr. Spano, she produced phrases that were finely sustained, and yet each note seemed to have a shape of its own, floating out from or into silence.</p>
        <p>Often those shapes would be defined by the vowels and consonants, as if the language itself were singing. But all of them were sweet and clear.</p>
        <p>Among those in smaller roles, John Aler repeated his unaffected and touching portrayal of Brother Masseo, familiar from the Salzburg recording. Lawrence Long, singing superbly, was warm, wise and kind as Brother Bernardo. Randall Scarlata brought out a nice naivete in Brother Leone. Michael Lockley was Brother Elia.</p>
        <p>The score is a hugely complex one to put together for one evening, and in the orchestra there were occasional marks of anxiety and indecision. But they mattered very little.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spano spurred his players to marvelous feats in the gigantic bell sounds and in the shrieks and warblings imitative of bird song. He also gave the music a strong expressive force, as at one point in Francis's opening monologue in the final scene, in which a kind of barbaric funeral march is suddenly followed by swooping, inward, blended music.</p>
        <p>Filling the air above the orchestra with azure light and dangling reflective patches was a bright idea that failed. The work is a drama and needs to be seen and heard as such, soon.</p>
