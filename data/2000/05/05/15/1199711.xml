        <p>When the American International Group, one of the world's biggest insurance companies, holds its annual meeting in New York on Wednesday, it will be confronted by several shareholder proposals challenging the dominance of Maurice R. Greenberg, its chief executive.</p>
        <p>None of the challenges is likely to prevail. Advocates rarely succeed in storming the corporate gates, and Mr. Greenberg, at 75, has for more than 30 years led what analysts say is consistently America's most profitable insurer.</p>
        <p>But experts in corporate governance say the shareholder demands that A.I.G. create a more independent board underscore the gap between A.I.G.'s management structure and prevailing practices at most American corporations. They say the structure has also allowed Mr. Greenberg to designate his 45-year-old son Evan as his successor, even though the family does not control the company.</p>
        <p>Of American International's 18 board members, 10 are company executives, including Mr. Greenberg and his son, A.I.G.'s president. Two others are consultants to the company, leaving only six truly independent directors. In contrast, more than 90 percent of American corporations have boards with a majority of independent directors.</p>
        <p>''You can't question their success and their profitability,'' said John Nash, founder of the National Association of Corporate Directors, a nonprofit group in Washington that sets standards for corporate governance. ''But let's say the company starts to go downhill. Who's going to fire Mr. Greenberg?''</p>
        <p>In its proxy statement for the meeting, A.I.G. denies that the board is run autocratically. ''Your board of directors stresses the complete participation of all members in the Board decision-making process,'' it says. A spokesman for A.I.G. said the company would have nothing to add to that.</p>
        <p>Barber B. Conable Jr., a former Congressman and past president of the World Bank who is one of the six independent board members, noted that shareholder groups have pressed for similar changes in A.I.G. governance in the past. One group last year got the support of 24 percent of the shareholders.</p>
        <p>''They make a pitiful performance,'' Mr. Conable said. ''What are these people yelling about? A.I.G. has gone from a very small company in 1969 to a corporate giant that is three jumps ahead of everybody else in the insurance business. We have some strong people among the outside people, people who are not easily rolled over.''</p>
        <p>Some experts and advocates have taken Mr. Greenberg's selection of his son as his successor as a strong sign of the senior Mr. Greenberg's hold on the company. The elder Mr. Greenberg says he has no plans to retire.</p>
        <p>For years, Mr. Greenberg, who along with other executives controls more than 20 percent of A.I.G.'s voting stock, has run the company as if it were his own. And many analysts say that has been all to the good.</p>
        <p>''This is not some guy who is milking the company,'' said Alice Schroeder, an analyst for PaineWebber who has just completed a nearly 300-page study of A.I.G. after five months of research. ''He gives the company 100 percent of his time and energy. His goal is to make A.I.G. the best company on earth, and he's very shareholder-oriented.''</p>
        <p>Still, governance experts say, A.I.G. is out of step with corporate practice. ''Board independence is critical,'' said Nell Minow, an expert on corporate governance who has co-authored three books on the subject and is editor of the Corporate Library, a Web site that publishes corporate governance information (www.thecorporatelibrary.com).</p>
        <p>''The single most important task for a board is C.E.O. succession,'' she said, ''and that task cannot be accomplished right unless the board is independent in both practice and appearance.''</p>
        <p>People who have dealt with the younger Mr. Greenberg, who did not graduate from college, say he works hard and seems devoted to the company. But they say it is difficult to compare him with his father, who is regarded with awe throughout the industry.</p>
        <p>''The son has yet to be proven,'' said Charles Elson, a specialist in corporate governance at the Stetson University law school. ''That's not to say the son won't be good. But you'd feel a lot more comfortable if a non-management dominated group had approved the succession.''</p>
        <p>One group raising a challenge is the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), which wants A.I.G. to establish a committee of independent board members to select future board members.</p>
        <p>''Decision making at A.I.G. is a very closed process dominated by one individual, and we do not think that is healthy in the long term,'' said William Samplatsky-Jarman, who is in charge of corporate responsibility at the Presbyterian Church.</p>
        <p>In her report on A.I.G., Ms. Schroeder depicts a robust company poised for further growth. Its compound annual return since going public in 1969 has been about 20 percent, Ms. Schroeder said, compared with just over 9 percent for the S.&amp; P. 500-stock index.</p>
        <p>At about $115 a share, the company is trading at more than five times book value, or about twice the level of most other insurers. And its market capitalization of about $178 billion is nearly twice as great as the next closest insurer, the German company Allianz, at about $91 billion.</p>
        <p>A.I.G., with assets of $268 billion, is the nation's leading commercial insurer, with growing businesses in life insurance and auto coverage. With operations in 130 countries, it is by far the most global of American insurers. A.I.G. also runs a big aircraft leasing business that provides planes to the major airlines and operates pension and asset management businesses.</p>
        <p>Ms. Schroeder, who previously distinguished herself with detailed studies of Berkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate run by Warren E. Buffett, said A.I.G.'s single greatest competitive advantage is the solid grounding it has in so many countries. ''In many markets,'' she said in her report, which is being sold for $500 a copy to people who are not clients of PaineWebber, ''A.I.G. may well be the only foreign insurer that can successfully go head to head with local companies and take share profitably.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenberg, who serves as chairman of the Asia Society in New York, travels heavily, often to China and other parts of Asia, where his close ties to political leaders have given him opportunities to begin selling insurance while competitors were waiting for official approval.</p>
        <p>Ms. Schroeder, who upgraded her rating of A.I.G. shares from ''attractive'' to ''buy'' with the issuance of the report, said three things could cause A.I.G. to stumble as an investment -- a global downturn, big regulatory or political changes in the countries where it operates or ''a management succession that is poorly timed or executed.''</p>
        <p>In her analysis, Ms. Schroeder focused on the process of transferring power from Mr. Greenberg to his son rather than on the questions raised by activist shareholders and governance experts about whether there was sufficiently wide participation in the choice of a new chief executive.</p>
        <p>''As the company's business becomes more developed in certain critical countries such as China and India, the risk in the transition should be mitigated,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Greenberg has gotten licenses in those countries based partly on personal relations developed over many years. Once he's got developed businesses going in those countries, some of the risk of losing those relationships goes away. We believe he is also working to graft some of those relationships onto his successor.''</p>
        <p>Some of the challengers plan to demonstrate outside A.I.G.'s headquarters in lower Manhattan on Wednesday dressed in revolutionary-era costumes, accompanied by fife and drum.</p>
        <p>''Corporate independence is our theme, playing off some of the themes in the original Declaration of Independence,'' said Scott Klinger, co-director of Responsible Wealth, a nonprofit organization in Boston whose members say they are among the wealthiest 5 percent of Americans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klinger's group is asking that A.I.G. begin nominating 50 percent more candidates for board seats than the seats available, something no company in America now does. ''We filed this resolution,'' Mr. Klinger said, ''to provoke discussion and debate about the way directors are elected. We picked A.I.G. because it is one of the few remaining large companies that do not have an independent board.''</p>
