        <p>Two technology advertisers made decisions on accounts.</p>
        <p>Handspring Inc. named Leo Burnett USA in Chicago, part of the B Com3  Group, to handle the account for its Visor hand-held digital assistant. Billings were estimated at $15 million to $20 million.</p>
        <p>Claire Dean, a spokeswoman for Handspring in Mountain View, Calif., said the decision came after a four-week review that had been narrowed to Burnett and one other agency she declined to identify. The account had been handled by Butler, Shine &amp; Stern in Sausalito, Calif., for about nine months.</p>
        <p>Separately, the Unisys Corporation is placing its global account into review, after re-evaluating its relationship with its agency of eight years, the Bozell Group, part of True North Communications. Billings were estimated at more than $20 million.</p>
        <p>Kerry Baker, a spokesman for Unisys in Blue Bell, Pa., said the review was a result of last month's decision by the Compaq Computer Corporation, a Unisys competitor, to select  FCB Worldwide, another True North agency. But he added that Bozell would be invited to participate in the review because Bozell may have ''some other alternatives they will propose to relieve our concerns.'' The other agencies that will be invited to pitch the business have not been determined.</p>
        <p>Executives at Bozell in New York could not be reached for comment.</p>
