        <p>Westchester County plans to file a lawsuit today seeking to stop Consolidated Edison from increasing electric bills to cover costs from a radioactive leak at a nuclear plant in February, the county executive said.</p>
        <p>In addition to suing Con Edison, the county plans to sue the Public Service Commission, which it says has failed to act on the county's petition to prohibit the utility from passing on costs from the accident at the Indian Point 2 plant in Buchanan, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Since April, consumers have been charged an additional $2 a month on average to cover the $600,000 a day Con Edison says it is spending to buy replacement power from other utilities because the plant is closed.</p>
        <p>Con Edison, which serves New York City and most of Westchester, closed the plant on Feb. 15 after a tube in a steam generator leaked a small amount of radioactive water. Officials at the utility have said the leak did not endanger the public.</p>
        <p>The incident, which is being investigated by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, has enraged elected officials and environmentalists, many of whom say the plant, 35 miles north of Manhattan, should be permanently closed.</p>
        <p>County officials said yesterday that they thought Con Edison should not be permitted to levy the charge because officials of the company have acknowledged to regulators that it had replacement generators on hand since 1987 but never installed them, apparently to save money.</p>
        <p>''We think it is a no-brainer; they caused the problem,'' County Executive Andrew Spano said in an interview yesterday. ''This is not an unexpected cost. This is a problem they were able to make a decision on years ago, and obviously made the wrong decision.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Con Edison said yesterday that the company would  respond only in court.</p>
        <p>David Flanagan, a spokesman for the Public Service Commission, said a lawsuit would be premature because the commission is already reviewing the surcharge as part of a ''prudency hearing'' it initiated in March under a petition from a group of legislators and consumers. If it ruled against the utility, consumers would get a refund. Mr. Flanagan said it was not known when a decision would be made.</p>
        <p>Shortly after the commission granted the hearing -- but refused to immediately halt the surcharge -- the county filed its own petition asking the commission to stay the increase. Alan D. Scheinkman, the county attorney, said the commission had 30 days to respond -- May 4 was the deadline -- but never did, prompting the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat who is chairman of the Assembly Committee on Environmental Conservation, pushed for the prudency hearing, and said yesterday that he thought it stood the best chance of succeeding. He said Con Edison has offered to settle the case and negotiations were beginning.</p>
        <p>Given that development, ''Perhaps the most productive work is through the prudency hearing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But other county officials said they were outraged Con Edison has been allowed to charge consumers for what they say is the utility's own mistake. Allowing Con Edison to pass on the expense before a hearing  to determine if the charges are justified is ''putting the cart before the horse,'' Mr. Spano said.</p>
