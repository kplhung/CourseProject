        <p>One of the top American commanders in the Persian Gulf war came under investigation in 1991 after a member of his unit complained that his troops had pummeled retreating Iraqi forces in an unprovoked attack two days after a cease-fire went into effect.</p>
        <p>Military investigators, who completed a secret report in 1991, had exonerated the commander, Barry McCaffrey, now a retired four-star Army general and President Clinton's top drug control official. And General McCaffrey says he is the victim of a journalist's attack.</p>
