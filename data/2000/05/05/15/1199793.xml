        <p>Kid Koala</p>
        <p>Bowery Ballroom</p>
        <p>Being a disc jockey is usually a lonely job, the province of one person behind the turntables. But last Monday night, Kid Koala, from Montreal, turned his set into a social event. While he played part of the set alone, using up to four turntables at a time, he also worked with another disc jockey from Montreal, P-Love, and he scratched along with his own funk band, Bullfrog.</p>
        <p>Through it all, the music was cheerful. Kid Koala is a turntablist who scratches records into percussion solos, making them chirp, bubble, ratchet and cackle. He is also a collector of unlikely music and spoken-word sound bites that sometimes comment on what he is up to: ''The cut-up experiments appear random,'' a voice intoned. And under it all he placed one suave, low-slung funk groove after another.</p>

        <p>Kid Koala</p>
        <p>Bowery Ballroom</p>
        <p>Being a disc jockey is usually a lonely job, the province of one person behind the turntables. But last Monday night, Kid Koala, from Montreal, turned his set into a social event. While he played part of the set alone, using up to four turntables at a time, he also worked with another disc jockey from Montreal, P-Love, and he scratched along with his own funk band, Bullfrog.</p>
        <p>Through it all, the music was cheerful. Kid Koala is a turntablist who scratches records into percussion solos, making them chirp, bubble, ratchet and cackle. He is also a collector of unlikely music and spoken-word sound bites that sometimes comment on what he is up to: ''The cut-up experiments appear random,'' a voice intoned. And under it all he placed one suave, low-slung funk groove after another.</p>
        <p>At one point Kid Koala manipulated a single note from a trombone to play a full-length jazz solo. He recreated his cassette release ''Scratchcratchratchatch'' as a duet with P-Love, topping its grooves with erhu (Chinese violin), crotchety voices and call-and-response scratching. Bullfrog substituted live funk vamps for vinyl ones, then roamed through Latin American rhythms from samba to salsa.</p>
        <p>Unlike more self-effacing disc jockeys, Kid Koala spoke to the crowd and fully enjoyed his own music, grinning whenever he pulled off a flashy stretch of scratching.</p>
        <p>Amon Tobin, who shared the bill, was a solo disc jockey, too busy with his vinyl to work the crowd. His albums are denser and more atmospheric than most disc-jockey recordings, and his set flaunted diversity. He used three-chord rock guitars, filtered and speed-altered raps, echoing film-noirish chords and exuberant swing-style drumming, layered in on itself.</p>
