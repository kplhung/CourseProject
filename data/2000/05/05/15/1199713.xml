        <p>They call Jon Alpert a cowboy, a guerrilla. He's the kind of filmmaker who, as he puts it, has ''an inner drive that makes you think you have to be wherever important things are happening.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Alpert was speaking at the Museum of Television and Radio's first festival devoted to documentary films made for television, where he was being honored as a founder of the modern documentary, a filmmaker who has taken technological innovations and run with them, lugging his Sony PortaPak camera into Cambodia to document the atrocities of Pol Pot, traveling with the Sandanistas in Nicaragua, with rebels in the Philippines, with the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan.</p>
        <p>The festival runs through Saturday at the museum, at 25 West 52nd Street in Manhattan. (Information: 212-621-6600.) It includes an overview of television documentary filmmaking in the United States, from Mr. Alpert's work, with its sometimes shocking immediacy, to the elegant historical films of Ken Burns and David Grubin.</p>
        <p>There was a preview of scenes from Mr. Burns's 19 hour series, ''Jazz,'' to be broadcast on PBS in January 2001 and the premier of Mr. Grubin's six-part ''Abraham and Mary Lincoln: A House Divided,'' a dual biography of the couple, to be shown on PBS in February 2001. Parts 5 and 6 of that film will be shown at the museum on Tuesday .</p>
        <p>On Friday and Saturday the first screenings are to be held of ''Sam Phillips: The Man Who Invented Rock 'n' Roll,'' by Peter Jones, Morgan Neville and Peter Guralnick. One of the festival's previously broadcast films, ''Dying to Tell the Story,'' by Amy and Kathy Eldon, Victoria Waldock and Kyra Thompson, will be shown on Saturday and Sunday. In the film Amy Eldon interviews foreign correspondents in an effort to understand the life and work of her brother, Dan, a photographer stoned to death with three other journalists in Somalia in 1993.</p>
        <p>Documentary filmmaking today is going through a renaissance, said Ron Simon, the festival's curator. It began with the popularity of Mr. Burns's 1990 ''Civil War.'' MTV's ''Real World,' the real-life soap opera about young people living together, constitutes a type of documentary and shows it ''to be a very adaptable form,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Documentaries, which are cheaper to produce than dramas, can capture ''those little epiphanies of life that are not seen as much in feature films,'' Mr. Simon said.</p>
        <p>In 1971 Mr. Alpert and his wife, Keiko Tsuno, founded the Downtown Community Television Center in Chinatown to make political-action documentaries. And since then most of his work has had a political edge. Instead of film cameras, they used PortaPaks, portable video cameras and recorders. Video was cheaper and provided instant playback. But the cameras were still heavy and required lights, and the videotape was cut with a razor, creating a flash on the screen.</p>
        <p>In 1974 Mr. Alpert got his first color PortaPak, a breakthrough ''because the networks wouldn't accept black and white,'' he said. His film about Cuba was broadcast on PBS. In 1979 he was filming Sandanista rebels in Nicaragua when his sound man announced he was scared and was going home.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alpert strapped the microphone to the camera top and became a one-man crew, creating a new immediacy. ''I realized they were looking into the camera into the audience at home,'' Mr. Alpert said. ''It did away with the reporter who would normally act like a football lineman blocking the view.''</p>
        <p>As cameras became lighter and video more refined, Mr. Alpert could move faster and do away with intrusive lighting. During the war in El Salvador he brought a generator to recharge camera batteries. In 1992 he began using the Sony Hi-8 format, which consumed less power and had smaller tapes. He was able to smuggle videos past Iraqi censors during the Persian Gulf war. Now, with computerized machines, editing video has also become easier.</p>
        <p>The filmmaking techniques of Mr. Grubin, whose documentary on the Lincolns had its premiere at the festival, are almost opposite those of Mr. Alpert. Mr. Grubin, who has made documentaries on Theodore and Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson, said in an interview that he was ''trying to go back into some of the classical techniques of feature films and bring them to documentary history filmmaking.''</p>
        <p>Above all, Mr. Grubin said, he tries to tell a story, and to create a dramatic arc. He uses atmospheric lighting, evocative shots of landscape, background music, a far cry from the deliberate roughness of cinema verite. For ''Lincoln'' he used a wide-screen format typical of feature films. In depicting Lincoln's assassination, he used another technique borrowed from features, a studio shot of a bullet in extreme slow motion.</p>
        <p>Unlike Mr. Grubin, the creators of the documentary on Sam Phillips, founder of Sun records and an early supporter of Elvis Presley, deliberately avoided traditional techniques, said Mr. Neville, the film's director. ''We decided there would be no archival footage unless it was directly related,'' he said. ''It's done so often it's a cliche.'' There are no interviews with experts, he said, or with young people influenced by the music, common in rock documentaries.  The scenes were deliberately raw, because ''so often people overproduce,'' Mr. Neville said. He wanted to duplicate the sense in a Sun record of ''something actually happening.'' The film will be broadcast on June 18 on A&amp;E.</p>
        <p>Mr. Alpert said that documentarians would soon broadcast work on the Internet. And beginning in June, he said, the Downtown Community TV Center, using public access, will broadcast an experimental interactive documentary, with residents of a homeless shelter feeding live video back to the center over the Internet.</p>
        <p>''It's basically talk radio for television,'' Mr. Alpert said, ''which makes it as revolutionary as the first time we walked into Chinatown with our PortaPaks.''</p>
