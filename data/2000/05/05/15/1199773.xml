        <p>The woman standing at the podium said, ''It's really great to see how the press cares about kids.''</p>
        <p>Laughter erupted from the mob of reporters and photographers who showed up at a public school on the Lower East Side last Thursday. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani was there to promote a children's food drive. The press was there for the moment when the mayor would begin to entertain questions. The food drive and the children were ignored. This was a matter for responsible adults. Well, for adults anyway.</p>
        <p>''Down in front!'' yelled the video camera operators. ''That's my seat,'' complained a television reporter. A feeding frenzy was under way. Blood had been drawn. The mayor had been wounded. And the sharks of the New York media had gathered en masse.</p>
        <p>The mayor began the briefing by saying, ''I'm not going to answer anybody that's screaming.''</p>
        <p>The first question was: ''Respectfully, your wife has accused you of having an affair with Cristyne Lategano. Did you?''</p>
        <p>Other questions were: Do you sleep at Gracie Mansion? Was your wife lying? Are you politically dead?</p>
        <p>The mayor looked tired. Except for a Nixonian smile that he flashed and held for a few seconds whenever it seemed necessary, his mouth was set in a grim and rigid downward arc. His face was drawn and gray, his high forehead pale. This was not the Rudolph Giuliani of a thousand prior press conferences. This was a man who seemed depressed and somehow diminished. Much less self-assured. Combative still, but finally vulnerable.</p>
        <p>Except for the devastating diagnosis of prostate cancer, most of the mayor's problems over the past few months were in some sense self-imposed. He has been running for the Senate like an amateur, or a man desperately afraid he might win.</p>
        <p>When Patrick Dorismond, an unarmed man who had committed no crime, was killed by an undercover detective, the mayor relentlessly badmouthed Mr. Dorismond, thus playing into the hands of political opponents anxious to portray Mr. Giuliani as insensitive and even cruel. When he was criticized for criticizing Mr. Dorismond, the mayor went on national television and criticized him some more.</p>
        <p>Last month the mayor gave voters outside New York City a glimpse of his priorities when he canceled an upstate campaign swing to attend the home opener at Yankee Stadium. If he was concerned about the signal that sent to folks in places like Binghamton and Rochester, he didn't let on.</p>
        <p>''The Yankees don't open every day,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The mayor handled the cancer diagnosis with great dignity, but soon after that came the Judith Nathan fiasco. It was one thing for Mr. Giuliani, who has long had a strained relationship with his wife, Donna Hanover, to disclose that he had a close friendship with another woman. But it was something else entirely to declare at a press conference -- apparently without telling Ms. Hanover -- that he and his wife would pursue a formal separation.</p>
        <p>''He blindsided her,'' said a top state Republican, ''and that was both dumb and cruel.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani is not dumb. So why is he doing these things?</p>
        <p>Last Friday night the mayor infuriated top Republicans by taking a spectacularly public 10-block stroll with Ms. Nathan from a restaurant where they had dinner to her Upper East Side apartment building. (She kissed him on the cheek and he left, with the press trailing him.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's personal life is most certainly his own business. But his behavior recently is politically inexplicable. The degree of self-destruction at work is breathtaking. He is like a military officer directing artillery fire onto his own position.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani is ruining his relationship with the Republican Party, where he is increasingly seen as a toxic presence. A prominent elected official told me over the weekend, ''The sooner we get rid of the guy the better.''</p>
        <p>He has shaken the confidence of his most ardent supporters in the electorate, and has allowed himself to become a target for ridicule by comedians across the country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani seems bent on destroying not only his Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton, but his entire political future. He is becoming a joke, but not a funny one.</p>
