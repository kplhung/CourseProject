        <p>If what local investigators suspect is true, the virus that brought some of the world's most sophisticated computer networks to a halt this month was hatched in a noisy inner-city neighborhood where residents live under corrugated steel roofs and raise fighting cocks in their front yards.</p>
        <p>It was in a two-bedroom apartment on the ground floor of a grubby concrete apartment building that an unremarkable programming student named Onel A. de Guzman lived with his sister Irene and her boyfriend, Reonel Ramones.</p>
        <p>There, Mr. de Guzman worked on his college thesis: a program designed to help fellow Filipinos gain free access to the Internet by harvesting passwords from paying subscribers. He said last week that he might have inadvertently unleashed the program that on May 4 spread to computers around the world disguised as an innocuous e-mail message titled ''I Love You,'' costing by some estimates $10 billion in lost data and productivity.</p>
        <p>That the world's most infectious computer virus to date could have such origins illustrates how the Internet's global sprawl has left the network vulnerable to disruption from even its most remote technological backwaters.</p>
        <p>For the Philippines, on the other hand, the ''Love Bug'' and the hacker subculture that it exposed are an embarrassing advertisement of the country's programming talent and infant dot-com scene. They also raised the issue of the cost of Internet access for developing countries struggling to close a daunting technology gap with richer countries.</p>
        <p>While maintaining that he meant no harm, Mr. de Guzman said that Internet access should be free and that charging for its use was immoral. In his thesis, which his college rejected, he introduced his program by saying it would help many people ''spend more time on the Internet without paying.''</p>
        <p>To understand the grudging admiration people here have shown for Mr. de Guzman, Internet executives say it helps to understand the public's reverence for a more low-tech Filipino innovation, a vehicle known as the jeepney.</p>
        <p>Jeepneys made their first appearance after World War II, hand-built from liberated Japanese equipment and United States Army jeeps of dubious provenance. The ungainly utility vehicles transformed four-seat machines of war into gaudily decorated, smog-belching conveyances for as many as 22 commuters.</p>
        <p>Maligned these days as unsafe and environmentally unsound, the colorful jeepney survives on Philippine roads as cheap public transport and a symbol of Filipino ingenuity.</p>
        <p>''It's like the jeepney,'' Zenisa Perez, an analyst at the Manila office of the International Data Corporation, a computer research company, said of the Mr. de Guzman's program. ''He made do with what he has.''</p>
        <p>In a country where the gap between rich and poor is enormous, Filipinos say, the jeepney ethos has moved beyond transportation to inspire a kind of subculture of proletarian larceny. Poor Filipinos commonly tap into everything from power lines to cable television.</p>
        <p>The Business Software Alliance, a United States trade group that fights software piracy, estimates that about 77 percent of the software used in the Philippines is pirated.</p>
        <p>Like commercially written software, the Internet is considered by many Filipinos to be unjustly expensive. While customers in the United States and other developed countries can use it at negligible cost, or even free, Internet services here charge nearly $1.50 an hour.</p>
        <p>Why so expensive? Limited competition for international telecommunications links keeps Internet access more than four times as expensive as in the United States. Making matters worse, poor domestic telephone lines mean that the fastest connections here are still roughly 50 times slower than the best lines available to Internet users in the United States. Most Filipinos do not even have a telephone, much less a personal computer.</p>
        <p>At the school that Mr. de Guzman attended, Amable Mendoza Aguiluz Computer College, the situation is even more challenging. The school has 150 branches around the country, though it has yet to be accredited. Many of its instructors are recent graduates, and Mr. de Guzman's campus in Manila is in a former warehouse without flush toilets.</p>
        <p>It is no M.I.T., but to its 15,000 students it holds the promise of a lucrative career, perhaps even the chance to work in the United States.</p>
        <p>For example, Myra Deguro, an 18-year-old junior, grew up in a home without a phone. She hopes to turn her computer science degree into a secretarial job if she does not land a position in a high-tech company.</p>
        <p>Ms. Deguro is fortunate: her father is a driver for a wealthy Manila family, which is paying her annual tuition and laboratory fees of about $1,500. Other students, she says, end up taking time off so they can save enough money to graduate.</p>
        <p>Students say Internet access is a precious commodity. College labs limit them to several prescribed hours among a limited number of computers, many of which are incapacitated at any given time by unsuccessful student programs or successful student viruses. That leaves Internet cafes, which offer a more reliable, though expensive, alternative.</p>
        <p>Mr. de Guzman, students say, is just part of a lively Filipino hacker community that has sprung up to circumvent such obstacles. In addition to selling homework projects, they say, hackers often circulate purloined account information among the student body.</p>
        <p>One of several local hacker sites, the Pinoy Virus Writers Web site, declares: ''Information will be free for everyone. Information will be fed to those in need. Information shall never again be sealed.''</p>
        <p>Not all of the students applaud the hackers' sentiments. The college administration is also not amused. It said Saturday that it would seek disciplinary action against Mr. de Guzman and the nine other members of a group of student programmers named Grammersoft, whose name appeared in the ''I Love You'' virus's code. Grammersoft's members, two of whom have reportedly already gone off to work in the United States, deny any involvement in the case. One group member, Michael Buen, appeared at a news conference today to declare his innocence. Mr. de Guzman and his lawyer could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>But the police have not formally named any suspects in the suspected misdeed, which so far does not appear to be an explicit crime under Philippine law. Legislators are pushing for a new law that would make a crime of unauthorized entry of computer networks.</p>
        <p>The only charge pending is against Mr. de Guzman's roommate, Mr. Ramones, contending that he violated a law against misusing passwords.</p>
