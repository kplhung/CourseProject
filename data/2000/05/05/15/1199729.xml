        <p>With a police helicopter hovering noisily overhead and the sound of wild cheering coursing through the stands, Magnus Norman won his first significant tennis tournament today, one day after he replaced Andre Agassi as the leader in the yearlong points race.</p>
        <p>But the helicopter and the joyful cheers were not for Norman or for Gustavo Kuerten, the Brazilian whom he beat, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, in the final of this Masters Series event formerly known as the Italian Open.</p>

        <p>With a police helicopter hovering noisily overhead and the sound of wild cheering coursing through the stands, Magnus Norman won his first significant tennis tournament today, one day after he replaced Andre Agassi as the leader in the yearlong points race.</p>
        <p>But the helicopter and the joyful cheers were not for Norman or for Gustavo Kuerten, the Brazilian whom he beat, 6-3, 4-6, 6-4, 6-4, in the final of this Masters Series event formerly known as the Italian Open.</p>
        <p>The helicopter was there to keep watch on the fans in the adjacent Olympic Stadium who watched Lazio, a Roman soccer team, play Reggina on the final day of the Italian First Division season. Those fans ended up celebrating throughout the afternoon and far into the evening after Lazio, with its 3-0 victory, won its first league title in 26 years.</p>
        <p>Foro Italico's Center Court stands were not entirely full, and the spectators who were there kept twisting their heads and asking their neighbors if they knew the score next door.</p>
        <p>But then, Norman would not have minded knowing it himself. He hails from the same region in central Sweden as Lazio's coach, Sven Goran Eriksson, and supports Lazio because of that.</p>
        <p>''A great day for Swedish sport,'' said Norman, who had surgery in 1997 to correct a heart-valve defect.</p>
        <p>This was certainly the greatest day and week in Norman's career. He had previously won eight tournaments, but those victories had come in minor events in Amsterdam, Croatia, Shanghai and, most recently, New Zealand. But this was Rome: one of the capitals of the clay-court game that Norman's physical baseline style suits so well.</p>
        <p>Norman is not No. 1 in the traditional sense that Bjorn Borg, Stefan Edberg and Mats Wilander were. The ranking system that counted a player's best results over the previous 52 weeks has given way this year to a season-long points race that will only produce a bonafide No. 1 in December. But Norman's 6-3, 6-0 demolition of Lleyton Hewitt in Saturday's semifinals did put him ahead of Agassi in the standing.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to say I'm No. 1 in the world; I'm leading the race,'' Norman said. ''And that's something that I never would have dreamed about after four or five months of the season, so I'm obviously very proud of that.''</p>
