        <p>The death today of former Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who had been in a coma since suffering a stroke six weeks ago, is expected to play a major role in general elections that the governing Liberal Democratic Party plans to call next month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Obuchi, who was succeeded in April by Yoshiro Mori as prime minister and party leader, died this afternoon in Juntendo University Hospital in Tokyo, the prime minister's office said. Mr. Obuchi's doctors said that the 62-year-old career politician had succumbed to a cerebral infarction resulting from the stroke.</p>
        <p>Public sympathy for Mr. Obuchi, whose quiet personal warmth, political savvy and efforts to jump-start Japan's struggling economy as prime minister had made him popular with voters, could help the party regain a majority in Parliament, political analysts said. Party leaders have said they hope to hold elections for the lower house on Mr. Obuchi's birthday, June 25.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Obuchi's commitment to reforming the economy and his very kind and father-like image impressed many Japanese,'' said Takeshi Sasaki, a professor of political science at Tokyo University. ''Most people thought he was a good and decent man and that's something that the L.D.P. is likely to capitalize on.''</p>
        <p>It would not be the first time that the governing party had benefited from a sympathy vote. Following a fractious split in 1980, the party made a triumphant comeback, winning a majority in both houses, after the death of Prime Minister Masayoshi Ohira from a heart attack in the middle of the campaign.</p>
        <p>But the political opposition could also benefit from Mr. Obuchi's death, which has revived charges that the  government deliberately deceived the public by releasing misleading information and disguising the gravity of Mr. Obuchi's condition in the days following his stroke.</p>
        <p>Concern over that issue was revived today, when doctors said in a news conference that they doubted that after being admitted to the hospital on April 2, Mr. Obuchi had been  in any condition to instruct the chief cabinet secretary, Mikio Aoki, to take charge of the government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aoki has said that Mr. Obuchi told him: ''In case something should happen to me, please take care of everything.'' On that basis, Mr. Aoki declared himself acting prime minister and dissolved the government, clearing the way for Mr. Mori to be elected Mr. Obuchi's successor.</p>
        <p>The team of five doctors, who said that Mr. Obuchi's family had given them permission to speak to the news media, said that while the former prime minister was conscious and could utter a few words following the stroke, he could not string together long sentences.</p>
        <p>''It was difficult for Obuchi to clearly speak long sentences, but I guess he could have said 'please take care' or thrown in words indicating agreement,'' said Dr. Yoshikuni Mizuno, one of the team physicians.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Mizuno added that he had been ''surprised'' at Mr. Aoki's statement about Mr. Obuchi's request, considering the former prime minister's condition.</p>
        <p>Until today, the events following Mr. Obuchi's collapse had been shrouded in secrecy, with senior members of his party only grudgingly releasing scant details and his doctors declining to comment. For the first 22 hours following his stroke, the government hid Mr. Obuchi's condition from the public, as party leaders worked out succession issues in secret.</p>
        <p>At the news conference today, the doctors said that Mr. Obuchi fell ill at his residence at about 11 p.m. on April 1. He was admitted to the hospital two hours later, at around 1 a.m. on April 2. At about 2 p.m., after several examinations, it was finally  determined that he had suffered a stroke.</p>
        <p>Mr. Aoki went to the hospital to see Mr. Obuchi, the doctors said, and after that, Mr. Obuchi began losing consciousness because his brain was hemorrhaging. He fell into a coma that evening and was placed on a respirator.</p>
        <p>In the weeks that followed, Mr. Obuchi developed numerous complications from the stroke, including low blood pressure and various infections. His heart stopped beating today, they said.</p>
        <p>A wake will be held for Mr. Obuchi on Monday and a private funeral on Tuesday, the former prime minister's aides said. A state funeral is also being planned, but no date has been set.</p>
        <p>The uncertainty over political succession set off by Mr. Obuchi's disability has still to be resolved. Japanese law specifies that the prime minister should select a temporary replacement if incapacitated, but it gives no other specifics.</p>
        <p>In an effort to avoid the crisis that occurred last month over Mr. Obuchi's stroke, Mr. Mori, the recently elected prime minister, announced a plan of succession should he become disabled. The first one in line is his chief cabinet secretary, Mr. Aoki, followed by Foreign Minister Yohei Kono.</p>
