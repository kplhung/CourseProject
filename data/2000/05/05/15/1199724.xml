        <p>The inauguration of a reform-minded judge as Turkey's 10th president on Tuesday will cap a year of extraordinary change here.</p>
        <p>Ahmet Necdet Sezer, who had been chief justice of Turkey's highest court, favors repeal of laws that limit free speech. These laws have been used to imprison journalists and politicians who voice what are considered subversive views.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sezer has also called for an end to the ban on teaching and broadcasting in the Kurdish language. He wants every government agency, including the military, to submit to what he calls ''the rule of law.''</p>
        <p>These views have made Mr. Sezer a hero to Turks who want to modernize their country's political system. They hope that he will use his platform to push Turkey toward full democracy.</p>
        <p>''This gentleman believes Turkey has to change,'' said Ilter Turan, a political scientist who is rector of Bilgi University in Istanbul. ''The fact that he could become president shows that the country has lost or is losing its fear of change.''</p>
        <p>But the choice of Mr. Sezer is a turning point not only because of his own opinions. It is also the latest in a series of events that, taken together, suggest that Turkey may be ready to embrace political reform.</p>
        <p>Turkey was in crisis as recently as 1997, when military commanders pushed an Islamic-oriented prime minister out of office because they feared he was leading the country toward religious fundamentalism.</p>
        <p>During that period, political parties and their leaders were at each other's throats. War against Kurdish rebels was raging in eastern provinces. The inflation rate approached 100 percent annually, one of the highest in the world. And in a humiliating defeat, the European Union refused even to consider Turkey's application for membership.</p>
        <p>Much of that has now changed. Last year Bulent Ecevit formed what has proved to be a remarkably stable government, pulling the country out of political chaos.</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Ecevit persuaded the International Monetary Fund to support a $4 billion stabilization program under which state enterprises are being privatized and the inflation rate has begun to fall. Equally impressive, he pushed the program through Parliament despite howls of protest from groups that had benefited from lavish subsidies.</p>
        <p>Soon afterward, Mr. Ecevit announced to a stunned nation the capture of Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdish rebellion.</p>
        <p>At his trial, Mr. Ocalan called on his rebels to stop fighting. Nearly all  have done so, ending a 15-year war that killed tens of thousands, deeply polarized Turkish society, and turned the country into a virtual pariah in the West.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ocalan was sentenced to death, but the sentence has not been carried out. Mr. Ecevit resisted emotional demands for a quick execution, persuading his compatriots that the satisfaction of hanging Mr. Ocalan was not worth the outrage it would stir abroad.</p>
        <p>Soon after Mr. Ocalan's capture, western Turkey was struck by a devastating earthquake for which the  government proved unprepared. But scores of grass-roots civic groups sprang into action, and they have since greatly invigorated civil society and attracted thousands of dynamic citizens into the political process.</p>
        <p>President Clinton's visit to the earthquake zone, and the enthusiasm with which he embraced victims and empathized with their plight, led many Turks to wonder why they too could not have young and vigorous political leaders. His example may have led indirectly to growing dissatisfaction with 75-year-old President Suleyman Demirel, who failed in his attempt to change the Constitution so he could run for re-election.</p>
        <p>Relief workers from Greece were among the first to come to Turkey's aid after the earthquake, and when a quake struck Greece a few weeks later, Turks flew there to return the favor.</p>
        <p>Then, in a turnaround that thrilled nearly every Turk, the European Union reversed itself and agreed to accept Turkey as a candidate for membership.</p>
