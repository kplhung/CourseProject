        <p>SOMETIMES, even when it's the Knicks against the Heat, against all the odds, one player breaks free. Getting past the roadblocks and the defenses and the mirror-image familiarities, he manages to have himself a game.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, in the course of yet another of those grinding marathons, a most unlikely individualist emerged, breaking the game open, pumping his fist to the banners above.</p>
        <p>It was none other than Charlie Ward, the player who gives witness to his faith, letting the crowd know he was proud of what had just transpired.</p>
        <p>Ward normally plays impassively, his eyes curiously averted downward, as if he were just filling a role. But yesterday, in the midst of the physicality, he dashed around as if he had a license to dominate.</p>
        <p>''Man, I felt like I should have my own team,'' Ward said later, with a big smile.</p>
        <p>This is a rare public show of humor and totally allowable ego. Ward is neither a superstar nor one of those bantam-rooster point guards who must assert themselves every time down the court or feel a loss of their manhood. He's the quiet man, which made his celebration even more exotic.</p>
        <p>He certainly picked his spot for his display of emotion, scoring 20 points, his highest total in 53 career playoff games, including the last 9 points for the Knicks to conclude a 91-83 victory to even the series at two games each.</p>
        <p>Ward was the catalyst for a game that brought Miami back to square one, leaving Alonzo Mourning admitting to his own here-we-go-again feeling. Mourning blamed his own mistakes, but it was the Knicks' straight-man point guard who took advantage of them.</p>
        <p>He was a football quarterback once, winning the Heisman Trophy and the national championship for Florida State in the 1993 season, and he plays this sport with the same ''fearless mentality,'' as Latrell Sprewell put it, diving for loose balls, going for rebounds.</p>
        <p>But the other Knicks still have to remind him that aggression in basketball can include creative selfishness, looking for your main chance.</p>
        <p>''The coaching staff and my teammates asked me and told me to attack,'' Ward said afterward, adding that his knees feel better than they have at times, and that that enabled him to play free and loose.</p>
        <p>His best sequence began with 2 minutes 8 seconds left in the game, with the Knicks up by 5. Trapped in the right corner, Ward saved a loose ball, going up in the air while hurtling out of bounds, finding an open teammate, like a quarterback on a busted play.</p>
        <p>The ball worked around to him again. With 1:51 left, he went up for a shot and was whacked by Anthony Carter, but controlled his balance to get off a shot that glanced off the backboard for a field goal.</p>
        <p>Ward added a 2-point field goal and a 3-pointer, each time responding with a little more fire, fitting in with his chest-bumping, palm-bashing teammates.</p>
        <p>''You don't see it from him very often,'' said Chris Childs, the more emotional point guard who has been playing relatively few minutes in recent games.</p>
        <p>''I got chills just watching because I was so happy for him,'' Childs added. ''He made some unbelievable plays, but when he is aggressive like that, and they are not respecting him, he hits those shots. Now I am pretty sure they will change their game plan, and not double as much.''</p>
        <p>They all enjoyed watching Ward step out of character. First, most of the Knicks met for the postgame prayer at center court, and when they returned to their lockers, they chanted ''Char-lie! Char-lie! Char-lie!'' The reception seemed to open him up, breaking down his normal reserve.</p>
        <p>''For the first time, I felt like Allan and Latrell,'' he said with a smile. ''You know, like you are the go-to guy. But I know that is not going to happen every night, and I am just very grateful for the opportunity.''</p>
        <p>Asked if he had ever heard his name chanted like that before, Ward replied, ''At my house.'' He claimed that his 11-week-old son, Caleb Charles, had been calling his name ''because he was sleepy'' the night before.</p>
        <p>As it turned out, Ward's wife, Tonja, brought their son to his first game to celebrate Mother's Day together.</p>
        <p>''I think he was asleep the whole game,'' Ward said, ''but I am just very happy that he was able to come and be part of something special, not just for me but for my team.''</p>
        <p>One day Caleb will watch film clips of his first game, watch his father tossing up shots, taking over the game, pumping his fists. Caleb will know this is not the way Wards normally behave.</p>
        <p>However, once in a while, there is room for some unencumbered celebration of personal excellence, even in the scrum of a Knicks-Heat game.</p>
