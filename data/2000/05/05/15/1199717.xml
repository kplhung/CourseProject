        <p>IN this season of comeuppance for Internet-only retailers, catalog companies that also sell on the Web may finally be getting their due.</p>
        <p>Even as the stock prices of so-called ''pure play'' electronic retailers spiked last Christmas season, the e-tailers acknowledged that they would still need to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on marketing and warehouses to make their businesses viable -- investments the catalog companies had made long ago.</p>
        <p>Internet merchants also acknowledged their need for direct marketing expertise -- an admission that might have seemed downright flattering to catalog companies, if they were not too busy trying to keep the dot-coms from luring away their best executives.</p>
        <p>But now that investors have turned their attention to profitability, the old-line catalog companies that have built the most extensive Web operations are stepping into more favorable light. Companies like Lands' End, Hanover Direct and BMG Direct are already generating profits from their e-commerce sites. And, thanks to the Web, the prospects for their catalog businesses are improving.</p>
        <p>''Their numbers are staggering,'' said Barbara Wykoff, an analyst with the investment firm Buckingham Research. ''It's frightening how fast they're growing.''</p>
        <p>Lands' End, for example, generated 3 percent of sales from its Web site (www.landsend.com) in 1998, Ms. Wykoff said. But last quarter, that number was 12 percent. BMG Direct, a Bertelsmann unit that sells CD's, generated 10 percent of its sales from the Web last year, and could reach 15 percent this year.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wykoff said that companies with a catalog pedigree -- including J. C. Penney, Lands' End and L.L. Bean -- not only have some of the most visited e-commerce sites on the Web, but they have proved to be the best at converting browsers to buyers. Those three companies each have conversion rates of 13 to 16 percent online, according to Nielsen/ NetRatings, an Internet research firm, compared with an average of about 1.8 percent among all Web retailers.</p>
        <p>But perhaps the most important statistic separating catalog companies from their Web-only competitors is customer acquisition cost. According to a recent survey by the Boston Consulting Group on behalf of the industry association Shop.org, catalog retailers spent $11 on average for each new customer last year. In comparison, e-tailers spent $82 per customer.</p>
        <p>The reason for such a disparity, of course, is that e-tailers are still burning through tens of millions of dollars in advertising to attract customers to their sites.</p>
        <p>Catalog companies, meanwhile, have a built-in marketing vehicle that can sit around a consumer's house for weeks before it reaches the trash. And to make sure customers remember the Internet sites, catalog companies often print their Web addresses on every page.</p>
        <p>Catalog companies also report that instead of the Web cannibalizing their catalog sales, it is creating new customers.</p>
        <p>Hanover Direct, which owns several catalog operations, including Gump's, International Male and the Company Store, said that 50 percent of its online customers last year had not previously purchased goods from their catalogs.</p>
        <p>''We've found that taking a print catalog and using targeted marketing principles is the most efficient way to create online customers,'' said Rakesh K. Kaul, Hanover's chief executive. ''It's no contest,'' he said, when compared with ''e-tailers who go out and buy ads on the Super Bowl.''</p>
        <p>The Web has also helped build the overall profit the company can squeeze out of each customer over repeat visits, he said. Rather than send an existing customer a new catalog each month, Mr. Kaul said, the company complements the catalog mailings with e-mail messages, thereby reducing marketing costs. ''So the Web now becomes a very efficient way to maintain customer contact,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Catalog businesses benefit from the Web in other ways as well.</p>
        <p>George McMillan, chief executive of BMG Direct, said the company could use the Web to test and create new catalog ideas that might not otherwise be viable.</p>
        <p>''If you can't identify a market of 400,000 to 500,000 users, you can't justify the product development costs and research necessary to test it,'' Mr. McMillan said.</p>
        <p>''With the Web, you don't have any paper or printing costs associated with testing an idea,'' he continued. ''You can try more things without getting burned, and maybe find niches of the market that are smaller, but still make sense economically.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McMillan declined to say if BMG would roll out new catalogs aimed at BMG customers as a result of this testing. But he said the company was ''experimenting with some things'' among BMG's 10 million customers -- 2.8 million of whom are online. ''There are a lot of segments in 10 million people,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Happy as they are with their core businesses, catalog companies recognize that it is far more economical to close a sale over the Web than over the phone, so they are pushing to convert more of their customers to the Web with every passing month. According to Ms. Wykoff of Buckingham Research, catalog companies ''won't save a significant amount of money'' on overall customer costs ''until the Internet gets to 20 percent of their business.''</p>
        <p>There are exceptions. The Bear Creek Corporation, which owns Harry and David, a food catalog and Web site (www.harryanddavid.com), generates about 9 percent of its sales on the Internet, and saves about $4.60 for each order placed through the Web, according to Nancy Tait, the company's executive vice president. Given the orders the company handled on the Web last year, that amounts to about $1.1 million saved.</p>
        <p>But as Lands' End found out last year, companies cannot rely too much on the Web to deliver profits. Lands' End mailed about 9 percent fewer catalogs last holiday season, analysts said -- a move that might help explain its 17 percent dip in holiday sales and a substantial decline in its stock price.</p>
        <p>''There's an inextricable link between the catalog and the site,'' said Bill Bass, vice president of e-commerce for Lands' End. ''Our traffic always spikes when the catalogs arrive.''</p>
        <p>But that will not stop the company from an Internet-only approach in other countries. This summer, Mr. Bass said, Lands' End will roll out sites in several European countries where the company does not mail catalogs. As for marketing in those countries, he said, ''online, word-of-mouth means a lot.''</p>
        <p>For catalog companies, one of the most satisfying aspects of the recent slide in e-tailing stocks is that their own employees are now less inclined to jump ship when a dot-com recruiter calls. ''That's been a real drain on our industry,'' said Ms. Tait of Bear Creek. ''I'm hoping those days are over.''</p>
        <p>They may be. Mr. Kaul of Hanover said that dot-coms were now more interested in forming partnerships  with catalog companies than luring away their employees.</p>
        <p>''We've seen a number of Internet companies approach us recently saying, 'Gee, why don't you create a catalog for us and help us understand how this works?' '' he said. ''So I wouldn't be surprised if you see more and more combinations in the catalog and Internet world.''</p>
