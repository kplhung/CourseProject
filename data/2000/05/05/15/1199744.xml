        <p>Late in the third quarter yesterday, as the game was starting to slip away from the Miami Heat, the team gathered for a 20-second timeout. As Coach Pat Riley stepped onto the court, Tim Hardaway walked in front of him and leaned over, hands on his knees, looking for an answer.</p>
        <p>But there were no answers for Hardaway now. Hobbled by a sprained left foot and a pair of worn 33-year-old knees, he could not keep up. Hardaway had just given up 7 points in six minutes to Charlie Ward, a player whom he could have handled so easily in another time, and a 1-point Miami lead was turning into a landslide against the Heat, the deficit at 8 as Hardaway and his teammates gathered in front of their bench.</p>
        <p>The answer for Riley was to pull Hardaway and insert the rookie Anthony Carter, sitting Hardaway for the remainder of the game as the Heat dropped a 91-83 decision to the Knicks in Game 4 of the Eastern Conference semifinals at Madison Square Garden. As the four-of-seven-game series heads back to Miami, even at two games each, Hardaway is wondering if he is hurt too badly to continue.</p>
        <p>''I'm hurting the team, huh?'' Hardaway said. ''I don't know. We'll see. I'm going to talk to the coach and try to find out, just go from there.''</p>
        <p>Hardaway was a question mark before this series, sitting out Miami's opening-round sweep of the Detroit Pistons. After an eight-day break, he was able to limp onto the floor in Game 1 against the Knicks, but he has not been able to give the Heat anything close to his usual production.</p>
        <p>Asked if the matchup of the point guards would be in Miami's favor if he were healthy, Hardaway said: ''Of course. No doubt about it.'' But now, he acknowledged: ''It's in the other team's favor. That's the way I feel.''</p>
        <p>Riley has never hesitated to stand loyal to his star players, to be willing to lose with them if that had to be the result. Now he faces the decision of whether to continue to place Hardaway on the floor in a situation that his body cannot support. There are few options, though, other than starting Carter, since the Heat does not have another point guard after those two. ''We'll talk,'' Riley said afterward. ''I'll talk to him. I'll sit down with him.''</p>
        <p>For Hardaway, the quick step is gone; he is unable to cut or push off his left foot. He came out in the third quarter of Friday's Game 3 and gave way to Carter, who won the game for Miami with his floater in overtime. But this time there were no heroics from the unheralded rookie, who shot 1 of 5 from the floor and displayed a glaring inability to contain Ward down the stretch.</p>
        <p>Now, in what amounts to a two-of-three-game series with two days off before Game 5, the Heat faces a possibility that Hardaway can no longer force himself to play. ''Obviously, we want Tim healthy, but if he's not healthy, he's not healthy,'' shooting guard Dan Majerle said. ''But we've won without him before. A. C.'s done a great job. Tim's a warrior and we'd love to have him, but we don't put any of this on Tim not being there.''</p>
        <p>Before the game, Hardaway was asked how the foot could get better in 48 hours since Game 3 and he said: ''It didn't. I'm just going to go out and see.'' He started well, handing out five assists in nine minutes in the first quarter, hitting a high-arcing jumper that sent a shiver into the 19,763 Garden fans. It was a reminder of the player who had scored 38 points against the Knicks in a 1997 playoff game and who had sent so many daggers into their hearts when he had a killer crossover and two healthy legs to follow behind it.</p>
        <p>But in the third quarter yesterday, the foot would not allow him any heroics.</p>
        <p>There was little sympathy from the Knicks, who put the ball in Ward's hands and told him to attack, to take advantage of the wounded player, the unlikely weak link. With the Heat leading, 47-46, Hardaway missed a jumper and then Ward drove by him for a layup. Then after a pair of free throws put Miami back in front, Ward drove again, getting past Hardaway and drawing the defense, kicking the ball out to Larry Johnson for an open 3-pointer.</p>
        <p>Hardaway missed another jumper, and then gave the ball up on a steal by Ward. Hardaway lost his dribble again, resulting in a jump ball that he could not even consider winning. On the other end, Ward dropped in another 3-pointer and the 20-second timeout came, ending Hardaway's day. ''I thought he was aggressive on the offensive end, made shots, made things happen for them,'' Hardaway said of Ward's attack. ''He just played a good ballgame, did what any point guard would do: come out and try to get his team going and play hard.''</p>
        <p>Of his own status, Hardaway was less sure. ''We'll see,'' he said. ''All I can say is we'll see. I could've come back, but I think A. C. was out there doing a beautiful job.''</p>
        <p>Of Riley's decision to keep him on the bench, Hardaway said: ''He thought that sitting me out and letting him go run the offense would get the team to another victory. I was over there cheering. I'm doing whatever, whatever it takes.''</p>
