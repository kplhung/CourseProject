        <p>Andre Gregory's production of ''The Designated Mourner,'' the Wallace Shawn play that is receiving its New York premiere in a long-abandoned men's club in Lower Manhattan, is so theatrically indulgent that it dares you to find it pretentious, or maybe just precious.

        <p>Andre Gregory's production of ''The Designated Mourner,'' the Wallace Shawn play that is receiving its New York premiere in a long-abandoned men's club in Lower Manhattan, is so theatrically indulgent that it dares you to find it pretentious, or maybe just precious. It is both, actually, but to provocative and haunting effect.</p>
        <p>The play is about the dissolution of a marriage in the context of a savage, Orwellian society that has no use for the idiosyncratic probing of artists. It is a futuristic horror story about what happens when the instinct to find beauty through creative expression is forcibly squelched and a terrible lament that this is already happening. In Mr. Shawn's argument here, art, in its ambition, is pretentious; in its achievement, it is unutterably precious.</p>
        <p>For the audience, which is limited to 30 people, the performance begins upon entering the staunch brick structure, built in 1929 and unused for decades: its interior in lustrous decrepitude, its stature symbolically dwarfed by surrounding financial towers. You have to ascend four flights of stairs, following a path of yellow lights through a maze of corridors, to arrive at the theater,  an unpainted room with heavy red drapes on one wall, makeshift risers for a motley assortment of chairs, and on the performance floor a roomful of furniture swathed in off-white dropcloths. It's a ghostly setting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gregory, a gentle-mannered man, is likely to greet you on the fourth floor, and to signal the start of the three-character play merely by settling into his own armchair in the front row. After the 90-minute first act he invites the audience for a snack -- fruit, cheese, cookies, hard-boiled eggs -- and then asks everyone to follow him up another flight of stairs for the second act, which is performed in a closed room, empty but for the actors sitting on a couch and, a few feet in front of them, tightly packed wooden chairs for the audience.</p>
        <p>You feel as though you're sealed in a vault, suggestive of the stifling world the characters describe, or maybe the execution chamber whose image chills the play's final minutes.</p>
        <p>The play is over when the last of the actors, Mr. Shawn, who plays the title role, simply stands up and leaves after reciting his final line. No one comes back for applause, but  audience members are asked to join the cast for chitchat back on the floor below.</p>
        <p>In other words, the whole thing is site-specific, not in the sense that the play was created to be performed in a former men's club, but that a suitable place was found for the spirit and text of Mr. Shawn's work. Overall it means to be the kind of art -- difficult, unsettling and out of the mainstream, but with an embracing heart -- that the play itself declares endangered.</p>
        <p>The work consists of three interlocking monologues. The characters, who move about the stage in a dreamy, almost underwaterlike choreography, are Jack, the titular character, whose narrative is catalyzed when he realizes that ''everyone on earth who could read John Donne was now dead.'' Among the last to go, executed by the government, were his estranged wife, Judy (played by Deborah Eisenberg), and her father, Howard (Larry Pine), a poet and intellectual whose life was spared for decades, first because his father was the friend of a former president and later because the ruling powers couldn't understand his work.</p>
        <p>In summary that sounds comical, but the narrative is constructed so that the horrific societal tableau is sketched in subtly mounting detail; the texture of a world where the leaders grow ever younger and less interested in the past, where culture comes under the sovereignty of politics, is evoked without declaration but in the process of storytelling, through a novelistically casual revelation of setting. This makes for a plot that unfolds obliquely, in language that is occasionally ponderous, a bit unnatural for speakers, and it certainly requires an audience to concentrate. But the payoff is the creation of an ominous reality that feels discomfortingly familiar as it proceeds to near-apocalypse.</p>
        <p>The more visceral drama is in the story of Jack and Judy's marriage, which begins in bliss but dissolves as Jack, ''a former student of English literature who went downhill from there,'' as he describes himself, slowly succumbs to the prevailing aesthetic. In a wonderful set piece he describes being alone in a hotel room reading a book of poems, when he is distracted by sexual antics in the room next door.</p>
        <p>He never goes back to the book, turning on the television instead, treating the screen as though he's never heard of such a thing. It's a slippery slope; he eventually yields entirely to sensual pleasures over intellectual ones and, concomitantly, becomes more and more inclined to moral judgments and less and less to sympathetic understanding.</p>
        <p>Judy, torn between her father and her husband, cannot turn away from her lineage, a conflict that sets the stage for her second-act verbal pas de deux with Jack. Seated on opposite ends of the couch -- he smugly satisfied, she distraught -- they trade recollections of the brutal events that follow their separation.</p>
        <p>The key to the lingering power of this production is the seductive performance of Mr. Shawn, whose gnomelike appearance, lisp and earnest delight in self-justification make Jack insidiously ingratiating. Jack is evil, but contrary to cliche, not banally so. He thinks carefully, he's self-probing, he decides to go along with the mob, and he believes he is right to do so. In the play's first incarnation, at the Royal National Theater in London in 1996, Mike Nichols earned plaudits for his performance in the part. But it is hard to imagine a more charming bloodcurdler than Mr. Shawn, even when he is suffering from a nasty cough, as he was last week.</p>
        <p>As playwright, Mr. Shawn has set Jack's appeal in relief against the characters of Judy and Howard, who are just the sort of surface-smug people that live in the public consciousness under the rubric ''intellectual elite.'' The play is a defense of them, and of the compassion that a belief in art and beauty instills in any human being. But in the world of ''The Designated Mourner,'' their beleaguered status emphasizes the closed-seeming nature of their club, and in their threatened circumstances Howard and Judy are hard-pressed to exhibit the kind of vividness that makes Jack such an inviting personage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pine, who appears in the first act mostly in bed in his pajamas and in the second act as only an observer, plays Howard as a nearly defeated man clinging to his dignity and achievement, which Jack perceives as contempt and condescension. As Judy, Ms. Eisenberg (who is Mr. Shawn's life partner and is best known as an accomplished short-story writer) gives a relentless portrayal of emotional distress; the lugubriousness of her performance is trying, but it makes a point.</p>
        <p>In the end they are gone, and you are left in an empty room, silent, wondering what life would be like without the kind of people who would, however modest and however marginalized, make a play like this.</p>
