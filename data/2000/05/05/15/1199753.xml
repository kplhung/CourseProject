        <p>Only a week earlier Kirby Puckett had become baseball's first $3 million-a-year player with a three-year, $9 million contract with Minnesota and now Oakland was about to announce a new contract for Rickey Henderson that would pay him $3 million a year over four years.</p>

        <p>Only a week earlier Kirby Puckett had become baseball's first $3 million-a-year player with a three-year, $9 million contract with Minnesota and now Oakland was about to announce a new contract for Rickey Henderson that would pay him $3 million a year over four years.</p>
        <p>But Henderson was not happy. In November 1989, he wanted to be the highest-paid player, bar none, and he had groused to his agent, Richmond Bry, that he had failed to get him there. They were on their way into a news conference at Oakland Coliseum when an electrician, working in the area, spotted the Athletics star.</p>
        <p>''Hey, Rickey,'' the workman shouted, ''it better be $4 million a year.''</p>
        <p>Turning to Bry, Henderson said, ''See, I told you.''</p>
        <p>With Henderson, it has always been about money. That attitude has made him no different from most players, most people; it's just that Henderson has often reacted more severely to perceived economic slights than most.</p>
        <p>It was his unhappiness with his $2 million salary this year that plunged him into a preseason funk that undermined his performance and fueled his premature departure from the Mets.</p>
        <p>Had Henderson had a .315 batting average and a .423 on-base percentage, the figures he attained last season, the Mets would not have released him in his 22nd year in the major leagues. Had the Mets been winning three out of every five games, they would have given Henderson more time to get back to the leadoff hitter who caused consternation every time he reached base.</p>
        <p>The problem was that he was providing virtually no production (.219 batting average) but creating much consternation for Mets management. His teammates had no problem with Henderson, at 41 years old a senior player always willing to help younger players. But it has always been thus with Rickey.</p>
        <p>Long before the 2000 salary fallout fell into Bobby Valentine's lap, Tony La Russa, with Oakland, and Lou Piniella, with the Yankees, endured the Rickey brand of aggravation.</p>
        <p>The second spring after Henderson signed that $3 million-a-year contract, he boycotted the early days of spring training. In the interim 15 months, dozens of players had signed more lucrative contracts and Henderson wasn't happy.</p>
        <p>''I still don't like the contract,'' he said. ''I never liked the contract from the day I signed it.''</p>
        <p>La Russa acknowledged that the Athletics knew Henderson, by his absence, was making a statement. ''We can appreciate it,'' the manager said on the day Henderson was officially late for spring training. ''But once he makes his statement, he has to be here for the team. At some point, get in camp.''</p>
        <p>In an attempt to lure Henderson to camp, the manager and the players good-humoredly established a ''Rickey Appreciation Fund,'' stuffing a 10-inch-high jar several times over with dollar bills.</p>
        <p>''We're just trying to make the point,'' La Russa said, '' 'You're worth more than $3 million. We know it; we want you.' ''</p>
        <p>Henderson had won the American League Most Valuable Player award the year before, the first year of the contract. But in 1991, the year of his boycott, his production plunged, and he was suspected of not playing hard because he was unhappy with his contract.</p>
        <p>It was a scenario that would be repeated this year.</p>
        <p>''People mix my business with my job,'' Henderson said at that time. ''It's two different things.'' He blamed his below-average season on an injured body, not a disgruntled state of mind.</p>
        <p>''I get hurt, and the press says you're dogging it,'' he said. ''Like I'm supposed to be a robot. If I get hurt and I play, they say, 'Why do you play?' But if I don't play, they don't believe me. They say, 'Why aren't you playing?' How can I win? I can't win.''</p>
        <p>Henderson did not win in 1987, when he was out with a hamstring injury. Neither did the Yankees, who had been in contention, after George Steinbrenner delivered one of the most destructive acts in his ownership of the team.</p>
        <p>Piniella had become impatient waiting for Henderson to return and made some comments privately to other club officials.</p>
        <p>But Piniella himself became embroiled in a dispute with Steinbrenner. The owner retaliated by disclosing Piniella's comments, saying that the manager had called the general manager about Henderson and said: ''He's a dog. I want him out of here. Trade him.''</p>
        <p>Henderson has moved around in his career. He has played for the Athletics four different times and the Yankees, Toronto, San Diego, Anaheim and the Mets once each. Based on his performances with the Padres and the Angels in 1996 and '97 and with the Athletics in '98, he appeared to be closing in on the end of a brilliant career.</p>
        <p>But the Mets, seeking a left fielder and a leadoff hitter, signed him for the 1999 season and added an option for this year. He was a pleasant surprise for them last season, helping fire them into the playoffs. His performance in the series against Arizona was also exceptional.</p>
        <p>But the year ended sourly, when he was accused of playing cards in the clubhouse with Bobby Bonilla in the final innings of the final game with Atlanta. The mood didn't improve in the ensuing months as he complained about the $2 million salary that vested automatically when he reached his 500th plate appearance last season.</p>
        <p>The Mets will formally place him on unconditional-release waivers today. He will clear waivers Wednesday, then pursue a job with another team, perhaps Detroit or Seattle.</p>
        <p>''A change of atmosphere always gives a person new life,'' Henderson once said. ''I'm looking to play even better than I have this year.''</p>
        <p>Rickey has almost always responded positively to change. He will surprise no one if he does it again in the coming weeks.</p>
