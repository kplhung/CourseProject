        <p>Small-business owners are going online in droves looking for deals, particularly on computer equipment, office supplies and travel reservations, according to a survey planned for release today by Access Markets International Partners, a market research firm in New York.</p>
        <p>The trend was so strong that small businesses spent more online last year than consumers did, the survey showed. It said small businesses in the United States spent $25 billion online in 1999, which was up from only $2 billion in 1998 and topped the $20 billion spent by consumers.</p>

        <p>Small-business owners are going online in droves looking for deals, particularly on computer equipment, office supplies and travel reservations, according to a survey planned for release today by Access Markets International Partners, a market research firm in New York.</p>
        <p>The trend was so strong that small businesses spent more online last year than consumers did, the survey showed. It said small businesses in the United States spent $25 billion online in 1999, which was up from only $2 billion in 1998 and topped the $20 billion spent by consumers.</p>
        <p>Small businesses are expected to spend $118 billion online in 2001, according to Andy Bose, president and chief executive of Access Markets, which co-sponsored the survey with Inc. magazine.</p>
        <p>Small business customers have also learned there is strength in numbers: 1.3 million of them are interested in using the Internet to pool their purchasing with their peers to obtain better prices online.</p>
        <p>The findings are good news for Web companies like Demandline.com, based in San Mateo, Calif. Demandline is one of a crop of services that creates buying groups of small business customers, and uses a reverse-auction format to let the customer group name the prices they are willing to pay for goods and services. The survey indicated that small businesses are comfortable with auction sites: nearly one million of them plan to participate in online auctions this year.</p>
        <p>But the survey also had some bad news for e-commerce. While many are comfortable shopping online, 6 of 10 small businesses owners said they they were not interested in selling there and that they were overwhelmed by the technical challenges.</p>
        <p>But then, some 600,000 small businesses have already made the jump to online sales. ''There's a lot of opportunity,'' Mr. Bose said, ''but also a lot of apprehension.''</p>
