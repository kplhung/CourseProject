        <p>Ben Ratliff reviews last night of Jazz at Lincoln Center's Duets on the Hudson series, featuring Steve Lacy and Mal Waldron, and Han Bennink and Misha Mengelberg (M)</p>

        <p>Jazz musicians who considered themselves avant-garde in the 1960's were often attracted to extremes of temperament. On May 7 at the Kaplan Penthouse at Lincoln Center, a double bill of duets featuring figures from that generation proved that even in their autumn years, they are still interested in extremes: Steve Lacy and Mal Waldron drawn to the low, phlegmatic end, Han Bennink and Misha Mengelberg to the excitable, unstable end.</p>
        <p>The concert was the last night of Jazz at Lincoln Center's ''Duets on the Hudson'' series. Both sets of partners have played with each other for 30 to 40 years, and both performances were predictable. Thelonious Monk is a guiding influence for both Mr. Lacy, the soprano saxophonist, and Mr. Waldron, the pianist, and they played a familiar-sounding set: Monk's ''Let's Call This'' and ''Epistrophe'' and pieces by Bud Powell, Herbie Nichols and one original each.</p>

        <p>Jazz musicians who considered themselves avant-garde in the 1960's were often attracted to extremes of temperament. On May 7 at the Kaplan Penthouse at Lincoln Center, a double bill of duets featuring figures from that generation proved that even in their autumn years, they are still interested in extremes: Steve Lacy and Mal Waldron drawn to the low, phlegmatic end, Han Bennink and Misha Mengelberg to the excitable, unstable end.</p>
        <p>The concert was the last night of Jazz at Lincoln Center's ''Duets on the Hudson'' series. Both sets of partners have played with each other for 30 to 40 years, and both performances were predictable. Thelonious Monk is a guiding influence for both Mr. Lacy, the soprano saxophonist, and Mr. Waldron, the pianist, and they played a familiar-sounding set: Monk's ''Let's Call This'' and ''Epistrophe'' and pieces by Bud Powell, Herbie Nichols and one original each.</p>
        <p>Mr. Waldron's style is thick and lethargic, with few dynamics; at times he suggests a pre-jazz parlor pianist who has received advance notice about bebop harmonies and Monk's use of repetition. Mr. Lacy's is light and melodic; similarly behind the beat, he relaxes into long tones and he feels best in leisurely tempos. But these readings were all too alike; the music became plodding and joyless, and it took both musicians until the end of the set to warm up.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bennink, the gangly, hyperactive drummer, and Mr. Mengelberg, the hunched and gnomelike pianist, have been partners on Amsterdam's jazz scene since the late 1950's. Despite broad, impressive musicianship, they are now a wild shock-comedy team as much as anything else; if their short set was starved of sustaining musical interaction, it was at least a tailgate party after the first half's funeral procession.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bennink first hurled a sheaf of programs at the audience, then started a driving rhythm on his tom-toms, an athletic, showy, audience-warmer. After a minute he came to a clattering stop, got up, kicked a cymbal with his foot, waved a plastic bag in the air and hit a cymbal with a broom. Meanwhile, under the chaos, Mr. Mengelberg played straight man, softly wading through a rubato version of ''I've Told Every Little Star.'' Mr. Bennink picked it up, playing a lone snare drum, putting fills like machine-gun fire into the sweet song. He bounced drumsticks off the floor, making them jump like fish; he snapped a drumstick over his knee and held an L-shaped stick aloft. Mr. Mengelberg hesitated through it all, stopping and starting a stream of fairly generic jazz-piano playing at cocktail-bar volume.</p>
        <p>All this lunacy amounted to a goof on the protocol of performance, on the range of acceptable gestures for a jazz audience, what constitutes a violation of the expected. Fair enough, but as chaos goes, it was a bit canned. Mr. Bennink in particular has played in New York many times,  so a lot of these routines (the bouncing sticks, playing the floor and walls, moving the snare drum out front) were looking pretty shopworn. Would that he and his partner had played some music, too.</p>
