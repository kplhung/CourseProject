        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Serious Crimes Fall for 8th Consecutive Year'' (news article, May 8):</p>
        <p>Attributing crime reduction to ''get tough'' policing and mandatory sentencing policies, minor gun control legislation and baby boomers aging past their crime-prone years ignores one very important determinant of crime in the United States: improvements in economic opportunity.</p>
        <p>Crime rates are very much a function of labor market opportunities, especially for minorities and low-wage workers. The tight labor market that has prevailed since the mid-1990's is an important reason for the steep fall in crime. Punitive factors have contributed, but so has the increase in low-wage earnings and employment.</p>
        <p>Creating good, paying jobs is one of the best deterrents to crime that money can buy.</p>
        <p>ELLEN  HOUSTON  Washington, May 10, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute.</p>
