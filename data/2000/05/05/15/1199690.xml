        <p>In the prestigious Cavendish Pairs played in Las Vegas over the weekend, Steve Weinstein and Bob Levin were attempting to defend the title they won a year ago. Rather confusingly, with one of the five sessions remaining to be played yesterday, the official standings showed that Weinstein was leading, but Levin was not.</p>
        <p>But that was a different Weinstein, Howard Weinstein, playing Steve Garner, who appeared headed for victory, with a score of 3,721 imps. Their nearest rivals were Eric Rodwell and Marty Fleisher, with 3,233, and David Berkowitz and Larry Cohen with 2,604. In fourth place were the French partners Michel Abecassis and Jean-Christophe Quantinand, with 2,313. Steve Weinstein and Levin were 14th, with 868.</p>

        <p>But that was a different Weinstein, Howard Weinstein, playing Steve Garner, who appeared headed for victory, with a score of 3,721 imps.

        <p>Abecassis and Quantin gained heavily on the diagramed deal. Their shaky four-spade contract was rather better than it might appear, because East's overcall suggested that he would own the spade king and the heart ace.</p>
        <p>Abecassis, South, won the club lead with dummy's ace in order to take an immediate trump finesse. Three rounds disposed of his problems in that department, and he led a diamond to the king. East won with the ace, and would have done best to continue clubs. Instead he led the heart nine, challenging South in that suit.</p>
        <p>It was not likely that East would lead away from the heart queen, so Abecassis guessed right by putting up the king. He exited with a heart, and after winning the ace, East played clubs. South ruffed, cashed one trump winner and reached this ending:</p>
        <p>(Diagram)</p>
        <p>It was clear that West held the heart queen. So when South led the last trump, he knew what to do when West gave up a diamond. He led to the diamond queen in full confidence that the jack would fall. It did, and the Frenchmen had scored an improbable game.</p>
