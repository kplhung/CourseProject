        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Defend Your Identity,'' by William Safire (column, May 11):</p>
        <p>When I was living in Brooklyn, I was pressured to reveal my Social Security number in an unexpected context: jury duty. I didn't think this information was necessary; prospective jurors are drawn from voter rolls, so it's clear that I'm a citizen.</p>
        <p>What a ruckus ensued! I was summoned to an office, but none of the clerks could tell me why this information was relevant. Finally, a clerk threatened that if I didn't fill in my Social Security number, I would not get the daily payment if selected for a jury. I shocked them by waiving any pay. Only then was I was allowed to return to the waiting room.</p>
        <p>The clerks, like so many bureaucrats, had come to assume that they were entitled to this information as a matter of course. Is the reflex to give over one's Social Security number so ingrained that no one before me had ever questioned the relevancy?</p>
