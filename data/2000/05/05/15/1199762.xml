        <p>There was a balmy breeze by the paddle boat lake yesterday afternoon, but the bad news hit the fans of Dave Ippolito, a k a That Guitar Man from Central Park, like a faceful of sleet. After eight summers of strumming his amplified acoustic guitar and singing to crowds of 200 or 300 at a time, Mr. Ippolito has been ordered by the city to unplug his speakers and give it a rest.</p>
        <p>''It's enough to make me cry,'' said Dennis Riley, a school custodian, who said he had been coming to the grassy hill to hear Mr. Ippolito  for years.

        <p>There was a balmy breeze by the paddle boat lake yesterday afternoon, but the bad news hit the fans of Dave Ippolito, a k a That Guitar Man from Central Park, like a faceful of sleet. After eight summers of strumming his amplified acoustic guitar and singing to crowds of 200 or 300 at a time, Mr. Ippolito has been ordered by the city to unplug his speakers and give it a rest.</p>
        <p>''It's enough to make me cry,'' said Dennis Riley, a school custodian, who said he had been coming to the grassy hill to hear Mr. Ippolito  for years. ''There's a lot of stressed-out people in this city and it's nice for us to come,'' said Mr. Riley, who, like the rest of the audience, sings along. ''They're killing a good thing.''</p>
        <p>Martin Anderson, a clerical worker from Inwood who has come to the concerts nearly every weekend for three years, said: ''I come by feeling lousy and leave feeling great. Without Dave, I'm going to have to pay for a therapist.''</p>
        <p>Since 1992, when Mr. Ippolito, 43, the son of a New York firefighter, first took his guitar and microphone to Hernshead hill, near the West 70's,  he has gathered a following.</p>
        <p>People come with blankets and sandwiches and spend hours, weekend after weekend, year after year, singing along to John Denver and James Taylor songs. They slip him personal notes: ''Thank you for making things seem like 'everything is goin' to be all right,' '' said one, typical of the thousands he has collected. They drop dollars in his open guitar case and buy his CD's displayed on the grass.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ippolito said he makes about $1,000 over a weekend, playing five to six hours a day on Saturdays and Sundays. ''I make my living this way,'' he said. ''But it's not about the money. It's a beautiful thing -- that's what it's about. That's something the Henry Sterns of the world will never understand,'' he added, referring to the parks commissioner.</p>
        <p>City regulations prohibit amplified music in parks without a permit. Mr. Stern said residents along Central Park West had complained that they could not go to the park on summer weekends without hearing the guitar concerts.</p>
        <p>''He wants to be there all the time,  selling his records,'' said Mr. Stern, who called Mr. Ippolito's singing ''very pleasant.'' But, he said, ''The park is not a place for permanent private performances by particular people. He could play in the band shell, but he doesn't want to. One guy can't play all the time, in a prime spot, amplify the sound and collect money.''</p>
        <p>Parks officials have offered Mr. Ippolito permission to play one Sunday afternoon every two weeks, and without amplification. But Mr. Ippolito said his singing and acoustic guitar are barely audible without a microphone and speakers.</p>
        <p>Other amplified music can be heard throughout the park when warm weather hits, from jazz groups to roller-skaters' boom-boxes, Mr. Ippolito argued. Doug Blonskey, the administrator of Central Park, acknowledged that, but he said that the skaters used an area set aside for them, and were not displacing others  -- and that the city was cracking down on others who play unauthorized, amplified music.</p>
        <p>''It's nice music, a nice crowd,'' said Mr. Blonskey. ''But sometimes you want to veg out and meditate and read your newspaper and not hear any music. We've got 20 million visitors. He's got to share.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ippolito said he would not fight City Hall. ''If they don't want me, I'm out of here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But his concerts have taken on a life of their own. Fans expect them every weekend, and attend for one another as much as for him, he said.</p>
        <p>Laura Cristofalo, a dietitian from Bay Ridge, who first heard Mr. Ippolito in 1992, when his audience was less than 20 people, said: ''This really disrupts my life. This is very important to me. It relieves the stress of living in New York.''</p>
        <p>Sid Bernstein, a fan of Mr. Ippolito's and the music producer who arranged the Beatles' concerts in Shea Stadium in 1965 and 1966, said: ''This is so sad. Dave is terrifically talented. He's entertaining. It's the beauty. It's the truth. It's New York at its best.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Ippolito sat on the grass and sang John Denver's ''Take Me Home, Country Roads'' without a microphone. His fans leaned forward, apparently straining to hear him.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to trash the Parks Department,'' he said during a break. ''I don't do angry. We don't do angry here.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, several fans said they were planning to fight for the return of the Guitar Man's summer concerts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Riley, sitting on his blanket and looking glum, said: ''People say the city is rude and callous and dirty and cold. Well, this is the opposite. And they're taking it away from us.''</p>
