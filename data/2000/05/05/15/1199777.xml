        <p>''When sorrows come, they come not single spies, but in battalions.''</p>
        <p>For Rudy Giuliani, Shakespeare's prediction came true with the news of his prostate cancer; that, in a way, triggered the exposure of a current extramarital relationship. That was followed by his public announcement of separation plans, which was news to his actress-wife, who then lashed back with a charge of a previous relationship with his former press agent.</p>
        <p>Because of the cancer's danger to his life, partisan glee at the latest revelations is muted. But it will grow as those who stuck with the Clintons say: ''See? Everybody does it. Now let's hear you Bible-thumping moralizers excoriate the Republican mayor the way you dumped on the Democratic president.''</p>
        <p>Take it from a Nixon hand: the ''everybody did it'' excuse didn't fly a generation ago on power abuse and won't fly now on this. In Giuliani's travails is no score-settling for Clinton's trials.</p>
        <p>That's because political anger at Clinton was directed at his serial obstructions, harassments and lies, which amounted to wrongdoing on a grand scale -- and not at his fidelity shortfalls, an ever-more-common failing in which he is joined by the majority of American adults. Nobody has yet accused Giuliani of harassing a female co-worker or lying under oath.</p>
        <p>But what of the saying, ''People who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones''? Liberal friends demand: How can you conservative stiffs rail about family values when some of your own leaders, piously proclaiming their moral superiority, are fooling around like modern Elmer Gantrys?</p>
        <p>Not all moralists are immoral, not all libertarians are libertines and not all right-wingers are stiffs. The entrapment and destruction of Democratic presidential candidate Gary Hart was repeatedly denounced in this space; so was the unconscionable rummaging through Bob Packwood's personal diaries by a nosy Nevada senator who, as retirement nears, has now discovered the need for privacy.</p>
        <p>In that regard, many of us -- even some scandalmongers -- draw a line between private life and public conduct. I'm for full disclosure of financial dealings past and present, but what candidates do in their bedrooms is none of our business, and I really don't care if Al Gore or George W. Bush smoked pot or worse in their youth. Both Giuliani and his former flack deny his wife's charge of an affair; in the absence of evidence, we should presume innocence.</p>
        <p>Ideological opportunists will ask: Doesn't the acrimonious collapse of the Mayor's marriage cast a shadow over his protests at religious defamation by the sensation-seeking Brooklyn museum, his knee-jerk defense of police accused of brutality and his denial of a livelihood to menacing squeegee men?</p>
        <p>It should not, but those politically afflicted are conflicted. Now Republicans know how ardent feminists felt when they saw their sister, Kathleen Willey, accuse Clinton of harassment on ''60 Minutes.'' Surely Rudy, through hubris or humanity, let down the traditionalist side.</p>
        <p>But life happens. People fall in and out of love, or in love with more than one; vows broken can often be re-set and recriminations withdrawn, or separated parents find ways to make peace for the sake of children. The voters, as often as not, forgive (though liberals are more likely to forgive liberals than conservatives are to forgive conservatives).</p>
        <p>Mayor Giuliani is not under sentence of death from God, nor political pariah-hood from the voters of New York. Prostate cancer, discovered early, is treatable; most males so diagnosed die in old age with it rather than from it. He and we can assume he will live to run again another day.</p>
        <p>But not this day and not for this office. He should stop bewailing his outcast fate and get out of the way of defeating Hillary. That torch should be picked up by Gov. George Pataki; if he lacks the guts, Representatives Peter King and Rick Lazio stand ready.</p>
        <p>To be of help to one of them, Giuliani should withdraw today, not next week, and declare his expectation to take his treatment and soon serve healthily as mayor. No hair shirt or pained public introspection necessary. Let Rudy return to being Rudy, with the sharp corners knocked off by life's blows, and set his sights on the governor's mansion two years from now.</p>
