        <p>Thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza poured into the streets today for angry protests, some of which were marked by violent confrontations with Israeli troops that recalled scenes from the intifada, or uprising, of the late 1980's.</p>

        <p>Thousands of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza poured into the streets today for angry protests, some of which were marked by violent confrontations with Israeli troops that recalled scenes from the intifada, or uprising, of the late 1980's.</p>
        <p>The Israelis soldiers used rubber-coated bullets and, according to witnesses, some live ammunition, and the Palestinians hurled stones and firebombs. In the northern west bank town of Qalqilya, one Palestinian man was killed by a rubber bullet to the chest.</p>
        <p>Some of the demonstrators were calling for Israel to release Palestinian prisoners, while in a military prison in Megiddo in northern Israel, the prisoners themselves rioted, burning the tents in which they are kept as Israeli guards used tear gas and rubber bullets to control them.</p>
        <p>Other demonstrators appealed as much to Palestinian as to Israeli leaders, like the refugees who, firing their weapons into the air, marched through Ramallah to demand that the refugee issue not be shunted aside in the peace negotiations.</p>
        <p>It was the start of a second volatile week on the Palestinian street as Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader, tolerated -- some say encouraged -- an outpouring of pent-up frustration. Frustrated himself by a lack of progress at the peace table, Mr. Arafat stepped back and let young Palestinians send their unsettling message to Israelis. ''I haven't seen him so gloomy for some time,'' said Uri Savir, an Israeli lawmaker and former peace negotiator.</p>
        <p>In response, Israeli right-wing leaders seized on the televised images of stone-throwing, masked and armed Palestinians -- images, like those of the Israeli soldiers firing into the crowds, that have been little seen since Prime Minister Ehud Barak was elected a year ago on a peacemaking platform.</p>
        <p>The right-wing leaders called for the peace negotiations to be suspended until Mr. Arafat called off what they called a new intifada.</p>
        <p>The negotiations themselves were overtaken by the activity in the street.</p>
        <p>Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian negotiator, said Mr. Arafat had instructed him to discuss only the immediate demand that 230 prisoners be released. And Oded Eran, the senior Israeli negotiator, asked that the rioting be quelled so the talks could be held in an atmosphere of calm.</p>
        <p>Unrelated to the talks, or so it was said, the Israelis did release one longtime prisoner today, Salah Shihadah, the first commander of the military wing of Hamas, the Islamic fundamentalist group. The Israeli Army declined to renew his detention. He had been held for two years without charges after serving a 10-year sentence.</p>
        <p>Later, Israeli television and radio reported that the Palestinian Authority had captured and imprisoned a leader of Hamas's military wing, Muhammad Deif, though Palestinian officials denied the report. Mr. Deif  is one of Israel's most wanted fugitives and is held responsible for suicide bomb attacks in 1996.</p>
        <p>Peace negotiations have progressed at a snail's pace despite an ambitious deadline of Sept. 13, by which the entire Israeli-Palestinian conflict is supposed to be resolved. Official negotiations, which are being mediated by American peace envoys due to return later this week, are also being abetted by back-channel negotiations and by direct meetings between Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat.</p>
        <p>But the two leaders face domestic political troubles, and Mr. Barak, in particular, appears to be hamstrung by political weakness -- although appearances can be deceiving and crises here can look like just so much noise in retrospect.</p>
        <p>The current round of problems started when Mr. Barak turned his attention back to the Palestinian peace track after acknowledging that talks with Syria seemed to be dead.</p>
        <p>According to associates, Mr. Arafat reset his sights during the period that Mr. Barak was focused on Syria. He decided to try to obtain as much land as possible from the Israelis, in the eventuality that he would have to declare a Palestinian state unilaterally, as he has promised to do if the talks do not show progress by September.</p>
        <p>''Land, land, land,'' said Azmi Bishara, an Israeli-Arab lawmaker who met with Mr. Arafat last week. ''That's all that is on his mind.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Barak shifted his focus back to the Palestinians, his opening gambit was to leak to the Israeli media that he intended to give the Palestinians full control of three Arab villages near Jerusalem. The villages would be a ''down payment'' on the next transfer of West Bank land, and they would be advanced in an effort to warm the negotiating climate, Mr. Barak said.</p>
        <p>The very public nature of the gambit appears to have been a miscalculation.</p>
        <p>First, the Palestinians, miffed that they learned the news through the Israeli media, expressed no jubilation for the three dusty villages, which are already run by the Palestinian civil authorities. And they would not be fooled, they said, into proclaiming the village of Abu Dis to be East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians hope to make their eventual capital.</p>
        <p>Second, the religious parties in Mr. Barak's government, most significantly Shas, balked. Shas's 17 members of Parliament swung their legs over the fence and sat there, as the rabbis that determine the ultra-Orthodox party's policies disappeared into a very long deliberation.</p>
        <p>To assist their deliberation, Mr. Barak seems to be prepared to bail out the party's indebted religious school system. The Americans too are working on securing the party's cooperation, as the ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk, and the peace envoy, Dennis Ross, paid a visit last week to Shas's leader, Eli Yishai.</p>
        <p>But Shas's hesitation created an embarrassment for Mr. Barak, who was forced to announce that he would delay -- perhaps for months -- turning over the villages.</p>
        <p>Palestinian officials, once they learned that they would not be getting the villages that they were not so excited to be getting in the first place, expressed outrage. Mr. Arafat, associates said, could not understand why Mr. Barak was making his every step so public. If he really wanted to turn over the villages, he should have done so quietly and definitively, they said.</p>
        <p>The week ahead, as the Israeli Parliament moves into its summer session, may see a political showdown over this issue. Various political parties are making threats to bolt the government if the villages are transferred or if Shas receives money for its votes. On Monday night, the West Bank settlers are holding their first anti-government rally since Mr. Barak took office.</p>
        <p>The result is that Mr. Barak suddenly faces the very real danger of finding himself the leader of a minority government.</p>
        <p>But as he contemplates his next move, the Prime Minister cannot help but notice that poll after poll shows that the majority of Israelis support making peace with the Palestinians, concessions and all.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak could well decide that his broad-based coalition is not that representative after all and, analysts say, risk a national referendum on peace, calculating that he could retain popular backing with the assistance of the Israeli-Arab parties that are technically in the opposition. He may even be tempted to reconstitute his government.</p>
        <p>Even if it forced his government into new elections, however, a peace deal would undoubtedly bolster Mr. Barak greatly. But is a peace deal possible? On the face of it, the two sides seem to be on opposite sides of a gaping chasm on every issue.</p>
        <p>It is hard to know whether Mr. Barak will -- or can -- modulate any of his positions. It is also hard to know precisely what Mr. Arafat is prepared to swallow.</p>
        <p>The most pessimistic say they foresee a breakdown in peace talks, an explosion on the Palestinian street, and the unilateral declaration of an incomplete Palestinian state amid chaos and violence.</p>
        <p>The most optimistic say that Mr. Barak will prevail at the peace table because the time is finally ripe, and that he will prevail politically, even if he is forced to call new elections.</p>
        <p>In between, many others envision a partial peace deal by the end of the year that leaves aside the thorniest issue, Jerusalem's status, for a future deliberation between two countries, Israel and a new Palestinian state.</p>
