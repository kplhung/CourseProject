        <p>Rashard Casey, the quarterback for Penn State University, and a friend were arrested early yesterday in Hoboken, N.J., and charged with knocking an off-duty police officer unconscious outside a bar, Hoboken Police Chief Carmen LaBruno said.</p>
        <p>Casey, 22, of Hoboken and Desmond Miller, 22, of Jersey City are charged with aggravated assault. The officer, Patrick Fitzsimmons, was treated for facial injuries at a hospital and released.</p>
        <p>The police said Fitzsimmons was attacked as he and a female companion arrived at River Street, a bar, at about 2:45 a.m. The police are treating the attack as a bias incident, LaBruno said, because they believe Casey and Miller resented that Fitzsimmons, who is white, was with a black woman. Casey and Miller are black.</p>
        <p>Casey and Miller were held at the Hudson County Jail in Kearny -- Miller on $20,000 bail, Casey on $5,000 bail. They were expected to be arraigned today.</p>
        <p>''Obviously we're concerned about it, and we're aware of it,'' said Jeff Nelson, Penn State's sports information director. ''I think that at this point, from our standpoint, it would be really inappropriat to comment until we have additional facts about what happened.''</p>
