        <p>In the struggle over how to strengthen Medicare, elderly people seeking prescription drug benefits have suddenly found themselves competing against hospitals, nursing homes and other health care providers that want Congress to increase payments to them.</p>
        <p>The providers have begun an all-out lobbying campaign to persuade Congress to restore money cut from their Medicare payments in 1997. But lawmakers say that if they provided more money to hospitals, nursing homes and home care agencies, there would be less money for outpatient drug benefits for the elderly.</p>
        <p>''It's a zero-sum game,'' said Representative Pete Stark of California, the senior Democrat on the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health. ''The money all has to come out of the same pot.''</p>
        <p>The budget blueprint approved by Congress last month sets aside up to $40 billion over five years for drug benefits and other changes in Medicare, but does not say precisely how the money is to be used.</p>
        <p>If Congress cannot agree on drug benefits this year -- and agreement is by no means certain -- health care providers hope to scoop up money that would otherwise be used for that purpose.</p>
        <p>Tensions between beneficiaries and providers, dimly perceived as a possibility last year, have become more evident in recent weeks.</p>
        <p>''It's a very real conflict,'' said Tricia Smith, chief federal health lobbyist at the AARP, the nation's largest organization of older Americans, which was formerly known as the American Association of Retired Persons.</p>
        <p>''Congress is seriously considering giving more money back to providers,'' Ms. Smith said, ''but still hasn't given one penny to prescription drugs for Medicare beneficiaries. That's a serious problem.''</p>
        <p>Lauren M. Maddox, a political strategist at podesta.com, a Washington lobbying firm, said: ''Health care providers who feel they were wronged by the Balanced Budget Act in 1997 are all going after this pot of money. They hope that the money will become available to them if Medicare prescription drug legislation is stalled because of philosophical disagreements between Republicans and Democrats.''</p>
        <p>When Congress passed the Balanced Budget Act in 1997, the law trimmed Medicare reimbursements to almost every kind of health care provider.</p>
        <p>The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the measure would reduce projected Medicare spending by $112 billion, or 8 percent, over the next five years. But it now appears that the savings will exceed twice that amount, and many health care providers say they have been devastated by the cuts.</p>
        <p>Congress restored $16 billion last year, but the providers say that just whetted their appetite for more relief, and they have mobilized a small army of lobbyists to plead their case.</p>
        <p>Frederick H. Graefe, a health care lobbyist, summarized the providers' outlook this way: ''Most observers believe that if a Medicare drug benefit is enacted this year, it would soak up all the $40 billion, so there wouldn't be anything left for providers. Most observers also believe that a drug benefit won't be enacted this year, despite the good intentions of both parties. There will be a stalemate.''</p>
        <p>Then, Mr. Graefe said, up to half the $40 billion could become available to providers in September.</p>
        <p>Thomas A. Scully, president of the Federation of American Health Systems, which represents nearly 1,700 for-profit hospitals, said: ''It's a choice between helping doctors, hospitals and nursing homes -- or seniors. And seniors vote, so drug benefits have a higher political priority. We are worried.''</p>
        <p>Linda Keegan, a spokeswoman for the American Health Care Association, which represents 12,000 nursing homes, said: ''It's so attractive to offer new prescription drug benefits. But if Congress does that, it may be at the cost of existing benefits. You have to do first things first -- take care of existing benefits before you start adding new ones.''</p>
        <p>Some members of Congress say the struggle pits the needs of beneficiaries against the greed of providers. But providers reject that analysis. They say their interests coincide with those of Medicare beneficiaries because the quality of care suffers when providers receive inadequate payments.</p>
        <p>Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, asked, ''Are we going to pay for drug benefits by taking it out of the hide of current Medicare providers, who are already on the ropes?''</p>
        <p>Drug spending is increasing 15 percent to 20 percent a year even in well-run private health plans. If the cost of Medicare drug benefits rose at anything like that rate, Congress would almost certainly feel pressure to curb payments to doctors, hospitals and nursing homes.</p>
        <p>Dr. Thomas R. Reardon, president of the American Medical Association, said: ''We support the concept of pharmaceutical benefits for senior citizens, but what happens if the budget surplus isn't there in five or 10 years? The fear is always that Congress will cut reimbursement for doctors and hospitals.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stark said, ''Hospital lobbying is the most intense I've witnessed in a long time.''</p>
        <p>Eight hospital organizations meet twice a week at the Washington headquarters of the American Hospital Association to coordinate their efforts. Around the table are lobbyists for teaching hospitals, Roman Catholic hospitals, children's hospitals, public hospitals and investor-owned hospitals.</p>
        <p>Most of these groups have their own advisers and legislative consultants to help them polish their arguments and open doors on Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>In the last year, for example, the American Hospital Association paid $220,000 to Policy Impact Communications and Edward Gillespie, a lobbyist who used to work for the House Republican leadership; $180,000 to Bergner-Bockorny Inc.; $80,000 to O'Neill, Athy &amp; Casey, a firm that includes a son of Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., the former House speaker, and $80,000 to the Legislative Strategies Group.</p>
        <p>The Federation of American Health Systems, which represents investor-owned hospitals, paid $120,000 to Fierce &amp; Isakowitz, $180,000 to Baker &amp; Hostetler and $80,000 to Health Policy Alternatives.</p>
        <p>The tone of the lobbyists is one of alarm bordering on desperation. The 1997 budget cuts have caused ''real pain for real people,'' the American Hospital Association said. ''Nearly 35 percent of the nation's hospitals are operating in the red,'' it said, because the costs of labor, drugs, blood and new technology are rising faster than Medicare reimbursement.</p>
        <p>On May 1, Ernst &amp; Young, the accounting firm, and HCIA-Sachs, a health care information organization, issued a report saying, ''The Balanced Budget Act created the greatest financial instability that hospitals have experienced since the creation of Medicare in 1965.''</p>
        <p>The Federation of American Health Systems trumpeted the findings as confirmation of its concerns. ''May Day, May Day!'' it said in a statement issued by Mr. Scully, its president. ''America's hospitals have been pushed to the brink by the Balanced Budget Act.''</p>
        <p>The American Health Care Association says inadequate Medicare payment rates have created a ''national crisis'' for nursing homes. Bruce Yarwood, legislative counsel for the association, says 1,660 nursing homes, or 1 in 10 nationwide, have been forced into bankruptcy.</p>
        <p>No sector of the health care industry has been more assiduous or effective in lobbying Congress than health maintenance organizations. In asking Congress for more money, they make two main arguments. First, they say H.M.O.'s have been leaving Medicare or curtailing their participation because they consider payments inadequate. Second, they say many H.M.O.'s have cut back drug coverage for Medicare beneficiaries because federal payments leave no room for such optional benefits.</p>
        <p>Lobbyists for the health care industry are hoping the Congressional Budget Office will increase its forecast of the budget surplus, so more money will be available for Medicare initiatives.</p>
