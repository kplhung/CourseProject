        <p>Assigning Worth to Genes  Genetic testing is becoming more common, and, for almost every gene, some medical institution or some company owns a patent on its use. But patients whose cells provided the genes that have been patented are almost never compensated. Now, some patients have become wary about providing their tissue for genetic research. A few have demanded money up front before providing tissue. Others are writing contracts spelling out what they are entitled to if they help scientists find genes.</p>
