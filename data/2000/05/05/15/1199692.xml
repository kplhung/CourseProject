        <p>A special task force helping the Federal Trade Commission study Internet privacy practices has been unable to reach a consensus on whether and how Web sites should be required to give consumers access to the personal data compiled on them.</p>
        <p>The task force's report, finished last Friday by a 42-member panel of business, privacy and technical experts, cites the complex security and access issues that policy makers must consider in deciding whether to regulate the way companies amass huge databases of consumer information. Among the questions the report raises is whether the costs of access -- measured by money, convenience or privacy risks -- would be too high, for businesses and consumers alike.</p>

        <p>A special task force helping the Federal Trade Commission study Internet privacy practices has been unable to reach a consensus on whether and how Web sites should be required to give consumers access to the personal data compiled on them.</p>
        <p>The task force's report, finished last Friday by a 42-member panel of business, privacy and technical experts, cites the complex security and access issues that policy makers must consider in deciding whether to regulate the way companies amass huge databases of consumer information. Among the questions the report raises is whether the costs of access -- measured by money, convenience or privacy risks -- would be too high, for businesses and consumers alike.</p>
        <p>The report provides a sophisticated discussion of the issues, but it does not give the F.T.C. any clear guidance for a report the commission is to give Congress on Internet privacy later this month. In that report, the F.T.C. will indicate whether it intends to seek legislation that would spell out basic privacy practices that Internet companies must follow when collecting personal data.</p>
        <p>Part of that report will be based on a recent F.T.C. survey of the privacy practices of major Web sites. Details of that study are being closely guarded, but it is expected to show that most major Web sites have posted privacy policies telling visitors what types of personal information they collect and how it is used -- but that few of those sites meet what the F.T.C. considers to be adequate basic privacy guidelines.</p>
        <p>Privacy-rights advocates say the F.T.C. has little choice but to seek legislation. But opponents of such a move may cite the task force report in arguing that the issues are too complex to legislate.</p>
