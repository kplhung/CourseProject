        <p>Every time Mike Hampton rocked his body toward home plate late in yesterday's game, the Florida Marlins hitter at bat saw a thick dirt stain on the pitcher's right pants leg. It was a battle scar, proof that Hampton had been rolling around and doing the things he most likes to do on a field.</p>
        <p>Hampton, who pitched a complete-game 5-1 victory for the Mets yesterday at Shea Stadium, has said he would have probably been an everyday player if he were not left-handed. Or maybe he would have taken the combined football and baseball scholarship Florida State offered him and made it as a defensive back.</p>
        <p>Hampton said he felt like a football player in the sixth inning, on the play that dirtied his pinstripes. With Hampton on first, Joe McEwing doubled into the left-field corner for his second extra-base hit this weekend, doubling the season total of the departed leadoff man Rickey Henderson. Hampton sprinted for third, got the signal to score, then nearly lost his balance as he rounded third base.</p>
        <p>''You feel like the guy running down the football field, and he looks like he's running too fast for his body -- he falls down at about the 2,'' Hampton said. ''I saw that flashing in front of my eyes.''</p>
        <p>He should not have worried. Hampton slid safely into home, then watched as two walks (including an intentional fourth ball to Edgardo Alfonzo) brought up Mike Piazza with the bases loaded. Piazza's swing was not graceful, he admitted, but it was enough to drive a Brad Penny fastball over the right-field fence for a grand slam.</p>
        <p>''I saw him hit that darned thing with his back foot off the ground,'' Marlins Manager John Boles said. ''He one-footed that thing. I thought I was watching Roberto Clemente in his heyday.''</p>
        <p>Hampton pitched like another player looked in his heyday -- himself. After struggling in his first seven starts, Hampton, who shut out Pittsburgh for eight and a third innings last week, is no longer competing against himself, Manager Bobby Valentine said.</p>
        <p>Valentine has not seen Hampton examining the baseball or walking around the mound lately. Hampton is simply getting on the mound and throwing the ball where he wants to. He still leads the majors in walks, but he issued none yesterday. He allowed eight hits and struck out five.</p>
        <p>Hampton began to relax after his last poor start, in San Francisco on May 3. He told himself to trust his stuff, tune out the endless mechanical advice and just pitch. Leaving the ballpark alone that night to walk back to the team hotel -- a 25-minute walk interrupted by two movies he stopped to see -- gave him a chance to put his troubles in perspective.</p>
        <p>''I just got it in my head that this is a game,'' Hampton said. ''There's a lot of stuff going on in the world that's a lot tougher than what I'm going through.''</p>
        <p>He faced a tough situation in the first inning yesterday, allowing singles on three of his first four pitches to load the bases. Preston Wilson --  7 for 16 with 13 runs batted in in his last four games against the Mets -- came up, and Hampton just wanted a double-play ball. But he did better, striking out Wilson on a slider and getting a double-play ball from the next hitter, Derrek Lee.</p>
        <p>From the second through the seventh innings, the Marlins managed only an infield single.</p>
        <p>But sometimes those can do damage, too. Hampton got one in the sixth, when he noticed Marlins third baseman Kevin Millar playing back. Hampton took a pitch, saw that Millar was still back, then bunted for a single.</p>
        <p>''He took it upon himself to try to jump-start us,'' Piazza said, ''and he did that.''</p>
        <p>A .311 hitter last year who nearly won Saturday's game, missing a pinch-hit home run with a drive that landed a few feet foul, Hampton relishes his contributions as a hitter, a base runner and a fielder. Besides the single and run scored, he deflected a ball up the middle that went for an out in the third and made another standout play on a comebacker in the sixth.</p>
        <p>''I take real pride in being a complete player,'' Hampton said.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Yesterday's game was the first this year in which Manager BOBBY VALENTINE used only nine players. . . . The right-hander BOBBY J. JONES, who has missed a month with a strained right calf, said he had no problems in his bullpen throwing session yesterday, and the Mets plan to have him start on Thursday against Colorado. . . . Shortstop REY ORDONEZ, who has inflammation in his right shoulder, took batting practice and made a few soft throws yesterday, but he will not be ready to return to the lineup when the Mets play their next game, tomorrow night against the Rockies.</p>
