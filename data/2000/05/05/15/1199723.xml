        <p>The Justice Department's announcement last week that it was prepared to file a civil rights lawsuit against the Police Department was embarrassing news for this city.

        <p>The Justice Department's announcement last week that it was prepared to file a civil rights lawsuit against the Police Department was embarrassing news for this city. But it was only the latest in a series of federal actions and oversight efforts that in some important ways have made greater Los Angeles a virtual ward of Washington.</p>
        <p>Already, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is operating under -- and contesting the interpretation of -- a federal court consent decree that could require it to buy hundreds of new buses to improve its aging and crowded fleet. The budget of Los Angeles County itself is being kept afloat by a federal waiver of Medicaid rules that the Clinton administration granted in 1995 and that is up for renewal next month.</p>
        <p>And now, the Police Department and the city government face the prospect of another consent decree, in which the police would agree to make changes in training -- some of them proposed nearly a decade ago -- to avoid a federal civil rights lawsuit. In the best outcome from the city's perspective, a consent decree could give an outside federal judge or monitor final say over important issues like internal police investigations, anticorruption measures, officer training and even department budgeting, if precedents in smaller cities are any guide.</p>
        <p>''It's a damning indictment of L.A.'s leaders that Washington had to come in and threaten the L.A.P.D. as it once did small-town Southern sheriffs,'' The Los Angeles Times said in a stinging editorial that also attacked the city's ''so-called leadership'' as rudderless.</p>
        <p>Scores of cities around the nation operate under various consent decrees, on issues like housing, schools, the environment, voting rights and law enforcement. But the degree of federal oversight in Los Angeles, the nation's second-largest city, stands out, and the latest threat landed with a particular thud in a sprawling, diffuse city that seems forever at pains to create any unifying or galvanizing sense of itself.</p>
        <p>In a sharp letter to city officials, the Justice Department said that it had found systemic abuses of power by the police here, including improper shootings, improper arrests and searches with insufficient cause. The Justice Department said it was still  investigating accusations of racial discrimination by officers in the course of their duties. The federal investigation has happened to coincide with a separate local inquiry into evidence tampering, brutality and false testimony that amounts to the city's worst police corruption scandal in decades.</p>
        <p>''I think there is a failure of leadership, and it is generic,'' said Zev Yaroslavsky, a member of the powerful County Board of Supervisors and a 25-year veteran of city politics. ''And the reason for it is there is a disconnect between the people who have political power, including minorities who have political power, and the people they are empowered to represent and serve. In each of these cases, it's a failure of people in power to make difficult decisions and do what needs to be done.''</p>
        <p>In the late 1970's, the Los Angeles police and fire departments faced federal lawsuits over discrimination in the hiring of minorities. Those lawsuits were finally settled with consent decrees. For even longer than that, since the Watts riots of 1965, the city has grappled with the notion of an outside monitor for the Police Department. After the 1991 police beating of a black motorist, Rodney G. King, a commission led by Warren M. Christopher recommended a raft of changes, including the creation of an inspector general's post, which was created by voters in a 1995 referendum.</p>
        <p>But the first inspector general resigned after less than three years, complaining that the police were withholding access to necessary records, and the second still operates with just a skeleton staff. Such problems left the inspector unable to ''conduct meaningful oversight'' in a ''consistent, ongoing manner,'' the acting assistant attorney general for civil rights, Bill Lann Lee, said in a letter last week to the city attorney, James K. Hahn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee, a civil rights lawyer, is a former Western regional counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, which filed the suit that led to the consent decree on the buses. As a result, officials here acknowledge, Mr. Lee is particularly conversant with the history and politics of accusations of police misconduct.</p>
        <p>Mayor Richard J. Riordan and other city officials agreed last week to begin negotiations on a voluntary settlement that could avoid a federal lawsuit, but their options are limited.</p>
        <p>''I think there's a broad pattern of mismanagement and corruption,'' said State Senator Tom Hayden, a longtime scourge of the city administration. ''It's institutionalized in very large agencies with public subsidies and very little oversight, and it's an interesting paradox, because the original concept of L.A. was to keep it from having the waste and corruption of big Eastern cities by creating a form of government that wasn't very politicized and based more on administration.''</p>
        <p>But now, Mr. Hayden said, a system in which departments like the police are run by a civilian commission, whose members are appointed by the mayor but not fully accountable to him or anyone, is a recipe for entrenched bureaucracies to behave as they choose.</p>
        <p>''The bureaucratic beast waits for term limits, waits for the passage of time and waits for the reformers to go away,'' Mr. Hayden said.</p>
        <p>In fact, local political experts say, part of the problem is cultural, in a city where the Police Department has long held sway over much of the civic administration with a ''Dragnet'' image of power, and where the automobile has long been the dominant mode of transportation. Despite a 1996 consent decree that set specific deadlines and limits on crowding on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority's bus fleet, the authority is contesting a federal judge's order that it buy 248 new buses, arguing that that constitutes undue interference.</p>
        <p>Erica J. Teasley, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund's Western regional counsel who is arguing the bus case in federal appeals court, and who has called for major changes in police training and management, said she did not see the Justice Department's latest intervention as any badge of shame.</p>
        <p>''If you have institutional problems and deeply rooted problems within the city and it seems you can't improve the situation on your own, then someone's going to need to help you do it,'' Ms. Teasley said. ''At this point, I think we would welcome any entity that could come in and help Los Angeles and the L.A.P.D. improve the way they operate, and make sure they straighten up and fly right.''</p>
