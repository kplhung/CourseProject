        <p>As David Lewis explained, you have to hit bottom before you can bounce back.</p>
        <p>And this morning, when Mr. Lewis had his first opportunity to look out of a bus window and observe the blackened ruins that were his house in Los Alamos, he said he found himself plunging to an emotional nadir after the fire that has swept through the deeply scarred, austerely beautiful canyons here.</p>
        <p>''I've started all over before, but I've always carried those boxes that have those mementos that are really heavy duty,'' said Mr. Lewis, who works as a systems specialist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory, which conducts nuclear weapons research. ''I don't have that this time. There was nothing.''</p>
        <p>The fire that has destroyed more than 42,000 acres continued to expand today, driven by a resurgence of the winds. But today also marked the symbolic beginning of the area's emotional recovery.</p>
        <p>The New Mexico National Guard organized bus tours for residents whose homes had been destroyed, which left every 20 minutes starting at about 8:30 a.m. from an armory outside town.</p>
        <p>The people who joined these emotional journeys were told they could not leave the buses or collect any belongings; the purpose was just to end one process, clinging to false hopes, and begin another, rebuilding.</p>
        <p>The scene at the armory under a scorching sun was solemn, melancholy and resigned, with only faint sparks of the kind of restorative energy that will be needed to rebuild the city of Los Alamos, 30 miles to the north.</p>
        <p>The authorities, however, announced one particularly satisfying piece of news: the roughly 7,000 residents of White Rock, a suburb of Los Alamos that suffered no actual fire damage, were permitted to return to their homes. They said the roads to White Rock were crowded, but people were moving in an orderly manner.</p>
        <p>The roughly 11,000 residents of Los Alamos may have to wait until the end of the week to return home.</p>
        <p>That was little solace to the more than 300 people who had accepted the offer to take the sobering bus trip back to their neighborhoods in Los Alamos. These were people who had already been told their homes had been reduced to cinders and twisted scraps of steel and plastic.</p>
        <p>The roughly four-hour trips began quietly. Each bright yellow school bus took 20 to 35 residents, along with two grief counselors and several National Guard troops.</p>
        <p>As they boarded, many residents were handed little brown teddy bears and a bag containing work gloves donated by an insurance company.</p>
        <p>''I just kept thinking: none of those things we had can be replaced,'' Lou Pierotti, a retired store owner who had lived in Los Alamos for 49 years, said after he got off his bus. ''People were kind of emotional, but it was quiet, very quiet. All you could see was the outlines of where our house had been.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pierotti said he had lived on Arizona Street, where all the houses had been destroyed. As he stood by his car in the armory's parking lot, absorbing what he had experienced this morning, he said his most painful feelings were for the small, sentimental losses, like his softball trophies.</p>
        <p>''You just realize you can never, never get those things back,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Kim Lalley, a spokeswoman for the New Mexico National Guard, said that in spite of the warnings that no one would be allowed to get out of the buses in Los Alamos, several people had demanded a closer look at what was left of their homes.</p>
        <p>''They were upset, and they wanted to inspect their property,'' Ms. Lalley said. ''We can't force them to stay on the buses. So we let them off and then informed the state police they were there.''</p>
        <p>Robin Peterson, who works for Los Alamos County, said people on the buses mostly watched, took photos and stared in silence. There were a few tears, she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewis said he had decided to take the trip because, ''I just wanted the closure.</p>
        <p>''But you still don't know what it's like until you really see it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Robert Olson, who also lost his home, said: ''I'm numb. I'm confused.''</p>
        <p>Firefighters said today that they did not expect the fire, which had been set on May 4 by the National Park Service in what was supposed to be a controlled burn, to return to heavily populated areas. But swifter winds were causing the flames to leap across some canyons.</p>
        <p>The more than 1,100 firefighters were focusing their efforts in three zones, mostly to the north and northeast, as the fire threatened archaeological sites on the Santa Clara Pueblo, an Indian reservation, and the Baca Ranch, 95,000 acres of meadows and fir-covered mountains that is home to about 7,000 elk.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the United States Forest Service, Jim Paxon, said that if the high winds continued, firefighters might be pulled back and the fire allowed to run its course.</p>
        <p>Many of the people getting off the buses here today expressed appreciation for the efforts being made by firefighters and relief officials.</p>
        <p>''You truly can't believe how generous people have been,'' Ms. Peterson said. ''You see it everywhere. It just feels great. They had computers at one of the relief centers and my 16-year-old daughter was able to get online and find her friends. It just made us feel really good.''</p>
        <p>She said there had long been some resentment in the region of the people who lived in Los Alamos because, with their jobs at the nuclear weapons laboratory, they were generally wealthier and better educated.</p>
        <p>''You saw none of that, not even a little,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But there was also a steady undercurrent of anger at the park service for starting the blaze.</p>
        <p>''When all is said and done, I had to ask myself this morning, 'Why was I on that bus?' '' Mr. Lewis said. ''Darn right, I'm mad.''</p>
