        <p>While a demoralized United Nations force in Sierra Leone awaits the rebel advance on the capital, Freetown, the U.N. system's astounding inability to learn from past mistakes is on display once again.</p>
        <p>As in Bosnia, the Security Council dispatched peacekeepers to enforce a peace that did not exist. As in Rwanda, member countries supplied troops without the capacity to defend themselves. As in Somalia, forces have been sucked into a civil war without the means and the will to prevail. Once again, peacekeepers have been taken hostage. In 1995, the Bosnian Serbs at least chained them to buildings in full view of cameras. In Sierra Leone, the U.N. can't even find them. And as if that were not enough, U.N. forces have made common cause with a vicious local militia that it was supposed to disarm.</p>
        <p>The U.N. seems to survive only by forgetting. By forgetting, it manages to repress a legacy of shame. In 1994, peacekeepers were forced to watch as Rwandan civilians were hacked to death near their compound. In 1995, a Dutch battalion at Srebrenica allowed thousands of civilians to be massacred by the Bosnian Serbs. Only last autumn, Secretary General Kofi Annan vowed to learn from these catastrophes. Now a new catastrophe unfolds.</p>
        <p>The U.N.'s department of peacekeeping operations knew that the contingents in Sierra Leone were under-strength and poorly equipped, yet failed to protest publicly when the Security Council sent them anyway. Now the U.N. forces in Freetown have to defend themselves against rebels armed with heavy machine guns seized from the U.N. hostages.</p>
        <p>Institutional amnesia locks the United Nations system into a fatal compulsion to repeat. An incorrigible moral narcissism about its own good intentions makes it unable to recognize that its central ideal and instrument -- peacekeeping -- is so flawed that it must be abandoned altogether. The idea of interposing soldiers in blue berets and side arms between two sides had some uses in the interstate wars of the cold war era. It has bankrupted itself in the civil wars since. Traditional peacekeeping only works when states at war want peace. It only works when peacekeepers maintain neutrality.</p>
        <p>Wars like Sierra Leone's are about the destruction of states and the creation of new forms of ethnic majority tyranny, backed by ethnic cleansing. To be neutral here is to be an accomplice in crime. To keep the peace here is to ratify the conquests of evil.</p>
        <p>It is time to bury peacekeeping before it buries the U.N. The Security Council should remain the ultimate source of legitimacy for the use of military force, but the Secretariat should stop running peacekeeping operations, and blue-beret forces should stop going where armed resistance can be expected. Where peace has to be enforced rather than maintained, what's required are combat-capable warriors under robust rules of engagement, with armor, ammunition and intelligence capability and a single line of command to a national government or regional alliance.</p>
        <p>Since Africa lacks a NATO of its own, the chain of command must be led by a regional power, like Nigeria.  In Sierra Leone, the U.N. contingent will have to hold on until it can be evacuated. Once the blue helmets are out of the way, green helmets can go in. The Security Council could then declare the rebels a threat to peace and authorize a mission, led by Nigeria, with Western logistical help, to crush the rebels and restore order.</p>
        <p>Sierra Leone demonstrates the futility of neutrality itself. There are a few cases -- and Sierra Leone is one of them -- when the international community has to take sides and do so with crushing force. But the largest lesson of all is that peacekeeping is destroying the United Nations itself. If it still values its own survival, it must abandon an ideal it has so comprehensively betrayed.</p>
