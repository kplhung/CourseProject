        <p>Letter from Keith Craw says if information pirates are successful in destroying copyright system, they will be left with world bereft of any worthwhile art (May 10 article)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>If information pirates like Ian Clarke are allowed to have their way and destroy the copyright system (front page, May 10), what they will be left with is a new world bereft of any worthwhile art. What Mr. Clarke and others like him forget is that it is terribly expensive to create art, be it film, music or literature.</p>
        <p>If an artist (or the artist's financial supporter) has no way to recover the costs of producing art, then what will be the incentive to create it? The cost of publishing a novel or recording a song is beyond the means of most people.</p>

        <p>It is already difficult enough for independent artists to produce their art. Let's not shut them down for good.</p>
