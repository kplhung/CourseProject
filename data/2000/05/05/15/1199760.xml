        <p>A yellow-cab driver died early yesterday morning in Manhattan after another driver stabbed him twice in the chest during an argument over a parking space, the police said.</p>
        <p>The fatal stabbing of the cabby, Baurihama Doukoure, 37, of the Bronx, was one of six killings in 24 hours, the most in any 24-hour period  this year in the city and another indication of a persistent increase in the city's homicide rate during the last two years.</p>
        <p>Police statistics through May 7 show that the homicide rate has climbed 7.5 percent this year, and is up 18 percent since 1998, when the Police Department recorded 629 slayings in the city, fewer than any year in decades.</p>
        <p>The two-year rise in the homicide rate cannot be readily explained, the police say, in part because the rates of all other major crimes -- rape, robbery, felony assault, burglary, grand larceny and auto theft -- have declined 10 percent to 26 percent in the same period, according to police statistics. But officials said yesterday that, viewed in that context, the rising rate was not alarming.</p>
        <p>''These appear to be isolated acts of violence,'' said Sgt. Brian Burke, a police spokesman. ''Even with these incidents, we are at a low for homicides that hasn't been experienced since the 1960's.''</p>
        <p>The six slayings were frustrating to the police, nonetheless, because in each case the killers eluded capture, and in some cases the police had no suspects yesterday, officials said.</p>
        <p>The first killing occurred at 10 a.m. Saturday in Queens, when a car pulled up behind a car driven by Derrick Gilmore, who was stopped at a red light at the intersection of 21st Street and 38th Avenue in Ditmars.</p>
        <p>The police said the second driver  left his car, walked up to Mr. Gilmore's car, and fired a pistol five times through the driver's window, striking Mr. Gilmore repeatedly. The gunman then drove away. Mr. Gilmore, 31, died within an hour at Elmhurst Hospital Center.</p>
        <p>The second killing occurred at 11:20 a.m. Saturday in Queens, and was similar to the slaying of Mr. Gilmore. The police said two men --  Marcus Morris, 33, and Dwight Ricketts, 30 -- were in their car at the corner of 110th Avenue and 225th Street near Belmont Park when an unidentified man walked up to the car and opened fire.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morris, of 1548 President Street in Brooklyn, was shot in the head and died instantly, the police said. Mr. Ricketts was shot in the chest and shoulder and was listed in critical condition yesterday at Mary Immaculate Hospital. The gunman fled.</p>
        <p>The third killing occurred just before 3 p.m. Saturday in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. The police said Cliff DeFazio, 30, of 1908 Jerome Avenue, in Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn, was beaten to death by three young men on the street in front of 8 Brighton Fourth Terrace. The police said Mr. DeFazio appeared to know the men, and was arguing with them as they sat inside a white car with Pennsylvania license plates.</p>
        <p>Sergeant Burke said the men stepped out of the car carrying boards or sticks or a wooden club, and beat Mr. DeFazio into unconsciousness and left him on the street. The men drove away, and Mr. DeFazio was pronounced dead at Coney Island Hospital at 3:40 p.m.</p>
        <p>The fourth killing was reported at 5:45 p.m., when Richard Sanders, of 3333 Broadway in Harlem near West 136th Street, was found dead in his apartment by friends. Mr. Sanders, 43, had been stabbed twice in the  chest, the police said.</p>
        <p>The fifth killing was that of Mr. Doukoure, the cabby, and occurred just before 11 p.m. Mr. Doukoure was off-duty near a gas station at West 59th Street and Eleventh Avenue in Manhattan and began arguing over a parking spot with the driver of another car, the police said.</p>
        <p>The argument soon became a fistfight, the police said, and the other driver pulled a knife and stabbed Mr. Doukoure twice in the chest. He died about two hours later at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. The man who stabbed him escaped in his car, described by the police only as a four-door blue sedan.</p>
        <p>The sixth slaying occurred yesterday at 2:30 a.m. at the corner of 61st Street and Fourth Avenue in Brooklyn. The police said Maximo Cortes, 30, of 210 South 20th Street in Brooklyn, was shot once in the stomach during an argument with an unidentified man, who ran away. Mr. Cortes died an hour later at Lutheran Medical Center.</p>
