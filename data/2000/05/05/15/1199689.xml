        <p>IN shortening its annual management conference to two days from three this year, the American Association of Advertising Agencies decided to focus the meeting agenda more narrowly than usual, devoting one general session to creativity and the other to interactive marketing.</p>
        <p>So the estimated 475 attendees at the conference, which ended here on Saturday, frequently heard panelists describe television as a ''lean back'' medium because it is meant to be experienced passively, and the Internet as a ''lean forward'' medium because it is meant to be experienced actively.</p>

        <p>IN shortening its annual management conference to two days from three this year, the American Association of Advertising Agencies decided to focus the meeting agenda more narrowly than usual, devoting one general session to creativity and the other to interactive marketing.</p>
        <p>So the estimated 475 attendees at the conference, which ended here on Saturday, frequently heard panelists describe television as a ''lean back'' medium because it is meant to be experienced passively, and the Internet as a ''lean forward'' medium because it is meant to be experienced actively.</p>
        <p>Those discussions were particularly apt because the association, known as the Four A's, is poised to undergo significant change as several high-profile agency managers agree to take one-year terms at its helm as active ''lean forward'' leaders. A veritable Murderers' Row of Madison Avenue were, are or will be serving as the chairwoman and chairman through 2002. Their goal: infuse the venerable trade organization with more passion, modernity and a commitment to being proactive toward the many challenges facing the industry rather than reactive.</p>
        <p>''We are an industry with a history of being defensive, responding to Hollywood, consultants and the dot-coms,'' said John J. Dooner Jr., president and chief operating officer at the Interpublic Group of Companies, who was elected the 2000-2001 vice chairman of the association. That places him in line to serve as chairman in 2001-2002.</p>
        <p>And the group's outgoing chairwoman, Shelly Lazarus, said, ''We're at a great change point for our industry.'' Ms. Lazarus is chairwoman and chief executive at Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, a unit of the WPP Group, which during the conference became the world's largest advertising company after agreeing to acquire Young &amp; Rubicam Inc. for $4.7 billion.</p>
        <p>''There is a wonderful world of opportunity and change and creativity, the likes of which I've never seen,'' said Ms. Lazarus, the 1999-2000 chairwoman of the Four A's whose term ended during the conference. ''There is more opportunity in our business than we have the people or resources to handle, and that is what I call a real high-class problem.''</p>
        <p>In her remarks, which the audience responded to enthusiastically, Ms. Lazarus offered what she described as a ''confession'': a year ago, she had been ''reluctant'' to take on the duties of chairwoman of an organization she perceived as standing for ''too much golf, too many 50-year-old white men in pastel pants.''</p>
        <p>''At a time of enormous change in the economy and in our industry, I wasn't sure our traditional trade association would notice -- or care,'' Ms. Lazarus said. ''I was wrong. I was very wrong.</p>
        <p>''The current leaders of our industry are now actively involved in this organization,'' she added. ''We are the generation leading the biggest change in our business in decades. It is a glorious time to be in advertising. I think we now have the role we always wished for.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lazarus also praised the permanent staff of the Four A's, including O. Burtch Drake, president and chief executive, as ''all over every issue that is important to our industry.'' In his yearly report to the membership, Mr. Drake echoed Ms. Lazarus's ambitious, lean-forward attitude with a list of 10 key issues the organization must address as identified in a study late last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Drake outlined initiatives across several fronts that range from ''attracting and retaining quality men and women to the advertising agency business in the face of intense competition from the new media'' to answering ''the need for diversity in the workplace'' to undertaking steps ''to promote the value of advertising and advertising agencies in a totally new way.''</p>
        <p>The efforts of the Four A's staff were also complemented by Ms. Lazarus's successor, Philip B. Dusenberry, who now begins his term as the chairman of the association for 2000-2001. In remarks to the second general session, Mr. Dusenberry -- chairman at BBDO New York, part of the BBDO Worldwide division of the Omnicom Group -- made it clear that he too intended to be a lean-forward leader.</p>
        <p>''Major League Baseball has the freedom to bore its customers to death,'' said Mr. Dusenberry, a fan who wrote the screenplay for the baseball film ''The Natural.'' ''Major league advertising, Four A's advertising, does not.</p>
        <p>''For as long as I can remember, the Four A's was viewed as an 'account guy's club' that put the advertising business higher up than the advertising itself,'' he added. ''Creativity always seemed a last-day event at our conferences.</p>
        <p>''We have to make creative and a younger outlook a more central focus of our mission,'' Mr. Dusenberry asserted, listing potential steps like forming a creative directors' review board, requiring ''higher creative standards for admission'' to the Four A's and even issuing membership cards to the employees of agencies that belong.</p>
        <p>It could be the new and improved version of that bad old phrase ''card-carrying member.''</p>
        <p>Even with a compressed agenda, the Four A's still found time to give out its annual honors, known as the O'Toole Creative Awards.</p>
        <p>For general excellence during 1999, Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners in New York, part of the Lowe Group unit of Interpublic, won for agencies with billings of more than $30 million. It was the first time Lowe Lintas had won the award. DeVito/Verdi in New York won for agencies with billings of less than $30 million, for the fifth time in six years.</p>
        <p>The O'Toole Awards for multicultural advertising were presented to three agencies. For the second consecutive year Vigilante in New York, part of the B Com3  Group, won for work aimed at black consumers. Conill Advertising in New York, owned by Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, won for work aimed at Spanish-speaking consumers; the agency tied for first last year in that category. And Admerasia in New York won for work in the ''other multicultural'' category.</p>
        <p>Finally, the O'Toole Awards for public service advertising were given to Crispin Porter &amp; Bogusky in Miami, for television work, and Sawyer Riley Compton in Atlanta for print work.</p>
        <p>In keeping with the changes being considered by the Four A's leaders, Mr. Dusenberry said he would like the organization to study ways to raise the profile of the O'Tooles, like adding cash prizes, asking clients to attend the ceremony and moving it to the annual creative conference in the fall from the annual management conference in the spring.</p>
