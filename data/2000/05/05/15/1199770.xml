        <p>In a direct challenge to nation states in Europe, Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister, has proposed the creation of a European federation with a directly elected president and parliament sharing real executive and legislative powers.</p>
        <p>His appeal for the foundation of a federation in which power would shift from national governments to a central European administration comes at a time when the 15-member European Union is pondering how to manage its expansion. It is certain to cause concern in states like Britain that are wary of any dilution of their sovereignty.</p>
        <p>''A European federation means nothing less than a European government and parliament that effectively exercise legislative and executive powers within the federation,'' Mr. Fischer said in a speech at Berlin's Humboldt University. The alternative in an enlarged European Union, he suggested, would be paralysis.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fischer said that he was expressing himself in a personal capacity and as a Green Party member of the German Parliament, rather than in his capacity as foreign minister. Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, a Social Democrat, has never proposed a European vision remotely as radical.</p>
        <p>The European Union now finds itself in an awkward half-way stage  where the introduction of a single currency, the euro, has not been accompanied by any similar integration of its political institutions.</p>
        <p>As a result, the fiscal policies that back the shared currency may vary from nation to nation, an evident source of potential weakness to a currency that has recently fallen steeply against the dollar.</p>
        <p>The union is also at a crossroads with respect to its expansion. The current institutions, whose apex is a Council of Ministers from the 15 member states that meets periodically to make decisions generally requiring unanimity, have already become strained and ponderous.  ''The answer is simple,'' Mr. Fischer said on Friday. ''The passage from an alliance of states to a real parliamentarism within a European federation as Robert Schuman suggested 50 years ago. I am aware that the word federation is like waving a red rag to a bull for many in Britain, but I know of no other word.''</p>
        <p>Since the foundation of the European Union, there has often been a tension between those favoring a United States of Europe that would be a true federation and those more inclined to see the union as a trade and commercial alliance involving intense cooperation, but not a radical erosion of the European nation state.</p>
        <p>The six founding members -- Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Italy -- have been those most ready to work toward the vision of a United States of Europe, while countries that joined later -- like Britain and the Scandinavian states -- have been skeptical.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fischer proposed the eventual enactment of a constitutional treaty that would set out which powers were to be shifted to the new European executive and parliament, and those that remained at national level. At present, the European Parliament has limited powers.</p>
        <p>As a first step toward this new treaty, the 11 members of the European Union that already adhere to the euro should move toward what he called ''a politico-economic union,'' through which issues like the environment, immigration, security and foreign policy would be decided at a European rather than national level.</p>
        <p>These states, he said, should then sign a first accord introducing ''a government that should speak with the single voice of the union on the greatest number of questions possible, a parliament and a directly elected president.'' This would provide the ''locomotive'' for the formal shift to a federation.</p>
