        <p>Sean Lambert and Shenae Dawkins, who each won three gold medals, were named the outstanding male and female athletes at the 33rd annual Loucks Games for high schools, held in White Plains, N.Y. So it was not surprising their respective high schools captured the team titles. Lambert's South Shore of Brooklyn edged Deep Creek of Chesapeake, Va., to win the boys' crown with 51 points to 50 by Deep Creek. Dawkins's New Rochelle team easily took the girls' title with 61 points.</p>
