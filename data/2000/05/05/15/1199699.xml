        <p>Our subject is the modern female body, that perpetual subject -- and object -- of manipulation, contemplation, rank distaste, celebration and reinvention.</p>
        <p>Take the girls and women on the recent MTV special ''Sisqo's 100 Sexiest Hip-Hop Videos.'' True to his own popular anthem, ''Thong Song,'' Sisqo reaffirms the cultural fact that backsides are, well . . . back . . . and that people want them to be as round as bowling balls and as ostentatious as bustles. There's a battle of class and race taste going on here, too: one video starts with a white woman making fun of a black woman's size. But this is a multiracial obsession, as anyone who goes to a gym knows. (Not to mention all the impassioned debates about whether Jennifer Lopez should have lost weight in order to look more like a Hollywood queen and less like a homegirl.)</p>

        <p>Our subject is the modern female body, that perpetual subject -- and object -- of manipulation, contemplation, rank distaste, celebration and reinvention.</p>
        <p>Take the girls and women on the recent MTV special ''Sisqo's 100 Sexiest Hip-Hop Videos.'' True to his own popular anthem, ''Thong Song,'' Sisqo reaffirms the cultural fact that backsides are, well . . . back . . . and that people want them to be as round as bowling balls and as ostentatious as bustles. There's a battle of class and race taste going on here, too: one video starts with a white woman making fun of a black woman's size. But this is a multiracial obsession, as anyone who goes to a gym knows. (Not to mention all the impassioned debates about whether Jennifer Lopez should have lost weight in order to look more like a Hollywood queen and less like a homegirl.)</p>
        <p>Ah, the markers of cultural difference, as they say in the academy. In a fashion magazine feature on the women of Brazil -- a tribute to the implacably handsome model Gisele -- one of her countrymen declares: ''There are no busts in Brazil. It's bottoms country. Surgery is about breast reduction, not implants.''</p>
        <p>Don't try to imagine a United States without implants; just try to conjure the Oscars or the Grammy Awards without them. We may not have many Stepford wives these days. We have legions of Stepford plastic-surgery patients.</p>
        <p>Weight and cleavage are crucial to the class (and caste) systems of beauty and desirability. Displays of cleavage used to be left to showgirls, actresses and whores. Now, toned down, they can be spotted on society pages everywhere. When it comes to upward mobility, though, slimness still rules.</p>
        <p>You'll notice in hip-hop videos that the fleshier girls -- busy writhing and twisting to the beat in clubs or on the street where the rapper expostulates, pontificates and reiterates -- are in the raunchier locales. As the mininarrative shows the rapper moving up (better cars, better clubs, better neighborhoods), the women stay in bikinis or nightclub-cutie gear, but they get thinner. (And lighter, too: they move to high brown and high yellow, multiethnic and all-white looks.)</p>
        <p>Look at L'il Kim and Mary J. Blige, those ghetto queens of hip-hop and R-and-B. Now that they're in cosmetics ads and front-row seats at couture fashion shows, they've lost weight. It helps convince the world that their look -- a strategic pile-up of fabrics, furs, jewels, wigs and makeup -- can be designated a choice instead of a lapse of style. Call it Urban Excess Expressionism.</p>
        <p>Which is really the point with a woman's body.  What does she consider a choice or a lapse when she studies, uses and dresses it? What rules and responses does the culture impose? What weight, how much muscle are appropriate? What body parts are deemed unseemly and embarrassing? And what happens when these rules and responses start to change?</p>
        <p>Look at Mode, a fashion magazine for the woman who is -- what are the appropriate adjectives right now? Going through its pages I found ''full-figured,'' ''big'' and ''larger-size,'' while the cover logo reads, ''The New Shape in Fashion.'' Mock if you must the conspicuous absence of the word ''fat.'' If fat still had a few of its more pleasant associations -- dictionary definitions include ''plump,'' ''well-fed,'' ''plentiful'' and ''abundant'' -- it would belong in Mode.</p>
        <p>All fashion language combines hyperbole, euphemism and propaganda. Fleshpot beauties reigned through the 1950's. After that, once-negative words like ''skinny,'' ''thin'' and ''bony'' were given a linguistic version of cosmetic surgery. My only objection to Mode is a certain tameness. The editors could take more risks with the clothes and with the photography. The women look too static. And why not take some chances with the language?</p>
        <p>Still, it's always worth watching a female body do what nothing has prepared us to expect. And we're still most likely to find this in sports and art, where the practitioners get to exceed or challenge the norm and the spectators get to respond in ways everyday life doesn't encourage.</p>
        <p>Take ''Picturing the Modern Amazon,'' for instance, a show at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo through June. It left me agog: exhilarated, appalled, squeamish and charmed, in rapid sequence and sometimes all at once.</p>
        <p>Here, too, language is finding its way. ''Amazon'' is an all-purpose, mythologically resonant word. But the women themselves (seen in photographs and videos) use practical words like ''bodybuilders'' and ''hypermuscular.'' They are professionals who spend hours in the gym and hours at competitions. (You might remember some of them from the 1984 documentary ''Pumping Iron II.'') And their 19th-century predecessors were the equivalent of strongmen, circus acrobats and aerialists, women who could lift weights, men, furniture and even canons. (In France, the cannon lifter, Miss Lala, the Mulatto, was painted by Degas; her partner went by the name Kaira Le Blanc.)</p>
        <p>Bodybuilding competitions took off in the 1970's and are still going strong. Some of the women prefer power lifting. Bev Francis can do a 501-pound dead lift. Some devote themselves to the body-sculpturing routines, filled with poses that seem derived from early modern dance, early hip-hop and Greco-Roman tableaux vivants. They see themselves as constantly evolving works of art.</p>
        <p>''I don't just train in the gym,'' Adrulla Blanchette emphasizes. ''I plan. I draw sketches and plans.'' I like her especially  because she claims the aesthetic license of many artists in this show, Louise Bourgeois, Cindy Sherman and Robert Crumb, among them. ''Art doesn't have to mean beauty,'' she says.</p>
        <p>Cindy Sherman's Amazon is a slimy doll with mismatched stuck-on limbs and a helmet head, part robot, part Fu Manchu. Andres Serrano's photograph of Lesa Lewis is reverent: oiled, gleaming and brown she sits in profile against a bright blue sky, a red thong threaded around her monumental torso. In Sarah Van Ouwerkerk's photograph ''Mother and Daughter'' a young girl in a skirt and sleeveless top that shows her healthy but slender arms, rests her head on her mother's knee.</p>
        <p>But what a knee. It belongs to the bodybuilder Jennifer Greenbaum and moves down into a big sinewy calf and upward into a massive, utterly taut thigh, just contained by white pedal-pushers. We see Jennifer's hand on her daughter's back, its bulging vein against her hair. The familiar and the unfamiliar pull at each other with equal weight.</p>
        <p>The comic book section of the show is pure uninhibited fantasy -- revenge, lust, apocalypse -- via every kind of visual extreme. Wonder Woman is here, of course, but so are the Sensational She-Hulk; Jodi the Atomic Age Amazon; Sustah-Girl, Queen of the Black Age; and the Horny Biker Slut.</p>
        <p>The bodybuilder Nathalie Gassel calls herself ''a sculpture of thinking flesh,'' while Rene Toney wants to be: ''A freak, a genetic freak. A genetic celebrity.''</p>
        <p>What I want is at least one of these hypermuscular, mind-boggling everyday Amazons to get a shot at the kind of career Arnold Schwarzenegger has.</p>
