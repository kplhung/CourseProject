        <p>So many unusual things happened at the GTE Byron Nelson Classic, it was fitting that a player wearing pink pants won. Capitalizing on his opponents' mistakes and prevailing today in a playoff with Davis Love III and Phil Mickelson, Jesper Parnevik captured a dramatic victory on the third hole of sudden death.</p>
        <p>Love missed two pressure putts that cost him dearly -- a seven-footer on the final hole of regulation that could have won the tournament, and a four-footer on the last hole of sudden death that allowed Parnevik to win with a par.</p>
        <p>Mickelson, who was eliminated on the second extra hole, also made a costly mistake when he bogeyed the final hole of regulation, allowing Parnevik and Love to tie him. So while Love and Mickelson pondered what could have been, Parnevik savored his second victory this year, which gave him more than $2.13 million in earnings.</p>
        <p>The tournament ended after Love chipped to four feet on the third playoff hole, but then missed his putt for par. After the crowd groaned, Parnevik made his three-footer for par, shook hands with Love and enjoyed a satisfying victory, pink pants and all.</p>
        <p>''I've never had a year like this,'' said Parnevik, a 35-year-old native of Sweden, who also won this year's Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. ''I'm really looking forward to the U.S. Open.''</p>
        <p>Parnevik overcame a miscue when he missed a one-foot putt at No. 12 that led to a bogey. Professional golfers rarely miss one-footers, and some players would have been too shaken to recover. But Parnevik birdied No. 14 and No. 15, then outlasted two of the world's top players to win.</p>
        <p>''I don't know how I missed that putt,'' Parnevik said of No. 12. ''It just snap-sliced. At that point, I didn't see how I was going to get in the playoff. But then I watched the leader board, saw Davis drop a few, and I was right back in the game.''</p>
        <p>Parnevik shot a solid four-under-par 66 in regulation, Mickelson shot a 65, and Love shot a 69 as they all finished 11 under par (269) through 72 holes.</p>
        <p>Tiger Woods, who tied with John Huston for fourth place at 10 under par, sent quivers through the gallery with a masterly final-round 63, almost getting into the playoff as well.</p>
        <p>Completing his round well before the leaders, Woods barely missed a 15-foot birdie attempt at No. 18, then waited as Parnevik, Mickelson and Love all finished one stroke ahead of him.</p>
        <p>Woods jump-started his exciting run by making an eagle at the par-4 No. 4, where he holed his second shot with a wedge from 99 yards. After a weekend session with his coach, Butch Harmon, who took a red-eye flight Friday night into Dallas from Las Vegas, Woods felt much better about the state of his game.</p>
        <p>''I thought I made that last putt, but I played beautifully today,'' Woods said. ''The only time I felt frustrated was when I missed putts.''</p>
        <p>But Woods did not feel as frustrated as Love, who has not won since the 1998 MCI Classic, a span of 48 tournaments and 25 months.</p>
        <p>Love has finished second seven times since his last victory, and this loss was one of his most perturbing. He started the third round with a four-stroke lead, and he began today at the Four Seasons TPC tied with Huston for first place.</p>
        <p>Love reached the 18th green tied with Mickelson and Parnevik, with a chance to win. But with the outcome of the tournament in his control, on the blade of his putter, Love watched in agony as his seven-foot putt slid past the hole.</p>
        <p>Parnevik and Mickelson watched from beside the 18th green, and when Love's putt missed, they knew they still had a chance, and Love knew he was in danger of losing again. Ultimately, he did.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, I'm disappointed,'' Love said. ''I peeked on the last putt and pulled it. If I had taken care of business yesterday and today, I could have put it out of reach.''</p>
        <p>Mickelson was 12 under par after 71 holes, but he bogeyed the 72nd, hitting a bad tee shot into the left rough and then burying his second shot into a terrible lie in a bunker by the green. Mickelson could not get up and down for par, and his bogey dropped him back into a tie for the lead.</p>
        <p>Then Mickelson was eliminated on the second playoff hole, after Love made a 25-foot birdie putt. Mickelson's 20-foot attempt for birdie just lipped out, and then Parnevik made a five-footer for birdie to keep his hopes alive.</p>
        <p>''I lost the tournament on the 18th in regulation,'' said Mickelson, who was looking for his third victory this year. ''Every shot I hit into the bunkers this week plugged. You had to avoid the bunkers like the plague.''</p>
        <p>So Parnevik, one of the game's free spirits, enjoyed the fourth victory of his PGA Tour career. Asked about his pink pants, Parnevik said, ''They're nice pants.''</p>
        <p>And for Parnevik, it was a nice victory.</p>
