        <p>Savion Glover has a lot to answer for. The latest revue to follow the format of Mr. Glover's post-''Noise-Funk'' shows is ''The Beat,'' performed on Thursday night at the Context Studios. The recipe is a little tap, a little music and a little poetry of a sort that hovers between rap and slam verse. ''The Beat'' is faithful to the genre, linking the elements with verbal musings on rhythm and the downbeat as metaphors for emotional and physical states and cultural diversity.</p>
        <p>The problem is the secondhand nature of the enterprise. Very little seems to come from the heart or life. Appropriation is in the air. And neither Kamal Sinclair, who conceived the show, nor most of the performers seem to have had enough theater experience to overcome the generally limp material. A series of embarrassingly unconvincing soliloquies for each of the six chorus dancers sounds like a bad imitation of Ntozake Shange's ''For Colored Girls.''</p>

        <p>Savion Glover has a lot to answer for. The latest revue to follow the format of Mr. Glover's post-''Noise-Funk'' shows is ''The Beat,'' performed on Thursday night at the Context Studios. The recipe is a little tap, a little music and a little poetry of a sort that hovers between rap and slam verse. ''The Beat'' is faithful to the genre, linking the elements with verbal musings on rhythm and the downbeat as metaphors for emotional and physical states and cultural diversity.</p>
        <p>The problem is the secondhand nature of the enterprise. Very little seems to come from the heart or life. Appropriation is in the air. And neither Kamal Sinclair, who conceived the show, nor most of the performers seem to have had enough theater experience to overcome the generally limp material. A series of embarrassingly unconvincing soliloquies for each of the six chorus dancers sounds like a bad imitation of Ntozake Shange's ''For Colored Girls.''</p>
        <p>There are exceptions. Baakari Wilder works his usual magic in a few sadly abbreviated tap numbers. The buttery flow, keen articulation and subtle accents of his footwork are too often overwhelmed by the rest of the stage action. There is more truth in the gangling, comical droop of Mr. Wilder's torso than in anything else in the show. But he spends most of his time hanging around at the back of the stage.</p>
        <p>Robert Sinclair has a witty number as a ''Britrocker,'' a rapper whose Cockney accent and swagger are almost impenetrable. Karida Griffith is a proficient tap dancer and injects a welcome note of sweetness. Tasneem Nanji has presence, too, whether playing the saxophone or blurting her way with endearing but perhaps unintentional nuttiness through a bit of rap.</p>
        <p>The lead performers also included Mustafa Shakir, LuQuantumLeap and Candice Anitra Manson. ''The Beat,'' created in collaboration with Robbie McCauley and Mr. Shakir, continues through Saturday at Context (28 Avenue A, East Village).</p>
