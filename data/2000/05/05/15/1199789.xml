        <p>Kaye Ballard</p>
        <p>Arci's Place</p>
        <p>For Kaye Ballard, that indefatigably cheery one-woman variety show, there is no doubt that the good old  days of show business were a lot better than the loud, profanity-ridden present. And without being snooty about it, Ms. Ballard, who is in her 70's and still has enough energy for several performers, shows how it  used to be done by doing it all. (Or almost all: she doesn't dance.) Ms. Ballard sings, mugs, plays the flute, does impersonations, reminisces and tells jokes, swinging from screwball comedy to warmhearted pathos with the fleet timing of a classic vaudevillian.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ballard, who is playing a rare cabaret engagement through June 3, has always been an outspoken fan. And her new act, ''Another Final Farewell Appearance,'' directed by Barry Kleinbort, is among other things a series of tributes to assorted idols.</p>

        <p>Kaye Ballard</p>
        <p>Arci's Place</p>
        <p>For Kaye Ballard, that indefatigably cheery one-woman variety show, there is no doubt that the good old  days of show business were a lot better than the loud, profanity-ridden present. And without being snooty about it, Ms. Ballard, who is in her 70's and still has enough energy for several performers, shows how it  used to be done by doing it all. (Or almost all: she doesn't dance.) Ms. Ballard sings, mugs, plays the flute, does impersonations, reminisces and tells jokes, swinging from screwball comedy to warmhearted pathos with the fleet timing of a classic vaudevillian.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ballard, who is playing a rare cabaret engagement through June 3, has always been an outspoken fan. And her new act, ''Another Final Farewell Appearance,'' directed by Barry Kleinbort, is among other things a series of tributes to assorted idols.</p>
        <p>Among those honored are Alice Faye, the composer Cy Coleman and his great lyric collaborators Dorothy Fields and Carolyn Leigh, Mabel Mercer, Jimmy Durante, Ms. Ballard's own Italian grandmother and her former accompanist and longtime collaborator Arthur Siegel, who died several years ago. She tops it off late in her show by reeling off half a dozen Henny Youngman jokes.</p>
        <p>Threaded through the evening are songs, jokes and remarks in which she acknowledges the depredations of old age with a good-natured bravery. An incisively funny Coleman-Fields song, ''After 40, It's Patch, Patch, Patch,'' wittily lists nearly everything that can (and usually does) go wrong with our bodies as we head into the twilight years.</p>
        <p>If some of the material is hopelessly corny and out of date and Ms. Ballard's singing voice wobbly, with few high notes left, she makes up for it with the warmth of her gregarious personality. More than just remembering those good old days, she embodies them, forcefully reminding us at every step just how good they really were.</p>
