        <p>Over the last several months, Gov. George E. Pataki has become one of the most visible pitchmen of the airwaves, starring in no fewer than five television advertising campaigns paid for by state agencies under his control, for causes from children's health care to energy conservation, at a total cost to taxpayers of about $20 million.</p>
        <p>Put another way, the state is spending as much money from the public treasury to put Mr. Pataki's face before the public as the total spent in his 1998 re-election campaign.</p>
        <p>The spots advertise Mr. Pataki at least as much as their ostensible subjects, prompting the charge by government reform groups and Democrats that they are nothing more than a veiled political campaign at government expense. ''To use public funds to do what are essentially P.R. spots for the governor is ridiculous,'' said Rachel Leon, executive director of the New York State chapter of Common Cause. ''It doesn't pass the smell test. If it looks like politics, it's politics.''</p>
        <p>Michael McKeon, Mr. Pataki's communications director, said of such criticism, ''The world is, unfortunately, full of cynics who would rather play politics than applaud accomplishments.''</p>
        <p>The governor, a Republican, is not the first politician to use his power to advertise himself with public money, nor the first to be criticized for it. In fact, the immediate response from several administration officials was that the same thing has been done by the governor's predecessor, Mario M. Cuomo, by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York, by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and by Gov. John G. Rowland of Connecticut.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Pataki's current exposure is extraordinary, and it far exceeds the others' efforts. In addition to ads for children's health care, energy conservation and the environment, which are all new this year, the governor is starring in perennial campaigns promoting tourism and the state's economic recovery. And while some governments, like New York City's and Connecticut's, prohibit politicians from appearing in advertising at public expense when an election is approaching, New York State's has no such restrictions.</p>
        <p>Politicians in both parties say -- Republicans with a hint of admiration, Democrats with exasperation -- that the commercials are an extension of an administration that has turned governing into a perpetual campaign.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Pataki has said he has no interest in running for the United States Senate this year, state Republican leaders are talking about Mr. Pataki as a possible replacement candidate if Mayor Giuliani decides to drop out. Mr. Pataki has said he might run for a third term in 2002, when his Democratic opponent could be the state's comptroller, H. Carl McCall.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Pataki has been battered by his leading role in state Republicans' ultimately unsuccessful efforts to keep John McCain off the presidential primary ballot. And he has also been harshly attacked, both through paid ads and on op-ed pages, by Change New York, a conservative group of onetime Pataki supporters who now call him a big-spending liberal. At the same time, the governor's poll numbers have slipped. His approval rating remains above 50 percent in most published surveys, but a year ago it was more than 60 percent.</p>
        <p>''Is it about helping the governor?'' a Republican political consultant asked rhetorically about the ad campaigns. ''Well, duh.''</p>
        <p>Judith Hope, chairwoman of the state Democratic Party, said, ''We are seeing a remarkable attempt at the rehabilitation of George Pataki at taxpayers' expense.''</p>
        <p>The promotions all showcase Mr. Pataki in the kind of warm-and-fuzzy ways that are too leisurely for the frantic pace of a real campaign. They deal with issues that let him appeal across party lines to centrists and liberals and that rank high with women, who tend to prefer Democrats to Republicans. The ads have been most prevalent during morning and daytime television, when most viewers are women. The best example is also the biggest of the current campaigns, one intended to encourage parents to enroll their children in Child Health Plus, a state-subsidized health insurance program for low-income parents. The State Department of Health spent $8 million on the ads.</p>
        <p>In the television ad, Mr. Pataki, wearing a baby-blue V-neck sweater, speaks into the camera, sitting in a bright room amid happy children of all races. Next to him sits the state health commissioner, Dr. Antonia C. Novello, who happens to be one of the few women, and the only Hispanic, among the administration's top officials. The ads have been broadcast in every part of the state since October, including a Spanish-language version in some markets, and will continue through late June.</p>
        <p>''These ads are clearly to promote him, and they're another example of how he's not acting like a person who's getting out of public life at the end of his term,'' said Jeffrey M. Stonecash, a professor of political science at Syracuse University who conducts polls for Democratic and Republican politicians. He added that it was as if Mr. Pataki was ''worried about the liberal base getting mobilized in ways that it didn't in '94 and '98.''</p>
        <p>The ads represent a certain contradiction. During the 1994 gubernatorial campaign, William D. Powers, the state Republican Party chairman, attacked Mr. Cuomo for planning a government-financed ad campaign featuring himself, an effort that ultimately fell through. ''If Mario Cuomo wants to develop an ad campaign for his re-election bid, he ought to pay for it himself,'' Mr. Powers said then.</p>
        <p>This is just one instance of Mr. Pataki's doing much the same thing that he or his surrogates criticized his predecessor for doing: Mr. Cuomo's proposed buyout of the Long Island Lighting Company, his frequent use of state aircraft and his paid speaking engagements.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKeon contended that ''people know and trust the governor,'' making him the logical spokesman for each of the ads' causes. ''The governor has made no secret of the fact that he's going to do everything he can to promote the changes he's made in New York's economic climate,'' he said. ''It's not enough to do it; you need to tell the world about the changes. No one has better credibility on environmental issues than Governor Pataki. He is the perfect spokesman for encouraging energy conservation.''</p>
        <p>John Signor, spokesman for the Department of Health, said that enrollment in Child Health Plus had climbed rapidly since the campaign began. When asked why the governor should appear in them rather than, for instance, a pop culture figure who would be more familiar and appealing to young parents, he said, ''Well, the ads are working.''</p>
        <p>The state's Empire State Development Corporation is spending $5.5 million from early April through late May on a collection of ads -- $4 million on television, $1.5 million on radio and print media -- that showcase the governor promoting tourism in New York. The ads are running both in New York markets and in a few other Eastern cities. The development agency sponsors a springtime tourism campaign every year, in ads that have often centered on the governor, but the budget this year is up sharply, from $3.7 million last year.</p>
        <p>The same agency paid for a $4 million television and radio campaign in March and April, celebrating the state's economic recovery and promoting the state as a fine place for businesses. Again, the ads ran in New York and other states, and they featured the governor.</p>
        <p>A television ad campaign still under way has Mr. Pataki promoting the Energy Star program, which encourages people to buy energy-efficient appliances. The primary sponsor is the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority.</p>
        <p>Tom Collins, spokesman for the agency, said he was not sure how much the agency was spending or how long the ads would run. But state officials said the energy agency was spending several times as much as the Long Island Power Authority, which contributed $500,000 to the effort in March.</p>
        <p>In February, the Long Island Power Authority spent $175,000 on radio and television ads starring the governor, to let people know of its commitments to clean sources of energy, like wind power.</p>
        <p>''The governor probably is the best pitchman for the state of New York,'' said Nelson Warfield, a Republican political consultant who is on good terms with Mr. Pataki. ''If it benefits him politically, it doesn't mean it comes at the detriment of the state. This is one of those happy political happenstances of everybody benefiting.''</p>
