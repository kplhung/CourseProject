        <p>AN industry's annual convention, like an anniversary, tends to have a celebratory, somewhat self-congratulatory sheen.

        <p>AN industry's annual convention, like an anniversary, tends to have a celebratory, somewhat self-congratulatory sheen. And for all that newspapers are prickly institutions, prone alternately to braggadocio and self-doubt, the attendees at the annual publishers' convention in New York last week did exude satisfaction and confidence.</p>
        <p>Why? After all, newspaper companies' stock prices, as reflected in the Standard &amp; Poor's publishing index, have dropped 16.9 percent from their high at the end of 1999, and are right about where they were at the time of last year's meeting in San Diego of the publishers' group, the Newspaper Association of America. In the same year, dozens of newspaper journalists have deserted print and joined dot-com companies.</p>
        <p>Newsprint prices, next to labor the biggest cost for the factories that are newspapers, are rising as the newsprint companies continue to consolidate and demand from Asia has rebounded. Sunday circulation, the underpinning of the most lucrative advertising of the week for any newspaper, continues its decline. A new breed of print competition, in the form of a free subway-based (and government-sponsored) tabloid, Metro, has started up in Philadelphia and is looking to gain a foothold elsewhere.</p>
        <p>There is no sign that online rivals for classified advertising are fading.</p>
        <p>All that is true. But so is something else. Like the European cartographer who made the Lenox Globe 500 years ago, with the Latin inscription ''Here are dragons'' off the east Asian coast, newspaper executives had begun looking at the Internet as terra incognita, an almost mythical place of revenue-devouring, reader-devouring pixels that would cripple their businesses.</p>
        <p>Now, with three or more years of Internet experience behind them, including both failures and modest successes, when publishers look at the World Wide Web, they don't see business-destroying dragons any more. They see a new breed of competitor, it is true. But they also see themselves. (That, of course, can cut both ways -- newspaper companies like The New York Times Company, Tribune, Knight Ridder and Belo had assembled their Internet assets in a ready form for initial public offerings, only to see the Internet initial offering market go south.)</p>
        <p>The March measurements of the Web-measurement firm Media Metrix showed newspaper sites holding their own against other general-news sites. That doesn't change the fact that all general news sites are far behind the more utilitarian sites like  Citysearch.com. But even Barry Diller, chairman of USA Networks, which is part owner of Ticketmaster Online-CitySearch, told the publishers in a forum last week that he did not think the Internet ''is going to replace paper.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Internet, in the form of dot-com advertising, is driving their old revenue streams to new heights. Coming off a highly successful year in 1999, newspaper advertising revenues at companies like Dow Jones &amp; Company, The New York Times Company, Gannett Company, Belo, and McClatchy are driving strong double-digit revenue gains thus far this year.</p>
        <p>Asked about the dangers of the Internet, William S. Morris III, chairman and chief executive of Morris Communications and the association's outgoing chairman, said in an interview: ''We can play that game ourselves. We've got reporters going out all over the place getting information. We've got incredible promotional power. We've got a fantastic relationship with our customers -- our advertisers.'' When asked about the swoon in the stock price of Internet companies, he deadpanned, ''Even Internet stocks have to have earnings.''</p>
        <p>So for much of the three-day convention, anxiety gave way and it was business as usual. Publishers asked  Al Gore and George W. Bush about the cross-ownership rule forbidding newspaper owners from owning television stations in the same markets.</p>
        <p>Remembering that the San Diego convention was the site of the Tribune Company's early feelers to buy Times Mirror, they closely watched who was having coffee with whom.</p>
        <p>Back to normal, however, also meant back-to-normal worries, like falling stock prices and readership and competition with direct-mail companies. The worries about the dragons, about terra incognita, however, were gone. The industry has been drawing itself new maps.</p>
