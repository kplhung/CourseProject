        <p>Two weeks before the final round of Peru's presidential election, international observers say they again have serious concerns that President Alberto K. Fujimori may be preparing to steal enough votes to ensure he wins a third term.</p>
        <p>A month ago Peru came close to turmoil as opposition candidates and election monitors accused the government of widespread vote tampering after a campaign marred by smear tactics and dirty tricks. A crisis was averted only when electoral authorities announced that Mr. Fujimori had fallen just short of an outright first-round victory.</p>
        <p>Now negotiations between the government and the opposition to improve election monitoring have collapsed over the government's refusal to replace poll watchers who reportedly took part in the tampering of ballots in the first vote.</p>
        <p>''There are disquieting signs that the scenario of the first round may be repeated,'' said Eduardo Stein, a former Guatemalan foreign minister who leads the Organization of American States election observation team. ''We don't know if there will be enough guarantees for a clean, transparent election.''</p>
        <p>The concerns are so grave that Alejandro Toledo, the business school professor who has staged a surprisingly strong challenge to Mr. Fujimori, is threatening to pull out of the race altogether rather than lend credibility to a process he characterizes as hopelessly flawed.</p>
        <p>Observers from the Organization of American States say the government has set such an early date for the runoff that there is not enough time to guarantee that the tabulation  will be any more reliable now than in the first round of voting on April 9.</p>
        <p>They say they continue to receive reports that army and government vehicles are being used to the advantage of the Fujimori campaign and that officials involved in handing out milk and cereals to poor mothers are mixing political propaganda with the food aid.</p>
        <p>Independent election observers say Mr. Fujimori's intelligence service appears to continue to orchestrate coverage of the campaign in several tabloid newspapers and a political magazine called Si, which have depicted Mr. Toledo as unstable, a liar and a tool of Alan Garcia, a former president who lives in exile to escape corruption charges.</p>
        <p>Photographs of Mr. Toledo in the magazine typically show him with a bottle or glass in his hand -- suggesting that the opposition candidate, who is a heavy water drinker, is imbibing something alcoholic. Several Si articles have reported sardonically that Johnny Walker is the challenger's principal adviser.</p>
        <p>The independence of the election apparatus remains in question. The senior officials who presided over the widely criticized first round remain in place. And a government investigation into evidence that the Fujimori campaign forged one million signatures to get him on the ballot has stalled, casting further doubt on the vote since any such forgery would have required the help of election officials.</p>
        <p>A few election officials have resigned and many more are expected to be implicated in the scandal -- but only after the vote on May 28 is tallied.</p>
        <p>Senior Peruvian government officials continue to commit themselves publicly to holding a clean election. Francisco Tudela, Mr. Fujimori's vice presidential running mate, told reporters this week, ''It is everyone's concern to create better conditions in the second round.''</p>
        <p>International election observers, however, say privately that they believe the government is manipulating them by agreeing to make changes that are more cosmetic than real.</p>
        <p>For instance, the government television network, which for months covered only the Fujimori campaign, broadcast parts of a Toledo rally for the first time this week. But only snippets of Mr. Toledo's speech were shown and camera shots focused on the outskirts of the crowd, giving the appearance that attendance at the rally was sparse.</p>
        <p>A report last week by the Atlanta-based Carter Center and the nonprofit National Democratic Institute, both of which have monitored numerous elections around the world, said that unless there were ''immediate and comprehensive improvements'' in the administrative and technical procedures of the runoff, ''Peru's election process will ultimately fail to meet minimal international standards for democratic elections.''</p>
        <p>The State Department issued a statement on Friday, saying, ''We join these observers in calling on the Government of Peru to remedy remaining deficiencies.'' It added that it shared concerns ''on the limited time remaining to effectively remedy these conditions.''</p>
        <p>Various opinion polls show the race between Mr. Fujimori and Mr. Toledo to be very close, and there is a good chance that Mr. Fujimori could win a majority of the vote without fraud.</p>
        <p>But the reports of new irregularities suggest that a Fujimori victory could be seriously tarnished even if cleanly won, igniting still more street demonstrations and diminishing the president's authority as he tries to fight drug trafficking and promote investment through his third five-year term.</p>
        <p>''If Fujimori wins, there still will be a crisis of credibility,'' said Rafael Roncagliolo, director of Transparencia, a Peruvian election monitoring group largely financed by the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>According to the official first-round count, Mr. Fujimori won 49.87 percent of the vote to Mr. Toledo's 40.24 percent. Recent polls show that a majority of Peruvians, including those who support Mr. Fujimori, believe there was fraud.</p>
        <p>The White House, which has embraced Mr. Fujimori's anti-drug and anti-terrorism efforts, could be put in the uncomfortable position of either choosing to support a tainted government or cutting back on cooperation that is in both countries' interests.</p>
        <p>The administration put heavy pressure on the Fujimori government to hold a runoff after international monitors reported during the first-round vote that ballots and tally sheets had disappeared and election computer centers had shut their doors without explanation for many hours at a time.</p>
        <p>Senior administration officials are again pressing for a clean election and expressing cautious optimism that it is still possible. They point to several modest signs of improvement, including an opening of some government-allied television stations. They also note that election officials appear to be moving toward giving Mr. Toledo's party access to software that will allow it to inspect the final computer vote count.</p>
        <p>Administration officials and independent monitors have praised election officials for agreeing to retrain poll watchers and refining the lines of command for officials responsible for transporting and counting the ballots and vote tally sheets.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Stein, the Organization of American States official who has emerged as the most influential independent election monitor, is still expressing serious reservations.</p>
        <p>In an interview this week, he said that it would take three weeks to test the computer software that the government is preparing to provide the opposition to watch the vote count. But with only two weeks to election day, the software still has not been made available for inspection.</p>
        <p>He also complained that the government had so far agreed to only one independent monitoring station capable of watching the transmission of voting data from 16 vote tabulation centers, leaving 40 tabulation centers uncovered.</p>
        <p>''It is possible that unauthorized people could transmit data or corrupt data without observers knowing it,'' Mr. Stein said.</p>
