        <p>For all of his 14 years in the State Senate, Guy J. Velella has had the distinction of being the only Republican elected official from the Bronx.</p>
        <p>And in those years, Mr. Velella, 55, has run for re-election facing relatively weak challenges from the Democratic Party in the Bronx and, in two elections, even securing that rival party's endorsement to appear on its line on the ballot.</p>
        <p>This year, however, his challenger is vowing to put up a fight. Mr. Velella is in what is expected to be a hotly contested race with Lorraine Coyle Koppell, a Democrat who is a lawyer and who is also the wife of a former state attorney general, G. Oliver Koppell.</p>
        <p>It is a race that is notable because it matches a longtime incumbent with an opponent who has significant name recognition in the Bronx, and because it could shake a comfortable alliance Mr. Velella has struck with Assemblyman Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx Democratic Party chairman.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Ramirez and Senator Velella say that although they have disagreed on many issues, they have a warm working relationship. Moreover, they contend that as a Republican in the Republican-controlled state Senate, Mr. Velella is able to secure financing for programs and services for the borough that his Democratic colleagues cannot.</p>
        <p>''We get along well,'' Senator Velella said of his relationship with Mr. Ramirez. ''And the Bronx should be in a position that, whoever is governor or mayor, the people of the Bronx benefit. With the way things are, Guy Velella or Roberto Ramirez can work together for the good of the Bronx.''</p>
        <p>But this warm relationship does not sway Mrs. Koppell, 53, who insists that many of Mr. Velella's positions are anathema to the Democratic Party and the district's voters.</p>
        <p>''If Guy Velella were a moderate Republican, I wouldn't take on this race,'' Mrs. Koppell said. ''But he isn't. He is against a woman's right to choose, even when the life of the mother is in jeopardy. He is out of step with this district.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Koppell also has supporters in the party. Foremost among them is State Senator Eric T. Schneiderman, who represents a district that includes the West Side of Manhattan and a section of the Bronx adjacent to Mr. Velella's district.</p>
        <p>''I am a strong supporter of Democrats who are running for office,'' said Senator Schneiderman, who is also chairman of the Senate Democratic Campaign. ''It's an overwhelmingly Democratic district and a moderate district. I think she has a good shot.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ramirez is more circumspect. ''I will consult with the leadership of the Bronx,'' he said of Mrs. Koppell's candidacy. ''We have always had a process in place and I will make decisions accordingly.''</p>
        <p>But several Bronx Democratic officials say Mr. Ramirez is angered by Mr. Schneiderman's intervention.  To many, it is a curious position for a leader who offered bitter recrimination to Democratic officials who crossed party lines to endorse Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani in 1997.</p>
        <p>Mr. Velella's hallmark in the district, apart from being the lone Republican, is his ability to get all manner of projects approved, from a new scoreboard for youth baseball teams to money for asthma centers in Bronx neighborhoods outside of his district.</p>
        <p>But Democrats have a 2-to-1 advantage in voter registration in the 34th Senate District. Moreover, the district, once largely Italian, has become more Hispanic and less conservative.</p>
        <p>Mr. Velella could face other difficulties. Investigators from the Manhattan District Attorney's office, armed with a search warrant, recently took a number of files from Mr. Velella's office in the Bronx. Barbara Thompson, a spokeswoman for the Manhattan district attorney, would not comment on the search. A spokesman for the senator said that staff members cooperated.</p>
        <p>The shape of the 34th State Senate District resembles a horseshoe, running from the Riverdale and Belmont sections of the Bronx into Westchester County and back into the east Bronx neighborhoods of Pelham Bay, Throgs Neck and Country Club.</p>
        <p>The race between Mr. Velella and Mrs. Koppell is likely to be expensive.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Koppell said she is deeply immersed in raising money and presenting voters with her stand on the issues. Mr. Velella is also gearing up for what even he acknowledges will be a more challenging race this time around.</p>
