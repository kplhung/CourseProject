        <p>They kept firing similar questions at Bobby Holik, phrased in all sorts of ways, the interrogative equivalent of slap shots and wrist shots that went high and low, to the stick side and to the glove side.</p>
        <p>How did it feel to score his first goal of any kind since March 24? And how did it feel to score his first playoff goal since the first round in 1997? Was he relieved to finally score? Is there less of a burden on him now because so many other Devils forwards can score?</p>
        <p>The unspoken implications were not so benign. They were: Why don't you score more, especially in playoff games? Weren't you overdue? Isn't it about time?</p>
        <p>Holik, a veteran of 10 National Hockey League seasons, understood all this, of course, and patiently answered everything. Unlike some of his teammates, he faces tough questions, win or lose, after every game. Why not field them today, even the edgy ones, with something good to celebrate?</p>
        <p>His goal, which gave the Devils a 3-1 lead over the Flyers, was not technically the game-winner. But it was the one that seemed to assure the outcome in what was to become a 4-1 Devils victory in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals. Game 2 of this four-of-seven-game series is here tomorrow night. The winner plays the Western winner for the Stanley Cup.</p>
        <p>''You're making too much of a big deal,'' Holik said, referring to the questions about his presumed joy over scoring. ''I mean, it's great to score again.'' But he added that it would have been just as satisfying for his linemates, Sergei Brylin and Randy McKay, to score, with Holik merely getting an assist. ''People might say, 'Oh, this guy sounds too good to be true,' '' Holik said. But he kept repeating that this was the way he felt.</p>
        <p>Any pressure, Holik said, would have come from within the team. And none did. ''Nobody in this organization came up to me in the past few weeks and said, 'Oh, you've got to do this or that,' '' he said. ''They were very encouraging because we've been doing very well.''</p>
        <p>In the first two rounds, four games against Florida and six games against Toronto, Holik said the role of his line was a little different. Perhaps it involved a little more checking and defensive play. Today, matched against Keith Primeau's line for many shifts, Holik and his wings lifted the Devils to an early lead. They set up Scott Niedermayer's goal in the first minute, with McKay and Brylin both getting the first of their two assists.</p>
        <p>After Petr Sykora gave the Devils a 2-1 lead at 17 minutes 38 seconds of the same period, Holik scored on the next shift to discourage both the Flyers and their fans. Holik gave credit to Brylin, who took a hit to make a play at the New Jersey blue line. He worked the puck to McKay, who got it back to Brylin, who sent it over, right to left, to Holik in the slot.</p>
        <p>''I was coming late,'' Holik said. ''I yelled and he found my sweet spot where all I had to do was one-time it on the net.''</p>
        <p>He is a big man, 6 feet 4 inches and 230 pounds, with short hair and a lilting voice and the accent of the Czech Republic. He is 29, having joined the National Hockey League with the Hartford Whalers in 1990. When Holik speaks, it is with a direct and steady gaze.</p>
        <p>Also scoring for the Devils was Claude Lemieux, who had only one goal in the previous 10 playoff games this spring. Like Holik, Lemieux is one of the big forwards who excel at checking. With offensive production now coming from four forward lines as well as defensemen so far in this tournament, the Devils are difficult to beat.</p>
        <p>In many ways, they played a classic road game, taking away the enthusiasm of the spectators early on. By midway through the third period, after Lemieux scored on the power play, there were plenty of empty seats in the First Union Center. Some spectators who remained chose to fight among themselves, drawing the biggest cheers of the third period. Among other Devils forwards playing well were Scott Gomez, the rookie center, and Alexander Mogilny, the veteran forward. Both moved the puck quickly and skated with purpose, making quick turns to find open space. On defense, Scott Stevens continued to crash into opponents. He led the Devils with six hits, four blocked shots and four takeaways. Vladimir Malakhov showed well again, adding an extra dimension and depth to the blue-line brigade.</p>
        <p>Although it is unwise to jump to too many conclusions after one playoff game, Holik and his mates were encouraged. They were a little stale after six days off and they still looked good. They might get better.</p>
        <p>''There are areas where we can improve,'' Holik said. ''There were flashes of our game where -- the first half of the third period -- they couldn't get out of their end. We want to play like that more often and frustrate teams. Not every game is perfect. For the first game of a series, we'll take this. We did a lot of things well.''</p>
