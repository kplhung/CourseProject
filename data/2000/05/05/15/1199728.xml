        <p>SITTING in his eighth-floor office as he prepared to deliver the commencement address at Howard University, William E. Kennard found himself torn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennard, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said he was simultaneously rejoicing and disappointed about the way things had changed for blacks since 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson used the commencement at Howard, a historically black school here, to deliver a landmark address on civil rights. What bothered Mr. Kennard most was the growing economic divisions among blacks themselves -- and the failure of the most well-off in times of prosperity to take care of those who remain behind.</p>

        <p>SITTING in his eighth-floor office as he prepared to deliver the commencement address at Howard University, William E. Kennard found himself torn.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennard, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, said he was simultaneously rejoicing and disappointed about the way things had changed for blacks since 1965, when President Lyndon B. Johnson used the commencement at Howard, a historically black school here, to deliver a landmark address on civil rights. What bothered Mr. Kennard most was the growing economic divisions among blacks themselves -- and the failure of the most well-off in times of prosperity to take care of those who remain behind.</p>
        <p>''There's cause for lots of celebration. African-Americans have made tremendous progress in 35 years,'' he said. ''But it's also sobering to think that by all objective indicators of success we are still disproportionately represented. And I get particularly frustrated because I think successful African-Americans focus too much time and attention on achieving more success and wealth at the upper ranks. Nothing diminishes our success more than to realize as a people we're still behind.''</p>
        <p>''Sure, we've made progress and some of the policies Johnson announced in that speech are responsible for that,'' he added. ''But at the same time, we have a long way to go.''</p>
        <p>The F.C.C. may seem an odd pulpit from which to be preaching social justice and racial equality, as Mr. Kennard, the agency's first African-American chairman, has been doing since he took the job nearly three years ago. It is a place, he said, where he and others typically spend their time ''refereeing fights between the rich and the very wealthy.''</p>
        <p>But then again, in the current technological and political climate, the F.C.C. is not such an unusual forum from which to advance change.</p>
        <p>At the vortex of a telecommunications revolution and a whirlwind of corporate deal-making that faces regulatory review, Mr. Kennard said he was ideally positioned to advance interests that some civil rights leaders say have caused a deep digital divide between the haves and have-nots, a gap that has been ignored by Congress and only belatedly recognized by the White House. With his agency buffeted daily by the competing interests of some of the nation's most powerful industries, Mr. Kennard views his mission as providing a voice to those who cannot hire a K Street lobbyist.</p>
        <p>''I believe one of the main civil rights challenges of this new millennium is the challenge of ensuring equal access to technology,'' he said. ''W. E. B. Du Bois said, 'The problem of the 20th century is the problem of the color line.' At the dawn of this century, our challenge is preventing the color line from determining who is online.''</p>
        <p>As such, Mr. Kennard has championed an unusually liberal agenda in a town controlled by a moderate White House and a Republican Congress. He has made political enemies by fighting for more money for a program to provide the Internet to schools and libraries, paid for through a tax on telephone bills. He has incurred widespread opposition from the nation's largest broadcasters for promoting a plan to approve hundreds of new low-power FM radio stations for churches, schools and community groups. And he has alienated telephone companies by blocking them from expanding into lucrative new markets while pressing them to provide service in less profitable underserved areas, including Indian reservations.</p>
        <p>''If you look across the nation, 94 percent of homes in America have telephones,'' he said. ''When you look at people living on tribal lands, the average drops below 50 percent. And in some areas, such as the Navajo nation, telephone service is down at 20 percent. We're not talking about Internet access, we're talking about basic phone service. In an era of wireless technology and satellite technology, that shouldn't exist.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennard's views are a byproduct of his upbringing. ''My parents had a sense that the way to raise children is by teaching them about the benefits they had enjoyed, and the importance of helping the disadvantaged,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He described his parents, a successful architect and a teacher of bilingual education, as ''first-generation middle class.'' One of his grandfathers was a Pullman porter and school janitor; the other was a chauffeur who later owned a restaurant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennard was 7 years old at the time of the Johnson speech at Howard, living in an integrated community in Los Angeles. His parents worked for the farm labor movement and against the Vietnam War. Before he left for college, he and his family helped run an orphanage in Mexico.</p>
        <p>After attending Stanford University, he briefly worked for an NBC television affiliate in California before entering Yale Law School. There he met his future wife, Deborah D. Kennedy, who recently left her job as a corporate lawyer at the Exxon Mobil Corporation and is now raising the couple's infant son, Robert, named after Mr. Kennard's father.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennard's oldest sister took over their father's architectural firm after he died a few years ago. Another sister runs the Los Angeles Airport Authority and, like Mr. Kennard, is a lawyer.</p>
        <p>AT the F.C.C., which he joined as general counsel in 1993, Mr. Kennard has occasionally been both amused and frustrated by the way some companies have reacted to his agenda. Some have retained black lobbyists and lawyers in a transparent attempt to curry favor. Others opposed to his regulatory regime have run to Congress and enlisted the support of Democratic and Republican lawmakers to rein in the agency.</p>
        <p>He said his greatest frustration was the inability of members of Congress even to consider the commission's policy recommendations.</p>
        <p>''I'm frustrated that oftentimes the debate focuses on winners and losers in terms of who will make money and lose money and not what I think is most important, which is how will something benefit the public,'' he said. ''And I'm frustrated that members of Congress often don't want to engage with me on policy but have made up their minds, often after hearing from big interests who are constituents.</p>
        <p>''When I got here I thought, maybe naively, that we could really grapple and engage on issues of policy. Some do, but most don't.''</p>
