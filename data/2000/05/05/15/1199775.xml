        <p>Editorial urges New York Gov George Pataki to reject alteration of state law proposed by Manhattan Dist Atty Robert Morgenthau that would protect works of art, on loan by nonresidents for exhibition in state institutions, from civil seizure but no longer from criminal seizure; says New York should not become forum for adjudicating global problem of stolen art works and disputed ownership (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>On Jan. 7, 1998, the Manhattan District Attorney, Robert Morgenthau, obtained a grand jury subpoena to prevent the return to an Austrian museum of two paintings by Egon Schiele that had been lent to the Museum of Modern Art for exhibition. Both paintings had been confiscated by the Nazis from their prewar Jewish owners, and heirs to those owners were seeking their return as stolen art. Late last year, however, the New York State Court of Appeals ruled 6 to 1 that Mr. Morgenthau's subpoena of the Schiele paintings violated an Arts and Cultural Affairs Law passed in 1968 specifically to prevent the seizure of works of art on loan by non-residents to exhibitions in New York State. The goal of this law was to encourage the worldwide lending of art for museum shows without the threat of confiscation. As Louis Lefkowitz, the attorney general at the time, expressed it, without such a statute ''incalculable harm may be done to the cultural institutions of this state.''</p>
        <p>After losing in the Court of Appeals, Mr. Morgenthau's office proposed an amendment to the statute to strengthen his authority. It adds the word ''civil,'' so that works of art lent by non-residents for exhibition in New York State would still be protected from civil seizure but no longer from criminal seizure. ''New York should not be a haven for stolen art,'' Mr. Morgenthau explained. The legislation amending the law has passed both houses and will soon arrive on Gov. George Pataki's desk.</p>

        <p>After losing in the Court of Appeals, Mr. Morgenthau's office proposed an amendment to the statute to strengthen his authority.

''New York should not be a haven for stolen art,'' Mr. Morgenthau explained. The legislation amending the law has passed both houses and will soon arrive on Gov. George Pataki's desk.</p>
        <p>Governor Pataki should firmly reject this attempted alteration in the law. New York State should not become the forum for adjudicating the global problem of stolen artworks and disputed ownership. A forum already exists at the United States Customs Service, which, in fact, began forfeiture hearings on one of the Schiele paintings after the Court of Appeals rejected Mr. Morgenthau's grand jury subpoena. The state law protecting art on loan to museums here from seizure has been in effect for more than 30 years. Far from turning New York into a haven for stolen art, it has helped make this city a vital center for the exhibition of art from around the world.</p>
