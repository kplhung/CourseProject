        <p>STERN-Priscilla Rudin. The congregation of Westchester Reform Temple mourns the death of Priscilla Rudin Stern, wife of our beloved Rabbi Emeritus, Jack Stern, Jr. With keen insight and abundant compassion, she cared for us as part of her extended family. Her poetry and prayers continue to inspire us, and her commitment to the highest ideals of Judaism have helped to shape and guide our Temple for decades. We send our love and condolences to Rabbi Jack Stern. Our hearts go out to Priscilla's children: Jonathan and Jamie, David and Nancy, Elsie and Steven; her grandchildren: Jacob, Nina, Lili and Benjamin; her brother and sister-in-law: Stephen and Gail Rudin; her stepmother: Lili Rudin; her stepbrother and sister-in-law: Jeffrey and Donna Laikind. Her father, of blessed memory, Rabbi Jacob Rudin prayed that ''when we die, there will be a light in our eyes worth someone's guarding, a heart worth someone's remembering, a mind worth recalling, a tongue whose wisdom death does not still.'' We cherish these gifts of Priscilla's, and so many more. Marjorie L. Miller, President Richard Jacobs, Rabbi Stephen Merkel, Cantor Kenneth Chasen, Rabbi Joseph Boardman Cantor Emeritus</p>
