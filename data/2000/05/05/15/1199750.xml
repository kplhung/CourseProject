        <p>Ethiopia said today that it had captured more ground in a third day of clashes with its neighbor, Eritrea, but Eritrean officials said the report was just propaganda aimed at voters in Ethiopia's nationwide elections today.</p>
        <p>The fighting along the nations' disputed border is a resumption of an exceptionally fierce two-year war. This evening, Ethiopian newscasts all but claimed victory on the westernmost front -- the area where the war started in May 1998.</p>
        <p>In a statement released tonight, Ethiopia said it had captured several more ''strategic'' towns, along with Eritrean troops and equipment. On Saturday, it said it had also destroyed eight divisions of Eritrean troops and bombed military targets at the town of Mendefera in Eritrea, only 30 miles from Asmara, the capital.</p>
        <p>But an adviser to Eritrea's president said that Ethiopia had exaggerated any gains and contended that in the first two days of fighting, which began on Friday, Eritrean troops had killed or injured 25,000 Ethiopians and many more today.</p>
        <p>''Today the Ethiopian losses are extremely high,'' said the adviser, Yemane Ghebremeskel. Such high numbers have been commonly reported in past flare-ups of fighting, though it has been impossible, as it was today, to verify the claims. Ethiopia did not specify any casualties inflicted on Eritrea except to say they were ''heavy.'' Neither side reported its own losses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ghebremeskel also ridiculed the stated intention of Ethiopia's prime minister, Meles Zenawi, to end the war quickly.</p>
        <p>''The dream that Meles has that he is going to have a short, neat war is a pipe dream,'' he said. ''He is sending tens of thousands of lives to their death for a conflict that cannot be resolved militarily.''</p>
        <p>The Ethiopian elections today were the nation's second set of general elections since the dictatorship of Mengistu Haile Meriam was overthrown in 1991. The governing party, the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front, was expected to retain power in Parliament.</p>
        <p>The voting was marred, however, by an opposition leader's charge that seven people were killed when government forces threw a grenade into one crowd of protesters and fired into another in the southern region of Hadiya. The Ethiopian government did not confirm that the attacks had taken place.</p>
        <p>On Monday, the United Nations Security Council is expected to meet to discuss possible sanctions if the two nations do not stop fighting --  and tonight there was no indication the battles would subside any time soon. Though the contested territory itself is relatively inconsequential, the fear among outside nations is largely over the potential loss of human life. In two years of sporadic fighting, at least 20,000 soldiers are estimated to have died.</p>
        <p>Though Ethiopian officials have not acknowledged it outright, the country appears to have begun an offensive on at least two of the three main fronts along the nations' unsettled, 620-mile border, apparently in the hope of a quick victory. Mr. Zenawi had told diplomats that he could no longer afford to keep the war going, especially since millions of Ethiopians are facing severe shortages of food.</p>
        <p>The two nations were close allies when Eritrea, once the northernmost province of Ethiopia, formally gained independence in 1993. But tensions between the nations exploded in May 1998, when Eritrea moved troops into the Badme region along the border.</p>
        <p>Eritrea contended that it was taking back its own land, according to colonial borders. Ethiopia in turn termed Eritrea's action an invasion and has since cast the war as a fight for its right of sovereignty.</p>
