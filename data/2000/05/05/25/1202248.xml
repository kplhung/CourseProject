        <p>There were no signs of torture on the deadpan face of Larry Bird, and the anti-Knick theme Reggie Miller hissed from beneath his floppy hat Monday seemed more theater than threat.</p>
        <p>There were no flashing red lights Tuesday night. No warning before Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals. The Knicks did not realize it when they casually arrived in town, but the Pacers had been hurting, too. Just not as dramatically as the Miami Heat.</p>
        <p>Beneath the Pacers' glib demeanor, there is a team of veterans every bit as desperate to gain redemption after losing to the Knicks in last year's conference finals as Pat Riley's angst-ridden troop was Sunday.</p>
        <p>''Their pain from losing last year fueled a great determined effort on their part,'' Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy said after practice today. ''Even though we talked about it many times, our players underestimated what it was going to take.''</p>
        <p>They were not prepared for what unfolded during their 102-88 loss in Game 1. Not entirely.  Miller's hide-and-seek with screens? Mark Jackson's efficiency? Jalen Rose's versatility? The Knicks knew what to expect from that threesome. Today, Larry Johnson, the lone Knick remaining on the practice floor, was trying to figure out just where Dale Davis came from.</p>
        <p>Davis, usually as offensively daring as a Victorian suit, revealed another side to his game. The 6-foot-11-inch Davis whipped out an uncanny string of turnaround jumpers over a bewildered 6-7 Johnson and left having outscored his Knick counterpart by 14-3, while outrebounding him by 16-5.</p>
        <p>''I thought Dale and them had me a little confused yesterday,'' said Johnson, who hit 1 of 5 shots. ''I didn't get as many touches as I wanted to. They had me thinking too much. Me, I'm better when I let it all go.''</p>
        <p>That is what he did so well a year ago. Johnson led the Knicks in scoring against the Pacers until he was injured in Game 6 of the conference finals. As the offensive go-to man in place of the injured Patrick Ewing, Johnson's series performance included a star-aligned 4-point play to end a 26-point night in Game  3.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday night, his only points came on a 3-pointer with nine minutes left in the second quarter. When it splashed into the net, he began to launch into his Big L routine as boos were mixed with some chuckles, too. After all, the Knicks were still down by 16 points.</p>
        <p>''He was struggling,'' Davis said of Johnson. ''It was probably a sign of relief.''</p>
        <p>A sly smile crossed Davis's face. For one night, he got the best of his friend. On the eve of Game 2 at Conseco Fieldhouse, Johnson was like a shadowboxer on the court today. For nearly 20 minutes after practice, he was spinning, ball-faking and slashing against an imaginary Davis. He was trying to find a rhythm against a player who had stunned him with his own steady beat in Game 1.</p>
        <p>''My man Dale, that turnaround jumper,'' Johnson said. ''I come into this series, and I've never seen Dale hit no turnaround jumper. He's put that in his game.''</p>
        <p>Davis's surprise offense jumped out at Johnson like a prank snake in a can. For the rest of the night, Johnson seemed shaken. As practice ended today, there was plenty of advice from Johnson's teammates on what he needed to do. Chris Childs said Johnson had to demand the ball. Latrell Sprewell suggested that Johnson should ''relax and attack.''</p>
        <p>For one of the few times since Johnson arrived in New York, he is asking for the ball. He did not feel that Davis shut him down as much as the Knicks' herky-jerky flow in Game 1 did.</p>
        <p>''I didn't get the ball enough to give them too much credit,'' Johnson said. ''How many shots did I take? Five.''</p>
        <p>That was two fewer attempts than Charlie Ward had and four fewer than Marcus Camby had. To create more shots for him, the Knicks intend to go to Johnson more in the low post, let him make Davis work harder and perhaps lure him into foul trouble. Another way to score is to rebound. The Knicks were outrebounded by the Pacers, 43-35.</p>
        <p>Davis led the way. He turned rebounds into dunks, and missed shots into opportunities. Johnson's inability to combat Davis's effort was just a microcosm of a night when the Knicks were not prepared for the kind of desire the Pacers exuded, right down to the most uncelebrated members of the team.</p>
        <p>''Davis is a great rebounder, and he was dominant last night,'' Van Gundy said. ''But it wasn't just on Larry. They outrebounded us by eight. The only weakness they have is supposedly rebounding. If their weakness is going to be a strength in this series or if we want to wait until Game 6 like we did in Miami to start rebounding, we will never get to Game 6 in this series.''</p>
        <p>Van Gundy's tone was foreboding. But the initial shock of Game 1 is behind the Knicks. The sight of Austin Croshere plopping in uncontested 3-pointers, the vision of Davis posting and turning on Johnson, jolted the Knicks into reality today. Now, the Knicks understand just how much the Pacers want this series: just as much as the Heat wanted the last one.</p>
        <p>''This Indiana team -- and I hate this cliche, mission -- but they have an unbelievable passion to get there,'' Van Gundy said. ''We do, too. We didn't show that last night.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>CHRIS CHILDS played only 12 minutes in Game 1 because of the flu. He said he felt better Wednesday. Over a 24-hour period, Childs said he drank about 10 bottles of water, slept off the symptoms and was ready to play in Game 2. . . . ALLAN HOUSTON said his sore ankle was healing well and did not believe it would hamper him Thursday night.</p>
