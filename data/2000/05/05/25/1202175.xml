        <p>Russia warned today that it might bomb targets in Afghanistan if the Islamic-led government there shelters and supports rebels fighting in Chechnya and former Soviet republics in Central Asia.</p>
        <p>The Russian foreign minister and defense minister each suggested today that airstrikes might be carried out if the Taliban, the fundamentalist group that leads the Afghan government, supports Islamic militants fighting in the former Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>''If a potential threat emerges, various actions become possible,'' Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov said when asked if Russia was contemplating airstrikes.</p>
        <p>There were no signs that military action was imminent, and some experts said that the Russians were engaging in saber rattling to press the Taliban to sever its links with Islamic militants in the former Soviet Union. Russian officials also insisted that the Kremlin was not planning a ground attack in Afghanistan, the site of a disastrous 10-year war between Soviet troops and Islamic guerrillas.</p>
        <p>Still, the Russian threat put the United States in a particularly uncomfortable position little more than a week before a summit meeting here between President Clinton and the Russian President, Vladimir V. Putin.</p>
        <p>Washington has urged the Kremlin not to broaden the conflict in the Caucasus or along its southern periphery by bombing Afghanistan. Still, it was the Clinton administration that launched a cruise missile attack in 1998 against suspected terrorist camps in Afghanistan following the bombings of the American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, one of the objects of the Clinton administration's attack -- the Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, whom Washington suspects of masterminding the embassy bombings -- is also a nemesis of Russia. Russian officials have charged that bin Laden and Islamic groups are providing weapons and other aid to Chechen rebels.</p>
        <p>''We agree that bin Laden is a threat to the region and beyond,'' a senior Clinton administration official said. ''But we believe the Russians should exercise restraint. We don't believe that anything is to be gained by spreading the Chechen war.''</p>
        <p>American experts say that there is some merit to the Russian complaint that the fighters in Chechnya include militants from the Middle East and South Asia and that foreign Islamic groups are also providing money and material support. But they assert that Russia is exaggerating the significance of the foreign assistance in order to portray its war in Chechnya as a struggle against an external threat rather than a battle against insurgent Chechens who are fighting for their independence.</p>
        <p>Chechnya is not the only Russian concern. Earlier this month, Mr. Putin suggested that Islamic rebels in Uzbekistan and other former Soviet republics in Central Asia were also receiving support from foreign sources.</p>
        <p>''We are ready to take preventative measures, if necessary,'' Mr. Putin said during a visit to Tashkent, the Uzbek capital. ''We are ready to take preventive measures, if necessary. Russia will certainly lend a hand to Uzbekistan.''</p>
        <p>The recent speculation about airstrikes was ignited by comments earlier this week by Sergei Yastrzhembsky, the Kremlin spokesman for the war in Chechnya. Mr. Yastrzhembsky's comments were assailed by Gennadi A. Zyuganov, the Communist party leader, who urged caution.</p>
        <p>''I am becoming increasingly convinced that people are getting into the Kremlin who are ready to wage war with anyone, starting with their own people and ending with neighboring states,'' Mr. Zyuganov said.</p>
