        <p>RICHARD MEIER, the world-renowned Pritzker Prize-winning architect, is promoting a glassy new condominium in Greenwich Village -- his first building in Manhattan in 30 years.</p>
        <p>''Where is there an apartment in New York City with four exposures and these views,'' he asked, gazing at a building model showing floor-through multimillion-dollar apartments. ''Uptown to the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building. Over there is Westbeth . . . ''</p>
        <p>Westbeth? Not perhaps a stop on every tourist's itinerary. But certainly a landmark for Mr. Meier. In the late 1960's, he transformed the old Bell Telephone Laboratories into low-cost rental housing and work space for artists, which in turn helped make the far west Village a community and the young Mr. Meier a celebrity.</p>
        <p>Back then, all of New York was about to lie at his feet.</p>
        <p>Except that it didn't. Although his office was in Manhattan, the telephone calls came from other places entirely.</p>
        <p>''Why hasn't anyone asked me?'' he said. ''I've lived and worked here all my life. I've designed buildings in Italy, Spain, France, Luxembourg, Holland. Look at New York City: bar none, the greatest city in the world.'' But in New York, he said, ''architecture is not high on the agenda.''</p>
        <p>He marched a visitor to a window in his sixth-floor office, with its sidelong view of 11th Avenue and the Hudson River. ''Look at that,'' he said, gesturing toward mundane, red-brick-banded apartment skyscrapers still under construction. ''That's what's being built now.''</p>
        <p>He paused. ''I look out the window, and it hurts me,'' he said. ''There is such constant change. There is no city in such extraordinary flux. What an opportunity! Another opportunity missed! It hurts.''</p>
        <p>Donald J. Trump has periodically talked about hiring Mr. Meier for one of his mega-projects. ''Yeah, he told me, too,'' Mr. Meier said. ''I'm still waiting.''</p>
        <p>But he is not waiting for Mr. Trump anymore. Mr. Meier is, in a sense, coming home.</p>
        <p>By the end of next year, he hopes to have overseen completion of a pair of 14-story condominiums, with 28 apartments in all, on one of the most coveted corners in town.</p>
        <p>Richard Born, Ira Drukier and Charles Blaichman, three relative unknowns in the rough world of New York real estate, are the main developers of the $50 million project, although Mr. Meier will own a piece of the pie (less than 10 percent, he said).</p>
        <p>Given two relatively narrow sites that flank Perry Street at West Street, Mr. Meier has designed gleaming white buildings with huge expanses of clear glass, punctuated by frosted-glass balconies. Although they are the same height, one is slimmer and consequently more delicate, to accommodate a narrower lot.</p>
        <p>Depending on the floor, the prices will range from $2 million to $8 million. The condominiums will be delivered with open, loftlike floor plans, but Mr. Meier flipped through blueprints to show more refined, partitioned spaces, saying buyers could hire his firm to finish them off.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meier, still selling, said there would  be amenities galore: a couple of concierges, a cafe on the ground floor of one building, parking in a building right behind, maybe even a health club. (An earlier plan for a hotel on top of the garage is in abeyance, and the future of a proposed restaurant, run by Jean-Georges Vongerichten in the cafe space, is uncertain, the architect said.)</p>
        <p>While designed to be glamorous, the buildings are far from Mr. Meier's biggest commission: he has done courthouses and museums. And, of course, there is the Getty Center in Los Angeles, 13 years in the making and finished just three years ago, a vast white complex of buildings high over the San Diego Freeway. Though controversial while it was being built, it has come to be regarded as the epitome of Meier style, a tourist attraction of the first order.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people wanted to put me on the shelf after the Getty,'' he said. ''Well, the Getty is great, but you move on.''</p>
        <p>Even during those 13 years, he said, there were other things going on: ''the city hall in the Hague, the Museum of Contemporary Art in Barcelona and a lot of other things.''</p>
        <p>Right now, his firm's most highly publicized project is probably the Church of the Year 2000 in Rome (which, the architect said wryly, he hopes will be finished by the end of the year 2000). And there is also a single-span bridge he has designed for Alessandria, Italy, to be started in the fall.</p>
        <p>And now, there are . . . the twin towers. Well, maybe not towers.</p>
        <p>''This is a tiny project,'' Mr. Meier said. ''Instead of 14 stories, I could be doing something 10 or 20 times bigger with the same amount of effort.''</p>
        <p>But at least it's a beginning, isn't it?</p>
        <p>''I would hope so,'' he said. ''It's a beginning of the next phase, a phase that will deal with urban issues.''</p>
        <p>On Perry Street, four- and five-story brick walk-ups abound, along with short, stubby warehouses. A few blocks north, Mr. Meier's first New York venture, Westbeth, is about the same height as the Perry Street buildings. But Mr. Meier's materials will be different: so polar white, so glossy.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the big developers were afraid to hire him, sure that they would get a ''Richard Meier'' signature building -- with white metallic-looking walls and glass grids -- which might or might not blend in.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meier nodded; he's heard it before. ''But contextuality doesn't mean it has to look like what's around it. The scale and materials can be appropriate, but it doesn't have to be a clone. That's why I think these new buildings are contextual. They may not match what's around -- thank goodness. They are more contextual than some pastiche.''</p>
        <p>The towers will be built ''as of right,'' which means that the developers don't have to ask the city for special zoning favors, so there is no official place in the process for neighborhood input.</p>
        <p>But even if the neighbors turn out to be  unhappy about the buildings' juxtaposition of white glass to faded red brick and gray cinder block -- their Meiericity, so to speak -- the buyers don't seem to be.</p>
        <p>''Half of the apartments are already spoken for,'' Mr. Meier said.</p>
