        <p>Julie Kent and Vladimir Malakhov in ''Swan Lake,'' Nina Ananiashvili and Angel Corella with Frederic Franklin in ''La Sylphide'' and a vibrant ensemble in ''Diversion of Angels'': add up these performances at American Ballet Theater and you don't have to wonder why the company's repertory is defined as eclectic.</p>
        <p>One of the bonuses of this deliberately wide range is the pleasure of discovering the singular within the diverse. The great Danish choreographer August Bournonville preserved the purity of the 19th-century French-Danish style and his 1836 version of ''La Sylphide'' is an exquisite signature piece. Returning to the repertory on Tuesday night with added vigor from the 85-year-old Mr. Franklin as Madge, the witch who sets the action into motion, ''La Sylphide'' remains the epitome of the Romantic ballet.</p>
        <p>The same bill at the Metropolitan Opera house opened with a modern-dance work that the company first danced at City Center last fall: Martha Graham's ode to love, ''Diversion of Angels,'' from 1948, set to Norman Dello Joio's score and staged here by Takako Osakawa. No one could call Graham a Romantic.</p>
        <p>The couples onstage who embody various aspects of love are abstractions of emotion, the equivalent of red, yellow and white colors on a canvas.</p>
        <p>In 1923 Graham saw a Kandinsky painting (''A slash of red upon a field of blue,'' she called it) and said, ''I will dance like that.'' She did, and the Ballet Theater ensemble has now caught the vitality of her essence.</p>
        <p>Within the century spanned by Bournonville and Graham, the 1895 ''Swan Lake'' of Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov, in Kevin McKenzie's new staging, stands at midpoint. It is a more familiar classic than ''La Sylphide,'' which is repeated tonight and returns on June 16 to 17. Erik Bruhn's 1964 staging for Ballet Theater differs somewhat from the Danish original in mime and costumes.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the theme of this ''Sylphide'' is clear. James, a Scottish farmer, abandons reality in search of an ideal, which proves to be an illusion. Ms. Ananiashvili, as the ideal, has a Bolshoi thrust and her feet are flexed in the leg beats that should look pointed and perfect. But she has charm and delicacy: her mime, as she seduces James in the woods and then dies in his arms, is touching and even heartbreaking.</p>
        <p>Desmond Heeley's misty forest hides a typically Romantic and troubling undercurrent. Mr. Corella's plight is wonderfully acted out. He is quick to anger, an intemperate man who easily leaves his bride to pursue the sylph. In Act II his sense of wonder registers on his face. The leg beats in the solos were not quite as tight as expected but he keeps to the Danish style, arms lowered, as does Joaquin De Luz, as James's rival.</p>
        <p>The mime roles were excellently performed. Rosalie O'Connor as Effie, the abandoned bride, expressed emotions boldly and dramatically. Mr. Franklin, the star of the Ballets Russes de Monte Carlo in the 1930's and 40's, received a roaring ovation from his fans. His witch was mean from the start, an arm-waving schemer who rose up with power to strike James down.</p>
        <p>On Monday Ms. Kent and Mr. Malakhov did well enough in ''Swan Lake,'' but this was not the world-class performance one had hoped to see. Mr. Malakhov's partnering in the ballroom scene had some glitches and his dancing lacked his usual assertiveness. Ms. Kent's Odette is marblelike in its beauty, needing more of the lyrical depth that the music urges. But her Odile has a diamond-sharp brilliance. Yes, she executed the fouettes.</p>
