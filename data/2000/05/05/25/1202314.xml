        <p>Yes, he does have the votes for his realignment plan, Commissioner Bud Selig said yesterday.</p>
        <p>After Selig postponed an owners meeting scheduled for June 13 and 14, a baseball lawyer said the commissioner did not have enough votes to adopt the plan that would move Arizona to the American League and Tampa Bay to the National League, among other elements.</p>
        <p>''I do have the votes,'' Selig said by telephone from his Milwaukee office. He postponed the meeting, he said, to explore other possible alignments and schedules before making a final decision.</p>
        <p>''I have only one real objective here, an unbalanced schedule,'' Selig said. ''I think this plan is the best way, but we'll look at others.''</p>
        <p>The players association has to approve any change in the league structures, and Selig acknowledged it would be a problem if the union rejected the prevailing plan.</p>
        <p>The chief opponents of the plan among owners appear to be some teams in the American League Central, which would have six teams compared with four in the league's other divisions, and the Cincinnati Reds, who don't like the idea of being in a Southeast Division with Atlanta, Tampa Bay and Florida.</p>
        <p>Selig indicated that the owners' meeting would be rescheduled for early July. A majority in each league is needed to approve a realignment plan.</p>
