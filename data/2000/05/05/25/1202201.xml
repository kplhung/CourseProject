        <p>The Giuliani administration is delaying the start of dozens of city construction projects while it waits for legislators in Albany to act on a request for an additional $4 billion in borrowing authority.</p>
        <p>The action comes as the city nears its $30 billion cap on how much it  may borrow, a state-mandated limit that Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker, say is based on an outdated, unnecessarily restrictive formula.</p>
        <p>''This is more than just important, it is absolutely critical to our ability to build schools, fix bridges, roads, parks and cultural institutions,'' said Adam L. Barsky, director of the mayor's Office of Management and Budget, speaking about the requests before the Legislature to increase the borrowing limit.</p>
        <p>The city has enough borrowing capacity left to continue with its planned construction projects until the end of this year. But because it is unsure if the Legislature will approve the extra $4 billion, the Giuliani administration has decided to halt new projects, with the exception of those necessitated by health and safety or required by law.</p>
        <p>More than 80 contracts worth a total of $76 million have already been  halted by the comptroller's office as a result of the mayor's freeze. The  projects include $2.4 million in repairs to boats of the Staten Island Ferry; $3.7 million for the reconstruction of East Tremont Avenue in the Bronx; and $7 million for the design and installation of an emissions testing station for city trash trucks, the comptroller's office said.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mr. Barsky said, the Giuliani administration extended the freeze to the school system, which intends to construct buildings with a total capacity of 58,000 students in the next four years; buildings with a capacity of 6,500 are already under way. Construction that has begun is not affected by the freeze.</p>
        <p>The city has asked the State Legislature to ease the city's debt problem  in two ways. First, it wants some temporary relief, in the form of permission to borrow the extra $4 billion, which would cover a $3.4 billion shortfall in debt capacity expected in  the next four years.</p>
        <p>It also wants the Legislature to start the process of amending the Constitution to revise the way the debt cap is set. Under the current system, the city may borrow no more than 10 percent of the average value of taxable property in the city  during the last five years. City officials want to increase the borrowing capacity by adding the personal income tax base to that sum.</p>
        <p>So far, state legislators have said  they do not intend to act this year on the request for a constitutional amendment. And there has been little movement on the request for the extra $4 billion.</p>
        <p>Comptroller Alan G. Hevesi has encouraged the Legislature to increase the debt limit by $1 billion a year for four years, a proposal that Mr. Vallone and Mr. Giuliani oppose.</p>
        <p>The freeze on projects is so new that it has not yet caused major problems, city officials said. At Lincoln Center, work is due this summer on a $6.4 million renovation of the reflecting pool on the center's north plaza and on a repair of expansion joints that at times allow water to leak into the complex. The contracts for the work are ready for approval, but action has been postponed.</p>
        <p>''I am hoping it is resolved quickly,'' said Andre R. Mirabelli, senior vice president of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts. ''This is very much work we need to do.''</p>
