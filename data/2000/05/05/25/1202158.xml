        <p>Now, during those boring conference calls, you can use your Palm organizer to do more than play Tetris. You can blast Wibble Bots.</p>
        <p>James McCombe, a programmer in Belfast, Northern Ireland, has created Dreadling, a first-person shooter contest that shrinks the action-game concept behind Id Software's Wolfenstein 3D and Doom down to size.</p>
        <p>Dreadling has textured 3-D graphics, and the Palm's standard five buttons are converted to the game's controls. The player can collect fresh ammunition, new weapons and health credits while facing monsters. The game will run on the Palm III and later models, and on Visor and I.B.M. WorkPad c3 organizers that run at least version 3.0 of the Palm operating system. A sample version can be downloaded free from www.dreadling.com, and the full version of the game costs $19.98.</p>
        <p>Since the average P.D.A. has only about two megabytes of RAM, Mr. McCombe had to make the file as small as possible. ''The shareware version of Dreadling requires only 80 kilobytes of memory and requires an extra 50 kilobytes or so when running, since it decompresses itself into available memory,'' he said in an e-mail message.  Mr. McCombe has created fairly speedy renderings of explosions and monsters for the Palm's small screen.</p>
        <p>''Games of this nature normally require large amounts of processing capability, memory and advanced graphics hardware,'' Mr. McCombe said. ''Your average computer screen has a game resolution of 800 by 600 pixels at least, and the Palm Pilot has only 160 by 160.''</p>
        <p>But as Dreadling proves, that is just enough to shoot down a few Grunt Bots before the next meeting.</p>
