        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Kathryn Shattuck's article ''Beware the Cry of 'Niyby': Not in Your Backyard!'' (May 11) failed to mention a new and pervasive backyard trend: unattended dogs.</p>
        <p>In my line of work (landscape architecture) I have helped defend clients hoping to add improvements and I have also aided people resisting new projects. I know how changes in a familiar environment can drive people crazy.</p>
        <p>Sound is part of the environment, a variable in its design. Regarding sound, I am a transcendentalist. I like quiet and have enjoyed it for most of the 25 years I have lived in my present neighborhood. Unfortunately, my neighborhood and most other areas I have visited recently have grown noisy with barking.</p>
        <p>I decided to act against this change to my environment after the barking spoiled one of the most beautiful springs I've seen. (The last straw was the woofing that went on while our future son-in-law was asking for my eldest daughter's hand.)</p>
        <p>The new dogs' owners, fortunately, are people we know, and I have been able to gain some quieting down (though not complete silence) from each of them. On weekends, the barking is as pervasive as bird song. I no longer enjoy gardening and have hired a contractor to do it for me.</p>
        <p>I am one of the ''order-loving mice'' alluded to in Ms. Shattuck's article. All I want is to be able, once again, to take an uninterrupted nap on a Saturday afternoon with the windows open.</p>
