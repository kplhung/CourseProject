        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Martin Feldstein's analysis of Gov. George W. Bush's proposal to allow people to invest part of their Social Security taxes in the stock market (''Bush's Low-Risk Pension Reforms,'' Op-Ed, May 22) assumes that the last 50 years of stock market performance form a statistical basis for predicting the future. In fact, the stock market has been able to grow as it has in part because of an increasing ratio of working people to nonworking people.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Martin Feldstein's analysis of Gov. George W. Bush's proposal to allow people to invest part of their Social Security taxes in the stock market (''Bush's Low-Risk Pension Reforms,'' Op-Ed, May 22) assumes that the last 50 years of stock market performance form a statistical basis for predicting the future. In fact, the stock market has been able to grow as it has in part because of an increasing ratio of working people to nonworking people.</p>
        <p>The real risk to Social Security is that this ratio will begin to shrink as baby boomers retire. Large amounts of retirees' money pursuing a shrinking amount of available goods and services could lead to a collapse of stock market prices and high levels of inflation.</p>
        <p>The government should search for ways to maintain economic growth during this period, which could include increasing the retirement age, increasing immigration, investing in productivity-increasing technology and encouraging investment in developing countries where population is still growing.</p>
