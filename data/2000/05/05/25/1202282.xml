        <p>A 12-year-old boy was shot in the chest and critically injured in Brooklyn yesterday as he and two friends played with a gun that they told the police they found in a vacant lot, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>It was not clear who fired the gun, said Detective Joseph Pentangelo, a police spokesman.</p>
        <p>The victim, Matthew Marino, was in critical but stable condition after undergoing surgery at Lutheran Medical Center last night, hospital officials said.</p>
        <p>According to the police, the three boys, all 12 or 13 years old, were building a skateboard ramp yesterday in a vast, rubble-strewn lot on 11th Street near Second Avenue in the Gowanus section.</p>
        <p>Around 5:20 p.m., one boy found a Lorcin 9-millimeter semiautomatic gun, the boys told the police. Minutes later, the police said, Matthew lay in the weeds and rocks, bleeding.</p>
        <p>''Whether it's self-inflicted, accidental or someone else shot him, none of that is worked out yet,'' Detective Pentangelo said.</p>
        <p>Matthew's friends ran out to Second Avenue, a bleak industrial strip shadowed by the elevated subway tracks and the Gowanus Expressway, and flagged down a pedestrian, who called 911, the detective said.</p>
        <p>Matthew lives on 11th Street a few hundred feet from the vacant lot, on a close-knit block of modest row houses. Neighbors said he and the other boys spent most afternoons skating, usually in Ennis Park, near Matthew's house.</p>
        <p>''They were skating here just this afternoon around 5,'' Lourdes Rivera, 25, said as she stood in Ennis Park. ''They're regulars.''</p>
        <p>Sanitation workers based in a depot near the lot said they saw the boys slip through the chained-off gate that leads to the lot around 4:30 p.m., dragging a wooden plank to build the ramp.</p>
