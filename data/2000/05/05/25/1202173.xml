        <p>Ellis Kohs, a composer known for works in which contemporary harmonic ideas were combined with the structural elegance of Classical forms, died at a nursing home in Los Angeles on May 17. He was 84.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kohs was born in Chicago on May 12, 1916, and grew up in San Francisco, where he undertook his early musical studies at the San Francisco Conservatory. When his family moved to New York in 1928, he entered the Institute of Musical Art. He continued his studies at the University of Chicago, where he was a composition student of Carl Bricken. After he completed his master's degree there in 1938, he returned to New York and enrolled at the Juilliard School, where he studied composition with Bernard Wagenaar. He also studied composition with Walter Piston and musicology with Willi Apel and Hugo Leichtentritt at Harvard University.</p>
        <p>During World War II, Mr. Kohs conducted the Army and Air Force bands at Fort Benning, Ga.; St. Joseph, Mo.; and Nashville. He also wrote one of his more humorous works during his army service, ''The Automatic Pistol,'' in which he set the text of an Army weapons manual for a male a cappella choir.</p>
        <p>When he returned to civilian life, he joined the faculty of Wesleyan University, where he taught composition from 1946 to 1948, and the Kansas City Conservatory, where he taught during the summers of 1946 and 1947. In 1948 he moved to California and undertook teaching positions at the College of the Pacific and at Stanford University. He began teaching at the University of Southern California in 1950, and remained on the faculty for 38 years, during which he was chairman of its music theory department for several years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kohs's stage works include an opera, ''Amerika'' (1969), after Kafka's novel, ''Lohiau and Hiiaka,'' a choreographed setting of a Hawaiian legend, and incidental music for Shakespeare's ''Macbeth'' (1947). Among his orchestral scores were a Concerto for Orchestra (1942), a Cello Concerto (1947), a Violin Concerto (1980) and two Symphonies (1950 and 1957). His vocal works included settings of Navajo songs and ''The Lord Ascendant,'' based on ''The Epic of Gilgamesh.'' He was also a prolific composer of chamber and keyboard works.</p>
        <p>He was the author of several music theory textbooks, including ''Music Theory, a Syllabus for Teacher and Student'' (1961), ''Musical Form: Studies in Analysis and Synthesis'' (1976) and ''Musical Composition: Projects in Ways and Means'' (1980).</p>
        <p>No immediate family members survive.</p>
