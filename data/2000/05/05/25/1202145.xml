        <p>When the film festival here features as many major directors taking their work in new directions as this year's did, that's notable.</p>
        <p>The collection included a soulful action film by the master of comedy of manners, Ang Lee, ''Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,'' which featured Chow Yun Fat brimming with physical grace and was held together by an ethereal calm as its battlers soared through the air. There was ''Nurse Betty,'' a comedy with a warm touch by the director-provocateur Neil LaBute.</p>
        <p>And there were movies from three major filmmakers that tried to expand the horizons of the musical: Lars Von Trier's ''Dancer in the Dark,'' Wong Kar-wei's ''In the Mood for Love'' and Joel and Ethan Coen's ''Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou?'' Two of those musical departures, ''Dancer'' and ''Mood,' received major recognition from the jury at the festival, which ended on Sunday.</p>
        <p>''Dancer,'' which won the Palme d'Or and the best actress award for its star, Bjork, in her acting debut, is a melodrama with musical elements. For Mr. Von Trier, trying something new did not seem to cause the slightest furrow in his brow.</p>
        <p>''I'm completely sure I'm doing wonderful things,'' he said, a nervous smile playing around the corners of his mouth. ''That's because my mother always said I was doing wonderful things. Even Napoleon's mother said: 'No, no. You're tall!' ''</p>
        <p>It is the first time that Mr. Von Trier has used musical scenes in a film, and he disturbed some conventions of the form. Except for the musical numbers that erupt from the imagination of Bjork's character, the film has no music, not even an underscore. Such music irritates him, he said, calling it cheap manipulation. ''I'm cheating people in smarter ways,'' he added.</p>
        <p>''Dancer'' had its first public showing here, and the movie, in which Bjork plays Selma, a woman slowly going blind and working several shifts to raise money for an operation that can save her son's sight, left some in the audience sobbing. The film has plot gambits that would have seemed shameless even in the silent era. Selma is the lead in her small town's production of  ''The Sound of Music'' -- it's one of the few things that keeps her going -- and she stars in big musical numbers in her imagination.</p>
        <p>This could be Mr. Von Trier's ''Pennies From Heaven,'' the BBC series by Dennis Potter in which full-scale musical numbers exploded in the characters' minds as a way of relieving the gloom of their existence. But Mr. Von Trier said: ''I wasn't fond of 'Pennies.' I don't like making fun of genres, which maybe he was.''</p>
        <p>In Selma, ''Dancer'' carries on the tradition of the suffering female protagonist. ''She loves Technicolor musicals and human beings with flaws,'' Mr. Von Trier said. The decisions she makes send her spiraling into tragedy. ''From a logical point of view, the women have a choice,'' he added. ''From their point of view, they don't have a choice. It's a very romantic thing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Von Trier may have found his battles with Bjork neither romantic nor logical. She submerged herself so deeply into the character that she seemed to feel he was her torturer. The director said he had feared that the strains would wreck his career and his marriage. As a line goes in a song she sang with her old band, the Sugarcubes: ''This wasn't supposed to happen.''</p>
        <p>Bjork is evidently as controlling and stubborn as he is, though in ''Dancer'' she chose to play a character with no control, one whose life contrasts with her own powerful and affirming pop music. Perhaps the most striking thing about her speaking voice is how similar it is to her singing.</p>
        <p>The picture introduces Selma and others rehearsing ''My Favorite Things.'' It's a moving, rough-hewn opening that will feel like a new Bjork demo to her fans. To the uninitiated it will be a riveting insight into Selma's fervor. Mr. Von Trier has an instinct for drawing audiences into his work.</p>
        <p>No Monologues</p>
        <p>For Mr. LaBute the Cannes festival provided a rare chance to present a film that he hadn't written. ''Nurse Betty,'' received the writing award for its script, by John C. Richards. ''I read it and thought it was more charming than anything I'd write,'' the director said.</p>
        <p>''Betty'' is a road comedy starring Renee Zellweger as a traumatized woman who believes she's a character from her favorite soap opera and who heads west to meet the show's star (Greg Kinnear) while being followed by a pair of hit men (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock). ''This movie has the first girl character in one of my movies who's not a victim, and maybe that's because I didn't write it,'' Mr. LaBute continued. ''I liked that aspect and didn't want to muddy the waters by getting my hands in it.''</p>
        <p>This film has a thematic similarity to Mr. LaBute's ''In the Company of Men'' and ''Your Friends and Neighbors,'' in that the protagonist is looking to change her life and intent on finding what she needs.</p>
        <p>''It's true, everyone is searching for an ideal in this one,'' he said. ''It's something I see in myself.''</p>
        <p>Mr. LaBute said he was intrigued by the script because the central character, Betty, was an innocent who survived because of her purity, embodied by Ms. Zellweger.</p>
        <p>''The movie really is so much Renee,'' he said. ''I know it's a cliche, but that is who she is. But it's also so much Morgan, who tests you, and in the best way, I think. He doesn't suffer fools, and I don't either.''</p>
        <p>Mr. LaBute said he had felt he needed to take on someone else's material for a change. ''Directing a script I didn't write is less emotional and more analytical for me,'' he added. ''I was much more able to look at it and see what worked. There are no monologues in this movie, and I'm known for that in my work. I checked that impulse and cut scenes that had them. I like movies that push buttons, and ''Nurse Betty'' will push a set of different ones: 'Is he a sell-out?' Oh, it's nice. Maybe I was wrong about him.' ''</p>
        <p>A New Grammar</p>
        <p>''Betty'' wasn't the only likable and noteworthy comedy here. The director Roy Andersson's stylized, eccentric and funny ''Songs From the Second Floor'' won one of two Jury Prizes. This deadpan comedy is built around beautifully composed frames captured by a stationary camera; it's a series of bleak but comic vignettes about faith and alienation that might have been conceived by Gary Larson, creator of the ''Far Side'' newspaper cartoons.</p>
        <p>Not all of the major moments at the festival came from directors' engaging in sudden twists and turns. There were a number of noteworthy Iranian films, including ''Blackboard,'' which won the other Jury Prize. This drama with flickers of comedy and startling flashes of violence is the work of a young director, Samira Makhmalbaf.</p>
        <p>There were several impressive sophomore efforts: ''Requiem for a Dream,'' adapted from Hubert Selby Jr.'s novel by Darren Aronofsky, and ''The Yards,'' directed by James Gray with a stately moodiness and a socialist punch right out of Visconti.</p>
        <p>And there was ''In the Mood for Love,'' the director Wong Kar-wai's gorgeous romantic drama, which won the best actor prize for its star, Tony Leung. Mr. Wong thinks with a camera and with each film seems to be inventing a new grammar for the medium. No one can cut within a scene the way he can, using edits to express shifts in feeling.</p>
        <p>Cannes had such an intriguing range of films that, by the final night, when the awards were handed out, there was no consensus about the Palme d'Or. People were divided between ''Dancer,'' which won the prize, and ''In the Mood for Love.'' Both films were highly anticipated and made the biggest impact here. Both, not incidentally, wrung new twists from the use of music to delineate the melancholy of the characters.</p>
        <p>The festival was proof that a director's vision can resuscitate any genre. Already the buzz is that westerns will be the next to be rescued, but let's not get ahead of ourselves.</p>
        <p>CANNES JOURNAL  Correction:  May 29, 2000, Monday  A Cannes Journal article on Thursday about noteworthy films at the International Film Festival omitted the identity of one co-writer of ''Nurse Betty,'' which won the award for best screenplay. The writer, with John C. Richards, was James Flamberg.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 13, 2000, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, an obituary of the actor Francis Lederer on May 25 referred imprecisely to the creators of the 1939 film ''Midnight,'' in which he was featured. It was directed by Mitchell Leisen and written by Billy Wilder and Charles Brackett; Mr. Wilder was neither the director nor the sole screenwriter.</p>
