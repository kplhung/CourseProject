        <p>Independent bookstore. Say it, and the words conjure up a dusty place with a tumble of books, an owner with a passion and a small staff with a love of literature and an uncommon knowledge of it, at times even a snobbishness about what is considered good enough to be displayed in the window, which of course fronts on a tree-lined Main Street.</p>
        <p>Is this romance in book publishing over? Not quite, but at a moment when there is a lot of continuing and justifiable anxiousness over small, independent general bookstores' being sucked down one at a time in the whirlpool of the large chains, it would seem quixotic, if not outlandish, to get into the independent bookstore business.</p>
        <p>For instance, in 1995 the American Booksellers Association, the trade group of the independents and the small chains, had more than 5,500 members with about 7,000 stores; now it has 3,100 members and 4,000 locations. Mostly the disappearing stores have been X'd out by the arrival in the neighborhood of a Barnes &amp; Noble or Borders store. (The sale of books on the Internet hasn't helped either.)</p>
        <p>But nonetheless Peter Greeman, 68, a retired advertising executive, has bucked the trend -- in a sort of bookish equivalent of ''man bites dog'' report -- and purchased a barely surviving independent in the Westchester County suburb of Larchmont. And while he doesn't see this as an act of intellectual expiation -- ''it's almost like a charity,'' he said -- he is pleased with what he has done, and so, too, are his neighbors. So just why has he leaped onto eroding terrain and bought Anderson's Book Shop?</p>
        <p>''I have a place in my heart for this particular bookstore,'' Mr. Greeman said. ''I grew up in Larchmont, and so did my father, and the bookstore was there, and Mr. Anderson wrote my college recommendation. I wanted to do Larchmont a favor. All my friends and acquaintances bemoaned the fact that they thought it would go under, and the store's manager,'' Annabelle Siegel, ''lives across the street from me, and she's a dear friend.''</p>
        <p>If the book business is full of people cradled in the arms of Morpheus, Mr. Greeman is confident he is not one of them. This new entrepreneur said that that the man he purchased his store from, Jim Miller, had owned it for 10 years and that it wasn't bankrupt. Mr. Greeman added: ''Jim was making a living but didn't have much to invest in the future. Maybe he thought there wasn't any future to invest in in this business. I said to myself there can be exceptions, particularly in a town like Larchmont where people like to shop locally.'' Mr. Greeman said he planned to renovate the store and increase its inventory from the 15,000 titles it has now to the 40,000 it had during its best years, a good percentage of the accretion to be in children's books. And there won't be a coffee shop in his store.</p>
        <p>Whether or not this works commercially in the Darwinian world, the salvaging of Anderson's Book Shop, although it is but one, is celebrated by book publishers. Independent bookstores still have an importance beyond the actual number of titles they sell. The best marketing for books remains word-of-mouth passion, and often the first mouths to send the word with fervor are the independent bookstores, particularly for literary fiction and literary nonfiction.</p>
        <p>Independent bookstores ''are littered with people like Mr. Greeman who have made them a second career,'' said Oren Teicher, the C.E.O. of the booksellers' association. ''They share a passion for their product, which sets them apart from people who own drugstores and hardware stores. They are teachers and librarians and bankers.''</p>
        <p>Ruth Liebmann, director of independent bookselling for Random House, explained: ''The indies are where lots of books start. They're actively looking for books to fall in love with, and they share that passion with their customers. They are tremendous readers, and they can generate a lot of talk in the life of a book, early on.''</p>
        <p>An example: Three weeks ago her department sent out several hundred reading copies to independent bookstores of ''Driving Mr. Albert'' (Dial Press), the true story by Michael Paterniti of the transporting of Albert Einstein's brain in two Tupperware containers in the trunk of a car from Princeton to California in the 1990's. ''Within four days it was read, and e-mails were flying around the country, and suddenly there there was huge excitement about a book nobody had heard of four weeks ago,'' Ms. Liebmann said. ''That chemistry can get a book started.''</p>
        <p>The book is scheduled to be in stores in July with a first printing of 25,000 copies. It has already been sold to the movies.</p>
        <p>The independents are involved in their own sort of jihad against the large chains and have a court case pending in California in which they charge the chains with making special promotional allowances and other deals with publishers. This allows the large chains to reduce their costs.</p>
        <p>''It's axiomatic that this will drive small stores out of business,'' Mr. Teicher said. Still, the association has made a settlement with the publishers, all of whom now claim that the playing field for independents and small chains has been leveled.</p>
        <p>Are things looking up for the independents? Perhaps. Their association, which is holding its annual convention in Chicago next month, reinstated at its last gathering its classes for people who want to learn how to operate an independent bookstore. This year 45 people have signed up for the course.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greeman said he was confident that there was no commercial space in Larchmont for a large chain branch, and that at any rate the population (6,200 in the 1990 census) was too small.</p>
        <p>But across Westchester County from his store there is the Mount Kisco Book Company in Mount Kisco, population 9,100. It was not just a store that sold books and such but also a community gathering place so popular that local residents banded together to bring it back from a fire four years ago. A two-minute walk away is a shopping center and a Borders. The Mount Kisco Book Company will close on Saturday.</p>
