        <p>Pearl Lang Dance Theater</p>
        <p>Kaye Playhouse</p>
        <p>It was fitting that the centennial salute to Aaron Copland at Kaye Playhouse began on Friday night with a program by the Pearl Lang Dance Theater. Copland created scores for classics like Martha Graham's ''Appalachian Spring'' and Agnes de Mille's ''Rodeo.'' Doris Humphrey's ''Day on Earth'' was set to his music. And Ms. Lang has been an eloquent commentator on Copland's music. ''Above all,'' she wrote in an 80th-birthday tribute to the composer, ''we thank him for the wonder of that defiant innocence and affirmation that sings in his music about America.''</p>
        <p>Copland believed in simplicity. The two most compelling pieces in Ms. Lang's tribute were the simplest. Her new ''Dance Panel No. 7,'' set to an excerpt from Copland's ''Dance Panels,'' is a little jewel that breathes and blooms gently with music whose measured shift from opening fanfare to calm suggests the brightening of morning light.</p>

        <p>It was fitting that the centennial salute to Aaron Copland at Kaye Playhouse began on Friday night with a program by the Pearl Lang Dance Theater. Copland created scores for classics like Martha Graham's ''Appalachian Spring'' and Agnes de Mille's ''Rodeo.'' Doris Humphrey's ''Day on Earth'' was set to his music. And Ms. Lang has been an eloquent commentator on Copland's music. ''Above all,'' she wrote in an 80th-birthday tribute to the composer, ''we thank him for the wonder of that defiant innocence and affirmation that sings in his music about America.''</p>
        <p>Copland believed in simplicity. The two most compelling pieces in Ms. Lang's tribute were the simplest. Her new ''Dance Panel No. 7,'' set to an excerpt from Copland's ''Dance Panels,'' is a little jewel that breathes and blooms gently with music whose measured shift from opening fanfare to calm suggests the brightening of morning light.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lang flings her six dancers onto the stage, their limbs opening wide as they move through churning patterns. The growing serenity of the music is captured in gentle rocking for the dancers and in a slow, soft bowing as the lights dim at the end. Nothing is forced, in dance and dancers that are at every moment urgently alive.</p>
        <p>One of the great pleasures of Ms. Lang's current work is the strength and resiliency of her beautifully trained dancers. ''Dance Panel No. 7'' was performed by Jennifer Binford, Kelly Hamilton, Tamar Even-Kesef, Adam Klotz, Chi-Tsung Kuo and Ari Mayzick, a dancer of extra focus and daring.</p>
        <p>In Ms. Lang's 1975 ''Prairie Steps,'' lyricism builds to turbulence, in the first section and ends in an exhilarating modern-dance hoedown. Copland's Sonata for Violin and Piano was performed by Colin Jacobsen and Eric Heubner.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lang was weakest in narrative choreography like the second section of ''Prairie Steps,'' a quiet Memorial Day mourning quartet (Ms. Binford, Kevin Predmore, Echo Gustafson and Khalila Young), and her new ''Cityscape.'' And Ms. Lang's oddly pretty new ''Icarus,'' performed to music by Sofia Gubaidulina, is diluted by its use of four suns. The program also included Ms. Lang's powerful ''Song of Azerbaijan.''</p>
