        <p>A Chilean appeals court has stripped the immunity of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, removing an important obstacle in the way of his possible trial on charges that he was involved in the kidnapping, murder and torture of thousands during his 17 years as Chile's dictator.</p>
        <p>The decision of the Court of Appeals is subject to a possible reversal by the Supreme Court, and even lawyers working to prosecute General Pinochet say it could take years of legal wrangling before a trial can begin, and that is assuming that the general, now 84, lives that long. He has circulatory problems and has a history of strokes and diabetes.</p>
