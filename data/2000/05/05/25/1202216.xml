        <p>The chief state prosecutor of Maryland  decided today to drop criminal wiretap charges against Linda R. Tripp, the Pentagon employee whose secretly recorded conversations with Monica S. Lewinsky exposed an affair that led to President Clinton's impeachment.</p>

        <p>The chief state prosecutor of Maryland  decided today to drop criminal wiretap charges against Linda R. Tripp, the Pentagon employee whose secretly recorded conversations with Monica S. Lewinsky exposed an affair that led to President Clinton's impeachment.</p>
        <p>The prosecutor, Stephen F. Montanarelli, said it would be impossible to successfully pursue a trial, which was to begin on July 10, because a judge this month suppressed testimony by Ms. Lewinsky that, Mr. Montanarelli said, was crucial to obtaining a conviction.</p>
        <p>The decision concludes the only criminal case against a major figure in the most serious Oval Office scandal since Watergate. Mrs. Tripp had faced the possibility of a 10-year prison sentence and a $10,000 fine.</p>
        <p>''I had no choice'' but to drop the case, Mr. Montanarelli said in an interview today, noting that in Maryland, a judge's ruling on suppression of evidence cannot be appealed to a higher court. ''I'm not pleased, but that's the life of a prosecutor.''</p>
        <p>In a statement posted on her Web site this afternoon, Mrs. Tripp called the Maryland case an example of ''selective prosecution,'' and vowed to ''continue to fight the shameful smear tactics of this corrupt administration in civil court.'' Last year she sued the White House and the Defense Department, saying they had used her confidential personnel records to impugn her reputation.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Tripp did not attend a news conference held today by her lawyer, Joseph Murtha, on the courthouse steps in Ellicott City, the Baltimore suburb where the trial would have been held.</p>
        <p>''We firmly believe that Mrs. Tripp did nothing wrong,'' Mr. Murtha said, ''and that she did not violate any laws when she exposed the criminal behavior and wrongdoing committed by President Clinton and others.''</p>
        <p>Laws on taping telephone calls vary from state to state. In Maryland, where Mrs. Tripp lives, it is against the law for one party to tape a phone conversation without the consent of the other. At a preliminary hearing in the case, Ms. Lewinsky testified that she had not given permission for any taping of her conversations with Mrs. Tripp, who was once her closest confidante.</p>
        <p>Mr. Montanarelli's decision to drop the charges was widely expected after the judge presiding over the case, Diane O. Leasure of Howard County Circuit Court, suppressed the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky in a decision issued on May 5.</p>
        <p>The prosecutor's office had faced the task of building a case against Mrs. Tripp that did not rely on evidence she gave to Kenneth W. Starr, then the Whitewater independent counsel, while she was under a federal grant of immunity.</p>
        <p>Central to the case was a Lewinsky-Tripp conversation that Mrs. Tripp taped on Dec. 22, 1997. This was the last talk between the two women that Mrs. Tripp recorded, and it occurred, prosecutors said, just after her lawyer had informed her that secret tape-recording was illegal in Maryland.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lewinsky testified last winter that she was certain this conversation had in fact occurred on that December day two and a half years ago.</p>
        <p>But Judge Leasure's decision held that the testimony was not credible and was tainted by the Starr investigation. Ms. Lewinsky's recollection of the date of the conversation, the judge said, was influenced by her contact with the independent counsel's office.</p>
        <p>''We believe her, the court does not, and that resolves the matter,'' Mr. Montanarelli said today of Ms. Lewinsky's testimony that she had an independent recollection of the date.</p>
        <p>''There are no other witnesses to the conversation whom the state can call to testify,'' the prosecutor said, ''and Tripp cannot be compelled to testify.''</p>
        <p>In their conversation of Dec. 22,  the two women discussed what they should say about Ms. Lewinsky's sexual relationship with the president in the testimony that each expected to give in a sexual misconduct suit filed by Paula Corbin Jones, a former Arkansas state employee, against Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''This was an extremely important and memorable event in her life,'' Mr. Montanarelli said of Ms. Lewinsky today, ''which was, shortly after it occurred, published in detail in the national news media.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Tripp was also charged with illegally disclosing the details of her conversation with Ms. Lewinsky to Newsweek magazine, which published a transcript of the talk in its issue of Feb. 2, 1998. Maryland is dropping those charges as well.</p>
