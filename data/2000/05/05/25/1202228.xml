        <p>The Senate voted today to confirm the nomination of Bradley A. Smith to the Federal Election Commission, although Mr. Smith, the Republican nominee for the agency, has angered Democrats by advocating a repeal of campaign finance laws.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith was confirmed by a vote of 64 to 35, after Republican and Democratic leaders, who squabbled for months over this nomination and others, brokered an agreement earlier this week. Democrats had objected to Mr. Smith's nomination, and Republicans had opposed a number of President Clinton's nominees to the federal bench. Both sides compromised, and a swap ensued.</p>
        <p>Among the 16 federal judges who were confirmed as part of the Senate agreement was Gerard Lynch, a Brooklyn-born former prosecutor who was nominated by President Clinton for a seat on the Federal District Court in Manhattan. Mr. Lynch, a Columbia University law professor, is an expert on federal anti-racketeering laws. He was confirmed by a vote of 63 to 36.</p>
        <p>With the logjam broken, the Senate also moved today to reconfirm Danny Lee McDonald, who already sits on the Federal Election Commission, and to confirm 46 other nominees for federal posts. Although 16 judges were approved, 36 other nominations are awaiting action in the Senate Judiciary Committee, a delay that has frustrated Democrats.</p>
        <p>But it was Mr. Smith's nomination that stirred the most acrimony, with the majority of Democrats and a few Republicans objecting to the selection. Campaign finance watchdog groups lobbied heavily against Mr. Smith. In fact, the nomination was so bitterly contested, it drew a Senate roll-call vote, which is unusual for election commission nominees.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith ''believes that all campaign contributions, spending and influence peddling are protected without limitation,'' said Senator Russell D. Feingold, a Wisconsin Democrat who helped write legislation to overhaul the campaign finance system. ''He has advocated time and again the repeal of the very law he would be sworn to uphold and enforce. How can we seriously consider confirming his nomination to serve as a commission?''</p>
        <p>The commission is made up of six members, three Democrats and three Republicans, a delicate and deliberate balance that is intended to avoid giving any one party an electoral advantage. This prerogative is the reason Democrats gave for voting for Mr. Smith.</p>
        <p>While the president nominates a  candidate, Congress must approve the nominee. In this instance, President Clinton agreed to nominate Mr. Smith in exchange for a vote on Richard C. Holbrooke, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, whose confirmation had been stalled by Republican senators, a Senate Democrat said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith, a law professor at Capital University in Ohio, has written extensively on campaign finance in scholarly journals and newspapers, and concludes that the way to mend the nation's campaign finance system is to get rid of the Federal Elections Campaign Act, which restricts the flow of money in political races while complying with constitutional free-speech protections.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith has argued that campaign finance laws approved by Congress after Watergate have failed; in fact, more money is required to run for office today, incumbents are more entrenched than ever and voter participation is at a low point.</p>
        <p>On this, both Mr. Smith and his detractors agree. But they disagree over the remedy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith says the $1,000 limit on campaign donations should be eliminated, arguing that challengers must be free to raise more money than incumbents to defeat them.</p>
        <p>He has also argued that money does not necessarily influence lawmakers. Instead, he says, it is the lawmakers' constituency, ideology and party affiliation that decide their votes.</p>
        <p>Most Republicans defended Mr. Smith today, calling his positions ''well-grounded in mainstream First Amendment doctrines and case law,'' as Senator Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, put it.</p>
        <p>But Senator John McCain, an Arizona Republican who wrote the campaign bill with Mr. Feingold, vehemently opposed the selection.</p>
        <p>''Sending Brad Smith to the F.E.C. is akin to confirming a conscientious objector to be secretary of defense,'' Mr. McCain said.</p>
        <p>And he chastised Mr. Clinton for going along with the nomination.</p>
        <p>''The president still had the ability and the authority to reject this most extreme nominee for any position that I have seen in my years here since 1987,'' Mr. McCain said.</p>
