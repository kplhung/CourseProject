        <p>Charitable giving grew faster than the economy last year, although it did not quite keep pace with the tremendous accumulation in wealth, according to figures released yesterday.</p>
        <p>The ebullient stock market and the prosperous economy helped drive donations to charity up nearly $16 billion, to $190.2 billion, 9.1 percent higher than in 1998 and well ahead of the 5.7 percent growth in gross domestic product, according to the figures, estimates presented by the A.A.F.R.C. Trust for Philanthropy, the nonprofit arm of the American Association of Fund-Raising Counsel.</p>
        <p>After inflation, donations increased 6.7 percent, making 1999 the fifth year in a row that they rose in ''real'' dollars.</p>
        <p>And, said the philanthropy trust,  which uses an economic model to estimate annual charitable contributions, donations equaled 2.1 percent of gross domestic product, the highest level by that barometer in 28  years.</p>
        <p>Fund-raising executives and others called the growth substantial. President Clinton's domestic policy adviser, Bruce Reed, who spoke at a Manhattan news conference where the trust issued its figures, referred to ''a new golden age of philanthropy in America.''</p>
        <p>''The new figures are remarkable,'' Mr. Reed said, adding that giving in the last seven years now totaled $1 trillion.</p>
        <p>Since 1995, charitable giving has risen 53 percent, or 40 percent after inflation. The fund-raising association's chairman, George C. Ruotolo Jr., called the rise ''meteoric.''</p>
        <p>Despite last year's gains -- and huge contributions from some Internet billionaires like William H. Gates of Microsoft -- the growth in giving appears not to have kept up with the growth in wealth. Using the figures released yesterday, Edward N. Wolff, an economics professor at New York University, calculated that giving amounted to 0.69 percent of the nation's wealth last year --  down from 0.71 percent in 1998, although slightly ahead of the 0.68 percent of 1997.</p>
        <p>Daniel Feenberg, a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research and member of the fund-raising association's advisory council on methodology, suggests that another yardstick to measure charitable giving is its relation to personal consumption. He too used the figures released yesterday, and calculated that donations last year equaled 3 percent of personal consumption expenditures, up slightly from 1998 and a significant jump from the 2.5 percent in 1995 but still below the 3.3 percent of the late 1960's.</p>
        <p>''There has been steady growth over the past five years, but we are still not back to the historic peak,'' Mr. Feenberg said, although he cautioned that the association figures on which he was basing his calculations were only estimates.</p>
        <p>Giving by foundations last year rose at more than twice the rate of individual giving, spurred by a law that requires them to give away at least 5 percent of their assets each year. (They are allowed to average their assets over several years to even out their spending.)</p>
        <p>The bullish equity markets, which provided most foundations large gains in their endowments, forced them to increase their giving sharply. Grants by noncorporate foundations jumped 16.5 percent, to $19.8 billion from $17 billion.</p>
        <p>The Foundation Center, a New York-based group that gathers data on foundations, reported that the number of them had also been surging in recent years. By the end of 1998, there were 46,832 foundations, up from 23,770 in 1982. (The center does not yet have figures for 1999.)</p>
        <p>In contrast with the extraordinarily robust growth of foundation giving, personal giving -- which accounts for about three-quarters of all donations -- was up 7 percent last year, to $143.7 billion from $134.1 billion.</p>
        <p>The A.A.F.R.C. Trust said philanthropic giving by individuals amounted to 1.8 percent of personal income last year, the same as in 1998 but up from 1.5 percent in 1995. The last time personal giving was above the 1.8 percent level was 1973, when it reached 1.9 percent.</p>
        <p>After personal giving and donations by noncorporate foundations, the two remaining categories of charitable contributions are bequests and corporate giving, both of which had a good year. Bequests rose $2.8 billion, to $15.6 billion, while corporate giving climbed $1.4 billion, to $11 billion.</p>
        <p>Religious charities remained by far the largest recipients of charitable giving by Americans, receiving nearly $82 billion, a rise of 5.5 percent from 1998.</p>
        <p>Education organizations, including universities, were the second-largest recipient, with $27.5 billion, an 8.5 percent increase.</p>
        <p>The sharpest gain in percentage terms was to organizations focused on international affairs, like Doctors Without Borders and the United Nations Foundation, although the total still remained relatively small. Donations to these groups rose 24 percent, to $2.7 billion.</p>
        <p>Environment and wildlife organizations also enjoyed a strong increase, 11 percent, to $5.8 billion.</p>
        <p>The charitable giving data released yesterday is available on the fund-raising association's Web site (www.aafrc.org). A more detailed picture of charitable giving in 1999 will be contained in the association's  book ''Giving U.S.A. 2000,'' which will be available on disk in June and in book form in September.</p>
