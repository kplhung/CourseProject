        <p>WHILE experts argue the efficacy of building America's space-based Strategic Defense Initiative, here on Earth one of the nation's most trusted defense systems will, by year's end, be dismantled.</p>
        <p>Scotchgard, the soil-retardant and stain-repellent spray made by the 3M Company of St. Paul, is being ''phased out,'' the company announced on May 16, because of environmental concerns about a chemical used to make it, perfluorooctanyl. The same stuff that makes it easy to lift a blob of chip dip off a carpet is, it turns out, harder to get off the planet. Scotchgard stain prevention products do not decompose.</p>
        <p>As Prof. Ned Brainard, played by Fred MacMurray in the 1961 movie ''The Absent-Minded Professor,'' said of flying rubber, or Flubber, ''It's a substance whose behavior is disturbingly nonclassical.''</p>
        <p>The company's move to discontinue Scotchgard was voluntary. (Manufacture will not stop for some months, 3M says; availability will depend on store inventories.) But the Environmental Protection Agency said on May 18 that it had been poised to remove it from the market if the company had not taken action.</p>
        <p>''We would advise consumers to adopt a precautionary approach,'' said Stephen Johnson, deputy assistant administrator for the agency's office of prevention, pesticides and toxic substances. ''Given the agency's concerns about long-term exposure, people should exercise judgment as to whether to use the materials.''</p>
        <p>The dirt of the ages appears to have won a round. Though there are other protective products, including DuPont's Stainmaster, the Scotchgard announcement left many vendors and consumers unprotected from the vision of a future without soil retardance or stain repellence in clothing, home furnishings and floor coverings: three huge textile categories (with an estimated $45 billion in annual sales, according to the Census Bureau) in which the product is ubiquitous.</p>
        <p>With an air of national emergency, Heloise, the syndicated household-hints columnist, was scrambled like a fighter pilot by the ''Today'' show for a not very reassuring appearance two days after 3M's news.</p>
        <p>''I looked around my hotel room that night,'' she said, reached on a car telephone in Texas. ''Carpeting, drapes, bedspread -- probably all fabric protected.''</p>
        <p>Heloise, who had previously advised Bryant Gumbel and Matt Lauer to use fabric protector on favorite neckties, found herself confronted by an anxious public after the show. ''Everyone from my C.P.A. to flight attendants has said: 'Oh, we saw you. Are they taking it away?' '' she said.</p>
        <p>The news will only get worse, the columnist hinted darkly, her voice crackling from the highway. ''The first ramification is that the can is going away,'' she said, speaking of the home-application sprays available in hardware stores. Those three products are Scotchgard's Protector for Fabric and Upholstery, Protector for Rugs and Carpet and Protector for Leather. (Scotchgard cleaning products are not affected.)</p>
        <p>Scotchgard, which represents $300 million, or 2 percent, of 3M's $16 billion in annual sales, is more typically applied commercially, at the industrial level. ''In the manufacturing process, if you're going to get a new couch, and you have three kids under the age of 10,'' Heloise asked, ''are you going to be out of luck?''</p>
        <p>Good question. (And children aren't the only problem: your Jack Russell terrier doesn't wipe its feet either.) From popular midpriced furniture manufacturers like La-Z-Boy to Hickory Chair, which licenses collections from decorators like Thomas O'Brien and the late Mark Hampton, soil and stain protection is prevalent in upholstered products. Ninety percent of La-Z-Boy's stain-preventive fabrics are treated with Scotchgard. The company has called 3M in for a meeting to discuss the strategy and timetable for withdrawing Scotchgard and for assurances about the product's safety, said Greg White, vice president for merchandising at La-Z-Boy.</p>
        <p>In a spectacular piece of bad timing, 3M introduced a national magazine advertising campaign late last year extolling the Scotchgard-protected life.</p>
        <p>''Got a life? Gotta ask for Scotchgard,'' the ad reads in the current issue of Martha Stewart Living. In the picture, a child playing on a carpet is spilling juice on her doll.</p>
        <p>The Scotchgard brand enjoys the highest consumer recognition of any protective finish, according to a 1999 survey of brands by HFN, a home furnishings industry publication. DuPont's Teflon was No. 2.</p>
        <p>Teflon's chemistry, which does not include the perfluorooctanyl in Scotchgard, is the effective agent in DuPont's competitive product, Stainmaster, a popular carpet fiber with protective chemicals integrated into the fiber. Allan Wolk, DuPont's vice president and general manager for global flooring and nylon in North America, said that despite Scotchgard's withdrawal, the company has no plans to introduce home-application protective sprays, which are not now a part of DuPont's product line.</p>
        <p>Scotchgard, which has a toll-free telephone service center that answers consumers' questions on its products and warranties (for ''Scotchgard Soil and Stain Release'' carpet protection, a five-year guarantee against common food and beverage stains, including bearnaise and hollandaise sauce), reported an increase in queries, and concerns about both supply and safety.</p>
        <p>Housekeeping experts, including Heloise, agreed that there are no traditional recipes for similar soil and stain protection -- only wisdom about stain removal.</p>
        <p>In an informal experiment, an unpeeled white potato that was sprayed with Scotchgard on one side but not the other displayed admirable, indistinguishable soil, water and stain repellence on both sides, suggesting that, apart from environmental and toxicity issues, Scotchgard's absence will be bad news for couch potatoes, but not potatoes.</p>
        <p>Apparently the peace of mind promised by products like Scotchgard was invented with them in the 1950's, by laboratory researchers like Patsy Sherman, who got the idea for a stain-prevention product when a colleague at 3M accidentally splashed a fluorochemical-latex emulsion on her tennis shoes. The doused shoes repelled water and solvents. (Presciently, the team never discovered a way of getting the gunk off the shoes.) Scotchgard was introduced to consumers in 1956.</p>
        <p>Sheep could be the big winners in a world without it. Wool is water- and stain-resistant.</p>
        <p>''With wool it's not an issue,'' said Mark Saley, marketing director of floor coverings at ABC Carpet &amp; Home in New York. ''It's inherently stain-resistant, because of the lanolin in the wool. And it repels dirt, because it's porous, not solid fiber like nylon. It's mostly a nylon issue.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolk at DuPont, which could be the other clear winner with Scotchgard's demise, estimated that nylon carpet manufacturing was a $6.4 billion a year business that, as is said of witnesses, needed protection. Daniel Salant, the owner of the Budget Plastic Cover Company in the Bronx, which has made plastic slipcovers for 30 years, believes in his product but isn't waiting for history to reverse itself.</p>
        <p>''It's impervious to anything,'' he said of a plastic slipcover. ''Stain protection isn't.''</p>
        <p>''There's something that will stain anything,'' he added, sounding almost philosophical. Scotchgard was never the enemy: Mr. Salant explained that the introduction of fabric protectors never affected his sales.</p>
        <p>''Certain people are plastic slipcover people,'' he said. ''I see very little impact.''</p>
