        <p>If the proposal by the UAL Corporation to buy US Airways clears government and shareholder hurdles, members of the US Airways frequent-flier program could find themselves in the unaccustomed position of winners.</p>
        <p>Even though much of the fine print has not been made public, Kurt Ebenhoch, a spokesman for United Airlines, which is owned by UAL, said yesterday, ''By the time this deal is consummated next year, our two airlines will be one and US Airways frequent-flier members will become United Mileage Plus members.''</p>

        <p>If the proposal by the UAL Corporation to buy US Airways clears government and shareholder hurdles, members of the US Airways frequent-flier program could find themselves in the unaccustomed position of winners.</p>
        <p>Even though much of the fine print has not been made public, Kurt Ebenhoch, a spokesman for United Airlines, which is owned by UAL, said yesterday, ''By the time this deal is consummated next year, our two airlines will be one and US Airways frequent-flier members will become United Mileage Plus members.''</p>
        <p>''The difference,'' he said, ''is that US Airways members will then have the opportunity to accrue miles faster, to redeem them for more places and to earn flights with our 22 airline partners.''</p>
        <p>Among those partners are the 11 members of the Star Alliance, comprising United as well as airlines from Austria, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Germany, Japan, New Zealand, Scandinavia, Singapore and Thailand -- in short, much of the world.</p>
        <p>The US Airways alliance with American Airlines, which includes honoring each other's frequent-flier programs, remains in force. ''Until the acquisition takes place,'' said David Castelveter, a spokesman for US Airways, ''it's business as usual.''</p>
        <p>Although United promises to freeze some domestic fares for two years after the acquisition, except for increases to pay for fuel costs and inflation, some industry experts think the deal will ultimately lead to higher prices for passengers, especially in the Northeast.</p>
        <p>''I think the merger will be a good one,'' said Terry Trippler, the airline writer for 1Travel.com. ''But if a lessening of competition does not result in higher prices, it will be the first time in history.''</p>
        <p>Still, even outsiders agree that US Airways' frequent-flier passengers stand to benefit by gaining access to more flights and more destinations. ''Except for Southwest, US Airways is the only one of the major airlines without flights to Hawaii, which is by far the preferred destination of most frequent fliers,'' said Randy Peterson, the editor and publisher of Inside Flier magazine. United has daily flights to Hawaii from Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>''While US Airways' frequent-flier program has always been a competent follower,'' Mr. Peterson said, ''it has never been a leader. Now it will be aligned with a leader.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Trippler added that United's extensive routes to Asia and the Pacific and South America will also be a big plus for US Airways frequent-flier members, as will United's many more flights to cities in Europe.</p>
        <p>Moreover, United has far fewer flights to Florida than does US Airways, so the acquisition is likely to give passengers who participate in United's Mileage Plus program a wider choice of flights and destinations to that state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peterson and Mr. Trippler both pointed out, however, that frequent-flier ''reward'' flights to Hawaii are often very difficult to get and Florida destinations are scarce much of the year.</p>
        <p>US Airways has hubs in Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Baltimore and Charlotte, N.C., while United hubs are in Chicago, Denver, Los Angeles and San Francisco and at Dulles International Airport in Washington. United has already said that it will increase flights from Pittsburgh and possibly Philadelphia and Charlotte.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, passengers to and from Washington are likely to benefit if DC Air -- the airline start-up that is expected to be owned by BET Holdings II, the parent company of the Black Entertainment Television -- becomes a low-fare carrier. BET's owner, Robert L. Jackson, has been a member of the US Airways board since 1998. The airline, which will operate from Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington, will fill the void created by United's plan  to sell its slots and other operations there to satisfy regulators.</p>
