      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Shante Proctor, an 11-year-old fifth grader from the East New York section of Brooklyn, has had four teachers this year. In four years, her school has had four principals.</p>
        <p>Her classmates have also changed regularly. Poverty -- in the guise of evictions, job changes, assignment to homeless shelters -- has kept them on the move. Last year, for every 10 students who started with Shante in September at Public School 190, four were gone by June.</p>
        <p>Shante, streetwise yet ebullient, was hard pressed to come up with the names of students who had left, or express feelings about their departures.</p>
        <p>''People just go,'' she said on a recent sunny afternoon, shrugging a wiry shoulder as she stood with three friends outside the school on Sheffield Avenue.</p>
        <p>Low-performing public schools are often criticized for flabby curriculums, petty politics and lack of rigor. P.S. 190 is no exception. It is one of the city's least successful schools.</p>
        <p>But the challenge P.S. 190 and schools like it face from the constant churn in personnel and pupils is one of the school system's least acknowledged and most intractable difficulties. Mobility has become a major source of concern for school systems across the country as housing costs rise, families change neighborhoods, immigrants continue to stream into American's cities and teachers leave the profession or shift schools.</p>
        <p>The simple truth is that at many poor schools, neither students nor teachers nor principals stay long enough for any curriculum, innovative or traditional, to take root.</p>
        <p>''We have had to teach students the alphabet in the fifth grade because they've never been anywhere long enough to learn it,'' said Carolyn Reed, a teacher's aide who has worked at P.S. 190 for 26 years. ''You worry at night if a child that you've helped develop reading and math skills is going to disappear one day.''</p>
        <p>The instability poisons the atmosphere. It affects not only how teachers teach but how they view their superiors and their own colleagues. They often confine themselves in their classrooms. Parents grow angry and distrustful; students become lost and listless.</p>
        <p>Test scores stay low, and review materials become staples for the stream of newly arriving students. Shante, who was left back once, is a year behind.</p>
        <p>Such churning has existed for years, of course, but it has grown into a more serious challenge as school systems impose high-stakes tests that cast a sharper spotlight on the failure of high-mobility schools and as the continuing decline in vocational jobs makes graduation from high school and attending college more important. Mobility has become a significant new focal point of education reform groups trying to understand student achievement.</p>
        <p>''If a child moves once, it does not hinder learning,'' said Linda Rawson Gonzalez Kaminski, chief academic officer of the Santa Ana Unified School District, who has studied the high student mobility in her district and elsewhere. ''But it is problematic when they move multiple times. They begin to develop gaps in their education.''</p>
        <p>The problem is one that the new chancellor, Harold O. Levy, will be tangling with in one form or another. In recent years, the system has had an influx of students from the Caribbean, who often come into the system midyear and take extended leaves to visit relatives in their homeland. Mr. Levy is working with the countries to link the educational systems and recruit teachers, he said.</p>
        <p>''Student mobility is perhaps the hardest problem, because it is often the function of circumstances beyond the control of the board,'' he said, adding that an incentive to keep experienced teachers in failing schools addresses teacher turnover.</p>
        <p>Last year, 18.8 percent of New York City's elementary and middle school students changed schools before June, a number that has remained steady for a decade, according to the Board of Education's office of assessment and accountability.</p>
        <p>There is no comparable recent data nationally because no one has collected it. The most recent report on student mobility, from the General Accounting Office in 1994, however, said that 17 percent of the country's third graders attended at least three different schools since starting first grade.</p>
        <p>Yvonne T. Moore, a substitute teacher who has worked in the New York City school system for 24 years, recalls the frustration of walking into Shante's classroom in P.S. 190 in November as the students' third teacher that school year. Ms. Moore left the school in March after circumstances that are in dispute.</p>
        <p>''I had to start from scratch because none of the teachers who had them before left any notes on what they had covered in social studies, math or English,'' she said. ''I had to learn what kind of students they were. I had to get used to the environment. It took a lot of time.''</p>
        <p>She created tests in all subjects to learn what students were capable of and quickly learned that the 20 students lacked many basic skills. Many did not know how to use periods, commas, capital letters or other basic grammar that most fifth graders are expected to know, Ms. Moore said. In mathematics, most had to use calculators or beads to solve multiplication problems in the hundreds, a skill that is a city standard for fifth graders, she said.</p>
        <p>''If someone had taken the time to evaluate these children in the first or second grade, they could have had some academic intervention,'' Ms. Moore said. ''But because there was so much instability at school and home, no one caught it, and they have been promoted and promoted.''</p>
        <p>Student mobility is driven mostly by issues unrelated to school. Some students move because their parents fall behind in rent and are evicted. Other families live in homeless shelters, or doubled up with relatives in cramped quarters. When parents find permanent housing, they move their children again, sometimes too far for them to stay in the same school. Still other children are in foster care and may move as their guardians change. Immigrants will sometimes live with relatives before finding more permanent housing.</p>
        <p>''It's a challenge for us, but it's more of a challenge for the child,'' Brenda Parris-Harper, who became principal of P.S. 190 in September, said of student mobility.</p>
        <p>P.S. 190 is typical of schools with high mobility. Only half of its 50 teachers have been there for more than two years. Almost all of the 500 students attending the school live below the poverty line. Only 22 percent of its students scored at or above grade level on the citywide reading test, and 19 percent scored at or above grade level on the math test. P.S. 190 is roughly 70 percent black and 30 percent Hispanic. Ten percent of its students live in shelters. P.S. 190 is surrounded by street-corner drug dealers and boarded up buildings.</p>
        <p>Mobility at P.S. 190 continues to be high, even with a recent city regulation requiring shelters to allow families to stay for up to a year. The measure has not been a cure-all, because families do not always arrive at shelters on the same schedule as the school year.</p>
        <p>''If I can keep you in a stable environment, I can measure your academic advancement,'' said Ivan Blake, director of pupil personnel in Community School District 19, which oversees P.S. 190. ''When children move from school to school, I have no way of finding out exactly what they have learned at all those other places,'' he said of years past, when schools made less of a concerted effort to transfer student records. ''When they take the big test and their scores comes out, all we can say is, 'Oh, you failed.' ''</p>
        <p>By the time Shante arrived at P.S. 190 four years ago, she had already attended three schools. Her mother, Alfreda Jackson, 41, had fallen on hard times and found herself moving from place to place. Shante was in the second grade when Ms. Jackson, who is now a home health care worker, found a permanent home on Bradford Street in East New York. Last year, she was held back in the fifth grade, and Ms. Jackson received a letter warning that her daughter's promotion was in doubt.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jackson accepts some of the blame for Shante's academic woes: ''We don't have any books in the house. They're still packed in boxes.''</p>
        <p>But she said she believes most of the problem is that her daughter has been whipsawed by the constant turnover at P.S. 190.</p>
        <p>''I tell her she's been in school all day, why is it that she doesn't know anything?'' Ms. Jackson said. ''I know what it is, nobody knows who is in charge at the school, with principals and teachers in and out the door. One teacher teaches one way, while another teaches a different way. It's not right, because the children suffer.''</p>
        <p>In 1996, the principal of six years, Jack Adler, retired, and was replaced by two people who successively held the job temporarily. This year, Ms. Parris-Harper, who was an assistant principal at P.S. 174 in District 19, was hired. She has worked in the system for 12 years.</p>
        <p>When she arrived, it was obvious that the school was rudderless. It did not have a librarian or special education guidance counselor. Teacher morale was low.</p>
        <p>''There are still many challenges,'' Ms. Parris-Harper, said. ''But what I really want is a stable building. If a child stays with us for a year or six months, we want them to say, 'I can trust this place.' If a school is structured, learning can happen even in high mobility schools.''</p>
        <p>Much of the staff turnover is due to the departure of young and inexperienced teachers who are not prepared to work in inner-city environments. Effective this August, the the state education commissioner, Richard P. Mills, has banned failing schools from hiring uncertified teachers. But Mr. Levy has said that he may not be able to hire only certified teachers at the city's 97 most troubled schools because of inadequate salaries, which are up to 25 percent lower than those in the suburbs.</p>
        <p>Ms. Harper depends on the few stalwarts like Ellen Asregadoo, 32, a Guyanese immigrant who teaches fourth grade and has been at the school for seven years. The job was Ms. Asregadoo's first full-time teaching job out of college, and she refused to follow other teachers out the door, she said.</p>
        <p>Walking around her classroom recently, a slant of sun shining through the window, Ms. Asregadoo used small, colorful cubes to help students solve division problems. It was not immediately apparent, but she is intimately involved in many of the lives of the 25 students.</p>
        <p>So far this year, only two students have left her classroom, and none have come in. It is a departure from prior years, she said, when up to six children would come and go.</p>
        <p>To help students feel welcome and to offset the movement, she and other teachers have established a buddy system to help newcomers feel at ease and to help them catch up. She is also pleased that P.S. 190 began using a literacy curriculum from Johns Hopkins University that groups students in 90-minute classes.</p>
        <p>''Before last year, we had outdated textbooks,'' Ms. Asregadoo said. ''Everyone just did what they wanted to do.''</p>
        <p>Still, she expressed concern about maintaining continuity next year.</p>
        <p>''I just hope next year there is not another change,'' Ms. Parris-Harper said. ''Everyone brings their own little programs and expect miracles to happen. But when you you talk about East New York, which has its own set of problems, it is very difficult.''</p>
