        <p>An unexpected coalition of City Council members introduced legislation yesterday to abolish the Art Commission, a mayoral panel that has sat in judgment over artwork and architecture on city-owned property for more than a century.</p>
        <p>The Council group said the commission, in what they described as a slow and arbitrary review process, delayed and even derailed improvements to parks or public property over aesthetic questions they considered petty.</p>
        <p>The commission, made up mostly of mayoral appointees and people involved in the arts, has jurisdiction over a wide spectrum of public art and architecture, including approving designs for major public buildings, park benches, light fixtures and signs on city structures, and dealing with broader questions in the design of bridges and major public projects.</p>
        <p>The commission is also custodian of the city's collection of art, but its authority does not extend to exhibits  in city art museums, since it rules only on art or architecture that will remain in place for longer than a year.</p>
        <p>''The Art Commission has managed to antagonize almost every member of the Council,'' said Phil Reed, a Harlem Democrat and one of 19 members of the 51-person Council who said yesterday that they would support the bill. The group includes some of the Council's most liberal and most conservative members.</p>
        <p>But Jean Parker Phifer, a Manhattan architect and president of the Art Commission, said in an interview yesterday that the council's bill was the equivalent of ''trying to throw out the Department of Transportation just because you don't like the way stop lights are coordinated.''</p>
        <p>''We are certainly anxious to improve our relations and we never mean to give offense,'' she said. ''But we have a 100-year tradition of successful operations, and playing an important role in the quality of visual life in the city.''</p>
        <p>The bill, which apparently took members of the Arts Commission and the mayor's office by surprise, immediately provoked fierce opposition from arts groups outside City Hall, who described the commission as an essential clearinghouse for aesthetic judgments.</p>
        <p>''This is just a dumb idea,'' said Frank Sanchis, executive director of the Municipal Art Society, a nonprofit group that has influenced city planning and public architecture through most of the century.</p>
        <p>''You need a reasoned voice coming not only from the private sector but from the government,'' he said. In artistic judgments affecting public property, ''God is in the details, and the Art Commission assures they will be taken into account,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Whether the group of Council members will succeed in dismantling the commission, which has operated since 1898 as a voluntary panel of artists, architects and others from outside City Hall, was unclear yesterday.</p>
        <p>Minutes after the bill was introduced, the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, said in an interview that he would oppose it. ''We may disagree with decisions by the Art Commission, but this bill goes in the wrong direction,'' he said.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the mayor, Edward Skylar, said last night that the mayor was withholding judgment while the bill was reviewed by the city's legal staff.</p>
        <p>The City Charter requires that the commission have 11 members, including a painter, a sculptor, an architect, a landscape architect and representatives of major cultural institutions. Under yesterday's bill, the authority of the Art Commission would be transferred to the Planning Commission, the Parks Commission and the Landmarks Preservation Commission.</p>
        <p>''I know they have an important function as outside experts and watchdogs,'' said Christine Quinn, a Democratic councilwoman from the West Side of Manhattan. ''But they are so far outside the system that they don't work collaboratively. They only block things.''</p>
        <p>The Council members' anger at the Art Commission erupted yesterday after a legal dispute between the commission and Henry J. Stern, the parks commissioner, over the placement last year of more than 100 flagpoles in parks and at war memorials. The poles were designed with military yardarms, resembling cross bars on top, and supporting the flags of the United States, the city and the Parks Department.</p>
        <p>A lawsuit filed by a former commission president, Reba White Williams, and settled out of court, said Mr. Stern had authorized the installation of the yardarms without review by the Art Commission. The Parks Department has since agreed to have them examined by the panel and, in some cases, removed.</p>
        <p>''A personal pique with Henry Stern should not impact people in my district,'' said James S. Oddo, a Republican from Staten Island and principal sponsor of the Council bill.</p>
        <p>One of the yardarms ordered removed was at Frederick Staats Circle on Staten Island, he said, during a process that he called ''unnecessary, cantankerous, confrontational and unproductive.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Oddo said he considered his experience with the flagpole issue the last straw, after repeated disputes with the commission.</p>
        <p>But among even the most determined critics on the Council, there appeared room for compromise yesterday, perhaps through public hearings in which the Art Commission would be called to task for its procedures and some of its decisions.  ''Maybe this will at least lead to them coming before us so we can insist on accountability,'' Mr. Oddo said.</p>
        <p>But others said they doubted that the Art Commission, with its long tradition of independence, would agree to the Council's demands.</p>
        <p>''They have brought this on themselves because of their own arrogance,'' said Walter L. McCaffrey, a Democrat from Queens. He said he had favored disbanding the commission since the late 1980's, when it blocked a privately financed Vietnam War Memorial in Woodside because the inscription made two references to God.</p>
        <p>''I am always open to the possibility of redemption,'' he said. ''But we are all just fed up, and in this case I don't think it will happen.''</p>
