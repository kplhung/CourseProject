        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I think the article about the difficulty of being connected to the Internet in rural areas (''Life in the Slow Lane,'' May 18) fails to appreciate how much of the country is electronically underserved. I live in Westchester -- true, it's the northeast corner, but it's Westchester. My Internet connection maxes out at 24K, with slower speeds common.</p>

        <p>I think the article about the difficulty of being connected to the Internet in rural areas (''Life in the Slow Lane,'' May 18) fails to appreciate how much of the country is electronically underserved. I live in Westchester -- true, it's the northeast corner, but it's Westchester. My Internet connection maxes out at 24K, with slower speeds common.</p>
        <p>We do have cable television here, but we will presumably get broadband cable service, or D.S.L., when Hades becomes frigid. We don't even have decent cellular phone service. There is analog, which comes and goes as you drive around here, but no digital.</p>
        <p>Please be aware that Rural 'R' Us, at least as far as electronic connections are concerned.</p>
