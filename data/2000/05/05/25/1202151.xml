        <p>It came as a surprise to many in 1995 that the Cincinnati Symphony was turning 100. It is older than better-known counterparts in Philadelphia and Cleveland. Yet the orchestra is by no means the oldest musical institution in this city of Germanic traditions.</p>
        <p>That distinction belongs to a choral event, the May Festival, founded in 1873. The sprawling Music Hall, which opened in 1878 and is now the home of the orchestra, was actually built for the festival.</p>
        <p>So the May Festival may be more entitled than most to greet the new millennium in a grandiose way, as James Conlon, its music director of 21 years, decided to do this season.</p>
        <p>Two huge works anchor the affair -- Mahler's Eighth Symphony, last Saturday, and Schoenberg's ''Gurrelieder,'' next Saturday -- and reinforcements, the Concert Chorus of the City of Dusseldorf, have been brought in to add the needed heft.</p>
        <p>Not that the May Festival Chorus lacks substance. An amateur group, it was founded in 1880, 700 strong, down 100 from the combined choruses at the first festival. Having evolved with changing times -- specifically, a decline in amateur music-making and a concern to emulate performance practices of earlier eras -- it now numbers 135.</p>
        <p>That is still large for, say, Mozart's C minor Mass (K. 427), which was what remained of the opening concert on Friday evening after a day of flight delays from New York. But it is good to see so worthy a tradition survive on some level, the more so in that it still represents a significant degree of community involvement in what has become a year-round enterprise. And as trained by Robert Porco, a noted choral specialist, the festival chorus acquitted itself admirably, alternating lightness with strength where needed and singing with generally sure intonation and good unanimity.</p>
        <p>In the first half of that program, it was a shame to have missed especially the chorales from Bach's Cantata No. 147, the source of countless ''Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring'' arrangements. To give the audience some idea of the changing, contracting times, Mr. Conlon performed one in a big Romantic expansion and the other more in line with current notions of proper Baroque style.</p>
        <p>Such minimalist concerns hardly affect the Mahler, the ''Symphony of a Thousand.'' The festival gave the fourth performance of this work in the United States in 1931, with Eugene Goossens conducting more than the specified number of performers, including some 900 voices, and the Cincinnati Symphony, which joined the festival in 1905. Here, with the Dusseldorf chorus, the Cincinnati Boychoir and the requisite vocal soloists, the forces numbered 482.</p>
        <p>It was a good size for Music Hall, and the finely restrained quiet singing of the adult choirs (totaling 260) was as remarkable as many a sonorous outburst. But the endings of the two movements were spectacular in their force, as rousing as any this longtime Mahlerian has heard.</p>
        <p>In a sharply contrasted preconcert recital on Saturday, Kristine Jepson, a mezzo-soprano and the best of an uneven lot of vocal soloists over the weekend, performed songs by Duparc and Gene Sheer wonderfully, with Thomas Muraco as pianist.</p>
        <p>This despite the oversize setting of a hall with 3,400 seats, most of which were full for the big concerts.</p>
        <p>The festival's first weekend ended with a concert on Sunday evening at the Cathedral Basilica of the Assumption in nearby Covington, Ky. Further showing the range of community involvement, the May Festival Youth Chorus opened the program handsomely with a cappella numbers by  Scarlatti, Monteverdi and Palestrina.</p>
        <p>Then the May Festival Chamber Choir, led by Mr. Porco, took over as main attraction. Justly popular works of Bach, the motet ''Jesu, Meine Freude'' (''Jesus, My Joy'') and the Cantata No. 106, ''Gottes Zeit Ist die Allerbest Zeit'' (''God's Time Is the Best Time of All''), were followed by a lovely rarity, Giacomo Carissimi's oratorio ''Jephte,'' in fetching accounts.</p>
        <p>Now on to Orff's ''Carmina Burana,'' on Friday, and the big bang of ''Gurrelieder.''</p>
