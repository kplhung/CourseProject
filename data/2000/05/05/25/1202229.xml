        <p>The scientist who ran a gene therapy study that killed an 18-year-old patient at the University of Pennsylvania will no longer conduct experiments on people, and the prestigious gene therapy institute he founded is being scaled back, university officials announced today.</p>
        <p>Instead, Dr. James M. Wilson, who as director of the university's Institute for Human Gene Therapy has been regarded as one of the bright young stars of his field, will restrict his work to the study of molecules and cells, and will experiment only on animals. Those restrictions will also apply to other scientists working under the auspices of the institute.</p>
        <p>''We think that Dr. Wilson was overloaded with regard to responsibility,'' the university's president, Dr. Judith Rodin, said at a news  conference. Dr. Rodin described the decision as one in a series of steps the university is taking to improve patient safety in all experiments and to reduce any appearance of conflict of interest in scientific research.</p>
        <p>The move will have no immediate practical effect, because the Food and Drug Administration has already suspended all human experiments at the institute. Nor does it necessarily end gene therapy clinical trials at the university. Doctors in other disciplines may conduct such experiments, Dr. Rodin said, although they will be reviewed by a special ethics panel from now on.</p>
        <p>But for Dr. Wilson, who over the past seven years built his institute into the nation's largest academic gene therapy program, the decision is a major setback.</p>
        <p>He is facing the threat of a lawsuit  by the family of the young man who died, Jesse Gelsinger, and still must contend with an investigation by the F.D.A., which uncovered a number of deficiencies in his program in the wake of Mr. Gelsinger's death.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Dr. Rodin said, the university is re-examining its relationship to the biotechnology company that Dr. Wilson founded, Genovo. The company contributes a fifth of the $25 million annual budget at the gene therapy institute, and in return has exclusive rights to develop Dr. Wilson's discoveries into commercial products.</p>
        <p>In addition, the gene therapy institute will stop manufacturing the genetically altered viruses that are used to introduce genes into cells, known as vectors.</p>
        <p>Dr. Wilson did not grant interviews today, but issued a terse statement saying that he felt ''confident that the steps outlined today will help position Penn as a model environment for the conduct of all types of clinical research, especially gene therapy.''</p>
        <p>One leading scientist in the field, Dr. W. French Anderson, who in 1990 conducted the first gene therapy experiment, described the university's move as an overreaction. ''This is throwing the baby out with the bath water,'' Dr. Anderson said. ''It basically eliminates the gene therapy program if you can't run trials.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Rodin's announcement came in conjunction with the release of a report by an independent panel of experts that evaluated the gene therapy institute at her request. The six-member panel, led by Dr. William H. Danforth, chancellor emeritus of Washington University in St. Louis, strongly suggested, but did not explicitly recommend, that clinical trials at the institute be stopped.</p>
        <p>The experts raised serious questions about how well human gene therapy studies were being monitored at the university. They concluded, essentially, that either because of lack of knowledge or financial resources the institute was not capable of complying with the federal regulations governing clinical trials. Should clinical trials continue under the institute's auspices, the report said, ''hundreds of standard operating procedures must be developed, recorded and put into exact operation.''</p>
        <p>Rather than strengthen the institute, the university chose to devote its resources to more intensive monitoring of all the clinical trials it conducts.</p>
        <p>Dr. Danforth's committee also called for the university to re-evaluate its hospital experimentation committees, which review proposals for clinical trials. And it recommended that the university review its policies on conflict of interest, to avoid even the appearance of conflict.</p>
        <p>Dr. Rodin said the university would follow the panel's recommendations. But she said that Dr. Wilson had complied with ''fairly strict and unusual constraints'' regarding conflict of interest.</p>
        <p>Given the committee's findings, Dr. Inder Verma, a panel member, said Dr. Rodin had two choices: She could either give the gene therapy institute more staff members and outside supervision, or restrict it to basic scientific research.</p>
        <p>To restrict the institute, Dr. Verma said, was ''a very reasonable thing.'' Yet Dr. Verma said he and the other panel members came away with the strong impression that before Mr. Gelsinger's death, Dr. Wilson and his colleagues had been doing the best they could to follow the F.D.A.'s rules.</p>
        <p>Dr. Arthur Caplan, the director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, said such scrutiny of gene therapy is likely to continue for some time, particularly at the institute. ''Until his ship stops floundering,'' he said of Dr. Wilson, ''it is going to be steered by somebody else for a while.''</p>
