        <hl1>Mr. Clinton's Disbarment Case</hl1>
      </hedline>
      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial holds Arkansas disbarment proceeding is appropriate forum to hold Pres Clinton accountable for his false testimony about his relationship with Monica S Lewinsky in Paula Jones sexual harassment case; holds court should treat Clinton same as it would any other lawyer</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In recommending that President Clinton be disbarred for providing false testimony in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case, a disciplinary committee of the Arkansas Supreme Court has called for the harshest sanction at its disposal. The Arkansas courts will now have to decide whether disbarment is the right penalty for the president's dishonesty, given all the circumstances, or whether some lesser penalty such as a public reprimand or suspension of his license to practice law is more appropriate. But there is no doubt that Mr. Clinton must be called to account for his legal misconduct and that this disbarment proceeding is the appropriate forum in which to hold him accountable.</p>
        <p>The false testimony at the root of this matter came in 1998 during a deposition in the lawsuit by Paula Jones alleging that Mr. Clinton, while governor of Arkansas, had sexually harassed her. At one point Mr. Clinton, in attempting to deflect questions designed to show a pattern of bad behavior, denied having had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. The President contended then, and continues to maintain, that he did not technically lie because the activities he engaged in with Ms. Lewinsky did not fit the definition of sexual relations used in the trial. That argument was demolished by Judge Susan Webber Wright, who presided over the Paula Jones case. Cutting to the core issue, she found that the president had given ''intentionally false'' testimony under oath, fined him $90,000 and referred the matter to the disciplinary committee that has now recommended disbarment.</p>

        <p>The false testimony at the root of this matter came in 1998 during a deposition in the lawsuit by Paula Jones alleging that Mr. Clinton, while governor of Arkansas, had sexually harassed her. At one point Mr. Clinton, in attempting to deflect questions designed to show a pattern of bad behavior, denied having had sexual relations with Monica Lewinsky. The President contended then, and continues to maintain, that he did not technically lie because the activities he engaged in with Ms. Lewinsky did not fit the definition of sexual relations used in the trial. That argument was demolished by Judge Susan Webber Wright, who presided over the Paula Jones case. Cutting to the core issue, she found that the president had given ''intentionally false'' testimony under oath, fined him $90,000 and referred the matter to the disciplinary committee that has now recommended disbarment.</p>
        <p>The president's supporters cite what they consider mitigating circumstances. They note that Judge Wright ultimately dismissed the Jones case and ruled that Mr. Clinton's disputed testimony was not germane, so it is hard to argue that his false testimony harmed anyone. They add that Mr. Clinton's testimony was not delivered as a lawyer but as a private defendant in a lawsuit that he considered politically motivated. They also argue that in Arkansas disbarment is typically reserved for far worse crimes, like stealing from a client. All these factors need to be considered when the case is assigned to an Arkansas court. Indeed, the president's advocates are right that some other lawyers caught lying under oath in Arkansas have received reprimands rather than being disbarred.</p>
        <p>But the president and political allies like Senator Charles Schumer of New York demean the legal system when, without providing any evidence, they depict Mr. Clinton as a victim of political bias. Mr. Clinton's troubles did not originate in what Mr. Schumer called a ''kangaroo court.'' The president's credentials as an attorney are under challenge because he decided, after careful planning, to testify falsely.</p>
        <p>The Arkansas courts will now have to make an independent judgment on an appropriate punishment. In doing so, they should treat Mr. Clinton as they would any other lawyer caught giving false testimony in similar circumstances. They should not punish the president for who he is, just to make a symbolic statement. Nor should they grant him special leniency. Mr. Clinton deserves equal justice under the law, no more, no less.</p>
