        <p>Gideon W. Waldrop, a composer and administrator, who served for 24 years as dean of the Juilliard School of Music and for nearly three years as president of the Manhattan School of Music, died on Friday at his home in Manhattan. He was 80.</p>
        <p>Mr. Waldrop was born on Sept. 2, 1919, on a ranch just north of Abilene, Tex. He received a Bachelor of Music degree from Baylor University in Waco, Tex., and then served in the intelligence division of the Air Force during World War II, for which he was awarded the Bronze Star.</p>
        <p>After the war, Mr. Waldrop briefly taught at Baylor and conducted the Baylor University-Waco Symphony. He then entered the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, where he received his master's and doctoral degrees in composition, studying with Howard Hansen and Bernard Rogers.</p>
        <p>During the 1950's he was the editor of the Review of Recorded Music as well as the Musical Courier, and also served as a music consultant to the Ford Foundation. This work led him into the administrative field. In 1960 he became the assistant to the president at Juilliard and the next year was appointed dean. He was at that post in 1969 when the school moved from its old building on Claremont Avenue in Morningside Heights into its new $30 million building at Lincoln Center, which he described in an interview at the time as ''the Taj Mahal of conservatories.'' In fact, as the school grew the building seemed increasingly crowded.</p>
        <p>Following the death in 1983 of the Juilliard School's president, the composer Peter Mennin, Mr. Waldrop served as the acting president for one year.</p>
        <p>From 1986 until 1989 he was the president of the Manhattan School, which had taken over the old Juilliard building on Claremont Avenue. Mr. Waldrop resigned this post over disagreements with the board.</p>
        <p>He is survived by a brother, Samuel.</p>
