        <p>People are just trying to be nice when they offer Hannah Zeile a lollipop or some ice cream. Hannah is 2 years old, and she would love to accept the treats the way most kids her age would. But she recognizes the risk, and that is a relief to her parents.</p>
        <p>''People don't realize that just that little bit can really affect her,'' said Todd Zeile, the Mets first baseman and the father of Hannah, who has diabetes. ''But she's been good about that, knowing that she's a little different but not feeling outcast by it.''</p>
        <p>Last summer, Zeile's wife, Julianne, noticed that Hannah was excessively thirsty and wetting her diaper more often than normal. Julianne had a feeling something might be wrong, and over the All-Star Game break last July, the family traveled home to Southern California to see their pediatrician, who found that Hannah had Type 1 diabetes.</p>
        <p>Type 1 diabetes affects more than a million Americans; about one child in 600 to 700 is affected with the condition by the time he or she reaches high school. Short-term risks are seizures or loss of consciousness; later complications can include blindness, kidney failure or circulatory problems.</p>
        <p>The family spent much of the All-Star break at a hospital, learning how their lives would change. The good news, the Zeiles discovered, was that Hannah could lead a normal life with regular insulin injections (two shots daily) and blood glucose monitoring (four blood tests daily).</p>
        <p>''The not-so-good news,'' Zeile said, ''is that at this point, there is no cure. A lot of people think you outgrow it; you don't. You're insulin-dependent for life, or until there is a cure. So it's a constant, everyday battle for parents early on, and when the child gets old enough and independent enough, they can handle it on their own.''</p>
        <p>The Mets played the third game of a punishing road trip tonight in San Diego, dropping a 5-4 decision to the Padres; they fly to St. Louis for a weekend series, then shift back to California to meet the Los Angeles Dodgers for a three-game series starting Monday.</p>
        <p>That day, Zeile and Dodgers second baseman Mark Grudzielanek, whose brother has diabetes, will conduct a benefit at Dodger Stadium for the Children's Diabetes Center at U.C.L.A. Zeile is hoping to raise $250,000 through ticket purchases and a memorabilia auction.</p>
        <p>Dr. Kevin Kaiserman, the medical director of the center and Hannah Zeile's doctor, said the Zeiles have managed their daughter's condition well -- with help from their daughter.</p>
        <p>''Hannah is a very bright child, especially in terms of anticipating things and letting people know what her needs are,'' Kaiserman said. ''That helps a lot.''</p>
        <p>But it is still difficult for parents, Kaiserman said, because it is so hard to predict children's daily activity levels and food intake. It is important for children with diabetes to eat all the food prepared for them -- no more, no less. ''That's a very difficult thing for a young child,'' Kaiserman said.</p>
        <p>Zeile's schedule complicates things, because Hannah -- the second of the Zeiles' two children; Garrett is their 6-year-old son -- likes to greet her father when he arrives home from night games. But the odd hours also help, Zeile said. Hannah has twice had brief diabetic seizures, and though the condition was alleviated quickly, the episodes have sometimes made sleeping difficult for Julianne.</p>
        <p>''The fortunate thing is when I'm around, I get to bed really late and I don't need a lot of sleep, so I check Hannah in the late-night shifts,'' Zeile said. ''It's not even so much the staying up -- it enables Julianne to have the peace of mind that she can go to sleep and actually sleep comfortably, knowing that I'm there and that I'm going to check if Hannah's low.''</p>
        <p>Zeile, who lives in Thousand Oaks, Calif., and attended U.C.L.A., has adjusted to life in New York, a place he said always intrigued him. He left a comfortable situation as the Texas third baseman to sign a three-year, $18 million free-agent contract last winter to play first base for the Mets.</p>
        <p>After struggling at times early in the season, Zeile has adapted to the new position. He made 4 errors in the first 22 games but has made just 2 in the last 25. He has conditioned himself to think what he will do before doing it, trying to make playing first base instinctual.</p>
        <p>Zeile has always hit, and he is doing so again, batting .318 since April 28 to lift his average to .288, including tonight's 1-for-4 performance. That is .005 below his career-high mark for Texas last year.</p>
        <p>Zeile stroked a homer and a double in a Mets victory Tuesday, one day after he was passed over as a pinch-hitter with the bases loaded in the ninth inning of a 1-0 Mets loss.</p>
        <p>That surprised Zeile, but Manager Bobby Valentine said he was concerned that pinch-hitting for the struggling Jay Payton would shatter Payton's confidence.</p>
        <p>''Todd will never be pinch-hit for,'' Valentine said, ''and he'll have many a situation where he'll be counted on.''</p>
        <p>When it comes to their daughter, the Zeiles are counted on constantly.</p>
