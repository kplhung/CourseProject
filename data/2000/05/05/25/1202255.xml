        <p>This hillside Christian village, with its church spires and sweets shops, was the picturesque military center of the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon for two decades. Before noon today, the morning after the occupation zone precipitately collapsed, its stores were shuttered and its cobblestone streets nearly empty but for two young men with a clipboard.</p>
        <p>One of the men, Nadir Abdelkhalek, 25, a clean-cut financial analyst and member of a small occupation resistance group, checked the clipboard and pronounced his job done. Working off a roster, he and a colleague had gone door to door, rounding up 60 South Lebanese Army members who did not flee to Israel. All had surrendered, no weapons were drawn, and the town was now officially ''collaborator free,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''We acted in a calm manner, and told them that it was all over, welcome back to Lebanon,'' Mr. Abdelkhalek said. ''We didn't yell at them. We didn't rough them up. We just turned them over to the Lebanese police. And, of course, we pitied them.''</p>
        <p>Given that the Israeli withdrawal happened so suddenly, southern Lebanon was gripped by rapid tumult today, exultant but chaotic as the national landscape was redrawn in a night. Official Lebanon improvised a reaction to the instant reunification of the country, but it quickly became apparent that much remains undecided, starting with whether the military conflict with Israel was indeed over or was still on.</p>
        <p>Young men like Mr. Abdelkhalek -- most brandishing AK-47's or M-16's rather than clipboards -- took over the countryside. Six competing resistance groups, led by the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah, roamed the 400 square miles of southern Lebanon, jumping feet-first into the power vacuum left by Israel's quick withdrawal. So far, there is surprising calm, but it is a volatile situation.</p>
        <p>''Unless the army or a major internal security force moves in here quickly, you have to fear that the different groups will argue among themselves, and they are basically kids with guns,'' said Mohana Rafa, the police chief of the 20,000-resident town of Hasbeya.</p>
        <p>The Israeli-backed militia men are another potential friction point, and their fate is unclear. The Lebanese Army is holding some 1,250 men in army barracks in Baalbek; some are former militiamen, but some are people who crossed the border to work or even just for medical treatments.</p>
        <p>Officials say those men will proceed immediately to military tribunals to be judged on charges of treason. Based on what happened in the town of Jezzin, which was abandoned by Israel last year, experts expect short sentences of several months to a year for a most. Lebanon has few available prison beds. But it remains to be seen whether the government seeks to make an example of a few high-ranking militia officers to allay a demand for vengeance.</p>
        <p>Also unclear is the future of the half-deserted Christian towns, whose mood swung wildly between confusion and panic today.</p>
        <p>''Father, father, come quickly,'' yelled a woman who ran to fetch the priest from the St. George's Church in the town of Qlaia, adjacent to Merj  'Uyun. ''They are searching our houses.''</p>
        <p>''Not to worry,'' said the Rev. Fedi Salameh, 30, whose parish was cut in half on Tuesday, when 2,000 local Christians packed their cars and fled to Israel. ''Nothing will happen. The Hezbollah has given its word.''</p>
        <p>Israel spent its final night in Lebanon blowing up its positions and discharging its ammunition supply, so it went out in a fury of sound and smoke but more uneventfully than anyone would have imagined.</p>
        <p>Today, for the first time in decades, international monitors reported no Israeli violations of Lebanon's land, water and airspace.</p>
        <p>Israeli soldiers worked furiously to dismantle their border posts that overstep the 1923 international border. Israel wants the United Nations certification teams to be able to move in quickly and judge whether the withdrawal is complete.</p>
        <p>Lebanese officials have uttered contradictory opinions on whether they will accept the United Nations certification, since the organization has put aside Lebanon's claim over a piece of property at the edge of the Golan Heights. Israel is not planning to abandon the property, the Shebaa Farms, which the United Nations accepts.</p>
        <p>The United Nation's Middle East envoy, Terje Roed-Larsen, arrived tonight to work with Lebanese officials on resolving their contradictions into an official position that helps end the conflict. For if Lebanon does not accept the withdrawal, it signals guerrilla groups that the violent fight against Israel is still on.</p>
        <p>''The key at the end of all of this is Lebanon has to accept our determination,'' said Timor Goeksl, spokesman for the United Nations forces here. ''Then we will be able to move to the border zone.''</p>
        <p>Today, Hezbollah moved into the border zone, planting its yellow flags atop such formerly Israeli-controlled sites as the Beaufort Castle overlooking northern Israel. Lebanese families, with picnic baskets, poured into the area, too, digging through the rubble of the abandoned posts as if they were archaeological sites.</p>
        <p>Some were giddy with re-orientation. ''I am staring down into Misgav Am, Israel,'' said a reporter for a local radio station. ''I can see the asphalt on the road. And the houses. Look, there's people walking there. Israelis! It's really amazing, you know.''</p>
        <p>Contrary to appearances, as the fighters rode Israeli armored personnel carriers along mountain roads, the Lebanese Army recovered most of the weapons and equipment left behind in the hasty pullout, Mr. Goeksl of the United Nations said.</p>
        <p>Granting the resistance fighters their moment of glory, President Emile Lahoud of Lebanon sang their praises as he traveled into the southern zone for the first time -- although advance teams distributed posters of the president and Lebanese flags to towns slathered with Hezbollah imagery.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lahoud tried to allay the anxieties of the Christian townspeople of the south, as did several Hezbollah sheiks and United Nations officials. ''Tell your relatives who left the country to come back because the state of Lebanon will protect everybody,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In Qlaia, so long on the fringes of Lebanon, they were not sure whom to believe. The South Lebanon Army's forerunner, the Army of Free Lebanon, was born in the small hilltop town, which long ago allied itself with Israel out of alienation from local Shiite Muslims and out of fear that Palestinian radical groups would use their town as a base.</p>
        <p>The residents mingled in the church courtyard this morning after Hezbollah rode through their town shooting in the air. One woman said she had shivered with each shot, but another, Josephine Nahara, who was shouted down as she talked, said: ''I thank them. It will be nice to see Muslims and Christians holding hands.''</p>
        <p>The sky-blue dome of the chapel is riddled with bullet holes, and the paint peels off the forlorn walls. Father Salameh, cradling a cell phone in his black cassock, said he was struggling to assess the town's fragile situation.</p>
        <p>''A large part of the town has left,'' he said. ''Imagine having 50 percent of your population emigrate in one day. There were three kinds: Officers and soldiers of the South Lebanon Army, who left for obvious reasons, and people who had worked in Israel, who feared they would be imprisoned.''</p>
        <p>''How can one explain what happened in this town?'' he continued. ''It was the situation of war that warped us and debased us. By the end, the people were cut off from Lebanon, and serving Israel was the only way to make a wage. But it's clear now that Israel used them. Look at those who fled across the border. They have put them in camps, in tents.''</p>
        <p>The priest jumped to his feet as Lebanese Army officials strode into his church unannounced, their first foray into the area in 22 years. The officers talked quietly with the priest, telling him that the people should not worry about reprisals. And then they were gone.</p>
        <p>''We'd be happier if the army stayed,'' Father Salameh said. ''Who's to stop the Palestinians from coming in and causing problems across the border?''</p>
        <p>Here in Merj 'Uyun the villa of Antoine Lahad, the South Lebanon Army chief, was trashed. In Israel, Mr. Lahad faced a bruising confrontation with his troops, who harangued him for the humiliating way in which they were forced to flee their homes. Lebanese television showed a clip of the confrontation.</p>
        <p>In the town of Hasbeya, the Rafa family, many of whom served in the South Lebanon Army, hope that those who stayed in Lebanon will not be treated like collaborators or agents. ''We love that we are Lebanese,'' said Gamal Rafa, 30, who served seven years with the Israeli-backed militia. ''But the wars here made us crazy. We grew up on guns. Guns were muscles. And in this area, the guns were in the hands of the S.L.A.''</p>
        <p>''We were poor,'' he said. ''The only work was their army. If you're in their army, you can live. If you're not, you can't.''</p>
        <p>When he learned that the occupation zone had folded, Mr. Rafa, who quit the militia four years ago to pump gas, set off to track down his cousins who were militiamen. They were still obediently standing at their posts. He took them to his house, dressed them in civilian clothes, and then drove them to an army checkpoint and turned them in.</p>
        <p>''If they're in prison for a month or a year, I can still see them,'' he said. ''If I didn't take them in, maybe they would have been tempted to go down to Israel. And that would be the saddest end to our story.''</p>
