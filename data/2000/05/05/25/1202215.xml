        <p>The stock market ended a five-day slide yesterday as investors bought many of the technology stocks that had been battered since the Federal Reserve raised its short-term interest rate target a half percentage point last week.</p>
        <p>But the fear of higher interest rates, and the threat of how much they could slow the economy in the months ahead, continued to hurt companies that traditionally fare poorly when growth slows.</p>
        <p>So Intel, down 9.8 percent in the last week, rose 6.8 percent. Microsoft, off 8.2 percent, jumped 3.8 percent; Cisco Systems, lower by 16.5 percent in the last week, climbed 9.1 percent; Veritas Software, off 10.3 percent, rose 12.4 percent; and Sun Microsystems , down 17.8 percent, rallied, 6.3 percent. But Sears, Roebuck dropped 3.5 percent; International Paper, 3.6 percent; Dow Chemical 2.2 percent; and Union Carbide 2 percent.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index rose 106.06 points, or 3.4 percent, to 3,270.61, but after falling almost 6 percent Tuesday, the index is still below the 3,321 level it plunged to in the week ending April 14, when the index fell a record 25.3 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 113.08 points, or 1.1 percent, to 10,535.35, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index finished 25.19 points, or 1.8 percent, higher at 1,399.05</p>
        <p>But there is so much uncertainty in the market right now that it is impossible to tell whether one day's rally means anything more than investors switched from one sector to another.</p>
        <p>The abandonment of technology stocks in mid-April helped lead to a big rally in economically sensitive stocks as investors, instead of fleeing the stock market, just moved their money to another sector. But since the Fed's interest rate increase last Tuesday, stocks in this sector have been tumbling.</p>
        <p>''The stock market bulls believe you have 50 basis points or less; the market bears believe you have 100 to 150 basis points more to go,'' said Thomas M. Galvin, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, referring to how much higher the Fed will push short-term interest rates. A basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point.</p>
        <p>''Until we get some data points to shore up confidence that the economy is slowing down, sellers will win the day,'' Mr. Galvin said. And, he added, it will probably not be until June 13, when May retail sales are reported, that there is a chance for a report that could confirm that consumers are slowing down. April retail sales fell 0.2 percent, but no one puts much stock in one month's numbers.</p>
        <p>The uncertainty about the outlook for the stock market and the economy is also increasing the daily volatility of trading. Barely a day goes by without big swings up and down, even if the market ends up little changed on the day. Yesterday, for example, the Nasdaq index was down almost 122 points, or 3.9 percent, before rallying. From the low for the day to the close, the index rose 7.5 percent.</p>
        <p>In the bond market, prices rose as the stock market fell earlier in the day. But as the stock market climbed back into positive territory, bonds gave up their gains as some investors switched from bonds back to stocks. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note rose to 6.46 percent, from 6.42 percent on Tuesday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 9/32, to 100 8/32. The yield on the 30-year bond rose to 6.19 percent from 6.16 percent.</p>
        <p>One of the interesting stock rallies yesterday was in Microsoft, which rose 2 3/8 to 65 9/16, which means the company is worth just a little more than a half of what it was at its high in December. The rally came even as the federal judge trying the Microsoft antitrust case seemed to suggest in a court hearing yesterday that the government's plan to break up the company did not go far enough.</p>
        <p>Results of yesterday's Treasury auction of two-year notes:</p>
        <p>(000 omitted in dollar figures)</p>
        <p>High Price: 99.772  High Yield: 6.749%  Low Yield: 6.650%  Median Yield: 6.720%  Accepted at low price: 70%  Total applied for: $30,049,011  Accepted: $14,838,111  Noncompetitive: $1,743,951  Interest set at: 6 5/8  The 2-year notes mature May 31, 2002.</p>
