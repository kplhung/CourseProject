        <p>Nothing about the reflecting glass exterior of DEI Inc. offers a clue that inside is an exalted garage built to harvest the fastest 720-horsepower beasts in stock car racing.</p>
        <p>Yet starstruck pilgrims in shorts and T-shirts know that this Brobdingnagian race shop with unexpectedly elegant touches was built by Dale Earnhardt, stock car racing's career money winner, and that behind its doors, homage is paid to the deities of speed.</p>
        <p>They arrive in cars, vans and motor homes to gaze at a complex created by Earnhardt and his wife, Teresa, for their three team drivers -- including Dale Jr., who has won two Winston Cup races this year -- and to tour the 8,000 square feet devoted to a showroom and gift shop brimming with souvenirs like Earnhardt caps, Earnhardt robes and Earnhardt Monopoly games.</p>
        <p>''This is my temple,'' Nick Smith, a carpet layer from Newburgh, Ind., said last week, raising his arms to the ceiling of the $15 million racing shop dubbed the Garage Mahal.</p>
        <p>''Some of my friends came here last year and said, 'You definitely have to come here,' '' Smith said. ''I've been a fan for 15 or 16 years. He's just Earnhardt. The Intimidator. He's the man.''</p>
        <p>The splendor Earnhardt has created would be unrecognizable to past drivers for Nascar, or the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, like Earnhardt's father, Ralph, Junior Johnson and Fireball Roberts. But so would nearly all the other one- and-two-story racing shops in Mooresville.</p>
        <p>As auto racing heads into its biggest weekend of the year -- with not only the Indianapolis 500 taking place on Sunday, but Nascar's Coca-Cola 600 at nearby Lowe's Motor Speedway as well -- tens of thousands of fans will converge on what has become home to the nation's largest cluster of Nascar race shops.</p>
        <p>The passing of the grease-monkey image here in the booming suburbs north of Charlotte mirrors Nascar's growth into a juggernaut with total revenues of $1.56 billion this year, according to Paul Kagan Associates, the media research firm.</p>
        <p>That includes sponsors paying millions of dollars to tack their names on cars and races, retail sales of more than $1 billion in licensed merchandise and new TV deals worth $400 million annually.</p>
        <p>Tracks in Florida, Texas, Nevada and California opened recently to exploit Nascar's popularity. New speedways near Chicago and Kansas City will open next year, while speculation continues about a track that may be built in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Everything in Nascar starts with four-speed Chevy Monte Carlos, Ford Tauruses and Pontiac Grand Prix that are assembled, fileted, reassembled, engineered, tested, painted and covered with logos at shops like Earnhardt's.</p>
        <p>The shops, including those not associated with Nascar, employ 1,444 workers in Mooresville, more than any other local industry. This former textile mill town saw its last plant, one that made denim for Burlington Industries, close last summer.</p>
        <p>By then, Mooresville had reinvented itself as Race City USA because of the 24 Nascar race shops that fabricate vehicles for 32 drivers on Nascar's Winston Cup, Busch Grand National and Craftsman Truck circuits.</p>
        <p>''As the mills died, the shops gave Mooresville the identity it needed and an economic engine for growth,'' said Jack Cathey, an accounting professor at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, who publishes an annual Zagat-like guide and rating service for Nascar shops.</p>
        <p>Once, Mooresville believed that tourists would come to the town of 18,000 to vacation on Lake Norman. ''Everybody thought that was the attraction of the future,'' said Dan Wallace, executive director of the Mooresville/South Iredell Chamber of Commerce. ''Then came the racing business. Who knew?''</p>
        <p>The town and county have never offered tax or financial incentives to lure the race shops to Mooresvile. They just kept coming.</p>
        <p>The concentration of shops has made it common to see families and tour groups enter Lakeside Park (make a left at the Chick-Fil-A on Route 150) to make the rounds of 12 Nascar race shops, another dozen shops unrelated to Nascar, and the North Carolina Auto Racing Hall of Fame. Tourism soars in the days before the Winston Cup races at Lowe's Motor Speedway, 15 minutes away in Concord, N.C.: the Coca-Cola 600, which takes place Sunday night; the Winston, which was run last Saturday; and the UAW-GM Quality 500 in October.</p>
        <p>Insurance concerns kept all but a few shops from offering behind-the-scene tours, where visitors could see a dozen or more cars per driver in various stages of construction. Tourists are left to admire cars from behind viewing windows or they get only as close as a lobby with souvenirs and race-used cars.</p>
        <p>Everett Brooks was examining one of Ricky Rudd's No. 28 Texaco/ Havoline Fords last week at Robert Yates Racing.</p>
        <p>''It's just a fascination,'' said Brooks, a retired machine shop supervisor from Petersburg, Va., who was making the rounds of shops for the first time in three years. ''I like to see what's new. It's unbelievable. Half the shops that are here now weren't here then.''</p>
        <p>Rudd, who owned the shop before selling it to Yates last year to refocus on driving, said his one regret in designing the shop in 1994 was not offering the fans a viewing window. ''In hindsight, I would have let them look in,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Next door, fans quietly watched Roush Racing mechanics tend to Mark Martin's and Jeff Burton's Fords for the Winston.</p>
        <p>Soon after Dale Earnhardt Jr. won the $500,000 prize for first place, a pedestrian walkway outside Lowe's Motor Speedway collapsed, injuring more than 100 people leaving the 175,000-seat stadium.</p>
        <p>Among the fans who journeyed here for the race was Tom Bowen, a construction worker from Battle Creek, Mich., on a Nascar holiday.</p>
        <p>''Compared with seeing these cars on TV, this is the only chance to see them up close,'' said Bowen, wearing a Dale Earnhardt Jr. T-shirt. ''Being this close to things I've seen all my life is amazing. My father raced '55 Chevys and he hated Dale Earnhardt. But he's getting old now.''</p>
        <p>Fifteen years ago, Lakeside rejected two owners of race shops who wanted to relocate to the hilly business park. ''We were unfamiliar with racing and thought they'd be dirty, with wrecked cars out front,'' said Cecile Ebert, the park's president and owner. ''Turns out you can eat off the floor of these garages.''</p>
        <p>Ebert now comprehends the full meaning of Nascar: 60 percent of Lakeside's 170 businesses are racing related. And even if nearby Concord is offering incentives for shops to relocate, she's certain teams will stay in Mooresville for its low-key lifestyle and its proximity to interstate highways, airports and Lowe's Motor Speedway and other Southeastern tracks.</p>
        <p>Rudd said: ''I live on the lake seven miles away, so when I was looking to build a shop, I wanted to be nearby. And my wife has a knack for real estate.''</p>
        <p>Felix Sabates Jr., whose Team Sabco is led by the Winston Cup drivers Sterling Marlin and Kenny Irwin, said Mooresville's shops are too crucial to the local economy to lose to rival cities like Concord.</p>
        <p>''Iredell County won't let them take anybody away,'' said Sabates, who has more than doubled the size of his complex since moving to Lakeside in 1995.</p>
        <p>''Our first shop could have fit in here,'' he added, gesturing from behind a massive desk to his massive second-floor office.</p>
        <p>Dennis Berken, a carpenter from Fox Valley, Wis., walked respectfully through the trophy room of Penske Racing South, Rusty Wallace's shop, which lets fans peer into the working garage. ''I took three days off to see the shops and go to the race,'' he said. ''This is as close as we've ever gotten to the cars.''</p>
        <p>Berken, who lives near Green Bay, is a Packers fan. ''They'd never let you this close to a practice field,'' he said. The behemoth of Mooresville is Earnhardt's elegant 176,000-square-foot complex. He doesn't drive for DEI -- racing instead for Richard Childress, out of Welcome, N.C. -- but he is the undisputed icon here, a regular presence to employees, occasional visitors and fans admiring his and his drivers' trophies, their race-winning cars and his knife and boat collections.</p>
        <p>DEI has a dining room that resembles a gentleman's club, red velvet elevator walls, cream-colored carpeting and an array of ceilings with reflective tiles, gold medallions and polished wood. ''That comes from my wife's experience as an interior decorator,'' Earnhardt said.</p>
        <p>Visitors can also watch a loop of his TV commercials or buy his leather jackets, diecast miniatures of his No. 3 GM Goodwrench Chevrolet, backpacks and energy bars.</p>
        <p>But he will not permit fans to view the mechanics at work. ''These guys work hard, and to have interruptions is no good,'' he said. ''They're doing a job and they have business to do. I didn't build this to give tours.''</p>
        <p>Not every race team can afford a $15 million shop. MB2, which owns Kenny Schrader's M&amp;M's Pontiac, is in a hangar-like shop too cramped for its production needs.</p>
        <p>''The building doesn't make you go faster,'' said Jay Frye, the general manager of MB2, which is contemplating a new, larger home in nearby Concord.</p>
        <p>''So we don't use our building as an excuse. We see a lot of great buildings and when you look at the points standings, we're higher.''</p>
