        <p>Last weekend was a time for favorites to finish second. That is not a reference to the Preakness but to the New York final of the Grand National Teams, which was played on Sunday at Honors Club, at 115 East 57th Street in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Richard Schwartz, Michael Polowan, Zia Mahmood, David Berkowitz, Adam Wildavsky and Robb Gordon, who between them own bunches of open national titles, were leading into the final quarter of the match by just 4 imps. Their opponents, Jeff Aker, Brady Richter, Barry Rigal, John Solodar, Alex Ornstein and Sue Picus, were, judged by reputations, due to lose, but they prevailed by 22 and will represent New York in the national playoffs in Anaheim, Calif., in August. Picus is one of the few women who have won this prestigious New York title.</p>

        <p>Last weekend was a time for favorites to finish second. That is not a reference to the Preakness but to the New York final of the Grand National Teams, which was played on Sunday at Honors Club, at 115 East 57th Street in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Richard Schwartz, Michael Polowan, Zia Mahmood, David Berkowitz, Adam Wildavsky and Robb Gordon, who between them own bunches of open national titles, were leading into the final quarter of the match by just 4 imps. Their opponents, Jeff Aker, Brady Richter, Barry Rigal, John Solodar, Alex Ornstein and Sue Picus, were, judged by reputations, due to lose, but they prevailed by 22 and will represent New York in the national playoffs in Anaheim, Calif., in August. Picus is one of the few women who have won this prestigious New York title.</p>
        <p>A key deal from the match is shown in the diagram. Richter, West, opened with a weak two-bid and led from his spade suit against South's three no-trump. South won with dummy's jack and played a club to the jack, losing to the queen. West led a second spade to dummy's ace, and South persevered with clubs. West took his ace, cashed the diamond king and exited with his remaining club.</p>
        <p>South was now cut off from dummy's hearts and had to fail by a trick. He would have done better to take his top hearts at the fourth and fifth tricks. Then he could have put West to the test by leading a low club from his hand. West would have had to rise with the ace, cash the diamond king, and exit with his last club. Playing low would have given South the chance to win with the 10 in dummy, cash two heart winners and lead a club to endplay West.</p>
        <p>In the replay, Rigal played in the same contract from the North position and received a diamond lead. West won with the king and shifted to a heart, making the diamond position clear.</p>
        <p>Declarer solved his problem by taking the ace and king of hearts, finessing the spade jack, and cashing three more major-suit winners before leading a club. Since West had only black cards he was helpless. North could not be prevented from making nine tricks, and in practice emerged with 10 for a gain of 10 imps.</p>
        <p>The first declarer could have succeeded in similar fashion, by unblocking hearts immediately, but that was not obvious since he had no information about the diamond position. The Aker team gained 12 imps, more than half the eventual margin of victory.</p>
