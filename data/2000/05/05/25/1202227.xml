        <p>It has been a tough sell, finding a town willing to take in New York City's garbage.

        <p>It has been a tough sell, finding a town willing to take in New York City's garbage. But after four years of rejections, New York has finally found a place that is not just willing, but eager: Linden, N.J., a blue-collar town across the waterway from the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island.</p>
        <p>''There's no downside,'' said John T. Gregorio, Linden's mayor, of plans to build a waste transfer site with a capacity of 10,000 tons a day. ''The barges will pull in and the trains will pull out. You won't hear it, see it, smell it, and we make $4 million or $5 million.''</p>
        <p>No downside? To some of Linden's neighbors, the plan to haul millions of tons of New York's garbage through New Jersey by rail has nothing but downsides.</p>
        <p>Three weeks ago, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani held a news conference to announce the plan, a major component of which is the barging of 6,400 tons of garbage a day to Linden. It will then be packed into containers, sealed and taken by train to Midwestern and Southeastern landfills owned by the private company that won New York City's 20-year $6 billion garbage contract.</p>
        <p>New York City had been looking for places willing to take its 13,000 tons a day of household garbage since 1996, when Mayor Giuliani announced that Fresh Kills, the world's largest landfill, would close by the end of 2000.</p>
        <p>Despite the money that the city was dangling -- thousands or millions of dollars a year, depending on the size of the station, along with jobs and increased property taxes -- several New Jersey municipalities in heavily industrialized Middlesex and Union Counties said no, thanks.</p>
        <p>''Residents feared it would smell,'' said Joseph E. Ryan, a spokesman for the Bayonne mayor's office. ''They didn't want the train traffic it would bring.''</p>
        <p>And like residents of Middlesex County, other Union County municipalities do not want their town mottos to be ''The Garbage Runs Through It.''</p>
        <p>But where others saw bad smells and jokes, Linden saw cash: $2.5 million a year, plus 50 new jobs and increased property taxes. The Linden City Council unanimously approved the garbage port in February, two years after Browning-Ferris Industries, which won New York City's contract, approached Domenick Pucillo, owner of the 50-acre site on the Arthur Kill, about obtaining a 20-year lease for the garbage barge port. (Mayor Gregorio did not vote or participate in discussions on the topic because he is Mr. Pucillo's father-in-law.)</p>
        <p>''The area we're talking about has been contaminated by heavy industries,'' said Richard Gerbounker, a Linden councilman. ''You're not going to put pristine industries there. That's why the garbage is so attractive.''</p>
        <p>Linden's industrial section -- more than 600 asphalt-covered acres, sandwiched between the Arthur Kill and the New Jersey Turnpike -- has  oil refineries, huge oil and gas tanks and chemical plants. The closest  homes are nearly two miles away, and most residential neighborhoods are four or five miles away.</p>
        <p>''You can live in Linden all your life and unless you work at the factories, never come here,'' Mayor Gregorio said.</p>
        <p>During the 60's and 70's, Linden's refineries and processing plants employed 100,000 workers on three shifts. But many of those plants, like  Exxon's and DuPont's, are now closed. Eventually the diners and taverns that served the workers went dark as well. The city's population declined from 45,000 in the early 1970's to 37,600.</p>
        <p>''What do they want us to do, not use the industrial site?'' Mr. Gerbounker asked.</p>
        <p>In Middlesex County, Kathy Crusco, whose Metuchen home overlooks one of the rail lines where the garbage train might run, is not worried about Linden's property values. ''I didn't buy a house on a landfill, but now they're proposing to build one on wheels,'' she said. ''Why drag us down, just because they're not as nice a town as us?''</p>
        <p>Metuchen is eight miles south of Linden, but it is a different world. Its 13,000 residents have an average family income of $70,000, nearly double Linden's. It is almost entirely residential. There is no industry, unless you count a few storage units. And now it is likely that garbage trains leaving Linden will be passing through this quiet town, and Metuchen will not see a penny more for the town's budget because of it.</p>
        <p>The garbage trains leaving Linden will pass through Middlesex and Somerset Counties. One of the two possible routes skirts the backyards, parks and school athletic fields of Metuchen, Woodbridge and South Plainfield. The mile-long garbage train will travel the route twice a day, pulling out of Linden full and returning empty.</p>
        <p>Metuchen is no stranger to train traffic. About 15 freight trains a week pass through town, including some that carry chemicals and hazardous materials, said Bob Libkind, a Conrail spokesman.</p>
        <p>But Metuchen just dislikes the very idea of taking in New York City garbage. ''We recycle our trash,'' said Pat Russell, a substitute teacher and longtime Metuchen resident. ''Why can't New York take care of its own trash?''</p>
        <p>Ed O'Brien, the mayor of Metuchen, asked: ''Why doesn't Giuliani send his garbage through New York State? Why not barge it all the way down to Virginia? They say it will cost too much? Well, that's not our problem.''</p>
        <p>New Jersey residents living along the route of the garbage train are mustering their forces to fight it. But under federal commerce regulations, they are powerless to stop it.  Their only hope is to try to persuade the agencies to reject it.</p>
        <p>But to their dismay, politicians and environmentalists are not taking up their cause. This contrasts with the situation two years ago, when Mayor Giuliani announced a plan to haul garbage to Union County waste transfer sites. He had informed Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of the proposal less than 24 hours before. Her response was a press release titled,  ''Whitman to New York Garbage Plan: Drop Dead.''</p>
        <p>This time, New York City's administrators approached Governor Whitman months before and kept her aware of their plans.</p>
        <p>Though Governor Whitman has not endorsed the Linden port, she has expressed approval of some of its safeguards, like closed barges designed to keep trash out of New Jersey's waters, said her spokeswoman, Jayne O'Connor.</p>
        <p>Rob Schmitt, a spokesman for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, expressed sympathy for residents who might soon see garbage trains chugging past their living room windows every day.</p>
        <p>''It's absolutely heartbreaking for them, and we realize that inside the department,'' he said. ''But they're looking for assurances nobody can give them. Nobody can guarantee there will never be a train accident or spill. God knows, they don't want solid waste. But we can't tell New York City not to bring their trash here.''</p>
        <p>The barge-to-rail plan of transporting garbage also has the support of some environmental organizations, including the Natural Resources Defense Council and the Tri-State Transportation Campaign, an environmental coalition.</p>
        <p>New Jersey is already living with New York garbage, said Kristen Fountain, a spokeswoman for Tri-State. As Fresh Kills closes down, more and more trucks are being added to the hundreds hauling trash to New Jersey waste transfer sites each day as a temporary solution until permanent waste sites are approved.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, nobody wants garbage, but it doesn't look like they have much of a choice,'' Ms. Fountain said. ''They can either live with one train or 500 more trucks. If the alternative is trucks, then a train is a much better option.''</p>
        <p>But Mayor O'Brien said he did not want New York City's garbage, period, whether in trucks or trains. Other Middlesex County Freeholders and municipal mayors agreed, but said they could not decide on ways of stopping the Linden barge port until Browning-Ferris submits its plans to Union County.</p>
        <p>''Is Linden ready to be called the garbage capital of the world, or at least the East Coast?'' Mayor O'Brien asked. ''There's Detroit cars, Pasadena roses, now Linden garbage? Have they thought about what this will do to their real estate values?''</p>
        <p>But Linden is a place where substances far more dangerous than garbage have been handled, from mercury to World War II-era military poisons and Hellcat fighter planes. The garbage port might even increase real estate values by keeping taxes down, Mayor Gregorio said.</p>
        <p>''We may even be able to have a decrease,'' he said. ''This is going to put us in the butter tub.''</p>
        <p>But, he added, he felt sorry for the people living near the rail lines. ''I would do the same thing they're doing if I were in their place,'' he said.</p>
