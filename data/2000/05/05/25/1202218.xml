        <p>Vice President Al Gore said today that the stock market was an attractive place for Americans to invest over the long run but that it was the wrong place to seek a solution to Social Security's problems.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Gore reiterated his strong opposition to Gov. George W. Bush's proposal to allow individuals to invest part of their Social Security payroll taxes on Wall Street. And he defended his own decision to back away from his early support for allowing the government itself to invest in stocks on Social Security's behalf. He said that his shift was driven by a recognition that allowing the government to become a big shareholder would create problems and that the stock market had not generated as consistently strong returns as he had once assumed.</p>
        <p>''The learning experience that we went through convinced all of us that it was a bad idea,'' Mr. Gore said of government investment in the market.</p>
        <p>Tracing the evolution of his thinking about Social Security and the financial markets, Mr. Gore said that he had kept an open mind to many possible solutions to the retirement system's problems when the Clinton administration began examining the issue in earnest a few years ago.</p>
        <p>Last year the administration proposed a plan, backed by Mr. Gore, under which the government would begin channeling hundreds of billions of dollars in additional money into Social Security out of general tax revenues starting in 2011. Under the plan, half of the new money going to Social Security would be invested by the government in stocks, up to a maximum of 15 percent of Social Security's total reserves.</p>
        <p>The administration dropped the plan last year in the face of intense opposition from Republicans, revived it in its budget proposal early this year, then dropped it again as it became clear that Social Security would be one of the most heatedly debated issues of the presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign has sought to use Mr. Gore's on-again, off-again support for government investment in the stock market to undermine the vice president's assertions that Social Security benefits should not be dependent on Wall Street. And Mr. Bush's aides said Mr. Gore's reversal on the issue suggested that he was prepared to sacrifice principles to make a short-term political point.</p>
        <p>''There is a growing sense that Al Gore has never had a conviction which he could not easily change,'' said Ari Fleischer, Mr. Bush's spokesman. ''He was clearly on record as advocating and supporting government investment in the market. Now he's walking away from something he advocated as recently as 1999.''</p>
        <p>Some advisers to Mr. Gore said the vice president had dropped his support for government investment in part to make it easier for him to attack Mr. Bush's approach.</p>
        <p>But in the interview, on the porch of his home on the grounds of the Naval Observatory, Mr. Gore sought to play down the degree to which he had supported the concept, and said that in any case he had changed his mind as he learned more about the tradeoffs it would require.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said he had been swayed in part by criticism of the idea from Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Mr. Greenspan opposed the plan on the grounds that politicians would not be able to resist using the government's role as a shareholder to favor or punish certain industries or to meddle in corporate decisions.</p>
        <p>''The magnitude of the government's stock ownership would be such that it would at least raise the question of whether or not we had begun to change the fundamental nature of our economy,'' Mr. Gore said. ''Upon reflection, it seemed to me that those problems were quite serious.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Gore said, he became convinced that Wall Street's ups and downs were large enough to create a risk that the government might be making a bad investment. During long stretches -- including from the late 1960's to the early 1980's, Wall Street was by no means the one-way bet it has often been viewed as in recent years.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Gore receives income from some stock technically owned by his mother, he owns no stock, and has never actively invested in the market. He said he had chosen to stay out of the market when he first was elected to Congress in 1976 to avoid any conflicts of interest, not out of fear of risk, and that he supported a variety of proposals to promote savings and investment.</p>
        <p>But he said investment in the markets should ''come on top of Social Security,'' rather than as a replacement for it. And he said that Mr. Bush's economic policies, including his big tax cut and his need to use much of the Social Security surplus to pay for the creation of private accounts, would undermine the fiscal discipline that has helped propel the markets upward in recent years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's approach ''contains the seeds of its own destruction by virtually guaranteeing a weaker economy, and thus, you would expect, a weaker market, with lower returns than what we've seen in these boom years,'' Mr. Gore said.</p>
        <p>THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: SOCIAL SECURITY  Correction:  May 26, 2000, Friday  An article yesterday about Vice President Al Gore's position on Social Security misstated one element of his personal finances. Mr. Gore receives no income from investments in the stock market. Although his financial disclosure form lists dividend income, the stock is held in trust for his mother, and the income goes only to her.</p>
