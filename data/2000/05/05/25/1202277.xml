        <p>The crucial hockey game was scoreless until 8 minutes 34 seconds were left. That is when Claude Lemieux, the biggest money player in Devils history, took center stage in a game in which his team faced elimination from the playoffs.</p>
        <p>As he did so many times in leading the Devils to their Stanley Cup triumph in 1995, when he was named the tournament's most valuable player, Lemieux scored an important goal tonight as the Devils defeated the Flyers, 2-1, at Continental Arena to force a deciding seventh game in the Eastern Conference finals. The teams will play Friday night in Philadelphia, where the Devils have won twice in this series.</p>
        <p>The Devils, who snapped the Flyers' five-game road winning streak, are trying to become the first team to come back from a 3-1 deficit to reach the Stanley Cup finals.</p>
        <p>Tonight's intense battle featured the return of Eric Lindros, who scored the Flyers' goal with 30 seconds to play after missing a score by a fraction of a second as the second period ended.</p>
        <p>Lemieux's goal, a backhander from the left side in the crease after a shot by Bobby Holik, broke the scoreless tie. Lemieux had stolen the puck to set up Holik's shot. Alexander Mogilny's backhander with 2:27 left, which sailed over the glove of Flyers goaltender Brian Boucher, proved to be the game-winner.</p>
        <p>Lindros, playing for the first time since March 12 because of concussions, scored from a crowd in front of goaltender Martin Brodeur.</p>
        <p>Lemieux tried to give as much credit to his teammates as possible after the game. ''This was a team effort, not a one-man show,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Lemieux gave plenty of credit to Jason Arnott's line, with Patrik Elias on the left wing and Petr Sykora on the right, for creating so many chances.</p>
        <p>Lemieux also cited Mogilny. ''Alex got a big goal for us,'' Lemieux said. ''I know he wanted a goal badly, and his goal ended up the winning goal.''</p>
        <p>The rest of the Devils also tried to spread the credit around. The bottom line is that they have revived themselves after three consecutive losses, when everyone took them for dead, to reach Game 7, in which anything can happen.</p>
        <p>''Everyone counted us out when we went down, 3-1,'' said Coach Larry Robinson, whose tirade after the Game 4 loss here sparked his players. ''We dug ourselves a hole and we're trying to get out of it.''</p>
        <p>Robinson sounded as if his team had the advantage going into Friday's game. ''We've been facing Game 7 since Game 5,'' he said. ''We've got to keep going. They've had tomorrows. Now we both don't have tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>The Devils were the better team tonight, taking 26 shots against Boucher, while allowing only 13 against Martin Brodeur. The Devils were particularly dominant in the second period, when they limited the Flyers to just two shots. ''We didn't forecheck well and didn't get on top of them,'' Flyers Coach Craig Ramsay said. ''We lost the edge to them from the second period.''</p>
        <p>Ramsay said he was pleased with Lindros's performance. The towering Lindros led the Flyers with three shots in 14:47 of action. Robinson used Steve Kelly, John Madden and Randy McKay against Lindros's line. Lindros's first big play in the game was a crunching check against Lemieux in front of the Devils' bench midway through the opening period.</p>
        <p>The Flyers got a bit of a scare with 2:02 left in the first period when a shot by Scott Gomez wedged in Boucher's mask and apparently stunned him. The goalie went down quickly, threw his glove away and grabbed his mask in pain. He had another brilliant save against Holik 62 seconds into the third period.</p>
        <p>But there wasn't much Boucher could do on the goals by Lemieux and Mogilny.</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>JOHN MADDEN returned to action for the Devils much sooner than expected. He missed three games after bruising his right knee in Game 2 of the series. . . . SERGEI NEMCHINOV, who sustained a cut that required 40 stitches on his forehead near the left eye in Game 5, missed the game because he could not wear a helmet. . . . With ERIC LINDROS returning, the Flyers sat PETER WHITE, the son-in-law of BOB CLARKE, the president and general manager of the Flyers.</p>
