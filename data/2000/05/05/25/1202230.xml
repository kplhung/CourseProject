        <p>HEREWITH a new installment of the occasional ''Let's Get Real'' column, to examine two political puzzles: 1) Why, despite broad support for softening the state's harsh drug laws, have they remained on the books? And, 2) why do both of New York's Senate candidates say they want to tighten campaign finance laws, even as they raise and spend the old-fashioned way?</p>

        <p>HEREWITH a new installment of the occasional ''Let's Get Real'' column, to examine two political puzzles: 1) Why, despite broad support for softening the state's harsh drug laws, have they remained on the books? And, 2) why do both of New York's Senate candidates say they want to tighten campaign finance laws, even as they raise and spend the old-fashioned way?</p>
        <p>1. The drug laws.</p>
        <p>These inflexible laws, with their mandatory minimum sentences, rob judges of discretion and send nonviolent drug users, including small-time sellers and users, to prison for at least 15 years.</p>
        <p>The human toll is daunting, dramatically documented in The New York Times by Matthew Purdy in columns about people being separated from their families, spending decades behind bars, longer than convicts serving minimum sentences for manslaughter or rape.</p>
        <p>Relaxing the laws is not a radical concept. Those who say they favor some change include Gov. George E. Pataki, Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver, the Senate majority leader Joseph L. Bruno, Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye, the New York State Catholic Conference and the Legislature's Black and Puerto Rican Caucus.</p>
        <p>Even many of the state's powerful district attorneys say they support narrow change. They maintain, however, that unjust sentences are rare, note that the governor can always grant clemency to correct injustice, and contend that the strict drug laws have helped reduce crime.</p>
        <p>What the district attorneys do not say is that revisions in the drug laws would have to come at their expense. At present, because the charge automatically determines the sentence, the district attorneys have added power to extract plea bargains and information that incriminates others.</p>
        <p>But even the prosecutors would support the governor's limited proposal to allow some defendants to ask the Appellate Division for modest sentence reductions.</p>
        <p>Last year, the governor tied his proposal to a measure to end parole for nonviolent felons. Mr. Silver balked. This year, Mr. Pataki resubmitted his bill, but many lawmakers say that the speaker, ever protective of Democrats from heavily Republican areas, is wary of election-year charges that his party is soft on crime.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what that means when such a cross-section -- liberals, conservatives, Democrats, Republicans -- know it is time to reform these laws,'' said Assemblyman Michael J. Bragman, a Democrat from the Syracuse area (2-to-1 Republican) and leader of the recent coup attempt against Mr. Silver. Mr. Bragman wants a floor debate on the drug laws.</p>
        <p>Fine idea, but in Albany, getting a bill passed means making a deal. What will Mr. Pataki want in exchange for agreeing on a bill, and will Mr. Silver give it to him? Or will it be yet another performance of the Albany dance in place?</p>
        <p>You get three weeks to find out. Then lawmakers begin their summer vacations.</p>
        <p>2. Campaign finance.</p>
        <p>Last year and in 1998, Representative Rick A. Lazio of Long Island joined with just a quarter of the House Republicans to vote for the Shays-Meehan ban on soft money -- the unlimited and largely unregulated donations to parties that are intended to skirt limits on direct donations to candidates. (The bill failed in the Senate.)</p>
        <p>THIS week Mr. Lazio, now the presumptive Republican candidate for Senate, dismissed the call from Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign for a voluntary ban on spending soft money in their race -- a proposal few in politics ever thought Mrs. Clinton meant seriously -- as ''ridiculous'' and ''incredible.'' Said Mr. Lazio: ''They've already spent over $1 million. Now they want to close the door and say we can do it but no one else can?''</p>
        <p>He sure has a point. Mrs. Clinton, another ostensibly strong champion of changes in campaign finance, has raised $12.8 million so far in ''hard money'' and an unknown amount in ''soft money'' and independent money (spent by organizations like unions). Give some of that up? Candidates always want every penny.</p>
        <p>And entering the race so late, Mr. Lazio couldn't afford to accept voluntary limits -- politically or financially. That would mean offending Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the prominent foe of changing campaign finance laws who heads the Republican committee that doles out money to Republican Senate candidates.</p>
        <p>So mutual disarmament is not about to happen, to no one's surprise. ''Everyone always finds a reason for not doing it,'' said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, which promotes public campaign financing. ''If they don't want to do it.''</p>
