        <p>Chuck Knoblauch had two hits in the middle of an explosive Yankee comeback tonight, his contribution to a badly needed 12-4 victory over the Chicago White Sox. But inside, Knoblauch was seething in the last two innings, frustrated after his throwing jitters caused another brutal error. And afterward, Knoblauch suggested that he will quit baseball if he cannot conquer his mental block.</p>
        <p>''I don't need this,'' he said. ''I'm not out here for the money. I'm out here to have fun. I don't need the money. I don't need this. The money is not keeping me here. The competitiveness is keeping me here. I mean, I know I can play. This isn't about money at all; it's never been about the money. But everybody has a breaking point.''</p>
        <p>Is Knoblauch close to the breaking point? ''Pretty close,'' he replied.</p>
        <p>With two outs in the eighth, Chris Singleton hit an easy grounder to second base, where Knoblauch fielded the ball; as he began to make what should have been a routine throw, anxiousness seized him, as it has so often since the middle of the 1998 season. Knoblauch's throw covered little more than half the distance to first baseman Tino Martinez and rolled far to Martinez's right into foul territory. Knoblauch removed his glove and started to throw it in disgust. He turned to watch the replay of his error on the screen.</p>
        <p>Fans at Comiskey Park responded with a roar, and the rest of the night, they jeered Knoblauch, some of them standing and cheering every time he threw successfully to first as part of his warm-ups before the bottom of the ninth inning.</p>
        <p>''I certainly don't need the frustration,'' said Knoblauch, a Gold Glove winner in 1997 who made 26 errors (14 throwing) last season and is on a pace to make about that many this year. ''I don't need it. I know baseball is a small part of life, but when you're playing it, it's a big part of life. It's what we do.''</p>
        <p>Knoblauch's throwing problem was dormant in spring training and in the first month of the season. But he said that after he suffered a wrist injury, he lost the rhythm he had developed. ''Yeah, I'm concerned about it,'' he said. ''I'd be an idiot not to be concerned about it. You've got two choices: you keep going out there or you take it to the house.''</p>
        <p>As in, go home. Manager Joe Torre said he will be concerned about Knoblauch's throwing problems ''only if he is'' and reiterated that what Knoblauch has brought to the Yankees in the total package -- his leadoff skills, his ability to generate runs -- has helped the team win two championships. Torre made his comments before Knoblauch spoke to a handful of reporters after the game.</p>
        <p>The Yankees had 13 hits over the last three innings, 18 in all, a season high. Paul O'Neill blew the game open with a three-run double, Jorge Posada had three hits and two runs batted in, and Andy Pettitte (3-2) pitched seven innings. Derek Jeter, the Yankees' shortstop, who is coming back from a strained abdomen, took batting practice in Tampa, Fla., and could return to the lineup Saturday.</p>
        <p>It looked as if the Yankees' slump were going to deepen. It looked as if the Yankees were going to lose their fourth straight tonight. Bernie Williams attempted to make a sliding catch of a Jose Valentin's line drive in the third inning but missed, and the ball rolled behind him. Valentin wound up with a triple that increased Chicago's lead to 2-0. In their 42nd game, the Yankees were at their lowest point in the season, their offense moribund, their frustration mounting, losing again, some players believing privately that the team needs an injection of talent.</p>
        <p>Frank Thomas came to bat, and the Yankees' infield moved in with only one out. Another hit and the Chicago lead would be three runs. But Pettitte whipped a fastball over the inside corner and fooled Magglio Ordonez for a strikeout. A spark.</p>
        <p>The Yankees scored their first run against Mike Sirotka in the fourth inning, and Pettitte kept shutting down the White Sox, glaring in for the signs from Posada, the brim of Pettitte's cap casting a shadow over his face.</p>
        <p>Shane Spencer drew a walk to open the sixth, and Posada blasted a high drive to left -- grimacing when it curled foul just before reaching the pole. Then Posada grounded into a double play and that could have convinced the Yankees of a luckless fate.</p>
        <p>But trailing by a run, they picked at the White Sox in the seventh. Scott Brosius coaxed a leadoff walk and Jim Leyritz, pinch-hitting for Ricky Ledee, took a couple of close pitches and also drew a walk. The hard-throwing Bob Howry relieved Sirotka. The left-handed-hitting Lance Johnson pinch-hit for Clay Bellinger.</p>
        <p>When Johnson turned to bunt, some White Sox fans who remembered his days in Chicago might have snickered: Johnson was a bad bunter then and now, and he popped a ball foul that first baseman Paul Konerko nearly reached. Johnson stepped out, looking to the third-base coach, Willie Randolph.</p>
        <p>The bunt sign was off, and with the White Sox infield aligned in bunt defense, Johnson bounced a single through the middle, scoring Brosius with the tying run. It was as if Johnson's hit severed a tension cord wrapped around the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch slammed a single; another run scored. Williams lined a single to right, loading the bases. Howry was out for the White Sox; Bill Simas was in. But O'Neill swung at a Simas fastball and lowered his head, the way he does when he knows he has crushed the ball.</p>
        <p>As O'Neill's drive soared to left-center, outfielders in pursuit, Johnson retreated to third to prepare to tag up, Knoblauch moved halfway between second and third, and Williams rounded second, waiting as in a picket line -- until O'Neill's liner slammed against the fence. Johnson ran home standing, and Knoblauch did, too, beckoning Williams with a wave of his hand, not knowing that Williams was sliding across the plate right behind him. The Yankees' dugout came alive with high-fives and shouts.</p>
        <p>Two batters later, Posada blistered a line drive down the right-field line, and it slammed against the foul pole. A home run, a fitting finish to a seven-run inning, after his long foul ball the inning before.</p>
        <p>Knoblauch made his throwing error in the eighth, and in the top of the ninth, he lined a single. But he was angry, furious about the throwing problem. ''I don't need this,'' he said, over and over.</p>
