        <p>In the tests, which were conducted this month, the parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, were asked individually if they played direct roles in the 1996 killing, and if they knew who killed JonBenet.

        <p>The parents of JonBenet Ramsey released the results of polygraph tests today that they said should remove any suspicion that they were involved in the killing of their 6-year-old daughter.</p>
        <p>In the tests, which were conducted this month, the parents, John and Patsy Ramsey, were asked individually if they played direct roles in the 1996 killing, and if they knew who killed JonBenet. Mrs. Ramsey was also asked if she wrote the ransom note found in the Ramsey house in Boulder, Col., where JonBenet's body was discovered. Both denied any involvement in their daughter's death.</p>
        <p>The polygraph did not register any deception, said Edward I. Gelb, the Los Angeles-based expert who administered the tests.</p>
        <p>Chief Mark Beckner of the Boulder police said that he would review the test results, but that ''nothing has changed the way this case will be investigated.''</p>
        <p>JonBenet was found beaten and strangled on Dec. 26, 1996.</p>
