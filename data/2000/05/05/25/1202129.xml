        <p>TWO original residents of Westbeth -- the grand experiment in subsidized artists' housing that opened in 1970 -- sat side by side on a planter in front of the entrance. One had a long graying beard and a brown fedora; the other was missing some teeth and wore a fisherman's hat.</p>
        <p>Like them, Westbeth is showing its age.</p>
        <p>The buildings, which wrap around Bethune and West Streets, look seedy: the Corbusian curved balconies seem to be rusting away; the industrial metal windows whistle; the inner courtyard is bleak. The fountain on the outer courtyard has been cemented over.</p>
        <p>Yet, on its 30th anniversary, Westbeth is poised to reclaim its original vision. As the oldest tenants die or move out, a new wave of artists are taking their place. A recent residential rent increase, sanctioned by the federal agency that controls the property, paid for much-needed roof and sidewalk replacement. Long-term commercial leases with rents at a fraction of current market rates -- in one case, $4 a square foot versus $20 now -- are about to expire, clearing the way for Westbeth finally to earn some real money.</p>
        <p>And on the artistic front, the Westbeth Gallery, which is a showcase for tenants' work, has begun a retrospective series that some artists say has sparked creative fervor.</p>
        <p>''People are just now starting to rethink what it is Westbeth should be doing,'' said Jack Dowling, a resident for 22 years and the new director of the gallery. ''There's a lot of stuff happening here now.''</p>
        <p>With real estate agents buzzing around the West Village like angry hornets in search of a place to land, Westbeth residents, who pay $350 to $650 a month for lofts with 13-foot ceilings, can count themselves among Manhattan's luckiest: something comparable nearby runs at least $2,000 to $3,000.</p>
        <p>When artists first applied, rents were as low as $99 a month. In those idealistic days, a lot of things were taken on faith -- like the applicants' verbal agreement with the interviewing committee that, after a few years, they would move out, clearing the way for struggling new artists.</p>
        <p>Everyone nodded and smiled. Hardly anyone left.</p>
        <p>''You'd be a fool to move out, with these rents and this location,'' said George Cominskie, a photographer's agent who moved in 17 years ago to join his partner, an artist, and remained when his partner left. Now, the tenants' council is debating hiring a full-time social worker to address the needs of elderly artists.</p>
        <p>''When it was conceived, we hoped Westbeth would be a way station, an incubator,'' said Joan Kaplan Davidson, whose family foundation, the J. M. Kaplan Fund, helped create Westbeth and who served as its first president. ''Artists would get established and move on. That hasn't always happened.''</p>
        <p>A 13-building complex with 383 apartments, Westbeth was the novel idea of Roger Stevens, the first chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, and Jacob M. Kaplan, a Manhattan philanthropist who had made his money from grape juice. In the late 1960's, the two elderly men combed the city for a site that could be converted into subsidized lofts for artists to live and work in. They ultimately found a whole block: the vacant shell of the famous Bell Telephone Laboratories, where color television and the transistor radio were developed.</p>
        <p>They hired Richard Meier, a friend of Mr. Kaplan's son and, at 33, an architect looking for his big break. Seed money from the Kaplan Fund, plus a 3 percent, $12 million mortgage from the Housing and Urban Development Department, would finance the conversion. Artists would be vetted, and any tenants whose income rose above the limits would pay a surcharge. HUD would regulate, advised by an ''insider'' council of artists-residents.</p>
        <p>Within two years, the adaptation was finished, and the critics were ecstatic. On May 10, 1970, Ada Louise Huxtable, then the architecture critic of The New York Times, wrote that Westbeth ''bent (but did not break)'' almost every bureaucratic rule and called Mr. Meier's conversion ''exemplary.'' In an interview last week, Ms. Huxtable said Westbeth, which remains the largest artists' live-work complex in the world, seemed at the outset ''virgin, beautiful: both the dream and the architecture.''</p>
        <p>But Westbeth at 30, while still innovative in many ways, is no longer so innocent.</p>
        <p>There have been 19 suicides, some tenants say, starting with Diane Arbus, who slit her wrists in her loft a year after Westbeth opened. In a 1995 documentary video, ''Westbeth Growing Up,'' by Allison Prete, one resident called the place ''Death-beth.'' Ms. Prete, who grew up there, taped children of longtime tenants complaining of Westbeth's ''dark side,'' which included walking to school past bodies of people who had thrown themselves from the roof.</p>
        <p>In interviews, others spoke of the ''combustibility'' and ''volatility'' of tenants with artistic temperaments living side by side. They point to the lawsuits: within the last decade, T.U.C. Management, which runs the building, has paid out more than $1 million in legal fees, a significant chunk of it trying to evict a handful of tenants who didn't pay their rent or who carried out illegal alterations, and defending the building when these tenants countersued. HUD threatened to foreclose on the property several times, because so many tenants were behind on their rent.</p>
        <p>Westbeth has not always been in such turmoil.</p>
        <p>When the first residents moved in, many left their doors open in the spirit of community. Artists came together over potluck dinners; dancers worked out, in the courtyard. But that kind of love fest ended after a rent increase was imposed in the mid-1970's, and some tenants mounted a rent strike.</p>
        <p>Some of that animosity lingers, aggravated by a mid-1980's plan to raise money by turning the building into a co-op. The co-op proposal, which would have allowed tenants to buy their apartments at low prices, was narrowly defeated.</p>
        <p>Despite the wrangling over financial matters, Westbeth is in many ways a success. There is a 10-year wait for apartments, which under the rules can be rented only to low- and middle-income artists and their families. The current earnings limit is $34,200 for a three-person family and close to $50,000 for a family of six. Artists who earn more after they move in are hit with a surcharge of up to 60 percent. ''There are people earning millions, er, a lot of money,'' said Bradford Winston, president of the management company.</p>
        <p>Yet the atmosphere, many tenants say, is exactly what it was designed to be: conducive to creativity.</p>
        <p>The Merce Cunningham Dance Company, a commercial tenant since 1971, rehearses on the 11th floor. Hans Haacke, a longtime resident, set in motion an art-world shock this spring when his piece for the Whitney Museum's Biennial, ''Sanitation,'' linked Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani to the Nazis. The photographer Evelyn Hofer still lives here. After Joseph Chaikin, the actor and director and a Westbeth resident, had a stroke in 1984, Sam Shepard drove cross-country to welcome him home from the hospital, and the two locked themselves in the bedroom to finish up ''The War in Heaven,'' a monologue subsequently performed by Mr. Chaikin, despite his aphasia.</p>
        <p>''Samuel Beckett came to a reading I gave of 'Texts for Nothing,' '' Mr. Chaikin recalled in a halting voice. ''That was right here in this apartment.''</p>
        <p>Artists of all ages and degrees of career success say that although Westbeth has been a significant part of their creative life, it hasn't eliminated their travails.</p>
        <p>''I haven't been able to make a living doing painting,'' said Barbara Prete, a painter who raised her three children in a 1,100-square-foot loft. She took on freelance writing and editing to bolster her uneven income from art. ''The majority of artists here are still struggling,'' she added.</p>
        <p>And as for the ones who are struggling just to get into Westbeth? ''If you've waited 8 or 10 years,'' Ms.  Prete said, ''you're probably no longer a young artist.''</p>
        <p>BARTON LIDICE BENES, 57, is a collagist who has been assembling found objects in his one-room studio at Westbeth for more than half of his life.</p>
        <p>Although his is not a household name, he has achieved a fair degree of success: a New York gallery represents him and he recently attended an opening of a show of his works in a Swedish castle.</p>
        <p>Mr. Benes is H.I.V. positive, and although his health is fine for the moment, some of his most recent work has death as its leitmotif. Other works stacked in the small space are acid comments on fame.</p>
        <p>Within wooden cubbyholes, he has placed symbols of death -- funerary ashes and other reliquaries. In one slot he has placed a dried rose. The label reads: ''From the Rose Garden, Village of Lidice, Czech Republic, Destroyed by the Nazis, 1942.'' (He was born that year and named after the town.)</p>
        <p>''You wouldn't believe what people send me: Here's a piece of O.J.'s famous glove,'' he said, brandishing a well-worn brown glove sent by Alan Dershowitz, the lawyer. In the master cubbyhole over his desk, where he stores objects before incorporating them into final works, there is a piece of Jamie Lee Curtis's string bikini and a twig from what is said to be the broom that swept Mao's room when he was a student.</p>
        <p>Mr. Benes says he has willed his entire apartment -- a mix of his own work and his friends' and African paintings and masks -- to the North Dakota Museum of Art in Grand Forks, to be installed in the museum as a work of art.</p>
        <p>In the late 1960's, Mr. Benes was eking out his artistic existence in a $400-a-month walk-up apartment on East 18th Street. When he read about Westbeth in The Village Voice, he jumped at the chance, even though that part of the West Village was rife with drug dealers and transvestite prostitutes. At Westbeth, he paid $99 a month. ''We were only supposed to stay five years,'' he said. ''Thank God they never enforced it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Benes doesn't look for trouble; he doesn't sit on any committee or enter the fray of Westbeth politics, which can be rugged.</p>
        <p>''I'm a loner,'' Mr. Benes said. ''I'm friendly, but I'm a loner.''</p>
        <p>''At the beginning, they had big plans -- everyone kept their doors open and everybody loved each other,'' he continued. ''But it doesn't happen that way in life, especially life among artists. I have a nice place to do my work. I'm pretty happy here.''</p>
