        <p>Top officials of the Justice Department and the F.B.I. engaged in an unusual public debate today at a Senate hearing over a 1996 memorandum about whether Attorney General Janet Reno's job was at risk as a result of the government's high-profile investigation into finances of the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>At the Senate hearing, a top official of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Neil Gallagher, said he attended a meeting four years ago with Lee Radek, a senior Justice Department official, who, according to Mr. Gallagher's testimony, said that he was under heavy pressure on the case and that Ms. Reno's job was ''in the balance'' as a result of the inquiry.</p>

        <p>Top officials of the Justice Department and the F.B.I. engaged in an unusual public debate today at a Senate hearing over a 1996 memorandum about whether Attorney General Janet Reno's job was at risk as a result of the government's high-profile investigation into finances of the 1996 Clinton-Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>At the Senate hearing, a top official of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Neil Gallagher, said he attended a meeting four years ago with Lee Radek, a senior Justice Department official, who, according to Mr. Gallagher's testimony, said that he was under heavy pressure on the case and that Ms. Reno's job was ''in the balance'' as a result of the inquiry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Radek, who also testified at the hearing, said that he had no recollection of the meeting but that he was sure he had not made such a remark.</p>
        <p>He dismissed Mr. Gallagher's statement as ''a lie.'' Mr. Gallagher, however, said he was positive of his account of the meeting.</p>
        <p>The disputed comments were referred to in a memorandum written by the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Louis J. Freeh, who was not at the meeting but said that another official had reported Mr. Radek's comments.</p>
        <p>The disagreement between two high-ranking officials reflects the acute sensitivity within law enforcement circles over the campaign finance inquiry that has resulted in guilty pleas and convictions of lower level fund-raisers but has never reached the upper echelons of the Democratic Party or the White House.</p>
        <p>F.B.I. officials, including Mr. Freeh, have long contended that an independent prosecutor should have investigated the case because the Justice Department under Ms. Reno, a presidential appointee, could never be perceived as impartial.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Reno and her top advisers on the independent counsel matters, like Mr. Radek, repeatedly blocked efforts to seek an outside prosecutor, saying the law did not require Ms. Reno to refer the case to an independent counsel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Radek's public integrity unit in the Justice Department has managed the investigation, which Congressional Republicans have long criticized as a tepid effort.</p>
        <p>Republican lawmakers have continued their attacks on Ms. Reno -- even though the independent counsel law has expired -- for her refusal to relinquish the case to an outside prosecutor.</p>
        <p>They have said Ms. Reno deliberately kept the inquiry in-house to spare President Clinton embarrassment and in an effort to keep her job after Mr. Clinton won re-election.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeh's memorandum was read at today's hearing by Senator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican who has led an inquiry into the Justice Department's handling of campaign finance matters.</p>
