        <p>An independent study of Newark schools nearly five years after the state took over operation of the district has concluded that perceptions of the district among parents, teachers and students have improved. But the study turned up no data, other than state-administered tests, to track real improvements in student and staff performance.</p>
        <p>The study, released today by the Community Training and Assistance Center in Boston, did not address the effect, if any, of the recent revelation that under state management the district has run up a $58 million deficit this school year.</p>
        <p>Yet despite the scarcity of hard data on the effect of the takeover, the study's authors said the improved perception of the atmosphere and potential for learning in the 44,000-student district was no small accomplishment.</p>
        <p>The study was paid for by the Committee of Advocates for Newark's Children, a consortium of 30 Newark businesses, foundations and religious and community groups created in 1996, the year after the state took over control of the district amid charges of corruption and mismanagement. The committee has become a defender of the politically unpopular takeover.</p>
        <p>The rancor that accompanied the 1995 ouster of the elected school board and installation of a state-appointed superintendent has remained a feature in the city's life and has threatened to hobble efforts to make changes. That anger has been aggravated by the superintendent's sudden departure last year for a job out of state and the recent revelations of poor bookkeeping.</p>
        <p>But the study found that those surveyed ''believe that the district is supplying more support to students, teachers and principals and holding all those involved to a higher standard of involvement.''</p>
        <p>''These are all results much to be desired, and counter the perception in some quarters that the public and the educators do not see any improvement as a result of the takeover,'' the 89-page study said.</p>
        <p>District officials who had been briefed on the study did not return calls seeking comment.</p>
        <p>William Slotnik, executive director of the research and training group that conducted the study, said results of state-administered tests indicated that performance of the district's elementary and middle school students had improved significantly.</p>
        <p>Twenty percent of district students showed ''clear competence'' on 1998 reading tests administered statewide to eighth graders, compared with 15.8 percent in 1995. (The statewide average is 54.3 percent.) Similar gains were made in math scores, but writing competency scores actually declined in the district.</p>
        <p>There have been no meaningful data on student achievement from  year to year, either before or after the state takeover, giving education planners no way of determining what had worked and what had not, Mr. Slotnik said. In many cases, students have been given annual standardized tests, but the scores have never been organized and maintained to allow any analysis or planning, the study said.</p>
