        <p>The caseload in Brooklyn's criminal courts nearly doubled in April compared with the same month last year largely because of the huge number of arrests in a sweeping Police Department antinarcotics plan, and court officials are expressing fears that the case backlog may get out of hand.</p>
        <p>According to the Office of Court Administration, the criminal courts in Brooklyn handled 5,694 misdemeanor cases in April 1999. But this April, just three months after the antinarcotics plan, known as Operation Condor, went into effect, the number of misdemeanor cases had jumped to 10,470, officials said, an increase of almost 84 percent.</p>
        <p>''Everybody is weary,'' said Judge William Miller, who oversees the criminal courts in Brooklyn, which, unlike the borough's Supreme Court, handle only misdemeanor cases. ''I can't say that this hasn't created conflict, but we try to remain optimistic and manage the caseload. Still, it's very difficult work.''</p>
        <p>Operation Condor, which began on Jan. 17, was conceived as an effort to flush the narcotics trade from drug-ridden neighborhoods by flooding the streets with undercover officers. The program, which had resulted in 38,968 arrests through yesterday, was recently broadened to include a crackdown on quality-of-life offenses and to address the rash of killings of livery-cab drivers.</p>
        <p>The effect of Operation Condor on the Brooklyn criminal courts was first reported on Monday in The New York Law Journal. The report said the antidrug program had had its most severe impact in Brooklyn, noting that misdemeanor caseloads during the same period rose 0.8 percent in Manhattan, 23 percent in the Bronx, 25 percent in Staten Island and 40 percent in Queens.</p>
        <p>Marilyn Mode, a spokeswoman for the Police Department, said that court officials had been given fair warning that Condor was likely to increase courtroom traffic.</p>
        <p>''We have heard that caseloads have gotten heavier in Brooklyn,'' she said. ''But we've also heard that it's nothing that they can't handle.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, judges, court officers, prosecutors and defense lawyers all said that Operation Condor had made their lives more harried by increasing their work.</p>
        <p>Michael F. Vecchione, the first deputy district attorney in Brooklyn, said it was nearly impossible for his trial lawyers to keep up with the flood tide of arrests. ''Condor has killed us, absolutely killed us with the backlog,'' Mr. Vecchione said. ''Once the police started making hundreds and hundreds of arrests, the system backed up.''</p>
        <p>According to Judge Miller, judges who handled a daily calendar of 75 to 80 court proceedings before Operation Condor was established are now working on as many as 140 hearings a day. He said that the courts had added several sessions just to manage the influx of arraignments, which are defendants' initial appearances before a judge after being arrested, and that many judges were working until 8 p.m.</p>
        <p>The increased caseload has also affected the court officers who escort defendants from holding cells to courtrooms, Judge Miller said. ''What you have is officers transporting defendants through elevators and hallways,'' the judge said. ''It's a big operation under normal circumstance. With Operation Condor, it's only gotten worse.''</p>
        <p>Court administrators say Operation Condor has only added to the strain. The total police force, they noted, has soared to a record 40,000 from 26,432 in 1976, while the number of criminal court judges in the city has remained roughly the same since the mid-1970's.</p>
        <p>There has also been a similar shortage of publicly financed lawyers, said Susan Hendricks, the deputy chief of the criminal division for the Legal Aid Society. Ms. Hendricks said that Legal Aid lawyers in Brooklyn were assigned nearly 5,000 new cases from February through April because of arrests attributed to Operation Condor.</p>
        <p>''With Condor the police got millions of dollars for overtime and now they're asking for more,'' Ms. Hendricks said. ''We didn't get a single extra penny and it's been a big problem. I don't have any money to move people around.''</p>
        <p>''When you talk to individual lawyers in Brooklyn, they tell you that they're feeling tremendously overworked and pressured,'' Ms. Hendricks continued. ''Now, when you look at the data, you understand exactly why that is.''</p>
