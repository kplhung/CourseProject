        <p>A police detective found dead yesterday at a Staten Island cargo terminal killed himself, the police said.</p>
        <p>They said they had conducted an intensive search Tuesday night after the detective, Heriberto Mercado, 32, had an emotional telephone conversation with the mother of his 7-year-old son in which he apologized for speaking harshly to the boy. The woman, alarmed because he sounded distraught, called the police.</p>
        <p>Yesterday afternoon, a man picking up equipment at the Howland Hook Marine Terminal found the detective's body in his station wagon, the police said, adding that his detective's shield was on a chain around his neck, his gun was in his hand, and there was a note on the dashboard.</p>
        <p>Detective Mercado, who worked undercover with the Brooklyn North narcotics unit, was involved in the March 31 slaying of two teenagers who tried to rob him and another detective with pistols that turned out to be realistic toys. The detectives were cleared of wrongdoing.</p>
