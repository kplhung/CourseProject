        <p>IT was the smell I missed the most. That delicious, woodsy, slightly acidic odor that flooded my memory with images of printing presses and the ratcheting clatter of teletype machines and the sight of a newsroom littered with cups of stale coffee and lazy clouds of swirling cigarette smoke.</p>
        <p>I know. I know. Newspapers now have separate printing plants. Teletype machines have long been gone. And smoking is a major no-no.</p>
        <p>But those feelings and memories, caught up in the smell of newsprint, were what I  missed the most in the past five months. On Jan. 1, as an experiment, I canceled my newspaper subscriptions. I usually read a local weekly, a local daily and, from the newsstands a few times a week, The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal.</p>
        <p>I stopped buying all of them. I wanted to see how well I could stay informed by reading news only online or on my handheld Palm organizer or ''Web enabled'' wireless phone.</p>
        <p>I also limited my exposure to regular television news during the experiment. I'd occasionally catch the network news and snippets of my local news while I ate dinner. I frankly didn't miss television at all. But then, even though I work in television, I have seldom watched it. Television is too passive. I just don't have time to stop everything and sit still for a TV newscast.</p>
        <p>From Jan. 1, until recently, I surfed the Web several times a day, reading the electronic editions of my regular papers and several others.</p>
        <p>Let me tell you: For a guy who has devoted the last few years of his professional life preaching new media and the Internet, I am amazed at how frustrated I was without my printed newspaper.</p>
        <p>I missed it. The crinkly feel of it. The sheer enjoyment and relaxation it brought me when I would sit in my big, comfy blue leather chair and read it by a crackling fire. I can't tell you how many times I wished I had had it with me in the bathroom, too.</p>
        <p>All those things are subjective. I guess I'm a lot more of a touchy-feely guy that I thought I was.</p>
        <p>On an objective level, in terms of the main goal of my decidedly unscientific but personal experiment, I can say with certainty that after five months of consuming only online news, I didn't miss very much.</p>
        <p>I read all I wanted and then some about Elian. I probably have a better sense of the ups and downs of the markets because of the immediacy of online market coverage. I know about the corrupt cops in Los Angeles. I'm well aware that Rudy Giuliani has prostate cancer and that Matt Drudge released the e-mail addresses of 300 reporters.</p>
        <p>But still, there was this gnawing concern that I had somehow missed something. For five months I had this vague, restless worry that I was ignorant. Online news left me unsatisfied. Incomplete.</p>
        <p>Every day I would try to read -- if that's what scrolling up and down a computer screen can be called -- the online editions of The New York Times and The Washington Post, as well as CNN.com, ABCNews.com and the Web edition of my local papers, The Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News.</p>
        <p>I subscribed to a free news-alert service from MSNBC that beeps and flashes a little red dot on the computer screen whenever major news breaks. The Saturday morning that Elian was taken by immigration service agents, the beeping woke me up and I trudged in the dark to my home office to read, at 5:50 a.m., what all the commotion was about.</p>
        <p>I used a service called AvantGo to download news from a variety of other sources directly onto my Palm handheld computer. The only time I found it worthwhile was when I was on an airplane, jammed in the middle seat between two huge businessmen. There was no room to turn the pages of a real newspaper, let alone a magazine.</p>
        <p>So I whipped out my Palm and, with my arms all scrunched together, tap-tap-tapped with the stylus to make my way through the news I had downloaded before leaving home. The guy on my right wasn't very happy. ''Do you have to keep making that noise?'' he grumbled. There was the slightest little beep every time the stylus hit the scroll bar, and it apparently kept him from sleeping. On my shoulder. Tough. I kept tapping.</p>
        <p>I also tried reading online news on a wireless Qualcomm phone billed as Web-enabled. It was ridiculous. The screen is so small that at best, you can read half a headline. ''Firefighters race'' (turn the thumb-wheel) ''high winds'' (turn the thumb-wheel) ''in Los Alamos'' (turn the thumb-wheel) ''blaze.''</p>
        <p>Whew. To read the morning paper on one of these is to risk a repetitive stress injury to the thumb. Besides, as with the Palm VII wireless communicator that I also experimented with, it often took three to four minutes to make a wireless connection to the news server, then a couple of minutes longer to download the Web pages. By then, it was barely news anymore. I don't have the patience for wireless news.</p>
        <p>Here's what I couldn't get online:</p>
        <p>* Local news: Even though I read the online editions of the local papers, they didn't feel local. I had to really hunt to find articles of local interest. On a computer screen, with just links of a uniform size for  navigating, there is a lack of perspective about what's important. And it's often hard to distinguish between local and world news on a computer screen. My wife, who is very new to the Internet, never did get the hang of finding local news. ''It's all a big jumble,'' she said, clicking off the Net in disgust one night. I sometimes had to resort to printing out articles from the online edition of my local paper to appease her.</p>
        <p>* Serendipity: I really missed the surprise of a newspaper. Leisurely turning the pages of a newspaper and finding delightful, fascinating little articles that are just, well, there. Articles I just ran across, instead of having to click on. Sometimes I found that online. But not often. I logged on for quick hits of information and then clicked off. Reading on the Web may be called ''browsing,'' but it always seemed hurried to me.</p>
        <p>* Advertising: This was a real issue with my wife. She missed several big sales at the local department store. Flower Day at the local farmer's market happened without her this year. Newspaper coupons that would have saved her money at the supermarket went unclipped. I am convinced that this is why newspapers need not worry about becoming extinct. Advertising is more than just ads. Coupons are a sort of currency. Advertising is just as much news as a bylined article. I don't think I ever found a banner ad on an Internet site that interested me enough to click on it.</p>
        <p>* Convenience: There is no getting around the fact that reading news online is cumbersome. You have to sit down at a computer, log on to the Net and click and scroll, all the while sitting in a chair that is not nearly so comfortable as the easy chair out in the family room. Online is too formal, I have decided. With a newspaper, it's right there. Put it down. Go to the fridge for a Diet Pepsi. Come back. Pick it up. Put it down. Stuff it in your briefcase. Rip out an article and paste it on the family bulletin board.</p>
        <p>*Impact: This is tough to describe. Somehow, I remember stuff better when I read it on paper. That is probably the result of my conditioning and may not be a problem with younger people raised on the Net. But with a newspaper, it's easier to go back and reread an article that you saw last week, if it hasn't been used to wrap up the garbage or been tossed in the recycling bin. I bookmarked some interesting Web articles, but they were never as easy to find as my stack of newspapers used to be. And whenever I used to look at the stack of newspapers piled on the lower shelf of the end table in my family room, I felt secure, deep down, that if I needed information, it was there.</p>
        <p>Again, this experiment was personal and anecdotal. I have resubscribed to my old papers, starting June 1. I can't wait to walk down the driveway at sunup once again, serenaded by the birds, and pull the morning daily out of the bright yellow tube next to my mailbox.</p>
        <p>The first thing I'll do is put it to my nose and inhale. Deeply. Maybe, if I'm lucky, it will even leave a familiar black smudge on my nose.</p>
