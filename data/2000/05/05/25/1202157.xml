        <p>Priceline.com, which earned its reputation with the name-your-own-price model for airline tickets, will soon try to interest you in bidding for a new commodity: cheap phone calls.</p>
        <p>The company began its Priceline Long Distance Service yesterday. Consumers can go to the company's Web site (www.priceline.com) to bid on blocks of long-distance time. Bids are accepted or rejected within 60 seconds.</p>
        <p>After their bids are accepted, consumers use the Priceline credit as they would use any prepaid phone card. The customer first dials a toll-free number, then enters a password and begins using the time, which has already been charged to the customer's credit card. (Consumers don't have to change their primary long-distance carriers.)  ''We wanted to boil down all the complicated long-distance pricing schemes to a simple equation: no hidden charges, no monthly fees, no minimum call times,'' said Daniel Schulman, Priceline's president and chief executive.</p>
        <p>One way the company is trying to keep the service inexpensive is by routing calls over the networks of Internet telephony companies: Net2Phone, deltathree.com and zeroplus.com. Mr. Schulman said that during about a month of testing, the average block of time sought by each bid was four hours and that the average saving was about 40 percent off the best available long-distance packages.</p>
        <p>James Vogtle, e-commerce research director at the Boston Consulting Group, said the Priceline service could mean savings for consumers, even beyond those offered by other carriers. ''The ong-distance market is a commodity market with lots of surplus capacity,'' Mr. Vogtle said. ''Consumers just might get better prices than they would be able to negotiate on their own.''</p>
