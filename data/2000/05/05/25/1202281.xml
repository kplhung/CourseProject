        <p>In the latest sign that Major League Baseball is cracking down on unruly behavior by players, the commissioner's office yesterday fined and suspended 19 members of the Los Angeles Dodgers for leaping into the stands and brawling with fans at Chicago's Wrigley Field last week.</p>
        <p>The players union denounced the suspensions as intolerable, and the Dodgers, who complained about lax security and drunken fans in the brawl's aftermath, said in a statement that the players would appeal them.</p>
        <p>Rich Levin, a spokesman for Commissioner Bud Selig, said the 19 suspensions are believed to be the most in history stemming from a single baseball brawl.</p>
        <p>Frank Robinson, baseball's new vice president for on-field operations, said he was determined to curb violence on the field.</p>
        <p>''What I'm trying to do with these penalties is say, 'We can't stop you from doing these things but if you do them you have to understand you will pay the consequences,' '' he said in a telephone interview.</p>
        <p>The commissioner's office will decide when the suspensions will be served, if they are upheld. Robinson said the suspensions would be staggered, with no more than three players banned for a single game.</p>
        <p>Robinson said there had been far too many incidents this season in which players have charged the pitcher after being hit by a ball, igniting benches-clearing brawls.</p>
        <p>On April 27, Robinson suspended 16 members of the Detroit Tigers and the Chicago White Sox for a total of 82 games after the teams started fighting when a batter was hit by a pitch.</p>
        <p>''That doesn't belong in baseball,'' said Robinson, who was hit by balls 198 times in his 21-year career as a Hall of Fame outfielder and, he said, never charged the pitcher.</p>
        <p>The fight at Wrigley was particularly disturbing, Robinson said, because players went into the stands. For days, people around the country viewed televised reruns of players attacking people who paid to see them. It was not the sort of image baseball officials want to project.</p>
        <p>The Wrigley brawl on the night of May 16 -- during the ninth inning of the Dodgers' 6-5 victory over the Cubs -- began when a fan who was evidently drunk reached over the chest-high infield wall near the bullpen, hit Chad Kreuter, a catcher, in the back of the head and then snatched his cap. Kreuter had been sitting with the pitchers with his back to the fans along the first-base wall.</p>
        <p>Kreuter and several teammates chased the fan and ended up trading punches with several fans, while the rest of the team stood watching the melee. It took stadium security officers nine minutes to restore order.</p>
        <p>Kreuter was suspended for eight games, as were Coaches Glenn Hoffman, Rick Dempsey and John Shelby. Fifteen other players received suspensions for between three and five games. All nineteen were fined as well, but baseball officials declined to say how much.</p>
        <p>''The penalties are just intolerable,'' Gene Orza, a high-ranking official with the players union, said. ''What would have happened to these players if they didn't do anything? What would their reputations within the sport have been? I don't know a manager or general manager who wouldn't have fired them.''</p>
        <p>In a statement, the Dodgers said: ''Although we fully accept and support the notion that fans belong in the stands and players belong on the field, we are extremely shocked and concerned about the severity of the punishments.''</p>
        <p>''I would have been disappointed if we hadn't protected each other,'' Kevin Malone, the Dodgers' general manager, told The Chicago Sun-Times the day after the incident. ''It's a product of intoxication and overindulging in alcohol.''</p>
        <p>Dodgers Manager Davey Johnson said yesterday, ''My whole coaching staff was trying to keep our people from getting smoked.''</p>
        <p>The day after the melee, the Cubs increased security around the bullpens, and the Dodger-Cubs afternoon game was played without any fan-related incidents.</p>
        <p>Levin, the Major League Baseball spokesman, said the players would continue to play until their appeals are heard by Paul Beeston, baseball's president and chief operating officer. It remained unclear last night how long that process would take, but Robinson said he hoped to finish it within two weeks.</p>
        <p>Nine of the players suspended were pitchers. Carlos Perez and Mike Fetters will be forced to sit out four games, while Terry Adams, Darren Dreifort, Eric Gagne, Onan Masaoka, Alan Mills, Antonio Osuna and Chan Ho Park will be suspended for three.</p>
        <p>Officials also suspended four outfielders -- F. P. Santangelo, Gary Sheffield, Geronimo Berroa and Shawn Green -- as well as first baseman Eric Karros and catcher Todd Hundley.</p>
        <p>Three fans involved in the fight were charged with disorderly conduct and another fan, who ran onto the field earlier in the game, was charged with trespassing.</p>
        <p>Although the suspensions were evidently unprecedented in scope, they were not unforeseen.</p>
