        <p>A day after Marcus Camby allowed Austin Croshere to beat him along the baseline and Latrell Sprewell was too busy preening and posturing toward Reggie Miller to prevent Jalen Rose, his man, from dunking, Jeff Van Gundy sounded off.</p>
        <p>The Knicks' coach did not lambaste his players, but he implied that kind of effort embodied a lackadaisical team effort.</p>
        <p>''This is team defense,'' Van Gundy said. ''Marcus got beat on a baseline drive by Croshere that he has the ability to stop. Some of the other ones, they were good plays on their part but there were some team defensive breakdowns.</p>
        <p>''The one we would all like to have back is the play at the end of the first quarter where we sort of stopped,'' Van Gundy said of the play in which Croshere put back a long air ball at the buzzer.</p>
        <p>''The second one we would like to have had back is after Latrell cut it to three,'' Van Gundy said of the dunk. ''Those are plays where you didn't go as hard as you need to go. I'm not talking about just Marcus and just Latrell.</p>
        <p>''Latrell didn't go back as hard as he could back to get Rose, but there are four other guys on the floor that could have gotten back to prevent stuff like that. Those type of baskets, when you are playing a great team like Indiana, you can't afford to give them. You should never be outworked.''</p>
        <p>Kind Words From Miller</p>
        <p>News flash: Reggie Miller finally complimented a Knick employee.</p>
        <p>The All-Star Pacer said that Jeff Van Gundy is the best between-game adjustment coach in the league today.</p>
        <p>''I got him a few shots in the All-Star Game,'' Van Gundy said of Miller. ''Well, I really do think adjustments, that term is vastly overrated. It is not like we are going to come tomorrow with the same mindset as we had in Game 1 and come with a different plan and be any better.''</p>
