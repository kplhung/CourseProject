        <p>Letter from Kenneth R Burns on his unsuccessful use of DOS Copy command to back up his files to CD</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Regular backups are indeed good medicine, but CD-R drives have their perils. I used DOS's trusty Copy command to back up all my files to a CD, and I restored them after calamity struck. Sadly, my computer was still unusable because CD-R's are read-only after they are burned, so each restored file also was set as read-only. Eventually everything was fine, but I might have avoided frustration had I used backup software instead of the DOS command.</p>
