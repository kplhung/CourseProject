        <p>Trees in New York City must deal with a host of nuisances: car exhaust, dog waste and, recently, the dreaded Asian long-horned beetle. Now, they are increasingly facing another threat: exotic vines brought by immigrants generations ago that are smothering and strangling acres of oaks, maples and other native hardwood trees.</p>
        <p>''There's an endless tangle of these vines, which are suppressing and crowding out everything else,'' said Dr. William Schiller, a botanist at the American Museum of Natural History. ''They've been here for quite a long time, but the impact is escalating steadily. It takes awhile for an aggressive plant to take over large areas to the point where people notice it, but now it's obvious to just about anybody who's out of doors.''</p>

        <p>Trees in New York City must deal with a host of nuisances: car exhaust, dog waste and, recently, the dreaded Asian long-horned beetle. Now, they are increasingly facing another threat: exotic vines brought by immigrants generations ago that are smothering and strangling acres of oaks, maples and other native hardwood trees.</p>
        <p>''There's an endless tangle of these vines, which are suppressing and crowding out everything else,'' said Dr. William Schiller, a botanist at the American Museum of Natural History. ''They've been here for quite a long time, but the impact is escalating steadily. It takes awhile for an aggressive plant to take over large areas to the point where people notice it, but now it's obvious to just about anybody who's out of doors.''</p>
        <p>To confront the problem, the city is using a $2 million federal grant to hire 20 new Parks Department employees to cut back the encroaching vines. A City Council hearing is scheduled for this afternoon to discuss the damage and possible ways to deal with the exotic vines.</p>
        <p>The most harmful varieties are the Japanese honeysuckle, the porcelain berry, the climbing bittersweet and wisteria. All are ornamental, and some probably escaped from residential gardens decades ago, said Marc A. Matsil, chief of the natural resources group of the city's Parks and Recreation Department.</p>
        <p>The vines can be found in nearly every patch of parkland in the city, Mr. Matsil said, and they have killed thousands of trees, as well as shrubs, flowers and other plants. In some places, like the woodsy swaths bordering Mosholu Parkway and Thomas Pell Wildlife Refuge in the Bronx, the vines have grown over patches the size of a city block, blighting everything beneath them.</p>
        <p>''It looks like a huge eerie mugging,'' Dr. Schiller said.</p>
        <p>Some vines, like the Japanese honeysuckle, climb up the trees, trying to reach the sunlight, and wind up blanketing branches and leaves, blocking the sun and eventually smothering the trees, along with shrubs and wildflowers beneath them. Others, like the bittersweet, strangle the trees by girdling them in ever-tightening, ever-thickening circles -- damaging older trees and killing saplings, the new generation.</p>
        <p>The city uses some herbicides to kill vines, Mr. Matsil said. But mostly, workers simply chop them down. It is more a matter of controlling the vines than eradicating them, he said.</p>
        <p>Vines spread gradually into wooded areas, starting from the edges. Smaller clumps of trees, like the ones in Riverside Park, Prospect Park and numerous other city parklands, are most vulnerable, Mr. Matsil said. The vines have difficulty penetrating into the heart of forests. But if a gap opens up -- as old trees die, for instance -- the vines tend to take advantage of the sunny spot to establish a home base.</p>
        <p>''There's a power struggle always between plants in respect to light,'' Dr. Schiller said. ''Bit by bit, the vines enter the edges of the woodlands. For a vine, all it needs is a tree falling over or a roadside space. Then the vines go in and wreck things.''</p>
