      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Personal Health Column on May 9, about the 40th anniversary of the birth control pill, referred incorrectly to the number of women who have taken the pill since its introduction in 1960. The exact number is unknown. Johns Hopkins University has estimated that 80 percent of American women born since 1945 have used oral contraceptives at some time. The erroneous figure, 468 million, applied to the number of women who started taking the pill in any given year plus the number of women who continued to use it from the previous year, for a total of 40 years.</p>
