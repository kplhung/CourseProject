        <p>Wayne Chrebet has heard the questions for several years in the mall, on the beach, in other countries. After all this time, it got to be irritating, Chrebet said, trying to explain to strangers exactly how he could sit next to a guy who had once famously and derisively labeled him ''the team mascot.''</p>
        <p>Today at the Jets' minicamp, Chrebet said somewhat convincingly that he wished Keyshawn Johnson, his former nemesis and teammate, well in Tampa Bay, where he was traded last month for two first-round draft picks.</p>
        <p>''I think that stuff went away pretty quickly,'' Chrebet said of the bad feelings that arose from comments made in Johnson's 1997 book. ''We left on good terms. I'm happy for him. What he wanted, he got. He's on to greener pastures, in his mind. We'll adapt to it.''</p>
        <p>Chrebet's adaptation to Johnson's departure will especially be critical if the Jets receivers, as Coach Al Groh hopes, are to fill the gap on offense that Johnson leaves. When Chrebet was signed as a free agent out of Hofstra in 1995, he was viewed as the No. 1 receiver. Now, after four seasons at Johnson's physical, if not emotional, side, Chrebet has emerged again as the Jets' primary target. Although the Jets will most likely pursue a veteran receiver like Cincinnati's Carl Pickens after salary-cap cuts are made June 1, the onus will largely be on Chrebet, along with Dedric Ward and perhaps the rookie Laveranues Coles, to make up for a big chunk of Johnson's receptions.</p>
        <p>''When you have a transition, different people take on different roles,'' Groh said of Chrebet's situation. ''He'll take on some of the things other people did.''</p>
        <p>Last year, Johnson had 89 catches for 1,464 yards. Chrebet, struggling with a foot injury that slowed him even after he missed five games, had 48 catches for 631 yards. But in 1998, when Chrebet was healthy, he tied Johnson for the league lead in most first downs produced with 60. Still, when Johnson left, most people felt that the Jets had lost their best player and that they needed to find another go-to receiver. Chrebet said he did not feel slighted.</p>
        <p>''It would be silly to act like we didn't lose anything,'' Chrebet said. ''I could look at it as an opportunity to be the go-to guy. I came into the league being the only guy and I got pushed aside. I've produced. I feel I'm the No. 1 receiver, but certainly the whole offense has to pick up the slack. We lost a big player in our system.''</p>
        <p>Chrebet smiled throughout, knowing that the questions about Johnson that had dogged him for much of his career might finally end. Only once did Chrebet seem annoyed, when he was reminded of an Internet report in the wake of the Johnson trade that suggested that Johnson was actually a harder worker than Chrebet. One last time, the prickliness about their relationship resurfaced.</p>
        <p>Chrebet does not know the writer, he said, but he wonders if the person ''is at my house every night in the summer at 1 o'clock in the morning running wind sprints or working out during the day.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''I'm not in the position I am because I sit on the couch in the summer. That might be one of the silliest things I've ever heard.''</p>
        <p>EXTRA POINTS</p>
        <p>The Jets signed their fifth-round draft pick, receiver WINDRELL HAYES, and re-signed nose tackle JASON FERGUSON, a restricted free agent. The Jets have signed all of their draft picks except the four first-rounders. . . . Gov. GEORGE E. PATAKI visited the Jets' camp Wednesday as a guest of the owner WOODY JOHNSON. Pataki met the long snapper DENNIS O'SULLIVAN, whose mother, ANN, is an administrative assistant in the governor's office. . . . Linebacker MO LEWIS, who signed a one-year, $4.187 million deal three weeks ago, has not been available for comment.</p>
