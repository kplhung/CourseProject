        <p>As United Airlines officially announced its proposed $4.3 billion acquisition of US Airways yesterday, the two companies began confronting the obstacles and challenges that they will have to overcome.</p>
        <p>To capture US Airways, a prize Wall Street analysts said was a nearly perfect strategic complement, United needs to run a gantlet of federal regulators, rank-and-file members of its unions and its competitors.</p>
        <p>''If I had to bet, I would bet this thing is doable,'' said James Higgins, an airline industry analyst at Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. ''But it is not going to be pretty getting there.''</p>
        <p>James Goodwin, the chairman and chief executive of United's parent, the UAL Corporation, is mindful of the challenges but optimistic about UAL's ability to deal with them.</p>
        <p>''In my opinion, there are two major hurdles,'' said Mr. Goodwin, who will run the combined company. ''The first is to get US Airways shareholders to approve this transaction. I don't think that is a major hurdle. The real work ahead of us is the regulatory work, which revolves around the Department of Transportation, the Department of Justice and the European Union. Our real challenge will be there.''</p>
        <p>Skepticism was apparent on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>Befitting a stock that has received a takeover offer that was about 130 percent above its closing price on Tuesday, shares of US Airways soared yesterday but settled well below the $60 a share that United agreed to pay. US Airways closed at $49, up $23.0625.</p>
        <p>Shares of UAL and those of its main rivals declined. UAL fell $7.1875, to $53.1875. The AMR Corporation, the parent of American Airlines and the company most threatened by the merger, slipped $2.5625, to $30.0625. And Delta Air Lines lost $3.6875, to $51.50.</p>
        <p>Assuming United can meet all the challenges, it will then find itself encumbered with huge amounts of debt -- $7.3 billion in debt and lease obligations from US Airways alone -- obligations that could threaten its financial viability if the economy were to slide into recession sometime in 2001, the year the airline has said it expects the deal to close.</p>
        <p>''The probability of this transaction being consummated is materially less than 100 percent,'' said Samuel Buttrick, an airline analyst at PaineWebber. ''The probability of a significant and swift competitive response is 100 percent.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, American Airlines and Delta Air Lines, United's biggest rivals, chose not to comment on the proposed combination.</p>
        <p>But analysts said the competitive reaction from within the industry might be swift and could come in several forms.</p>
        <p>They said the most obvious counterattack would be if American topped United's offer for US Airways.</p>
        <p>''If you want US Airways, you better step in quickly,'' said Glenn Engel, an airline analyst at Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company. ''And I don't know why AMR's attitude about US Airways would have changed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Higgins said that American, which considered a run at US Airways in 1995, would be ''permanently marginalized'' if United were able to complete the transaction.</p>
        <p>Analysts said that United did not appear to fear a higher bid. Part of that has to do with the $60-a-share price, a figure most consider to be generous, if not rich. In addition, United attached a fairly low breakup fee of $160 million, which is not likely to scare off a would-be suitor.</p>
        <p>Julius Maldutis, global aviation analyst at CIBC World Markets, said that in the wake of the transaction, ''AMR, Continental Airlines and Northwest will have to make some strategic moves.''</p>
        <p>The risk to United-US Airways, he said, is if all the carriers decide to make moves in short order.</p>
        <p>''The only thing that can queer the United deal is if there are a number of mergers that are proposed that leave us with three major carriers,'' Mr. Maldutis said. ''If that were to happen, then the Justice Department and the Department of Transportation would have a major migraine.''</p>
        <p>Antitrust experts said yesterday that they expected the proposed acquisition to be under review for many months by both the Justice Department and the Transportation Department, a process that could last into the next administration.</p>
        <p>The review would involve an examination of every market where the two companies have a presence. Because it is not known who would be leading the antitrust division at the Justice Department, it is impossible to predict the results of that review.</p>
        <p>But experts and securities analysts expect that at the very least the two companies may have to shed assets beyond just their holdings in the Washington area.</p>
        <p>Moreover, regulators most likely will consider what might happen next.</p>
        <p>''If this succeeds, which is by no means certain, it could trigger further industry consolidation,'' said Philip Baggaley, a managing director at the Standard &amp; Poor's Corporation. ''The regulators will have to be thinking about follow-on combinations, as well as the UAL-US Airways merger.''</p>
        <p>As an opening move, UAL and US Airways have agreed to sell significant parts of routes that operate in and out of Ronald Reagan National Airport in Washington. But Washington has more than one airport. United and US Airways, which rank No. 1 and No. 2, respectively, in terms of market share at Dulles International Airport, may have to give up more.</p>
        <p>''The Washington, D.C., area is glaringly anticompetitive,'' said Mr. Higgins of Donaldson, Lufkin. ''I firmly believe the fix they are proposing is highly inadequate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodwin said that Robert L. Johnson, a US Airways board member and the founder of Black Entertainment Television, had agreed to pay more than $100 million for the assets at Reagan Airport.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson, who has no experience operating an airline, will have a fleet of 37 planes operating out of the airport. Ten of those, 737-200's, will be leased from United.</p>
        <p>Chicago is another city where United may be forced to give ground, Mr. Baggaley said.</p>
        <p>''The biggest competitive impact outside the direct overlap would be in Chicago,'' the Standard &amp; Poor's analyst said, ''where both United and American have hubs.''</p>
        <p>While regulators scrutinize the deal, Congress will also be watching closely.</p>
        <p>In a joint statement, Senator Mike DeWine, an Ohio Republican, and Senator Herb Kohl, a Wisconsin Democrat, said: ''The proposed merger between United Airlines and US Airways will require very careful scrutiny. If this action precipitates a wave of consolidation in an already consolidated industry, it is hard to see how that result will be good for consumers.''</p>
        <p>Senator DeWine is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee's subcommittee on antitrust, business rights and competition. Senator Kohl is the panel's ranking member.</p>
        <p>Then there is labor.</p>
        <p>Objections from United's pilots in 1995 were a big factor behind the airline's decision to back off a combination with US Airways.</p>
        <p>As part of the most recent deal, United has agreed to retain virtually all 45,000 US Airways employees. Job security will probably be popular with that carrier's unions. But seniority questions will probably be important issues for United's unions, particularly the pilots.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goodwin said he was optimistic the company's unions would support the deal. But yesterday the pilots, whose representative on United's board voted to reject the takeover, were far from enthusiastic.</p>
        <p>Rick Dubinsky, chairman of the master executive council of the pilots union, issued a statement expressing ''deep disappointment'' that the company had agreed to buy US Airways without reaching ''full agreement'' with the pilots on ''all issues.''</p>
        <p>Complicating matters further, contract negotiations with the pilots and United's machinists will be conducted over the summer.</p>
        <p>''Labor integration issues are a real risk,'' said Mr. Higgins of Donaldson, Lufkin. ''I am not sure that union leadership is the question, but the rank and file. The risk is you can't make everybody happy. And this is an industry where it doesn't take much operational disruption to screw up earnings.''</p>
        <p>Objections from its pilots was only one reason United backed away from a 1995 deal for US Airways. The company was also worried about the effect a purchase would have on its balance sheet and credit rating.</p>
        <p>The carrier has long coveted an investment-grade rating for its bonds. And over the last four years it has slogged toward that goal.</p>
        <p>But its bonds are now rated BB+ by Standard &amp; Poor's, one notch below investment-grade status.</p>
        <p>That is almost certain to change if the US Airways deal goes through. As part of the deal, United will assume $1.5 billion in US Airways debt and $5.8 billion in lease obligations. And it will also borrow $3 billion of the $4.3 billion in cash it has agreed to pay to US Airways shareholders.</p>
        <p>''Effectively, all of the $11.6 billion of the acquisition price would represent increased financial obligations of one sort or another,'' Mr. Baggaley said. ''We have calculated that would raise UAL's debt-to-capital ratio from 71 percent to 81 percent and weaken other credit measures.''</p>
        <p>Standard &amp; Poor's said yesterday that it had placed UAL on credit watch with negative implications, and US Airways on credit watch with positive implications. Moody's Investors Service took similar action.</p>
        <p>The combined debt of the two airlines, including off-balance sheet leases, is $28 billion, Mr. Baggaley said, a number that exceeds 1999's combined revenue of $26.6 billion.</p>
        <p>Riding with that much debt could be a real risk in the event the economy sours next year or in 2002.</p>
        <p>''A downturn would make them more vulnerable, no question,'' said Michael Mulvaney, a managing director who follows the airline industry for Moody's.</p>
