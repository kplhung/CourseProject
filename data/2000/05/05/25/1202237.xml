        <p>Editorial hails House vote to permanently normalize trade ties with China; sees bill as first step toward broadening ties with Chinese and pressing them to open nation to democracy, rule of law and respect for human rights</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>By approving legislation that permanently normalizes trade relations with China, the House opened the way yesterday for a more stable and productive relationship with that country. President Clinton and the Republican leadership also won an important victory for the principle of bipartisan leadership in foreign policy. The Senate is expected to endorse the China trade bill soon. Congressional approval, however, must be seen as a first step toward broadening relations with the Chinese and pressing them to open their country to democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights.</p>
        <p>In the end, the vote was more one-sided than many had predicted. The House speaker, Dennis Hastert, and his deputies Dick Armey and Tom DeLay were more successful than the president in bringing along their party faithful, many of whom were persuaded by the business interests lobbying furiously until the very end. Gov. George W. Bush and a raft of respected Republican former presidents, cabinet members and officeholders helped. On the Democratic side, Mr. Clinton got only 73 votes against a tough campaign waged by unions and by the House Democratic leadership.</p>

        <p>By approving legislation that permanently normalizes trade relations with China, the House opened the way yesterday for a more stable and productive relationship with that country. President Clinton and the Republican leadership also won an important victory for the principle of bipartisan leadership in foreign policy. The Senate is expected to endorse the China trade bill soon. Congressional approval, however, must be seen as a first step toward broadening relations with the Chinese and pressing them to open their country to democracy, the rule of law and respect for human rights.</p>
        <p>In the end, the vote was more one-sided than many had predicted. The House speaker, Dennis Hastert, and his deputies Dick Armey and Tom DeLay were more successful than the president in bringing along their party faithful, many of whom were persuaded by the business interests lobbying furiously until the very end. Gov. George W. Bush and a raft of respected Republican former presidents, cabinet members and officeholders helped. On the Democratic side, Mr. Clinton got only 73 votes against a tough campaign waged by unions and by the House Democratic leadership.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers who favored the bill essentially bet that by competing in the global economy, the United States can advance the cause of liberty around the world and help shape international commercial forces to everyone's advantage, including American workers and Chinese democrats. They correctly judged that increased trade with China would not only expand the sale of more American goods there but also widen the circulation of democratic values.</p>
        <p>Passage of the trade bill will not diminish the need for vigilance over China's human rights problems. Mr. Clinton struck the right note after the vote when he pledged to use China's accession to the World Trade Organization as a way of monitoring environmental and labor standards in China, as well as the rule of law and freedom of expression and religion. He gave appropriate credit as well to Representatives Sander Levin of Michigan and Douglas Bereuter of Nebraska, who crafted legislation for a commission to monitor Chinese human rights as a way of bringing skeptics on board.</p>
        <p>It will take vigorous action to continue the pressure on China on these issues. There is understandable skepticism about the position that simply trading with China and opening it up to foreign investment will produce a more open society. But a striking number of experts on China, and many in the dissident community in China, have argued persuasively that creating wealth in the private economy, along with more avenues of communication, will strengthen those Chinese in a position to demand a pluralistic and democratic society.</p>
        <p>The world will now be looking to China to honor its trade obligations, including the lowering of barriers to foreign investment and goods. But in the years ahead as China takes its place among the world's economic and political powers, it must also treat its own people with dignity and respect. The measure of yesterday's House action, and Mr. Clinton's handling of China, should not just be the future state of the Chinese economy but the state of Chinese society.</p>
