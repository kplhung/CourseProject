        <p>IN a world where nearly everything seems to be getting miniaturized, the new I.B.M. Thinkpad T20 portable computer is traveling in the other direction. If it were any larger, I.B.M. could have equipped this impressively redesigned laptop with folding legs and offered it as a card table.</p>
        <p>It would be an expensive card table, to be sure, given that the fastest model starts at about $4,000, not counting the broad array of options that I.B.M. is offering for it. But hey, thanks to the games built into the Windows operating system, this would be a card table that came with its own game of solitaire.</p>

        <p>IN a world where nearly everything seems to be getting miniaturized, the new I.B.M. Thinkpad T20 portable computer is traveling in the other direction. If it were any larger, I.B.M. could have equipped this impressively redesigned laptop with folding legs and offered it as a card table.</p>
        <p>It would be an expensive card table, to be sure, given that the fastest model starts at about $4,000, not counting the broad array of options that I.B.M. is offering for it. But hey, thanks to the games built into the Windows operating system, this would be a card table that came with its own game of solitaire.</p>
        <p>But in a neat bit of sleight-of-hand, I.B.M. trumps the generous proportions -- 12 inches by 10 inches, to accommodate a 14-inch display screen -- by making the T20 surprisingly thin and light, at about five pounds, including its DVD-ROM drive. And it is not even the biggest or the most expensive of the new ThinkPads. That honor goes to the ThinkPad A20p ($3,900), a high-performance portable for the expense-account crowd, with a 15-inch screen that adds an inch to the computer in both width and depth.</p>
        <p>Another model, the A20m, is aimed at a more budget-conscious audience, with prices starting at $1,800.</p>
        <p>The T20 and A20p models have powerful Intel mobile Pentium III microprocessors operating at 650 or 700 megahertz, making them among the most powerful laptops on the planet. (The A20m comes in models with either an Intel Celeron or Pentium III chip.)</p>
        <p>The new ThinkPads really ought to have been called ReThinkPads because it is clear that in revamping and streamlining its entire line of laptops, International Business Machines spent considerable time rethinking the idea of the portable computing device.</p>
        <p>On one level the new models are the next evolutionary step in a venerable, popular and award-winning line of notebook and laptop computers. On another level, however, I.B.M. has recognized better than most PC makers that a laptop is not just a desktop computer that has been squeezed to fit into a briefcase and rigged to run on batteries. Instead, it is a mobile information device with peculiar requirements and capabilities.</p>
        <p>For example, the T20 that I tested has a new array of color-coded buttons just above the keyboard that trigger specific mobile applications, including a ThinkPad button that automatically connects the user to an Internet-based service center, assuming the laptop is connected to a network, of course. The idea is to harness the power of the Internet to improve the overall experience of working with the computer.</p>
        <p>The online services include animated demonstrations and a lot of the reference materials that I.B.M. left out of the rather disappointing user's manual. There are also tips for maximizing battery life, for adding and removing software features and even for how to create a better PowerPoint presentation -- as if the world needed more PowerPoint presentations.</p>
        <p>I.B.M. has also created an online area where ThinkPad users can share tips and experiences. The ThinkPad site has links to all sorts of practical travel information, which is an unexpected but logical step, considering that the ThinkPads are often used while traveling.</p>
        <p>It is unclear how the average ThinkPad user will benefit from tales of exotic computing adventures in Tibet or the polar regions, or the knowledge that there are two million saunas in Finland, but it shows that I.B.M. is literally thinking outside the box -- thinking about the customer, that is.</p>
        <p>Another example of this is in the keyboard design. The ThinkPad keyboards were already the best of any laptops, but I.B.M. has added a ThinkLight, which uses a subtle light-emitting diode to illuminate the keyboard when the user is working in dark rooms or airplanes. The glow from the screen itself illuminated the keyboard almost as well as the ThinkLight, but the lighted keyboard is indicative of I.B.M.'s attention to detail. It's the thought that counts.</p>
        <p>Volume controls for the CD or DVD drive are also conveniently placed on the keyboard, a feature not unique to ThinkPads but executed well. Travelers like to use their laptops to listen to audio CD's or to watch DVD movies. Besides controls to turn the volume up and down, there is also a mute button.</p>
        <p>The ''T'' in T20 officially stands for ''thin' -- the model is less than an inch and a half thick -- but it could also stand for titanium, the strong, lightweight metal that is used along with carbon-fiber-reinforced plastic in the body of both the T20 and A20.</p>
        <p>The titanium composite shell armors the ThinkPads against two of the laptop's natural enemies: clumsy handling and the unexpected attack when the person in the airplane seat in front of you suddenly reclines. Many laptop screens have been crushed to death on airplanes, but the new ThinkPads are designed to be more tolerant of rough handling than most.</p>
        <p>Even so, the fact remains that the size of the new ThinkPads makes them unsuited for use in the coach class of airplanes -- even in the Exit row, which is where I tested the T20.</p>
        <p>While portability is the main reason someone would spend so much for a computer, the new T20 and A20 ThinkPads are also worthy of consideration as replacements for desktop computers, especially with an optional docking station ($499) or port replicator ($149).</p>
        <p>With these ThinkPads, I.B.M. has introduced an Ultrabay 2000 expansion bay that allows the user to add an extra battery or a variety of optional drives, including a DVD-ROM or CD-ROM drive or an Imation SuperDisk 120-MB removable drive that doubles as a floppy drive. The Ultrabay devices can be used with both the T and A series laptops and with I.B.M.'s new line of NetVista desktop computers.</p>
        <p>An UltraPort connector above the  center of the ThinkPad screen allows the integration of an optional U.S.B. digital camera (about $100), which can be used for capturing quick still images or as a simple video camera for videoconferencing. I.B.M. says the UltraPort will also be used for short-distance, wireless radio networking technology called Bluetooth when a Bluetooth module becomes available later this year. Bluetooth is expected to become a standard for wireless connections to printers, handheld computers and other devices, replacing cables.</p>
        <p>A Communications Bay on the bottom of the ThinkPads can be used for a variety of connectivity options, supplementing the built-in Ethernet and phone connectors.</p>
        <p>In terms of other specs, the T20 I tested came with 128 MB of memory, 8 MB of video memory and an 11.2-gigabyte hard disk. The lithium-ion battery ran about three and a half hours between rechargings, which is impressive given the level of work it does. It is more than sufficient for watching a DVD movie on the big (for laptops, at least) screen.</p>
        <p>The screen has a maximum resolution of 1024 by 768, which translates, depending on how you calculate pixels, to hundreds of thousands of screen elements. So if just two of the pixels were bad -- as they were on the machine I tested -- it would presumably be hard to complain. But the two bad pixels manifested themselves annoyingly as perpetually white dots in the center of the screen. Laptop makers have varying standards on what constitutes a bad screen, but generally two bad pixels are not enough to fail the screen or warrant a replacement.</p>
        <p>The chip in the flagship 700-MHz-model T20, which is expected to be available in about a month, will be modestly faster than the 650-MHz Pentiums, which until now were the fastest portable-computer chips in the Windows world.</p>
        <p>Intel has made a big deal out of the SpeedStep technology in its new Pentium portable chips, which operate at maximum speed when connected to an external power source but ratchet down to a slower, more energy-efficient speed when running on battery power. The Apple Powerbook has had the same technology for years.</p>
