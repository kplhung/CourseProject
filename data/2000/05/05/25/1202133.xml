        <p>The honored organizations will get more than tributes, since the corporate sponsors of this concert series, called Beethoven 2000, have provided $5,000 to each, and the money donated by individuals will also be distributed.</p>
        <p>The Orion players (the violinist Daniel and Todd Phillips, the violist Steven Tenenbom, and the cellist Timothy Eddy) have performed the Beethoven quartets during the 13 years they have been together, but never in a complete cycle. At the first and final concerts, which I attended, the pressure of preparing all 16 works for performances over an 11-day period was palpable. Although the playing was often strong, an unsettled quality was never quite shaken off, and pitch problems, especially from the Phillips brothers, who traded first and second violin parts throughout the cycle, were sometimes distracting.</p>
        <p>The series began auspiciously on the opening night with an engaging performance of the Quartet in D major, Op. 18, No. 3, third in order but the first Beethoven composed. The playing was lithe and buoyant and the musicians were full of ideas. At the final concert, on Tuesday, another early work, the Quartet in B flat, Op. 18, No. 6, received a lively reading. In a way, the players saved the best for last. They ended the cycle, and the series, with the astonishing late Quartet in C sharp minor, Op. 131. And though the playing was sometimes rough, particularly in the frenetic Presto movement, their sense of involvement with this amazing work, at once strangely cosmic and rigorously intellectual, was hard to resist.</p>
        <p>That's clearly the way this young audience felt. That many classical music neophytes were there was obvious: people blithely brought snacks into the hall and applauded after every movement of every work. A young man in the row behind me asked an older gentleman sitting next to him to please explain what a viola was.</p>
        <p>But when the music started, people listened with a rapt attention that pervaded the hall. And when the performance of the final quartet ended, the Orion players were greeted with a standing, whooping ovation. This was not an occasion for a critic to quibble over intonation and phrasing. The Chamber Music Society intended this series as a gift to New York, and it was received as a generous and exciting one.</p>
