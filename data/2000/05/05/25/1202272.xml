        <p>After weathering the costliest barrage of attack ads in the history of a United States Senate primary, Jim Florio returned fire today by releasing his first three television ads -- all of them harshly critical of his Democratic opponent, Jon S. Corzine.</p>
        <p>But the real story behind the Florio campaign's media strategy has been its unusual reliance on so-called ''free media'' -- newspaper and broadcast news coverage -- to counteract Mr. Corzine's huge advantage in campaign money.</p>
        <p>Even with the three ads Mr. Florio released today, and a fourth ad by his Democratic supporters in Camden County, Mr. Florio's spending on television is unlikely to reach $2 million in the remaining days before the June 6 primary. Mr. Corzine has spent more than $12 million on TV  advertising, and yesterday he announced that he would increase his ad spending to $2 million each week -- more than any candidate has ever spent in a New Jersey election.</p>
        <p>Despite that daunting financial disadvantage, Mr. Florio believes he can overcome Mr. Corzine's spending. His campaign is based on the belief that in New Jersey, a state with no network television market of its own, newspapers dictate the media agenda.</p>
        <p>Such thinking is considered heresy by most political strategists. Newspapers have had declining readerships for years, and it is an article of faith among most campaign managers that the candidate who controls the airwaves wins the race. Others contend that Mr. Florio, who is unable to match Mr. Corzine's half-billion-dollar fortune, is trying to put a positive spin on his dismal competitive disadvantage.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Mr. Florio is not alone in contending that New Jersey is essentially a newspaper state.</p>
        <p>John O'Brien, executive director of the New Jersey Press Association, said that 98 percent of the television and radio broadcasts viewed or heard in New Jersey originate from out of state, mostly from Philadelphia and New York. A recent study of consumer habits found that the average New Jerseyan reads two daily newspapers and one weekly on a regular basis, Mr. O'Brien said.</p>
        <p>''There's been no national study, but I've talked to press associations in other states, and no one even came close,'' Mr. O'Brien said.</p>
        <p>Even the demographic trend that most alarms publishers -- the rise in the average age of newspaper readers -- can be viewed as a competitive advantage, Mr. Florio said.</p>
        <p>''Some people predict that 30 percent, even 40 percent of the people who vote in this primary will be senior citizens, so that really helps as far as I'm concerned.''</p>
        <p>While acknowledging that he envies Mr. Corzine's ability to deploy ads at will, Mr. Florio said he and his media advisers have tried to capitalize on the state's unusual media dynamic in several ways.</p>
        <p>Each time Mr. Corzine has released a new ad, the Florio campaign has held news conferences attacking Mr. Corzine on everything from his sporadic voting record in previous Democratic primaries to Goldman Sachs's interest in a company that benefits the regime in Sudan.</p>
        <p>None of those charges have turned into the kind of long-running news story that Mr. Florio's handlers might have hoped for. But the effect was to blunt some critical Corzine ads on the days they were first broadcast. As a whole, the Florio campaign's attacks in the newspapers have also laid the groundwork for the broadsides Mr. Florio has fired in his TV ads.</p>
        <p>The ads that began today disparage Mr. Corzine's positions on Social Security and health care and his refusal to release his tax returns.</p>
        <p>But many analysts disagree with Mr. Florio's suggestion that news coverage can compensate for Mr. Corzine's advantage in television, direct mail and other paid advertising.</p>
        <p>Although TV advertising is an expensive and inefficient way to reach New Jersey voters -- because 80 percent of the viewers of Philadelphia and New York TV stations cannot vote in New Jersey -- many analysts say it is still the most effective way to promote a candidate.</p>
        <p>''The fact is, New Jersey isn't a newspaper state,'' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. ''The problem is, readership is down. You can't play the print strategy because you don't reach the numbers of people you need to reach to counteract TV.''</p>
        <p>Whether or not Mr. Florio's theory is correct, his attempt to translate it into a cogent strategy has been complicated by his own missteps.</p>
        <p>After ridiculing Mr. Corzine's proposal to invest some Social Security money in the stock market, Mr. Florio was embarrassed last week when The New Jersey Jewish News released an audiotape of Mr. Florio eloquently advocating the same idea in May 1999.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's campaign says that gaffe, and Mr. Florio's decision to run a TV ad that criticizes Mr. Corzine's proposal on Social Security, belie the claim that Mr. Florio values news coverage more than paid TV advertising.</p>
        <p>Steven Goldstein, Mr. Corzine's co-campaign manager, said: ''It's as if  Florio said to himself: 'Look, I know the papers are going to kill me for airing ads contradicting what the papers themselves uncovered, but who cares? I'll take that chance because TV is all that counts.' ''</p>
