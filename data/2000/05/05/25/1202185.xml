        <p>No baby sitter? No problem.</p>
        <p>Nationwide, a growing number of movie theaters, supermarkets, gyms and casinos are adding playrooms where parents can leave their children for a few hours while they spend money, watch a film or work out.</p>
        <p>''Parents tell us they love it,'' said Dave DeMascole, manager of the Wegmans supermarket here, which opened last August with a large W-Kids Play Center. ''We're getting about 500 kids a week, and there have been times when we've had to turn people away because it's too full. It's free, and it gives them an hour or two to shop in an enjoyable way. I have two young children myself, and I understand, no matter how much you love them, how nice it can be to get away from those interruptions.''</p>
        <p>Over the last three years, Wegmans Food Markets has opened play centers at 29 of its 51 stores in New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and plans to open more as it expands. Wegmans is not the only one: even in the absence of proof that in-store child care increases profits, a 1998 survey by the Food Marketing Institute found that almost one in five new supermarkets nationwide would include such care.</p>
        <p>It has been 15 years since Ikea created a stir with its store featuring a ''ballroom'' where could children could romp in a sea of plastic balls while their parents shopped for home furnishings. But it is only in the last few years that on-site child care has caught on more widely.</p>
        <p>Just what this trend means is open to debate. Many see it as auspicious evidence of a more family-friendly world. Others say it is simply -- and crassly -- a matter of businesses working harder to turn parents into customers. Some child-care experts worry that, however convenient for parents, the playrooms are symptomatic of a society in which children dwell in a separate sphere devoted to their entertainment, rather than being included in adult life.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to know what to make of it,'' said Ellen Galinsky, president of the Families and Work Institute, a nonprofit research group in Manhattan. ''On one hand, it's certainly a positive thing that some businesses or stores that might not have welcomed children at all a few years ago are now making a place for them. It's also true that businesses are looking at parent-consumers in a more sophisticated way. But I can imagine some people seeing it as sad, as encouragement for parents to be apart from their kids more, to leave them outside the daily routines.''</p>
        <p>Two decades ago, riding the tide of baby boomer child-centeredness, a flurry of ''mommy-and-me'' programs emerged in which mothers and children exercised together, swam together and did art projects together. But now, the programs tend to separate ''mommy'' from ''me.''</p>
        <p>Many mothers say the baby-sitting programs are a godsend in an era when parents are harried and teenage baby sitters are scarce and expensive.</p>
        <p>''I don't have anyone to watch my 3-year-old daughter, so until this began about a year ago, the only movies I went to were kiddie things,'' said Ingrid Roberts of Pembroke Pines, Fla., who uses the child-care center at Muvico's Paradise 24 movie theater whenever she can. ''For the last three Friday nights in a row, my girlfriend's come from the beach with her daughter, and we put the two girls in the playroom, and we see movies while they play together there. It means a lot to me. I know she's safe, I know she's having a ball, and I get a night out, which I really need.''</p>
        <p>Muvico Theaters in Florida began offering care centers for children 3 to 8 at its multiplexes in Tampa, Davie and Pompano Beach.</p>
        <p>''We had talked to moviegoers about why they didn't go more often, and baby-sitting was one of the main reasons,'' said Randi Emerman, a Muvico spokeswoman. ''Movies are usually spontaneous, something you decide to do that day, but usually baby sitters have to be lined up a week in advance. So we saw this as an amenity that would get parents going to the movies more.''</p>
        <p>Muvico gives parent and child matching wristbands like those used in hospitals, and releases the child only to an adult wearing the wristband. The theater also gives parents a vibrating beeper so they can be reached in an emergency without disturbing other moviegoers.</p>
        <p>Wegmans has a similar system. ''We page for potty runs,'' said Jo Natale, a corporate spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>Occasionally, the security can be cumbersome.</p>
        <p>''There was one mom, in the midst of shopping, who remembered she had to go get another child off the bus,'' Ms. Natale said. ''She went home, then remembered she'd left the younger child with us, so she snipped off her wristband and gave it to a neighbor to come do the pickup. But of course we wouldn't release the child to the neighbor.''</p>
        <p>Some parents use the Wegmans in Princeton as semiregular child care, arranging to meet friends for coffee or lunch at the store's spacious cafe, while their children have an instant play group, playing on the padded climbing structure, doing puzzles, or watching a videotape of ''Madeline.''</p>
        <p>''We have one mom who drops her twin 4-year-old boys every Monday, Wednesday and Friday, and goes to the cafe for the full two-hour limit,'' said Ruth Sommer, the W-Kids supervisor. ''That's fine with us. She's still spending money in the store.''</p>
        <p>It is not fine with Wegmans, though, when parents deposit their children and go off to shop elsewhere.</p>
        <p>''There have been a couple isolated incidents when we've paged someone and they weren't in the store, and we've had to explain that that's not what this is for,'' said Mr. DeMascole, the Wegmans manager.</p>
        <p>There are still a few parents -- but only a few -- strolling the aisles with little children in their shopping carts, some because the child does not like being left with strangers and others because shopping together is a pleasure.</p>
        <p>''This is something we like to do together, so we can talk about what we're going to have for dinner and she can pick out what she likes,'' said Lisa Gill, whose daughter, Chelsea, was happily holding a pudding pack she had selected herself. ''I do leave her at the child care at my gym, but shopping for food is something we can share.''</p>
        <p>Though the child care at Wegmans is free, many of the programs charge a fee -- about the price of a movie ticket at Muvico theaters, and $5 to $6 an hour at many gyms and casinos. Either way, most of the companies have only a hazy sense that the programs are making a bottom-line difference.</p>
        <p>''We don't really know how it's affecting our profits,'' said Ms. Emerman of Muvico. ''We think it's doing well, but we look at it as an amenity to get people going to the movies.''</p>
        <p>Generally, for-profit hourly child care has been tough going: several baby-sitting ventures at shopping malls have folded after a year or two. And New Horizon Kids Quest, a publicly traded company that runs the hourly child care at Minnesota's Mall of America and 19 casinos in six states, has had its struggles.</p>
        <p>''It's not an easy business,'' said Susan K. Dunkley, the president of New Horizon. ''It's so unpredictable and you need to staff people even if there are no children there. We're doing very well in casinos in Las Vegas, Michigan and Connecticut, but the hosts, whether it's casinos or shopping centers, need to understand that it's an amenity they're going to have to subsidize in some way, shape or form.''</p>
        <p>Although the overall financial impact of child-care programs is unclear, many parents who use the programs say the availability of child care is what made them customers.</p>
        <p>''This is the only reason I joined this gym,'' said Lisette Reisman, as she picked up her daughter, Simone, this week at the Crunch gym on the Upper West Side in Manhattan, where child care for children 6 months to 4 years is free to members. ''I looked at other places with child care, like Reebok and New York Sports Club, but they all charged extra, and here it's free to members. And Simone loves it. I always have to drag her out.''</p>
