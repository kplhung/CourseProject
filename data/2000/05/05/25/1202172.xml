        <p>Open positions of short sales on the Nasdaq stock market rose 4.8 percent in the most recent monthly period, the National Association of Securities Dealers, which operates the market, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Investors who sell shares short borrow them from a brokerage firm and then sell them, hoping to buy the shares back at lower prices and make a profit. But if the shares rise in price, the short-seller faces a loss.</p>
        <p>Uncovered short sales, or those with open positions, are those shares that have been borrowed and sold, but not yet covered by repurchase.</p>
        <p>Uncovered short sales in all 4,725 Nasdaq securities totaled 2.78 billion shares in the month ended May 15, compared with 4,729 securities and 2.65 billion shares in the previous month.</p>
        <p>High short-interest positions have long been considered an indicator of bearish sentiment among market investors. But short interest can also result from complex trading strategies involving options, futures and other stock-related derivatives.</p>
