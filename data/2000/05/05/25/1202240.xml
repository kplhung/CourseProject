        <p>Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer withdrew his opposition yesterday to plans by the big nonprofit health insurer, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, to change into a for-profit company. As part of the shift, Empire would set up a multimillion-dollar foundation dedicated to making health care broadly accessible.</p>
        <p>Empire had offered to give the State Legislature the right to approve or disapprove the conversion and a voice in deciding its future, and to give the public a role in governing the company and the foundation. But hospital and union officials said they would seek to defeat the conversion plan in the Legislature.</p>
        <p>The State Insurance Department approved Empire's proposal last year, but Mr. Spitzer delayed it, arguing that the public needed more of a voice in the new entities. He said that after lengthy negotiations, Empire had agreed to let the new foundation select 6 of the new for-profit company's 15-member board.</p>
        <p>Consumer advocates said the new foundation would be valued at more than $500 million, based on Empire's current reserves. The foundation would not directly provide insurance,  but it would try to influence the insurance market by creating models for expanded coverage.</p>
        <p>Most of the 49 Blue Cross associations in the United States are still nonprofit companies. But Blue Cross plans in at least nine states, including Connecticut, have converted to for-profit status. Those plans created foundations to repay part of the tax breaks and subsidies they had received over the years.</p>
        <p>Consumer groups and state officials pressed for the foundations and brought lawsuits in some states. A spokeswoman for Empire said the company structured its proposal to avert such suits.</p>
        <p>Dr. Michael Stocker, president of Empire, has said that it wants to convert because it needs the ability private companies have to sell stock,  to raise money for expensive computerized information systems so it can compete with for-profit health insurers like Aetna Inc. and Oxford Health Plans.</p>
        <p>Kenneth Raske, president of the Greater New York Hospital Association, and Dennis Rivera, president of 1199, the hospital workers' union,  said in separate statements that they would oppose the plan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Raske said that creating ''another investor-owned payer will work against the interests of doctors, hospitals and consumers.'' He said the company's executives ''would be more concerned with the price of their stock than their ability to deliver services.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rivera said the charitable foundation would not be sufficient compensation for allowing the company to abandon its role as the traditional insurer of people who could not get coverage elsewhere. ''This foundation is a smoke screen and a sweetener to make this happen,'' he said. ''Clearly, the large numbers of uninsured cannot be helped by the paltry sums they are talking about.''</p>
        <p>Empire has promised that there would be no change in the coverage it now provides for 4.1 million customers or in its rates, if the conversion happens. And the company no longer has a special duty to cover people with difficult problems, under changes in laws and subsidies over the last few years. Now all health maintenance organizations are required to accept all applicants at the same rates.</p>
        <p>One in four New York City residents under 65 does not have health insurance. Statewide, almost one in five is uninsured, according to consumer advocates. A new health care  law provides $30 million to subsidize insurance for people with expensive, long-term medical problems.</p>
        <p>The chairmen of the Senate and Assembly insurance committees indicated they would support Empire's plans. ''It has been done in other states, and I think it makes sense for Empire,'' said Senator James L. Seward, chairman of the insurance committee. Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis also offered strong support.</p>
        <p>The national Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association also could veto the deal, but health care analysts said the national group was unlikely to risk losing Empire as a member.</p>
        <p>The six members of the new company's board selected by the foundation would include representatives of consumers and health care industries, and people with philanthropic experience, said James Tallon, president of the United Hospital Fund.</p>
        <p>The hospital fund wants to operate the new foundation for five years and hopes to receive a permanent operating franchise.</p>
        <p>Mark Scherzer, legislative counsel of New Yorkers for Accessible Coverage, a consumer group, said the main concerns were providing the public with a say in running the foundation and insuring that foundation funds were used appropriately.</p>
        <p>Empire reported last week that its net income doubled to $53 million on revenue of $1 billion in the quarter ended March 31 from $25.5 million in the first quarter of 1999. Operating income rose $15 million in the quarter, and investment income accounted for the rest.</p>
        <p>Empire said that 2.87 million, or 71 percent, of its members insured through corporate employers were in managed care plans, which insurance companies regard as their main profit centers.</p>
