        <p>If simply watching the Indianapolis 500 on television this Memorial Day isn't enough, the Net is offering a virtual seat behind the wheel.</p>
        <p>Excite@Home has enabled a Web site (sports.excite.com) to show the dashboard of Eddie Cheever's super-sleek car as he races around the track at more than 220 miles per hour.</p>
        <p>The race car, which beams telemetry to Mr. Cheever's trackside crew, will be seen on home computers as a 3-D model. A mouse click on parts of the car will display information like tire pressure and oil temperature.</p>
        <p>Before the race, online viewers can also get a driver's-eye view of a lap around the speedway on www.indy500.com/multimedia.</p>
