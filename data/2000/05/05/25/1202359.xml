        <p>The timing was perfect yesterday for a third meeting of Glen Sather; Dave Checketts, Madison Square Garden's president; and James Dolan of Cablevision, Checketts's boss.</p>
        <p>The Knicks, the Garden's other prime property, had a day off in Indiana. And most of Sather's former Edmonton scouting staff was not scheduled to arrive at Sather's La Quinta, Calif., property for annual meetings until last night.</p>
        <p>''It's imminent,'' a National Hockey League official said yesterday. ''If not today or tomorrow, then the next day.''</p>
        <p>Sather, Checketts and Dolan will be trying to forge an agreement that will bring Sather to New York as team president, and probably general manager , of the Rangers. Checketts, another N.H.L. official said yesterday, has expressed his preference at splitting the duties.</p>
        <p>''But if Sather is going to come to New York,'' the first N.H.L. official said, ''he's going to have to have total authority to do whatever he wants, whenever he wants.''</p>
        <p>''I really believe Glen's going to end up in New York,'' the official said.</p>
