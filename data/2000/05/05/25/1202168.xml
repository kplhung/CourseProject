        <p>The European Union decided today to extend its ban on beef produced with growth hormones, rejecting demands by the United States and the World Trade Organization to drop the prohibition.</p>
        <p>The decision reignites an ideologically charged battle between American cattle ranchers, most of whom use hormones to accelerate beef production, and European consumers, who generally distrust food additives.</p>
        <p>Nearly three years ago, the World Trade Organization ruled that that European prohibition was illegal because it was not based on scientific evidence that hormones endanger human health.</p>
        <p>Today, European officials in Brussels released what they described as a new review of scientific studies that concluded that one popular hormone causes cancer and that others are ''likely'' to pose increased health risks.</p>
        <p>Armed with the new opinion, European trade and health officials said they would extend the ban on hormone-treated beef.</p>
        <p>''We believe this proposal will bring us into line with the W.T.O.'s findings, and definitively resolve this dispute,'' said Anthony Gooch, a spokesman for the European Commission's trade ministry.</p>
        <p>American officials, who were still scrutinizing the new pronouncements today, said they were not impressed.</p>
        <p>''We were of the view from the beginning that they didn't have the science to back them up, and we don't see any new science now,'' one official in Brussels said today.</p>
        <p>The United States is currently imposing punitive tariffs of $117 million a year, an amount that the World Trade Organization says is equal to the lost American beef exports, on European products ranging from Danish ham to Italian tomatoes.</p>
        <p>In an effort to intensify the pressure, President Clinton recently signed legislation that requires American trade officials to rotate the penalties to different industries every six months.</p>
        <p>But there is little likelihood that the two sides will reach an accord anytime soon, in part because many Europeans have a deep mistrust of anything that smacks of genetically modified food.</p>
        <p>Just last week, farmers from Scandinavia to Britain and Italy found themselves in the middle of a political uproar after a company admitted that it had accidentally mixed a small percentage of genetically modified rapeseed from Canada into seed shipments sold across Europe.</p>
        <p>Genetically modified crops are  common in the United States and Canada and only about 0.4 percent of the seeds mixed into the shipments that arrived in Europe appeared to have been genetically modified. Nevertheless, the slip infuriated officials in several countries and Swedish farm regulators went so far as to order farmers to destroy the questionable seeds.</p>
        <p>The battle over beef hormones could easily become an important test case in future trade disputes based on real or perceived health risks.</p>
        <p>Under international trade agreements, countries are only allowed to impose trade restrictions based on health concerns if those concerns are backed by scientific evidence.</p>
        <p>American trade officials, echoing the views of American cattle farmers, have argued that there is no evidence that beef produced with hormones poses special health problems.</p>
        <p>Among other things, they argue that growth hormones are naturally present in beef and other foods and that two pounds of hormone-treated beef have about the same amount of growth hormone as that in an ordinary egg.</p>
        <p>European officials, prodded by persistent anxiety among consumers, have argued that there are many reasons to be worried. After protracted hearings at the World Trade Organization, the organization ruled that European officials had not made their case and deemed the ban illegal in 1997.</p>
        <p>Today's report, from a scientific committee organized by the European Union, said there was evidence that high doses of the hormone 17 beta oestriadol had carcinogenic effects and that five other hormones might affect the development of sexual organs.</p>
        <p>Under the legislation proposed today, the European Union would impose a permanent ban on beta oestriadol and ''provisional'' bans on the other five, pending the outcome of future studies.</p>
        <p>The scientific committee acknowledged that the evidence of health risks was based on exposure to very high doses of hormones. But in a tortuous use of double negatives, it warned that there was ''no compelling evidence suggesting that these effects do not also occur at low doses.''</p>
        <p>It said that continuous exposure to  low doses of hormones was likely to add to long-term health risks, but said this risk ''as yet, cannot be quantified.''</p>
        <p>Unlike many other trade disputes, the battle over beef hormones has little or nothing to do with protecting local producers. A recent poll, commissioned by the European Commission, found that two-thirds of 16,000 people queried said they preferred hormone-free food.</p>
        <p>''These cases have a lot to do with ideology,'' said Stefan Tangermann, a professor of agricultural economics at the University of Gottingen in Germany. ''The real problem is that European consumers are deeply concerned about these issues, and the public expects politicians to protect their interests.''</p>
