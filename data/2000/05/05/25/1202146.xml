        <p>In 1936 Diana Mitford Guinness married Oswald Mosley, Britain's foremost fascist, at the Berlin home of Josef and Magda Goebbels. The bride wore yellow silk.

When she created a stir, not long before the wedding, by raising her hand in a fascist salute in Hyde Park during the singing of ''God Save the King,'' she said: ''I simply wanted to give my opinion like everyone else.''  When she began humiliating her first husband, an heir to the Guinness brewery fortune, by conducting an affair with Mosley, she supposed that Mrs. Mosley would probably not mind.

        <p>DIANA MOSLEY A Life</p>
        <p>By Jan Dalley</p>
        <p>Illustrated. Alfred A. Knopf. 318 pages. $27.50.</p>
        <p>In 1936 Diana Mitford Guinness married Oswald Mosley, Britain's foremost fascist, at the Berlin home of Josef and Magda Goebbels. The bride wore yellow silk. A guest at the small ceremony was her special friend Adolf Hitler, whose wedding gift was a large photograph of himself in a silver frame adorned by the two-headed German eagle. For years the Mosleys displayed this keepsake in their drawing room even though it prompted ''discomfiture,'' in the words of Diana's biographer, Jan Dalley, among ''some'' of their guests.</p>
        <p>But as Ms. Dalley makes clear, Diana was not one to fret about the delicate feelings of others. When she created a stir, not long before the wedding, by raising her hand in a fascist salute in Hyde Park during the singing of ''God Save the King,'' she said: ''I simply wanted to give my opinion like everyone else.''  When she began humiliating her first husband, an heir to the Guinness brewery fortune, by conducting an affair with Mosley, she supposed that Mrs. Mosley would probably not mind. ''What difference would it make?'' she later wondered, congratulating herself on the set of happy remarriages that ensued.</p>
        <p>And when, after World War II, she and Mosley found themselves somewhat ostracized in the Wiltshire countryside, Diana's patrician diffidence remained supreme. ''The local colonels did not come to call,'' she observed. There was no love lost between the Britain that had imprisoned the Mosleys during World War II and two people who clung unapologetically to their polarizing political views. ''What else was there?'' she asked late in life, by way of explaining how her fascist allegiances were born.</p>
        <p>Diana Mosley's detachment, and the glaring degree to which her biographer becomes complicit in it, resonate throughout this morally tone-deaf book. It's clear that this dauntless creature, now on the eve of her 90th birthday, has always exerted a powerfully seductive pull. She was part of the much-documented Mitford brood of beautiful, headstrong sisters (Dina, Dana, Bodley, Honks, Cord and Nard were all childhood nicknames for Diana -- and that was just within the family) and thus came equipped with attributes that make her a hagiographer's dream. A biographer ready to describe Oswald Mosley, the founder of the British Union of Fascists, as ''handsome in the Rudolph Valentino style then in fashion, elegant, witty and very charming to women'' is well equipped to celebrate her subject's social and cosmetic virtues.</p>
        <p>Diana was a cousin of Winston Churchill's, a darling of Evelyn Waugh's (who dedicated ''Vile Bodies'' to the Guinnesses) and an unlikely friend of Lytton Strachey's and Dora Carrington's, even if she found Bloomsbury tastes ''dreary'' and ''middle-class''; Diana's own aesthetic ran toward pink, blue and gold luxe.</p>
        <p>It's possible that she might have led a life devoid of controversy without Mosley's influence, even though one of her grandfathers was one of Hitler's favorite Germanophiles and  her father hatched a gold-mining scheme in a Canadian locale called Swastika.</p>
        <p>But Diana, as Ms. Dalley sees it, ''had an idealistic tendency to hero-worship that welcomed the idea of a single, strong leader who would accomplish wonderful things.'' And Ms. Dalley regards Diana's political conversion as a positive step in character development. ''Most people rebel from the workaday aspects of life toward the more lighthearted,'' she writes. ''In choosing Mosley and fascism, Diana rebelled away from the frivolity of her socializing life into 'seriousness of purpose.' ''</p>
        <p>At least her purposes were more serious than those of her sister Unity Mitford, whose groupie tactics (she was known to stake out Hitler's favorite lunch spot in Munich, quivering in hopes of an autograph) were treated as Mitford family foolishness. (''She was still a handful at home; at least now she was interested in something,'' says Ms. Dalley, of the period in the early 1930's when Unity made herself a fixture with the German high command.) The book argues that Diana could be helpful to Mosley by forming close contacts in Hitler's circle, and that she was characteristically oblivious when it came to warmongering in the wind.</p>
        <p>''Diana's enthusiasm for Germany was not dimmed by reports of the Night of the Long Knives,'' Ms. Dalley reports, in a book that uses the phrase ''the Jewish question'' in passing. There is much more about what Diana either did not notice or did not mind. Ms. Dalley is careful to attach a veneer of principle to such thoughts, as in explaining how Diana still managed to have several Jewish friends. ''Although Diana shared the same sense of deep differences between races and nationalities, and would unashamedly admit to racialism'' (''I am not fond of Jews,'' she unsurprisingly told a government interrogator in 1940), ''she would put a personal friendship before all that. But her liking for an individual would not change her views about the mass.''</p>
        <p>Not often does the book address ''the breathtaking illogic'' of Diana's thinking. Nor does it raise much of an eyebrow at Diana's selective memories. (Hitler was capable of ''marvelous drollery'' and did a delightful Mussolini impersonation.) Ms. Dalley prefers to laud her subject for the way ''a laconic irony -- always coolheaded, effective both in  attack and defense -- seemed bred in the bone.'' She also makes unsubstantiated claims for Diana's writing talents based on ''A Life of Contrasts,'' the memoir upon which this book draws. Only in citing how Diana ''showed great agility for dancing around what she called 'the tricky bits' '' does Ms. Dalley deliver a compliment that sounds deeply deserved.</p>
        <p>After the Mosleys' wartime incarceration, in a jail whose sooty soil Diana remembers as wonderful for growing fraises des bois, Oswald turned his attention to opposing immigration by blacks, although ''his oratorical style got the better of him when he was in full flood from the back of a lorry.'' Diana wrote her memoir and a book about a kindred spirit, the Duchess of Windsor. Oswald, who died in 1980, had a memoir of his own published in 1968 and was subjected to ''very very hostile'' questioning when he came to New York to promote it. As Diana remembers it, ''he didn't mind.''</p>
