        <p>A VOTE of confidence from Cisco Systems can be very important to fledging technology companies, especially if they have initial public offerings on the horizon.</p>
        <p>Just how important? Ask Selectica, a San Jose, Calif., company that makes software to help businesses sell complex products over the Internet. Selectica was so eager to make Cisco a customer that in a recent deal, it wound up paying Cisco to take its software.</p>
        <p>In January, only a couple of months before its public offering, Selectica proudly announced that its system had been chosen to run Cisco's World Wide Web site. Cisco, currently the world's second-largest technology company in market value, is the leading manufacturer of Internet equipment and will sell more than $15 billion of its routers and switches over its Web site this year.</p>
        <p>Selectica noted that Cisco's imprimatur had come after ''a six-month evaluation cycle and successful pilot implementation.'' The contract gave the company instant credibility with other potential customers -- and potential investors. In the marketing of its stock offering to institutional investors -- the ''road show'' -- Selectica executives pointed out that they had contracts with two of the world's leading technology companies, Cisco and Dell Computer, which will use Selectica's software on part of its Web site, according to investors who saw the presentations.</p>
        <p>That support resonated with potential investors. Even those very sophisticated about technology acknowledge that the complexity of modern software leaves them generally unable to judge the technical merits of competing products. So the verdict of widely respected companies like Dell and Cisco is extremely important, said Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter.</p>
        <p>On March 10, Selectica became one of the hottest initial public offerings of the year. It had first planned to offer its shares in the range of $9 to $11 each, but scorching demand enabled the underwriters to raise the offering price to $30. On Selectica's first day of trading, the shares soared as high as $154. At that price, Selectica was valued at more than $5 billion, 300 times its revenue for the preceding 12 months.</p>
        <p>But there was something that Selectica did not disclose in its press release announcing the software sales to Cisco. As part of the deal, Selectica sold Cisco warrants for 800,000 shares of its stock, a sweetener that has proved to be worth much more than the software contract.</p>
        <p>Selectica's action is not without precedent. Big companies often use their leverage to take stakes in would-be suppliers, especially in the technology business. But these deals are usually portrayed as partnership agreements or strategic investments, and they usually take the form of a direct investment by the larger company.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Selectica, which disclosed the warrants in a few sentences in its book-length registration statement, explicitly linked the warrants to the licensing deal. ''On Jan. 7, in connection with a license agreement, we issued a warrant to purchase 800,000 shares of common stock to Cisco, one of our customers, for $800,000,'' Selectica said.</p>
        <p>And by buying warrants instead of shares, Cisco assured itself of gaining from any increase in Selectica's stock price without taking on much risk, since it had effectively paid $1 a share.</p>
        <p>Thus far, the agreement has proved lucrative for Cisco, which will pay Selectica just $3 million this year for software and technical support.</p>
        <p>The warrants, which have a strike price of $13 and can be exercised beginning in January 2001, had a value of almost $24 million at Selectica's closing stock price of $42.625 yesterday.</p>
        <p>Cisco's gain, though, was Selectica's loss. In the quarter ending in March, Selectica reported a loss of $18 million on revenue of $7 million, largely because of the cost of the warrants.</p>
        <p>So did the warrants affect Cisco's decision to choose Selectica? Both companies say no, because Cisco would never jeopardize its enormous Internet sales for a short-term gain of a few million dollars. ''Cisco chose Selectica on the strength of its technology,'' a Cisco spokesman said.</p>
        <p>A Selectica spokeswoman said her company  was chosen from a pool of 30 competitors after a rigorous competition that lasted almost a year. ''Anybody who really knows Cisco knows you can't buy Cisco, especially for something that they identify as a core part of their business,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Cisco is not yet using Selectica's software to run its site. That will not happen until at least October, the companies said.</p>
        <p>The deal raised eyebrows even among supportive analysts. Near the end of its first research report on the company in April, US Bancorp Piper Jaffray, which helped underwrite Selectica's offering, tried to quantify the effect of the Cisco warrants, along with other, smaller sweeteners that Selectica offered Intel, Dell and Samsung.</p>
        <p>''There's definitely a financial impact to the warrants,'' said Michael Marzolf, a Piper Jaffray research analyst. Still, Mr. Marzolf said the long-run marketing benefits of winning Cisco and the other big companies as customers would outweigh the costs of the warrants, which he estimated at $35 million, or double Selectica's revenue for the recent fiscal year.</p>
        <p>Compared with traditional advertising, being able to use Cisco as a reference is extremely effective, Mr. Marzolf added.</p>
        <p>''I'm not saying that it isn't expensive, but I do think that it will pay off -- that it is paying off,'' Mr. Marzolf said. ''If Cisco is using Selectica to configure routers, 3Com looks at that and says, 'This stuff works, we're going to do this for ourselves as well.' ''</p>
