        <p>The Fox network, confirming weeks of speculation, announced yesterday the appointment of Gail Berman as president of entertainment for the network.</p>
        <p>Ms. Berman had been president of Regency Television, a production studio affiliated with Fox's own 20th Television. Regency this year created the television season's biggest new comedy hit, ''Malcolm in the Middle.''</p>
        <p>She replaces Doug Herzog, who held the position only 16 months. Ms. Berman will report to Sandy Grushow, who last November was named chairman of the Fox television entertainment group, a unit of the News Corporation. Mr. Grushow is the chief executive of both the Fox network and its production studio and Ms. Berman will report to him.</p>
        <p>Ms. Berman said she had had a strong working relationship with Mr. Grushow for the last two years and that she expected Mr. Grushow to ''move on to some larger issues in the company.'' As for her own role, she said, ''I have the mandate to run the network.'' She added, ''I feel totally comfortable with the arrangement.''</p>
        <p>Besides ''Malcolm,'' Regency developed a number of other successful shows during Ms. Berman's brief tenure there, including ''Roswell'' on WB, and two shows set for next season's network schedules, ''Fearsum'' on Fox and ''Tucker'' on NBC.</p>
        <p>Even as she ran Regency Television, Ms. Berman, in an unusual arrangement, had continued to serve as executive producer for two other series she had a hand in creating, ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' and ''Angel,'' both of which have been successes for the WB network.</p>
        <p>She said yesterday that with this appointment she would end her association with both those series.</p>
        <p>Ms. Berman's background is an unusual one for a television executive: she started out as producer of shows for Broadway. Among the theater pieces she had a hand in producing were the original Broadway production of ''Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat'' in 1980, David Rabe's ''Hurlyburly'' in 1984 and Athol Fugard's ''Blood Knot'' in 1985.</p>
