        <p>Ustad Amjad Ali Khan's concert at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday evening was a marvelous demonstration of the art of the sarod, an instrument that three centuries of tradition in India have contrived to make sound rather like an electric guitar, at least when amplification is used, as here it inevitably was.</p>
        <p>Like the electric guitar, the sarod is capable of imitating all the subtlety of the human voice: it can be a stalwart baritone or a keening soprano. Again like the electric guitar it can go way beyond the voice in terms of register and speed. The instruments are also similar in that both can produce a wide variety of colors and glissando effects, obtained by moving the fingers of one hand on the strings during the precious decay time after the other hand has done the plucking.</p>

        <p>Ustad Amjad Ali Khan's concert at Carnegie Hall on Tuesday evening was a marvelous demonstration of the art of the sarod, an instrument that three centuries of tradition in India have contrived to make sound rather like an electric guitar, at least when amplification is used, as here it inevitably was.</p>
        <p>Like the electric guitar, the sarod is capable of imitating all the subtlety of the human voice: it can be a stalwart baritone or a keening soprano. Again like the electric guitar it can go way beyond the voice in terms of register and speed. The instruments are also similar in that both can produce a wide variety of colors and glissando effects, obtained by moving the fingers of one hand on the strings during the precious decay time after the other hand has done the plucking.</p>
        <p>Mr. Khan's were the right hands to be doing these things. In the two ragas he performed in the first half, his playing in the early slow sections had sounds wafting in the air, beautifully tuned and often leaving delectable trails of glissando behind them. The note might skid up, down and back again all in half a second, everything achieved with perfect control and judgment.</p>
        <p>Accompaniment in the fast metrical continuations came from two different percussion instruments. In the first raga Tanmoy Bose played the relatively familiar tabla, or small pair of drums, with exquisite gentleness and hands flickering on the skins. Mr. Khan agreeably allowed him his solo opportunities. But in the second raga his partnership with Fateh Singh Gangani on the less usual pakhawaj -- a hollow log drum with a skin at each end -- was more one of two travelers journeying together, or dancing together, the sound of the sarod folding into that of its sonorous companion.</p>
        <p>In the second half, Mr. Khan was joined by his two sons, Amaan Ali Bangash and Ayaan Ali Bangash, both also playing the sarod as coming masters of at least the fifth generation. This was a chance to watch the handing down of skills from teacher to apprentice. Mr. Khan would play something and have one of the young men imitate him. If they seemed hesitant, he would repeat the difficult interval. But he was also obviously pleased when they took off on their own; the performance ended in a jam session, with both percussionists also involved in exciting and humorous dialogue.</p>
        <p>At one point, Mr. Khan invited his audience to visit his family home, now a sarod museum. Those who cannot get to India, he disarmingly pointed out, can make the trip in spirit -- at www.sarod.com.</p>
