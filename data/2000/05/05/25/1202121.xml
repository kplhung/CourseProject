        <p>THIS is Special Agent Perfect Dark,'' a female voice with a British accent said in a telephone message left at my home last week. ''I must be brief -- you never know who's listening. I need your assistance.''</p>
        <p>The message caught me off guard -- for an instant, I actually wondered how ''they'' knew that I was playing Perfect Dark at that moment. Then I realized that it was just a public relations stunt from Nintendo, so I immersed myself once more in the game's alternate reality, which is every bit as exciting and nerve-racking as a fast-paced action film.</p>

        <p>THIS is Special Agent Perfect Dark,'' a female voice with a British accent said in a telephone message left at my home last week. ''I must be brief -- you never know who's listening. I need your assistance.''</p>
        <p>The message caught me off guard -- for an instant, I actually wondered how ''they'' knew that I was playing Perfect Dark at that moment. Then I realized that it was just a public relations stunt from Nintendo, so I immersed myself once more in the game's alternate reality, which is every bit as exciting and nerve-racking as a fast-paced action film.</p>
        <p>Designed by Rare, a British company, Perfect Dark -- the name refers to the code name used in the game for the 23-year-old heroine, Joanna Dark -- draws its look and feel from the company's 1997 spy hit, Golden Eye, a game that featured James Bond but had comparatively stiff animation. The company deserves kudos for casting a female character in the lead role in an industry dominated on both sides of the screen by young men.</p>
        <p>Striking a balance between sharpshooting and sleuthing, Joanna is years ahead of Bond in her outing, set 23 years from now. The first-person action of Perfect Dark -- which is not a Bond sequel and has no characters from that game -- unfolds in a science fiction-flavored landscape that features better graphics, sound effects, weapons and gadgets than Bond's game.</p>
        <p>There are nine Solo Missions, each with levels of three to five objectives, depending on the difficulty setting selected. The first mission begins simply enough: Infiltrate the headquarters of the secretive, sinister dataDyne company and rescue a doctor being held hostage. In the first of many plot twists, the doctor turns out to be a sentient robot that is imprisoning the soul of a scientist in a roaming device that displays only the doctor's wide, staring eyes, which are strangely, unsettlingly pretty, as if they had been through a Cover Girl makeover.</p>
        <p>Along the way, Joanna must sneak past enemies or, more often than not, shoot them. These bad guys are markedly smarter than Golden Eye's villains. They hide in corners or duck behind boxes, waiting for the vulnerable moment as you, playing Joanna, are reloading so they can pop out and get you in their sights.</p>
        <p>How smart the enemies are -- and how many mission objectives there are -- depends on the difficulty setting chosen at the start of the mission. (A note to parents: the enemies' equally smart mouths contribute to the game's Mature rating.)</p>
        <p>That is not to say that the Agent setting is a walk in the park. It's hard, not only because swarms of deadly enemies must be eliminated, but also because shooting accurately at bad guys takes enormous amounts of practice on the Nintendo 64 controller. As a player more attuned to fast 3-D action games on PC's, I found that adjusting to the Nintendo 64 controller was like trying to tie shoelaces with fingers soaked in Novocain.</p>
        <p>Practice pays off. Before long it feels more natural to be sneaking around as Joanna achieves increasingly complicated objectives. She goes undercover to free hostages, travels underground to infiltrate a lab and dives into the sea to recover an alien who goes by the name of Elvis. Fans of conspiracy theories get a visit to not only Area 51, but to Area 52, too.</p>
        <p>The environments depicted in Perfect Dark are gorgeous, as long as the player has upgraded the Nintendo 64 with an optional memory Expansion Pak, which costs $29.95 and also improves the graphics of some other games, like Quake II and South Park Rally. Without it, only a third of Perfect Dark can be played -- it has the multiplayer levels but none of the single-player missions. With the Expansion Pak installed, the game has vibrant effects.</p>
        <p>Light sources give off a squint-inducing glare and can be shot out to darken a room, causing enemies to scramble. Windows shatter with  Dolby Surround Sound (if your television is equipped with it), and, yes, blood splatters the walls and floors behind and beneath enemies on the receiving end of your arsenal.</p>
        <p>An assortment of gadgets lets the player see in the dark or decode computer-locked doors; other gadgets cloak Joanna from sight. The most ingenious and captivating gadget is the Camspy, a controllable spy camera that Johanna sets loose to see in places she can't go.</p>
        <p>Perfect Dark isn't without its frustrations. There is no Save Game feature within levels, so dying during a mission means going back to its beginning and starting over. (Only completed levels are saved.) Because each game has up to five objectives, the inability to save the game in the middle of a mission is at times infuriating.</p>
        <p>One way to double Joanna's odds of completing the single-player levels is to play in cooperative mode. That lets you invite a friend to play at Joanna's side, helping you take out the enemies and complete objectives. Or you can enlist the aid of one of the game's ''simulants,'' which are designed to act like human players. An interesting twist on the co-op mode is the counter-op mode, in which the second player acts on behalf of one of the level's enemies and tries to keep Joanna from getting out of the level alive.</p>
        <p>Players who are frustrated from dying too often in the middle of more complicated single-player levels can let off steam in the game's biggest surprise of all, its multiplayer levels. In design and execution, they evoke the feeling of two heavy-hitting PC multiplayer games, Quake III and Unreal Tournament.</p>
        <p>As many as four human players seated around a single Nintendo 64 console can go head to head, each taking up a quarter of the TV screen while following one character's actions. The game slows down noticeably when several players are on the screen, all shooting at once.</p>
        <p>Up to eight additional computer-generated players, or simulants, can be sprinkled into the game. Or solo players can play against one or several simulants. Simulants can be tweaked to be aggressive or meek. Or the simulant can be insane, blowing up both itself and you when you meet it head-on.</p>
        <p>With an abundance of multiplayer levels and the option of returning to the Solo Missions and playing the game all over again at one of the more difficult settings, Perfect Dark is one of those rare games with lots of replay value. While faults like the inability to save the game in the middle of levels prevent it from being perfect, Perfect Dark comes close.</p>
        <p>Perfect Dark, from Nintendo for Nintendo 64; $69.95; for ages 17 and up.</p>
