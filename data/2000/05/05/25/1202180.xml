        <p>The best national missile defense requires a bold rhetorical offense.</p>
        <p>George W. Bush and a phalanx of famed cold warriors brought it off this week. They denounced the arms-control doves seeking to curry favor with Vladimir Putin at the forthcoming Moscow summit meeting as -- hold your breath -- a pack of unreconstructed cold-war relics.</p>
        <p>For years, those who dared propose a limited missile defense of American cities against rogue nations or terrorists drew brickbats from accommodationists. Withdrawal from the outdated ABM treaty would upset the Russians, we were warned, and thereby stop Start (the strategic arms treaties).</p>
        <p>With Bill Clinton's election, a compromise was struck: the U.S. would spend tens of billions in research developing a limited defense against a few missiles from Iraq or North Korea, but one that would not pose a threat to the thousands of Russian ICBM's.</p>
        <p>Even this half-loaf was to be half-baked. Because the president was skeptical of our technology and unwilling to offend his left by countering the mounting danger, the U.S. poked along with no sense of urgency. Even if our limited system were to work, Clinton never intended to risk Russian disapproval by deploying it.</p>
        <p>But now, with the C.I.A. estimating nuclear blackmail from rogue states as a distinct possibility, Congressional and public opinion is putting pressure on Clinton for action.</p>
        <p>His grudging response, outlined in this space last month, was to seek a weak deal with Putin at the summit. Allow us to make minor changes in the ABM treaty, enabling us to put up a puny defense, was the Clinton idea; in return, we will reduce our missile force in the Start III treaty all the way down to the level the Russian military can afford.</p>
        <p>Senator Jesse Helms saw this bad ABM deal in prospect and announced that amendments tying the next president's hands would be ''dead on arrival'' in the Senate.</p>
        <p>That effectively exposed the Putin-Clinton dealing on ABM and Start III as a meaningless charade. But it posed a political appearance problem for the Bush campaign. How to oppose the summit stunt without seeming to be obstructionist, triumphalist, nasty to the Russians or, worst of all, subject to accusations of being an unreconstructed cold warrior?</p>
        <p>Bush's answer: First, trot out the heavy hitters who helped win the cold war. He lined up Nixon-Ford's  Henry Kissinger and Don Rumsfeld, Reagan's George Shultz, his father's Colin Powell and Brent Scowcroft. (No James Baker; forgot his phone number.) One by one, these mainly hard-line heroes endorsed the candidate's call for a limited antimissile system. Kissinger, who wrote the ABM treaty, asserted that it belonged to a long-gone bipolar world.</p>
        <p>But this performance by the Bush front-line brain trust was played with a remarkable rhetorical twist. Instead of hunkering down to await the usual ''unreconstructed cold warriors'' blast from the White House,  Bush charged the Clinton-Gore administration with being ''locked in a cold-war mentality.''</p>
        <p>That stole the opposition's clothes. Calling for ''a new era of nuclear security,'' Bush announced: ''The cold-war era is history. Our nation must recognize new threats, not fixate on old ones.'' He anticipated a knee-jerk Gore reaction with a built-in response: ''It is possible to build a missile defense and defuse confrontation with Russia. America should do both.''</p>
        <p>He then showed arms-control sophisticates he had an understanding of the potential Putin-Clinton summit dodge: ''Start III should not be an excuse to limit our ability to build a missile defense system.'' Rather than let a Russian deal on amending ABM determine the number of missiles in our arsenal, the U.S. military would determine how few are required for our security; Bush would then ask Russia to match the cuts.</p>
        <p>Bush also made plain what Clintonites know but won't admit: ''This administration is not fully devoted to the development of an antiballistic missile system that will work.''</p>
        <p>A serious issue is joined. Thanks to deft presentation, the Clinton-Gore side is the one lost in the mists of the old ''cold-war mentality.''</p>
