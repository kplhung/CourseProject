        <p>Monte/Brown Dance</p>
        <p>Joyce Theater</p>
        <p>Not all choreographers give dancers theatrical wedding presents. But when Yvette Perry, a member of Monte/Brown Dance, was married recently, David Brown, the group's co-director, created ''Joint Venture'' for her.</p>
        <p>When the curtain went up on Sunday, it soon became clear that this witty new dance to a recording of Ornette Coleman's ''Doughnut'' was no sugary choreographic wedding cake.

        <p>Monte/Brown Dance</p>
        <p>Joyce Theater</p>
        <p>Not all choreographers give dancers theatrical wedding presents. But when Yvette Perry, a member of Monte/Brown Dance, was married recently, David Brown, the group's co-director, created ''Joint Venture'' for her.</p>
        <p>When the curtain went up on Sunday, it soon became clear that this witty new dance to a recording of Ornette Coleman's ''Doughnut'' was no sugary choreographic wedding cake. Four men -- Fabrice Lamego, Brian McGinnis, Marden Ramos and Bradley Shelver -- all clad in simple costumes by Karen Young, were revealed standing in a line. Ms. Perry strode confidently in and brusquely shoved them aside.</p>
        <p>Then, as the jazz accompaniment grew increasingly boisterous, she danced with them one, by one. They twisted and swiveled her about with great force. Yet she remained undaunted. She grappled with them as if in a wrestling match, tackled one man as if playing football and lifted another.</p>
        <p>When all four men gathered back together, they raised and held her as if in a satiric contemporary commentary on the Rose Adagio in ''The Sleeping Beauty,'' a sequence in which four cavaliers support the heroine. But Mr. Brown's cavaliers eventually collapsed, while Ms. Perry was left standing proudly.</p>
        <p>Whichever cavalier eventually married this dance's modern princess would find himself wed to a woman of high spirits and inexhaustible energy.</p>
        <p>The matinee also included ''Audentity,'' ''Tears Rolling'' and ''Kaamos.'' The entire program was dedicated to the memory of Ina Shelver, Mr. Shelver's mother, who died on Saturday.</p>
