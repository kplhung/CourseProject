        <p>Prime Minister Ehud Barak warned Lebanon and Syria tonight that any cross-border attack on Israeli territory would be considered ''an act of war'' now that Israel has withdrawn from Lebanon, in a rush completed before dawn today.</p>
        <p>Generals vowed to retaliate against incoming rockets or artillery from Hezbollah guerrillas with strikes against Syrian military targets deep inside Lebanon.</p>
        <p>''The planes are ready,'' said Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, the Israeli military's chief of staff. ''The pilots are on call. Their quality is known.''</p>
        <p>The warnings suggested the degree to which Israel's enthusiasm over the safe return of its troops and the end of a costly occupation is undercut by a portent of tension.</p>
        <p>Along Israel's northern border, the recent bombing subsided into silence. But the few remaining residents were ordered into bomb shelters, and Israeli military warily watched Hezbollah forces without the constraints of Lebanese troops or United Nations peacekeepers.</p>
        <p>''The decision to withdraw is correct, but the implementation is miserable,'' Dan Naveh, an opposition legislator, said in a typical comment in Parliament.</p>
        <p>But by and large, Mr. Barak received credit for keeping his central campaign promise -- a full withdrawal from Lebanon -- a year after his pledge helped win his election.</p>
        <p>The few hundred remaining Israeli soldiers emerged from Lebanon before dawn today ''without a scratch,'' the prime minister boasted, and about 5,000 militia allies were given asylum in Israel.</p>
        <p>Newspapers that on Monday featured Kosovo-like portraits of fleeing refugees today printed their headlines in patriotic blue. ''Mom, We've Left Lebanon!'' declared a giant banner atop Yedioth Aronoth.</p>
        <p>Yet Mr. Barak appeared to be trying to tamp down the elation. ''This is a happy day and a painful day,'' he said on television tonight. ''Happy because we brought the boys home. Sad, because a thousand of our dear sons did not live to see this day.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak has shown a striking readiness to assign blame for renewed violence to President Hafez Assad of Syria. ''Any attack on the north will now be interpreted as an attack by Syria,'' said Itamar Rabinovich, a former Israeli ambassador to the United States and an expert on the Syrian regime. ''The dire warnings to Syria reflect the general sentiment that this could take us into the mouth of the abyss.''</p>
        <p>The Israeli presence in Lebanon acted as a constraint against an escalation of tensions with Syria, as troops in the zone were exposed to retaliation from the Hezbollah. But future Israeli attacks on Lebanese targets would be conducted principally from the air.</p>
        <p>Israel's overnight shift from a ground occupation strategy on the border to reliance on an aerial offense will limit casualties and accentuate its technological superiority, local analysts said.</p>
        <p>''For 18 years, Israel has been fighting a guerrilla war, a war of attrition, that nullifies all of its technological advantages,'' said Gerald Steinberg, a defense specialist at Bar-Ilan University. ''Now, by fighting from the air, Israel can use its real capabilities.''</p>
        <p>While the returning Israeli soldiers were welcomed across the country with family celebrations and politicians' applause, there was ambivalence in the reception given the 5,000 refugees from the South Lebanon Army.</p>
        <p>Some Israelis were angered that many militia members were captured by Hezbollah forces and turned over to Lebanese authorities. Antoine Lahad , the former commander of the militia, said today that Israel and the South Lebanon Army had ''worked together for 24 years, and then Israel decided within 24 hours to change direction.''</p>
        <p>The Israeli Interior Ministry today hastened to provide the militia members many of the benefits accorded immigrants here, including work visas, health insurance, temporary housing and help in finding jobs.</p>
        <p>''Israel will be tested on how we deal with them,'' said Ephraim Sneh, Israel's deputy defense minister.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak had become caustic in his condemnation of the original strategic logic of the occupation, contending that it had failed to protect northern border towns while causing the needless deaths of more than 900 Israeli soldiers and thousands of Lebanese combatants and civilians. His implicit target is the leader of the main right-wing opposition party, Ariel Sharon, the former defense minister who led a full-scale invasion into Lebanon in 1983.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sharon today called the withdrawal ''a disgraceful retreat.''</p>
        <p>''The government had 10 months to organize this, and if it had been organized right, Israeli weapons would not have fallen into Hezbollah hands,'' he said.</p>
