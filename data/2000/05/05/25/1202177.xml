        <p>In July 1948, the Republican presidential nominee, Thomas Dewey, met in Washington with two top advisers, John Foster Dulles and Senator Arthur Vandenberg, to decide what stance their party should take on one of the first showdowns of the cold war: the Soviet blockade of Berlin.</p>
        <p>Speaking to reporters afterward, Dewey, who had a substantial lead in the polls over the incumbent, Harry Truman, said that the Berlin crisis was so grave that it must be exempt from partisan wrangling.</p>
        <p>''The present duty of Americans is not to be divided by past lapses but to unite to surmount present danger,'' Dewey said. That policy of ''indispensable unity,'' he added, was ''the Vandenberg policy,'' meaning it bore a Republican stamp even though it had been formulated under Democratic administrations.</p>
        <p>Such words found an echo last week when Gov. George W. Bush sided with the Clinton administration in opposing a measure pushed by Senate Republicans that would have set a strict deadline for withdrawing American troops from Kosovo. He called it ''legislative overreach,'' which, if enacted, would hamper his ability to conduct policy should he be elected president in November. The bill failed, but 40 of the 55 Republican senators supported it.</p>
        <p>What exactly lay behind this rift between Mr. Bush and the Republican Congress? Important strategic or tactical differences? Evidently not.</p>
        <p>''What this is about on the Republican side is a deep dislike and distrust for President Clinton,'' explained Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, who voted against the Kosovo provision. It was a candid admission by a respected Republican lawmaker that many in his party have let their antipathy toward the president dictate their votes on issues normally considered above partisan bickering.</p>
        <p>This is not to say that Congress has no business disagreeing with the president on foreign policy. Legislative consultation is essential to strong, durable policy. There was far too little debate, to cite the most obvious example, when Lyndon Johnson began escalating the Vietnam War in 1965.</p>
        <p>Nor are presidential candidates barred from developing their own foreign policy ideas. On the contrary, as Mr. Bush's recent comments on nuclear security show, he is willing to state his differences with President Clinton on sensitive matters. But in doing so, he has sent a broader message of continuity, most obviously by appearing at a news conference on Tuesday with Henry Kissinger and Colin Powell, two Republicans who are respected by Democrats. Unlike Congressional Republicans, Mr. Bush seems to recognize the distinction between principled opposition and vengeful obstructionism, and to know how destructive the latter can be.</p>
        <p>Consider what happened after the 1948 election. Dewey didn't win, of course. Truman did. In their frustration, Republicans embarked on a mission to punish the Democrats. Some claimed the Truman administration had treasonously handed China over to the Communists in 1949. Then Senator Joseph McCarthy accused Secretary of State Dean Acheson and others of being servants of the Kremlin.</p>
        <p>It was slander, yet senior Republicans like Robert Taft tolerated and even egged on McCarthy's assaults. A few Republicans came forward to challenge McCarthy, but none had the stature of Arthur Vandenberg. He died in 1951, having supported Truman's cold war policies to the end.</p>
        <p>Democrats, too, have indulged in the politics of vengeance. In 1974 the ''Watergate Congress,'' seething with hatred of Richard Nixon, cut the lifeline to South Vietnam as it was about to be overrun by North Vietnamese troops. If not for President Gerald Ford, who insisted that South Vietnamese refugees be transported to the United States, many thousands more would have been killed or imprisoned.</p>
        <p>Senator Hagel hastens to assure us that Congressional Republicans are under control. ''If you have a President Bush,'' he said, ''you'll find all this settle down considerably.''</p>
        <p>But if we have President Gore instead, the Republicans might grow even testier, battling the perceived usurper at every juncture. Will they attack Mr. Gore just as McCarthy and company attacked Harry Truman, not only for his sins but for those committed by the popular president whose coattails he rode into office?  Senator Hagel's words seem to carry an implicit threat: If our guy doesn't win, more trouble will come.</p>
        <p>Republicans would do far better to follow Mr. Bush's lead, not only because it is more statesmanlike but because history is on his side. In staking out common ground with the current administration, Mr. Bush is aligning himself with Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan, all Republicans who came into office on the heels of Democratic presidents.</p>
        <p>Despite differences with their predecessors, each achieved triumphs by staying the course of a bipartisan foreign policy. And each had legislative help. If Mr. Bush is elected, he will need it, too. But he also needs it now if the country is to feel confident in Republican leadership. He needs an Arthur Vandenberg. Sadly, he doesn't appear to be in sight.</p>
