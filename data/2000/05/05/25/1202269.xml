        <p>China's currency, the yuan, edged further beyond its tight trading band to close at 8.2764 to the dollar, its strongest level since China unified its foreign exchange rate in 1994. For years, China's foreign exchange controls have kept the yuan trading between $8.2770 and $8.2800. And despite perceived pressure on the currency during Asia's recent financial crisis, Beijing kept its promise not to devalue the yuan. But the country is expected to ease control over the exchange rate gradually after it joins the World Trade Organization, with a goal of making the currency convertible.</p>
