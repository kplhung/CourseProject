        <p>Last Saturday, Esther Kim did an extraordinary thing at the Olympic tae kwon do trials in Colorado Springs. She forfeited a possible spot on the American team so that her injured friend, Kay Poe, could go instead to the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>Kim, 20, and Poe, 18, both live in Houston and are coached by Kim's father, Jin Won Kim. They have known each other for 13 years. Esther Kim said she loved Poe like a sister.

        <p>Last Saturday, Esther Kim did an extraordinary thing at the Olympic tae kwon do trials in Colorado Springs. She forfeited a possible spot on the American team so that her injured friend, Kay Poe, could go instead to the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>Kim, 20, and Poe, 18, both live in Houston and are coached by Kim's father, Jin Won Kim. They have known each other for 13 years. Esther Kim said she loved Poe like a sister. And she could not bring herself to fight an impaired friend in the final round of the flyweight competition at the Olympic trials.</p>
        <p>Tae kwon do will be a medal event for the first time at the Sydney Games in September. The players attack primarily with kicking maneuvers, as opposed to karate, which emphasizes the hands. Poe, the favorite for an Olympic gold medal, had dislocated her left kneecap in a semifinal match in the qualifying tournament. Afterward, she had to be carried down a flight of stairs on the back of her coach at the Olympic Training Center.</p>
        <p>Having reached the flyweight final, Poe was scheduled to face her close friend Kim, whom she had already defeated in an earlier round. But it was clear that Poe was in no condition to compete.</p>
        <p>''We have to fight,'' Poe said. ''I'll do the best I can.''</p>
        <p>''You can't even stand up,'' Kim replied. ''How are you going to fight?''</p>
        <p>Kim then said she wanted to forfeit. Poe disagreed, but Kim insisted. She said she thought to herself, ''I wouldn't be losing my dream, I'd be handing it to Kay.'' Poe started crying.</p>
        <p>''I really want to go to the Olympics, but it's not fair to go out with two legs and her with one leg,'' Kim told her father, who coaches both athletes. ''I couldn't live with myself knowing I beat someone who had already been beaten.''</p>
        <p>The Kims helped Poe to the mat, both athletes in tears, as the decision was announced.</p>
        <p>''It felt like the only right thing to do,'' Kim said yesterday. ''It did hurt, but winning a gold medal isn't everything. There are other ways to be a champion. If I don't have a gold medal around my neck, it's in my heart.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Poe said she would buy Kim a ticket to Sydney if tae kwon do officials did not. ''I'm so blessed to have a friend who would look after me like that,'' Poe said.</p>
        <p>Kim's gesture has come to be mostly lauded as an exceptional act of sportsmanship and selflessness while sports are plagued by scandal, commercialism and greed.</p>
        <p>''The relationship they developed transcended sport,'' Jay Warwick, executive director of the United States Tae Kwon Do Union, the sport's national governing body, said yesterday. ''To make that sacrifice is an incredible gesture. Sport now is so focused on winning and dollars and cents. When you see pure innocence demonstrated, it reminds you this is neat.''</p>
        <p>Donna Lopiano, executive director of the Women's Sports Foundation and a former professor of ethics at the University of Texas, said there was a clear distinction between the tae kwon do case and the incident in 1998 when an injured Nykesha Sales of Connecticut's basketball team was allowed an uncontested basket against Villanova in order to set a school scoring record.</p>
        <p>''That was a manufactured record, cheating in the clearest form,'' Lopiano said, while adding that she believed the tae kwon do case to be a ''wonderful gesture.'' However, Lopiano said, the tae kwon do union should not have put Poe in the position of having to fight while hurt until her friend decided to forfeit. A special exemption should have been made, she said, just as figure skating made an exception for Nancy Kerrigan after she was knee-whacked by associates of Tonya Harding during the 1994 Olympic trials.</p>
        <p>''To force an injured player to play is unconscionable,'' Lopiano said.</p>
        <p>A remark that Kim made on Saturday also raised a troubling issue about stereotypes regarding gender and sports, and about whether women can put competition above their relationships. ''Kay has always pushed a little harder, always wanted it a little more,'' Kim said of Poe. This broaches the issue of whether her decision was truly selfless or whether she feared going to the Olympics and failing, especially having replaced an injured gold-medal favorite.</p>
        <p>''I think it can be read both ways,'' said Mary Jo Kane, a sports sociologist at the University of Minnesota. ''It can show that friendship transcends a spot on the Olympic team. On the other hand, why would you do that? Is this a wonderfully selfless human interest story, or does it reinforce stereotypes that women aren't as competitive as men? On the one hand, it shows women have their priorities in order. On the other hand, you could say it reinforces stereotypes that women don't care about sports or winning as much as men. Is that a good or bad thing? I don't know.''</p>
        <p>In these cynical times, Kane added, ''Maybe it says more about us than it does about them.''</p>
