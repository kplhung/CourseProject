        <p>When the International Contemporary Furniture Fair started 12 years ago at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center, it was plenty contemporary -- at a time when arty furniture had few takers. International the fair was not. But this year at the fair, which ran from May 20 to 23, things shifted. It was overwhelmingly international and multilingual, and the out-there charm was replaced by cool modernism gone mainstream. In addition to the narrow booths with artist-merchants in funky casuals selling hand-wrought metal and wooden wares, there were polished displays presided over by men (yes, men) in excellent suits.</p>
        <p>Italian suits. Thanks to their national trade organizations, the Italians transformed one-quarter of the fair into their own corporate downtown: an airy, white textile cityscape demarcating two ''boulevards'' lined with spacious booths that featured long and wide all-white kitchens and all-white couches. The Italians showed 13 outrageously minimal kitchens in all, and all were made with the same unspoken design manifesto: the kitchen island is a huge kitchen altar. The secondary message seemed to be: don't forget to equip the sink with a giant faucet, with oar-like handle and massive sculptural rinse spray. ( 1 : Federico Ferretti at Gruppo Ferretti, whose kitchens can be found at the Palazzetti showroom in New York; 212-832-1199.) Oh, and the sink and counter must be a seamless whole (2 : At Boffi, which just opened a showroom at 31 1/2 Greene Street (Grand Street) designed by Antonio Citterio; 212-431-8282). And don't forget to cook! A booth served free pasta, allowing some to grace the gleaming model kitchens with real dining (6 : Loris Farina, left, and Sandro Puppa, two exhibitors). Others just scarfed down hoagies.</p>

        <p>When the International Contemporary Furniture Fair started 12 years ago at the Jacob K.

In addition to the narrow booths with artist-merchants in funky casuals selling hand-wrought metal and wooden wares, there were polished displays presided over by men (yes, men) in excellent suits.</p>
        <p>Italian suits. Thanks to their national trade organizations, the Italians transformed one-quarter of the fair into their own corporate downtown: an airy, white textile cityscape demarcating two ''boulevards'' lined with spacious booths that featured long and wide all-white kitchens and all-white couches. The Italians showed 13 outrageously minimal kitchens in all, and all were made with the same unspoken design manifesto: the kitchen island is a huge kitchen altar. The secondary message seemed to be: don't forget to equip the sink with a giant faucet, with oar-like handle and massive sculptural rinse spray. ( 1 : Federico Ferretti at Gruppo Ferretti, whose kitchens can be found at the Palazzetti showroom in New York; 212-832-1199.) Oh, and the sink and counter must be a seamless whole (2 : At Boffi, which just opened a showroom at 31 1/2 Greene Street (Grand Street) designed by Antonio Citterio; 212-431-8282). And don't forget to cook! A booth served free pasta, allowing some to grace the gleaming model kitchens with real dining (6 : Loris Farina, left, and Sandro Puppa, two exhibitors). Others just scarfed down hoagies.</p>
        <p>Hunkered into a smaller booth was a self-described months-old London company, Koi, formed by two former sculptors, Adam Bottomley and Kirsten Jones (5 ). They showed their first designs: a low dining chair for London's new Asian-style lofts, and a swivel chair made by a welder in London and a horse saddler in Kent ($595 to $722). Why leather? ''Because it's politically incorrect,'' Ms. Jones said. ''And we got tired of designing in plastics'': 011-44-207-249-5002.</p>
        <p>Nearby (4 ), bakerygroup, three Canadians in their 20's, two of them architects, showed its Light Volumes line: practical, elegant, inexpensive ambient lamps ($195 to $660) made of curved sheets of polypropylene encased in zippered, washable sleeves of microfiber polyester. The lamps can stack high, hang on the wall or stand on steel legs. The partners areMarcin Padlewski, left, Annisa Szeto and Michel Duvernet. Available from (877) 213-3099.</p>
        <p>Multi-sensory door handles ( 3 ) made of hand-finished resin -- bright, tactile, evocative -- were made by Poignee in London. Christian Migeon, a jewelry designer, conceived the handles in some 40 colors; knobs and levers, $85 each, from Haute Deco, 011-44-207-736-7171.</p>
        <p>Among the fair's most successful veterans were Marcus Santora and Janis Melone, of Santora Melone in New Haven, acclaimed as designer-cabinetmakers with pieces shaped and detailed in smart proportions (10 ). They used to do all the work themselves. ''Finally, we're in production!'' Ms. Melone said, since they found a tiny factory to make their designs. The door of their new mahogany armoire ($8,500) has two translucent panels -- one phenolic resin (used for circuit boards), the other, ribbed glass: (203) 865-2338.</p>
        <p>There were three categories of nouveau oldies: animated retros, genuine repros and faux-futuristics. The bracing Oasi chair and ottoman (7 ), designed by Ross Lovegrove for Frighetto, caricatures 60's curves with a radically cantilevered back. The chair is $3,380, the ottoman $1,040 from DDC, 181 Madison (34th Street), 212-685-0800.</p>
        <p>Charles and Ray Eames mania persuaded Herman Miller for the Home to reissue the Eames Storage Unit ($3,000 for the three-level unit), designed by the couple in 1952 (8) . Available from www.hermanmiller.com or (800) 646-4400.</p>
        <p>Futurism -- or at least a nostalgic take on it -- was the style of the Urburbia line commissioned by Dune, the Manhattan producer. Michael Solis designed the magic Four-Forty coffee table (9 ), which opens up to swallow clutter. At Dune, 50 East Houston Street (Mulberry Street), 212-925-6171. Pure fun. Granted, fun is merely one component of good design, but isn't that what separates delight from just fancy construction? Each year, the fair delivers, always in unpredictable ways.</p>
        <p>CURRENTS: INTERNATIONAL CONTEMPORARY FURNITURE FAIR  Correction:  June 1, 2000, Thursday  A report in the Currents column last Thursday about the new Boffi kitchen showroom in SoHo misidentified its designer. He is Piero Lissoni, not Antonio Citterio.</p>
