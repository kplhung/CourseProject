        <p>Any irritation the Knicks' Patrick Ewing had concerning his 34 minutes of playing time Tuesday night -- which included a late entrance into the fourth quarter of Game 1 against the Indiana Pacers -- seemed to subside today.</p>
        <p>''I'm not worried about it,'' said Ewing, who averaged 37 minutes in the Miami Heat series. ''When I'm on the court, I'm going to do the best I can do.''</p>
        <p>With a 21-point performance, Ewing was the Knicks' most effective offensive weapon in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals.</p>
        <p>But as the Knicks' deficit went from 6 points to 11 in the opening minutes of the fourth quarter, Coach Jeff Van Gundy waited until 7 minutes 26 seconds was left in the game to put Ewing into the lineup.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Ewing was edgy when asked about his playing time. Today, Van Gundy said he had no second thoughts about how he used Ewing on Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>In some ways, Ewing struggled as much defensively as he succeeded offensively. Ewing was too slow to reach Rik Smits as he drifted outside of the paint and released a flurry of jumpers on his way to 10 first-quarter points. Smits finished with 16 points in 19 minutes.</p>
        <p>''He is not as mobile,'' Smits said. ''But he's still strong, has a good touch around the basket, and he's still aggressive. I expect him to come out and attack more in Game 2.''</p>
        <p>Smits made life difficult for Ewing. When Smits was on the floor, Ewing could not post up and had a difficult time getting his jumper off in front of the 7-foot-4-inch center. Ewing began the game shooting 1 for 4. But when Smits found foul trouble, and Dale Davis moved over to cover Ewing, the Knick began to bang his way into the post.</p>
        <p>Ewing slipped inside of Davis for a number of layups that seemed to jump-start his offense and pull the team within striking distance of the Pacers at the end of the first half. His defense, though, was still underwhelming.</p>
        <p>Rose Gains Honor</p>
        <p>Jalen Rose was named the league's most improved player today. He averaged career highs of 18.2 points, 4.8 rebounds and 37.2 minutes per game. Last year, he averaged 11.1 points, 1.5 rebounds and 26.7 minutes each night.</p>
        <p>Becoming a starter had a lot to do with his production, but the fact that Reggie Miller was willing to step back on let his teammate develop also allowed Rose to flourish as the team's leading scorer.</p>
