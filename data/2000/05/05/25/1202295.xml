        <p>The highest court of the Presbyterian Church (USA), a denomination long divided on issues of homosexuality, ruled today that its ministers may conduct religious ''holy union'' ceremonies for same-sex couples, as long as the ceremonies are not regarded as marriages.</p>
        <p>Although the decision was made by the church's highest court, it is not the last word on the matter.</p>
        <p>The court said the only way now to ban holy union ceremonies was to change the church's Book of Order, or constitution, which currently prohibits same-sex marriages but says nothing about holy unions.</p>
        <p>Three regions of the church plan to propose such a constitutional ban at the meeting of the Presbyterian Church's General Assembly, which begins on June 24 in Long Beach, Calif.</p>
        <p>''We're very pleased with the decision,'' said Scott Anderson, co-moderator of More Light Presbyterians, a group that advocates gay rights in the church. ''But nothing is ever definitive in the Presbyterian Church. The General Assembly is going to be dealing with the holy union issue in Long Beach, and we are prepared for that.''</p>
        <p>The case originated with a holy union ceremony for two men at South Presbyterian Church in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., in 1998. A conservative minister at another church read an article about the couple in a local newspaper and brought suit in church courts against the minister who had performed the ceremony.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, I'm disappointed,'' said the Rev. Marc G. Benton, of Bethlehem Presbyterian Church, in New Windsor, N.Y., who brought the suit. ''The difficulty is that nobody on my side of the complaint knows what makes up holy union ceremonies. The line is as blurry as the pastor who is performing the ceremony wants to make it.''</p>
        <p>''My suspicion is that some pastors perform what is basically a wedding and call it a holy union ceremony,'' Mr. Benton said, adding that he was opposed to either ceremony for gay couples because ''that is based upon what we believe God has said'' in the Bible.</p>
        <p>In its ruling, the high court directed church districts to clarify the distinction between weddings and holy unions.</p>
        <p>The court said, ''Ministers should not appropriate specific liturgical forms from services of Christian marriage or services recognizing civil marriage in the conduct of such ceremonies. They should also instruct same-sex couples that the service to be conducted does not constitute a marriage ceremony and should not be held out as such.''</p>
        <p>The case was one of three involving gay issues argued before the church's high court, whose 16 members each represent one geographic division of the Presbyterian Church, which has 2.6 million members.</p>
        <p>In the second case, the court ruled that a gay candidate for the ministry who said he did not plan to remain celibate should not be dropped from candidacy. Church rules require clergy members to observe ''fidelity in marriage'' or ''chastity in singleness.''</p>
        <p>The high court ruled that the ministry candidate's behavior should be evaluated just before ordination, and not during candidacy.</p>
        <p>The court did not rule on the third case.</p>
        <p>Gay marriages and ordinations have become watershed issues for many mainline Protestant denominations in the last two decades.</p>
