        <p>When United Airlines and US Airways tried to merge in 1995, objections from United's employees, who own 55 percent of the company, scuttled the deal. A big question is whether employees will block the current deal.</p>
        <p>James E. Goodwin, the chairman and chief executive of the UAL Corporation, which operates United Airlines, voiced optimism yesterday about the reaction of his airline's labor unions to the proposed acquisition of the US Airways Group. He even ventured that the powerful pilots' union, ''supports the deal strategically,'' but warned about other issues, like combining the seniority lists for the two airlines.</p>
        <p>But Rick Dubinsky, the chairman of the master executive council of the airline pilots' union at United, said the union had not signed off on the latest merger attempt. ''I am deeply disappointed that the company would enter into a transaction of this magnitude without reaching full agreement with the United pilot group on all issues,'' he said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Officials from the International Association of Machinists and the Association of Flight Attendants, as well as the pilots' union at US Airways, were more cautious yesterday in reacting to the deal. But an airline union lawyer predicted that they too would have concerns about the merger.</p>
        <p>''I can't believe, if you go down the ranks of the airlines' three unions, that this is going to be an easy merger,'' said the lawyer, who insisted on anonymity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dubinsky and John Peterpaul, a retired vice president for transportation at the machinists' union, are both on United's board. But spokesmen for the machinists' union and the United pilots insisted that even if Mr. Dubinsky or Mr. Peterpaul knew about the proposed merger before the United board approved it on Tuesday evening, they did not tell their union colleagues about it, nor would they have the authority to make commitments on behalf of their unions without consultation.</p>
        <p>''Rick, as a member of the board, has a fiduciary responsibility to maintain confidentiality,'' said Kenneth Bradley, a United captain and spokesman for the United chapter of the Air Line Pilots Association, the national pilots' union.</p>
        <p>Rick Palmer, a spokesman for the machinist's union, said, ''This kind of just got sprung on us.'' Mr. Palmer added that when it came to United's board, Mr. Peterpaul, ''doesn't consult with us on how he votes.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Dubinsky and Mr. Peterpaul are crucial to the deal because the approval of at least one of the two union representatives on United's board is required for large corporate transactions, under the terms of the company's employee stock-ownership plan. But both men are legally obliged to vote in the interests of all shareholders, even if this may conflict with the interests of their unions, although balancing these interests is a matter of judgment. Neither man was available yesterday for interviews.</p>
        <p>The acceptance or rejection of the pact by United's 10,000 pilots will be critical, labor officials said. The United pilots own 46 percent of the employee stock-ownership plan set up in 1994. Because the stock-ownership plan, in turn, owns 55 percent of United, this means that the pilots own a quarter of the company. The machinists own 37 percent of the employee stock-ownership plan, salaried nonunion employees own the remaining 17 percent. United's flight attendants are not part of the plan.</p>
        <p>The pilots are also in the middle of negotiations with United on a new labor agreement, and have been divided on how aggressively to bargain. Mr. Dubinsky, who led a strike against United in 1985, won election to the local union chairmanship last year with a reputation for toughness, returning after an absence to a job he had held twice before.</p>
        <p>United and its pilots have agreed this year to begin meeting with a federal mediator on June 5, after 17 months of bargaining with little progress. When the most recent six-year labor contract lapsed on April 12, United's pilots dropped back to what they were earning in 1993, before the contract was signed.</p>
        <p>Even before the contract lapsed, United pilots were earning slightly less than US Airways pilots. The United pilots are demanding raises that would make them the highest-paid pilots in the industry. That raises the ticklish issue of whether to pay the same to pilots from both airlines or to introduce a two-tier pay structure, an arrangement the national pilots' union has tried to limit.</p>
        <p>The possibility of combining seniority lists with US Airways is another concern of United pilots. Airlines use seniority to determine who flies popular routes at convenient times and who is stuck flying to undesirable locations on holidays. Seniority is also an important factor in deciding which pilots are captains and which are first officers. This makes an enormous difference in pilots' pay: captains earn $160,000 to $230,000 at US Airways right now, while first officers earn $100,000 to $120,000.</p>
        <p>''Pilot seniority is really sacred, that dictates every aspect of a pilot's career,'' said Mr. Bradley, who flies Boeing 757's and 767's for United.</p>
        <p>Combining seniority lists is seldom a straightforward question of just figuring out who was hired first by which airline. This is particularly true for US Airways, which is the product of a series of airline mergers that were followed by complicated combinations of seniority lists. US Airways' purchase of the shuttle linking Washington, New York and Boston several years ago provoked a bitter dispute among pilots of the airline and the shuttle.</p>
        <p>The dispute ended up going to an arbitrator, who ruled last year that anyone who had been a captain at the shuttle would remain a captain of the combined airline, even if this meant putting them in seniority lists ahead of people who had spent more years as pilots at US Airways.</p>
        <p>Some of the shuttle service's pilots are survivors of the bankruptcy of Eastern Airlines, and pose some of the thorniest issues of all for the pilots of any airline merging with US Airways. Many of these shuttle pilots joined Eastern in the 1960's. They lost much of their seniority when Donald J. Trump bought the Eastern shuttle in 1989. Mr. Trump later sold the shuttle to a holding company, which sold it to US Airways.</p>
        <p>But the former Eastern pilots from the shuttle are unlikely to be treated as having more seniority than pilots at United Airlines, which hired many of its pilots in the 1970's and 1980's. When United hired 700 Eastern pilots following Eastern's bankruptcy in 1989, the United pilots insisted that the Eastern pilots lose all their seniority and work their way up from the bottom of United's seniority list as though they were rookies.</p>
        <p>Complicating matters is the plan by United and US Airways to spin off US Airways' nonshuttle flights out of Washington into a new airline. This would require a separate seniority list and a decision on which pilots would go to the smaller airline, which might be less financially stable.</p>
        <p>Roy Freundlich, a spokesman for the US Airways pilots, said the pilots' master executive council at US Airways was determined to look out for the airline's pilots in any combination of seniority lists. ''The attitude is one of caution,'' he said.</p>
        <p>US Airways' labor contract with its pilots still has another three years to go before either side can reopen it. Neither the United nor US Airways pilots could readily go on strike even if they objected to the proposed merger. The airline industry is covered by the Railway Labor Act, which requires extensive mediation and a cooling-off period before transportation workers are allowed to walk off the job.</p>
        <p>United pilots are likely to give extra scrutiny to the deal because the US Airways chief executive is Stephen M. Wolf, who was United's chief executive in the early 1990's and had a bitter relationship with the pilots. But Mr. Wolf said yesterday that he would leave as soon as a merger was concluded.</p>
