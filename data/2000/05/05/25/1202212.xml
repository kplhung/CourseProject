        <p>WHILE Jalen Rose received his most improved player award yesterday, the proud veteran he replaced got his shooting in.

        <p>WHILE Jalen Rose received his most improved player award yesterday, the proud veteran he replaced got his shooting in. For all his years as a starter, an All-Star, Chris Mullin was always last man out of the practice gym. Why change now, just because he couldn't tell you when he might put it to use?</p>
        <p>''You never know what's going to come up,'' Mullin said, running his hand through his haircut in the familiar flat-top.</p>
        <p>Larry Bird might call on him tonight in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals against the Knicks. Probably not, though. Rose was given Mullin's minutes this season and proved he deserved them. Not surprisingly, Mullin accepted his demotion to 11th player in the Pacers' 10-man rotation with dignity, with class, with his most unattractive thoughts kept to himself.</p>
        <p>''There's different emotions,'' he said. ''One thing I've learned, to not act on your initial ones. Let them play out.''</p>
        <p>Could Patrick Ewing hold his thoughts and tongue? John Stockton? Karl Malone? There was a time not too long ago when Chris Mullin was equal to them all, their original Dream Team peer.</p>
        <p>Even Bird by then could at best only match Mullin shot for shot.</p>
        <p>After the Pacers were beaten by the Knicks in last spring's conference finals, he knew it was just a matter of months before the coach would be coming to see him. Mullin wished to make it easy for Bird, his friend, by meeting him halfway.</p>
        <p>It was awkward, he admitted, but then Mullin said: ''I came here basically because of you. We've had two good years. It's his time.''</p>
        <p>It was time for the younger man, the prospective free agent, to grow into his game.</p>
        <p>Time for Mullin to do what always came naturally, play for the team, give up the ball. Surrendering the court -- that was something else entirely, though he hadn't kidded himself. Even as a kid in Brooklyn, he knew he couldn't play forever.</p>
        <p>At 37, Mullin was already feeling conflicted by the commitment, the travel, the opportunities missed at home. Why, just Tuesday, his oldest of three boys, 8-year-old Sean, demanded to know the reason his father would be the only one missing at a school presentation later that night. ''You know I have a game tonight,'' Mullin said.</p>
        <p>''But you don't even play,'' Sean said.</p>
        <p>Mullin didn't know what hurt more, the boy's disappointment or the realization that his sons would never see him as he once was, pumping in the southpaw jumpers, just as he watched Rose do in the second half of Indiana's Game 1 victory.</p>
        <p>''These kind of things, you can only look at them as helping you in dealing with life,'' he said.</p>
        <p>No matter how much pride he has swallowed, it isn't life and it isn't death, and how insignificant even this conference final rematch with the Knicks seemed when the telephone rang last Saturday and someone from the Pacers' organization delivered the news that Malik Sealy was dead.</p>
        <p>It was Mullin's job to telephone his brother Terrence, who had played with Sealy for four years at St. John's. His 30-year-old kid brother did not want to believe him. Car crash? Dead? How could this be? Just the day before, a letter had come to him from Minneapolis, a season-ending update from his good friend Malik.</p>
        <p>''I knew Malik from working out over the summers at St. John's,'' Mullin said. ''But Terrence loved him. I guess Malik had a big family, lots of siblings and relatives around New York, and Terrence used to say that seeing them reminded him of when it was me playing for St. John's.''</p>
        <p>In those days, the mid-1980's, Terrence Mullin was the kid in the green Celtics jacket whose favorite player was Bird. In many respects, Chris Mullin was a smaller version, though his career was never quite the storybook and was sometimes much worse. Chris battled alcoholism early on. Still in his prime, he buried his parents, Rod and Eileen, within a couple of years.</p>
        <p>Bird brought him to Indiana, and Mullin said he does not regret a single moment. He smiles every day when he walks into Conseco Fieldhouse, the New York gym rat in the ultimate Hoosier gym. He wants to play again next season, somewhere. He can still shoot. When Reggie Miller was ejected from Game 4 of the conference semifinals in Philadelphia, Bird sent Mullin into a game that was supposedly over. Mullin cranked up a couple of 3-pointers, a few jumpers. The Pacers almost won.</p>
        <p>That is what keeps him working, shooting, outlasting all the others on the Pacers' practice floor. There's another game tonight, and even if the 8-year-old at home knows he probably won't play, no one knows what the night will bring, what's going to come up. It's a team game, basketball is. A game of roles. Chris Mullin's role is to root, be ready, and keep his frustrations to himself.</p>
