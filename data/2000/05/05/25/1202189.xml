        <p>SO what if Bernadette Castro, into her sixth year as New York's vivacious and, when it comes to scaring up millions for pet projects, vociferous commissioner of parks, recreation and historic sites, wasn't always such a Campfire Girl? So what if the original Castro Convertible poster child still hooks more bushes than bass when she puts on her waders and, as parks poster woman, attempts the fly-fishing thing at Connetquot River State Park Preserve?</p>

        <p>SO what if Bernadette Castro, into her sixth year as New York's vivacious and, when it comes to scaring up millions for pet projects, vociferous commissioner of parks, recreation and historic sites, wasn't always such a Campfire Girl? So what if the original Castro Convertible poster child still hooks more bushes than bass when she puts on her waders and, as parks poster woman, attempts the fly-fishing thing at Connetquot River State Park Preserve?</p>
        <p>(For the record, she has caught an unremarkable brook trout. And thrown it back.)</p>
        <p>Back on dry land, she's had better luck. This spring, she led the task force that helped New York snag a $1.5 billion, 15-year Congressional appropriation from the underused Federal Land and Water Conservation Fund for future parks and recreation grants. Instead of throwing that one back, she's headed to the Senate soon to ensure that Congress's nature-loving deed is ratified there.</p>
        <p>And on Tuesday, she cut the ribbon at the Theodore Roosevelt Nature Center, a maritime-theme learning center for schoolchildren that her agency carved from a derelict building at Jones Beach: ''Thank you, Ford Motor Company, for $350,000; thank you, LIPA, for $350,000; and thank you, governor, for $200,000,'' she singsongs, making light, but not too light, of her skill at marrying the right fiscal muscle with right-minded projects.</p>
        <p>Ms. Castro is still chortling about the nine and a half acres of asphalt her crews replaced with sand and habitat grasses for piping plovers and other sea birds there: ''The governor hates asphalt.''</p>
        <p>To those skeptics who sniffed when her bird-loving patron, Gov. George E. Pataki, gave the well-heeled Castro Convertible Girl the outdoorsy commissionership she craved as consolation prize for her spirited but Sisyphean attempt to oust Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 1994, Ms. Castro, 55, says, ''I always like to remind people that Robert Moses didn't know how to drive, and yet he built the best parkway in the world.''</p>
        <p>Today, Ms. Castro presides over an agency with a $200 million operating budget and 1,600 full-time and 6,000 seasonal employees scattered across 158 state parks, 36 historic sites and 17 heritage areas. Most of which, during her ''old life in retail,'' she didn't realize existed.</p>
        <p>An ignorant insider no longer, she has gone outdoors and learned to rock climb, to snowshoe, to camp, to canoe. She's become a zealot for enforcing marine navigation regulations. She couldn't tell a grouse from a grackle, but inspired by the governor's hobby, she's now an amateur birder, too.</p>
        <p>''To this day,'' Ms. Castro is saying as she stomps, in sensible green gardening clogs, among the wet rhododendrons outside her office at Belmont Lake State Park, a complex Mr. Moses created after razing the Belmont mansion, ''I believe that life is 10 percent what happens to you and 90 percent how you deal with it.''</p>
        <p>TO this day, she finds it more marvelous than meddlesome that her life was forever defined by the homemade television commercial she starred in at 4. Just think, if her father the furniture pioneer, Bernard Castro, had tapped a Shirley Temple type to play the precocious sprite who yanked out that sofa bed in 1948, Bernadette Castro the furniture spokeswoman and C.E.O., the bold senatorial candidate, the zealous parks commissioner, might have been, well, wallpaper.</p>
        <p>Jackie Gleason and Milton Berle wouldn't have done skits about her. Dorothy Kilgallen wouldn't have written a column about her (''She said my father had hired a midget -- she was serious,'' Ms. Castro recalls.) Mad magazine wouldn't have done that embarrassing parody when she was in the midst of puberty. ''They gave me these huge biceps,'' she says with a theatrical wince. But that was the only downside.</p>
        <p>''If my father could have afforded Shirley Temple, I wouldn't be here today,'' she muses. An immigrant who had arrived from Sicily a penniless, non-English speaker at 15, he got into the upholstery business when a couple of Bronx neighbors complained about their ugly, balky pull-out davenports.</p>
        <p>The famous commercial ''happened by accident'' after Ms. Castro sneaked into the workroom, deployed a sofa bed and fell asleep. Her parents woke her, had her repeat her feat, and her father had his angle: ''He was a marketing genius,'' says Ms. Castro, whose reverence for her father is why she ignored the tug of politics until 1994: as long as he was alive, she couldn't sell the company.</p>
        <p>The commercial she did at 4 became the most televised in the United States; the one she did at 12 was the first live color commercial in the country, and Ms. Castro got through it even though the cue cards were upside down. ''To this day,'' she says, ''my motto is you can never be overprepared.''</p>
        <p>Her other motto is that even if she sold the business in 1993 after Bernard Castro's death in 1991, one can never stock the house with too many sofa beds. Ms. Castro, who lives with her husband, Dr. Peter Guida, and her mother, Theresa, on the five-acre former Millbrook estate in Lloyd Harbor, asserts that ''in my home there isn't a single sofa that's not a convertible.''</p>
        <p>She even keeps one in the office, nestled between a wild-eyed renovated carousel horse and Mr. Moses' massive wooden desk, ''just to remind me of my heritage.'' She jokes that it, along with as much recreational acreage as she can marshal in a tenure she hopes lasts a third Pataki term, will be her legacy.</p>
