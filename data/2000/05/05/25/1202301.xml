        <p>Four employees at a fast-food restaurant in Flushing, Queens, were shot dead and three others were injured last night during a robbery, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>Some of the employees of the restaurant, a Wendy's at 40-12 Main Street, were tied up by the robbers, and it might have taken them some time to get free before they called 911 at 12:30 a.m. today, said Lt. Corey Cuneo, a police spokesman.</p>
        <p>It was not clear whether the restaurant was open at the time of the robbery. The manager of the restaurant was among those shot, Lieutenant Cuneo said. None of the victims' names were released.</p>
        <p>The three injured people were taken to New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens. A hospital official said at 2 a.m. that their conditions were not yet known.</p>
        <p>The killings came at a time when the city's murder rate was already rising.</p>
        <p>As of May 7, the most recent date for which statistics were readily available this morning, there were 7.5 percent more homicides than at the same time last year and 18 percent more than at the same time in 1998. Then, during a 24-hour period on May 13 and 14 there were six more murders.</p>
        <p>Overall violent crime, however, was down 7.5 percent during the first three months of the year.</p>
