        <p>House Approves Trade Bill Granting China Privileges  By a surprisingly wide margin of 237 to 197, House lawmakers granted China permanent normal trading privileges after months of fierce lobbying that pitted business against organized labor.</p>
        <p>The vote virtually assures the end of the annual review of China's trade status, a ritual that Beijing considers humiliating but opponents say maintains leverage over improving human rights. The Senate is expected to endorse the measure as early as next month but may question some of the amendments the House added to the bill. [Page A1.]</p>

        <p>House Approves Trade Bill Granting China Privileges  By a surprisingly wide margin of 237 to 197, House lawmakers granted China permanent normal trading privileges after months of fierce lobbying that pitted business against organized labor.</p>
        <p>The vote virtually assures the end of the annual review of China's trade status, a ritual that Beijing considers humiliating but opponents say maintains leverage over improving human rights. The Senate is expected to endorse the measure as early as next month but may question some of the amendments the House added to the bill. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>Judge Questions Microsoft Remedy  The federal judge trying the Microsoft antitrust case raised serious questions about the government's plan to break up the company, seeming to suggest that he did not think the plan went far enough. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson rejected Microsoft's request for months of additional hearings. [A1.]</p>
        <p>While Microsoft's lawyers pleaded with the judge not to break up the company, William H. Gates and other company executives were painting a rosy picture of a software-enhanced future for chief executives of some of the world's largest companies. [C25.]</p>
        <p>Costco Shares Plummet on Warning  Costco, the warehouse club retailer, posted third-quarter results that missed Wall Street estimates and reduced its fourth-quarter outlook, leading to a $4.2 billion fall in the company's market value. Costco said its third-quarter profits rose 14 percent but fell a penny a share below expectations. Shares of Costco declined $8.75, to $31.875. [C8.]</p>
        <p>Garment Workers Lose U.S. Appeal  A federal appeals court has refused to reinstate a class-action lawsuit filed in 1997 against a garment industry union by union members who worked at a now-defunct Brooklyn sweater factory. [C2.]</p>
        <p>Cisco's Help Doesn't Come Cheap  Getting a vote of confidence from Cisco Systems can be important to fledging technology companies. For example, Selectica, a company that makes software to help businesses sell complex products over the Internet, was so eager to make Cisco its customer that in a recent deal, Selectica went beyond giving Cisco its software all the way to effectively paying Cisco to take it. Market Place. [C8.]</p>
        <p>Entertainment President at Fox  The Fox network appointed Gail Berman as president of entertainment for the network. Ms. Berman had been president of Regency Television, a production studio affiliated with Fox's television studio. She replaces Doug Herzog, who held the position only 16 months. Ms. Berman will report to Sandy Grushow, who last November was named chairman of the Fox television entertainment group. [C7.]</p>
        <p>Heineken Expands Agency's Duties  A humorous campaign in the United States for the flagship beer brewed by Heineken is increasing sales. And that has sold Heineken executives on giving the agency creating the campaign, the New York office of Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners Worldwide, an additional major assignment: to develop and produce Heineken brand advertising that is to run around the world. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C7.]</p>
        <p>Spitzer Drops Empire Opposition  Attorney General Eliot L. Spitzer of New York withdrew his opposition to plans by the big nonprofit insurer, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, to change into a for-profit company. As part of the shift, Empire would set up a multimillion-dollar foundation dedicated to making health care broadly accessible. [B5.]</p>
        <p>New Third Rail of American Politics  The expansion of temporary visas that permit foreigners to work for employers that petition on their behalf shows that immigration reform has replaced Social Security as the third rail of American politics. Washington has come to rely on the visas as a substitute for addressing the economic and social failings of current policy. Alan B. Krueger: Economic Scene. [C2.]</p>
