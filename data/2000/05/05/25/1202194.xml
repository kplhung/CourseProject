        <p>Corporate tax shelters, whose resurgence is costing the government billions of dollars a year, would be much less lucrative under revisions proposed yesterday by the bipartisan staff of the Senate Finance Committee.</p>
        <p>The proposals would require companies and the shelter designers to disclose tax-avoidance transactions more fully, subject companies that engage in shams to a 40 percent penalty on taxes they evaded and penalize the designers up to half the fees they charged for creating shams.</p>
        <p>The staff proposal is similar in many ways to regulations proposed in February by Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers to crack down on abusive tax practices by large companies. The official estimate that abusive shelters cost the government $10 billion annually, Mr. Summers said, is ''just the tip of the iceberg.'' Some estimates say it is as high as $80 billion.</p>
        <p>But the latest plan differs on key points. One difference involves whether to define tax shelters by statute or to rely on tests created under a series of rulings by tax court and other judges to determine whether a transaction was motivated by a hope for profit or was primarily a tax-avoidance technique.</p>
        <p>Senator William V. Roth Jr., the Delaware Republican who is chairman of the Finance Committee, wants written comments on the proposal by June 9, after which he will decide whether to hold hearings, said Tara Bradshaw, a committee spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>But a new law to curb corporate tax evasion is unlikely this year because Representative Bill Archer, the Texas Republican who heads the House Ways and Means Committee, has said he sees no reason to pass such legislation.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Archer has strong allies. Kenneth J. Kies of PricewaterhouseCoopers, perhaps the nation's most widely consulted expert on corporate tax-reduction techniques, says there is no need for new legislation to curb tax shelters because there is no significant problem with improper corporate tax avoidance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kies, former chief of staff for the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, said that rather than being a huge problem, abusive tax shelters are used by no more than 50 companies. He said he based this number on a report that the Treasury Department had prepared under the Paperwork Reduction Act. That report estimated that only four designers were selling tax shelters under confidentiality agreements and that 50 corporations and 50 designers were involved in the kinds of abusive practices the proposal seeks to curb.</p>
        <p>Tax specialists on Capitol Hill and in the Clinton administration said yesterday that since Mr. Summers issued the proposed regulations to curb corporate tax shelters, the use of confidentiality contracts had dried up. Instead, designers of the shelters are relying on clients to be quiet about their use of tax-shelter devices.</p>
        <p>The specialists said they were confident that far more than 50 companies used abusive shelters and that the number of 50 was a mere guess used to comply with the paperwork act's requirements.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kies's view that corporate tax shelters are a minor problem was also disputed yesterday by leaders of organizations representing tax lawyers and corporate tax executives, who say there is a significant problem of abusive corporate tax practices. Both the American Bar Association tax section and the Tax Executives Institute favor requiring fuller disclosure of tax shelters to the Internal Revenue Service.</p>
        <p>Paul Sax, chairman of the association's tax section, said, ''Many parts of this proposal are welcome.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sax said that among the provisions he liked was one requiring chief financial officers or other top executives to certify the legitimacy of transactions that create far bigger tax benefits than they do profits for a company.</p>
        <p>This proposal, similar to one made by Treasury, grew out of complaints by some corporate tax executives that they opposed illegitimate tax shelters but were overruled by chief financial officers eager to show profits.</p>
        <p>But Michael Murphy, executive director of the Tax Executives Institute, which represents corporate tax officials, said it opposed this provision.</p>
        <p>''I am not denying there have been tax directors who say their advice was ignored,'' Mr. Murphy said. ''But the clear consensus among our leadership and a sampling of our membership is that requiring the chief financial officer to attest to his knowledge of transactions is a total waste of time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphy added that increased disclosure would be meaningless unless it was accompanied by expanding the auditing staff of the I.R.S. so that the disclosures were fully investigated and improper activities were  identified and stopped.</p>
        <p>''You have a right to expect that somebody will look at those and act accordingly,'' Mr. Murphy said, adding that the institute also favors increasing the number of auditors examining individual returns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphy said he had doubts about the need for legislation, saying the Treasury and I.R.S. had sufficient authority through regulations to deal with abusive transactions.</p>
        <p>The Senate Finance Committee staff proposal deals only with companies with revenues of $10 million or more. The draft legislation would not affect wealthy individuals, though many of the most abusive tax evasions uncovered by the I.R.S. in recent years, including one marketed by PricewaterhouseCoopers, could also be used by very wealthy individuals.</p>
