        <p>Lego's popular Mindstorm line of programmable toy robots proved that it was fun to watch robots do your bidding. The latest addition to the Mindstorm line may prove that it's just as much fun to have a robot watch you.</p>
        <p>Vision Command is a $99 Web camera that, when mounted on the core unit of Lego's Robotics Invention System, can turn the toy into something resembling Robby the Robot from ''Forbidden Planet.'' Using the camera as a pair of eyes, the Mindstorm robot can detect color or movement and, depending on its programming, can react with any number of responses.</p>
        <p>The camera is tethered to the PC through a 15-foot U.S.B. cable. Programmers can break the camera's field of vision down into eight separate regions and program a different response for each one. The robot might chase a ball if it detected color in one region, snap a still photograph if it detected motion in another or utter a threat if it saw a little brother enter the room. (Threats can be easily recorded with the built-in microphone.)</p>
        <p>Simply mounted on a computer, the Vision Command can also act as a Webcam, with all the usual still and video Webcam capabilities. And, yes, it will still threaten that little brother.</p>
