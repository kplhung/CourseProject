        <p>The fourth spot in the starting rotation has been troublesome for the Mets this year. Bobby Jones struggled, then got hurt, and while his calf injury healed, his replacements earned no victories in his place.</p>
        <p>One of those replacements, Pat Mahomes, relieved Jones after five unremarkable innings tonight in San Diego. A home run by Mets second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo tied the score in the seventh inning and kept Jones from getting the loss.</p>
        <p>But the Padres' second baseman, Bret Boone, made Mahomes the loser with a bases-empty homer of his own in the eighth, the decisive shot in a 5-4 Padres victory. Boone, who drove a 3-2 pitch over the wall in left-center field leading off the inning, also hit a homer off Jones in the second.</p>
        <p>The loss was the first for Mahomes since June 1996, when he pitched for Minnesota. It snapped Mahomes's 12-game winning streak, which had been the longest in baseball.</p>
        <p>Jones, who earned a victory with six solid innings in his last start, was not as sharp this time, allowing four runs on nine hits in five innings. The Mets dropped to 3-7 in games started by their fourth starter.</p>
        <p>Jones worked out of trouble in his last three innings, leaving at least one runner in scoring position each time. But he suffered in the second, when Ryan Klesko and Boone pulled consecutive home runs to give the Padres a 3-0 lead. A single by Carlos Hernandez and a double by Ruben Rivera brought in a fourth run.</p>
        <p>The Mets, meanwhile, had difficulty sustaining rallies.</p>
        <p>Robin Ventura missed a three-run homer by a few feet in the fourth, his double hitting the wall in right-center and scoring one run. With runners at second and third and no outs, Todd Zeile bounced out, Benny Agbayani hit a run-scoring grounder and Rey Ordonez grounded out to end the threat.</p>
        <p>In the sixth, the Mets threatened again, loading the bases with one out. Manager Bobby Valentine pinch hit Matt Franco, batting .171, for Ordonez, batting .187. Brian Meadows walked Franco on four pitches to force in a run, but another pinch-hitter, Kurt Abbott (.208), bounced into a fielder's choice off Carlos Almanzar, ending the inning.</p>
