        <p>From a $13,250 Chinese rug to a $16,000 set of dining room chairs to a collection of expensive oil paintings, a parade of witnesses today described a list of lavish purchases that Albert J.

        <p>Those items, and many others, are part of the more than $1.2 million in personal expenses that federal prosecutors say Mr. Pirro, acting in concert with his brother and accountant, Anthony G. Pirro, deducted from his taxes as business write-offs between 1988 and 1997.</p>

        <p>From a $13,250 Chinese rug to a $16,000 set of dining room chairs to a collection of expensive oil paintings, a parade of witnesses today described a list of lavish purchases that Albert J. Pirro Jr. and his wife, Jeanine, the Westchester district attorney, made to decorate their home in the county.</p>
        <p>Those items, and many others, are part of the more than $1.2 million in personal expenses that federal prosecutors say Mr. Pirro, acting in concert with his brother and accountant, Anthony G. Pirro, deducted from his taxes as business write-offs between 1988 and 1997.</p>
        <p>One after another, art dealers, landscapers, a glass installer, a furniture dealer and a rug merchant testified about their goods and services -- and bills -- on the fifth day of the brothers' federal tax-fraud trial.</p>
        <p>The witnesses told of an $800 bath faucet, a $2,000 clock and a $2,500 love seat as well as an array of figurines. And there were bills for other more functional items, like $6,600 in landscaping and thousands of dollars in payments to Con Edison, all made with checks drawn on a variety of Pirro company accounts, according to the prosecutors.</p>
        <p>A Connecticut rug salesman, Javad Ahmani, testified that he took a wool-and-silk Chinese rug with a floral and animal motif to the Pirros' house, ''laid it on the floor for them to view'' and made the sale.</p>
        <p>An art dealer, Frances A. Friedman, said that Ms. Pirro commissioned a portrait of her children for $4,450 and that the invoice was faxed to and from the district attorney's office in White Plains.</p>
        <p>Ms. Pirro, who has attended much of the trial, made a brief appearance in court this afternoon. But she made just as hurried an exit about an hour later, telling reporters who asked about the fax sent from her office, ''I'm the district attorney 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,'' saying she often handled personal matters while at work, and saying that she did not tell her children, for example, not to call her at the office.</p>
        <p>The Pirro brothers have blamed each other for the accounting discrepancies but say that their situation does not constitute criminal misconduct. Albert Pirro's lawyer, Gustave H. Newman, has said that his client voluntarily turned over his records to the Internal Revenue Service and even repaid the government $150,000 more than he actually owed in back taxes and interest.</p>
        <p>As the witnesses took the stand today, some nodded or smiled at Ms. Pirro or her husband.</p>
        <p>Before she left for the day, Ms. Pirro followed one witness, Elio DiLeo, a landscaper who has worked for the Pirros for 15 years, out of the courtroom and gave him a hug.</p>
