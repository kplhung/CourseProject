        <p>With Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani out of the race for the United States Senate, leaders of the national abortion rights movement said yesterday that they had abandoned plans to remain neutral in the New York contest and would endorse Hillary Rodham Clinton over her new opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio. Mrs. Clinton said she now intended to make abortion rights a central issue of her candidacy.</p>
        <p>The endorsement, by the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League, suggests the extent to which the political ground has shifted with Mr. Giuliani's exit from the race.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's strong support among abortion rights advocates had been one of the obstacles Mrs. Clinton faced in mounting a campaign against the moderate Republican mayor. Mr. Giuliani and Mrs. Clinton hold essentially identical positions on abortion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio has described himself as ''pro-choice,'' and his aides noted yesterday that throughout his years in Congress he steadfastly opposed laws that would outlaw abortion. In interviews over the weekend, however, Mr. Lazio also voiced his opposition to public financing of abortion, and to the kind of abortion procedure that critics refer to as ''partial birth abortion,'' in both cases drawing a contrast with Mrs. Clinton's views on the subject, which he described as extreme.</p>
        <p>He also supports laws requiring that the parents of teenagers be notified when their daughters are seeking abortions.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Giuliani was the Republican candidate, Mrs. Clinton's advisers had expressed concern about the extent to which she would be able to campaign on the issue of abortion, a subject that has proved to be highly effective for Democrats running statewide in New York.</p>
        <p>But in an interview yesterday, Mrs. Clinton pointed to the abortion league endorsement, which is to be announced at a news conference in Manhattan this morning, as evidence that there were clear differences between the two candidates, and she said she would raise them repeatedly in the months ahead.</p>
        <p>''Abortion rights will be an important issue in this race,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''As the Naral endorsement makes clear, New Yorkers will have a clear choice, and New Yorkers will always be able to count on me to protect a women's right to choose in the Senate.''</p>
        <p>Signaling a theme that she intends to use in the months ahead, Mrs. Clinton asserted that Roe v. Wade, the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion, may be in jeopardy in the coming years, depending on the makeup of the Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>''The estimates are that the next Senate is going to confirm three or four justices,'' Mrs. Clinton said, adding, ''I will not vote to confirm judges who do not believe that Roe v. Wade should be upheld.''</p>
        <p>The questions of Mr. Lazio's view on abortion, as well as his positions on a number of issues, may prove to be a matter of definition, and both candidates were moving aggressively yesterday to be the first to do the defining, drawing on contrasting interpretations of eight years of Congressional votes cast by Mr. Lazio, a Republican from Suffolk County.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton sought to portray Mr. Lazio as an abortion foe, setting up a news conference in which she would receive the endorsement of both the national and New York chapter of abortion rights league. Officials with the two organizations provided a detailed list of votes Mr. Lazio had cast to try to show that he has ''an abysmal record'' on abortion, in the words of Kelli Conlin, the executive director of the New York affiliate of the league.</p>
        <p>But Dan McLagan, Mr. Lazio's spokesman, asserted last night that Mr. Lazio was a supporter of abortion rights, and more precisely represented the views of a majority of New Yorkers on the subject.</p>
        <p>''Rich Lazio's pro-choice,'' Mr. McLagan said. ''But he opposes taxpayer-subsidized abortion, supports parental notification and opposes the heinous practice of partial-birth abortion. Those are the abortion issues in this campaign. And that is the mainstream New York position. Mrs. Clinton is obviously staking out an extreme position.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McLagan said that Mr. Lazio would not cast votes on nominees for the Supreme Court based solely on abortion or any other issue. ''Congressman Lazio opposes litmus tests of any kind,'' Mr. McLagan said. ''Judges should be based on their qualifications to be Supreme Court justices.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's attempt to portray Mr. Lazio as an abortion foe were rebutted yesterday by an unlikely source: the leader of the Right to Life Party in New York, Ken Diem. He said his party was finding its own candidate to run in the race, and described Mr. Lazio as ''totally unacceptable.''</p>
        <p>''He's a very proud pro-choice Catholic, which makes him totally unacceptable,'' Mr. Diem said.</p>
        <p>Leaders of the abortion rights league yesterday strongly disputed Mr. Lazio's portrayal of his abortion views. ''Lazio can try to define himself any way he pleases,'' said Kate Michelman, the league's national president. ''But he has a record. He's not pro-choice. He would like to portray himself pro-choice to New Yorkers, his record is anything but.''</p>
