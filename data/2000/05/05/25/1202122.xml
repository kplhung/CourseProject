        <p>I HAVE been told that in some families a hammock can last for years.

        <p>I HAVE been told that in some families a hammock can last for years. I am more familiar with the sort of situation in which eight small and medium-size children who are pretending to be pirates routinely pile onto a hammock, rock it vigorously to simulate high seas and dangle 16 legs through the mesh to taunt imaginary sharks.</p>
        <p>One cannot really expect miracles from a natural cotton rope structure supported by two spreader bars and zinc-plated hanging hardware. Even the sturdy old oaks that suspend the ''ship'' are in peril.</p>
        <p>So almost every year, I buy a new hammock, and it's always the same model (since there's nothing wrong with the product that pirate-proofing wouldn't fix): the ''original Pawleys Island rope hammock,'' made in North Carolina and distributed nationwide. According to the manufacturer's Web site, Pawleys.com, it comes in three sizes. I buy the middle size, which can hold two adults or 450 pounds or as many as eight bloodthirsty buccaneers.</p>
        <p>The last hammock, if I recall correctly, came from a mail-order catalog. I paid about $100 for it, plus shipping, which set me back an additional $10 or so.</p>
        <p>''Plus shipping.'' In the months since buying the hammock, I have come to realize that ''plus shipping'' is one of the ugliest phrases in the English language. Thanks to the multitude of online retailers who offered free shipping during last winter's holiday shopping season, I have been conditioned to believe that I am entitled to this perk forever.</p>
        <p>A lot of online shoppers share my expectations, it turns out. Last week, Forrester Research reported that 94 percent of online shoppers were concerned about shipping costs and that 44 percent had abandoned an online shopping cart after they found out how much the shipping costs would add to the total. These are, mind you, the same shoppers who for years accepted mail-order catalogs' shipping charges, which often add up to 15 percent to the cost of a purchase.</p>
        <p>''Consumers have different expectations when they shop online, not only because the retail sites raised their expectations during the Christmas season, but also because shoppers see that they are giving the sites something in return, information about themselves,'' said Susy Chan, director of the e-commerce technology program at DePaul University in Chicago.</p>
        <p>Now that she mentioned it, I did resent typing in all kinds of valuable personal information -- name, address, phone number, name of street where I grew up in case I forgot my password and needed a prompt every time I bought something online. Beyond the privacy concerns, these questions are annoyingly time-consuming. I should be compensated.</p>
        <p>So last week, I started my search for a hammock at a site called freeshipping.com (www.freeshipping  .com), which has a search engine to point shoppers toward about a million products that the site's 125 retail partners are willing to sell without charging shipping and handling fees. Freeshipping.com's partners -- who include both well-known retailers like Cooking.com and smaller specialty retailers like Kideo.com, which sells personalized children's videos -- pay freeshipping.com a commission for sales referrals.</p>
        <p>Freeshipping.com's founder, D. J. Vallauri, got the idea for creating the site after starting another Web site called Mustardstore.com (which he eventually sold). ''I kept getting feedback from people who wanted to order a bottle of mustard that cost a few dollars and were complaining that the shipping cost a fortune,'' Mr. Vallauri said. ''They were right.''</p>
        <p>The selection at freeshipping.com -- 10 categories, including apparel and office supplies -- is more quirky than comprehensive. ''I just want people to think of this site as a first stop when they shop to see if someone is willing to sell whatever you want to buy without charging you for shipping,'' Mr. Vallauri said.</p>
        <p>After I did a search for ''hammock'' on the home page, the site returned matches in three product categories. Although the search results were displayed in a confusing way -- many matches, were redundant, for instance -- I quickly found the model I wanted, at Ezshop.com for $95.70.</p>
        <p>When I clicked on Buy Now, freeshipping.com sent me directly to Ezshop.com's Web site. But after I arrived, I hesitated because Ezshop.com said the item ''usually ships within 14 business days.'' That seemed like a long time. More important, I was shopping in an unfamiliar store. The home page said Ezshop.com was located in Dallas, and it listed a phone number -- unfortunately not toll-free -- that I could call for customer service. When I phoned anyway, no one answered.</p>
        <p>That made me uneasy. So I did some quick comparison shopping. Using search engines, I found the same model at higher prices and with shipping costs that ranged from $8.95 to $14.95 at several other online shops. One, Smith &amp; Hawken (www.smithandhawken.com), was a store I know well. But there I would have to pay nearly 40 percent more; even on sale, the hammock would cost $133.95, including shipping and handling. On the other hand, the Smith &amp; Hawken hammock would arrive much sooner: in 7 to 10 business days.</p>
        <p>Was it worth it to pay extra for security? In this sort of situation, many experienced online shoppers will choose the brand name they trust, said Ms. Chan, of DePaul University. ''Convenience, the time spent and knowing that the item will arrive when it is expected are more important than just getting a short-term benefit like free shipping,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But brand names do not mean that much to me, not when the items offered by two retailers are identical. The only perk that I can think of that is more valuable than saving money would be something along the lines of guaranteed baby-sitting on a Saturday night. Any online retailer who offered that would earn my loyalty. Friday night would be good, too.</p>
        <p>In the absence of such luxuries, I sent e-mail to ask Ezshop why shipping took so long and why the phone wasn't answered. Within two hours, Ezshop responded: ''We seem to have had some trouble with our phones earlier today. They are now working and we would be happy to help you via phone. In regards to shipping, all items ship directly from the manufacturer, and this particular manufacturer needs this long to ship orders. Although they tend to ship much faster, normally in five business days.''</p>
        <p>I ordered the hammock from Ezshop. I hope it arrives when it's supposed to. Or else, I have been told, I may walk the plank.</p>
