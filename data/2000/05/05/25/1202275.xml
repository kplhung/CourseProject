        <p>Fred Benjamin Dance Company</p>
        <p>Symphony Space</p>
        <p>The Fred Benjamin Dance Company leaped through almost three decades of choreography by Mr. Benjamin on Sunday night. The program, to recorded musical collages, featured ''The New Warriors,'' a revised version of a piece dating from 1991. Its bounding groups were obviously crusading for joy. Everyone's exhilaration was refreshing, although a few more sequences suggesting quiet pleasure might have made the rousing episodes even more astonishing.</p>
        <p>''Beattyville'' honored Talley Beatty, one of America's modern-dance pioneers, and Mr. Benjamin's choreography featured the restless movements for which Beatty was noted. But whereas Beatty often devised such steps to evoke urban tensions, Mr. Benjamin used them for their inherent kinetic excitement.</p>

        <p>The Fred Benjamin Dance Company leaped through almost three decades of choreography by Mr. Benjamin on Sunday night. The program, to recorded musical collages, featured ''The New Warriors,'' a revised version of a piece dating from 1991. Its bounding groups were obviously crusading for joy. Everyone's exhilaration was refreshing, although a few more sequences suggesting quiet pleasure might have made the rousing episodes even more astonishing.</p>
        <p>''Beattyville'' honored Talley Beatty, one of America's modern-dance pioneers, and Mr. Benjamin's choreography featured the restless movements for which Beatty was noted. But whereas Beatty often devised such steps to evoke urban tensions, Mr. Benjamin used them for their inherent kinetic excitement.</p>
        <p>''Bits and Pieces of Times Remembered'' was a suite of excerpts from dances of the 70's and 80's. Some were puzzling out of context. Yet Terrence Poplar commanded attention in a prowling solo from ''Prey'' and Tetsuo Yoshida became a strange nonhuman creature Tyrone Monroe tried to control in a duet from ''Ceremony.'' The suite also included the only choreography not by Mr. Benjamin: a dance of mounting fervor that Winston DeWitt Hemsley, the troupe's former co-artistic adviser, created for ''Ember'' in 1971.</p>
        <p>Two fine guest dancers made appearances. Christopher Huggins rose from the floor in a sinuous twisting fashion in a scene from ''Illuminations.'' The tense pulled-in gestures of Marilyn Banks convincingly made her a frustrated woman ready to burst in a solo from ''Echoes of an Era.''</p>
        <p>The program was produced by Dr. Glory Van Scott, who greeted the audience in a brief welcoming speech.</p>
