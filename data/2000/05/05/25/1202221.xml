        <p>Over the last 20 years, Robert L. Johnson has used Black Entertainment Television to build a financial empire, employing skill, ruthlessness and a knack for niche marketing. With his plan to run a spin-off from the merger between United Airlines and US Airways, the challenge for Mr. Johnson is whether those same abilities will work in a different kind of business, the mature and cutthroat airline industry.</p>
        <p>There is no hard-and-fast requirement that it takes an airline background to run an air carrier, even a start-up, people in the industry said today. And much of what a chief executive needs in that business is marketing.</p>
        <p>''We're not in the silk-scarf-and-goggles era,'' said George Hamlin, an aviation consultant here. ''This is no longer a business where technicians are paramount.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hamlin and others said that Mr. Johnson's new entry, DC Air, will need to create a distinct identity through innovative marketing and cut costs if it hopes to be a success.</p>
        <p>The deal had its origin six weeks ago at a breakfast Mr. Johnson had at Washington's Four Seasons Hotel with Stephen M. Wolf, chairman of the US Airways Group. According to Mr. Johnson, Mr. Wolf informed him that he was contemplating a deal with the UAL Corporation, the parent of United Airlines, and would have to shed some ''assets'' at Ronald Reagan National Airport.</p>
        <p>''He asked me if I was interested,'' said Mr. Johnson, who has been a member of the US Airways board for four years. ''He thought it would be a great opportunity for me.''</p>
        <p>But while Mr. Johnson has shown himself to be a shrewd marketer with an ability to keep both production and labor costs down, his experience has been marketing to a largely black audience.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson -- who took an idea he heard about creating a cable channel that would appeal to an elderly audience and adapted it for black viewers -- used to tell friends: ''You don't have to reinvent the wheel. You've just got to paint it black.''</p>
        <p>In a telephone news conference, Mr. Johnson, who was stuck on the runway at La Guardia Airport in New York, on his private jet, said  that he believed he could make the new airline a success. ''I feel very comfortable about doing this, because at the end of the day, it doesn't matter what your race or ethnicity is,'' he said. ''People want the same thing. They want good service. They want good value.''</p>
        <p>Fresh thinking is a plus, say old hands in the airline business. ''Showing yourself to be a demonstrated, capable leader with out-of-the-box thinking is an imperative in the airline industry,'' said Kenneth Quinn, an aviation lawyer and former Federal Aviation Administration official. ''If you have close contact with consumers, that's going to be the key to your success. The fact that Mr. Johnson has driven a customer-, consumer-oriented business to large success can be quite helpful.''</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Mr. Quinn said, airlines are a notoriously tough business where profits are often hard to come by. And US Airways' operations are the most costly in the industry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson has something else to take on in the airline business, too -- its unions. Airlines are one of the most heavily unionized industries in the country, and Mr. Johnson has had severe run-ins with his unionized work force at BET.</p>
        <p>In 1993, Mr. Johnson and BET management laid off or cut the hours of 14 supporters of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, which had recently won the right to represent technicians at the cable operation. A judge later ordered them reinstated.</p>
        <p>Union officials also said BET's management was rigid during negotiations for a new contract for the technicians, who earn significantly less than their counterparts at other television stations. ''There wasn't any bargaining,'' said Lillian Firmani, business manager for Local 1200 of the I.B.E.W.</p>
        <p>Beyond those potential problems, there are other challenges to making the proposed spinoff, which would fly  in and out of the airport closest to downtown Washington, a successful operation.</p>
        <p>DC Air would be mostly in the short-haul market, the most brutally competitive part of the airline business, and be a spinoff from a barely profitable airline, in a business where it is the bigger networks that are prospering. That, of course, is the main reason that United and US Airways are getting together in the first place, and proposing to hand off everything but the US Airways shuttle at Reagan National Airport.</p>
        <p>The proposed DC Air would begin as a ''virtual airline,'' leasing 10 Boeing 737's, complete with pilots and flight attendants, and buying from United the time of mechanics, gate agents and everything else needed for a flight, almost down to the foil-wrapped peanuts. Most airlines lease some planes, the way consumers lease cars. But ''wet leasing,'' which is what DC Air would do, is akin to hiring a chauffeured car.</p>
        <p>It plans to buy 8 turboprops and 19 regional jets from the merged airline, and use US Airways and United employees, at least to get started.</p>
        <p>''The same routes, the same airplanes, the same people, just with a different owner -- it doesn't seem like a formula for success,'' said S. Mark Ray, an analyst at John Hancock. ''There's got to be more to it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson today gave a hint of what the something more would be. He spoke of tie-ins with rental car and hotel companies, and offering low fares. ''I think I'm going to bring to this airline some of the same marketing strategy that Richard Branson brings to Virgin.''</p>
        <p>But it will not be easy. The new airline will fly from National Airport, one of the few major airports that absolutely cannot function as a hub,  at a time when most in the industry think that hubs are the easiest route to success. A hub operation requires the ability to land and launch large numbers of planes almost simultaneously; National Airport, with a single runway for big jets, can handle only a modest stream.</p>
        <p>But access to the airport itself is a major plus. ''Having access to a major market is the only way a new carrier can effectively compete,'' said T. Allan McArtor, who led the F.A.A. from 1987 to 1989 and is now heading a start-up, Legend Airlines, in Dallas, after a long legal battle to get access to its similarly close-in airport, Love Field. He agreed with other experts that an airline background was no longer essential for the chief executive. ''You need airline experience, but you don't have to have it individually, if you're a good leader and manager and motivator.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson certainly has a reputation for making things work and for making friends in the right places. He began BET with an investment of $15,000, but was able to raise $10 million for his fledgling company by selling stakes to communications giants like Time Inc. and Taft Broadcasting. Over the years he has expanded into restaurants, night clubs, magazines and an interactive Web site called BET.com. The privately-held parent company, BET Holdings Inc., is now worth an estimated $2 billion.</p>
        <p>''Bob is a relentless and passionate entrepreneur who is very smart,'' said Peter Barton, the former head of mergers and acquisitions for TCI, the giant cable company that began carrying BET on its cable systems in the early 1980's.</p>
        <p>He also has been politically well connected. He has been a major fund-raiser for President Clinton and the Democratic Party and was a close friend of Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown. This week he attended a White House dinner for the president of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki.</p>
        <p>Over the years Mr. Johnson has drawn his share of criticism from those who say BET provides a rather low-brow mix of entertainment, mainly music videos. He has been often satirized in the black syndicated comic strip ''Boondocks'' for not providing more uplifting and relevant programming for his black audience.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson said today that the parties would have 90 days to complete the negotiations for the transfer of slots at Reagan Airport, leases and other considerations from US Airways to DC Air. He declined to say how much the final price would be, but declared that he was not looking for outside investors.</p>
        <p>There is some doubt, though, whether the merger and the spinoff will pass muster with the federal government. Certainly it has opponents, among them other airlines, like Mr. McArtor's, that would like to divide up the slots at National among themselves. Some consumer advocates agree.</p>
        <p>David S. Stempler, president of the Air Travelers Association, which lobbies for consumers and offers discounts and safety analyses of airlines, said that ensuring competition might be better achieved by strengthening existing carriers at National Airport rather than setting up a new airline. The slots are public assets, he said, like television broadcast licenses, and should be distributed through a government-led process at which consumer advocates and other companies could be heard.</p>
        <p>United, he said, was being ''politically correct'' by setting up a black-owned company, which, he said, might fail as Air Atlanta, another airline managed by a black chief executive, did in 1987. Airlines, he said, might represent ''an equal opportunity failure mode.''</p>
