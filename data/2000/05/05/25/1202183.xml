        <p>While Microsoft's lawyers pleaded with a federal judge not to break up the company, William H. Gates and other senior company executives were painting a rosy picture of a software-enhanced future today for chief executives of some of the world's largest companies.</p>
        <p>The focus of the annual event on Microsoft's campus here was the Internet's impact on business and, to a lesser extent, consumers. In the limited portion of the gathering open to the media, the courtroom battle over Microsoft's survival was not even mentioned.</p>
        <p>The guest list included notable Friends of Bill like Warren E. Buffett; major customers like Michael Dell of Dell Computer and Michael D. Capellas of Compaq Computer; fellow software vendors like Carol Bartz of Autodesk Inc.; international luminaries like Sir Richard Branson, founder of the Virgin Group; and cultural icons like Martha Stewart.</p>
        <p>In all, there were 142 executives from 28 countries and 35 business sectors, according to Microsoft. Mr. Gates called the gathering a ''learning event'' for the company as it tries to sort out what kind of Internet-related software is a priority for business.</p>
        <p>The guests declined to say whether Microsoft's plight was discouraging open discussion of the impact of antitrust law on technology development.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Capellas, in a brief session with reporters, said that collaboration and standards allowing people to exchange information in a variety of formats were essential to the Internet's development. He added, as Mr. Gates betrayed no emotion, ''Anything that gets in the way of allowing us to build complete solutions is a problem.''</p>
        <p>Although Microsoft seemed intent on treating uncertainty about its corporate future as taboo, its efforts to develop products for the future it foresees and its own use of them were prominently featured. Ever the salesman, Mr. Gates, Microsoft's chairman, delivered an opening address peppered with phrases like ''the magic of software.''</p>
        <p>Every chief executive received a new Pocket PC, the hand-held computer from Hewlett-Packard,  equipped with Microsoft software for reading electronic books and other Web-based functions.</p>
        <p>The computers -- personal digital assistants in the industry's jargon -- included pictures and biographies of all those attending to encourage the social mixing and informal discussion that is typically the main attraction for such exclusive business gatherings. The discussions closed to the media covered evergreen subjects like Strategies for the Age of Speed: Reinvention as an Ongoing Task as well as pressing concerns like Internet Valuations: How High? How Long? How Painful?</p>
        <p>Those whose attention drifted could listen to classical music or read books that had been loaded onto the devices, including Michael Crichton's new novel, ''Timeline.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates's remarks centered on the thesis that the Internet age was entering a third stage. The first, which he identified as running from 1995 to 1998, was characterized by corporate Web sites that provided data for people to read and measured how many visitors were received. The second stage, still around in most areas, he said, features a ''mania for getting transactions onto the Web'' in which gross sales are ''worshiped'' with little attention to how much they cost.</p>
        <p>The stage now beginning, he said, will focus on Internet activities that contribute to profitability and make better use of ''knowledge workers.'' Such workers will receive information personalized to their needs from many sites on a variety of devices that allow them to write and annotate through speech recognition, as well as simply read, and the information will be used to actually do business online.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gates also did his best to entertain his guests. A video called ''Everyone's Talking Technology'' featured, among other scenes, a court battle before Judge Judy in which Mr. Buffett accused Mr. Gates of deliberately disconnecting his computer rather than play out an online hand of bridge in which he was about to lose a $2 bet to Mr. Buffett. Judge Judy ordered Mr. Gates to pay up, expressing the belief that Mr. Buffett might be able to make a useful investment.</p>
        <p>The event began Tuesday evening with a cocktail reception at the Four Seasons Olympic Hotel in downtown Seattle and continued tonight with the social highlight: a boat cruise and visit to Mr. Gates's futuristic house on the shores of Lake Washington.</p>
