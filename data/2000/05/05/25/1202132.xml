        <p>USING the Internet to apply to college has become a popular option among high school seniors over the past few years. But online applications have always been just that -- an option.</p>
        <p>If students wanted to rely on typewriters or their own handwriting, they could fill out paper forms.</p>
        <p>Now at least one undergraduate institution is doing away with paper applications. Starting this fall, West Virginia Wesleyan College will be requiring applicants to fill out and send in their forms online.</p>
        <p>A few graduate schools have the same requirement, but according to Embark.com, the company that is providing the online service, West Virginia Wesleyan is the first college to make online applications mandatory for undergraduates.</p>
        <p>Most colleges have shunned such a requirement because they do not want to exclude students who do not have easy access to the Internet.</p>
        <p>''Everybody may not have equal access to this technology,'' said Joyce Smith, director of the National Association for College Admission Counseling. ''There may be some students who are disadvantaged by the requirement.''</p>
        <p>But officials at West Virginia Wesleyan, a private liberal arts college of 1,500 students in Buckhannon, W.Va., said they were confident that the requirement would not be a limitation. The university receives about 1,600 applications a year.</p>
        <p>The requirement, university officials said, is part of the college's push to be technologically advanced.</p>
        <p>In addition, the college provides laptop computers to every new student and plans to provide wireless Internet access on campus this fall.</p>
        <p>Dr. William R. Haden, the college's president, said that admissions counselors who visit high schools would make their laptop computers available to students who wanted to fill out applications and that alumni might be able to provide computer access. He expected that computers in churches, public libraries and high schools would also be available.</p>
        <p>''This gives us the comfort that we can have this requirement and not have it be a barrier to access,'' Dr. Haden said.</p>
        <p>The college does not require essays, and officials expect that most students will be able to fill out the applications in less than half an hour. Most of the supplementary material included with admissions applications, like high school transcripts and teacher recommendations, will still be completed on paper and sent through the mail, Dr. Haden said.</p>
        <p>The college has already been criticized by some advocates for people with disabilities. Some say that online applications have not been built to work with screen-reading software for the blind and that they cannot be easily filled out by people who are unable to operate a mouse.</p>
        <p>In response, Dr. Haden said that the college would find alternatives for students who could not fill out the online applications because of disabilities.</p>
        <p>''We will work to find solutions to such a situation,'' he said.</p>
