        <p>A brief amendment to the copyright law has pitted musicians against recording companies over the question of who owns recordings: the companies that finance and market them or the musicians who perform them.</p>
        <p>At stake is control over recordings beginning 35 years after they were first released, when many of them are still extremely valuable. The debate is highly technical, but it has inflamed passions and turned musicians into political organizers.</p>
        <p>The musicians want the copyright law changed to designate them the legal authors of their recordings. With this designation they would be able to reclaim the rights they often granted to recording companies when they were young and inexperienced and take control of assets that have generated billions of dollars for those companies. They could sell the rights to new bidders or exploit them themselves.</p>
        <p>But if the recording companies are held to be the authors -- as they are under the amendment that was enacted last year -- they will retain those rights for the full length of the copyright, 95 years.</p>
        <p>The amendment, which was advocated by recording companies, was inserted without debate into an unrelated bill in Congress last November. It has spurred protests by musicians and organizations like the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, which presents the Grammy Awards; the American Federation of Musicians; the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, which represents vocalists; and AmSong, a songwriters' organization. A House of Representatives subcommittee is to hold hearings on the issue for today.</p>
        <p>The four-line amendment explicitly added sound recordings as a category of copyrighted materials that can be considered ''work made for hire'' under the 1976 Federal Copyright Act. To come under this category, the work would have to be defined that way in musicians' contracts with recording companies.</p>
        <p>Although such language often has been included in contracts -- usually in cases when fledgling musicians have little bargaining power -- many musicians and their lawyers have questioned whether the work-for-hire provisions were ever valid under the copyright law. The amendment ends those questions.</p>
        <p>Works for hire are collective works, like movies or atlases, that are commissioned by studios or publishers as employers; the employers have the rights of authors for copyright purposes. Most recordings are also collaborations; they involve producers, engineers, packagers and backup musicians as well as the performer whose name is on the cover.</p>
        <p>Recording companies had written into typical contracts that sound recordings are works for hire, commissioned by the company or made by performers and technicians hired as employees. Otherwise, they say, contributors to a recording might claim joint authorship and create chaos when the copyright reverts to its listed authors in 35 years.</p>
        <p>For contracts dated after Jan. 1, 1978, the copyright act promised authors a second chance by allowing them to reclaim their copyrights after 35 years by exercising what the law calls a termination right.</p>
        <p>''Before the new law,'' Marybeth Peters, the Register of Copyrights at the United States Copyright Office, told the industry publication Billboard recently, ''artists absolutely had the right to reclaim them.'' Ms. Peters said that with the change in law, ''U.S. recording artists are the most unprotected segment of the entire world of copyright.''</p>
        <p>But the recording companies' trade group, the Recording Industry Association of America, contends that the amendment is simply a clarification of the 1976 copyright bill, which, they say, covered recordings under the wording ''collective works'' and ''compilations.''</p>
        <p>Jon Baumgarten, who helped draft the 1976 law, served as general counsel for the Copyright Office and has represented the industry association on other matters, said: ''This is not a major change in the way things have been since 1976. The typical sound recording, an album, fits precisely the category of collective work, and if the artist signs a contract acknowledging that it should be treated as a work for hire, that's the end of it.''</p>
        <p>Paul Goldstein, a professor at Stanford Law School and the author of ''Copyright,'' a basic legal text (Aspen Law and Business), supported this view. ''I don't know that the second chance was there to begin with, given the way Congress designed this,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But many musicians and their lawyers disagree. ''This is a seismic shift in the copyright law,'' said Michael Greene, president of the academy of recording arts and sciences. ''You don't do this in the dead of night without participation from the people who are writing the songs.''</p>
        <p>Many musicians' lawyers had assumed that because sound recordings were not specifically named as a category of works for hire, performers still retained the rights of authorship even if they signed contracts that said otherwise. In the event of a dispute, they expected that a court would resolve the matter.</p>
        <p>Under the new amendment, if a musician has agreed to work-for-hire status in a contract, the recording company becomes the author. The author of, for example, the next Sheryl Crow album would be not Ms. Crow but Interscope Records. Ms. Crow is scheduled to testify at today's hearing before the Judiciary Committee's Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property.</p>
        <p>The rise of the Internet has made the music business even more litigious than usual. In battles with online music companies, the industry association has presented itself as an advocate for musicians. But the copyright change points to where the interests of companies and musicians diverge.</p>
        <p>''The public needs to understand that the R.I.A.A. does not and never has represented recording artists,'' said the songwriter and musician Don Henley, referring to the recording industry association. He is a founder of the Artists' Coalition, a musicians' trade group galvanized by the copyright change.</p>
        <p>The amendment was placed in the unrelated Satellite Home Viewer Improvement Act in response to an industry request by a staff lawyer for the House subcommittee. It was attached to an omnibus spending bill that was passed last November.</p>
        <p>Hilary Rosen, president of the recording industry association, conceded that the way that the change was adopted had angered musicians.  ''I am no longer willing to defend the process,'' she said. ''The issue is about where we go from here on the substance. People in the record industry have always believed that sound recordings were eligible as works for hire. That's why this amendment did not seem outrageous to them. It's not about stealing authorship.''</p>
        <p>Under the 1976 copyright law, rights to recordings would begin to revert in 2013. It is hard to predict how broadly the recording companies would be affected.</p>
        <p>A 1994 article for ''Entertainment, Publishing and the Arts Handbook'' (West Group) by Randy S. Frisch and Matthew J. Fortnow called the situation a ''time bomb'' for recording companies. It pointed out that for the labels, sales of older recordings are more profitable than sales of new releases since costs have been recouped and older contracts have lower royalty rates.</p>
        <p>The amendment sets out to defuse the time bomb. If the recordings are works for hire, author's rights would continue to belong to the recording company for the full term of the copyright: 95 years for a work for hire or 70 years after the author's death. Depending on whether the amendment is considered a technical or substantive change -- a matter still undecided -- it will either cover recordings made after 1978 or since its passage last year.</p>
        <p>Ms. Crow said that her contract called her recordings works for hire. But she does not consider herself an employee commissioned by the recording company. ''As an artist,'' she said, ''I author the material, I hire my musicians, I book the studio time, I hire my engineer, I compose the work, I hand it in.''</p>
        <p>Representative Howard Coble, Republican of North Carolina and  chairman of the Subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property, who scheduled today's hearings, said that all of the conference members -- Democrat and Republican -- had approved the amendment and that the process had not been unusual.</p>
        <p>''Initially, it was my belief that opponents of the work-for-hire language were overreacting,'' Mr. Coble said. ''I may be wrong; maybe they're not overreacting. I'd like to hear from both sides.''</p>
        <p>Jake Seiwert, a White House press spokesman, said that while the Clinton administration was aware of the issue, it had not yet taken a position.</p>
        <p>Musicians hope to see the provision repealed after the hearings. ''I'm sympathetic with everybody who's unhappy with this,'' Ms. Rosen of the industry association said. ''I'm looking for a way out, but I'm not sure what that is right now. It would be nice to find a way not to have people feel so cheated.''</p>
