        <p>A HUMOROUS campaign in the United States for the flagship beer brewed by Heineken N.V. is increasing sales. And that has sold Heineken executives on giving the agency creating the campaign an additional major assignment: to develop and produce Heineken brand advertising that is to run around the world.</p>
        <p>Heineken is significantly expanding its relationship with the New York office of Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners Worldwide, which since April 1998 has created ads for Heineken USA. The worldwide assignment is a new one; typically, Heineken campaigns are produced by local agencies that vary country by country.</p>
        <p>The awarding of the new duties to Lowe Lintas New York points to intensified efforts by giant marketers to improve the creative content of their campaigns. Heineken joins advertisers like Coca-Cola, Kellogg, McDonald's and Procter &amp; Gamble.</p>
        <p>''We've got to raise the bar on creative,'' Frazer Thompson, global brand director at Heineken in Amsterdam, said in a telephone interview. ''So the first place you turn is to the people who are doing it well.</p>
        <p>''There's a creative ethos at Lowe you don't find at many agencies,'' he added. ''It can be a challenging environment, shall we say, but that's good for a marketeer.''</p>
        <p>Executives at Heineken's headquarters intend to strongly ''encourage local markets to use'' the Lowe Lintas New York ads, Mr. Thompson said, or they can continue running campaigns from local agencies -- but only ''if the creative is better.''</p>
        <p>''This should be seen as a challenge to the local agencies,'' he added. ''Any work they're creating, we'll benchmark against the global pool.''</p>
        <p>Agencies working for Heineken locally include offices of Bates Worldwide; J. Walter Thompson, part of the WPP Group; and Lowe Howard-Spink in London, which like Lowe Lintas New York is part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>
        <p>In addition, the Singapore office of Bates, part of the Cordiant Communications Group, is being named to handle additional creative responsibilities for the Heineken brand in Asia. The brand has a somewhat different image in that part of the world, Mr. Thompson said, where it is typically sold at higher prices than in Europe and North America.</p>
        <p>The United States campaign for Heineken, carrying the theme ''It's all about the beer,'' presents light-hearted vignettes known as ''beer moments'' in the lives of drinkers, particularly men ages 21 to 24. The ads are different from many in the beer category, which is replete with pitches featuring broad humor and scantily clad ''babes.''</p>
        <p>For instance, in one television commercial, a seemingly nice guy is revealed to be a ''weasel'': he brings Brand X beer to a party but drinks someone else's Heineken. In another spot, titled ''The mood swing,'' a sports fan's elation turns to gloom when a gesturing friend knocks over his cup of Heineken.</p>
        <p>In a third commercial, ''The premature pour,'' an eager swain demonstrates poor technique in failing to properly transfer the contents of a bottle of Heineken to his glass. Another spot, ''The male bonding incident,'' depicts an awkward moment between two buddies when one hands the other a Heineken and their fingers accidentally touch. Those two spots were shown last week at the Interpublic annual meeting as part of a reel of commercials deemed to be particularly creative.</p>
        <p>In the American market, ''people were saying 'Heineken's a great beer,' but they weren't saying 'Heineken's a great beer for me,' '' Mr. Thompson said. ''We wanted Heineken to be more relevant, to be seen as a beer that makes any occasion special rather than a beer for special occasions.''</p>
        <p>Lowe Lintas' New York campaign, he added, ''has really made a significant difference in the last year.''</p>
        <p>''The bottom line is, we're selling more beer than we used to, and the brand equity measures are moving in the right direction.''</p>
        <p>Though Corona now outsells Heineken among Americans drinking imported beers, Heineken is growing about 8 percent annually, far exceeding the growth rate for the total United States beer market.</p>
        <p>Lowe Lintas New York is completing almost a dozen TV commercials for worldwide use that carry the theme ''It has to be Heineken.'' The approach is similar to the United States ads as Heineken executives look ''for the cultural similarities,'' Mr. Thompson said, ''instead of the cultural differences.''</p>
        <p>The new spots, still in production, include ''The torment,'' in which a sports fan waiting in line for a Heineken is unnerved as the crowd roars in response to plays he cannot see; ''The pain barrier,'' in which drinkers fish inside a tub filled with icy water to retrieve bottles of Heineken; and ''The stalemate,'' a series of commercials about two men fighting for the last bottle of Heineken in a refrigerator.</p>
        <p>''This first presented itself to us around three or four months ago,'' said Michael Silver, a managing director at Lowe Lintas who is also executive vice president and worldwide account director on Heineken, ''when a dialogue started about focusing on 'beer moments' for a global audience rather than just a U.S. audience.''</p>
        <p>''This is a tremendous win for the agency,'' he added, ''and a huge opportunity.''</p>
        <p>The timing of the assignment is fortunate because it comes only months after the merger that created Lowe Lintas, in which Interpublic combined the Lowe &amp; Partners unit of Lowe with Ammirati Puris Lintas. There are perceptions along Madison Avenue that the merger is taking a long time to jell, and the defections of some employees and clients are feeding those perceptions.</p>
        <p>''I think we've come a long way as an agency in a short time,'' said Lee Garfinkel, chairman and chief creative officer for the United States operations of Lowe Lintas.</p>
        <p>''I still expect we'll have some bumps along the way,'' he added, ''but it's a good start.''</p>
        <p>Heineken spends about $40 million annually on American advertising. The spending for the new worldwide ads depends on how many local markets decide to run them. Since Heineken is sold in 174 countries, widespread acceptance could bring a beer moment or two for Lowe Lintas.</p>
