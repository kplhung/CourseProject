        <p>The Clinton administration today proposed strict new regulations of arsenic in tap water, reducing by 90 percent the public's maximum exposure to the chemical, which causes cancer and is found at harmful levels in at least 1 out of 10 of the nation's community water supplies.</p>
        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency issued the proposal after  having missed a deadline of Jan. 1 under the Safe Drinking Water Act of 1996. Environmentalists had threatened to sue the agency if it did not move quickly.</p>
        <p>The agency proposed lowering the limit on arsenic to 5 parts per billion from 50 parts per billion by using additives, filtering or other methods. The E.P.A. estimated that this approach would cost $374 million a year and would prevent scores of cancer cases each year and provide other major health benefits.</p>
        <p>Water utilities, while agreeing that the rules should be tightened, contended that this level of control would cost about four times more than the agency said and that the health benefits were not worth such an effort. Environmentalists called for an even stricter rule, saying the agency was accepting unusually high cancer risks in this approach.</p>
        <p>''The subject of arsenic has been debated at the E.P.A. for the better part of a decade or more,'' said Charles J. Fox, the agency's assistant administrator for water programs. ''We think this is affordable, and it is important for public health protection. But in some communities they will see increases in drinking water rates to pay for this additional health protection.''</p>
        <p>The agency said the costs per household might be about $28 a year in households in larger cities, and about $85 per household in communities of less than 10,000 households. The E.P.A. makes billions of dollars in loans to cities to help pay the cost of its regulations on drinking water.</p>
        <p>The burden would fall most heavily in the Southwest, where many communities have tap water with high levels of arsenic. Other communities in the West, the Midwest and New England would be affected, especially those that rely on water found underground rather than streams and other surface water for their drinking water supplies.</p>
        <p>For example, the Albuquerque water system, which serves more than 400,000 people, has an arsenic level of 14 parts per billion, and the Norman, Okla., water system, which serves 80,000 people, has arsenic levels at about 36 parts per billion, according to federal data complied by the Natural Resources Defense Council.</p>
        <p>The agency estimated that 6,600 utilities, which represent about 12 percent of all water suppliers in the nation and serve some 22 million people, would have to take corrective action, and that the vast majority of them serve 10,000 homes or fewer.</p>
        <p>Arsenic in drinking water commonly comes from natural sources in the ground, but some can also come from industrial pollution. Its occurrence varies widely; New York City's water, for example, is essentially arsenic-free and meets the new standards.</p>
        <p>In some communities, people may face a risk as high as 1 in 100 of developing cancer from contaminated water, according to a study published last year by the National Research Council. For decades, Congress has called for the agency to review its rules, but the agency, citing uncertainties over the costs and benefits, has never before issued a proposal.</p>
        <p>While few experts argue against taking action to protect people better from arsenic, which can cause not only lung, skin and bladder cancer but also diseases of the liver, blood vessels and other organs, there is still a dispute over how strictly the agency should regulate it.</p>
        <p>Erik Olson, a senior lawyer at the Natural Resources Defense Council, objected that the E.P.A. proposal would provide a cancer risk of 1 in 10,000, a claim that the agency confirmed.</p>
        <p>''Although it is a very significant step forward,'' Mr. Olson said, ''it would still provide a higher cancer risk than any other E.P.A. rule for tap water. I think that is a pretty serious precedent for the agency to be undertaking.''</p>
        <p>His environmental advocacy group has urged the agency to adopt a standard of 3 parts per billion, the strictest standard that is considered feasible with existing technology.</p>
        <p>Doug Marsano, a spokesman for the American Water Works Association, which represents water utilities, said the group had called for a standard of 10 parts per billion -- twice what the E.P.A. is proposing, and equal to the recommendation of the World Health Organization. That standard would bring reductions in the vast majority of cities where arsenic is a problem, Mr. Marsano said.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A.'s draft proposal, prepared after years of discussions with health officials, water districts and the public, was held up at the White House for review until this month.</p>
        <p>The agency's new proposal is a compromise, but leaves open the possibility of seeking higher or lower standards after a period of public comment.</p>
        <p>The agency asks the public to comment on several alternatives: a 20 parts per billion standard, the 10 parts per billion standard that the water utilities have endorsed, the 5 parts per billion standard that the E.P.A. favors, and the 3 parts per billion standard. A decision is to be made within a year.</p>
        <p>The agency's economic studies conducted over the past few years found that the standard of 10 parts per billion would cost half as much as its proposal, and that the standard of 3 parts per billion would cost twice as much as its proposal.</p>
        <p>For each notch that the regulatory vise is tightened, there would be a corresponding reduction in cancers, the agency's scientists found. But the improvements would be relatively slight. And because most of the cancers at each level of control would be curable, the agency deemed that the health gains were worth only so much money spent cleaning up water supplies.</p>
        <p>Large water systems would probably treat their water with relatively efficient technologies like filtering and adding lime. But systems that serve fewer than 10,000 people would probably choose less efficient methods, and the costs of treatment per household would probably be higher there. Large systems would be given three years to comply, and small systems five years.</p>
        <p>THE LOCAL SITUATION  How to Check Water</p>
        <p>CONSUMER CONFIDENCE REPORTS Beginning last year, local water utilities are required to send a consumer confidence report once a year with their water utility bill. The report has information on all contaminants, including arsenic, and the amounts found in the local water supply.</p>
        <p>WHERE TO GET INFORMATION Call the Environmental Protection Agency's Safe Drinking Water Hot Line at (800) 426-4791 for the number of your water utility and ask for a consumer confidence report. Or check the E.P.A.'s Web site for more information: www.epa.gov/safewater/dwinfo.htm</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 30, 2000, Tuesday  A front-page article on Thursday about proposed regulations to limit arsenic in tap water referred incorrectly to estimates of the cancer risk under the proposed standard of five parts per billion. The Environmental Protection Agency's estimate of risk, approximately 1 in 10,000, pertains only to bladder cancer, the most thoroughly studied health risk, and does not reflect other forms of cancer that can also be caused by arsenic.</p>
        <p>The article also referred incompletely to environmentalists' threat of a lawsuit if the Clinton administration did not propose the new regulations quickly. The Natural Resources Defense Council, an advocacy group, filed such a suit on May 10 to force the release of the proposal.</p>
