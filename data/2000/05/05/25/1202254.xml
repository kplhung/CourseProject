        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>GERMANY: DEFENSE CHIEF QUITS -- The chief of Germany's defense staff announced his resignation the day after Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping said the army required drastic reform. Gen. Hans-Peter von Kirchbach favored fewer cuts in troops and the scale of the draft than those proposed by an independent commission. He will be replaced on July 1 by Gen. Harald Kujat, above, the current head of defense planning.</p>

        <p>AUSTRIA: HAIDER DEFAMED -- A Vienna court has fined a prominent political scientist, Anton Pelinka, $4,800 for defaming Jorg Haider, leader of the rightist Freedom Party. In a television interview Professor Pelinka said Mr. Haider had ''trivialized'' Nazism and made certain National Socialist positions ''more politically acceptable.'' The case was initially filed by Dieter Bohmdorfer, then Mr. Haider's lawyer and now justice minister. The International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights called the conviction ''a miscarriage of justice,'' especially in light of the justice minister's role.</p>

        <p>RUSSIA: 6-NATION PACT -- Russia and five other former Soviet nations agreed on new measures to jointly fight terrorism and drug and weapons smuggling, including rules governing when they collectively intervene in crises, use force and conduct peacekeeping missions. The treaty updates a 1992 pact among Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Armenia.</p>
        <p>Michael Wines (NYT)</p>
        <p>NETHERLANDS: LOCKERBIE TRIAL RESUMES -- The chief investigator into the 1988 Lockerbie crash described how it turned into a murder inquiry as the trial of two Libyans accused of bombing the Pan Am flight resumed. The spread of the wreckage over 850 square miles suggested a midair disintegration, he testified, and, within a week, analysis determined that a plastic explosive had been used.</p>
        <p>Donald G. McNeil Jr. (NYT)</p>
        <p>CZECH REPUBLIC: JEWISH PROPERTY -- The lower chamber of Parliament voted to return to its original owners state-owned property confiscated from Jews during the Nazi occupation. Under the proposal, now going to the upper chamber, Jewish communities would receive all immovable property confiscated between Sept. 29, 1938, and May 8, 1945, and now state-owned. The government estimates some 200 buildings would be returned. The Jewish Museum in Prague would also receive 63 paintings now in the Czech Republic's National Gallery.</p>

        <p>NIGERIA: 100 KILLED -- At least 100 people were reported killed in the northern city of Kaduna in the latest clash between Christians and Muslims. Religious conflicts in March led to the deaths of hundreds in Kaduna and in Aba in the mainly Christian southeast. The recent fighting is said to have started after Kaduna Christians blamed a Muslim for a Christian's death.</p>

        <p>PERU: COMPUTER TESTS -- Election officials tested computers intended to assure a clean presidential runoff vote on Sunday, as sometimes violent street protests calling for a postponement of the vote continued. Election observers and diplomats said privately that they hoped officials would find flaws in the ballot counting system, giving President Alberto K. Fujimori a reason to postpone the vote and enabling Alejandro Toledo, his challenger, to get back in the race.</p>

        <p>CANADA: NURSES STRIKE -- About 10,000 unionized nurses and nurses' aides in Alberta staged an illegal strike. It was the latest confrontation over state-run health in a western province where the premier, Ralph Klein, has taken steps to increase the role of private, nonunionized health care. The nurses say they are paid about 15 percent less than nurses in Ontario, a province with a lower per capita income.</p>

        <p>ASIA</p>
        <p>SOUTH KOREA: TIES THAWING -- In a conciliatory gesture before a meeting June 12 of the leaders of the two Koreas, South Korea plans to allow a North Korean-made movie to be shown in the South for the first time. As part of a thaw in relations, a North Korean children's art troupe arrived in Seoul for musical and dance performances to celebrate the summit talks.</p>
        <p>Samuel Len (NYT)</p>
        <p>NORTH KOREA: U.S. TALKS RESUME -- The United States and North Korea resumed talks on a wide range of issues intended to improve relations, including an accord to defuse a nuclear crisis. The meeting, in Rome, is a followup to talks adjourned March 15 in New York. Under a 1994 pact North Korea agreed to freeze its nuclear weapons program in return for the building of two reactors not to be used for military purposes. But delays have plagued the project.</p>

        <p>IRAQ ARMS MONITORS -- The head of a new commission on arms monitoring and inspection in Iraq is moving ahead with the staffing of his advisory panel. An American expert is likely to be put in charge of training and equipping the commission, with Europeans holding other crucial positions, officials say.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: NO TRIAL FOR WEIZMAN -- Prosecutors decided not to file criminal charges against President Ezer Weizman for accepting more than $300,000 from the French millionaire Edouard Saroussi. President Weizman said that he was pleased but that he still intended to step down by year's end -- two years early. Mr. Weizman, 76, was reported to have accepted the money while serving in the cabinet from 1987 to 1993.</p>
        <p>(Reuters)</p>
        <p>IRAN: JEWS' DEFENSE -- The defense in the espionage trial of 13 Jews chipped away at confessions by the accused and demanded confirmation that material said to have been passed to Israel was in fact secret. The defense team bitterly attacked the state broadcasting service for airing admissions in what the court had said would be a closed hearing. The trial is scheduled to resume Monday.</p>
        <p>(Reuters)</p>
        <p>IRAN, IRAQ: PRISONERS FREED -- Iran has freed 460 Iraqi prisoners from the 1980-88 war between the two countries, the International Committee of the Red Cross said. But an Iraqi foreign ministry spokesman said Tehran had delayed the release of Iraqis, some of them jailed since 1982. The freed men brought to 2,939 the number of Iraqis released by Iran since last month: 1,999 were released in April and 480 earlier in May.</p>

        <p>Correction:  May 26, 2000, Friday  Because of an editing error, an article in some copies yesterday about the new United Nations commission for inspecting Iraqi weapons referred incorrectly to the unit being formed by the commission's chairman, Hans Blix. It is the inspection commission; his advisory panel already exists.</p>
