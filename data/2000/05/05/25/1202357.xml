        <p>David Duval spent the past week fighting a severe cold, but he has been fighting his putting stroke all year.</p>
        <p>Still looking for his first victory since April 1999, Duval will join Tiger Woods, Vijay Singh, Hal Sutton and Ernie Els among the top players competing at Jack Nicklaus's Memorial Tournament, which begins today at Muirfield Village Golf Club in Dublin, Ohio. Nicklaus will be competing in the event.</p>
        <p>Duval is still the No. 2 player in the world ranking, but putting has become his No. 1 problem. Last year, Duval ranked No. 10 on the PGA Tour in putting. This year, Duval is ranked 101st in putting, averaging 29.64 putts per round.</p>
        <p>''If you look at all the statistics from last year, everything is about the same except my putting,'' said Duval, who is eighth on this year's money list with more than $1.31 million in earnings. ''I'm very close to being where I want to be, and I'm looking forward to this week.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Woods will play a Nike ball in competition for the second consecutive week. After using a Titleist ball throughout his career, Woods switched to the Nike ball for the first time last week at the Deutsche Bank-SAP Open in Germany, fueling speculation that he would make a permanent switch to the Nike ball.</p>
        <p>''I'm just testing it out,'' Woods said. ''Since I'm playing well, if you're going to try something out, try it when you're playing well. If you're struggling and can't find your game, it's not a good time to switch equipment.''</p>
        <p>Woods is this week's defending champion, but he has never successfully defended a tournament since turning professional. What does Woods think of that fact?</p>
        <p>''To be honest, I could care less,'' he said. ''I've always believed once you're at a tournament site, then your reign is over. You're a champion of the tournament for 51 weeks. When the week comes around, the tournament is up for grabs.''</p>
