        <p>COLD. The entire Eric Lindros saga is cold. He probably should not even be playing, given his history of concussions. The Philadelphia Flyers give the impression that he is superfluous. And he may be playing for all the wrong reasons, like retaining his value for next year.</p>
        <p>Wanted or unwanted, Lindros was the only Flyer who could put the puck into the net last night, whether it counted or not. Wearing his familiar No. 88, he scored the Flyers' only goal with 30.1 seconds left in a 2-1 loss to the Devils and he also flipped in a goal just after the second period ended.</p>

        <p>COLD. The entire Eric Lindros saga is cold. He probably should not even be playing, given his history of concussions. The Philadelphia Flyers give the impression that he is superfluous. And he may be playing for all the wrong reasons, like retaining his value for next year.</p>
        <p>Wanted or unwanted, Lindros was the only Flyer who could put the puck into the net last night, whether it counted or not. Wearing his familiar No. 88, he scored the Flyers' only goal with 30.1 seconds left in a 2-1 loss to the Devils and he also flipped in a goal just after the second period ended.</p>
        <p>The big boy is back, but even his looming presence did not help, as the Devils averted the dreaded handshake line ''in our building,'' as the players put it. The series final will be tomorrow night in Philadelphia, and the joke of it is that the best player on the Flyers' roster, at 27, will be needed to get the Flyers into the Stanley Cup finals.</p>
        <p>''He'll help us in Game 7,'' Keith Primeau said after the Flyers were upended for the second straight game.</p>
        <p>Lindros is one of the top players in history, but earlier in the season the team ripped the captain's C from his jersey, a disgrace in hockey, which values the captaincy more than any other sport does.</p>
        <p>Even without the captaincy, Lindros was a force. He took regular but short shifts, not showing the brute speed that allowed him to outrace Mark Messier in an epic duel in the 1997 playoffs, but that was to be expected. He also leveled the pesky Claude Lemieux in the first period, without repercussions.</p>
        <p>''As the game went on, I felt more comfortable,'' Lindros said later. ''If felt good to get out and play hockey.''</p>
        <p>His size and his skills made him the first player to put the puck in the net last night, but the action came clearly after the buzzer ending the second period. Once the Devils had their two goals, Lindros scored from in front. Later, he got involved in a skirmish, but the durable linesman, Kevin Collins, shooed him away from even the possibility of a stray punch.</p>
        <p>He has gone through the parade of team doctors and concussion specialists, sitting out the entire playoffs while his brain tried to stabilize itself. This is serious business. There is considerable reason to believe Lindros should retire, the way his kid brother did after his concussions.</p>
        <p>''I was assured everything would be fine,'' he said, then he referred to his brother's injuries: ''It did enter my mind once in a while.''</p>
        <p>Nobody took a major run at him all night, but Lindros said he was not worried, and he said he didn't worry about the effect of an inevitable crunch to his brain.</p>
        <p>There should have been an aura to his gallantry in coming back from the latest concussion. Hockey players look to their best player for inspiration. The Rangers used to know when Mark Messier had trouble flexing a knee, but the man they called Mess folded his arms across his rugged chest and gave his bland Mr. Clean smile and pronounced that the Rangers would win the next game. And more often than not, they did.</p>
        <p>For all the toughness, Lindros's self-involvement, the machinations of his agent-father, and Lindros's criticism of the team medical process had made him virtually persona non grata. His return was a chilly contrast to that accorded other great players who struggled with pain -- Willis Reed, hobbling out of the runway to help the Knicks win the 1970 championship; Mickey Mantle, playing with blood seeping into his uniform from an infection during the 1961 World Series.</p>
        <p>The Boston Bruins always hoped Bobby Orr's knee was stable enough for him to go out on the ice. The old Islanders would glance at wan Mike Bossy sneaking a cigarette in a corner of the room, knowing he would find a way to ignore his bad back.</p>
        <p>Mario Lemieux won Stanley Cups and scoring titles and came back from Hodgkin's disease. And the current Flyers know that their president, Bobby Clarke, earned all those gaps in his jack-o'-lantern smile in the ancient Stanley Cup photos of the Broad Street Bullies, but that he played as a diabetic. And John LeClair was playing last night with 39 stitches in his face, a souvenir of this series.</p>
        <p>Eric Lindros does not lack for courage, nor does he lack in skill, but in dynamics traditionally alien to hockey, his feud with Clarke has set him apart from his teammates. Last night their warmest praise was that he might help them win the deciding seventh game. Cold.</p>
