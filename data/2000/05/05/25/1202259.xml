        <p>With his recent speeches on Social Security and nuclear weapons defenses, Gov. George W. Bush this month has established a pattern:  He put forward broad ideas with great appeal to the Republican base and then left the details to be filled in later should he be elected.</p>
        <p>So in rapid succession, Mr. Bush  promised to introduce individual investment accounts into Social Security but left out fundamental details like what portion of the payroll tax he would devote to them. And similarly this week, he opened the door to unilateral nuclear weapons reductions coupled with a missile defense system that would protect all 50 states and many of America's allies.</p>
        <p>But once again he included no specifics -- or any notion of what it would cost.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides and supporters argue that on certain kinds of issues this is the most effective way to lead, that locking into particulars now ensures failure later. Yet it is also the case that the governor's style has some other effects too: It allows him to look like a leader while making it much more difficult for his opponents to get a handhold to grapple with him and his ideas.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore is the master of picking apart the details of a proposal. Just remember what he did to former Senator Bill Bradley's health care plan in the Democratic primaries.</p>
        <p>But in the Social Security debate he has been left assailing Mr. Bush's ''secret plan'' and trying to fill in the details for his Republican opponent, as he did today in an interview on National Public Radio. Mr. Gore said the transition to individual accounts would inevitably also entail ''raising the retirement age or cutting benefits.''</p>
        <p>Still Douglas Hattaway, Mr. Gore's spokesman acknowledged, speaking of Mr. Bush, ''It's harder to have a real debate on the issues when he refuses to say what he really intends to do.''</p>
        <p>The move toward individual investment retirement accounts and the idea of a missile defense shield have long been dear to Republicans and some of their constituencies. It was Ronald Reagan, after all, who first called for a Strategic Defense Initiative in 1983.</p>
        <p>But these ideas have foundered in the past, not just because of partisan strife, but because of details. Missile defense technology is still largely unproven. The Pentagon suffered a serious setback in January when a missile fired from the Marshall Islands failed to hit a mock warhead fired from a California air base. And the costs are high.</p>
        <p>The limited missile defense system under development, which envisions bases in Alaska with 100 interceptor missiles, has been estimated by the Congressional Budget Office to cost $60 billion. A broader system, which Mr. Bush is considering, might cost $116 billion or more.</p>
        <p>On Social Security, while many  Congressional plans contain some elements of individual accounts like those proposed by Mr. Bush, the details, too, have been problematic. A number of the plans also contain painful medicine like benefit cuts, lower cost-of-living increases or an increase in the retirement age.</p>
        <p>In one case, conservative Republicans found that the only way to create such accounts and still keep Social Security solvent was to require people to hand their accounts back to the government when they retired and then receive a fixed annual annuity.</p>
        <p>That is hardly what Mr. Bush has been describing when he says his  plans will allow Americans to build wealth that they can then pass on to their children.</p>
        <p>Should voters know the full costs and benefits of Mr. Bush's ideas? Anita Dunn, who was Mr. Bradley's communications director, argues that they should -- even if such details could make the plans a fat target in the way Mr. Bradley's health care proposal became.</p>
        <p>''To the extent that we failed to effectively defend a well-thought-out, comprehensive plan, does not mean that's not the right way to go,'' Ms. Dunn said. ''It just means you should aggressively defend your plan.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides and some political scientists counter that there are some issues on which too much detail is counterproductive to governing. And they point to the fate of another doomed health care plan: the one championed by Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>''Anybody who announces something initially and provides enormously great detail runs a terrible risk of having it fail because of particular flaws rather than the overall genius of the idea,'' said Ross K. Baker, a professor of political science at Rutgers University.</p>
        <p>By leaving out the details of Mr. Bush's Social Security plan, his aides say, Mr. Bush will allow Congress to help shape the plan and have pride of authorship. They note that this is how the governor operated in Texas, presenting basic concepts and allowing the Legislature to shape the details.</p>
        <p>And on nuclear deterrence, they say, detail must be left to the military.</p>
        <p>''It would be wrong for a politician to arbitrarily set the number of missiles needed to defend the nation,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Mr. Bush. ''That's exactly why you have a Pentagon.''</p>
        <p>Will Mr. Bush eventually have to provide more detail on these issues as November nears? Some supporters of Mr. Bush say no, that what voters want now -- particularly independent voters -- is a sign that a presidential candidate will put forward ideas that may break the gridlock in Washington.</p>
        <p>But others say he will be forced to fill in more particulars as time goes on or pay a price.</p>
        <p>''The initial excitement in getting a new idea out is not a measure of where the idea ends up,'' Ms. Dunn said, speaking from Mr. Bradley's primary experience. ''It is early. He hasn't had to debate Gore. And he hasn't been challenged.''</p>
