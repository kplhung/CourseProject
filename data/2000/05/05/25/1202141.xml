        <p>Responding to continuing concerns about the eligibility of some shows, the Tony administration committee announced yesterday that it would establish a new category of award next season: special theatrical event.</p>
        <p>The award is intended for productions that do not fit into existing categories of best play, best musical or best revival.</p>
        <p>''With many new forms of entertainment being produced on Broadway, the committee felt the current categories were not sufficient,'' said Roy A. Somlyo, president of the American Theater Wing, which founded the awards in 1947.</p>
        <p>The new category is being introduced after controversy over ''Contact,'' the dance-oriented musical currently playing at Lincoln Center's Vivian Beaumont Theater. In April, the administration committee ruled that ''Contact'' could be considered as a new musical, though it does not use a live orchestra or have an original score or a substantial book. ''Contact,'' developed by the choreographer Susan Stroman and the writer John Weidman, consists of three scenes, each involving dancers performing to recorded music.</p>
        <p>Several groups, including Local 802, the Broadway musicians' union, have complained about that decision, arguing that Tony voters should have an option other than wedging an unconventional piece into a category.</p>
        <p>In a separate decision, the committee also ruled that Studio 54, the home of the long-running hit ''Cabaret,'' would be deemed a Tony-eligible theater, meaning that future productions there can be considered for awards.</p>
        <p>This year's awards are to be announced at Radio City Music Hall on June 4.</p>
