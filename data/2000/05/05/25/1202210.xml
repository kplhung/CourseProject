        <p>There is a morbid expression that no one ever got rich hauling passengers. Not the railroads. Not the buses. Not the airlines.</p>
        <p>That is the backdrop for the proposed takeover of US Airways, the sixth-largest domestic carrier, by United Airlines, the world's largest carrier. Ordinarily, a merger that decreased competition would be worrisome. But airlines are not ordinary. Though profitable over the past couple of years during ebullient economic times, they struggle year in and year out to make a decent profit. They are plagued by chronic excess capacity and gigantic losses when the economy slips. By wringing out excess costs and creating large networks that provide lots of travel options and convenient schedules, mergers can do consumers more good than harm.  Whether that is true in this case will not be known until the Justice Department completes an exhaustive review.</p>

        <p>There is a morbid expression that no one ever got rich hauling passengers. Not the railroads. Not the buses. Not the airlines.</p>
        <p>That is the backdrop for the proposed takeover of US Airways, the sixth-largest domestic carrier, by United Airlines, the world's largest carrier. Ordinarily, a merger that decreased competition would be worrisome. But airlines are not ordinary. Though profitable over the past couple of years during ebullient economic times, they struggle year in and year out to make a decent profit. They are plagued by chronic excess capacity and gigantic losses when the economy slips. By wringing out excess costs and creating large networks that provide lots of travel options and convenient schedules, mergers can do consumers more good than harm.  Whether that is true in this case will not be known until the Justice Department completes an exhaustive review.</p>
        <p>United, whose employees own a majority of the company, has many international partners and domestic routes that spread out from centrally located ''hub'' airports. The merger gives it more routes in lucrative eastern markets and a prized asset, the shuttle route from Boston to New York to Washington. US Airways, by contrast, lacks international heft and even full national reach. Its labor costs are high and its labor relations sour. It is racking up losses even as the rest of the industry makes record profits. For this struggling carrier, United offers a lifeline. If Justice decides that US Airways cannot survive on its own and that the merged airline will offer travelers better schedules, one-stop ticketing and more attractive frequent-flier programs, then approval will follow.</p>
        <p>But Justice has taken an aggressive stance against airline mergers, for good reason. There are often specific airports -- in this case, in Washington, Baltimore, New York and Boston -- where mergers threaten to strip travelers of competition. To solve this problem at Reagan National Airport in Washington, US Airways has announced it would turn over many of its routes to a new airline, DC Air. Justice, however, may find other pockets of diminished competition and demand further divestiture.</p>
        <p>Travelers often blame the airline deregulation of the late 1970's, and the merger wave it spawned, for flight delays, baggage mix-ups, cramped leg room and other woes. But most of this criticism is misplaced, according to a recent study by Clifford  Winston of the Brookings Institution and Steven Morrison of Northeastern University. Mergers, they say, have not raised fares and have been pursued to cut costs. Indeed, average prices have fallen by more than 25 percent under deregulation.</p>
        <p>True, travelers flying to locations served by only one airline may find themselves paying prices they consider exorbitant. There are also some troubling allegations of anticompetitive behavior, such as attempts by large carriers at their hub airports to drive smaller rivals out of business by cutting prices temporarily to punishingly low levels and then raising them when the competition is driven away. It will be Justice's task to determine whether this proposed merger is benign or threatens to jack up prices and diminish service.</p>
        <p>Labor opposition could still derail the merger. The pilots' union at United scuttled an earlier effort to merge the two carriers out of fear that many of its members would lose seniority. Meshing the employee-owners of United with the often disgruntled, costly employees of US Airways may prove a graver threat to completing the merger than anything thrown in the way by antitrust authorities.</p>
