        <p>With just hours left for him to act, Gov. George E. Pataki made a series of demands before he would sign a bill that would make New York the first state to require that cigarettes meet fire-safety standards.</p>
        <p>Legislators from both parties predicted that he would sign the measure by the midnight deadline on Wednesday. The governor's office said it would not reveal what he had done until later this morning.</p>
        <p>The bill, which has been hailed as a landmark measure by anti-tobacco groups, passed the Assembly and the Senate more than a month ago, without a single dissenting vote. But the governor has repeatedly refused to give his views of it, and he did not inform the Legislature of his conditions until Wednesday, the last day he had, by law, to act on it.</p>
        <p>Republicans and Democrats in both houses expressed frustration with Mr. Pataki's handling of the bill, saying that he was trying to use it as leverage to win concessions on issues not directly related to it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki asked the Legislature to delay the fire-safety standards by several months to make it easier for tobacco companies to comply, and to impose fines on retailers that violate the law. Officials in both parties, in both houses of the Legislature, said they agreed on Wednesday to those demands, which would be addressed in a follow-up bill.</p>
        <p>But the governor also imposed a second set of conditions, seeking tough new criminal penalties for tobacco ''bootleggers'' who try to import or sell cigarettes without paying New York's $1.11-per-pack tax, the highest in the nation; and restricting Internet sales, which are now used to avoid payment of state taxes.</p>
        <p>Lawmakers in both houses said that they did not necessarily object to his demands, but that such complex issues should not have been raised at the last minute and should not hold up the bill.</p>
        <p>''This issue of fire safety should stand on its own,'' said Senator Frank Padavan, a Queens Republican who sponsored the bill in his house. ''We don't think that is something that has to be done as part of this process. The governor has indicated that he supports the general thrust of our bill, which is welcome news, and we hope he'll sign it.''</p>
        <p>Alexander B. Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat who sponsored the Assembly bill, said, ''I'm very confident we will reach an agreement and the governor will approve the bill.''</p>
        <p>Cigarettes have long been made so that once lighted, they keep burning, even when they are not being smoked. Anti-tobacco advocates and some firefighters' groups have called for laws that would require cigarettes to go out if they were not puffed on for a few minutes, so that they would pose less of a fire risk. That requirement, they contend, would prevent hundreds of fire deaths nationally each year.</p>
        <p>The bill passed by the Legislature instructs the State Office of Fire Prevention and Control to come up with flammability standards by Nov. 1, 2001, after which cigarette makers would have 30 days to comply. Lawmakers said that in response to the governor, they agreed to change that provision to six months and impose a $1,000 fine on retailers found selling cigarettes violating the standards.</p>
        <p>Several brands of self-extinguishing cigarettes are already on the market, including More, Merit, Virginia Slims, Capri Light and Eve Lights. Some are based on the use of thicker paper, others on altered chemical composition of the paper. Internal industry reports that have been leaked say that making cigarettes less flammable does not significantly raise the cost of making them or affect their taste.</p>
        <p>But the law would result in lower sales, because a smoker who walked away from a lighted cigarette for a few minutes would find not ashes, but a stub that could be relighted.</p>
        <p>The tobacco industry, hobbled by a number of recent setbacks, waged a muted lobbying campaign against the bill, arguing that it should be subject to a single national standard rather than state-by-state rules. Such a standard, in fact, is also the hope of anti-tobacco advocates.</p>
        <p>''Our basic thrust is not only to do something in New York State, but also to motivate the Congress to act, which they've spent years and years not doing,'' Mr. Padavan said. ''If we can do it in New York, I think that would have an awful lot of impact nationally.''</p>
        <p>Cigarette makers have suffered a string of serious defeats, many of them in New York, since agreeing in late 1998 to pay the states $246 billion over 25 years to settle lawsuits seeking reimbursement for smoking-related health care costs.</p>
        <p>As part of those settlements the industry disbanded the Tobacco Institute, its powerful lobbying and research arm. Then, last year, it was revealed that the chief New York lobbyist for the Philip Morris Companies, the world's largest cigarette maker, had routinely falsified lobbying reports filed with the state. The company and the lobbyist were fined, and she was barred from lobbying in the state for three years.</p>
        <p>In December, the governor and the Legislature doubled the state's tobacco tax to pay for a new health care program for the poor. The Senate had long refused to act on the fire-safety bill, which had passed the Assembly several times, but in April, the Senate approved the measure.</p>
