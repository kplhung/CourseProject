        <p>Hastily improvised negotiations among the main presidential candidates on Tuesday demonstrated the power that television has gained in Mexican politics when the talks went sour for the opposition contender.</p>
        <p>The meeting was called to discuss whether to go ahead with the second of two debates that had been canceled. Vicente Fox, the opposition candidate who has taken the lead in public opinion polls, had tried to score points by demanding that the three main candidates proceed with a planned debate on Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>Abruptly, his opponents, Francisco Labastida of the governing party and the leftist candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, agreed to meet him to discuss the rules. Mr. Fox invited television cameras to the talks, and for most of the next two hours found himself pummeled by Mr. Labastida and Mr. Cardenas, who accused Mr. Fox of being needlessly difficult. After hours of heated exchanges, Mr. Fox's opponents rose and walked out of the meeting as cameras whirred away.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Labastida was openly triumphant, declaring, ''Fox is going into a free fall.'' Most headlines seemed to agree like the one in Milenio, a daily here, that said, ''Fox Acts Spoiled, Live and in Color.'' And though Mr. Fox insisted that he had achieved his goal of flushing out the collusion of Mr. Labastida and Mr. Cardenas, his advisers acknowledged that his performance had at least temporarily knocked the wind from his campaign.</p>
        <p>After some hesitation, he also announced that he would participate in the next debate, scheduled for Friday.</p>
        <p>For a country still new to the rough and tumble of a real campaign after 71 years of dominance by a single party, the confrontation offered an exhilarating glimpse of presidential candidates' slugging it out without makeup or rules.</p>
        <p>Although much can still change before the election, on July 2, for now at least, the awkward meeting threatened to neutralize the lead that Mr. Fox has taken as the outsider battling against the entrenched Institutional Revolutionary Party of Mr. Labastida.</p>
        <p>Two weeks ago, the Reuters news agency published a nationwide poll, with a margin of error of 3.2 percent, showing Mr. Fox backed by 46.3 percent of voters, Mr. Labastida by 41.6 and Mr. Cardenas by 9.3. But several polls published since have been a cacophony of contradictions, leaving Mexicans uncertain about who is the front-runner.</p>
        <p>The encounter on Tuesday capped three days of television programming in which the two Mexican networks relaxed their starchy news formats and interviewed the three candidates from remote locations simultaneously, a la ''Nightline'' on ABC-TV, allowing them to respond to one another's increasingly vituperative remarks.</p>
        <p>''This was something completely new for Mexico,'' said Raul Trejo Delarbre, a professor here who studies the media. ''There were no clear rules, and nobody knew quite how to react.''</p>
        <p>This new format reached an extreme in the encounter on Tuesday, in which cameras rolled for two hours as the candidates sat at a table in a garden, exploring their differences about whether to have a formal debate -- without a moderator or anyone else in charge.</p>
        <p>A scowling Mr. Fox insisted repeatedly that all three men go forward that night with the debate, as originally planned and subsequently canceled. He also appeared to misrepresent an offer by the top television network to broadcast the event.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cardenas and Mr. Labastida repeatedly jeered at Mr. Fox, portraying him as obstinate for repeatedly pushing to debate on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>Over Mr. Fox's objections, his opponents agreed to debate on Friday. Then they stood up and ended the meeting, with Mr. Fox sitting alone, staring glumly at the cameras in silence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox agonized before deciding to attend the debate on Friday.</p>
        <p>''Our choice is to go into the debate, now on their terrain, in which case Cuauhtemoc and Labastida will both attack me, or to take our campaign back on the road, to the people, in which case they will say I was afraid to debate,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Labastida, whose campaign had been steadily leaking votes, sounded jubilant about Mr. Fox's misstep in an interview today as he drove to a suburban rally of 10,000 cheering supporters.</p>
        <p>''Everyone can see he doesn't know the difference between his fantasies and reality,'' Mr. Labastida said. ''He also manipulated the truth. Mexicans don't like that.''</p>
