        <p>The athletic director for the Massapequa schools was charged yesterday with stealing more than $12,000 from a nonprofit group he helped found three years ago to honor successful Massapequa High School graduates and award scholarships to college-bound seniors.</p>
        <p>The authorities in Nassau County said Kevin McCann, the school district athletic director for more than five years, used the money for personal expenses while he was treasurer of the Massapequa High School Hall of Fame from 1996 until 1999.</p>
        <p>They said an investigation began last fall after a school official who was also a director of the group found an unexpectedly low balance in the group's monthly bank statement and canceled checks for what appeared to be personal expenses.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCann, 53, of Massapequa Park, an alumnus and employee of the district for more than 30 years, broke into tears when he was confronted by a school official, said Thomas J. Mason, an alumnus and counsel to the Hall of Fame group.</p>
        <p>At an arraignment yesterday in First District Court in Mineola on a grand larceny charge, which carries a prison term of up to seven years, Mr. McCann pleaded not guilty and was released without bail.</p>
        <p>Colin O'Donnell, an assistant Nassau County district attorney, said that Mr. McCann had repaid the full amount he was accused of stealing.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Donnell said Mr. McCann had used the Hall of Fame checkbook to make credit card and automobile insurance payments, among ''a variety of personal uses.''</p>
        <p>The group raised money by holding annual golf tournaments.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mason said board members felt ''anger, shock and dismay.''</p>
        <p>''What disturbed people most was the eternal question of why, why would he do this?'' Mr. Mason said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Lawrence Pereira, the district superintendent, said Mr. McCann remained athletic director. ''Right now we are awaiting the outcome of this process,'' he said, referring to the charges.</p>
        <p>A lawyer for Mr. McCann, Dennis Sweeney, did not answer messages left at his office yesterday. A message left on Mr. McCann's answering machine was also not answered.</p>
