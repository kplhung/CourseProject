        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I would suggest to the groups that are protesting and attempting to halt the distribution of the video game called ''Panty Raider: From Here to Immaturity'' that they look around at the game's neighbors (''Game Draws a Range of Protests,'' May 18).</p>
        <p>This is a landscape overpopulated with steroid- and silicone-pumped thugs and thugettes, armed to the pecs with high-powered weaponry. Groups wishing to stand against the deluge of entertainment that is mean-spirited, filled with pointless aggression or just in bad taste should realize that censorship is not the answer.</p>
        <p>People's attitudes will control the depth of this rising tide. If these types of games do not sell, others like them, or even worse, will not be created.</p>
        <p>BRIAN T. HESS  New York</p>
