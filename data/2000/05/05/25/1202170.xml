        <p>For the second time in just a few weeks, a large Japanese company appealed to its banks today to forgive billions of dollars in debts, intensifying pressure on Japan's stressed financial system.</p>
        <p>The decision by the Hazama Corporation, a general contractor, to request 400 billion yen, or $3.7 billion at current exchange rates, worth of debt forgiveness is yet another sign that the bad-loan problems of Japanese banks are far from over.</p>
        <p>On April 26, Sogo, a faltering Japanese retail company, astonished its bankers by asking them to write off 639 billion yen, or roughly $6 billion, in debts. That was the largest amount of debt forgiveness ever sought in Japan, where the practice is far from standard.</p>
        <p>The shock of Sogo's request was magnified a few days later when the senior executive in charge of the retailer's restructuring plans was found dead in his home, apparently having committed suicide.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, the company's lenders postponed a decision on the request for debt forgiveness, although its largest lender, the Industrial Bank of Japan, has said it is willing to do so.</p>
        <p>Sogo's outstanding debts to the Industrial Bank -- 180 billion yen, or $1.7 billion -- are roughly equivalent to a year's worth of operating profit, according to James P. Fiorillo, senior banking analyst at ING Barings here. Nor does the bank have sizable unrealized gains on its securities portfolio to offset such a write-off.</p>
        <p>''The question of whether to forgive these debts or not is a big one,'' Mr. Fiorillo said.</p>
        <p>Hazama's largest lender, Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, is apparently willing to waive 90 billion yen of the construction company's loans, according to Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading business daily.</p>
        <p>Changes in accounting standards are intensifying the pressure on troubled companies. In the fiscal year that began on April 1, they must value their real estate and securities holdings at market levels. The new rules also strictly limit their ability to hide their debts in the accounts of affiliates, requiring that they report their financial results on a consolidated basis.</p>
        <p>Including Hazawa and Sogo, more than 10 large companies have asked for debt relief this year. The greatest number seeking such forgiveness have come from the construction industry, and analysts warn that many more contractors are in similarly weak shape.</p>
        <p>Like Hazama, they took on loads of debt to finance real estate purchases in the 1980's, only to watch the value of that real estate plummet when Japan's economic bubble burst.</p>
        <p>But whether debt forgiveness will in fact help such ailing companies regain their footing is a matter of much debate here. Unlike in the United States, where creditors of distressed companies can force radical changes on businesses in exchange for debt relief, Japanese creditors have very little power to do that.</p>
        <p>''It would be much better if these companies went bankrupt,'' said Tadashi Nakamae, a prominent economist here. ''Debt forgiveness is only going to prolong their problems.''</p>
