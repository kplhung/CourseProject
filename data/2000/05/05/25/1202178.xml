        <p>At 6:45 this morning, after the last Israeli tank rumbled out of southern Lebanon ending a 22-year occupation, Maj. Kobi Dostakam shut and locked the gate of the border fence near this community at the northern tip of Israel. ''Now let's see what happens,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Through the night columns of tanks, artillery pieces and armored personnel carriers streamed out of a dozen outposts in Lebanon, and after they crossed into Israel this morning, many Israeli soldiers were ambivalent about the departure.</p>
        <p>Some wondered aloud whether it would finally restore calm to the border area, and cautioned that a possible flare-up of cross-border violence might turn back the clock.</p>
        <p>''This may not be our last time in Lebanon,'' said Shai Ben-Yishai, a  tank platoon commander. ''We may have to go back.''</p>
        <p>Others nearly celebrated, hoisting Israeli flags, smiling and waving as their armored vehicles lurched though the gate. ''It's over!'' one soldier shouted as he arrived.</p>
        <p>Shai Mor, who brought home a flag of Lebanon as a souvenir of his nine months of service at the town of Merj 'Uyun, said he felt both ''tremendous happiness and pain.''</p>
        <p>''Sadness because we surrendered in a way, and happiness because maybe soldiers will stop getting killed,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Sitting on his tank, Omri Israel said fighting Hezbollah guerrillas had become an exercise in futility. ''You can't win a guerrilla war,'' he said. ''I don't think we ran away. We left with dignity. We withdrew in order to win.''</p>
        <p>Hezbollah militants are now just across a double fence from Metulla, a farming community and vacation spot that lies alongside Kafr Kila, a southern Lebanese village that Hezbollah fighters entered this week.</p>
        <p>At a border crossing abandoned by the Israelis, militants and villagers looted stockrooms, drove off in army trucks and broke into cars left behind by members of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army who had fled to Israel.</p>
        <p>Other Hezbollah followers paraded in armored vehicles left by the militia, and gathered at the fence facing Metulla to wave flags, brandish weapons and chant slogans. Israeli soldiers, who in southern Lebanon had shot Hezbollah fighters on sight, now simply looked on.</p>
        <p>The new rules of engagement were in effect spelled out by the chief of the army's Northern Command, Maj. Gen. Gabi Ashkenazi, at a news conference.</p>
        <p>''I saw these people from four to five meters away,'' he said of the men gathered across the fence. ''I looked at him, he looked at me, I'm holding my weapon, and nothing happened. If he had fired, he would have died. He didn't fire. And that's the reality we have to adjust to.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Haim Sela, a resident of Metulla, discounted suggestions that Hezbollah guerrillas might shoot across the fence, asserting that Syria, which is the dominant power in Lebanon, did not want to provoke a harsh Israeli response.</p>
        <p>''They won't fire a single bullet at civilian communities because Assad doesn't want war with Israel,'' he said, referring to President Hafez al-Assad. ''The war here is over.''</p>
        <p>But at Kibbutz Misgav Am, a border settlement on a ridge above Metulla, Nurit Rapoport was not convinced. Gazing into southern Lebanon, Mrs. Rapoport said she suddenly felt more vulnerable.</p>
        <p>An abandoned Israeli position nearby in Lebanon was being dismantled, and ground had been prepared for a new fence hugging the perimeter of the kibbutz.</p>
        <p>''I feel like I've been stripped this morning,'' she said. ''I'm for the withdrawal, but I feel exposed.''</p>
