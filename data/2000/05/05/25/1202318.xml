        <p>Re ''Benefits and Drawbacks to Bush and Gore Proposals for Overhauling Social Security'' (news article, May 19): The most significant argument against privatizing part of Social Security is that diverting tax dollars out of the Social Security system increases the projected long-term shortfall in the program, leading to major cuts in benefits, increases in the retirement age and cuts in annual cost-of-living adjustments. These are cuts that are typically not fully replaced by any income from a private account.</p>

        <p>Re ''Benefits and Drawbacks to Bush and Gore Proposals for Overhauling Social Security'' (news article, May 19): The most significant argument against privatizing part of Social Security is that diverting tax dollars out of the Social Security system increases the projected long-term shortfall in the program, leading to major cuts in benefits, increases in the retirement age and cuts in annual cost-of-living adjustments. These are cuts that are typically not fully replaced by any income from a private account.</p>
        <p>For the one-third of Social Security beneficiaries who are not retired -- people with disabilities, widows and orphans -- private accounts do not replace any of the benefits cut during privatization.</p>
        <p>These are the central issues in the debate over the future of Social Security that deserve to be fully aired before the election, not after.</p>
