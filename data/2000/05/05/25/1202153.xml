        <p>IT may be true, as a well-known cartoon in The New Yorker claimed, that on the Internet, no one knows you are a dog. But according to the first studies of gender switching on the Internet, everyone probably has a pretty good idea of what kind of dog you are.</p>

        <p>IT may be true, as a well-known cartoon in The New Yorker claimed, that on the Internet, no one knows you are a dog. But according to the first studies of gender switching on the Internet, everyone probably has a pretty good idea of what kind of dog you are.</p>
        <p>A study in the current issue of the journal Information, Communication and Society said that 40 percent of participants in online communities have engaged in some form of gender switching, the practice of pretending to be someone of the opposite sex. Of those,  about half have given up the practice. The authors of the study say the results show that gender switching is, in fact, far less popular than some social scientists had claimed.</p>
        <p>''It means that if someone tells you online that they're female, they probably are,'' said Dr. Malcolm Parks, an associate professor of speech communication at the University of Washington and a co-author of the study. ''What we found was that gender switching wasn't nearly as common a phenomenon as people had thought. Most of the people we studied hadn't tried it, and those who did didn't do it for very long.''</p>
        <p>The study, titled ''The Social Geography of Gender-Switching in Virtual Environments on the Internet,'' surveyed 400 participants in online communities called MOO's (multiuser object-oriented systems). Sixty percent of participants in the study said they had never engaged in gender switching online and had no intention of doing so. Nineteen percent had previously dallied with gender switching but had stopped. The remaining 21 percent were actively posing as a person of the opposite sex at the time the study was taken. But the majority of active gender switchers spent only about 10 percent of their online time disguised as the opposite sex.</p>
        <p>The figure that 40 percent of online users have masqueraded as the opposite sex could strike many people as alarmingly high, not low. Dr. Parks conceded that the results are up for interpretation.</p>
        <p>''I think you can probably take these numbers several ways,'' Dr. Parks said. ''I don't find it remarkable that many people take advantage of the Internet to experience life as the other gender. It's just that it tends to be a temporary experience and not a comment on their offline sexuality.''</p>
        <p>Gender switching became a popular topic because of what academics and Internet commentators believed it did say about sexuality. For some Internet anthropologists, gender switching was an example of how fluid the idea of identity has become in the modern world. Some feminists saw it as another way of breaking down gender roles. At the other end of the political spectrum, some critics of the Internet regarded the practice as a threat that every 14-year-old online girlfriend is really a 45-year-old ex-convict with three-day stubble.</p>
        <p>But for all the anecdotal evidence about gender switching, no one had produced hard numbers, Dr. Parks said. ''I was skeptical of the extreme speculation on all sides,'' he said. ''A lot of pundits had talked about it, but nobody had done any research. We tried to get a more systematic handle on what was really going on, rather than just take part in an ill-informed debate.''</p>
        <p>To collect data, Dr. Parks and Lynne Roberts, a doctoral candidate at the Curtin University of Technology in Australia, conducted two random samples of participants in two MOO's, one dedicated to socializing and the other to role-playing. They wrote to  users by e-mail, asking them to fill out a questionnaire on a protected Web site. Dr. Parks said they sent out 2,200 requests and got 400 participants, a response rate of just under 20 percent.</p>
        <p>The study also found that people tended to assume other sexual identities for what Dr. Parks called ''benign reasons.'' The most common reasons were that the respondents were in role-playing MOO's or that they switched genders out of curiosity, for fun, to avoid sexual harassment or as a challenge to their online acting skills.</p>
        <p>The most common reasons that respondents did not want to assume other sexual identities were that they had no interest, that they found the practice of gender switching to be deceitful and that they wanted to present their real selves online. A reason given slightly less often was doubt about being able to pull off the ruse. ''It's a little like that line of Mark Twain's: It's always easier to tell the truth, because you don't have to remember what you said,'' Dr. Parks said.</p>
        <p>The most common reason for people to drop the practice of switching sexual identities was that it stopped being interesting or that their curiosity had been satisfied.</p>
        <p>The study also found little difference between those who practiced what has been called ''online transvestism'' and those who had not. Switchers and nonswitchers showed no significant differences in the categories of shyness, extroversion or neuroticism. The main predictors of switching seemed to be the amount of time a person had spent in a MOO, but not the amount of time spent on the Internet over all.</p>
        <p>Cynthia Haynes, a professor at the University of Texas at Dallas who has studied and created MOO's, said she was not surprised by the numbers. ''It is something people experiment with but do not continue with,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Haynes said gender switching received a disproportionate amount of attention because of fears about pedophiles roaming chat rooms in disguise. ''I don't dismiss that it happens in rare cases,'' she said, ''but that kind of press misrepresents most people's experiences online.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Annette Markham, a professor of communication studies at Virginia Tech and the author of ''Life Online,'' said the study may in fact overstate the phenomenon because gender switching is currently in vogue. ''Whenever you are asking people to respond via a survey,'' she said, ''you're going to get mixed findings.''</p>
        <p>She agreed, however, that most gender switching is temporary. ''It's a popular belief that people get lost in their online personas,'' she said. ''But that doesn't really hold up when you really study what people are doing online. They have a lot more balance than we think they do.''</p>
