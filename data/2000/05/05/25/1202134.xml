        <p>WHEN the director George Lucas and the producer Rick McCallum recently shot screen tests for ''Star Wars: Episode II,'' there was a problem. At the end of the successful shot, Mr. McCallum said, Mr. Lucas couldn't use the traditional director's cry of ''Cut! Print!'' because he was shooting on digital videotape, not film. After a moment's hesitation, Mr. McCallum said, a new finale was proposed: ''Cut! Can we take a quick look at it?''</p>
        <p>When ''Star Wars: Episode II'' starts production next month in Australia it will be  the first major motion picture created mostly using high-resolution digital videotape rather than film. And while Mr. McCallum is reluctant to declare that the all-digital Jedi warriors will bring death to film, he is confident that the production is just the beginning of a major shift in movies.</p>
        <p>''You have to be pretty brain dead to be involved in film at this time and not realize that we are going through a very serious evolutionary step in how we acquire images,'' he said. If everything goes according to plan, the move by Lucasfilm Ltd. to digital imaging should go unnoticed by theater audiences, who will still view the goings on in ''a galaxy far, far away'' the old-fashioned way with projected film.</p>
        <p>But those results will be closely scrutinized within the film world, where the decision by Lucasfilm has sparked an intense debate. Steven Poster, a director of photography and vice president of the American Society of Cinematographers, said he thought the technology still wasn't good enough for the big screen. For one thing, digital images contain somewhat less detail than traditional film images. ''We've seen through Imax how audiences are just thrilled with a big, more visceral experience,'' he said, referring to the jumbo-screen, film-based movie technology. ''There is a very positive use of this digital technology in television. But when it comes to motion pictures, we're adopting a technology that hasn't been audience tested. If you start with less of an image, you wind up with an even lesser image on screen.''</p>
        <p>Even without digital cameras, the ''Star Wars'' films have increasingly become products of digital imaging. For example, nearly all of the 2,200 shots in ''Episode I: The Phantom Menace'' were scanned into a computer for editing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lucas had decided to use fully digital cameras in 1997, after viewing demonstrations of high-definition digital systems that Sony designed for television. Officers at Sony in Japan had contemplated a similar digital system for the big screen, ''there were sections of the company that weren't entirely sure that there would be a marketplace of any size,'' said Laurence Thorpe, vice president for acquisition systems at Sony Electronics' broadcast and professional products group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lucas told Sony that if the company created a digital system for theatrical films, he would use it to make ''Phantom Menace.'' ''He was the nudging factor,'' Mr. Thorpe said. ''Having a luminary give us encouragement spurred us into action.''</p>
        <p>The new equipment was called the Sony Digital Film System, but that name is slightly misleading. The system actually uses videotape cassettes, slightly smaller than VHS tapes. The camera captures an image with its lens then passes it through a prism that breaks it down in red, green or blue light. Three light-sensitive digital chips then analyze the image, and the data is converted into digital form and recorded on the tape (although, in theory, the data could be stored on any digital recording media, like a hard drive, for example). Once on tape, the images are transferred to the hard drives of specialized computers for editing and special effects. When all the post-production is finished, special laser printers expose the image onto photographic film used to generate prints for theater projectors.</p>
        <p>Creating a digital system for movies was not a straightforward proposition. To start with, Sony had to design its system to operate at 24 frames per second -- the rate of movie theater projectors -- rather than the 60 frames per second used in television. In addition to the cameras, that re-engineering project involved a whole range of equipment needed to edit, adjust and manipulate the images.</p>
        <p>Because it was probable that future productions would still mix in conventional film with digital images, Sony -- working with Mr. Lucas's film effects company, Industrial Light and Magic -- also had to write software to make the digital images match the appearance of various types of film.</p>
        <p>Sony's greatest shortcoming, however, was not electronic but mechanical. The new motion picture system (now known as 24P) was based on the design of a camera, intended for television news crews, that outwardly looks little different from the Betacams made by the company since the 1980's. Not only were its viewfinder system and controls unsuitable for feature film crews, but the weight of film production lenses was enough to rip the front off the camera. None of those lenses could be used in any case. Because the camera's light-sensitive charged coupled device is smaller than the format used for 35-millimeter films, exceptionally precise optics had to be developed.</p>
        <p>The delays meant that the new camera would not be ready for ''Phantom Menace.'' To solve its mechanical and optical problems, Sony partnered with Panavision, which designs, builds and rents film cameras and lenses. The two companies had collaborated in 1989 on a digital film camera that was unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>In January Panavision delivered the first prototype camera to Lucasfilm and Industrial Light and Magic. For four months, technicians shot a variety of technical tests with conventional film cameras rolling beside the digital upstart.</p>
        <p>The digital images were then converted to 35-millimeter film using three techniques: a Sony laser printer that writes directly onto film, an in-house process developed by Industrial Light and Magic and a laser printer made by E-Films, a Los Angeles-based company. The conventional film was also put through all the steps it would encounter during actual production.</p>
        <p>The results were shipped back to Mr. Lucas for side-by-side projections at the Skywalker Ranch's private theater in Marin County, Calif. On March 10, Mr. Lucas blessed the digital results despite having some misgivings about the camera design. Mr. Thorpe recalled his saying: ''I'll accept the physical limitations of the camera, as you've got to start somewhere. I hope you'll listen to me when you design your next generation of camera.''</p>
        <p>There are several kinds of scenes that will still require film cameras in ''Episode II'' because the Sony system in its current form will operate only at 24 frames per second. Most of the trademark ''Star Wars'' light-sabre battle scenes are shot with the camera running more slowly than normal to make the action appear faster and presumably more swashbuckling when projected on the screen. Stop-action animation (the frame-by-frame manipulation of three-dimensional models to simulate movement) is also impossible with the digital system.</p>
        <p>But the digital system has some significant advantages. For ''Episode I,'' Mr. McCallum estimated that it cost upward of $1.7 million to buy, process and transfer film to digital tape for post-production and special effects. For ''Episode II,'' he is budgeting $15,000 for tapes. Similarly, a film camera races through a standard 1,000-foot film magazine in 11 minutes. Each digital tape can store up to 50 minutes of images. And fewer production steps could mean less deterioration in image quality. ''Film is alchemy,'' Mr. McCallum said. ''Every time a print is made, the quality is less and less.''</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Lucas's endorsement, both Sony and Panavision emphasize that the digital system is still a work in progress. ''The fact that someone like George Lucas has made such a strong commitment to this technology gives it credibility it would otherwise have to earn,'' said John Galt, Panavision's senior vice president for advanced digital imaging. ''But I'm still of the opinion that we have to prove that it works.''</p>
        <p>But whether that will improve the quality of what moviegoers see at the local multiplex is still an open question. Mr. McCallum said: ''Digital is just a tool. It doesn't mean that films are going to get any better.''</p>
