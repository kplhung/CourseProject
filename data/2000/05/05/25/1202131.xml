        <p>THE young man, whose dapper mustache and cream-colored Prada raincoat proclaimed him to be a seeker of the most up-to-the-minute design truths, was transfixed. ''It's so exciting,'' said David Kimelman, 22, a student at Pratt Institute. ''This is design based almost purely on body language. The paint job is so beautiful, but the gestures are what's really cool.''</p>
        <p>He wasn't talking about any of the new furniture being introduced this week at the International Contemporary Furniture Fair, or the experiments in techno-gel, felt or polyester open cell foam on show there. He was enthusiastic about a breakthrough of a different order: 18th-century porcelain figurines.</p>
        <p>Dozens of eight-inch figures elaborately costumed in gold-trimmed waistcoats, floral dirndls and other exotic garb and flashing coy, dimpled glances, mock surprise or drawn daggers were capering on the tables at Moss, the SoHo design shop and purveyor of avant-garde modernism. ''I was definitely taken aback when I first saw them,'' Mr. Kimelman said. ''That was the best part.''</p>
        <p>In a gesture that could be interpreted as either the last straw for minimalism or an inspired embrace of refined product design, Murray Moss spread out several hundred pieces of porcelain, which were conceived in the 18th century at the Nymphenburg factory in Bavaria and remain in production. The pairing itself was provocative: Mr. Moss, the high priest of modernist retailing, dressed as always to code in solid black and white (''I haven't worn a pattern in years and years!''), and those exquisitely high-priced rococo knickknacks favored by German aristocrats for 250 years.</p>
        <p>On Monday night, about 200 design fans  arrived at the opening of Mr. Moss's paean to porcelain, ''White Gold, a Fragile Eccentricity.'' The exhibition, which also features contemporary works in porcelain by Ted Muehling and Konstantin Grcic, will be on display through Sunday. Mr. Muehling's Nymphenburg collection is on display at Bergdorf Goodman, and the work of another designer, Bodo Sperlein, from Germany, is being featured at Breukelen at 68 Gansevoort Street in Greenwich Village. But only Mr. Moss is showcasing the classic figurines.</p>
        <p>''I surprise myself by liking them,'' said Robert LaValva, 36, an architect, peering at a mincing masked harlequin figurine robed in orange and yellow striped pajamas overlaid with black and blue diamonds. ''They're so well crafted, so clearly from another era,  but also so timeless. The intense colors remind me of the Sistine Chapel after it was cleaned.'' First produced in 1747, Nymphenburg porcelains are not as famous or as collectible as those from Meissen, an older and larger porcelain works in Germany. But from the start, Nymphenburg's figurines, plates and table services have been laboriously handmade, some pieces taking six weeks to complete. Each ribboned bow is added with tweezers; each colored glaze is fired separately at a different temperature.</p>
        <p>The Nymphenburg Porcelain Factory can claim one of the greatest porcelain artists ever to have worked the complex mixture of china clay, quartz and feldspar known as white gold: Franz Anton Bustelli. He made porcelains for only eight years, until his death in 1763, but it is his creations (in reproduction) that are being celebrated at Moss.</p>
        <p>''He was Nymphenburg's key modeler,'' said Jody Wilkie, head of European ceramics and glass at Christie's. ''His figures are wonderfully alive. There's a very distinctive elegance and sophistication to Bustelli pieces. Once you've seen one, they pop out at you as different from anything else.''</p>
        <p>Still, $75,000 Bustelli originals and $2,900 newly painted porcelain plates are not an easy sell in these days of mass production and low, low price points. Besides, collecting figurines is for ''a rather old-fashioned taste,'' as Ms. Wilkie put it. ''Every time I organize a sale I wonder, Who am I going to find to buy this stuff?'' she added, noting that 18th-century pieces rarely come on the market.</p>
        <p>Three years ago, when Egbert Freiherr von Maltzahn took over as president of the  factory, he set out to woo a younger crowd. ''We can't live anymore off the old aristocracy,'' he said, sipping a glass of Champagne at the Moss opening. ''We have to find more customers, like Gucci did.'' To that end, he started commissioning young designers, like Mr. Muehling of New York and Mr. Grcic of Munich, to make their own designs at the factory, which is on the grounds of the 17th-century Nymphenburg Palace.</p>
        <p>''I was shocked to see that these remarkably graceful things were still in production,'' Mr. Muehling said. ''The part that isn't kitschy'' is extraordinary, he added.</p>
        <p>After almost two years of learning, among other things, how to shape a single egg that wouldn't collapse when baked at 2,500 degrees, Mr. Muehling has brought forth a 17-piece porcelain collection with near-transparent shell-shaped dishes, spoons that look like bleached, porous coral and blue oval vases so like eggs that they might fool a robin in spring. (They're available for $70 to $700).</p>
        <p>Nymphenburg's interest in such designers dovetails nicely with a new generation discovering the handmade. Marcel Wanders, the Dutch designer often associated with Droog, the hypermodern design collaborative, said he wants to start working at Nymphenburg soon. He blanched, however, when asked about the inherent conflict between a royal factory created to serve the king's court and modernism's high-tech, available-to-all agenda. Don't they cancel each other out?</p>
        <p>''That's not coming from our generation!'' he said. ''Our generation wants to do the full gamut, from plastic to handmade porcelain.''</p>
        <p>As designers raised on injection-molded plastics start exploring the incandescent beauty of things handmade, Mr. Moss is at the ready to be their bald John Ruskin, the 19th-century aesthetician who glorified English crafts.</p>
        <p>''What I miss in today's object culture is narrative, things that have a story to tell,'' Mr. Moss said, as he showed a guest a back room where his stock of Nymphenburg porcelains (white plates, $91; commedia dell'arte figurine with ornately painted bodice and skirt, $23,000) are stored draped in notes saying, ''Do not touch, or die!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Moss explained his newfound passion for the porcelains: ''I reached a point where I have things around me with no surface decoration, no emotional qualities. It's all indestructible stainless steel, carbon-fiber, techno-materials. I'm looking for things with more humanity, things that are fragile and not so replaceable. Why not have some things that if they broke you would feel a personal loss? Why not own something that you love and that if it weren't there you would be sad? We do it with people -- why not with an object?''</p>
        <p>Mr. von Maltzahn would be content to see his company's stagnant sales climb. As the crowd threatened to overwhelm the plates spread out as they once were for royalty along a long white lacquered table at the center of Moss, the president of the Nymphenburg porcelain factory remained sanguine. No matter that a figurine or a plate, painted by an artisan free to express a flower or bee slightly differently from the last, might not make it through the night.</p>
        <p>''If anything breaks, it's O.K.,'' Mr. von Maltzahn said. ''They're insured.''</p>
