        <p>This 30-second commercial, titled ''Families,'' is one of three released yesterday by former Gov. Jim Florio in his campaign against Jon S. Corzine for the Democratic nomination for the Senate from New Jersey. It began running yesterday on television stations in New York City and Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- The Campaign Group.</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN -- The commercial begins with a close-up of Mr. Corzine from one of his own advertisements, talking about requiring employers to provide health care for their workers. But the picture freezes, shrinks and twists away to reveal the words, ''The truth on Jon Corzine.'' Newspaper headlines follow: ''Corzine in role of slippery pol,'' an editorial from The Trentonian. An article from The New York Times, headlined ''Corzine's Ties to Goldman Sachs Could Become a Political Liability,'' is juxtaposed against the words, ''Corzine: No Health Care for Employees.'' Mr. Corzine is then shown briefly, walking, in a series of black-and-white still photos, over another headline: ''No business being a senator,'' the title of a column that ran in Crain's New York Business. The pictures of Mr. Corzine fade away, replaced by the assertion, ''Corzine's firm raided a billion dollars from an employees pension plan.'' Next, against a white background: ''New Jersey's families need a senator who will stand up and fight for us.'' Finally, against a black background: ''Not Jon Corzine.''</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT -- Narrator: ''Hold it, Mr. Corzine. Tell New Jersey's families the truth about your record. While saying he's for universal health care, Corzine forgot to tell us that when he ran his own company, he didn't provide health care for many of his employees. Corzine's own firm was forced to pay millions of dollars for raiding a billion dollars from an employees' pension plan. That's our money. Pretty sleazy, huh? New Jersey's families need a senator who will stand up and fight for us. Not Jon Corzine.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY -- The newspaper headlines are used somewhat misleadingly. The headlines from The Trentonian and Crain's are displayed without saying where they were published or that they were opinion pieces. And the Times article shown in the ad actually said nothing about health care, so the juxtaposition of the article with an assertion about health benefits provided by Mr. Corzine's company is disingenuous at best. Mr. Corzine says that his former firm, Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, provided above-average health benefits for all of its full-time workers, who made up 90 percent of its staff. In 1995, Goldman, Sachs paid $253 million to settle a lawsuit charging that the firm had conspired with Robert Maxwell, the late publisher, to defraud pensioners.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD -- With this ad and two others, Mr. Florio's financially disadvantaged campaign finally begins to blast away at Mr. Corzine, who has all but saturated the airwaves for the last 10 weeks. The ad tries to compensate for that imbalance by attempting, judo-like, to turn Mr. Corzine's slick commercials against him. Notably, the commercial does not mention Mr. Florio's name once.</p>
