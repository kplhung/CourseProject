        <p>Era of the El  While a new Second Avenue subway remains something of a futuristic dream, the Museum of the City of New York is looking back to the days when streets glutted with traffic -- horsecars, coaches and pedestrians -- induced planners to look heavenward for a solution. They found it in the elevated train. In 1867 Charles Henry began work on the city's first quarter-mile of elevated track on Greenwich Street. By 1876 the Ninth Avenue El covered five miles from downtown to 53rd Street in Manhattan. Not far behind were the Third Avenue El, the Sixth Avenue line and the Second Avenue Elevated. In ''Under the El,'' from Saturday through Dec. 3, the museum draws on its collection of prints and drawings of neighborhood life in the era of the elevated train.</p>

        <p>Era of the El  While a new Second Avenue subway remains something of a futuristic dream, the Museum of the City of New York is looking back to the days when streets glutted with traffic -- horsecars, coaches and pedestrians -- induced planners to look heavenward for a solution. They found it in the elevated train. In 1867 Charles Henry began work on the city's first quarter-mile of elevated track on Greenwich Street. By 1876 the Ninth Avenue El covered five miles from downtown to 53rd Street in Manhattan. Not far behind were the Third Avenue El, the Sixth Avenue line and the Second Avenue Elevated. In ''Under the El,'' from Saturday through Dec. 3, the museum draws on its collection of prints and drawings of neighborhood life in the era of the elevated train.</p>
        <p>Picture Weaving  More than 200 works created between 1924 and 1978 will go on view on Sunday when the Jewish Museum begins the first comprehensive exhibition in New York devoted to the Berlin-born, Bauhaus-trained textile designer Anni Albers. Featured in this survey of her textiles and graphic art are 25 of the artist's wall hangings and weavings. A separate room is devoted to her largest and possibly most significant work, ''Six Prayers,'' a Holocaust memorial. ''Anni Albers,'' including prints, drawings, jewelry, photographs and memorabilia about her life and marriage to the painter Josef Albers, runs through Aug. 20.</p>
        <p>In the Beginning  Question: What's new in town? Answer: the Latino Cultural Series at Queens Theater in the Park, situated in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park. The series begins this weekend, with performances tomorrow and Saturday at 7 and 10 p.m. and on Sunday at 4 and 7 p.m. by the Colombian skit comedy troupe Tola y Maruja. At 1 p.m. Sunday a free performance will be given by Images and Traditions Children's Dance Group, whose members, 6 to 15 years old, will offer traditional and popular dances from various regions and states of Mexico.</p>
        <p>Fleet of Feet  Who's that tap-tap-tapping at Town Hall? At 7 p.m. on Sunday, to the music of the Frank Owens Trio, it will be people and troupes like Jimmy Slyde, Dianne Walker, Mable Lee, the Flintstone Hoofers and the Silver Belles. And if tradition is any guide, probably Savion Glover, Leonard Reed and Buster Brown. The event is Tap Extravaganza 2000, a production of the New York Committee to Celebrate National Tap Dance Day, which was designated by an act of Congress in 1989. Mr. Glover, 26, and Leonard Reed, 92, are to receive Flo-Bert Awards, given to those who have advanced the artistry of tap through performance, teaching and choreography. And Buster Brown, 87, will receive the Peg Leg Bates Award for leadership in dance.</p>
