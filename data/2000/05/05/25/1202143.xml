        <p>Metallica and others in the record industry may complain that unauthorized exchange of music files on the Internet is killing their business, but the numbers have yet to bear that out. In 1998, only one artist had ever sold more than a million copies of a record in its first week on sale: Garth Brooks. But in the last year teeny-bopper pop acts have been shattering his record. First, the Backstreet Boys sold 1.1 million copies of their second album, ''Millenium''; then 'N Sync sold a staggering 2.4 million copies of its second album, ''No Strings Attached.'' And this week, Britney Spears, one of the most widely traded artists on Internet sites, has broken a million with her second album, ''Oops! . . . I Did It Again'' (Jive).</p>
        <p>According to Soundscan, a media-sales monitoring company in Hartsdale, N.Y., ''Oops!'' sold 1.3 million copies in its first week to reach the No. 1 position.

        <p>Metallica and others in the record industry may complain that unauthorized exchange of music files on the Internet is killing their business, but the numbers have yet to bear that out. In 1998, only one artist had ever sold more than a million copies of a record in its first week on sale: Garth Brooks. But in the last year teeny-bopper pop acts have been shattering his record. First, the Backstreet Boys sold 1.1 million copies of their second album, ''Millenium''; then 'N Sync sold a staggering 2.4 million copies of its second album, ''No Strings Attached.'' And this week, Britney Spears, one of the most widely traded artists on Internet sites, has broken a million with her second album, ''Oops! . . . I Did It Again'' (Jive).</p>
        <p>According to Soundscan, a media-sales monitoring company in Hartsdale, N.Y., ''Oops!'' sold 1.3 million copies in its first week to reach the No. 1 position. It is the second-highest first-week sales total for an album since Soundscan began tracking sales in the 80's, bested only by 'N Sync.</p>
        <p>The Soundscan report, released yesterday, also indicated that while other teen-pop sensations have been setting new records with their sophomore albums, Hanson had another awful week with its second album of new material, ''This Time Around'' (Mercury). Released earlier this month, the record sold 64,000 copies in its first week to reach No. 16 on the pop charts; now, in its second week, it has slipped all the way to No. 72, with sales of 20,000 copies. Worsening this sophomore slump for the sibling trio, music executives say, the concert-business monolith SFX/ Clear Channel has withdrawn its support from the band's planned summer tour, leaving Hanson without an effective means of promoting its new album. (Christopher Sabec, the band's manager, said that the tour had not been canceled and that the group was still in discussions with several concert promoters, including SFX.)</p>
        <p>There is a lesson to learn from Ms. Spears's success and Hanson's disappointment. Ms. Spears followed her debut album with ''Oops!'' in just a little over a year. Hanson took three years to release a proper follow-up, and three years is all it takes for a teeny-bopper to go through puberty and start listening to Kid Rock instead of boy pop. Even Hanson changed in those three years, moving from sunny harmonies to more driving rock, which in itself may be another reason for the album's lackluster sales.</p>
        <p>Hanson and its label, Mercury, had made a conscious decision not to record a second album right away. Instead, they prolonged the success of their first album, ''Middle of Nowhere,'' for as long as possible with tours, concert videos and three albums of filler: a Christmas record, a live release and a collection of early demos. After wading through three mediocre albums hoping for a glimmer of the pop epiphany that was ''Middle of Nowhere,'' fans may have been tapped out, especially considering that Hanson's latest album had no strong, omnipresent single generating advance excitement.</p>
        <p>''I'm still trying to figure why the first single didn't perform at Top 40 radio,'' said Mr. Sabec, who has now pinned his hopes on a second single, ''If Only,'' which he described as a poppier summer song.</p>
        <p>To those who have worked with the band, Hanson's musicians are of a higher caliber, greater talent and purer intention than many of the teeny-bopper acts it gets lumped with, but to most music consumers it is  one pop trend behind the time. Hanson belongs to the era of the Spice Girls, who have yet to release a second album and whose solo efforts have been consistent flops.</p>
        <p>Its replacement models -- 'N Sync, Britney Spears -- have been designed with a slicker grade of plastic. Where Hanson once worried about looking too packaged and corporate, alongside these acts it now looks more backdated and independent.</p>
        <p>If one takes a step back and looks at the rest of this week's music-group news, the situation looks bad for ugly, unpredictable rock 'n' roll: one of the most popular American rock bands of the 90's, the Smashing Pumpkins, announced that it would break up after its current tour, while Noel Gallagher of the biggest British rock band of the 90's, Oasis, walked out on the group mid-tour.</p>
        <p>In the big picture, one sees 90's rock egos imploding under the pressure of retreating success while Ms. Spears lip-synchs her way to the pop summit by trying to please everybody: singing that she's ''not so innocent,'' covering ''Satisfaction'' by the Rolling Stones, and, at the same time, trumpeting a claim of chastity.</p>
        <p>But where some see a long-term trend of younger music consumers increasingly dominating a marketplace flooded with bubblegum that quickly loses its flavor, others see pop music as a cycle.</p>
        <p>To use the terminology of one radio consultant, pop music currently is in the doldrums, where blandness is king. But coming up next, according to this theory, is the exact opposite, when alienated music fans embrace something loud and ugly, which this time around may be such an extreme reaction that fans will be pining for the safe, predictable days when Britney Spears couldn't get no satisfaction.</p>
