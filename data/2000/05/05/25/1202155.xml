        <p>When Roberto Benigni's ''Life Is Beautiful'' won an Oscar for best foreign film in 1999, many hoped that his success signaled a renaissance of Italian cinema after years of slump and slumber.</p>
        <p>It didn't.</p>
        <p>This year not a single Italian film was selected in the main competition at the Cannes Film Festival, a rebuff that stirred outrage, despair and passionate hand-wringing here. Yet even in Italy domestic films are in decline, selling only a little more than half as many tickets this year as they did last year. Thirty-five years ago, Italy produced almost 300 films annually. Now, the figure is about 100. One in five doesn't find a distributor, and many of the others are moved out of theaters after a few days to make way for American blockbusters.</p>
        <p>Italians are talking again, as they have been off and on for 30 years, about the ''crisis'' of cinema, a word usually reserved for falling governments and train strikes.</p>
        <p>But there is a slight difference this time. For years film lovers have bemoaned the absence of a new generation of filmmakers who could match the great postwar Italian directors, Fellini, De Sica, Pasolini, Visconti and Rossellini. Yet in a culture where even untested directors are reverently treated as ''autori'' and given free rein (as well as government loans and grants), filmmakers and critics are beginning to lament the lack of shrewd, tough-minded producers who can discipline screenwriters and coax a commercial hit from a director's inchoate vision.</p>
        <p>The late Franco Cristaldi, a producer who is perhaps best known in the United States as a former husband of Claudia Cardinale, is revered in Italy as a film impresario who, among other things, trimmed Giuseppe Tornatore's ''Cinema Paradiso'' by 47 minutes, which helped it win an Oscar for best foreign film in 1990. ''It is really sad; there are no Cristaldis today,'' said Deborah Young, a film critic for Variety who is based here. Ms. Young, a veteran of Italian film festivals, explained, ''You see the same problems over and over, the lack of script supervision and executive control.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tornatore is still making films, but his latest, ''Malena,'' is being financed and produced by Miramax, a business arrangement that may signal the studio's interest in Italian films but also underlines the absence of strong financial and executive support in Mr. Tornatore's homeland.</p>
        <p>Not that the relationship between American producers and Italian directors is always easy. Harvey Weinstein, the co-chairman of Miramax, recently told Italian reporters that he found Mr. Tornatore headstrong and joked that he doubted they would ever work together again.</p>
        <p>Italian filmmakers once scorned the commercialism and pandering of Hollywood movies. Now younger Italians are complaining about the self-indulgent and unbusinesslike atmosphere surrounding moviemaking Italian-style. ''Film in Italy is still seen as an art form, not a commercial product,'' said Marco Pugini, whose film company, Panorama, makes international productions. ''The market is driven by authors who write their own scripts, and it is hard for the producer to say, 'Sorry, the script isn't working.' ''</p>
        <p>Last year the Italian government gave filmmakers $60 million in loans and grants. The handout is less generous than French subsidies, and many film reviewers say their government should do more.</p>
        <p>Producers like Mr. Pugini, however, argue that state subsidies are a crutch that helps directors avoid the realities of the market.</p>
        <p>Even with government grants, Italian film budgets are small, averaging about $2 million a picture. The result is that Italian film is mostly restricted to two forms: low-budget art films, mostly morose coming-of-age-in-the-provinces tales, and big budget, hugely successful ribald comedies that make ''Dumb and Dumber'' seem smart.</p>
        <p>Christian De Sica, the son of Vittorio De Sica, is the king of the latter genre, an actor and director whose most recent film, ''Christmas Holidays 2000,'' in which he played his usual role, an antic, hollering husband with a roving eye, was one of the year's 10 top grossing films. He is among those who felt affronted by the Cannes Film Festival's rejection.</p>
        <p>''The Cannes decision made me angry,'' he said. ''As if the French didn't also make a lot of stupid movies.''</p>
        <p>He conceded, however, that Italian cinema was in a slump: ''Thank God my films are a big success, but there is a crisis. There is no Fellini, De Sica, Rossellini anymore.'' He complained that Italians do not revere their own cinematic history, relying on Americans like Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg to restore and preserve the postwar masterpieces.</p>
        <p>Mr. De Sica and his brother, Manuel, alarmed purists when they restored their father's film ''Miracle in Milan.'' In the original, famous final scene when all the characters fly over Milan on broomsticks, the nylon strings holding up the actors are faintly visible. De Sica's children decided to airbrush the strings, wiping out one of film buffs' beloved production errors.</p>
        <p>''At home, my father always complained about those strings,'' Mr. De Sica explained.</p>
        <p>The Cecchi Gori Group is one of Italy's biggest movie companies, an empire that produces or distributes 30 percent of Italian films and owns 70 screens in 45 theaters. It was founded in 1957 by Mario Cecchi Gori, a legendary producer who helped bring ''Mediterraneo'' to the screen and wrote screenplays. The company is now run by his son Vittorio Cecchi Gori, a senator who, in an echo of the media tycoon Silvio Berlusconi, combines the movie business with politics and also owns Fiorentina, a Florence soccer team.</p>
        <p>His television stations are less profitable than the state channels or Mr. Berlusconi's dominant networks, and the company has run into cash flow trouble, creating payment disputes with MGM and Miramax. (Mr. Cecchi Gori said that those ''misunderstandings'' had been resolved.) The Senator, as his aides call him, is a flamboyant figure, a voluble, staccato speaker who looks like a young, tanned Rodney Dangerfield and lives in a sumptuous Renaissance palace built for the Borghese family.</p>
        <p>Insiders do not view Mr. Cecchi Gori as the hands-on producer his father was, however. It is his wife, Rita Rusic, from whom Mr. Cecchi Gori is now separated, who is credited with producing the films of Leonardo Pieraccioni, silly farces that in Italy have outsold many of Mr. Benigni's most popular comedies.</p>
        <p>The company distributed Mr. Benigni's ''Life Is Beautiful'' domestically, and it became Italy's top money-making film, outselling Bertolucci's ''Last Tango in Paris'' and Sergio Leone's ''For a Few Dollars More.'' But Mr. Benigni produced the film himself, and worldwide distribution was taken over by Miramax, which insisted on deep cuts in the first half to shape it more to international tastes -- and the Oscars.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cecchi Gori was asked in an interview why Italian cinema was in a slump. ''Because 30 percent of Italian moviegoers go in without paying,'' he replied. ''I personally verified the receipts at one of our theaters last summer; there were 2,000 people there, and 400 didn't pay.''</p>
        <p>This year a few Italian films veered from the pattern and did well at the Italian box office, which is dominated by American blockbusters like ''Runaway Bride'' and ''Mission to Mars.'' One was ''Pane e Tupilani'' (''Bread and Tulips''), a slight romantic comedy directed by Silvio Soldini about a housewife who goes to Venice on a lark to escape her dreary life in Pescara. It was rejected by Cannes but was shown there out of competition. Last month it won nine David di Donatello awards, Italy's version of the Oscars.</p>
        <p>Another, ''Canone Inverso,'' a Cecchi Gori film directed by Ricky Tognazzi, son of the famous comic actor Ugo Tognazzi, is a more ambitious, international co-production, a sprawling love story of Czech violinists caught in World War II. Neither film can be called a masterpiece, but the two are viewed by Italian filmmakers as encouraging departures from the usual mediocre fare.</p>
        <p>'' 'Pane e Tulipani' is the best we have right now, but in an earlier time, it would have been seen as middling, certainly not excellent,'' said Filice Laudadio, president of Cinecitta Holding, Italy's best-known studio.</p>
        <p>'' 'Canone Inverso' is not a great film, but it is interesting within the Italian context,'' he added. ''For one thing, it is not about Ricky Tognazzi, and that is already important.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Laudadio, who has served as director of the Venice Film Festival and many others, said that Italians, having been spoon-fed silly comedies, had lost their taste for difficult, troubling movies. He cited the commercial failure of ''Garage Olimpo,'' a critically praised film by Marco Bechis, who is half Italian, half Argentine. The film addresses police torture in Argentina.</p>
        <p>Mr. Laudadio said that screenwriting was an ailing craft in Italy. In 1985 he established the Solinas Prize, named after Franco Solinas, the late screenwriter. But he conceded that the prize had done little to stimulate better scripts.</p>
        <p>He also blamed television. ''It lowers the level of all films and flattens the imagination of filmmakers and audiences,'' he said. In Italy, many films are jointly produced with state television or are presold to networks to secure financing, which further narrows the vision of directors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Laudadio was not optimistic that the current slump would eventually force Italian directors and screenwriters to produce better films. ''The outlook isn't so bad from a commercial point of view, and there are some great films, like 'Garage Olimpo,' '' he said, adding, ''We still have to hit rock bottom.''</p>
