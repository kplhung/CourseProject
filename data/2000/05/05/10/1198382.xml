        <p>Undaunted by the slim odds of last night's draw, people in several states rushed to join a ticket-buying frenzy for the largest potential jackpot in the history of lotteries: $350 million.</p>
        <p>The chances of hitting a winning ticket for the seven-state lottery called The Big Game, which is sold in Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey and Virginia, were one in 76 million, said Tandi Reddick, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Lottery Corporation.</p>

        <p>Undaunted by the slim odds of last night's draw, people in several states rushed to join a ticket-buying frenzy for the largest potential jackpot in the history of lotteries: $350 million.</p>
        <p>The chances of hitting a winning ticket for the seven-state lottery called The Big Game, which is sold in Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Jersey and Virginia, were one in 76 million, said Tandi Reddick, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Lottery Corporation.</p>
        <p>But that did not slow people intent on a chance at the jackpot. In the Northeast, New Yorkers flocked over the bridges and through the tunnels to New Jersey yesterday, to buy the $1 tickets in anticipation of last night's drawing.</p>
        <p>Others relied on colleagues, friends and family members from New Jersey to give them a shot at the prize. Justin M. Turner, a senior associate at the accounting firm of PriceWaterhouseCoopers LLP, put in $5 and joined an office pool of about 40 tickets, bought by a colleague from New Jersey.</p>
        <p>''Your odds increase when you're in a pool, even though it is still about a zillion to one that we will pick the right numbers,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And scalpers took up a big game of their own, selling tickets at inflated prices yesterday outside the Port Authority Bus Terminal at 42nd Street and Eighth Avenue. One man selling tickets there with two friends, and who declined to give his name, said, ''They're selling them everywhere, they're selling them in front of your building, they're just smooth about it.''</p>
        <p>Police officials said yesterday they were not aware of widespread scalping problems.</p>
        <p>The drawing took place last night at 11 p.m. at the WSB-TV studios in Atlanta; the winning numbers were 1, 2, 12, 33, 37 and Big Ball 4.  No announcement of any possible winners was expected to be made until 6 this morning.</p>
        <p>The total jackpot, going to just one person, would pay, after taxes, either $8.9 million a year for 26 years, or a lump sum of $114 million.</p>
        <p>The enormity of these numbers drew a steady stream of ticket buyers at a Krauszer's Food Store in West Orange, N.J., yesterday. The buyers said that the prospect of winning, while remote, was too remarkable to pass up.</p>
        <p>And even if they were underwhelmed by their own prospects, hope sprang eternal for their relatives and friends across the country.</p>
        <p>Bill Foster, a computer consultant from West Orange, was there yesterday buying tickets for himself and his brother in Florida -- 60 in total.</p>
        <p>Last night's prize had been growing since March 3, when one winning ticket purchased in Massachusetts brought in a jackpot of $18 million. Previously, the largest American jackpot was $295.7 million, drawn in a Powerball lottery by 13 machinists in Westerville, Ohio, in 1998.</p>
        <p>In raw numbers, only one jackpot worldwide has been larger than the one drawn yesterday. In December, a lottery in Spain called El Gordo, or the Fat One, reached $1.2 billion. But that sum was broken up into thousands of prizes, spreading the individual winnings thinner.</p>
