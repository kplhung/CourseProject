        <p>Investors who missed out on the biggest-ever United States initial stock offering last month need not worry or hurry. Shares of AT&amp;T Wireless Group are back down to their offering price and, judging by yesterday's trading pattern, they may not be heading back up again any time soon.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the shares -- which track the performance of AT&amp;T's wireless telecommunications business -- closed at $29.50, unchanged from Monday. Since dipping below the offering price briefly on Monday, the shares have rarely strayed from that level.</p>
        <p>The nearly flat line on the wireless unit's stock chart resulted from a strong show of support from the investment banks that underwrote the $10.6 billion offering. In general, it is considered bad form on Wall Street to allow a client's first-time stock offering to quickly fall below its initial price without putting up a fight.</p>
        <p>But traders say it is not clear how much longer the price of AT&amp;T Wireless will hold steady because there are no concrete rules on how far underwriters must go in providing support against selling pressure. In after-hours trading, the stock fell to $29.</p>
        <p>Traders at a few big investment banks said that Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, one of three lead underwriters, was buying a lot of stock back at the offering price yesterday on behalf of the syndicate of underwriters, which included almost every major investment bank.</p>
        <p>More than 12 million shares of AT&amp;T Wireless changed hands yesterday for a total of about $360 million. Goldman, Sachs officials declined to say how much of that buying the firm did or to discuss why the firm was buying back the stock.</p>
        <p>But traders and investment bankers at other firms said Goldman clearly felt obligated to prop up the stock because it was such a lucrative, high-profile deal and because AT&amp;T wields such influence on Wall Street. A lesser deal that had performed early on as AT&amp;T Wireless has done probably would not have received as much support, they said. The wireless stock rose as high as $36, a gain of more than 20 percent, in its first few days of trading before it began to sink.</p>
        <p>To land the role of lead underwriter, investment banks often pledge to use their own capital to keep stocks at or above their offering prices. Most prospectuses explain that the underwriters may purchase shares in the open market to stabilize the stock price ''above independent market levels.'' Underwriters also establish what they call penalty bids, parameters set to discourage individual investors from reselling, or ''flipping'' shares.</p>
        <p>''There was a fair amount of syndicate stabilization,'' said a telecommunications stock trader at one Wall Street firm who like several of his peers insisted on not being identified. He said that there were no concrete rules on what banks must do to stabilize a new issue, but that syndicates usually disbanded once a new stock appeared stable at a particular price.</p>
        <p>''Well, if they stop supporting it, it goes to $25, right?'' said the manager of a large mutual fund that owns shares of AT&amp;T wireless, on condition of anonymity. ''So maybe it goes to $27. I think it was just priced high to begin with.''</p>
        <p>''If I had a dollar to put into wireless, I'd buy Nextel, or Voicestream or PCS,'' the manager added, referring to the stock symbol for the shares meant to track the Sprint Corporation's wireless unit. ''But I think over the next six months, the AT&amp;T shares can support this level. The stock's not a short, and the company has a good story.''</p>
        <p>Harvey Liu, an analyst at CIBC World Markets, said that some institutional investors were turning their attention to other wireless investments, like Sprint PCS, which recently announced surprisingly strong subscriber growth.</p>
        <p>Before the offering, Mr. Liu said, ''the underwriters were telling investors that this is a name you have to own; now, clients are asking why do I have to own this name?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Liu, one of the few Wall Street analysts who has not been recommending the new AT&amp;T stock, said investors were also concerned about the lukewarm endorsements it received from analysts at some investment banks that were involved in the underwriting.</p>
        <p>An executive close to AT&amp;T said the company was not buying the wireless shares on its own. AT&amp;T's treasury department, however, has traded the company's shares on the open market before, according to people close to the company. While companies generally disclose large plans to repurchase their own shares, a person close to AT&amp;T said yesterday that the company would not have to make an immediate public announcement were it to join the effort to support the wireless shares.</p>
        <p>In fact, the prospectus for the wireless offering refers obliquely to the potential for ''repurchases by AT&amp;T of shares of AT&amp;T Wireless Group tracking stock for the account of the AT&amp;T Wireless Group.''</p>
        <p>An AT&amp;T spokeswoman declined to comment.</p>
