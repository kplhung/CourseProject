        <p>With scores of pinstriped businessmen milling about the hotel ballroom, it looked like any other shareholders meeting.</p>
        <p>Auditors from Arthur Andersen hovered in the background, while stockholders called brokers on mobile phones and scrutinized the figures in the glossy annual report.</p>
        <p>But when the meeting was called to order, the first piece of business was a song. A sheet of lyrics in Arabic was distributed for the few who did not already know the words. Everyone rose, and with swelling emotion sang every verse of ''My Homeland,'' the unofficial Palestinian national anthem.</p>
        <p>''This is our first annual meeting on Palestinian soil, and I tell you it is giving me goose bumps,'' Munib Masri, the dapper chairman of the Palestinian Development and Investment Company, or Padico, the fastest-growing Palestinian business conglomerate, whispered before the assembly began.</p>
        <p>The hotel ballroom opened onto the elegantly reconstructed rear plaza of an Ottoman merchant's villa, which in its century-long life has also served as a school, a hospital, and a tear-gassed battleground between Israeli forces and rock-throwing Palestinian youths. The building, long known to Bethlehemites as the Jasir Palace, has been transformed by Padico into an Intercontinental hotel, the first five-star hotel owned and operated by Palestinians on Palestinian-governed territory.</p>
        <p>''This hotel is not just for this company, but for all of our people,'' Ahmed Qurei, the former Palestine Liberation Organization guerrilla leader better known as Abu Ala, proclaimed to the Padico stockholders. Now the speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council and one of Yasir Arafat's closest confidants, Mr. Qurei joined the board members on the dais and praised Padico for ''imposing its private sector style on the development of Palestine.''</p>
        <p>Evidence of the company's endeavors was everywhere around him. The ubiquitous cell phones operated on a network run by Paltel, a private telecommunications monopoly that is 25 percent owned by Padico. The investors assembled in their new hotel were a cross-section  of the emerging Palestinian business elite, some of whom had traveled from Jordan, the United States and the Persian Gulf. (Padico's biggest stockholder, Prince al-Waleed bin Talal, the Saudi mega-billonaire, who did not show up, is one of the few non-Palestinians.) They have made Padico and Paltel the largest companies on the nascent Palestinian stock exchange -- which itself is one of Padico's several subsidiaries.</p>
        <p>This was perhaps not the Palestine of the future envisioned by either critics or champions of the P.L.O. when the Palestinian National Authority came into being six years ago. But in what Mr. Masri proudly described to shareholders as ''a partnership'' with Mr. Arafat's state-in-waiting, he and his colleagues have turned the autonomous Palestinian territory into the most privatized economy in the Middle East. The phone company, the airline, the new power company, the banking and insurance industry -- all are privately owned, and most have some connection to Padico.</p>
        <p>Despite flat profits, it was been a good year for Padico. Share prices climbed steadily after a stock split. The number of shareholders doubled, to 1,700. New enterprises got under way, ranging from housing projects to factories to a Gaza Strip power plant. But when executives reported on those ventures they stressed not profits and losses but their contribution to the creation of a Palestinian state. And while shareholders quizzed board members on what they saw as the peculiarities of Padico's dividends policy, discussions dealt as much with politics and national aspirations as with finances.</p>
        <p>Mr. Qurei particularly congratulated Padico on its expanding network of industrial parks, noting that they have been built as close as possible to the green line -- the boundary between Israel and the then-Jordanian West Bank before the 1967 war. ''Putting industrial zones on the borders of the green line creates political and economic facts,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Bethlehem Intercontinental, just minutes from Israeli West Jerusalem, is the company's latest showcase. Previous stockholder meetings were held in Amman, Jordan -- in part because of Israeli visa difficulties for some Palestinian investors, and in part because the company did not believe that it had an adequate local site. This was the first chance to show off the new hotel to investors.</p>
        <p>Inside the cool interior plaza, with a new fountain burbling beneath ancient shade trees and waiters serving Middle Eastern sweets, the memory of the Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule seemed almost impossibly distant. But immediately behind the hotel -- within full view of its $200-a-night rooms -- are the rutted roads and ramshackle dwellings of the Ayda refugee camp, long a locus of Palestinian unrest. Just down the street is Rachel's Tomb, a Jewish pilgrimage site heavily guarded by Israeli soldiers in one of their few remaining enclaves in Palestinian-ruled Bethlehem.</p>
        <p>This combustible combination still occasionally erupts into confrontation, sending wafts of pepper spray past the Jasir Palace's sand-blasted stone facade.</p>
        <p>The classic third-world contrast of a deluxe hotel abutting an impoverished neighborhood seems not to faze local residents, for whom the project provided construction jobs, or the Palestinian leadership, who laud it as a symbol of national achievement. A bit behind schedule -- Mr. Arafat once hoped to be host to the pope here -- the partly opened hotel was the scene of a reception last month for Jiang Zemin, the president of China. ''This creates a good impression for Palestine among world leaders,'' Mr. Qurei said.</p>
        <p>The company's next luxury hotel project is a beachfront resort in the Gaza Strip, not normally thought of as a tourist destination. As in Bethlehem, the hotel will rise next to a United Nations-administered Palestinian refugee camp.</p>
        <p>''I hope to welcome you all there in two years,'' Mr. Masri told his shareholders.</p>
