        <p>HALF the romance in New York's cityscape can be found in its bridges. The Brooklyn Bridge has always been the darling of poets and painters, but it was another bridge that seduced one of New York's most passionate suitors. ''The city seen from the Queensboro Bridge is always the city seen for the first time,'' he wrote in ''The Great Gatsby.''</p>
        <p>It takes an outsider to see Manhattan that way. And it's an outsider, Sir Terence Conran, who made good on the theatrical possibilities in the tiled vaults under the bridge. Once the site of a thriving food market, they have been a dead spot since the 1930's, used by the city for a sign-painting shop and later a storage depot.</p>
        <p>Sir Terence's dazzling transformation of the bridge vaults gives New Yorkers their first glimpse of a swaggering new international restaurant style. It's a style whose energy and informality feels American, but that has achieved its most complete expression in London and Paris, transforming the restaurant scenes there. Restaurants like Oxo Tower and Bank in London, and Buddha Bar and Bon in Paris, manage to combine the elements of a bar, nightclub, restaurant and theater. They are places to pose, to see and be seen. The bar can often overshadow the dining room.</p>
        <p>Sir Terence has led the way, seizing on unlikely architectural sites for much-imitated restaurants like Le Pont de la Tour in London and Alcazar in Paris. Designed to the hilt, they tend to be large, bordering on enormous. They are loud, lively and up to the minute. Although sensitive to the architectural details of their sites, they ignore, or transcend, the cultural specifics of the cities they happen to be in. The food often runs second to the design.</p>
        <p>Guastavino's fits the pattern. Named after the father and son team who created the tiled ceilings in the bridge's vaults (as well as the ceilings in the Grand Central Oyster Bar and the abandoned City Hall subway station), the restaurant encourages the eye to linger on the powerful pillars that lead upward to cathedral-like ceilings. The raw, almost brutal granite blocks that make up the caissons of the bridge have been left exposed. Sir Terence has extracted every ounce of drama from his location.</p>
        <p>But the overall design is as sleek and international as the Concorde. A long, low-slung bar on the main level pulls a large Upper East Side crowd -- so large that on Thursdays the restaurant sets up a barrier and allows no one in who does not have a dinner reservation. Guastavino Restaurant, on the first floor, is a 300-seat brasserie, clamorous and casual, with a glorious brasserie-style shellfish display in front of the kitchen.</p>
        <p>Up a curved marble staircase, the more formal and intimate Club Guastavino, which seats 100, hangs over the first floor like a giant balcony, soaking up noise and energy from below, but retaining a swaddled sense of isolation and privilege, enhanced by more luxurious materials and boothlike velvet-upholstered sofas.</p>
        <p>The one discordant note in the design is a rather commercial-looking sculpture, 36 feet tall, hanging against the stone wall near the bar. Made of laminated birch sliced into ribbons, it resembles a giant tangle of box tape.</p>
        <p>Guastavino's two kitchens, which operate independently, are under the direction of Daniel Orr, formerly of La Grenouille. Mr. Orr is feeding a lot of people out there, and considering the number of diners swarming into the two restaurants, he does a more than respectable job.</p>
        <p>The food may not light up the night, but at his best, he sends out well-conceived, well-executed dishes that really can compete with the surroundings. He plays a conservative, sometimes plodding game, but usually a winning one.</p>
        <p>The downstairs menu sticks to straightforward brasserie fare, with a few international additions, like matzo ball soup, a lively but overly vinegared salad of scungilli and hot peppers, and an exceedingly tame Cuban stew of tripe, short ribs and oxtail.</p>
        <p>Prawns, oysters and lobsters from the raw bar fairly crackle with freshness, but I was quite taken with two of the more hefty appetizers, a plate-size portobello mushroom buried under a landslide of melted taleggio cheese, and cabbage stuffed with pancetta and tomato.</p>
        <p>One entree deserved elevation to the upstairs menu, a moist and tender baby chicken sprinkled with walnuts, doused in walnut and sage butter, and surrounded by a sticky reduction sauce. The pig's trotter with horseradish yielded about a quarter-ounce of edible meat, lost in a powerful horseradish sauce, but sweetbread schnitzel turned out to be a pleasant surprise, gently crunchy outside, rich and creamy inside. A good old-fashioned Pavlova leads the list of desserts, followed closely by a sharp, concentrated lemon tart.</p>
        <p>Club Guastavino, upstairs, has two moods. The smaller tables that overlook the first floor feel like ringside seating, with an unobstructed view of the percolating bar scene. Farther away from the glass railing, a quieter, more loungey atmosphere takes over, conducive to watching, in the glass of the building across the street, the reflections of cars crossing the bridge.</p>
        <p>There's a lot of presentation at Club Guastavino. Waiters run over, laden with platters of roasted baby lamb or, one evening, bearing an entire roasted pig. The master of the cheese cart must be paid by the piece, because he pushes his products with the zeal of a Fuller Brush man. Fair warning: it takes fortitude to fend off his solicitations.</p>
        <p>Both the lamb and the pig deserve the fanfare. The pig, in particular, feels almost sinful to eat. The animal itself, for one thing, has a pleasant, friendly look about it. Thoughts of ''Babe'' come to mind unbidden. Then there's the meat, soft as butter, pink as coral, flavorful in that piggy way that makes ''flesh'' seem like the appropriate word.</p>
        <p>Mr. Orr's former masters at La Grenouille would beam in approval at his quenelles, the merest puffs of pike mousse floating lightly in an almost obscenely voluptuous crayfish sauce. The dish was already old-fashioned when the Guastavinos were just starting work on the ceiling, but the old warhorses, handled the right way, can still thrill.</p>
        <p>The rather ordinary shellfish bisque could use some of the intensity of the crayfish sauce, but the humble corn chowder is thick and appealingly sweet, with firm chunks of haddock and spiky nettle leaves.</p>
        <p>Roasted prawns on dandelion leaves are not terribly exciting. Neither are the warm oysters swathed in a sauce of spring onions and Champagne. They are correct, but no more. And the ginger-pepper gelee that comes with the lovely galantine of foie gras is a slight mismatch -- the pale jelly is too delicate to stand up to the meat, and the ginger gives it an unpleasantly bitter tinge.</p>
        <p>Roast quail, another appetizer, scores a direct hit. The little birds, done to a turn, are stuffed with a fluffy black pudding enriched with pine nuts and dates.</p>
        <p>Like the quenelles, pan-roasted veal kidneys with a Cognac and mustard sauce may be a dish as old as the hills, but they march right on the stage and take it over.</p>
        <p>Cote du boeuf, served with a fricassee of spring vegetables, is intended for two and could probably feed four. ''It really does look like Fred Flintstone meat,'' our waiter said, wrapping up a week's worth of protein for me to take home.</p>
        <p>Nicole Plue, formerly at Eleven Madison Park, shows a light, fresh touch with her desserts. Tangerine parfait tastes like a Creamsicle that's come into a lot of money, and her very simple, elegant looking terrine of mango and coconut sorbet manages to be opulent and refreshing at the same time. Chocolate vacherin was more to my taste, with a fine, rich chocolate flavor nicely set off by an inspired, fragrant sabayon made with Earl Grey tea.</p>
        <p>Guastavino's almost begs diners to look everywhere but at their plates, and to talk about everything except the food. It's not so much a restaurant as an opportunity to live, for two or three hours, a certain mood, and a certain sense of style, that suits every time zone and speaks every language.</p>
        <p>Sense of place turns out to be a strange illusion, a stylistic touch. Guastavino's, embedded in the Queensboro Bridge, could touch down tomorrow in London, Paris or Berlin, shake off a mild case of jet lag, and open for business. And the crowds would come.</p>
