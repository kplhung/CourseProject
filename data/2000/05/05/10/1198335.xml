        <p>The crowd in Courtroom 1123 at 100 Centre Street last Wednesday was a classic mixture: a parade of men and women charged with crimes; their friends and relatives; benches of lawyers; a sprinkling of court officials. What made it different was Sabina Jezewski.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jezewski, a young woman in blue jeans with sunglasses on top of her head and a black leather jacket on her lap, was there to watch everyone else and evaluate them.</p>
        <p>Ms. Jezewski liked the performance of the judge, Rena K. Uviller, a soft-voiced woman in glasses, but did have one suggestion. ''She could use the microphone more,'' she said. ''It would be easier to hear her.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jezewski was tougher on another judge she had watched, who she said screamed a lot and repeatedly berated those around her.</p>
        <p>''She really lost her temper,'' Ms. Jezewski remarked. ''I recommended vacation for her. I guess she was tired.''</p>
        <p>Although still in her last year of college, Ms. Jezewski is part of a program run by the Fund for Modern Courts, a nonprofit group. The program is using students at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice to monitor courtrooms. They report to the fund on everything from the rooms' physical condition to how defendants and jurors are treated and whether judges are audible, punctual and unbiased.</p>
        <p>The courts receive some independent oversight of their daily functioning, and the students immerse themselves in the actualities of what they are studying in class.</p>
        <p>''Students can read all the textbooks and listen to all the lectures you want, but being there is so much better,'' said Steven Zeidman, executive director of the Fund for Modern Courts. ''It's a natural fit.''</p>
        <p>Court operations may seem a less compelling matter than deciding guilt or innocence, but court experts say the daily functioning of the courts and how they treat the public actually shape public attitudes about the judicial system more than the decisions.</p>
        <p>''Court decisions are the tip of the iceberg,'' said Roger K. Warren, a retired judge who is president of the National Center for State Courts in Williamsburg, Va. ''The other 90 percent is court administration. A person who feels the process was fair has trust and confidence in the courts, whatever the outcome. The opposite is never true.''</p>
        <p>It is court administration that is the primary focus of the Fund for Modern Courts, which assesses courts based on reports by volunteer monitors and has enlisted Ms. Jezewski and 22 of her classmates. The court system is also a partner in the student monitoring project and has dispatched several judges to talk to the students.</p>
        <p>The fund, based in New York City, has run court monitoring programs in the state for 25 years. This year, Mr. Zeidman, a former law professor, turned to the college  to broaden its pool of monitors. Most monitors are older, retired people, and few are members of minorities. On the other hand, many of the participating John Jay students are black or Hispanic, and Mr. Zeidman hopes to expand the program to other City University colleges with similar ethnic compositions.</p>
        <p>This semester, he is working with students in two undergraduate classes at John Jay: Prof. James N. G. Cauthen's class in judicial processes and politics, and Prof. Diane M. Harmus's class in court administration. As part of their course work, the students must visit two judges at least twice and file a four-page report on each visit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zeidman has detected some differences in the perspective of the younger monitors. ''The students are more deferential to the judges than the other monitors, and they are also more likely to raise issues of gender and race, positively as well as negatively,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Several students criticized judges who did not wear robes in the courtroom, saying that it was an important sign of their authority. Some were also bothered by the seeming inattentiveness of some judges.</p>
        <p>''She should behave with a little more dignity and wear that robe,'' one student commented about a judge.</p>
        <p>Evaluating another judge, another student wrote: ''At one point during the trial, she looked bored. She picked up her purse and started looking through for about 5-10 minutes, then put her purse down on the bench, making a banging sound.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes court officials were helpful, asking student monitors whether they were lost or needed help. At other times, they were less than helpful. One judge made it  ''very uncomfortable for me to concentrate on the proceedings,'' a student wrote.</p>
        <p>''When she found out that I was not involved with any of the cases, she had one of her court officers sit right next to me until court was adjourned,'' the student reported. ''I could not take notes for my project, because it seemed like the court officer was trying extremely hard to read what I was writing. This seemed unusual, since court proceedings are open to the public.''</p>
        <p>Last Wednesday, Ms. Jezewski sat quietly in the third row in Criminal Court as Judge Uviller worked quickly and methodically through motions and other matters involving domestic disputes, robberies, assaults and other criminal charges.</p>
        <p>After three hours, Ms. Jezewski declared her efficient and kind. Ms. Jezewski particularly liked the fact that the judge commended former criminals who were doing well after they left prison.</p>
        <p>''It means so much to people,'' she said.</p>
        <p>In another courtroom another day, Ms. Jezewski was repelled by a judge's admonitions to the pregnant girlfriend of a convicted prisoner. ''It is O.K. for the judge to be critical of a defendant,'' she said, ''but I think the family is off limits.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Jezewski, who moved to New York from Poland seven years ago when she was 18, had thought she might go into criminology, but has decided she is more interested in court administration. But she believes that the courts are not perfect and that monitors make them better.</p>
        <p>''These reports make a difference,'' she said. ''It's like giving the power back to the people.''</p>
