        <p>It seemed gravity was suspended when the Keith Jarrett Trio performed on Saturday night at Carnegie Hall. Melodies hovered aloft, transparent and glowing from within; improvisations danced in midair. It was a quiet concert, filled with lapidary details and shared subtleties, light but never superficial. The music transformed fierce concentration into exquisite grace.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jarrett on piano, Gary Peacock on bass and Jack DeJohnette on drums have been playing standards together since 1983, and their concerts have become testimony to the continuity of a mainstream jazz tradition and the durability of their collaboration. They dipped into Tin Pan Alley songs, jazz tunes, blues and a ballad by Mr. Jarrett, ''So Tender.''</p>

        <p>It seemed gravity was suspended when the Keith Jarrett Trio performed on Saturday night at Carnegie Hall. Melodies hovered aloft, transparent and glowing from within; improvisations danced in midair. It was a quiet concert, filled with lapidary details and shared subtleties, light but never superficial. The music transformed fierce concentration into exquisite grace.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jarrett on piano, Gary Peacock on bass and Jack DeJohnette on drums have been playing standards together since 1983, and their concerts have become testimony to the continuity of a mainstream jazz tradition and the durability of their collaboration. They dipped into Tin Pan Alley songs, jazz tunes, blues and a ballad by Mr. Jarrett, ''So Tender.''</p>
        <p>The trio didn't get fidgety about form. Nearly every tune on the program used a theme-solos-theme template, and the musicians honored the rules of harmony. The tunes were Mr. Jarrett's to guide, and he made them translucent, almost ghostly, and endlessly mobile. Jazz tunes like ''Joy Spring'' were cleanly articulated and buoyant; ballads like ''Here's That Rainy Day'' arrived in limpid chords or matrices of counterpoint. Then Mr. Jarrett moved into arcs and streaks of improvised melody.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jarrett has been suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome, but it hasn't slowed down his fingers. Playing with a touch that was almost disembodied but always focused, he made phrases leap and trickle and scamper, then ring like distant bells. His well-known groaning was only occasional punctuation, hinting at effort behind his facility.</p>
        <p>He revealed once again the flexibility he shares with Ornette Coleman; lines shaped themselves independent of meter or chords, singing with a child's freedom. Yet his left hand was simultaneously tracing those underlying patterns, setting chords precisely where they'd swing best. The second set had earthier moments, touching down in blues and gospel, but the music was not so much percussive as grounded.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peacock's bass lines tiptoed around the roots of the chords and leaped upward for stretches of countermelody. Mr. DeJohnette tapped quick cymbal patterns and made sustained piano notes breathe with hushed cymbal-roll crescendos.</p>
        <p>One piece broke the theme-solos-theme format. ''Round Midnight'' began with a bass line, followed by Mr. Jarrett's mysterious, abstruse chords and an improvisation that raced and skipped, teasing against the music's pulse; the recognizable melody arrived near the end, only to dissolve in new harmonies and a final pensive soliloquy. It's nearly impossible to carry Thelonious Monk's tunes so far away from his shadow, but the trio was light-fingered enough to slip free of the tradition they know so well.</p>
