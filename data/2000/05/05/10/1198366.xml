        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that an antibiotic he was taking to treat an infection after a biopsy of his prostate made him uncomfortable during a speech.</p>

        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that an antibiotic he was taking to treat an infection after a biopsy of his prostate made him uncomfortable during a speech.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to take my jacket off,'' Mr. Giuliani said suddenly in the middle of remarks yesterday afternoon to a conference of mayors at the Grand Hyatt New York City. ''I feel very, very, ah -- I feel warm. Probably because I'm taking medicine. But I'm O.K. I'm not going to faint.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani, who announced late last month that he has prostate cancer in an early, treatable form, removed his jacket and continued his speech. He looked pale and wiped his brow at least once during his remarks. The mayor had the biopsy at Mount Sinai Medical Center on April 26.</p>
        <p>At a news conference after his speech, Mr. Giuliani brought up the topic of his medication almost immediately, before reporters had a chance to ask. ''The medicine that I'm using is an antibiotic,'' he said. ''So, not a big deal.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani then said, ''I feel fine.'' As reporters continued to ask questions, Mr. Giuliani offered: ''Want the name of the antibiotic? Cipro. C-I-P-R-O. It's commonly used.''</p>
        <p>Doctors say it is common to treat patients for infections after biopsies. Cipro is a widely used antibiotic for a variety of infections. The Physicians' Desk Reference, the standard guide to marketed drugs, lists fever as a possible side effect of Cipro in a small percentage of patients.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani went from his speech directly to One Police Plaza to stand at the side of his police commissioner, Howard Safir, who announced yesterday that he also has prostate cancer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said at his news conference yesterday that he was ''a little closer'' to making a decision about whether he would continue to run for United States Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton. But he said once again that he was not going to do ''daily updates'' on his health or his thinking about staying in the race.</p>
