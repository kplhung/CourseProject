        <p>After weeks of deliberations and a worldwide search for partners, Singapore Telecommunications is leaning against making a rival bid for Hong Kong's flagship telephone company, executives close to the company said today.</p>
        <p>The executives said Singapore Telecom was balking at the price it would have to pay for the company, Cable and Wireless HKT, to surpass an existing offer by Pacific Century CyberWorks.</p>
        <p>Pacific Century, a Hong Kong Internet start-up, has proposed acquiring Cable and Wireless HKT in a stock-and-cash bid currently valued at $26.9 billion. The board of Cable and Wireless HKT last week authorized the filing of a takeover document to be voted on by shareholders.</p>
        <p>Singapore Telecom was edged out once before in the battle for Hong Kong's phone company by Pacific Century. But after the global sell-off of technology stocks pushed down Pacific Century's own share price, Singapore Telecom revived the idea of a competing bid. Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, which had contributed $1 billion to the first offer, expressed interest in teaming up again.</p>
        <p>People close to Singapore Telecom cautioned that the partners could still make a move before the Cable and Wireless shareholder vote, which is scheduled for June 13. They also said that Singapore Telecom had not suspended talks with other potential partners, including a mainland Chinese phone company.</p>
        <p>But they acknowledged that the momentum had flagged in recent days.</p>
        <p>''The main reason they're leaning against it is they're worried about the price,'' an executive said. ''Cable and Wireless is a strategic asset, but it's a troubled asset.''</p>
        <p>Last week, Cable and Wireless HKT reported a 28 percent decline in its 1999 operating earnings, largely from sharply lower profits in its long-distance and cellular operations. Hong Kong's government has opened those markets to competition, and the stampede of new entrants is eroding HKT's market share.</p>
        <p>Given those troubles, there is the possibility that the rivals could become allies. A local newspaper, The Hong Kong Economic Times, reported today that Pacific Century was negotiating to sell Singapore Telecom a stake in Cable and Wireless HKT's fixed-line and mobile operations. Analysts say Pacific Century wants to limit its ownership of these assets.</p>
        <p>Pacific Century plans to recast Cable and Wireless HKT as a provider of Internet, e-commerce and broadband services. Though Pacific Century has few assets, it has the political connections of Richard Li, its 33-year-old founder, who is the son of Hong Kong's most powerful tycoon, Li Ka-shing. In less than a year, the company has become a shooting star in Asian cyberspace.</p>
        <p>Singapore Telecom, by contrast, is a nuts-and-bolts phone company controlled by the Singapore government. Its attempt to buy HKT was greeted coldly by authorities here, who viewed this as a foreign takeover.</p>
        <p>Singapore Telecom would probably not have re-emerged as a candidate for Cable and Wireless HKT, except for the more than 30 percent decline in Pacific Century's shares since its offer was announced. That reduced the value of its stock-and-cash bid to $26.9 billion from $35.9 billion.</p>
        <p>People close to Singapore Telecom said it could tempt Cable and Wireless by making an offer with far more cash. It could also make the proposal less troublesome politically by recruiting other partners, like a European, American or mainland Chinese phone company.</p>
        <p>But Singapore Telecom has not yet signed any partners, aside from the News Corporation. And people close to the company said its executives were not willing to offer enough cash to overcome the political liabilities.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Cable and Wireless P.L.C., the London-based parent of Cable and Wireless HKT, says it remains committed to the deal with Pacific Century, despite the drop in its share value. The company is ''very comfortable and very happy to be taking shares in PCCW,'' said Graham Wallace, the chairman of Cable and Wireless, after a board meeting of the Hong Kong subsidiary last week.</p>
