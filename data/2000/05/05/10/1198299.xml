        <p>CHEESES from Spain were once a rarity in American shops. Now, even supermarkets are selling mild, ivory Manchego, and the more powerful Cabrales and Mahon are becoming easier to find, too.</p>
        <p>But leaving it at that would be like representing Italy only with Parmesan, pecorino and fontina. Or just being able to buy Brie, Roquefort and Montrachet from France.</p>
        <p>Like those countries, Spain produces scores of distinctive cheeses. But in Spain, many are still made in tiny batches, sometimes on farms with just a single herd of sheep or goats. These mom-and-pop producers make just enough to supply their villages.</p>
        <p>''Most of them are very local, just farmers who made traditional cheeses for their area,'' said Jose Guerra, the marketing manager for Foods From Spain in New York, a government trade group. In fact, Mr. Guerra said, until recently you couldn't even find these regional cheeses in Madrid.</p>
        <p>It seems something of a miracle that over the last few years so many of these assertive, richly nutty cheeses have begun making their way to America, thanks in part to the Spanish government's promotion and also because of the growing interest among cheese connoisseurs here. More than 1.5 million pounds of Spanish cheese were imported last year, up from just over 650,000 pounds in 1995, according to the United States Commerce Department. But even now, some varieties, like the smoky Idiazabal, are available only sporadically.</p>
        <p>They are worth seeking out -- in some respects, even more than many of the imported French varieties. Many of the best traditional French cheeses are made from unpasteurized milk and aged less than 60 days, so they don't comply with United States government regulations. (Many Bries and Camemberts are modified for export and made with pasteurized milk.) But with Spanish cheese, it's possible to sample the best here: though most are made from unpasteurized milk, a great many traditional Spanish cheeses have always been aged more than 60 days.</p>
        <p>''French cheeses have become more compromised by industrialization and demand,'' said Max McCalman, the cheese expert at Picholine in Manhattan. ''Now is a good time to get Spanish cheese, before it is industrialized.''</p>
        <p>More Spanish cheeses are made from sheep's milk or goat's milk than from cow's milk. Many are made from a mixture of the three, which varies depending on the season. Though many people may think of sharp pecorino as typical of sheep's milk cheeses, in Spain they vary from buttery to strongly assertive.</p>
        <p>''Spanish cheeses are more artisanal and look less factory-made,'' said Kevin Tyldesley, the cheese buyer at Gramercy Tavern. ''But there's a lot less diversity of style. For example, I haven't come across really soft, soft cheeses like Camemberts or triple creams from France.''</p>
        <p>Gramercy Tavern is on a growing list of restaurants serving Spanish cheese. Picholine, Hell's Kitchen and Acquario also buy them, as do places that serve Spanish food, including Solera, Placido Domingo's, Meigas and Bolo. Most of the time, they're on the cheese tray or the tapas menu, although Bolo routinely makes salads with Cabrales, Spain's great blue cheese, and Hell's Kitchen uses Manchego and Idiazabal in its quesadillas.</p>
        <p>The best way to begin a love affair with Spanish cheese is to taste. Visit a good cheese shop -- one that is well stocked and has a high turnover -- and ask for sample slivers of three or four. Then buy two to take home and nibble with some cured ham or olives at cocktail time, the way the Spaniards do. Or serve them with fresh or dried fruit, or a drizzle of honey at the end of dinner. Some cheese shops sell membrillo, winy Spanish quince paste, which often accompanies wedges of cheese for dessert.</p>
        <p>Manchego, Spain's most popular cheese, is good for novices. For one thing, the cheese has eye appeal: dark rinds of the thick cylinders are beautifully patterned with close crosshatching from the molds in which they are made. Manchego is a sheep's milk cheese usually aged three months to a year, during which time its pale off-white interior gradually deepens to ivory. It has a relatively mild flavor, especially when young, and hints of walnuts as it ages. Chunks of aged manchego are delicious steeped for an hour or so in fruity olive oil. Two other cheeses, Zamorano and Castellano, are similar to Manchego, and many people prefer their somewhat more complex flavor.</p>
        <p>Iberico, unlike the others, is a factory-made cheese that has less character than the traditional varieties; cheese exporters expected it would have more appeal and began promoting it about nine years ago, Mr. Guerra said.</p>
        <p>Mahon, a cow's milk cheese from the island of Minorca, with an orange rind, has the kind of nuttiness with buttery overtones you might associate with aged Monterey Jack and is good used just the same way.</p>
        <p>Roncal, a classic firm-textured sheep's milk cheese from Navarre, in northern Spain, has been made for more than 1,000 years and was the first of about a dozen cheeses to be given an official appellation, or denominacion de origen. A deep ivory cheese with saltiness tempered with a touch of sweet, it is excellent when used like Parmigiano-Reggiano.</p>
        <p>Torta del Casar is an aromatic satiny sheep's milk cheese that can become as fluently lush and full flavored as Vacherin.</p>
        <p>Idiazabal, a smoked sheep's milk cheese from the Basque country, has a pale interior and firm, supple texture similar to provolone. ''The smoked flavor is well balanced and doesn't have a plastic quality of many smoked cheeses,'' Mr. Tyldesley said. Try it in a stuffing for baked chicken breasts, or in a grilled portobello mushroom sandwich.</p>
        <p>Another intriguing smoked cheese is San Simon, which is almost egg shaped and resembles scamorza, the Italian smoked mozzarella. Tetilla, the mildest and among the least distinctive tasting of Spanish cheeses, is cow's milk cheese similar to San Simon, but not smoked.</p>
        <p>Garroxta (pronounced ga-RO-cha), from Catalonia, is a goat's milk cheese with a sturdy gray rind, a white interior and delightfully herbal overtones. It is less crumbly than French or American goat cheeses, and though it has a certain sharpness it doesn't have a strong goaty flavor.</p>
        <p>Queso de Murcia al Vino, or Drunken Goat, is becoming one of the most popular Spanish cheeses in the United States. It is a smooth, mild white goat cheese with a faintly winy aroma.</p>
        <p>Cabrales, Spain's famous blue-veined cheese from Asturias, can be difficult to find in good condition. In some American shops, it is too strong and almost gummy -- the result of inconsistent temperature or humidity. The cheese should be on the soft side with clearly defined veining, a grassy aroma and a pungent, complex, but not overly salty flavor.</p>
        <p>Picon, made in the neighboring province of Cantabria, is almost identical. If the Cabrales doesn't pass muster, try the Picon.</p>
        <p>Spanish cooks make relatively little use of cheese. Paella, for example, is not routinely dusted with grated cheese the way Italian risotto is.</p>
        <p>''Many Italian cheeses are used in cooking,'' Mr. McCalman said, ''whereas in Spain, cheese is a food, often consumed as an appetizer course.'' Steak with a creamy sauce of Cabrales is a rare example of a Spanish dish made with cheese.</p>
        <p>But Spanish cheeses make excellent substitutes for Italian, French or American ones in many dishes, especially when the ingredients owe allegiance to Spain.</p>
        <p>I shredded Roncal over asparagus for baking, much the way Parmigiano-Reggiano is used in northern Italy. Thin shavings of mild young Manchego glazed individual pizzas made with a saffron-scented dough, roasted red peppers and chorizo. And little nuggets of Idiazabal folded in at the last minute imparted a subtle smokiness to a rice pilaf colored and seasoned with fresh herbs and garlic.</p>
        <p>After just a little experimenting, I could see Manchego, Garroxta and Idiazabal becoming as essential in my kitchen as Parmesan, Gruyere and Cheddar.</p>
        <p>Little Black Book For Cheese Lovers</p>
        <p>SINCE so many Spanish cheeses are made from sheep's milk, they are not cheap, usually ranging from $10 to $20 a pound. And the ones coming from small farms are available in very limited quantities, and even then only sporadically.</p>

        <p>BAKED POTATOES WITH CABRALES CHEESE  Adapted from the Cabrales Cheese Producers Council  Time: 1 hour 45 minutes</p>
        <p>4 medium russet or other baking potatoes  1 1/2 tablespoons butter  1 ounce Cabrales cheese (about  1/4 cup crumbled)  1 large egg, separated</p>
        <p>3/4 cup warm milk, or as needed  Nutmeg  Salt.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Bake potatoes on baking sheet until tender in center when pierced, about 1 hour. Remove from  heat, and cool just enough to handle.</p>
        <p>2. Cut potatoes in half lengthwise. Scoop insides into a large mixing bowl, taking care to keep skins intact. Set aside potato skins.</p>
        <p>3. Preheat a broiler or 450-degree oven. Add butter, Cabrales and egg yolk to potatoes. Mash mixture, adding just enough milk to make a thick puree. Using an electric mixer, whisk egg white until stiff but not dry. Fold egg white gently into puree until blended.</p>
        <p>4. Fill potato skins with mashed potato mixture. Place potatoes under broiler or in oven until golden on top. Serve hot.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>ASPARAGUS BAKED WITH RONCAL CHEESE  Time: 25 minutes</p>
        <p>1 1/2 pounds medium-thick asparagus  2 1/2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, preferably Spanish  Salt and freshly ground black pepper  2 ounces serrano ham or prosciutto, finely chopped (optional)  2 ounces Roncal, Mahon or aged Manchego, shredded  2 tablespoons finely ground almonds (not blanched).</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Snap off woody ends of asparagus, and peel stalks. Place in baking dish, add 2 tablespoons oil and roll asparagus to coat well. Arrange them in one layer, and season with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>2. Scatter ham (if using), cheese and almonds over asparagus. Drizzle with remaining oil, and bake 15 to 20 minutes, until cheese melts.</p>
        <p>Yield: 2 to 3 servings.</p>
        <p>MANCHEGO CHEESE, RED PEPPER AND CHORIZO PIZZA  Time: 1 hour 30 minutes</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon saffron threads  1 package active dry yeast  1 teaspoon salt  4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, preferably Spanish  2 1/2 cups flour, approximately  2 red bell peppers  8 ounces Manchego cheese (aged 3 to 6 months), shaved paper thin  2 ounces ready-to-eat chorizo or pepperoni, sliced paper thin.</p>
        <p>1. Mix saffron and yeast in medium-size bowl. Add  1/2 cup very warm water, stir and set aside 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Mix in salt, 3 tablespoons oil and  1/3 cup warm water. Add flour  1/2 cup at a time until dough forms. Knead on floured surface until elastic, about 5 minutes. Oil mixing bowl with 1 teaspoon of oil, roll dough around in it, loosely cover and allow to rise until doubled, about 1 hour.</p>
        <p>3. Meanwhile, heat broiler. Place peppers in baking dish, and broil on all sides until blackened. Remove, let cool covered loosely. Peel off blackened skin, remove cores and seeds and cut or tear in strips  1/2 inch wide.</p>
        <p>4. Preheat oven to 500 degrees. Lightly oil large baking sheet.</p>
        <p>5. Punch dough down. Knead briefly, and cut in quarters. Roll each in a circle about 6 inches in diameter. Place on baking sheet, and prick them. Scatter about  1/3 of the cheese on dough, top with pepper strips and chorizo, then add remaining cheese. Drizzle with remaining oil.</p>
        <p>6. Bake about 20 minutes, until cheese has melted and pizzas are lightly browned.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>GREEN RICE WITH IDIAZABAL CHEESE  Time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>4 cloves garlic</p>
        <p>1/2 cup packed flat-leaf parsley leaves  2 tablespoons cilantro leaves  1 tablespoon mint leaves  3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, preferably Spanish  1 cup finely chopped Spanish onion  2 cups rice, preferably short grain Spanish  3 1/2 cups chicken stock  Salt and freshly ground black pepper</p>
        <p>1/2 pound Idiazabal cheese, cubed.</p>
        <p>1. Turn on food processor, and drop in garlic through feed tube. Add parsley, cilantro and mint through feed tube. Drizzle in 1 tablespoon olive oil. Set aside.</p>
        <p>2. Heat remaining oil in heavy 3-quart saucepan. Add onion, saute over medium heat until translucent, and stir in rice. Cook, stirring, a few minutes, then fold in parsley mixture. Add stock, bring to simmer, add salt and pepper if needed. Cover, lower heat, and cook 17 minutes, until rice is al dente. Fold in cheese. Cover, and remove from heat. Let rest 5 to 10 minutes, then serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 to 8 servings.</p>
