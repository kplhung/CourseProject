        <p>One of Russia's leading missile scientists, Yuri P. Savelyev, was always more than willing to teach advanced rocket-building to Iranian engineers, who are said to be working on missiles that could reach most Middle Eastern capitals, and even Alaska.</p>
        <p>When Russian government officials tried to stop him four years ago because Russia had signed an international agreement to control the spread of ballistic missile technology, Mr. Savelyev persisted.</p>
        <p>As the rector of the famous Baltic State Technical University, he developed a program to teach students from a leading Iranian university courses in advanced physics, metallurgy and the behavior of gases and fluids under high pressure and temperature -- all disciplines essential to building rockets.</p>
        <p>That was done, he said, with the full knowledge of the Russian Defense Ministry and the national intelligence agency, known as the Federal Security Service, of which Mr. Savelyev's deputy is a member.</p>
        <p>Then last February, after complaints from the Clinton administration, Mr. Savelyev was ordered to shut down the program. He was summoned to Moscow by the Ministry of Education, where he was reprimanded and threatened with dismissal for concealing the educational program that was under way both here and in Iran.</p>
        <p>''I really have big problems,'' he said, seated near a display cabinet where he keeps a portrait of Iran's late spiritual leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. ''I now have as my antagonists the Russian government and the American government and I think one way or the other, they will find a way to fire me from the post of rector.''</p>
        <p>As concerns mount in the United States and Israel that Iran's secretive missile and nuclear weapons programs could pose new threats in the region, the case of Mr. Savelyev illustrates the behind-the-scenes cooperation between the Russian and American governments to stem the flow of missile technologies to Iran. But at the same time, it also reveals the deep-seated resistance within the Russian military and security establishment against abandoning Russia's ''strategic'' role in cultivating clients and lucrative contracts for transferring military science and technology.</p>
        <p>''I would tell you honestly that I wanted to work with them,'' Mr. Savelyev said of his Iranian contacts, ''and I would be teaching Iranians rocket technology today if I could because otherwise I would have my professors going to the market to sell fruits and vegetables to earn a living.''</p>
        <p>In a lengthy interview, Mr. Savelyev defended his activities, saying he was unfairly disciplined because of his hard-line nationalistic views and because he has become a vocal critic of President Vladimir V. Putin's cooperation with the United States on arms control initiatives. Mr. Savelyev contends that such cooperation will weaken Russia's own rocket forces and will alienate Iran.</p>
        <p>''I believe there is nothing more important than having Iran as our ally,'' he said, ''because if we fell into a state of animosity with Iran, the whole of Central Asia could be lost to the influence of the Islamic world.'' He also argues that if Russia does not help Iran build medium range ballistic missiles, ''North Korea and China are ready to offer Iran help with new rocket programs.''</p>
        <p>Last month in Washington, the State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, singled out Mr. Savelyev as a threat to United States security interests. In announcing that the United States was lifting sanctions on several Russian organizations suspected of providing assistance to Iran's ballistic missile program, including Baltic State, Mr. Rubin said a ban on all contact or educational exchanges with Mr. Savelyev ''personally'' would remain in force.</p>
        <p>''The rector is believed to have violated Russian export controls and attempted to export goods or services that could contribute to missiles capable of delivering weapons of mass destruction,'' Mr. Rubin said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Savelyev denied that characterization, saying he never transferred more than a good education in basic science. ''Can Newton's law of gravity be taught to Iranian students?'' he asked with a defiant tone. ''Because if you don't know the laws of gravity, you cannot build rockets.''</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Savelyev, 62, is still rector at Baltic State, one of Russia's most prestigious scientific centers. ''I have been a rocket builder all my life,'' he said, ''and many of the leading Russian rocket builders have graduated from this university,'' whose laboratories were shrouded in secrecy until 1991 and, even today, remain off limits to foreigners.</p>
        <p>One of the most famous graduates of Baltic State was the late Vladimir F. Utkin, who designed Russia's most fearsome land-based strategic rocket, the SS-18 ''Satan,'' whose payload of 10 independently targetable warheads spawned fears in the West that Moscow would mount a pre-emptive nuclear strike to wipe out American missile fields and then try to force an American surrender or ride out a nuclear war.</p>
        <p>Mr. Savelyev's relationship with Iran began in mid-1996, when he received a telephone call from an Iranian diplomat in Moscow to discuss an educational proposal. ''I can say that at that time, they were more concerned with preparing specialists in rocket construction'' than any general education, he said.</p>
        <p>Days later Mr. Savelyev greeted an Iranian delegation here that included two rocket experts from Iran's Ministry of Defense, as well as an Iranian intelligence officer.</p>
        <p>The meeting resulted in a handwritten agreement to train Iranian scientists in rocketry, but when Mr. Savelyev forwarded the document to the Education Ministry in Moscow, the program was rejected because only a year before Russia had signed the Missile Technology Control Regime, an agreement by more than two dozen nations to control the spread of missile technology.</p>
        <p>''Nevertheless, the Iranians still wanted to have their students study here,'' he said. And by the fall of 1996, Mr. Savelyev said, ''we welcomed 26 Iranian students'' to study for undergraduate degrees in mechanical engineering and general science courses.</p>
        <p>In early 1997, Israeli officials warned the Clinton administration that a number of Russian organizations were assisting Iran's missile program and American intelligence agencies confirmed that as many as 20 such firms and institutes, including Baltic State, were involved.</p>
        <p>Mr. Savelyev denies the charge, but adds that he believes that the original handwritten agreement he signed with Iran in 1996, though never carried out, fell into the hands of Western intelligence.</p>
        <p>Shortly after the initial group of Iranian students graduated from Baltic State in April 1998, new concerns arose in the United States. A special panel headed by a former defense secretary, Donald H. Rumsfeld, estimated that Iran's missile program had made significant strides and might be able to develop an ICBM capable of reaching the United States. Then, in late July of that year, Iran created a sensation in the Middle East by test-firing a medium range ballistic missile prototype, the Shahab-3, that can carry a 1,500 pound warhead 800 miles.</p>
        <p>Russia, under pressure from the United States, announced that it was investigating Baltic State and eight other organizations for exporting technologies that could have military uses. Throughout the spring of 1998, Mr. Savelyev said, Baltic State's undergraduate program for Iranian students was thoroughly investigated by a government commission.</p>
        <p>''They reached the conclusion that Baltic State was not teaching anything related to rocket construction,'' Mr. Savelyev said. But he was told that if he wanted to continue teaching Iranian students he would have to draw up a detailed course list and submit it to Moscow for approval.</p>
        <p>That summer, he and his staff drew up a course list of 111 specialized subjects that Baltic State wanted to offer to foreign students as a means to earn income for the university. Each course outline ran more than 40 pages, and the government commission spent nine months reviewing it before approving all but 12 subjects, Mr. Savelyev said. Among the rejected courses were the study of ''fuse technology,'' the design of ''antitank rockets'' and ''ignition and explosives.''</p>
        <p>Armed with this approval, Mr. Savelyev sent out advertisements to universities in Iran, China, Syria, India and Vietnam offering to train graduate students in advanced sciences of metallurgy, gas and fluid dynamics in conditions of high-temperature and pressure and other disciplines that could be considered the basics of rocket science.</p>
        <p>Three Iranian universities responded, but Mr. Savelyev said two of them were on a secret list of 305 organizations in Iran with which Russian universities are forbidden to have contact. ''The government sent this list to our university, but I had the feeling that this list was prepared by the C.I.A.,'' he said.</p>
        <p>What was not on the list was K. N. Toosi University of Technology in Tehran, Iran, whose dean, S. N. Mousavi, was anxious to have his graduate students in mechanical engineering study under Russian professors.</p>
        <p>Without informing the Russian government, Mr. Savelyev flew to Tehran in September 1999 and signed an agreement with Mr. Mousavi to begin training the first 17 Iranian students immediately. Throughout last fall and up until February of this year, about two dozen Russian professors shuttled to Iran to teach courses in three-week segments, for which they were paid $1,000 each trip.</p>
        <p>But a month into the program, the United States again intervened.</p>
        <p>In an October 1999 letter from Vice President Al Gore to Mr. Putin, who was then the prime minister, the Clinton administration complained that Russia was failing to take action against Russian institutions that were still assisting Iran's missile program. Mr. Savelyev said the letter was read to him by a member of Mr. Putin's staff.</p>
        <p>On Dec. 20, Russia's Federal Service for Currency and Export Control opened an investigation that concluded two months later that Baltic State was indeed transferring expertise that could be useful to Iran's missile program and, therefore, was acting contrary to Russian national interests.</p>
        <p>The deputy director of the export control agency, Sergei F. Yakimov, issued an order to Baltic State on Feb. 11 to shut down the program. Now, three months later, the professors who worked on the Iran program are back teaching Russians.</p>
        <p>Last month, Russia's education minister, Vladimir M. Filippov, publicly rebuked Mr. Savelyev, saying he ''was given a severe reprimand and a warning'' for violating a ''whole series'' of secret orders from the ministry pertaining to educational services to Iran.</p>
        <p>But even as Mr. Savelyev was being disciplined, Russia's Ministry of Defense was defending the program for Iranian students. A top Russian defense official argued that the investigation of Mr. Savelyev did ''not contain evidence of violation of Russian legislation on military-technical cooperation and export control.''</p>
        <p>First Deputy Minister of Defense Nikolai V. Mikhailov stated, in a letter to the export control ministry, ''The Ministry of Defense does not see danger to the security of the Russian Federation in education of foreign citizens including the citizens of Iran.''</p>
        <p>The university's program of courses for Iranian students was carefully screened by the Ministry of Defense and other experts, he said, and added, ''On the whole, the higher education of foreign citizens in Russian language and Russian technical standards is extremely useful for Russia in strategic terms.''</p>
