        <p>The owners of the Lincoln Building, a 1.2-million-square-foot structure diagonally across 42nd Street from Grand Central Terminal, have had a close-up view of neighborhood improvements in recent years.

        <p>The program includes wiring for the Internet, replacing all single-pane windows with more energy-efficient double-pane units, adding computer controls for the elevators and remodeling the interiors of the cabs, adding new bathrooms and air-conditioning the hallways.</p>

        <p>The owners of the Lincoln Building, a 1.2-million-square-foot structure diagonally across 42nd Street from Grand Central Terminal, have had a close-up view of neighborhood improvements in recent years. Now they are beginning their own renovation, a $30 million program that includes preparing space to attract office users larger than the small tenants who have long occupied most of the building.</p>
        <p>The program includes wiring for the Internet, replacing all single-pane windows with more energy-efficient double-pane units, adding computer controls for the elevators and remodeling the interiors of the cabs, adding new bathrooms and air-conditioning the hallways.</p>
        <p>The intention is to make the 70-year-old building, which has 600 tenants at 60 East 42nd Street, attractive to tenants who want all the amenities and services of a much newer building. Some small tenants in the building who occupy just a few hundred square feet may be forced to look elsewhere; the owners are assembling blocks of 5,000 to 10,000 square feet of space that could attract larger tenants who may be better able to pay annual rents that are now about $50 a square foot.</p>
        <p>The investment in the Lincoln Building was prompted by a $300 million renovation of Grand Central Terminal and the general improvement of the neighborhood, said Peter L. Malkin, the chairman of Wien &amp; Malkin, a law firm and real estate asset manager, and the general partner in the syndicates that own the building and the master operating lease. Mr. Malkin, who is in a legal dispute with Helmsley-Spear, the building's manager, is acting as the owners' representative. ''We want to reposition the building to be No. 1 in an area that is a hub of transportation,'' said Mr. Malkin, noting that plans are under way to have Long Island Rail Road trains stop at Grand Central.</p>
        <p>In fact, the building has underground access to both the rail terminal and the Lexington Avenue and Times Square shuttle subway lines. The door between the building and the passages leading to Grand Central and the subway was reopened about a year ago after having been closed for 25 years, said Kevin J. Driscoll, the building's general manager. Mr. Driscoll said the decision to open the door came as crime and the number of homeless people living in the area were both reduced.</p>
        <p>Mr. Malkin, whose office is in the building, had something to do with the changes in the neighborhood. He was one of the founders of the Grand Central Partnership, a business improvement district that provides cleaning and security services on the streets and offers consulting to small businesses in the district.</p>
        <p>Mr. Malkin quoted his late father-in-law, Lawrence A. Wien, as saying the law firm believed in ''enlightened self-interest.'' When Mr. Wien led the group that bought the building in 1954, he installed a law library that was available to anyone in the building and has a full-time librarian. Not surprisingly, 92 lawyers and law firms are tenants.</p>
        <p>Part of the renovation is to move the library from a lower-level concourse to the lobby level and combine it with a conference center equipped with advanced communications equipment. The conference center will be on the Madison Avenue side of the building, which has an entrance on the avenue as well as on 42nd and 41st Streets.</p>
        <p>Since rents in the building have risen to about $50 a square foot from the high $20's and low $30's per square foot annually as recently as five years ago, Fred C. Pozniak, director of marketing for Wein &amp; Malkin, said some tenants may want to economize by eliminating seldom-used conference rooms in favor of renting the center as needed.</p>
        <p>All bathrooms in the building are being renovated at a cost of $80,000 each, Mr. Driscoll said. Because of the building's age, much of the plumbing had to be replaced.</p>
        <p>Security is also being improved with the installation of a computerized system that will read coded cards issued to tenants and their employees. The system will record the names of people entering or leaving the building and how long they were inside.</p>
        <p>Mr. Malkin said the building's managers had been coordinating the expirations of leases so that those on each floor of the 55-story structure will roll over at the same time. The  seventh floor on the Madison Avenue wing has been assembled into an 11,000-square-foot space. ''When the time comes we will evaluate the market for 5,000-, 10,000- and 15,000-square-foot units, and we will be free to do that if appropriate,'' he said.</p>
