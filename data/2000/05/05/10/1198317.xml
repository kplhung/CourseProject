        <p>Investigators pursuing what the Nigerian government says is billions of dollars looted from the West African country during the rule of its late leader, Sani Abacha, have found $630 million in Luxembourg bank accounts connected with his sons.</p>
        <p>The investigation, which has now uncovered more than $1 billion in European accounts in the names of the Abacha family or associates, has embarrassed officials in Switzerland and set off an investigation of Credit Suisse, one of the country's two biggest banks, where part of an additional $654 million in Nigerian money was found.</p>
        <p>The latest amounts disclosed had been put in eight bank accounts at the Luxembourg office of M. M. Warburg &amp; Co., a private bank, in the names of Alhaji Sani Mohammed and Abba Mohammed Sani, Luxembourg officials confirmed. Those names were falsely used by two sons of Mr. Abacha, Mohammed and Abba, said a lawyer for the Nigerian government.</p>
        <p>The accounts have been frozen, according to Jean-Paul Frising, the deputy prosecutor in Luxembourg, and documents verifying the accounts have been sent to the Nigerian government, which now must ask that the money be returned.</p>
        <p>That request will be made before the end of the month, said a lawyer for Nigeria's new democratically elected government, which claims that Mr. Abacha embezzled more than $2 billion, much of it through the nation's central bank, during the five years he controlled the African country. He died in June 1998.</p>
        <p>The hunt for Abacha-related money also turned up more than $300 million in England last month. The money was originally transferred there to pay Russian firms for building the Ajaokutu steel factory in Nigeria, but found its way into the Abacha family accounts. That money is being disputed, with a Geneva financier claiming the money on the grounds that the Russians had signed the debt over to him.</p>
        <p>Swiss authorities have been conducting an extensive investigation because the money found in the country, which is the most since Ferdinand Marcos, the former Philippine dictator, hid $550 million here, cannot be returned without proof that it was the product of illegal acts. Last month, Geneva officials charged a New Delhi businessman with fraudently using some of the money to repay Russian construction companies.</p>
        <p>That was followed by the indictment of an Abacha associate, Abubakar Bagudu, in London on April 26 on charges of money laundering, fraud, corrupt management and involvement in a criminal organization. That was in connection with the Ajaokuta steel venture and with two sales of vaccines, in 1995 and 1997, to Nigerian health agencies, which allegedly netted $66.6 million. Some $25 million of that illicit money is frozen in Geneva at the Banque du Gothard and Credit Agricole, according to legal papers.</p>
        <p>In an unusual procedure, an investigating magistrate, Georges Zecchin, of Geneva, flew to London where he indicted the Nigerian at the Swiss Embassy. Mr. Bagudu, the Abacha associate, who ran an import-export business in Nigeria, had traveled to Switzerland twice last year to answer questions, his lawyer said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bagudu maintains that any money in Switzerland is the proceeds of lawful business activities, and that he had settled Lagos's claims last summer in a civil lawsuit. However, when it appeared that he would not come to Geneva to be charged, the Swiss magistrate went to England.</p>
