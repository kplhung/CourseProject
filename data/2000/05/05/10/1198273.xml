        <p>IN the old days, the only reason I had to fly down to Perpignan from Paris was that French farmers were once again blocking the highway from Barcelona to keep out cheaper Spanish tomatoes. Or oranges. Not much of a news story unless someone got shot -- which, occasionally, someone did.</p>
        <p>The wine certainly wasn't a draw; it was mostly rough stuff, made with anything but noble grapes. There were pioneers, like Bernard Daure in Cases-de-Pene, but Languedoc and Roussillon were largely a vast expanse of vinous mediocrity.</p>
        <p>Two years ago, though, I went to visit the sea novelist Patrick O'Brian at his home in Colliure in Roussillon, near the Spanish border, and found that he made a little wine himself. Several days of driving around and tasting wines also rekindled my interest in the region.</p>
        <p>It was obvious that immense changes were taking place, and they still are. The area encompasses some 600,000 acres of vines, 50 percent more than in all the United States, and stretches roughly from Carcassonne in the west to Perpignan in the south and Montpellier in the east. The southwest of France used to produce millions of gallons of cheap wine, most of it consumed in Paris and other cities in the north.</p>
        <p>But slowly, over three or four decades, tens of thousands of acres of cheap vines have been pulled out. On the plains leading to the Mediterranean, commercial growers are cultivating cabernet sauvignon, merlot and chardonnay, much of it indifferent stuff but a vast improvement over the huge plantations of aramon that were there before.</p>
        <p>Big California wineries imported and began selling many of these wines during the domestic grape shortages of the early 1990's. They are designated Vin de Pays d'Oc, wines of the Oc region. Oc, or Occitan, is the old medieval Romance language of the region. Hence the name: Languedoc (Langue d'Oc).</p>
        <p>In recent years, young winemakers, frustrated by the high price of land elsewhere in France, have set up shop in the rugged back country of Languedoc, in the appellations of Faugeres, St.-Chinian, Minervois, Corbieres and the Cotes de Roussillon. In those small, hand-tended vineyards, the favorite grape is now syrah, the noble grape of the northern Rhone. Mourvedre and grenache are also important red wine grapes. Viognier is the white grape of the moment, but this is red wine country.</p>
        <p>In this setting, the syrah grape makes a rich, intense wine, which at its best can rival Rhone wines like Cornas, Cote Rotie and Chateauneuf-du-Pape. The most common appellation among these new wines is Coteaux de Languedoc. At the expensive end of that appellation is the superb 1997 Clos des Truffiers, an immense wine filled with the scents of berries and spices, produced entirely from syrah from old vines. When it can be found, it is about $90 a bottle. At the other end is a delightful blend of syrah and grenache, the '97 Garrigues Terroir de la Mejanelle, a full, rich, appealing, if one-dimensional wine, for about $10.</p>
        <p>A good sturdy, flavorful red from the Chateau de la Negly, a Coteaux de Languedoc la Clape, is a blend of carignan, alicante bouchet, tempranillo, grenache and just a touch of syrah. It has to be the most unusual blend of the year. More traditional perhaps is La Falaise from the Chateau de la Negly: syrah with mourvedre and grenache, a big powerful wine, aged entirely in new oak. Both Neglys are 1998's.</p>
        <p>The 1998's from Languedoc-Roussillon are fuller and richer than the 1997's, which were marred by rain and humidity. La Clape and Mejanelle are subregions within the Coteaux de Languedoc.</p>
        <p>White Languedoc wines are also imaginative. A Chateau de Lascaux (Coteaux du Languedoc Les Pierres d'Argent) blends roussanne, marsanne, rolle and viognier. (Rolle is the French name for the Italian vermentino grape.) It's a sipping wine, but a bit strong with food.</p>
        <p>From Roussillon, I have not yet tasted the 1998 from the Domaine du Mas Blanc, but I remember the domaine's 1993 Clos du Moulin from Collioure, a superb blend of mourvedre and syrah, like the best from Chateau Beaucastel in Chateauneuf-du-Pape. The 1993 was coming into its own only two years ago, so there is time to enjoy the newest release.</p>
        <p>The Daure family at Chateau de Jau, northwest of Perpignan, has been a pioneer in demanding quality over quantity for two decades. A 1998 Cotes du Roussillon-Villages from de Jau is an attractive blend of syrah and mourvedre with some grenache and carignane. Many Americans know de Jau for its easy-drinking, inexpensive Jaja du Jau, a widely available syrah-and-grenache blend.</p>
        <p>Mas de Daumas Gassac, another well-known Languedoc producer, has a 1998 Vin de Pays d'Herault, a light red with good fruit and some spice. I haven't yet tasted La Grange des Peres red, from the same appellation, Vin de Pays d'Herault, but I look forward to it. The wine, a discovery of the importer Kermit Lynch, is made by Laurent Vaille, who once worked at the Domaine Coche-Dury in Burgundy. The price has not been announced, but the line forms here.</p>
