        <p>A federal judge delayed the deportation of a 2-year-old boy to Thailand today, saying that he had questions about the boy's safety.</p>
        <p>The judge, Dickran Tevrizian of United States District Court, acting at the request of lawyers for the boy, Phanupong Khaisri, issued a temporary restraining order against the Immigration and Naturalization Service that prevented the agency from deporting him for 10 days.</p>
        <p>Judge Tevrizian said he had concerns about the boy's safety in Thailand, and scheduled a hearing for May 23.</p>
        <p>''I can't, as a parent . . . just simply return this child back to Thailand after what this child has been through,'' The Associated Press quoted him as saying.</p>
        <p>He said he would appoint two doctors to examine Phanupong, who had suffered an ear infection and flu after he arrived in the United States.  The restraining order came shortly after members of the Thai community here had gone to court to block Phanupong's return as they sought custody safeguards similar to those afforded Elian Gonzalez, the Cuban boy whose case has inflamed passions in Miami.</p>
        <p>Phanupong had been taken into custody on April 11 by the immigration service, which said he was being used as a decoy by a group smuggling women into the United States. The boy had been detained at Los Angeles International Airport with a man and woman posing as his parents.</p>
        <p>Advocates representing the child said they feared that sending him back to Thailand without more investigation could put him in jeopardy.</p>
        <p>The Thai government, working with the immigration service, had intended to return the boy to Thailand today. But advocates refused to give the boy to Thai officials this morning and filed a lawsuit.</p>
        <p>After he arrived in the United States, the boy had been placed with a social worker through the Thai Community Development Center, a nonprofit organization that serves the Thai residents in California.</p>
        <p>According to the lawsuit, the boy's mother was sold into sexual slavery at the age of 12, and Phanupong had been in the care of his maternal grandmother until February, when his mother sold him for about $260. It is believed that he had been used as a decoy at least two other times.</p>
        <p>The father, according to the lawsuit, had contracted H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, and had committed suicide when the boy was just a few months old.</p>
        <p>Although the paternal grandparents have agreed to adopt Phanupong, advocates for the boy said they believed the case was being rushed in a way that could further traumatize him. They said they feared that the boy would be placed in an orphanage while his adoption was processed.</p>
        <p>''Given the widespread nature of corruption, bribery and child trafficking in Thailand, we are very concerned that unless custody is transferred to his paternal grandparents he may find himself back in the stream of illicit child trafficking once again,'' said Peter A. Schey, president of the Center for Human Rights and Constitutional Law, who filed the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit had asked that the immigration service provide a formal hearing before the boy leaves the country, that his parole status be extended temporarily if the request is not granted and that he be given temporary asylum while custodial arrangements are finalized.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schey said the United States Attorney's Office has agreed to try to resolve the case in the next two days.</p>
        <p>Sharon Gavin, a spokeswoman for the immigration service, said officials have been working with the Thai government to assure the boy's safe return.</p>
        <p>''We're all working toward the same goal: to ensure the safety and well being of the young boy,'' Ms. Gavin said.</p>
        <p>Chanchanit Martorell, executive director of the Thai Community Development Center, said that given the child's background and what he had been through, extra care was needed in the transition to a new home.</p>
        <p>Advocates for the boy question why the type of scrutiny that was given to Elian Gonzalez, whose father was interviewed and brought to the United States, was not being given to this child.</p>
        <p>They speculate that the United States is less inclined to go against a country with which it shares political and economic ties as opposed to a country such as Cuba.</p>
        <p>While there are few similarities between the two cases, Phanupong has no relatives in the United States and no one is seeking permanent residency for him, advocates feel that his case should have been given similar scrutiny.</p>
        <p>''Elian has been treated with kids gloves by the Attorney General, the I.N.S. and the president,'' Mr. Schey said. ''This child is being treated completely different.''</p>
