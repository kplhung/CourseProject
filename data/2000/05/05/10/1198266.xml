        <p>THEY arrive looking like a pile of sticks and leaves.</p>
        <p>The sticks are long, thin French fries. The leaves, a random mix of basil, sage, rosemary, parsley and savory, are emerald green and glossy, fried stiff.</p>
        <p>Most efforts (and unfortunately, there have been many) to improve on French fries by adding flavors or changing the technique have the same, seemingly inevitable result: regret. Potatoes, oil and salt, combined in just the right way, do not welcome intrusions.</p>
        <p>The herbed French fries at Thalia, however, do work. The herbs have flavor all their own and, tossed in chaotically as they are, turn up every other bite or so, a lush, aromatic interlocutor.</p>
        <p>And the fries are not diminished. They remain crisp, meaty, salty and appropriately dominant.</p>
        <p>''To me, fried herb sprigs are an afterthought, but these really have a purpose,'' Michael Otsuka, Thalia's chef, said.</p>
        <p>They also happen to be an incredibly easy flourish.</p>
        <p>Mr. Otsuka first bathes the potatoes in oil at a relatively cool temperature, 250 degrees, so that they cook through and soften, but do not brown.</p>
        <p>When he fries the potatoes the second time, he waits until they are three-quarters done, then tosses a handful of herb leaves and stems -- whatever mixture is available in the kitchen that day, be it all basil or a spectrum of herbs -- into the hot canola oil with the fries.</p>
        <p>In that last minute, the potatoes make their last turn toward golden crispness, and the herbs firm up without browning. Mr. Otsuka drains them together, seasoning them with salt and freshly ground black pepper.</p>
        <p>And the herbs do their thing, subtly swathing the fries -- respectfully, mind you -- with their gentle perfume.</p>
        <p>Technically, the herbed fries are a side dish. In my opinion, anything else, a cold beer excepted, would simply be a distraction.</p>
        <p>AMANDA HESSER</p>
        <p>Herbed French fries are $5 at the bar and on the lunch menu at Thalia, 828 Eighth Avenue (50th Street), (212) 399-4444.</p>
        <p>HERBED FRENCH FRIES  Adapted from Thalia  Time: 25 minutes, plus 45 minutes' soaking and 2 hours' refrigeration</p>
        <p>4 large russet potatoes, washed and cut into sticks  3/8 inch thick  2 quarts canola oil</p>
        <p>1/2 cup herb leaves and stems (any combination of rosemary, parsley, basil, sage, savory, oregano or tarragon)  Kosher salt and coarsely ground black pepper.</p>
        <p>1. Soak potato sticks in ice water for 45 minutes. Drain well, and pat dry on a kitchen towel.</p>
        <p>2. In a large, deep pot, heat oil to 250 degrees. Add potatoes, and cook until tender but not browned, about 5 minutes. Drain well, and transfer to a cookie sheet. (Allow oil in pot to cool, and reserve for the second frying.) Cool potatoes to room temperature. Cover with foil, and refrigerate for 2 hours.</p>
        <p>3. Heat oil to 350 degrees. Add chilled potatoes, and fry until light golden, about 5 minutes. Drop herbs into oil, and continue frying for 1 minute longer. Drain fries, and toss with salt and black pepper to taste.  Serve immediately.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
