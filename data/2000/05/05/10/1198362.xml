        <p>SAD but true: because Rickey Henderson does not move nearly as nimbly as he once did, the door will indeed whack him in the back on his way out.</p>
        <p>It's time. Never mind the fine line between regular waivers and unconditional waivers and any other waivers a team can seek. It's time to escort Rickey to the front door, thank him for his services and get on with the season.</p>
        <p>This is one of those great determining moments for the Mets. Are they serious about getting back into the playoffs? Everybody can see Henderson cannot play anymore, and not only that, he doesn't want to play anything resembling winning baseball.</p>
        <p>But the Mets have been caught up in some kind of bookkeeping malaise, trying to justify the prospect of paying a $2 million salary to a forwarding address. The forwarding address cannot kick singles into triples. Go for it.</p>
        <p>Pay the money, even though Henderson has stolen 1,336 bases, more than any other player in history. On his statistics, he is bound for the Baseball Hall of Fame.</p>
        <p>(One can hear the plaques of the immortals, living and dead, conversing in the quiet moments when the hall is closed for the night. The plaques will nod in the direction of Henderson's plaque and they will whisper, ''Hey, Rickey is Rickey,'' the 20-year description of his whimsical approach to life.</p>
        <p>It stopped being cute when his batting average plummeted toward the Mendoza line, and so did his attitude.)</p>
        <p>Less is more. Addition by subtraction. The Mets will be a better team the moment Henderson is out of uniform.</p>
        <p>''I don't anticipate releasing Rickey Henderson,'' said Steve Phillips, the general manager, using a fine Clintonian parsing of the truth.</p>
        <p>The key word there is anticipate -- not releasing. Phillips put the double-dribbling left fielder on waivers, surely not expecting that somebody would leak it to the waiting world, putting us all on Rickey watch.</p>
        <p>Phillips was rather hoping some general manager with no access to cable channels or the Internet or the daily box scores or the grapevine would think this was the 25-year-old Rickey or the 30-year-old Rickey or even the 40-year-old Rickey of last season, instead of the broken-down Rickey of this season.</p>
        <p>The oddity was that while the Mets waited out the waivers, Henderson was still in uniform, and not only that, but also leading off and playing left field in the Mets' 2-0 victory over the Pirates in Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>Even if he stirred himself to five hits and five stolen bases and managed to hold on to simple fly balls -- no automatic in recent weeks -- this would have been an anomaly. Babe Ruth, after all, poleaxed three home runs in a game shortly before his overdue retirement.</p>
        <p>Watching Henderson's suddenly rheumy eyes and weary legs has brought back sad memories of a 42-year-old Willie Mays stumbling around the basepaths in his final moments as a Met in 1973. But at least Mays was a New York icon, beloved by ownership and fans alike.</p>
        <p>Henderson has been a rent-a-Met, setting a bad example for young players. His card games in the clubhouse with the equally malcontent Bobby Bonilla nearly scuttled the Mets' October run last year. He went into a snit over double-switch lineup changes. Last year he had the credibility of a marvelous .315 season. This year he can't play, and he ain't funny.</p>
        <p>Who will play left field? Somebody. It has been enjoyable watching motivated younger players named Payton and Mora and Agbayani and Nunnally, along with the seasoned Derek Bell. They have been hustling and trying, and that's all you can ask.</p>
        <p>You could feel it in the air in Shea Stadium. Whenever Manager Bobby Valentine would double-switch Henderson out of a game -- and sometimes it seemed he was twitching to do it in the third inning -- you could hear a sigh, like a cool evening breeze.</p>
        <p>There are no Hall of Fame players in that lot, but it doesn't matter. This is no audition for a plaque. Some kid making close to the minimum salary will give more than Henderson has given: a .207 batting average with just 2 runs batted in, 14 runs scored and 2 stolen bases. Plus, his eyes are shot.</p>
        <p>There is nothing dishonorable about an athlete losing it at 41, or any age. But there is something unappealing about a player's punching the time clock, trying to add to his statistics.</p>
        <p>If the Mets' management is worried about eating Henderson's salary, it should put canisters alongside the turnstiles when the Mets come home Friday night. Let the fans vote with their quarters, the way they have been voting with their boos. Never has vox populi been more correct. Time to say goodbye.</p>
