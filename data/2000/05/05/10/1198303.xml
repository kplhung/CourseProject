        <p>Although the Justice Department and F.B.I. investigation to determine if John M.

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Although the Justice Department and F.B.I. investigation to determine if John M. Deutch, the former C.I.A. director, mishandled classified material by placing it on unsecured computers in his home may be in the right direction, those agencies may be missing some aspects of security (front page, May 6).</p>
        <p>For example, the same energies that are being used in the investigation should also be used in evaluating the C.I.A. security systems. A prudent security system would never allow the storage of classified material to be retained in someone's home either as hard copy, computer files or on a removable disk. From my past experience working for a government contractor, I know that our government would never allow a contractor doing classified work to do what Mr. Deutch did: retain classified information in one's home. Why are there different standards?</p>
