        <p>You peruse the box score this morning and see that Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell chipped paint off the rim, combining for more turnovers than baskets. Neither Larry Johnson nor Patrick Ewing found much of an offensive rhythm. You see missed free throws, 10 paltry assists and a near collapse at the end of the game.</p>
        <p>However ugly Game 2 got last night, the Knicks beat the Heat.</p>
        <p>''What does it say?'' Marcus Camby began after the Knicks returned to the brooding, offensively challenged team of playoffs past with their 82-76 victory. ''It says we can win without our key guys knocking down shots. In five playoff games, we haven't even really gotten into a nice flow on offense. Not like last year in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''We've got tons of room for improvement, that's how I look at it.''</p>
        <p>Camby seemed to grasp what Game 2 meant, how it illustrated the incredible margin for error the Knicks have in this Eastern Conference semifinal series, and how Miami has almost none. It showed a forgotten dimension to the Knicks' game, the nasty, ornery disposition that kept surfacing each time the Heat got back in the game.</p>
        <p>''You know, perception is interesting,'' Coach Jeff Van Gundy said. ''Everybody describes Miami as tough, competitive and great defensively.''</p>
        <p>He paused and added, ''But we are too.''</p>
        <p>Before a lot of volatile and emotionally wounded people at American Airlines Arena who wore bright red, the Knicks set themselves up beautifully in the four-of-seven-game series. They will play host to the next two games at Madison Square Garden, on Friday and Sunday, a perfect chance to go up, three games to one, after seizing their third split in three years against the Heat in Miami.</p>
        <p>The Knicks accomplished the feat by combating Pat Riley's swarming, mauling defensive schemes with some of their own. Camby, whom Van Gundy was taken to task for not playing at the end of Game 1, used his elongated frame to rotate over to Alonzo Mourning every time Ewing was beaten.</p>
        <p>He also switched Johnson to Mourning when Ewing picked up his third foul. At one juncture, Mourning missed 11 shots in a row. Unable to gather himself in the low post, he was not sure who would guard him next.</p>
        <p>Camby stayed out of foul trouble, finishing with 10 points, 7 rebounds and 3 blocked shots. He was indefatigable on the defensive end, making up for whatever mistakes the Knicks made one on one.</p>
        <p>Charlie Ward attacked the basket, going strong to the goal, right at the hobbling Tim Hardaway. He made Hardaway play defense and exploited the weak link in Miami's defense.</p>
        <p>A word about Van Gundy: after one measly playoff loss, it was suggested by some of his players and others to go with a big backcourt, to better exploit Hardaway. He held firm with Ward, choosing, as he said, ''doing it better over doing it different.''</p>
        <p>At any rate, as hard as it may have been to watch parts of this eyesore, this may have been the most clear-cut case to make for the Knicks' going to the finals for the second year in a row.</p>
        <p>Two of the most potent offensive players in all of pro basketball were kept in check, and they still won. Sprewell and Houston paired for a 5-of-27 night from the field. They were 2 for 18 in the first half, a feat that once took John Starks an entire playoff game.</p>
        <p>This was indeed a sloppy game, the sort only those with civic interest could find beauty in. In the first half, Miami made 7 of 20 free throws and the Knicks shot 28.2 percent. Astonishingly, they led, 38-34.</p>
        <p>Until midway through the third quarter, watching Ewing was painful. At the outset, he did not have any legs, hands, touch or mobility. Operating on pride and heart alone, his every move toward the rim was met by the long arms of Mourning or P. J. Brown. He did not find a rhythm of any sort till the end of the third quarter.</p>
        <p>But together, they got it done. Sprewell played more aggressively on defense against Jamal Mashburn, whose rubbish-time points did not exactly make up for how badly he fizzled during important moments.</p>
        <p>Ewing, back spasms notwithstanding, made himself more of a force against Mourning down low. In Game 1, he behaved like a cardboard cutout, signing a nonaggression pact with his close friend. While Mourning finished with 17 rebounds and 17 points in Game 2, he made only 5 of 18 shots.</p>
        <p>The Heat won't feel any satisfaction from holding Sprewell and Houston down. How a journeyman like Dan Majerle and players like Bruce Bowen and Mashburn are able to shake the confidence of the Knicks scorers is anyone's guess. It is a theme that may very well play out when the two teams meet at the Garden on Friday night in Game 3.</p>
        <p>But if you are Van Gundy, you cannot help but feel encouraged after what happened last night. Each time the Heat closed within a point or tied the game, his team responded and repelled Miami.</p>
        <p>His athletes were handcuffed, and the Big Fella often moved like molasses. But somehow the Knicks managed to find the defensive resolve to win a huge playoff game on another team's floor.</p>
        <p>Now Riley and his team come to New York, their postseason demons haunting them all over again. They are resilient and they probably will not be run off the Garden floor as easily as they were in Game 3 last season.</p>
        <p>But they have to be searching their minds, wondering why they cannot shake the Knicks when it matters.</p>
        <p>It was not pretty for either team, the equivalent of two club fighters flailing away at each other until someone either lost on cuts or was dropped. But it was the kind of homely affair a good team had to win to ever hope of achieving great things.</p>
        <p>Unthinkable, no? Houston's cool and Sprewell's fire were not needed when Riley's guys hit back. Without their one-two punch, the Knicks convincingly won. This is a better omen than Van Gundy will ever admit.</p>
