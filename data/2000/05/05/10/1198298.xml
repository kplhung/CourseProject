        <p>SINCE Elena Arzak took over the kitchen at the family's Michelin three-star restaurant here from her father, there have naturally been a few changes. But one tradition remains the same at Arzak: a dedication to fine Spanish cheese.</p>
        <p>Charles de Gaulle once remarked on the difficulty of governing a country with some 240 different kinds of cheese. By that standard, Spain's leaders have little to complain about since their country has only about 100.</p>
        <p>It's probably an exaggeration, but Arzak's cheese cart seemed to have most of them. At a dinner there recently, Ms. Arzak saved us the trouble of having to choose; she simply served four of the most renowned.</p>
        <p>We had queso de cabra de Vizcaya, a goat's milk cheese with mineral nuances in its flavor from Vizcaya province, where Bilbao is located. We had Idiazabal ahumado, a sharp, nutty-tasting and almost buttery smoked sheep's milk cheese from a village south of here, on the road to Navarre. And we had Cabrales con manzana, a sharp blue cheese from Asturias that she blends with a compote of apples from the same region.</p>
        <p>If that weren't indulgence enough, we also had torta del Casar, a soft young sheep's milk cheese from Extremadura that at its peak at this time of year, is soft and runny enough to eat with a spoon like a French Vacherin.</p>
        <p>The cheeses were served with the ceremony and sensibly small portions of a fine restaurant, and they were nicely matched with a 1990 Grand Reserva from Chivite. But I encountered the same reverence at little tapas bars and in country stores. Whether served with beer or the best sherry, on fine china or a toothpick, cheese in Spain is essential as bread itself.</p>
        <p>A two-week ramble through northern Spain served as a delightful primer to a little-known but spectacular part of Europe and a treasure trove of fine cheeses that are finally beginning to be appreciated in the United States.</p>
        <p>Northern Spain is sometimes called Green Spain, because its forests, lush valleys and snow-capped peaks belie the tourist image of oranges, flamenco and sun-baked villages. The region produces more than half of all Spain's best cheeses.</p>
        <p>Two mountain ranges, the Pyrenees and the Cantabrian cordillera, which stretch from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic, protect and nurture a culture more like Switzerland's than Southern Europe's. The massif of the Picos de Europa, in the center of the cordillera, has been called Spain's National Park of Cheeses because some 20  varieties are produced from the milk of the sheep, goats and cows that graze, often side by side, on its slopes.</p>
        <p>Driving from one town to another, from the mountains to the seaside and back to the mountains, we picked up the habit of stopping in late morning for tapas. Lunch in Spain, like dinner, is notoriously late in the day. No midday meal begins at midday; 2 p.m. is more the norm, and many restaurants are still busy serving lunch at 4.</p>
        <p>This means the long morning hours are best broken up with a few tapas, the delightful appetizers that are an integral part of Spanish life. Here in San Sebastian, which is Spain's unofficial capital of gastronomy, there are dozens of tapas bars, many of them clustered in the old part of the city between the harbor and the Central Market.</p>
        <p>Cheese, usually Manchego, is an important tapas, served in small slices bathed in olive oil and in chunks on toothpicks, alone or paired with serrano ham or chorizo. We soon learned to plunge into the noisy crowd at the bar, pick out what we wanted and back away, returning later to pay up. It's on the honor system, so you must save your toothpicks or little plates to keep count.</p>
        <p>Beer is the best drink with cheese tapas, although in Guernica we had good cider and in Logrono's tapas bars we drank simple red wine. Here in Basque country, txokoli (pronounced choc-o-LI), the local white wine, goes well with both cheese and the seemingly endless array of seafood tapas on offer -- octopus, hake, small crabs, anchovies and more.</p>
        <p>As with fine wines, the names of the best Spanish cheeses are controlled by the government to prevent the proliferation of cheap imitations. There are 12 denominacion de origen cheeses in Spain, almost all of them from the north. Two of the four we had at Arzak, the Cabrales and the Idiazabal. The Manchego of the tapas bars is another.</p>
        <p>Cabrales comes from Asturias, which nestles between Galicia and Cantabria along Spain's northern coast. The coastline is alternately rocky and sandy and is battered by strong winds and rain in winter. The interior, mountainous and rugged, is the source of the region's best cheeses.</p>
        <p>Cabrales resembles Roquefort but is creamier, its veining is a deeper blue and the flavor less salty. Both are usually aged in caves for three to six months.</p>
        <p>Idiazabal is from northwest Navarre and the Basque country. The name comes from a Basque village, where it is supposed to have originated. Traditionally, the cheese was made by Basque shepherds from the milk of Latxa sheep in communal shepherds' huts high in the Pyrenees, where all summer and into the fall they absorbed fireplace smoke. Today, the cheeses are smoked over hardwood.</p>
        <p>Not all Idiazabal is smoked, but all of it is made from unpasteurized sheep's milk. The raw milk is what gives Idiazabal its buttery texture and rich nutty taste. Smoking Idiazabal adds a delicious, dark aftertaste.</p>
        <p>The queso cabra de Vizcayo is a firm but spreadable goat's milk cheese from a region that specializes in sheep's milk cheeses. To me, it tasted a bit chalky but very flavorful.</p>
        <p>One of Elena Arzak's favorites -- and now one of mine, the torta del Casar, comes from Extremadura and is made from unpasteurized sheep's milk. The texture is creamy, so much so that the cheese can be scooped from the rind with a spoon, and the flavor is rich and nutty.</p>
        <p>One of the best cheese stories I came across in Spain -- the cheese is pretty good, too -- concerns Garrotxa (pronounced ga-RO-cha) from the town of the same name in the Mediterranean part of the Pyrenees. About 20 years ago, a small cooperative of goat farmers in that town decided to bring back a cheese that had been made in their region a hundred years earlier but had all but disappeared. The farmers were part of a ''neo-rural'' movement of young people who have decided to quit professional careers and return to the land.</p>
        <p>Farmhouse-style cheeses, made from goat's, sheep's and cow's milk, are a favorite project of the group. Garrotxa is one of these cheeses. It is soft and buttery, and is usually covered with a natural mold induced by the humid climate in the high pastures.</p>
        <p>A reason in itself to return to these mountains.</p>
