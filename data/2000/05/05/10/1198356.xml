        <p>BEFORE he bought a livery cab, Luis Jorge learned something about crime while running a bodega in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn. ''I was robbed four times at gunpoint,'' he recalled. But the Taxi and Limousine Commission has decided that he still doesn't understand the risks of armed robbery.</p>
        <p>Tonight, Mr. Jorge will be reluctantly joining fellow drivers at a meeting to learn about the commission's new rule requiring a partition or security camera in every livery cab. ''I'll comply because I have to,'' he said, ''but I don't think it's necessary, and I know a lot of drivers who feel the same way.''</p>
        <p>Safety regulations are often justified as necessary protections for workers against callous employers, but Mr. Jorge is his own employer. Presumably, he values his own life at least as much as the Taxi and Limousine Commission does.</p>
        <p>You could argue that Mr. Jorge suffers from faulty risk perception, the same problem that inspired seat-belt laws. Because people underestimated their chance of being in an accident, public officials ordered them to buckle up, and there's no doubt that the laws have saved lives.</p>
        <p>But the risk of traffic accidents is underestimated because they're routine and attract little publicity. Murders of livery-cab drivers are relatively rare -- about nine annually in recent years -- and receive plenty of attention. They're more like airline disasters, which get disproportionate publicity and therefore arouse irrational fears, especially when a few  are bunched together.</p>
        <p>If anything, livery-cab drivers may be prompted to overestimate their risks by press coverage of the recent string of murders. So if Mr. Jorge is nonetheless reluctant to pay for more security, he may be acting more rationally than the public officials demanding partitions.</p>
        <p>Unlike Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the members of the Taxi and Limousine Commission, Mr. Jorge isn't under pressure to go before television cameras and do something to stop a crime spree. He's personally weighing the costs and benefits, both for himself and for his passengers.</p>
        <p>''If I were picking up people on the street in the Bronx at night, I'd put in a partition,'' said Mr. Jorge, who lives in the Kensington section of Brooklyn. ''But I work only in the day, mainly in Midtown. I have a lot of private clients, and the rest of my business is from radio calls. I never pick up people on the street. I don't need to put anything in the car.''</p>
        <p>The city is giving the drivers $325 each to pay for the extra security, about the cost of a partition, which is the option most drivers are expected to choose. Mr. Jorge prefers to spend an additional $300 of his own money on a security camera instead. ''A partition just kills the car,'' he said.  ''There's less space for you and the passenger. The driver's seat has to be straight up all the time, so you get back problems. The air-conditioning doesn't work right. The passenger can't see out the front. You can't communicate well with the passenger and give him the same service, so your tips are smaller.''</p>
        <p>The Taxi and Limousine Commission justifies the partitions by pointing to the experience with the yellow cabs with medallions. ''Since we required the partitions in 1994, crime against medallion taxi drivers has dropped drastically,'' said Allan J. Fromberg, the commission's spokesman. ''The foremost reason is that the taxi industry has benefited from the overall drop in crime, but we believe partitions have played a significant roles as well.''</p>
        <p>But the commission hasn't bothered yet to analyze another consequence of the partitions: injured passengers. ''We see broken noses, cut faces, and broken cheekbones because of the partitions,'' said Edward McGettigan, the underwriting manager for the American Transit Insurance Company, which insures 6,800 medallion cabs, about half the city's fleet.</p>
        <p>Mr. McGettigan estimated that his company received 750 injury claims annually from passengers hurled against the partitions of those 6,800 cabs. When you consider that the commission's new policy affects some 26,000 livery cabs, you could conservatively extrapolate that the policy would lead to at least 1,000 additional injuries each year.</p>
        <p>Perhaps all those injuries, and all the other costs associated with the new policy, are a small price to pay for protecting drivers. But public officials haven't even begun to analyze the costs and benefits. Until they do, Mr. Jorge may be forgiven for assuming that he understands his business better than they do.</p>
