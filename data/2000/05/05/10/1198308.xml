        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>BRITAIN: BLAIR DEFIANT  In his first speech since his most significant setback in three years in office, Prime Minister Tony Blair said he would not change his government's program to suit his critics. ''Come fair weather or foul we intend to stick to the course we have set out,'' he said in an uncompromising address to the Periodical Publishers' Association. In elections last week, Mr. Blair suffered the loss of nearly 600 local council seats and the indignity of seeing Ken Livingstone, whom he opposed, become London's first elected mayor.</p>

        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: MURDER INQUIRY SOUGHT  The Human Rights Commission, a watchdog group set up under the April 1998 Ulster peace accord, dismissed as insufficient a police investigation of the murder of a prominent Catholic rights lawyer, Pat Finucane, and called for an independent inquiry. A Protestant paramilitary group claimed responsibility for the 1989 murder, but the family and civil liberties groups say they have evidence of collusion between the killers and the Royal Ulster Constabulary.</p>

        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: ARMY PULLBACK  British Army bases in Londonderry and South Armagh and a military camp close to the Irish border are to be closed, and several observation towers in Belfast are to be dismantled, said Sir Ronnie Flanagan, chief of the Royal Ulster Constabulary. The steps follow an announcement by the Irish Republican Army permitting international inspection of its secret arms dumps.</p>

        <p>GERMANY: 3 EX-COMMUNISTS CHARGED  Three former members of East Germany's Politburo went on trial for manslaughter in the shooting deaths of four people trying to flee across the Berlin Wall between 1984 and 1989. Herbert Haber, 69, Hans-Joachim Bohme, 70, and Siegfried Lorenz, 69, are accused of not speaking out in the Politburo against the killings of people trying to escape to the West.</p>

        <p>ITALY: BERLUSCONI WINS  A Milan appeals court overturned a bribery conviction against Silvio Berlusconi, a media tycoon and leader of the center-left opposition. Mr. Berlusconi, whose victory in regional elections drove former Prime Minister Massimo d'Alema to resign, was cleared on one of four bribery counts. The court overturned three others because the statute of limitations had elapsed. He still faces trials on other charges of bribery and false accounting.</p>

        <p>FRANCE: MORE MAD COW DISEASE  Officials announced that they had detected yet another case of mad cow disease, this time in the northwest Manche region. The cow and a herd of 141 other cattle were slaughtered and burned. The new case brought to 17 the number of new cases discovered this year, suggesting that France is on the way to far exceed last year's total of 30 cases.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: STRIKE HITS ENROLLMENT  The number of high school graduates seeking admission to the Autonomous National University, Mexico's most important institution of higher learning, has plummeted in the wake of a student strike that paralyzed the campus for nearly a year. Before the strike began last spring, 78,000 students took the entrance examination. After the strike ended this spring, only 41,000 applicants took the same test.</p>

        <p>SOUTH AFRICA: MOVE TO LEGALIZE PROSTITUTION  A proposed law legalizing prostitution is in the final stages of preparation after months of study by the Law Commission, a government advisory and research body. Prostitution, while illegal, is hardly ever prosecuted, and advocates for sex workers have been lobbying for the change, saying it would make the industry safer for prostitutes and their patrons. The law commission expects to have a draft ready for public comment by September, but any change in the law would have to be approved by Parliament.</p>

        <p>ASIA</p>
        <p>PHILIPPINES: EX-NATO CHIEF ARRIVES  Javier Solana, the former NATO secretary general, arrived in Manila representing European nations concerned over the welfare of 10 mostly European hostages being held by Muslim separatists. Mr. Solana said he was there to observe and offer support, not to negotiate.</p>
        <p>Seth Mydans (NYT)</p>
        <p>CHINA: PLEA ON TORTURE  China has been urged by a United Nations body in Geneva to investigate allegations of torture and to take steps to ensure such acts are punished. The United Nations Committee Against Torture also urged China to end administrative detentions, in which inmates lack legal protection.</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: NO SURRENDER  A day after Sri Lanka rejected a cease-fire offer from the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, Deputy Defense Minister Anuruddha Ratwatte told Parliament, ''We will never give Jaffna to L.T.T.E.'' The Tigers have taken two crucial army bases since April 22 in their quest to control the northern Jaffna Peninsula. General Ratwatte, above, said 358 soldiers had been killed and 349 are missing in action in the recent battles.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: SELF-APPRAISAL  Israelis believe the typical Israeli to be characterized by chutzpah, ''directness without politeness,'' materialism and loudness, according to a poll by the newspaper Yediot Ahronot. But only 20 percent of those surveyed said they considered themselves typical. The newspaper also found that while half the Jewish population consider themselves ''very Zionist,'' some 20 percent -- mostly young people -- do not consider themselves Zionist at all.</p>

        <p>Correction:  May 22, 2000, Monday  A report in the World Briefing column on May 10 about the overturning of a bribery conviction of the Italian politician Silvio Berlusconi misstated his coalition's political stance. It is center-right, not center-left.</p>
