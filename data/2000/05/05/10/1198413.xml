      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article in Business Day on May 2 about a strike by actors in television and radio commercials misspelled one striker's surname and referred incorrectly to his comments about the pay disparity between cable and network television. The actor is Frank Simons, not Simmons. He said he would have earned $40,000 if his commercial had run as often on the networks as on cable. He did not say that that occurred.</p>
