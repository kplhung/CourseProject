        <p>The flaws in the United Nations peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone reach back to the rush to end the civil war and send in an international force to patch together what some call ''peace on the cheap.''</p>
        <p>In the tumult today, the tide was turning toward a restoration of regional peacekeepers. But the formula reached last year, which the Clinton administration helped forge with assistance from the Rev. Jesse Jackson, was supposed to work quite differently.</p>
        <p>The rebel leader, Foday Sankoh, was released from death row and given a prominent role in a new government on the understanding that his men would put down their weapons in a setting with United Nations peacekeepers.</p>
        <p>But the administration, haunted by the memory of 18 American soldiers killed in Somalia on a United Nations mission, and mindful of 14 Belgians slain in Rwanda, made it clear to Congress that it would not send American forces to Africa again.</p>
        <p>Britain, the former colonial power in Sierra Leone, similarly did not offer to send in troops as peacekeepers there. Nor did or any other European country.</p>
        <p>Washington also repeatedly told African leaders that although the United States was not prepared to risk its own people in Africa, it cared about the troubled continent.</p>
        <p>A peacekeeping force was formed from a hodgepodge of nations whose armies had never worked together and who were given minimal equipment.</p>
        <p>The Security Council also did not give the peacekeeping force the means to patrol Sierra Leone's borders, through which, according to experts on Africa, the rebels could continue trading diamonds for arms.</p>
        <p>The troops' mission was essentially to police a peace agreement and not to plunge into the fray. The problem was that they were sent to monitor a peace that officials now say existed basically only on paper.</p>
        <p>When the arrangements started to collapse, Britain sent 700 to 800 paratroopers to the airport at Freetown on Monday, but insisted that they had the sole task of evacuating foreigners, while the United States announced that it would help transport 700 Bangladeshi soldiers.</p>
        <p>Administration officials now say that Mr. Sankoh was never interested in peace -- although they had enough trust in him for Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright to meet him when she visited the country last October.</p>
        <p>The United Nations peacekeeping department itself has already been going through a series of inquiries after the world organization failed to stop mass killings in Rwanda and to halt the killing of Muslims in the Bosnian town of Srebrenica in 1995.</p>
        <p>''Robust peace enforcement is beyond the capacity of the United Nations,'' said J. Stephen Morrison, the director of Africa programs at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''The Security Council does not have the stomach for it, contributing countries don't want to put their troops under other commanders and then have to answer questions at home when their troops get killed.''</p>
        <p>By backing such a weak force in a volatile country like Sierra Leone, Mr. Morrison said, the Clinton administration was hoping for ''peace on the cheap.''</p>
        <p>The debate within the administration and among other members of the Security Council is now focusing on whether to reinforce the crippled United Nations force in Sierra Leone or to turn to a regional one led by the Nigerians, administration officials said today.</p>
        <p>After a meeting today in Abuja, the Nigerian capital, the leaders of nine African states said they were considering deploying  a West African force known as Ecomog to be led by the Nigerians.</p>
        <p>An administration official said tonight that it was likely that the Nigerians would deploy a battalion -- about 700 men -- in the next several days. Those troops would be backed by a battalion formed by troops from Ghana and Guinea, the official said.</p>
        <p>Whether those troops would be come under the command of the United Nations was up to the three countries and the United Nations, the official said. ''We want this to be an effective force,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Chester Crocker, a former assistant secretary of state for African affairs, said, ''If someone was willing to finance the Nigerians, it would work.''</p>
        <p>Jordan, which is scheduled to send a full battalion, was ready to send about 300 special forces by the weekend as well. The administration is prepared to airlift any of these forces, the administration official said.</p>
        <p>Such an international force had been in Sierra Leone before the accord of last July, and if it returns it would be a signal that regional forces are viewed as better suited to enforcing the peace than inexperienced United Nations troops, several administration officials said.</p>
        <p>The logic of regional forces, according to administration officials, is that each region looks after its own trouble spots. Thus, NATO intervened in Bosnia and Kosovo, the Australians went to Timor last year and the West Africans may be poised to enforce the peace in Sierra Leone.</p>
        <p>Nigeria, with its experience in Sierra Leone, was considered crucial to a solution there.</p>
        <p>But after Nigerian soldiers suffered casualties and were nearly defeated in January 1999, the Nigerian government decided to pull out if it did not win increased financial support, an administration official said. The Americans and the British were reluctant to do so.</p>
        <p>And later Nigeria said it did not want its troops to serve under United Nations commanders.</p>
        <p>The bulk of the Nigerian troops left by early last week, the moment when administration officials now say Mr. Sankoh's forces decided to test the will of the United Nations force by taking Kenyan and Zambian soldiers hostage.</p>
        <p>When the rebels struck, the United Nations force was still 3,000 soldiers short of the full 11,000 complement set up in February. Recruiting non-African countries to send their soldiers was particularly difficult, with the Indians, the Bangladeshis and the Jordanians the main non-African countries to offer men.</p>
        <p>United Nations troops started arriving early this year, six months after the peace accord was signed.</p>
        <p>Afterward, the Indian commander of the force, Gen. Veejay Jatley, told administration officials that the United Nations was so chaotic that he did not know what troops were coming or which country they were coming from until they arrived, one of the officials said.</p>
        <p>The peacekeepers were often intimidated, surrounded by rebels and, according to Human Rights Watch, did not intervene to stop rapes, abductions and killings.</p>
        <p>As the situation deteriorated last week,  Koffi Annan, the United Nations Secretary General, floated the idea of a rapid reaction force. There were no applicants from any of the major Western powers.</p>
        <p>When the notion was discussed inside the administration, according to one participant, the argument was straightforward: ''What is the United States national interest in Sierra Leone? There aren't any, other than humanitarian interests.''</p>
        <p>So, the official said, the administration favored countries of the region sending troops in because their national interests were at stake, not those of the United States.</p>
