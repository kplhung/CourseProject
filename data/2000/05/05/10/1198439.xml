        <p>CONKLING - Sylvia Alexander, born on September 5, 1920, daughter of the late Edward Renick Alexander, a patent attorney, and the late Elise Hoban Alexander of Cleveland, OH, Washington, DC, and East Hampton, NY, died on the evening of May 7, 2000 at New York United Hospital in Port Chester, NY. The cause of death was acute respiratory failure. Mrs. Conkling was the great, great granddaughter of James Hoban, the designer and architect of The White House in Washington, DC. She graduated from The Convent of the Sacred Heart in Washington, DC in 1938, and shortly thereafter made her debut in that city. She was a member of the nursing organization known as The Gray Ladies during WWII, and a long time member of The Junior League. In 1947, in East Hampton, Miss Alexander married Robert Leslie Conkling, former Lieutenant (D), USNR, and later a senior partner of the Bleakley, Platt, Schmidt, &amp; Fritz law firm in New York City, and lived for the last 46 years in Larchmont, NY, where she was active in local organizations and worked for many years in various caregiving capacities. Mrs. Conkling is survived by her husband and their six children, Robert, Peter, Christopher, John, James, and Elise; as well as four grandchildren and one great granddaughter. A Mass of Christian Burial will be celebrated on Thursday, May 11, 2000 at 10 A.M. at St. Augustine's Church in Larchmont, NY, to be followed by interment at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, NY. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests that donations to the ASPCA, United Cerebral Palsy, The Veterans of Foreigh Wars of the United States, or Saint Stephens Indian Mission Foundations, Inc. be considered.</p>
