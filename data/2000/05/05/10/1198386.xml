        <p>Last year, Jim Courier leaned against a wall in one of the tunnels beneath Melbourne Park during the Australian Open and said that ''when I feel no longer capable of winning a major, I'll pull the plug.''</p>
        <p>Courier pulled it on Monday, announcing his retirement from the men's tennis tour after 13 years, two Australian Open titles, two French Open titles, two Davis Cup team championships and nearly as much self-improvement as asset-improvement, which is quite a compliment to his restless if untrained intellect.</p>
        <p>In truth, it was clear long before Monday that Courier, who is 29, was not going to win another Grand Slam tournament. Although 1999, his last full season, was one of resurgence, the last time he reached a semifinal at a Grand Slam event was in 1995 at the United States Open. The last time he reached a final was at Wimbledon in 1993, which was also the last time he was ranked No. 1 in the world.</p>
        <p>But Courier, who spent a total of 58 weeks in the top spot, needed more time and many more tight and exhausting matches to let go of his dogged pursuit of perfection.</p>
        <p>''A wise man once told me, 'When you wake up and don't want to get better at tennis, it's time to stop,' '' he told USA Today. ''That day has been around for most of this year.''</p>
        <p>It must be difficult to accept that you have peaked at 22; difficult to accept that despite all your intensity and ambition and strength, those with more ability and more infallible technique are going to remain your superiors. And what must have made the psychological hurdles all the harder for Courier was that his foremost superiors, Pete Sampras and his former Bollettieri Academy practice partner, Andre Agassi, had been his boyhood rivals.</p>
        <p>Together with Michael Chang and, to a lesser degree, Todd Martin, they formed one of the finest generations of American players since the postwar wave that included Jack Kramer, Pancho Gonzalez and Tony Trabert. Courier, the first of his peer group to retire, amassed $14 million in prize money and twice that much in sponsorship revenue.</p>
        <p>No small accomplishment for a high school graduate from Dade City, Fla. (''Dead City,'' as Courier occasionally and affectionately referred to it).</p>
        <p>Courier broke through at the French Open in 1991: one year after Sampras had won the United States Open and two years after Chang had won the French. Courier beat Agassi in five rain-interrupted sets on clay. He did it the way he would come to dominate the international tour: with controlled power from the baseline, particularly off the forehand, well-placed serves and an indefatigable standard of preparation and fitness.</p>
        <p>In Paris, Courier, with the help of a tongue-lashing from his coach, Brad Stine, stopped fighting himself, stopped responding immaturely to the pressure of trying to reach the top. Courier listened and outlasted Agassi for his first major, but it would take him time to grow into his role as a spokesman and a star.</p>
        <p>Nicknamed the Rock for his mental strength on court, Courier acknowledged that he was moody: ''I like roller coasters,'' he once said. In his prickly moments, he could be selfish and insensitive, but over the long haul Courier stood out for his sardonic wit and innate curiosity.</p>
        <p>To his credit, if not always his athletic benefit, Courier enjoyed exploring the wider world. In Europe, he learned where the monuments were and what they meant. He practiced hard on the drums and his guitars. He read widely and learned passable French, which led to a memorable speech at Roland Garros in 1993.</p>
        <p>After the young Spanish baseliner Sergi Bruguera had beaten him to keep him from winning a third straight French Open, Courier leaped the net and lifted Bruguera off the clay and then charmed the fans by apologizing in colloquial French for speaking like ''une vache Espagnole'' (a Spanish cow) and then complimenting the ''vache Espagnole'' (nasty Spaniard) who had beaten him.</p>
        <p>His worldliness was not always as charming. At the ATP Tour Championships in late 1993, he started reading Armistead Maupin's novel, ''Maybe the Moon,'' on change-overs and wilted during points. The crack in his mental toughness on court eventually appeared in his formidable physique as well. A chronically sore right bicep ruined his season in 1997 and drove him to the brink of retirement the next summer.</p>
        <p>''To tell you the truth, I've been thinking about retirement since I was 23,'' he said at the time. ''At that point, I was either going to fix the arm or find something else to occupy my time.''</p>
        <p>Now, after doing television commentary for TNT at Wimbledon this year, he will move beyond tennis for satisfaction. After all, he has always said, ''Life's too interesting to limit yourself to tennis.''</p>
