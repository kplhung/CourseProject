        <p>BARRY-Kevin. On May 7, 2000, at 747 months (62+ years). Much loved husband of Joan Ohlson, suportive son of Kathleen Barry, caring father of Kevin, Dianna (Speranza), Garrett and Darren, respected brother of Jim, Kim, and Steve, and proud grandfather of Aleah, Jimmy, Brian, Devin, Nikolas. We will miss his agile mind and challenging discussions, his honesty and warmth, his strength and dynamism, his ability to be himself. Memorial Service at Hudson Guild, 441 West 26th Street, on May 12th, at 1 P.M. In lieu of flowers, contributions can be made to Hudson Guild or American Cancer Society.</p>
        <p>BARRY-Kevin. It is with sorrow that the Board of Trustees and Staff of Urban Pathways, Inc. record the death of Kevin Barry, the husband of our esteemed Executive Director Joan E. Ohlson. We extend heartfelt sympathy to Joan and to Kevin's entire family. Gary Belsky, President Peter Yee, Associate Executive Director</p>
