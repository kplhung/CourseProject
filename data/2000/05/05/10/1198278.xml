      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Because of an editing error, the recipe with the Chef column last Wednesday, about an alternative to classic risotto, misstated the amount of grape seed oil to be used in Steps 4 and 5. In Step 4, two tablespoons should be used; in Step 5, three tablespoons. The corrected recipe is below.</p>
        <p>SEARED SCALLOPS ON BLACK OLIVE RISOTTO CAKES  Time: 45 minutes, plus 7 hours' chilling</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons unsalted butter  3 medium shallots, minced  1 cup arborio rice  3 1/2 cups chicken stock  Salt and cayenne pepper to taste</p>
        <p>1/3 cup grated Parmesan</p>
        <p>1/2 cup pitted and chopped Nicoise olives  Flour  5 tablespoons grape seed oil  16 medium sea scallops (about 1 pound), tendons removed  Basil-infused olive oil.</p>
        <p>1. Melt butter in a large saucepan. Add shallots and cook over medium heat until translucent, about 4 minutes. Stir in rice and cook, stirring constantly, until grains are coated with fat, about 2 minutes. Stir in stock, salt and cayenne to taste and half the Parmesan. Bring to a boil, and reduce heat. Cover, and simmer until rice is creamy, 17 minutes. Uncover, and stir rice vigorously. Add olives and remaining cheese, and stir until any remaining liquid cooks off.</p>
        <p>2. Scrape rice into a 9-inch-square pan lined with parchment. Rap pan against counter to level rice. Cool to room temperature, about an hour. Cover, and refrigerate until firm and chilled, at least 6 hours.</p>
        <p>3. Heat oven to 400 degrees. Use a 3 1/2-inch biscuit cutter to punch 4 disks out of cooled rice. (Scraps can be reworked and used to make an extra disk.) Lightly dust rice cakes with flour.</p>
        <p>4. Heat 2 tablespoons grape seed oil in a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Slide cakes, smooth side down, into hot pan. Cook until crisp and well browned on bottom, about 3 minutes. Flip cakes over, and transfer pan to rack in center of oven. Bake until second side is crisp and well browned, about 7 minutes.</p>
        <p>5. When rice cakes are in the oven, season scallops with salt and cayenne. Heat remaining grape seed oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add scallops, and reduce heat to medium-high. Cook until bottoms are golden brown, about 2 minutes. Turn with tongs, and cook until second side is golden, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes. Transfer scallops to a platter lined with a paper towel.</p>
        <p>6. When rice cakes are golden brown, transfer them to a platter lined with a paper towel. Place one rice cake, bumpy side up, on each plate. Stack four scallops in a pyramid on each cake. Drizzle a few drops of basil oil on each plate, and serve.  Yield: 4 servings.</p>
