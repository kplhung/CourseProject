        <p>Peter Thompson, an actor on stage and in film who later taught drama for more than 20 years, died on April 24 at New York Hospital in Manhattan. He was 65 and lived in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The cause was complications from heart surgery, said Robert Cosenza, his companion.</p>
        <p>An Oklahoma native with boyish good looks, Mr. Thompson studied theater at the University of Oklahoma and later migrated to New York.</p>
        <p>His most fruitful years onstage came in the early 1970's as a member of the American Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Conn. In three seasons there he played several major roles, including Cassio in ''Othello,'' with Moses Gunn, which moved to Broadway; and Bertram in ''All's Well That Ends Well.'' In 1971 he appeared in O'Neill's ''Mourning Becomes Electra,'' opposite Sada Thompson and Jane Alexander.</p>
        <p>By then Mr. Thompson had also begun to dabble in directing, staging productions like ''Slow Dance on the Killing Ground'' and ''You Can't Take It With You'' in Atlanta. In 1976 he received favorable reviews for his direction of ''Lemon Sky,'' by Lanford Wilson, at the Westside Theater in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>That same year he began teaching acting and scene study at Michael Howard Studios in Manhattan, where he once trained. Mr. Thompson also taught at the Circle in the Square acting program, in affiliation with New York University.</p>
        <p>In addition to Mr. Cosenza, Mr. Thompson is survived by a brother, William, of Oklahoma City.</p>
