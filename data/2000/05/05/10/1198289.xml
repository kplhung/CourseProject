        <p>There is a reason comedians always give three examples to make a point, says the performance artist Holly Hughes. ''Things are funny in threes,'' she explains. ''The father, the son, the Holy Ghost. The executive, the legislative, the judicial.''</p>
        <p>That is the most shocking thing Ms. Hughes says in ''Preaching to the Perverted.'' Unless you're upset by her referring to the nine Supreme Court justices as the Supremes and representing them with nine little yellow ducks perched on the edge of an open cardboard box.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hughes, who performs her act in a crisp white cotton shirt and cropped black pants, has had her problems with the Supreme Court. She spells them out in this solid, funny performance piece with peaks of insight. She will forever be known as one of the N.E.A. Four, artists who had their grants revoked by the National Endowment for the Arts in 1990 because they offended ''standards of decency.'' And she illustrates her feelings about that at the beginning of the show by having a disembodied male voice say ''N.E.A. Four'' over and over while she pulls out a gun and shoots in the voice's direction. That shuts him up. (The N.E.A. Other Three -- Karen Finley, John Fleck and Tim Miller -- may want to consider similar symbolic action.)</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the case is her show. (The grants were reinstated, the government appealed, and in 1998 the Supreme Court ruled against the artists.) Lenny Bruce lost face, ground and fans when he turned his stand-up act into a tirade about his legal battles against censorship. Ms. Hughes, far more wisely, keeps it entertaining.</p>
        <p>She experiences the Supreme Court as a collective parental figure, a frightening one that is punishing her for being naughty. Her first surprise, however, is that she needs to get a ticket, and they're in great demand for this particular hearing. ''Who knew there were tickets to go to the Supreme Court?'' she says. Someone asks her: ''What do you need tickets for? I thought you were in it.''</p>
        <p>Not really. There are no witnesses, just the lawyers for the two sides making their arguments and taking questions from the bench. There are Secret Service agents all around. There is a sign that decrees ''It is forbidden to adjust the microphone,'' she says. And there is a rule about complete silence. ''No talking during the show. Trial. Show trial,'' she says. Point made.</p>
        <p>When Ms. Hughes isn't describing the court experience, she is wondering aloud just what it is that makes her being a lesbian so threatening to society. She brings up the Defense of Marriage Act, which denies federal recognition of same-sex marriages (''Do straight people feel safer now?''), and wonders how gay people can be out to destroy the American family since ''there's nothing left of the American family'' to destroy. Reflecting on her childhood in Michigan, she recalls her father's relationship to the rest of the family: ''Every night he crawled out of the woods to eat what we set out for him.'' Being a lesbian must mean, she decides, having ''an enlarged hypothalamus, which secretes special rights.''</p>
        <p>People did look at her a little strangely when her purse was searched once by a security guard and a disheveled Beanie Baby turned up. ''I am no pedophile,'' she says, fearful that people will think she uses the Beanie Baby to lure little girls in the park. ''In fact I am a bit of a pedophobe.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hughes does use props well: a few large cardboard boxes; a bouquet of tiny American flags, which she discards one by one; a larger flag, which is America's but with the colors of the gay rights rainbow flag in place of the red-and-white stripes; a hideous rainbow wig; a vibrator; glitter and confetti; the lavender Teletubby.</p>
        <p>They are all used in the service of a message that she is, as her title suggests, delivering to audiences who already agree with her. Who are horrified, as she is, to realize that freedom of speech, which allows Americans to burn the flag, doesn't necessarily apply to government grants to gay artists. Who are angry with President Clinton. But Ms. Hughes says she has begun to feel some sympathy for Mr. Clinton, especially after the Monica Lewinsky scandal. Now she can see the president as ''a man who got into trouble because he liked the wrong kind of sex too much.''</p>
        <p>''Preaching to the Perverted,'' ably directed by Lois Weaver at Performance Space 122 in the East Village, continues through May 21.</p>
        <p>PREACHING TO THE PERVERTED  Written and performed by Holly Hughes; director and dramaturge, Lois Weaver; sound by Vivian Stoll; assistant director, Darren Katz; lighting by Frank Den Danto III; board operator, Katy McDermott.
