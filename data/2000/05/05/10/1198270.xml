        <p>OPENING a bottle of wine usually entails lots of tugging at a stubborn cork that often breaks in the process. It's not surprising, considering that the standard corkscrew design (a metal worm that hooks the cork, attached to a handle to tug on) hasn't really changed in 300 years.</p>
        <p>One great innovation was the Screwpull lever-action corkscrew, introduced in the 1980's, which could be clamped onto a bottle to prize out the cork. And now there is the Rabbit, a foolproof device that could almost be the Screwpull crossed with an OXO Good Grips gadget. And it's much less expensive than a comparable Screwpull.</p>

        <p>OPENING a bottle of wine usually entails lots of tugging at a stubborn cork that often breaks in the process. It's not surprising, considering that the standard corkscrew design (a metal worm that hooks the cork, attached to a handle to tug on) hasn't really changed in 300 years.</p>
        <p>One great innovation was the Screwpull lever-action corkscrew, introduced in the 1980's, which could be clamped onto a bottle to prize out the cork. And now there is the Rabbit, a foolproof device that could almost be the Screwpull crossed with an OXO Good Grips gadget. And it's much less expensive than a comparable Screwpull.</p>
        <p>The Rabbit, which looks like its name, clamps onto the neck of a wine bottle to insert the worm directly into the center of the cork. Then, with a gentle pull of the lever, the cork pops out almost instantly.  The device works only if the worm is inserted properly, which means it never mangles or breaks a cork. It works equally well on the plastic or rubber corks that are usually much harder to extract. And it can eject the cork off the worm once the bottle is open.</p>
        <p>The mechanism itself is much the same as the Screwpull's lever model, said Riki Kane, an owner of Metrokane, which makes the Rabbit. ''We've waited 17 years for Screwpull's lever-style corkscrew patent to expire,'' she said. The designer, Ed Killduff, used cushy rubber on the handles and lever, making the corkscrew more comfortable to use.</p>
        <p>''We tested it with all size hands and even with people who had problems with their hands,'' he said. ''We found that everyone can use this model comfortably.''</p>

        <p>The Rabbit is $69.95 and comes with a foil cutter at Sherry-Lehman, 679 Madison Avenue (61st Street) or www.sherry-lehman.com.</p>
