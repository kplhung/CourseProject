        <p>On the tense opening day of what may be the final debate over flying the Confederate battle flag on the Statehouse dome, an all-white majority of the South Carolina House of Representatives appeared to be willing to accept a compromise that would move the flag to a Confederate monument in front of the Capitol.</p>
        <p>The final vote on the proposal, which passed the State Senate last month, will probably come on Wednesday. But in a preliminary vote, 72 of the 120 House members accepted an amendment that would move a smaller version of the flag on July 1 to a pole in front of the Capitol's main entrance. Supporters of the flag, all but 11 of whom were white Republicans, succeeded in passing the amendment, which would make the flag more prominent, raising the size of the pole to 30 feet from the 20 feet proposed by the Senate. Another amendment passed today provides for illuminating it at night.</p>

        <p>On the tense opening day of what may be the final debate over flying the Confederate battle flag on the Statehouse dome, an all-white majority of the South Carolina House of Representatives appeared to be willing to accept a compromise that would move the flag to a Confederate monument in front of the Capitol.</p>
        <p>The final vote on the proposal, which passed the State Senate last month, will probably come on Wednesday. But in a preliminary vote, 72 of the 120 House members accepted an amendment that would move a smaller version of the flag on July 1 to a pole in front of the Capitol's main entrance. Supporters of the flag, all but 11 of whom were white Republicans, succeeded in passing the amendment, which would make the flag more prominent, raising the size of the pole to 30 feet from the 20 feet proposed by the Senate. Another amendment passed today provides for illuminating it at night.</p>
        <p>But in a sign of the body's deep racial divisions, none of the House's 26 black members supported the amendments. Many black members already opposed the Senate's proposal, saying that it kept the Confederate flag in a position of prominence, and were even more vehemently against the idea of making the flagpole taller and lighting it up. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which is conducting an economic boycott of the state, also opposes the plan to move the flag to the Confederate Soldier's monument.</p>
        <p>Black members, joined by many white Democrats, did support two plans that were voted down by the majority: one to put a bronze relief of the flag on a granite slab near the monument, and the other to fly the flag on an ''avenue of flags'' adjacent to the Capitol along with other flags that have flown over South Carolina.</p>
        <p>White supporters denounced the bronze-relief plan as an ''insult'' to their heritage, and mustered the votes to defeat it, 65 to 43.</p>
        <p>''The Civil War was a big part of the history of the state, not a small part, but huge,'' said Representative William F. Cotty, a Republican from Columbia. ''But this tombstone monument type of bill, you might as well lower it down and give it perpetual care. You're saying, 'Bury that baby, get rid of it.' '' About 40 white members were opposed to moving the flag at all, and one member, Representative John Milton Knotts Jr. of West Columbia, said he would prefer that the Confederate flag fly above the United States and South Carolina flags.</p>
        <p>Black legislators, all of whom are Democrats, said it was clear that the Republican leadership of the House was doing everything possible to make the flag extremely prominent once it came down from the dome, making the entire exercise of moving it essentially meaningless. They said that putting a symbol of slavery at the entrance to the Capitol was nearly as offensive as flying it on high.</p>
        <p>''They voted down every suggestion we made to put it in historical context, and they're just trying to ram it down our throats,'' said Representative J. Todd Rutherford of Columbia. ''If they try to pass this without any of our votes tomorrow, it will once again be a case of the great white fathers knowing what's best for the African-Americans of this state.''</p>
        <p>Speaker David H. Wilkins, a Republican, said it appeared that the House was moving toward the 30-foot-flagpole provision, which he supported. But Mr. Wilkins said Republicans in the House would not bear all the weight of moving the flag; they will not support it in a final vote if Democrats, and particularly black members, remain opposed, he said.</p>
