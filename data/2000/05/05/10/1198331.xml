        <p>Editorial on marital woes as factor in Senate race between Hillary Clinton and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani; predicts mainstream press will respect Mayor Rudolph W Giuliani request for privacy about his relationship with wife, Donna Hanover, and friend, Judith Nathan; holds voters have right to commentary to help them evaluate candidate's judgment and temperament; sees Giuliani losing some support among cultural and religious conservatives already antagonistic to Clinton</p>

        <p>Despite their many differences, New York's Senate candidates, Rudolph Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton, hold at least one belief in common. Both assert that there should be what Mrs. Clinton calls a ''zone of privacy'' around the personal lives of elected officials and their families. Both, it seems, also have a talent for stirring public curiosity about their inner lives and an inclination to accuse the media of pursuing information for which the public has no real appetite.</p>
        <p>What the public finally decides about this Gothic novel of an election and these two fascinating, highly polarizing personalities is the key question, of course. Assuming, as everyone hopes, that Mr. Giuliani's health allows for a full campaign, the answer is seven months away. Our guess is that in the interim the non-tabloid press will respect the request for privacy from Mayor Giuliani and not go in search of further information about him, his wife, Donna Hanover, or his friend Judith Nathan. Notwithstanding the complaints of President Clinton's defenders about shifting standards of privacy, the mainstream press has never been quick to carry information about politicians' personal conduct unless that information issued from official sources or seemed related to officeholders' fulfilling of their public obligations.</p>

        <p>What the public finally decides about this Gothic novel of an election and these two fascinating, highly polarizing personalities is the key question, of course. Assuming, as everyone hopes, that Mr. Giuliani's health allows for a full campaign, the answer is seven months away. Our guess is that in the interim the non-tabloid press will respect the request for privacy from Mayor Giuliani and not go in search of further information about him, his wife, Donna Hanover, or his friend Judith Nathan. Notwithstanding the complaints of President Clinton's defenders about shifting standards of privacy, the mainstream press has never been quick to carry information about politicians' personal conduct unless that information issued from official sources or seemed related to officeholders' fulfilling of their public obligations.</p>
        <p>But candidates cannot expect journalists, strategists or voters to be brain-dead when it comes to analyzing the political impact of the full public record. In the current United States Senate campaign, that record includes the candidates' comments, in press conferences and interviews, about their marriages and, in Mr. Giuliani's case, social engagements that occurred in public view. In New York's chaotic information environment, the record also includes paparazzi photos, gossip columns and tabloid news, and this fact poses a special challenge for journalists who are commenting on the campaign. Like it or not, voters have a right to reach conclusions about a candidate's judgment and temperament based on what they learn from a variety of sources about the person's life. They also have a right to commentary that sorts through what is central and what is peripheral to the task of electing a leader.</p>
        <p>In New York, such judgments cannot ignore  local history. This state has the widest strike zone in American politics when it comes to candidates' private lives and domestic arrangements. Gov. Nelson Rockefeller's re-election in 1962 after a very public divorce testifies to that fact. While Mrs. Clinton's and Mr. Giuliani's stories are very different, they may now be on something like an equal footing in regard to drawing on that tradition of tolerance. Early polls showed that Mrs. Clinton had suffered among professional women for being perceived as too tolerant of a misbehaving husband. But the issue of marital balance may be neutralized, especially if the mayor is perceived as the less sympathetic partner in his family arrangement.</p>
        <p>Also, no one knows how deeply the tradition of tolerance runs among voters who identify themselves as cultural and religious conservatives. Mrs. Clinton has been anathema to many of them. Mr. Giuliani could now face slippage in sectors of that  coalition -- for example, Catholics, Orthodox Jews, upstate independents -- where he had expected an advantage. While a Daily News poll showed that 77 percent of those contacted viewed Mr. Giuliani's friendship with Ms. Nathan as a private matter, 12 percent said they viewed him more negatively. In a close election, fractional shifts can be decisive.</p>
        <p>If these factors seem to tip in Mrs. Clinton's favor, it may be simply a matter of her difficult news being out earlier. And Ms. Hanover's statement on the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral about ''decisions'' to come could portend additional headlines for Mr. Giuliani. But the mayor, for his part, seems confident that the Clintonian privacy zone will work in his favor, or else he would not have used his daringly transparent description of Ms. Nathan as a ''very good friend.'' That ''very'' could become the most famous adverb in a campaign that, if it keeps running at this pace, will be remembered as a Rorschach test of contemporary New York attitudes toward candidates, their private lives and their public marriages.</p>
