        <p>It may be hard to believe but American Ballet Theater is 60 years old, a milestone celebrated at the anniversary gala that opened the company's two-month season on Monday night. It was an event that married past and present and looked to the future. ''Variations on a Theme by Haydn,'' a subtle, formal and rich ballet that Twyla Tharp has set to music by Brahms, received its New York premiere.</p>
        <p>This look toward new creativity was balanced during the evening at the Metropolitan Opera House by excerpts from the repertory and some surprise guests, notably Alicia Alonso, the Cuban ballerina who was one of Ballet Theater's earliest stars in the 1940's.</p>

        <p>It may be hard to believe but American Ballet Theater is 60 years old, a milestone celebrated at the anniversary gala that opened the company's two-month season on Monday night. It was an event that married past and present and looked to the future. ''Variations on a Theme by Haydn,'' a subtle, formal and rich ballet that Twyla Tharp has set to music by Brahms, received its New York premiere.</p>
        <p>This look toward new creativity was balanced during the evening at the Metropolitan Opera House by excerpts from the repertory and some surprise guests, notably Alicia Alonso, the Cuban ballerina who was one of Ballet Theater's earliest stars in the 1940's.</p>
        <p>Tipper Gore, who was honorary chairman of the gala with Vice President Al Gore (not present), was introduced by Caroline Kennedy and Senator Charles Schumer of New York, who were introduced at the start by Hamilton James, chairman of the company's board.</p>
        <p>Like Ms. Kennedy, Senator Schumer urged strong support for the arts. Mrs. Gore offered her variation on the theme, broadening it into an appreciation of ''the arts as part of our national heritage.'' ''Swan Lake,'' in a new staging by Kevin McKenzie, the company's artistic director, was represented by an excerpt from Act II and started the dancing on the program.</p>
        <p>Company alumni made their appearance at the first intermission: Donald Saddler, Miriam Golden and Annabelle Lyon had all danced at Ballet Theater's debut in New York on Jan. 11, 1940, and took a bow. Mr. Saddler, a choreographer and director in ballet and on Broadway, paid tribute to Richard Pleasant, Ballet Theater's founding director, and to Lucia Chase, the company's founding patron and later co-director with Oliver Smith from 1945 to 1980.</p>
        <p>In her remarks, Ms. Alonso said, ''This was the first big classical company in the United States and it was wonderful, we were all together.'' Speaking of pioneering years for both the dancers and the audience, she concluded, ''The most beautiful way to unite people is through art.''</p>
        <p>Unity of a new sort was signaled when Mr. McKenzie stepped on stage at the end of the evening to read a message from Mikhail Baryshnikov, who withdrew all his productions from the company after he resigned as its artistic director in 1989. Mr. Baryshnikov, who has kept his distance from the troupe, sent his best wishes ''in honor of Lucia Chase and Oliver Smith.''</p>
        <p>In his own remarks, Mr. McKenzie said, ''Sixty is too young to be old and too old to be young.'' By past standards, it was a sober and simple gala, keeping reminiscences and alumni to the minimum. Nonetheless there was a festive close in a mass curtain call. Gold and silver balloons rained down on the entire company and on the guests, who included the British-born star Frederic Franklin.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tharp's ballet deserves special attention not only because of its novelty but also because the rest of the familiar program was unevenly danced. Terrific is the word for the men, who blended style, artistry and virtuosity. With a few exceptions the women were atypically off form.</p>
        <p>With 30 dancers, ''Variations on a Theme by Haydn'' is a big ballet despite its relative brevity. Ms. Tharp keeps to the classical vocabulary more than usual, with only a few quirky weight shifts playing off ballet's centered positions.</p>
        <p>Above all, she has added her own sophisticated dimension to the music, reflecting its emotional essence and classical form. This is a ballet that perpetually retracts and expands, swelling into an intense and frontal advance by the dancers that corresponds to Brahms's grand finale.</p>
        <p>The changing patterns reflect the musical theme's celebrated structure (AABB) and counterpoint, but there is too much going on at once to view the ballet as a literal visualization of the score.</p>
        <p>Ms. Tharp tends to sacrifice details to a larger pattern. But strict clarity is not the issue. The choreography makes each of the nine variations an adventure: Each is unpredictable, impelled by the energy that drives the entire ballet.</p>
        <p>It is a plotless work with dance as its subject and yet there are episodes that imply courtships and a chase scene. The big lifts are obvious, and  the counterpoint in the choreography is present in the contrasts among the five main couples and two pairs of soloists, not just in the interaction of the principals and the ensemble, often divided into units of four or eight pairs.</p>
        <p>Santo Loquasto's tunics and tights nonetheless color code the corps in light green and the principals in tan. Jennifer Tipton's lighting design is as fine as usual.</p>
        <p>Three couples stand out in the beginning, but it isn't long before Susan Jaffe and Marcelo Gomes stand out as more equal among equals. Julie Kent with Angel Corella and Paloma Herrera with Vladimir Malakhov introduce the athletic partnering, and Ms. Jaffe introduces the diamond motif in a lift that will recur. Irina Dvorovenko and Maxim Belotserkovsky stood out in brief, fast solos woven into the choreography's texture, and Sandra Brown and Herman Cornejo darted in and out.</p>
        <p>Oksana Konobeyeva and Gennadi Saveliev as well as Ekaterina Shelkanova with a brilliantly dancing Carlos Molina occupied the middle ground between the ensemble and the principals. But Mr. Corella and Ms. Kent had the stage alone for a playful courtship, full of slides and swoons. Ms. Jaffe and Mr. Gomes, whose duets had a flourish, led the finale, which somehow seemed disconnected from the orchestra.</p>
        <p>Ermanno Florio's conducting nonetheless could not be faulted during the evening. Mr. Corella and Ms. Kent flowed elegantly through part of Act II in ''Swan Lake.'' Mr. Malakhov and Amanda McKerrow seemed to be dancing ''Giselle'' instead of George Balanchine's ''Tchaikovsky Pas de Deux.'' Mr. Corella's bravura rightly wowed all in the ''Corsaire'' pas de deux with Ms. Jaffe, and Jose Manuel Carreno was equally magnificent in ''Diana and Acteon'' with Ms. Herrera.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kent and Julio Boca led the finale of ''Theme and Variations,'' and Mr. Boca and Alessandra Ferri acted their way lustily through the bedroom duet from Kenneth MacMillan's ''Manon.'' Nina Ananiashvili brought down the house with her arm-rippling and idiosyncratic ''Dying Swan.''</p>
