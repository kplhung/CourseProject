        <hl1>Mr. McCain's Medicine</hl1>
      </hedline>
      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial on Sen John McCain's endorsement of Gov George W Bush expresses disappointment that Bush offered no concessions on issues to win needed support; urges Bush to adopt McCain's stand in favor of campaign finance reform</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>For a defeated candidate in the Republican presidential race, Senator John McCain has not suffered from lack of attention. With his high poll numbers, Mr. McCain might have made a credible  third-party candidate in November. Yesterday, however, he took the prudent course and endorsed Gov. George W. Bush, joking that he preferred taking his medicine now rather than later. Clearly he figured that he had a brighter future inside the G.O.P. than as a spoiler outside it. It was disappointing that Mr. Bush offered no concessions on campaign reform or other issues in return for an endorsement he really needed.</p>
        <p>There is a certain G.O.P. ritual for defeated candidates to endorse the nominees of their parties, but it often goes awry. In 1976 Gov. Ronald Reagan of California gave such a tepid endorsement of President Gerald Ford that Mr. Ford never fully recovered. Back in 1960 Richard Nixon, then the vice president, was so eager to win the endorsement of Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York that he agreed to a set of party principles, known as the Fifth Avenue compact, that made him suspect among conservative Republicans.</p>

        <p>For a defeated candidate in the Republican presidential race, Senator John McCain has not suffered from lack of attention.

        <p>There is a certain G.O.P. ritual for defeated candidates to endorse the nominees of their parties, but it often goes awry. In 1976 Gov. Ronald Reagan of California gave such a tepid endorsement of President Gerald Ford that Mr. Ford never fully recovered. Back in 1960 Richard Nixon, then the vice president, was so eager to win the endorsement of Gov. Nelson Rockefeller of New York that he agreed to a set of party principles, known as the Fifth Avenue compact, that made him suspect among conservative Republicans.</p>
        <p>In approaching the meeting with Mr. McCain yesterday, Mr. Bush seemed to have this history in mind. He made it clear that he wanted the senator's endorsement, but did not want to seem to want it too much. In their joint news conference the governor tried to stress how much they had in common. But he did not look especially pleased about Mr. McCain's vow to continue pressing his agenda. He may have been wondering whether the senator would try to do that at the convention in Philadelphia this summer.</p>
        <p>The continuing popularity of Mr. McCain can be seen in many surveys, including a recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll showing that 23 percent of the voters would prefer him over Mr. Bush or Vice President Al Gore. The USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll shows him with higher approval ratings than either man. The Bush campaign has always been quick to assert that Mr. McCain got his biggest victories in states where independents and Democrats could join with Republicans and vote in the primary. But it is these independent-minded voters who will determine the winner in November. It will not be easy for either Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore, both wealthy political heirs, to attract voters who are drawn to Mr. McCain's outsider appeal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, for his part, has been resistant to identifying with two issues that seem intrinsic to Mr. McCain's appeal. One is campaign finance reform, particularly the McCain-Feingold soft-money ban, which Mr. Bush opposes. Another is Mr. McCain's opposition to a gigantic tax cut that would use up the budget surplus. Mr. Bush probably feels locked in on taxes, but he would be smart to adopt Mr. McCain's stand on campaign finance reform. Otherwise he may find that McCain voters are as hard to get as the senator's endorsement was.</p>
