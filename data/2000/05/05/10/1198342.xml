        <p>When Bestfoods rejected a takeover offer from Unilever last week, it seemed emphatic. The price was inadequate, it said, adding, ''It is not opportune to consider a sale of the company.''</p>
        <p>But over the last few days, senior executives at Bestfoods have talked with the company's largest investors, discussing the reasons for turning down the all-cash offer of $66 a share, or $18.4 billion. Rather than casting doubt on the potential cost savings of the merger, as might be expected, they have said that Unilever has underestimated the savings, at $500 million, when they could be as much as $1 billion.</p>
        <p>''We have been saying to shareholders that we believe there would be substantially more synergies than Unilever is describing,'' said a spokeswoman, Gale Griffin, confirming the discussions. ''We are trying to explain to them our rationale.''</p>
        <p>The executives' position hints that Bestfoods would consider a merger  at the right price, stock analysts said yesterday. ''It's an unusual takeover defense, because it highlights the benefits of consolidation,'' said John R. McMillin, a food stocks analyst for Prudential Securities.</p>
        <p>With another $500 million in cost savings at stake, Bestfoods executives could argue that their shareholders deserve a higher price per share than Unilever has offered. ''Let's have some of it go to the shareholders,'' Mr. McMillin said.</p>
        <p>One stock analyst who had doubted that the merger would occur, given Bestfoods' earlier comments, changed his mind yesterday after learning of the company's talks with investors. ''They are playing real hardball in order to get the highest cash price,'' said Daniel Peris, the analyst, who is with Argus Research. ''As a Unilever shareholder, I might be legitimately concerned, because although the prospects of synergies are great, rarely do these megamergers work as well as they are planned, either on the cost side or the growth side.''</p>
        <p>The union of Bestfoods and Unilever would create the largest food and household products company in the world, with brands like Knorr, Skippy and Hellmann's lining up alongside Wish-Bone, Dove and Ragu. Unilever, which is also in the middle of a restructuring intended to shed some of its less-vibrant brands and stimulate better growth, announced plans last month to buy Ben &amp; Jerry's Homemade for $326 million and Slim-Fast for $2.6 billion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Peris said he remained concerned about what a merger with Bestfoods would do for both sides, as well as the global effects. ''Bestfoods and Unilever are similar in their international strength,'' he said, ''and a merger or acquisition would take international distribution out of the system. It is more useful to have a U.S. company plugged into Bestfoods' distribution than to have Unilever take out or duplicate that distribution.''</p>
        <p>Little progress has been reported by either side since the Bestfoods board voted to reject Unilever's bid a week ago. On Monday, Unilever said a conversation had taken place between that company's chairmen, Niall FitzGerald and Antony Burgmans, and Charles R. Shoemate, the chairman and chief executive of Bestfoods. A spokesman called the conversation ''businesslike,'' and said it was intended to open talks between the companies.</p>
        <p>Mr. FitzGerald and Mr. Shoemate are scheduled to speak, about three and a half hours apart, at a conference for investors being sponsored by Goldman, Sachs next week. Goldman is advising Unilever in the deal, while Bestfoods is represented by Merrill Lynch and Salomon Smith Barney.</p>
