        <p>As the leading men flinched under the hovering Heat, Charlie Ward's skin seemed made of steel fibers more than flesh each time he drove fearlessly into the concrete physique of Alonzo Mourning.</p>
        <p>While the marquee Knicks became flustered by the chaos the Heat's defense inflicted, a steady Ward had antifreeze in his blood as he drifted out on the perimeter and calmly made a couple of devastating 3-pointers.</p>
        <p>For three quarters, Ward took advantage of the limping Tim Hardaway and scored when Patrick Ewing, Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell couldn't find the basket. For three quarters, he dived for loose balls like a cat on yarn and then he retreated into anonymity. Once Ward helped hand his team a lead, he went to the bench and watched them frolic on the Heat's free-throw-induced miseries in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>But it was almost too much prosperity for the Knicks to handle. After some bullish baskets by Ewing, some flashy plays by Sprewell and the late arrival of Houston's jumper, the Knicks built an 18-point, fourth-quarter lead only to allow the Heat to close within 7 points before ending the suspense with a 82-76 Game 2 victory tonight at American Airlines Arena.</p>
        <p>The Heat was devastated. The Knicks had done it to them again. They evened the four-of-seven-game, second-round series at one game each and stole the Heat's precious home-court advantage in the process. In four years of having that edge against the Knicks in the playoffs, it was gone once again.</p>
        <p>''It's been four years of wire to wire,'' Coach Pat Riley said. ''I think it's 365 days, 328 games we've stayed ahead of everyone in the Eastern Conference. I think it comes to 14,060 days, 35,000 hours and over 8 million seconds. And we gave it all back in one two-hour span.''</p>
        <p>By grabbing any rebound in his reach, by scrambling on every play, Ward ripped it out of the Heat's grip. Ward ended the game by shooting 5 for 10 with 13 points and 6 rebounds. And that tied him for the team high in scoring. Around him, the Knicks' big names struggled. Sprewell (2 for 13) had 11 points, Houston (3 for 14) had 12 points and Ewing (4 of 12) ended with 13. When the Knicks' big three were 4 for 27 in the first half, Ward kept his team ahead in the game by sticking to an aggressive plan. No passive jumpers, only assertive drives.</p>
        <p>''I knew I had to go in and I had to pick up the tempo,'' said Ward, who established the tone by driving into Mourning on the Knicks' first basket of the game. ''I'm not a superstar. I don't get a lot of press, but I need to be the guy who pulls the team together.''</p>
        <p>Although the Knicks shot just 35 percent for the game, they held the Heat to 34 by double-teaming Mourning (17 points, 17 rebounds) and closing in on Riley's other shooters. Dan Majerle was 1 for 7 from 3-point range. But the most important difference in the game came at the free-throw line. The Heat made just 19 of 33 attempts while the Knicks hit 31 of 42. Mourning was especially dreadful, making just 7 of 13 from the foul line.</p>
        <p>''It was demoralizing for them,'' Ward said. ''They could have had a lead if it wasn't for their free-throw shooting. We were fortunate they missed.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks were happy to have survived a game that was unsightly in its physical style and numbing by the repetition of whistles that added up to 60 personal fouls. The toll of the fray between these two rivals was registered on the body of Marcus Camby. With an effort equal to Ward's, Camby finished with 10 points, 7 rebounds and 3 blocked shots over 21 minutes.</p>
        <p>As he sat in his locker afterward, Camby also registered one swollen elbow, one cut on his right eye and a sore wrist. Unlike Ward, Camby's body is not encased in the same hard shell. But whose is? In Game 1, Ward clanged heads with Mourning. As the Heat center suffered a dizzy spell, Ward felt nothing.</p>
        <p>''He's one of the toughest guys on the team'' Ewing said. ''He dives on the floor, and has no fear of injury. That's the football player in him. That's Charlie.''</p>
        <p>He's the one who ended the second-guessing of Coach Jeff Van Gundy. In the 24 hours after the Knicks' Game 1 loss, Van Gundy found himself surrounded by second opinions. The active Camby has to be on the floor at the end, the gimpy Hardaway has to be preyed upon, a big backcourt is the answer. In fact, Ward was the solution.</p>
        <p>''I know everyone is looking for monumental changes,'' Van Gundy said before the game. ''But we're not going to change monumentally.''</p>
        <p>Instead, the Knicks simply changed their mentality. They became the aggressors from the start, from the moment Ward drove under the strong chin of Mourning. The Knicks also began swarming Mourning, who beat them in Game 1 with 10 fourth-quarter points.</p>
        <p>''You know you're great when you get 17 points and 17 rebounds and 4 blocks and people ask, 'How did we stop him?','' Van Gundy said. ''I thought we did a better job of keeping him out of the paint. He's hard to handle, but we did a better job.''</p>
        <p>The Heat also drove inside, but couldn't make the Knicks pay from the free-throw line. In the first half, the Knicks hit 16 of 22 free throws, while the Heat missed an amazing 13 of 20, including 8 in a row at one point.</p>
        <p>''There's no excuse,'' Mourning said. ''They're free throws. You have to hit them.''</p>
        <p>Although the Knicks shot an abysmal 28 percent, they had a 38-34 halftime lead. This  trend continued in the third quarter. Once again, Ward set the Knicks up by saving rebounds and then popped a 3-pointer with a minute left in the third to put his team up, 57-50.</p>
        <p>''No one could get going,'' Sprewell said. ''Charlie really pulled us up for most of the game.''</p>
        <p>In the fourth, Ward went to the bench, sat at the end and watched Chris Childs take over the fun. In the middle of a 9-0 run by the Knicks to take a 72-54 lead, Childs hit a 3-pointer of his own.</p>
        <p>''We were started to really feel good about things,'' Sprewell said. ''The rest of us were starting to feed off the energy we'd put into our defense. We played really well until the last five minutes.''</p>
        <p>Then, a couple of loose possessions by the Knicks, and three quick turnovers, gave Jamal Mashburn, who scored a game-high 25 points, a chance to hurt them with some jumpers. In an instant, the Heat was within 76-69. Again, Ward came back into the game, helped restore calm after Childs fouled out and finished off what he started.</p>
        <p>''Charlie is without a doubt our best hustle player,'' Van Gundy said. ''I think he showed that again tonight. He does things that don't show up on the stats, but help you win.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>After a nondescript first round against Toronto, KURT THOMAS was nearly invisible with six minutes during Game 1 of the Knicks' second-round series; Tuesday night he had 6 points. Thomas, who will be a free agent at the end of the season, was asked if he thought his recent performance would affect the kind of deal he may get from the Knicks or another team. ''I can't think like that,'' said Thomas, who averaged 8 points, 6.3 rebounds and 24.6 minutes a game this season. ''I think I've showed people during the regular season that I can play at this level. Now, it's just about the opportunity coming my way. And it hasn't happened.'' Against Toronto, Thomas averaged 3.3 points and 1.7 rebounds in 14.3 minutes off the bench.</p>
