        <p>Hillary Rodham Clinton endorsed a series of stringent gun-control measures yesterday, calling for the licensing of all new gun owners and the registration of new guns. Mrs. Clinton, the Democratic candidate for United States Senate, also warmly praised Gov. George E. Pataki, a Republican, for proposing a ''ballistic fingerprint'' database to help police investigators track down guns used in crimes.</p>
        <p>In a speech to the Newspaper Association of America in Manhattan, Mrs. Clinton offered her support for the licensing and registration measure in advance of the Million Mom March in Washington on Sunday, a demonstration that is being staged in favor of what its organizers call ''common-sense gun control.''</p>
        <p>''The moms who are marching in Washington this Sunday have it right: we have to license and register all handguns,'' said Mrs. Clinton, who plans to participate in the march.</p>
        <p>She added: ''Many will argue that we don't need sensible gun control, and that these measures undermine the rights of gun owners. And of course, we all know the slogan that guns don't kill, only people do. We have to do more to stand up to those who refuse to believe the reality that guns do kill, and that common-sense gun measures can make a difference.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton stopped short of saying that all guns should be registered, describing that proposal as unrealistic. The measures have been introduced, in various forms, in Congress, but they have faced strong Republican opposition.</p>
        <p>Gun control is a frequent point of division between Democratic and Republican candidates in Congressional races, and it has proved to be a particularly strong issue in New York races. Charles E. Schumer, a Brooklyn Democrat, repeatedly attacked Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato for opposing gun-control measures when he defeated Mr. D'Amato, the Republican incumbent, in 1998.</p>
        <p>But the contrast is not as sharp in Mrs. Clinton's expected contest with Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. The mayor and the first lady hold almost identical views on gun control, which could complicate any effort by Mrs. Clinton to draw a contrast. Mr. Giuliani's campaign manager, Bruce J. Teitelbaum, said, ''As a senator, New Yorkers will know exactly what Mayor Giuliani will do because he doesn't just talk about gun control,  he actually has a record of taking an historic number of guns off the streets.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton went out of her way to praise a proposal by Mr. Pataki that would require new guns to be fired before they are sold to make a record of their ballistic fingerprint, or the marks left on a bullet that are unique to each weapon. Mrs. Clinton's praise was notable because the governor has been mentioned as a potential candidate for Senate if Mr. Giuliani, who has prostate cancer, decides to skip the race.</p>
        <p>''I applaud Governor Pataki here in this state, who showed real leadership in proposing a state-based ballistics program, and I think it's something that needs to be done on a national level,'' Mrs. Clinton said.</p>
        <p>Under the other proposals supported by Mrs. Clinton, prospective gun buyers would have to obtain a photo license, which would be issued only after they had undergone a criminal record check and passed a gun safety examination. Also, all sales of new guns, or transfers of guns, would be recorded in a national registry.</p>
