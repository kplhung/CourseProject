        <p>Actual vinyl master discs used in recording music of Charlie Parker in late 1940's are being cleaned up at Denon Digital plant in Madison, Ga, where Paul W Reid III and his colleagues are preparing CD package of Parker's early studio years, recorded on Savoy label; photo of Reid at work, and members of Charlie Parker's quintet in 1947 (M)</p>

        <p>The hayloft on the flat, rich Georgia field here was swept away in 1987, transformed like so much of the state into a manufacturing plant with flagpoles, loading docks and endless blank walls.

        <p>The hayloft on the flat, rich Georgia field here was swept away in 1987, transformed like so much of the state into a manufacturing plant with flagpoles, loading docks and endless blank walls. But when Paul W. Reid III takes a fragile acetate disc and puts it on a specially made turntable, a small room in the factory becomes the Harry Smith Studios across from Carnegie Hall on a September day in 1948.</p>
        <p>This was the actual disc that was used to record Charlie Parker that particular day, before the use of magnetic recording tape. Parker, at the height of his abilities, was playing ''Parker's Mood'' with Miles Davis, John Lewis, Curly Russell and Max Roach, and the fidelity of the ancient recording medium is astonishing. The group seems to be in the room, working on one of five takes of the now-classic slow blues they would attempt that day. The struggle to get it just right seems palpable.</p>
        <p>But the evocative powers of the old 16-inch disc are even more remarkable considering the journey that it and almost 3,000 others have taken to reach this small Southern town, where Mr. Reid and his colleagues at what is now the Denon Digital plant are preparing a CD package of Parker's early studio years.</p>
        <p>Savoy, the label that recorded these Parker sessions, was founded in Newark in 1942 by a cranky electronics salesman named Herman Lubinsky, and the company bought other labels or changed hands countless times. Its huge archive of acetates and tapes -- one of the finest documents of the bebop era -- has repeatedly moved to warehouses around the country. In 1991, when Savoy was acquired by the Japanese Denon label, the tapes and acetates were loaded on a 747 and sent to Tokyo.</p>
        <p>But in 1997, after a Japanese release of some of the Savoy material on CD, Denon decided the archive was better off in its home country. The company wanted to release a series of remastered compilations on CD, using American producers and engineers, and it chose its CD pressing plant, built here in Madison in 1987, as the headquarters for the project.</p>
        <p>''It makes sense from a cost standpoint,'' said Dan Marx, Savoy's director of artists and repertory and the project manager for the series. ''They own the plant, so they don't have to rent out extra space. We've got the Rolls-Royce of tape machines and equipment here, and with the Internet and the airport not far away it doesn't really matter where you are.''</p>
        <p>And so the original recordings of seminal figures like Lester Young, Dizzy Gillespie and Erroll Garner were shipped here, 50 miles east of Atlanta, to a town of 3,500 better known for its pristine collection of antebellum homes and the corporate headquarters of the Pennington Seed Company and Applebee's Restaurants.</p>
        <p>Denon has built a climate-controlled room in the back of the plant to house the long ranks of acetate discs in their white cardboard boxes, along with priceless jazz relics like a telegram from Lubinsky to Parker ordering him to show up at a recording session on Nov. 26, 1945.</p>
        <p>Orrin Keepnews, a venerable jazz producer who is supervising the series, said he was accustomed to hitting the clubs and favorite restaurants when he traveled from his home in San Francisco to New York to produce a new recording. Traveling to Madison several times a year, however, has proved a bit different.</p>
        <p>''It's a charming town, but it's not exactly a bustling center of night life,'' he said. ''So my whole work ethic has changed. I work late, work weekends. There's not much else to do. But there is a good pizza restaurant there.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Keepnews and Mr. Marx have kept busy digging through the archives, occasionally turning up unreleased recordings of sessions with Dexter Gordon, John Lee Hooker or the singer Little Jimmy Scott. Mr. Marx discovered in the files that a sterling recording of Marian McPartland live at the Hickory House in 1953 was made by a young Rudy Van Gelder, jazz's most distinguished engineer, at the dawn of his career. The label also released a rarely heard session with John Coltrane and the nearly forgotten trumpeter Wilbur Harden.</p>
        <p>All of the Parker material has been released several times before, but the eight-CD compilation being prepared for reissue this fall will also include his work for the Dial label, bringing together nearly all of his early studio work in one package.</p>
        <p>''It's basically the complete work of Charlie Parker in the studio before Norman Granz got his hands on him,'' said Mr. Keepnews, referring to the impresario of the Verve label, who recorded Parker through 1954. ''No one's ever put it in one place before. And I think the modern technology makes it sound better than previous reissues, although I'm taking my life in my hands saying that.''</p>
        <p>At the risk of annoying a few audiophile purists, the new releases take advantage of several new devices, made by Cedar Audio and Sonic Solutions, intended to remove the pops and clicks and other surface noises on the old acetates and tapes without affecting the music. The earlier Japanese Denon releases, by contrast, were straight from the acetates, with no technological improvements to the sound.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reid, a Madison native who studied for several years with acetate experts learning new techniques for transfer to digital recording, has spent hours with each disc, washing out the decades of grime and mold and studying their grooves to decide which stylus would bring out the best sound.</p>
        <p>''The way I look at it, they didn't record scratches,'' said Mr. Reid, with the only drawl of the reissue team. (Mr. Marx moved to Atlanta from New Jersey.) ''There's a lot you can do nowadays to improve the sound.</p>
        <p>''But we also believe that less is more when it comes to restoration. It's a fine line, and you want to err on the side of keeping the music as close as possible to the original.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reid, a blues guitarist in his spare time, sometimes uses a note from his electric guitar to make sure the discs are spinning at the right speed, since they were not always reliably recorded. If a musician has stepped too far from the microphone on the original recording, he will bring up the volume on the master, and he keeps a hand on the Cedar machine to turn down the noise reduction if it seems to be interfering with the presence of the music. Listeners will have to decide for themselves whether to trust the judgments.</p>
        <p>''There's an aliveness on the old acetates that you just don't get from tape,'' Mr. Keepnews said. ''So you don't want to do a disservice to that by letting the technical advances run away and rule you. That's why I was so surprised to find a local Georgia boy who turned out to be a damn good mastering engineer. We gave the South a shot, and it paid off.''</p>
