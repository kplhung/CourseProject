        <p>DIETZGEN-Carole Mertens of Indian Wells, California. Died April 24, 2000. Wife of Walter who died on August 8, 1999. She is survived by her sons, Henry of Reno, NV, Charles of NYC, and Mark of Phoenix, AZ, and grandchildren, Alexandra, Tasha, Conor and Delaney. Carole was not only a loving wife and mother but a person who always felt the need to help others. She used her nursing talents which she learned during WW II in Belgium to aid and comfort others as a volunteer nurse, especially at St. Francis Hospital in Roslyn, NY. She received the Theodore Roosevelt Award for Volunteers in 1962. She will be remembered for her perceived French (really Belgium) accent, engaging smile and sincere and open attitude toward all she met.</p>
