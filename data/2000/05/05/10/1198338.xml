        <p>Adding a new twist to the already complicated racial discrimination lawsuit brought against Coca-Cola by a group of its black employees, Coke said yesterday that it was becoming a major advertiser on a cable channel owned by a Florida lawyer who last month began representing four of the plaintiffs.</p>

        <p>Adding a new twist to the already complicated racial discrimination lawsuit brought against Coca-Cola by a group of its black employees, Coke said yesterday that it was becoming a major advertiser on a cable channel owned by a Florida lawyer who last month began representing four of the plaintiffs.</p>
        <p>Coke signed a five-year agreement with the Atlanta-based channel, MBC Network, which plans to broadcast children's shows, movies, cartoons and sports programs specifically for black families 24 hours a day, according to a statement from MBC.</p>
        <p>The channel, owned by Willie D. Gary, was formed in 1998. It is backed by Evander Holyfield, the boxer; Marlon D. Jackson, one of the original Jackson Five; Cecil Fielder, formerly of the Detroit Tigers; and Alvin D. James, a longtime broadcaster, as well as Mr. Gary.</p>
        <p>Coke's name will appear on print and electronic announcements connected with the channel, which will advertise all Coke brands, according to the statement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gary represents four of the named plaintiffs in the lawsuit against Coca-Cola, which was filed 13 months ago and contends that the plaintiffs were denied promotions, raises and other advancement at the company because of their race.</p>
        <p>The deal with Coke could raise questions about a conflict of interest between Mr. Gary's role in the lawsuit and Coke's support of his business venture. Mr. Gary could not be reached last night for comment.</p>
        <p>Cyrus Mehri, the lawyer who originally represented the four and continues to represent four other current and former Coke employees in the lawsuit, said the arrangement ''is an issue between Mr. Gary and the four individuals he represents.''</p>
        <p>''My team's focus is on fighting for the best possible resolution for the class,'' Mr. Mehri added.</p>
        <p>A Coke spokesman said the company's discussions and final negotiations occurred before Mr. Gary announced his intention to get involved in the lawsuit, which is seeking class-action status for as many as 2,000 Coke employees,</p>
        <p>''We're making the ad buy because it gives us an opportunity to support what we believe is some very meaningful programming and connect our advertising with African-American consumers on a frequent and consistent basis,'' said the spokesman, Ben Deutsch.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gary, who is best known for obtaining a $500 million award in a 1995 case against the Loewen funeral home company, was introduced to Coke's former chairman, M. Douglas Ivester, by the Rev. Jesse Jackson. Mr. Gary is Mr. Jackson's lawyer. The Loewen award was eventually settled at $175 million.</p>
        <p>Coke and the employees named in the lawsuit began court-ordered mediation last month.</p>
