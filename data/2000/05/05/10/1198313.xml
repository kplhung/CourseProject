        <p>CUNY Security Head Quits</p>
        <p>JOSE A. ELIQUE, who turned security at the City University of New York into a more professional and centralized operation, resigned last week to take a similar post at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>Before his arrival in 1991 as CUNY's director of university security and public safety, most campus security was handled by part-time guards from private contractors like Pinkerton. To the dismay of some who saw the beefed-up security as anathema in an academic setting, Mr. Elique created a cadre of 600 full-time professional ''peace officers'' who dressed like police officers and were trained at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. On one campus,  Lehman College, they even carry guns, although at others the officers do not even carry clubs or pepper spray.</p>

        <p>CUNY Security Head Quits</p>
        <p>JOSE A. ELIQUE, who turned security at the City University of New York into a more professional and centralized operation, resigned last week to take a similar post at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>Before his arrival in 1991 as CUNY's director of university security and public safety, most campus security was handled by part-time guards from private contractors like Pinkerton. To the dismay of some who saw the beefed-up security as anathema in an academic setting, Mr. Elique created a cadre of 600 full-time professional ''peace officers'' who dressed like police officers and were trained at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. On one campus,  Lehman College, they even carry guns, although at others the officers do not even carry clubs or pepper spray.</p>
        <p>Their presence at some tense campus situations, like the protests over the removal of remedial students from CUNY's senior colleges, led critics to assert that the security officers were too militaristic. CUNY is seeking a replacement for Mr. Elique, and officials say the university may return to a less police-oriented security model.</p>
        <p>Suit Testimony Near an End</p>
        <p>JUSTICE LELAND DEGRASSE of State Supreme Court is almost finished hearing testimony in a seven-month-old trial over a lawsuit that poses the most serious challenge yet to New York State's method of financing public schools.</p>
        <p>The lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan by a coalition called the Campaign for Fiscal Equity, argues that the school financing formula shortchanges New York City and deprives students of their right to a ''sound, basic education'' under the State Constitution. The plaintiffs contend that the city's students cannot meet the state's new education standards without a sharp increase in state aid.</p>
        <p>But the state's lawyers have argued that students are required to have only a ''minimally adequate'' education. They have attributed low performance by city students to poverty and wasteful spending by the Board of Education.</p>
        <p>Chess Team Is 2nd in U.S.</p>
        <p>After a heady run during which it captured the New York City and State Chess Championships, the Edward R. Murrow High School Chess Team recently took second place in the National High School Finals in Charlotte, N.C.</p>
        <p>Almost 1,400 players from 344 schools in 32 states took part in the event. Each team member played about 28 hours of chess (seven games at an average of four hours a game). Murrow sent 13 players, including IRINA KRUSH, the top female chess player in the United States.</p>
        <p>The Masterman School of Philadelphia took first place. The teams were separated by half a point, with Masterman at 21 and Murrow at 20 1/2. Murrow's coach, ELIOT WEISS, called it the ''smallest discrepancy you can have.''</p>
        <p>''It was exciting and we're very proud, but the kids were extremely disappointed to finish in second place,'' said Mr. Weiss, whose teams have won six state and three national titles in the last 12 years.</p>
