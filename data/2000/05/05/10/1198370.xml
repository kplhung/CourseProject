        <p>Lacking Jim Florio's name recognition or Jon S. Corzine's buying power, the Republicans from New Jersey running for the United States Senate find themselves desperate to introduce themselves to wide audiences before the June 6 primary. But they have been unable, as yet, to afford commercials on broadcast television.</p>
        <p>Not to worry, they say: there's always cable TV.</p>
        <p>Both James W. Treffinger, the Essex County executive, and Representative Robert Franks, a congressman from Union County, began running commercials this week on cable systems in the state, joining State Senator William L. Gormley, who first ran such ads in Bergen and Morris Counties several weeks ago.</p>
        <p>The fourth candidate, Murray Sabrin, has not released any ads.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Corzine is now running television ads at a rate of about $1.2 million a week, Mr. Treffinger and Mr. Franks each expect to spend only around $100,000 a week, their aides said -- a negligible amount by broadcast standards, but enough to make an impression on cable.</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Treffinger said that an effective cable campaign cost about 10 percent of one on broadcast television. For example, they said, a 30-second ad during the ABC program ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' costs $55,000 at the discounted rate for political campaigns. But an ad shown on CNN to cable subscribers in Paramus would cost only $30. Even multiplied by dozens of municipalities, the difference is huge. What is more, about 82 percent of New Jersey residents have cable service, compared with a national average of 68 percent.</p>
        <p>''Cable's a very efficient buy in New Jersey,'' said Larry Weitzner, Mr. Treffinger's media consultant. ''You get to pick the systems that you want to air on, so in a Republican primary you can target it to systems where there are a lot of Republicans, and go lighter in or eliminate areas where there aren't, like Hudson County.''</p>
        <p>For example, Mr. Treffinger is spending little in his base of Essex County, and focusing on areas where he can sway voters less familiar with him, his aides said.</p>
        <p>Craig Rankin, a media buyer working with the Treffinger campaign, marveled at the extent of Mr. Corzine's television effort, noting that he had even seen a Corzine commercial during Sunday's broadcast of the Knicks-Heat basketball playoff game on WNBC-TV, a New York City station.</p>
        <p>But he questioned the value of such ads in New Jersey, which represents only a fraction of both the New York and Philadelphia markets. ''For every dollar that you spend on New York TV, you're only using 30 cents of it to cover New Jersey,'' he said. ''And when you throw Philadelphia into the mix, you're wasting another 70 percent.''</p>
        <p>In the new ads, Mr. Treffinger tries to portray himself as the most conservative Republican in the race, Mr. Gormley as the most moderate, and Mr. Franks as the most anti-Florio.</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Gormley nor his media advisers could be reached today, so the extent of his cable television campaign is not known. But he is believed to be reserving most of his money -- he had $1.9 million in cash on hand as of March 31 -- for an aggressive broadcast advertising effort in the last few weeks before the primary, particularly on Philadelphia stations.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Gormley's resources pale next to Mr. Corzine's. This week, for example, television viewers are being bombarded with Corzine ads during the morning and evening news and the afternoon talk shows. Although Mr. Corzine has not increased his overall television spending, a spokesman said, he dropped a 60-second biographical ad and replaced it with two 30-second spots. One calls for registration and licensing of all guns. The other is part of a series of attacks on Mr. Florio.</p>
