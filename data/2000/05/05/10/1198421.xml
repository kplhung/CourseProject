        <p>As people move on with their lives, they tend to cling to the musical tastes they had around age 30. Even as aging dogs learn new tricks, they perform them to the same old score.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, VH1 has started a spinoff called VH1 Classic, which features the videos of musical acts that appeal to an (ahem) older audience: acts like the Rolling Stones, Michael Bolton and Bruce Springsteen. The channel, whose debut was on Monday, is currently available in only the one million homes that subscribe to digital cable services.

        <p>As people move on with their lives, they tend to cling to the musical tastes they had around age 30. Even as aging dogs learn new tricks, they perform them to the same old score.</p>
        <p>With that in mind, VH1 has started a spinoff called VH1 Classic, which features the videos of musical acts that appeal to an (ahem) older audience: acts like the Rolling Stones, Michael Bolton and Bruce Springsteen. The channel, whose debut was on Monday, is currently available in only the one million homes that subscribe to digital cable services. That number is expected to grow appreciably in the coming year.</p>
        <p>John Sykes, VH1's president, said that as popular music has progressed, there has been less room for these baby-boomer acts on VH1, which was conceived as a mellower, older sibling to the brasher and louder MTV. But the definition of ''mellow'' has changed considerably over the years.</p>
        <p>Where VH1 used to feature singers like Smokey Robinson and Mr. Bolton, it is now a regular outlet for Metallica, the heavy-metal group, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers, who have been known to perform in the nude, save for strategically placed socks. Meanwhile MTV is now a haven for the so-called boy bands -- teenage idol groups like 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys -- and the harder, new rock acts.</p>
        <p>''If you look at MTV now, they've had to make room for a lot of young bands,'' Mr. Sykes said. ''So a lot have moved on to VH1's audience.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sykes said that VH1 Classic was essentially taking over VH1's original mission and was intended to serve its original audience, which, Mr. Sykes said, has grown underserved as it has grown gray.</p>
        <p>''There is a huge audience out there of Americans raised on rock 'n' roll and R-and-B who we think are ready and waiting,'' he said. But can they still dance?</p>
