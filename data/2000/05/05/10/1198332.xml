        <p>For the symbolic sum of 10 [pounds], BMW of Germany sold its money-losing Rover subsidiary today to a British consortium that wants to maintain the troubled British automaker as a mass producer of cars and guarantor of thousands of British jobs.</p>
        <p>The purchase price, equivalent to little more than $15, was offset by a heftier promise of a $767 million loan from BMW to enable the buyer, the Phoenix Consortium, to take over the company -- currently losing $3 million a day. German newspapers have labeled Rover ''the English Patient'' because of its losses and low productivity.</p>
        <p>The deal, struck with surprising speed after the collapse 11 days ago of negotiations between BMW and a British venture capital firm, Alchemy Partners, seemed at least for now to avert the threatened closing of Rover's Longbridge plant near Birmingham in the British Midlands. The plant employs about 9,000 people, half of Rover's work force, and provides supply jobs for more than 20,000 others. BMW had said it would shut down the plant if no buyer were found by the end of this month.</p>
        <p>The terms of the sale today showed how desperate BMW was to cut its losses. But analysts said the consortium faced an enormous challenge if it is to succeed where BMW failed after a six-year, multibillion-dollar investment.</p>
        <p>The British pound, at $1.5332 in New York today, is at a stubborn high against the euro, at 90.69 cents -- making exported British-made cars more expensive in Continental Europe and imported rivals cheaper.</p>
        <p>And, without mass sales, analysts said, it is difficult to see how Rover can generate income to develop new models to replace its compact 25 and 45 sedans.</p>
        <p>John Towers, a former Rover chief executive and prominent Midlands businessman who leads the Phoenix Consortium, said the company aimed to produce 203,000 cars a year, slightly below its output of 220,000 in 1999, and would be profitable in two years.</p>
        <p>While BMW's previous negotiations with Alchemy Partners had been expected to lead to thousands of job losses, Phoenix said there would be fewer than 1,000 layoffs at Longbridge.</p>
        <p>''We are delighted that, together with BMW, we have secured a brighter future for Rover and its stakeholders,'' Mr. Towers said.</p>
        <p>His consortium is supported by labor unions, Rover dealers and the British government. Apart from BMW's loan, Phoenix's financial backing includes an offer of $315 million in credit from Burdale Financial, a London-based division of First Union of Charlotte, N.C.</p>
        <p>''I'm hoping we can calm the situation down and get on with making cars,'' Mr. Towers said in a television interview.</p>
        <p>Joachim Milberg, the BMW chief executive, said, ''After intense negotiations, we managed to find a buyer who will prevent the loss of thousands of jobs in the Rover plant in Birmingham, in the supplier industry and in the retail business.''</p>
        <p>Phoenix said Longbridge would make Rover's 25, 45 and flagship 75 model sedans, along with the MGF sports car and a version of the Mini that is to be superseded by one produced by BMW. Alchemy Partners, by contrast, had planned to phase out the Rover marque and operate as the MG Car Company, producing niche sports models. BMW, whose British ventures include the rights to manufacture Rolls-Royce luxury cars, will continue to supply engines for Rover.</p>
        <p>In a previously announced $2.9 billion deal, BMW is selling Rover's sport utility Land Rover division to Ford. It plans to retain a separate auto plant at Oxford.</p>
        <p>The Rover investment -- and the difficulties in getting out of it -- posed such a severe problem for BMW that some questioned its own future as an independent producer of luxury cars. After today's announcement, BMW shares rose 3.6 percent in Frankfurt, to 34.45 euros, or $31.24.</p>
        <p>The purchase of Rover by the consortium is the latest chapter in a long-running story of troubles for the British manufacturer under successive owners. It was state-owned in the 1970's and much of the 80's. British Aerospace bought the company in 1988, followed in 1994 by BMW.</p>
        <p>Mr. Towers indicated at a news conference that he was considering an alliance with a major car producer, possibly Honda, a collaborator with Rover before its sale to BMW. At that time, Mr. Towers was Rover's chief executive. He left a year after the BMW takeover.</p>
        <p>Labor unions welcomed the deal exuberantly. ''It's a fabulously good day for my members,'' said Tony Woodley, of the Transport and General Workers Union, which has negotiated packages for laid-off workers valued at $32,000 to $40,000. ''We are absolutely over the moon.''</p>
        <p>Some analysts remained skeptical of Phoenix's prospects, arguing that Rover did not have the scale to compete in a marketplace dominated by giants like Ford, Volkswagen and General Motors. ''I suspect this just prolongs the agony,'' said Graeme Maxton, an auto industry consultant.</p>
