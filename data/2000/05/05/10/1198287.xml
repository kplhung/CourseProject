        <p>Chosen One</p>
        <p>Nicola Barker, a 34-year-old British writer, won the $115,000 Impac Dublin Literary Award yesterday, beating six other finalists, including the Nobel laureate Toni Morrison and her fellow American, Philip Roth. In winning what is described as the richest literary prize for a single work of fiction, Ms. Barker was cited by an international panel of judges for the ''razor-sharp comic sensibility and flawless structure'' of her novel ''Wide Open.'' In it, she tells a tale of a group of misfits coming to terms with life on a remote island. Ms. Morrison's ''Paradise'' and Mr. Roth's ''I Married a Communist'' were among the books on a list of 101 titles nominated by public libraries in more than 100 cities in 34 countries. The award will be presented on June 17 in Dublin.</p>

        <p>Chosen One</p>
        <p>Nicola Barker, a 34-year-old British writer, won the $115,000 Impac Dublin Literary Award yesterday, beating six other finalists, including the Nobel laureate Toni Morrison and her fellow American, Philip Roth. In winning what is described as the richest literary prize for a single work of fiction, Ms. Barker was cited by an international panel of judges for the ''razor-sharp comic sensibility and flawless structure'' of her novel ''Wide Open.''

The award will be presented on June 17 in Dublin.</p>
        <p>Riviera Rivals</p>
        <p>Twenty-three films will be off and running for the Golden Palm today when the 53rd Cannes International Film Festival opens. A 10-member jury headed by the French director Luc Besson and including the English actors Jeremy Irons and Kristin Scott Thomas will choose from a lineup that is notable for the presence of six Asian films, including the first from Korea, and the absence of Italian productions. Among the competitors are Ken Loach's ''Bread and Roses,'' Joel and Ethan Coen's ''O Brother, Where Art Thou?,'' James Ivory's ''Golden Bowl'' and Liv Ullmann's ''Trolosa.'' Roland Joffe's ''Vatel,'' starring Gerard Depardieu as a 17th-century organizer of royal banquets and co-starring Uma Thurman and Tim Roth, will be the festival's opening attraction.</p>
        <p>Music of Time</p>
        <p>With photographs, large cutouts, record albums, sheet music, maps and installations where spirituals, Pentecostal shout singing, brass band worship services and gospel music can be seen and heard, a new exhibition examines the impact of the musical legacy of slavery and the worship practices of black churches on the African-American heritage and worldwide culture. Developed by the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Service with the National Museum of American History, ''Wade in the Water: African-American Sacred Music Traditions'' runs from tomorrow through June 24 at the Gallery at the American Bible Society, Broadway at 61st Street.</p>
        <p>Large Art</p>
        <p>Lemons, flowers, dominos. All are featured in an exhibition of 20 large-scale paintings by the contemporary artist Donald Sultan that begins today at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington. Instead of canvas, Mr. Sultan, who says ''anything can be used for making art,'' works with such unlikely materials as linoleum, tar, vinyl, spackle and Masonite in creating his still lifes. Focusing on the artist's innovative approach to an established theme, ''Donald Sultan: In the Still-Life Tradition'' continues through July 7.</p>
