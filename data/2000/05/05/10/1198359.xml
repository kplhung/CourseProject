        <p>But a spokesman for the speaker, Assemblyman Jack Collins, said cost estimates were already so high that that Mr. Collins was considering a spending cap for the bill.

        <p>A coalition of community, education and business groups urged the State Assembly speaker today to amend his school construction bill to pay all of the building costs in poor urban districts and allow those projects to be linked to community development plans.</p>
        <p>But a spokesman for the speaker, Assemblyman Jack Collins, said cost estimates were already so high that that Mr. Collins was considering a spending cap for the bill. ''If we want this program to move forward, we have to draw a line in the sand somewhere,'' said the spokesman, Chuck Leitgeb.</p>
        <p>The changes requested by the Coalition for Our Children's Schools are already part of a school construction bill proposed by the State Senate president, Donald T. DiFrancesco, who like Mr. Collins is seeking the Republican nomination for governor.</p>
        <p>Legislators are already running late in addressing overcrowding, health and safety problems and other building needs in New Jersey's 28 poor urban school districts, known as  Abbott districts after a May 1998 ruling in Abbott v. Burke. That ruling imposed a deadline of this spring for the state to address those building needs.</p>
        <p>The cost estimate for the Abbott districts exceeds $7 billion. Adding the estimated costs of building needs in non-Abbott districts, which would be eligible for low-cost loans under the Assembly and Senate bills, would bring the price tag to $14 billion.</p>
        <p>The coalition asked Speaker Collins today to amend his bill before an Assembly vote tentatively set for May 25. The bill includes a formula that could require Abbott districts to contribute to construction costs.</p>
        <p>The Senate is to vote May 18 on Mr. DiFrancesco's bill, which would fully finance the Abbott districts. It would also start a trial program allowing local groups to run school construction projects and include elements to benefit the community, like public libraries and recreation areas.</p>
