        <p>THE COLLABORATOR  The Trial and Execution of Robert Brasillach  By Alice Kaplan  308 pages. University of Chicago Press. $25.</p>
        <p>As the recent case of Augusto Pinochet demonstrates, the question of retribution and reparation for past political wrongs continues to bedevil the collective conscience, which is one reason why Alice Kaplan's clear-headed study of the case of Robert Brasillach in France has a good deal of current-day relevance. Brasillach was a famous novelist, poet and polemicist of the 1930's who turned into a literary collaborator of the Nazis during their occupation of France. Within weeks of the Allied liberation of Paris in 1944 and the installation of a provisional French government under Charles de Gaulle, Brasillach was tried, convicted of treason and executed.</p>
        <p>Many questions emerge from the case, not least of them: Was his conviction justified? Since his only activity during the Occupation was to set words to paper, the question automatically arises: was he executed for his objectionable opinions?</p>
        <p>Complicating the matter, those who prosecuted and judged him had served in the Justice Ministry during the German occupation, when the entire French administration was run by the collaborationist Vichy government of Marshal Philippe Petain. That raises the question of the moral qualifications of the court that decided his fate. Finally, there are the long-term consequences of the prosecution. Did it do harm or good for the French collective conscience?</p>
        <p>Ms. Kaplan, a professor of romance studies and literature at Duke University, confronts all of these interesting questions in ''The Collaborator,'' her reconstruction of Brasillach's career and prosecution. On the first question, the verdict against him, she provides a nuanced but unambiguous judgment: the French jury was correct in finding Brasillach's behavior during the war to have been treasonous. But Ms. Kaplan illuminates the moral ambiguity that stained the Brasillach proceedings and that makes his execution, though not his conviction, retroactively troubling.</p>
        <p>Brasillach, born in 1909, was a brilliant product of the same elite French education that produced near contemporaries like Simone de Beauvoir and Jean Paul Sartre. But unlike the celebrated prodigies who went to school with him in the late 1920's, Brasillach was drawn into the right-wing French tradition of racism and royalism.</p>
        <p>Brasillach, who was believed by his contemporaries to be homosexual, became a novelist of some success, a critic and an editor of fascist magazines, especially the anti-Semitic, anti-Republican Je Suis Partout. He was certainly brilliant, but he was cruelly, smugly, viciously so, the kind of man who could write gleefully of his wish that French-Jewish prisoners of war held in German camps could be excluded from the company of their fellow prisoners, driven away.</p>
        <p>During the occupation his weekly newspaper published a column called ''Everywhere and Elsewhere'' that identified by name Jews who were violating Vichy's strict race laws, when France was infested with the Gestapo agents trying to root out Jews and collaborators. ''Denunciation, in these circumstances, is not opinion,'' Ms. Kaplan writes. ''It is language that goes beyond opinion and ideology, to action.''</p>
        <p>Her depictions of others involved in the drama create a fascinating group portrait of the archetypes of post-liberation France. Brasillach's chief accuser was a former Vichy-era magistrate named Marcel Reboul whose brilliant prosecutorial summation seems to have been the critical ingredient in the conviction. Reboul's service under Vichy, eagerly highlighted for the jury by Brasillach's defense lawyer, Jacques Isorni (who later defended Petain), is examined by Ms. Kaplan who finds some evidence that he used his position to protect would-be victims of Vichy ''justice.''</p>
        <p>In any case, as Ms. Kaplan explains, the newly installed provisional government conducted a purge of judges who had collaborated too enthusiastically with the Vichy regime, for example, by prosecuting members of the Resistance. Despite this she concludes: ''Even with all the measures taken to cleanse the magistrature, the Liberation courts were essentially Vichy courts.'' The presiding judge at the Brasillach trial, Maurice Vidal, served under Vichy and illustrated this continuity.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kaplan's account of the trial, during which Brasillach, cool and composed and brazen in defense of his collaboration, is high drama. Reboul, taking over after a desultory questioning of the defendant by Vidal, called Brasillach ''an almost official denouncer'' who worked in the service of the Gestapo. But while Ms. Kaplan agrees with that sentiment, she also shows that Reboul used a kind of sexually coded language to call attention to Brasillach's presumed homosexuality and to imply that that is what had led him to prostitute himself, and his country, before the German invader. ''His rhetoric,'' Ms. Kaplan writes of Reboul, ''played on the real fear and hatred of homosexuality that was alive in the culture.''</p>
        <p>One of the services of Ms. Kaplan's book is her establishment of the full record of Brasillach's ugly statements during the war, some of which have been conveniently left out of later editions of his work. But she concludes that his execution gave credibility to the image, actively fostered by today's far right in France, of a patriotic innocent done in by the forces of hypocrisy. That is one reason, she argues, that it was wrong to have executed him.</p>
        <p>As she makes that argument, Ms. Kaplan also recalls the inconsistency of the French treatment of its collaborationist past. Why, she asks, was a writer like Brasillach condemned to die, while other figures who behaveds worse received lenient sentences? Rene Bousquet, for example, Paris police commander, delivered Jews to the Gestapo, but he was sentenced only to two years, and even that light penalty was suspended on the grounds that he had helped the Resistance.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kaplan gives a brief answer, namely that crimes against humanity and complicity in deportations to the death camps ''did not yet have a name or a place in the French legal code.'' But she does not delve into why that was so. What her own arguments suggest, though she does not make this point explicit, is that France in 1944 was readier to punish imputed homosexuality than the murder of Jews.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kaplan's fine book in this sense shows that the passage of time illuminates different understandings, and she leaves it to us to reflect on which understanding is better.</p>
