      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The popular soprano Renee Fleming could fill virtually any concert hall these days, even by singing the most traditional repertory. But this season at Alice Tully Hall she has presented two programs of new and recent American songs. The second, on Sunday afternoon, offered new works by four composers written expressly for her. And not only was the hall full, two sections of stage seats were needed.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fleming champions living American composers not from some sense of obligation but because their music excites her. This program began with ''Night Flight to San Francisco,'' the composer Ricky Ian Gordon's setting of a monologue from Part II of Tony Kushner's play ''Angels in America.'' That so many female singers love Mr. Gordon's songs is inexplicable to critics who find his warmed-over pop style terribly cloying. This 12-minute work has some musical substance, however. Mr. Gordon mostly stays out of the way of the text, a pensive speech by the frail character Harper, who fears open spaces. He frames her words with atmospheric harmony and coloristic piano effects, played beautifully by Richard Bado. That said, though all the composers Ms. Fleming performed make the most of her ability to sing sustained, high, soft vocal lines, Mr. Gordon overdid it in his work.</p>

        <p>The popular soprano Renee Fleming could fill virtually any concert hall these days, even by singing the most traditional repertory. But this season at Alice Tully Hall she has presented two programs of new and recent American songs. The second, on Sunday afternoon, offered new works by four composers written expressly for her. And not only was the hall full, two sections of stage seats were needed.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fleming champions living American composers not from some sense of obligation but because their music excites her. This program began with ''Night Flight to San Francisco,'' the composer Ricky Ian Gordon's setting of a monologue from Part II of Tony Kushner's play ''Angels in America.'' That so many female singers love Mr. Gordon's songs is inexplicable to critics who find his warmed-over pop style terribly cloying. This 12-minute work has some musical substance, however. Mr. Gordon mostly stays out of the way of the text, a pensive speech by the frail character Harper, who fears open spaces. He frames her words with atmospheric harmony and coloristic piano effects, played beautifully by Richard Bado. That said, though all the composers Ms. Fleming performed make the most of her ability to sing sustained, high, soft vocal lines, Mr. Gordon overdid it in his work.</p>
        <p>The composer Aaron Jay Kernis played the piano for Ms. Fleming in his new song cycle, ''Valentines,'' based on four sardonic and bracingly feminist poems by Carol Ann Duffy. Mr. Kernis's music here is like some spiky American version of Alban Berg expressionism. At times it has a ferocious intensity, and the harmonic language is thickly chromatic and wildly wayward. So when the music turns reflective -- clearer, simpler, more diatonic -- the effect is doubly powerful. The highly charged vocal writing is nevertheless lyrical, at least as sung by Ms. Fleming, radiantly.</p>
        <p>''The Hill Has Something To Say,'' the composer Craig Harris's setting of a poem by Rita Dove, is scored for soprano, piano and ''amphora'' (the composer's term for the electronic element in the piece, which utilizes the recorded sounds of Mr. Harris blowing through bottles). Ms. Fleming had to activate the electronic keyboard while singing. Though there is a soft-focus New Age quality to the work, Mr. Harris's music is engagingly delicate and precise. And the way the electronic sounds hauntingly prolong piano chords mirrored Ms. Fleming's way with sustained vocal lines.</p>
        <p>Andre Previn was the pianist in three works of his own, including two familiar arias from his 1998 opera ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' in which Ms. Fleming created the role of Blanche Dubois. The more interesting work, which received its premiere, was ''The Giraffes Go to Hamburg,'' Mr. Previn's setting of a mournful excerpt from Isak Dinesen's memoir about two captured giraffes on a cargo steamer bound for a zoo in Germany. Here, adding a solo flute (Renee Siebert) to the mix of voice and piano, Mr. Previn treats the text like a gripping musical monologue, and the music is pungent and dramatically understated.</p>
        <p>Shifting to his jazz mode, Mr. Previn was the stylish accompanist for three encores, songs by Arlen, Ellington and Van Heusen. Ms. Fleming, who sang with jazz groups in college, sounded utterly at home, scat-singing and shaping soft, improvised vocal lines with the breathy beauty of Betty Carter.</p>
