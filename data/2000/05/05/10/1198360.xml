        <p>When Police Commissioner Howard Safir announced yesterday that his doctors had diagnosed prostate cancer, he alluded to the possibility that he might need time off for surgery or recuperation, saying he had ''a great backup staff.''</p>
        <p>As he spoke, he gestured to an intense, straight-backed man who stood between Chief of Department Joseph P. Dunne and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani: Patrick E. Kelleher, the commissioner's second in command.</p>
        <p>''Pat Kelleher can run this department as well as anybody,'' Mr. Safir said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelleher, the first deputy commissioner, hardly flinched. In the event that Mr. Safir must temporarily leave his post, the leadership of the 41,000-member department would fall to Mr. Kelleher, a career officer who rose from patrolling Brooklyn to the highest ranks of the police brass. Laconic and wiry, Mr. Kelleher, 53, is the son of Irish immigrants and a native of Sunset Park, Brooklyn. He joined the department in 1969, after serving two years in the Army. He has made the Police Department his life.</p>
        <p>Now nearing the end of his career, he is regarded as a driven manager, a supervisor who arrives at work each day between 5 and 6 a.m. and stays late into the evenings. As a former commander of the Manhattan South Narcotics Bureau who also was chief of the Internal Affairs Bureau and chief of detectives, he is seen as someone who is comfortable with the tricky levers of power at 1 Police Plaza.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelleher, who is married and has three adult children, was selected for the No. 2 post in April 1997. He has been a quiet, loyal presence during Mr. Safir's tenure as commissioner, responsible for the department's personnel management, discipline and budget.</p>
        <p>In recent months, Mr. Kelleher was reported to have been considering an offer to become chief of security for Merrill Lynch. A senior law enforcement official said yesterday that whatever Mr. Kelleher's plans might be, they were postponed.</p>
        <p>''Pat Kelleher is going to be here for the police commissioner,'' the official said. Characteristically, Mr. Kelleher declined to comment yesterday on Mr. Safir's illness. A department spokesman said he thought it would be unseemly to make any remark.</p>
