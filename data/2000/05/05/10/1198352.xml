        <p>HE'S the resident intellectual for New York City's public school system, an arts dabbler who plays a mean violin, writes a lean libretto and stuffs notes for his next novel in the pocket where his handkerchief should be.</p>
        <p>In his teens, he and his violin sneaked into jam sessions with Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee at Upper West Side coffeehouses, and he moonlighted as a jazz fusion violinist while attending Yale and later Cambridge on a Mellon Fellowship. These days the only music in Jonathan Levi's drab office at the Board of Education's Brooklyn headquarters is the sound of sirens and horn honks leaking in through his closed window. Doesn't matter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levi, 44, is way too busy putting the finishing touches on his next, some would say eccentric, official enlightenment project -- an unusual adult play date that requests the presence of the city's 43 school  superintendents at Carnegie Hall today for a violin lesson with Isaac Stern -- to notice the cacophony outside. Or maybe it's all music to him.</p>
        <p>''I'll bring my fiddle and Isaac Stern's bringing his,'' says Mr. Levi, a pale, preoccupied man with thinning hair gone askew and, this day, an owl-patterned tie (he still can't believe he's taken a job that requires tie wearing). ''My kids are horrified,'' says this stay-at-home writer,  whose most normal work project to date was directing the poet Robert Pinsky's adaption of Dante's ''Inferno'' for the 92nd Street Y.</p>
        <p>Not that he directed in a normal way. When Mr. Levi, who revels in imaginative flights (let the rest of the world fly commercial) decided the ''Inferno'' could be viewed through the prism of the civil rights movement, he took the production to Montgomery, Ala., and staged it from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s former pulpit.</p>
        <p>Now he's entered an inferno of a different kind. ''I used to think there was nothing worse than theatrical politics unless it was academic politics, but the thing I learned very quickly here is that there's nothing worse than political politics,'' he divulges with a wan smile.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levi charts his career path as headed nowhere in particular but everywhere in general, a sampler whose projects may be serendipitous but never half-baked (he and two fellow Cambridge students transformed Granta from a 16-page mimeographed handout to a 356-page heavyweight with bylines like Sontag, Updike, and Rushdie). So he didn't dream of saying no when his Upper West Side soulmate of sorts, Harold O. Levy, a Citigroup executive-turned-interim schools chancellor, asked him to put on a suit and tweak the collective intellect of the seven-member school board.</p>
        <p>Making the arts essential to every child's education is his at times unpopular mandate.</p>
        <p>MR. LEVI admits surprise that Mr. Levy had the chutzpah to stake a claim to the chancellorship under hostile conditions. ''It showed me another side to Harold, that he could put up with whatever scorn was heaped upon him.'' Occasionally on them both.</p>
        <p>''But one of the wonderful things about working with Harold,'' he says, ''is that we always remember this is not the job we have seen our lives directed toward, not the pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. This is the pot of gold in the middle of the rainbow.'' As for politics, Mr. Levi is mum, except for his tongue-in-cheek support of secession for ''The People's Republic of the Upper West Side.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Levi and Mr. Levy met nine years ago at a parental caucus at the private prenursery school attended by their daughters ( Mr. Levi's three children go to private school). At the time, Mr. Levi was scribbling away on his first novel, ''A Guide for the Perplexed'' (Random House, 1992), and Mr. Levy worked for Salomon Brothers, but it turned out they spoke the same language: ''Poetry, philosophy, science,'' recounts Mr. Levi, who experienced further evidence of Mr. Levy's alter ego the evening he brought him to a Wallace Stevens tribute at the 92nd Street Y.</p>
        <p>At the end of the night, when an old tape of Stevens reciting his own work was played, ''I looked over at Harold and he was just melting! This was the greatest thing that had happened to him in weeks, in months!''</p>
        <p>No wonder school board members recently found three Stevens poems in their mailboxes, courtesy of their new boss and his highbrow helper, Mr. Levi. Next came a cosmology lecture attended by three of the seven board members. Today, free lunch and a violin lesson.</p>
        <p>To those school superintendents who refuse to take kindly to ''the opportunity'' of being taught to cradle a violin under their chins, a place usually reserved for their cellular phones, Mr. Levy's executive assistant has a word of warning: ''Remember, the invitation is coming from the boss, so if you're an employee and you don't take advantage of this offer, fine, but I don't think it looks terribly good.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Levi, music lessons were de rigueur, culture a homegrown phenomenon (his father is a philosophy professor at Columbia, his mother, a social worker). Ideas flew in  their apartment like verbal fastballs.</p>
        <p>''The dinner table conversation was always about ideas and there was never much of an opportunity to get away with a sloppy idea,'' recalls Mr. Levi, whose father worries, now that he's got this serious day job, when he's going to finish his second novel. And if Mr. Levy's tenure (and his own) expires in July? It's all grist for the third novel.</p>
