        <p>The following are three 30-second commercials for the campaigns of Representative Robert D. Franks, State Senator William L. Gormley and James W. Treffinger, the Essex County executive, who are competing for the Republican nomination for United States Senate from New Jersey. The ads are running on cable television stations throughout the state. A fourth candidate, Murray Sabrin, has not yet run any television ads.</p>
        <p>James W. Treffinger</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Jamestown Associates  TITLE -- ''Conservative Principles''  ON THE SCREEN -- Mr. Treffinger addresses the camera, then is shown talking to children, working in his county office and talking to an office worker. A shot of a billowing United States flag gives way to Mr. Treffinger, hand over his heart, saluting as Cub Scouts raise the flag. The ad closes with Mr. Treffinger appealing directly to the camera.  SCRIPT -- Mr. Treffinger: ''Essex County used to be called ungovernable, but like Rudy Giuliani in New York, we've proved conservative principles work. We said no to every tax increase and cut spending by $90 million. We cut welfare rolls in half and put welfare recipients to work. Crime is down, and we've restored honesty and integrity to government. We can make these same conservative ideas work in Washington. I'm Jim Treffinger, and I'd like to be your senator.''  SCORECARD -- Mr. Treffinger, a former Democrat, is campaigning as a fiscal conservative. The comparison to Mr. Giuliani underscores that the New York mayor is better known in North Jersey than any of the four Republicans running in the New Jersey Senate primary.</p>

        <p>PRODUCER -- Jamestown Associates  TITLE -- ''Conservative Principles''  ON THE SCREEN -- Mr. Treffinger addresses the camera, then is shown talking to children, working in his county office and talking to an office worker.

        <p>DAVID M. HALBFINGER</p>
        <p>William L. Gormley</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Stevens Reed Curcio &amp; Company  TITLE -- ''Strongest Candidate''  ON THE SCREEN -- Videotape of Mr. Gormley meeting with construction workers, still photos of the golden dome at the University of Notre Dame and of a young Mr. Gormley in a Marine Corps uniform. Then videotape of Mr. Gormley talking with citizens, and again with men in hard hats, then appearing with Gov. Christine Todd Whitman at the dedication of the Atlantic City Convention Center.  SCRIPT -- ''Republicans, take a look at why Bill Gormley is our strongest candidate for U.S. Senate: Notre Dame graduate, Marine Corps captain and a leader in our State Senate whom Tom Kean calls a man of unquestioned integrity. Gormley voted against Florio's tax hike and voted 37 times to cut taxes and provide property tax relief for working families. In fact, Governor Whitman praised Gormley as a nonstop advocate for tax cuts. Bill Gormley. Honest. Tax cutter. The Republican who can win in November.''  SCORECARD -- Mr. Gormley, who boasts that he defied the National Rifle Association by voting to ban assault weapons, is trying to claim the moderate wing of the state Republican Party for himself. Here he does so by associating himself with former Governor Kean and Governor Whitman -- neither of whom has yet endorsed a candidate in the primary.</p>
        <p>Robert D. Franks</p>
        <p>PRODUCER -- Smith &amp; Harroff Inc., with Republican Advertising Inc.  TITLE -- ''Remember Him?''  ON THE SCREEN -- Mr. Franks holds up a framed, black-and-white, unflattering photo of former Gov. Jim Florio, then addresses the camera close-up, then shows the Florio photo again.  SCRIPT -- Mr. Franks: ''Remember him? He's back. Now he wants to be your senator. Who can afford that? I know Jim Florio, because as a state legislator, I led the revolt against his taxes. I'm Bob Franks. As a congressman, I helped write the first balanced budget in a generation, at the same time we were protecting Social Security. I'm the Republican with the record to be our next senator. Florio? Believe me, once is enough.''  Announcer: ''Congressman Bob Franks. Ready right now to be our senator.''  SCORECARD -- Mr. Franks, who accuses Mr. Gormley of having been too cozy with Governor Florio, is positioning himself as the most anti-Florio candidate. This ad also reminds voters that Mr. Franks is the only Republican candidate with experience in Congress.</p>
