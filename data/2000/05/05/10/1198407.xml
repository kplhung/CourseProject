        <p>Despite the swiftly climbing starting salaries that big law firms are paying newly minted lawyers, an abundance of talented law students still seek to start their careers in the New York area in far less lucrative public service jobs like prosecutor and public defender, law school officials and other experts say.</p>
        <p>But some school officials also say that the lure of ever fatter pay at the big firms is lessening student interest in going from graduation to work as judges' law clerks, often prestigious but similarly lower-paying posts. And they say it is harder to recruit good law students for summer jobs like research assistants to professors because many such students can find positions as summer associates at the big firms for $2,000 or more a week, in contrast to the $7.50 to $10 an hour usually paid for  assisting the faculty members.</p>
        <p>As law schools in and around New York City prepare to graduate about 4,000 new bar candidates over the next few weeks, starting pay at the area's large and prestigious firms, and its impact, are frequent topics in the local legal world and its boot camps for budding lawyers. The discussions were sparked by those firms' recent salary increases for first-year associates.</p>
        <p>In January, the firms raised basic pay for such associates to as much as $125,000, with year-end bonuses making possible total pay of up to $160,000. The previous base was up to $105,000, with the possibility of up to $120,000 with bonuses. The sharp increases reflect a national trend in which big firms are paying associates at all levels more to stem defections to dot-com companies.</p>
        <p>By contrast, salaries for new law graduates in the district attorneys' offices in New York City largely range from $35,000 to $42,000. At the Legal Aid Society, which represents poor people in criminal and civil cases, those salaries are $35,000, and they are $44,000 for new graduates who become law clerks to federal judges in the New York area.</p>
        <p>But sharp pay discrepancies between public service law and big-firm practice are nothing new, with the firms' latest increases having merely widened the gap.</p>
        <p>Career services experts at law schools and bar associations, as well as officials in local prosecution and public defense offices, said in interviews that they continued to see a  plentiful pool of strong applicants for those offices, even though their salaries made it hard to pay off student loan debts that could be $100,000 or more.</p>
        <p>''A student committed to going into public interest law when there was a $110,000 salary'' in the big private firms ''will not be swayed when salaries there are $125,000 and even more,'' said Cynthia Wyatt, director of career services at New York Law School and head of the City Bar Association's committee on lawyers in transition.</p>
        <p>About 20 percent of her school's graduates take their first jobs with prosecution and other government offices or with groups like the Legal Aid Society, somewhat higher than the national average of about 15 percent reported by the National Association for Law Placement.</p>
        <p>Jennifer Mone, a lawyer with the firm of Farrell Fritz and head of the bar association's committee on law student perspectives, said that while dot-coms attracted associates, they were not usually a job market for someone fresh out of law school ''because they need more experienced people.''</p>
        <p>Daniel Greenberg, president of the Legal Aid Society, said, ''For every space, we have dozens of applications and that hasn't changed in recent years.''</p>
        <p>He said the applicants were from schools like Harvard and Yale as well as from local law schools.</p>
        <p>Officials of the district attorneys'  offices in Queens, Manhattan and Brooklyn reported declines in total job applications from graduating law students -- to about 900 from 1,100 in Queens since 1992, to 1,300 from 1,500 in Manhattan over the last year and to 1,850 this year from an average of 2,000 in recent years in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>But all said they were still getting many strong candidates for the relatively few openings -- only 30 this year in Queens, 60 in Manhattan and 50 in Brooklyn. The real problem, they said, is retaining seasoned prosecutors.</p>
        <p>Stephen Gillers, vice dean of New York University Law School, and James Castro-Blanco, associate dean of career services at St. John's University School of Law, have already seen a decline in student interest in going from graduation to law clerkships for a year or two with federal judges, long a route for good students seeking valuable experience and mentoring as well as increased marketability later.</p>
        <p>But Edward R. Korman, chief judge of the Federal Court for the Eastern District of New York, said such winds of change on campus were not being felt in his chambers, which were still ''deluged'' with hundreds of applications for his three clerkships.</p>
        <p>In telling of professors finding it harder to recruit students for summer research because of the lucrative summer associate posts at big firms, James Cohen, an associate professor at Fordham University Law School and head of the City Bar Association's legal education committee, said, ''The lure of the marketplace has put pressure on the time students are prepared to spend on law school activities, and I certainly view that as a negative.''</p>
