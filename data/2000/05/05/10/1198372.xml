        <p>This was not the way it was supposed to unfold.</p>
        <p>As New York's archbishop, Cardinal John O'Connor, was being buried in the crypt of St. Patrick's Cathedral on Monday, there was little question of the usual month of respect and reflection before his successor would be announced.</p>
        <p>A priest attending the funeral asked Bishop Edward M. Egan of Bridgeport for confirmation he was indeed the Vatican's choice, as everybody, including the bishop's brother-in-law from Maryland, had been saying. ''I'll let you know after Wednesday,'' the bishop was overheard answering.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the bishop will be installed in a ceremony not long after that, according to his brother-in-law, Raymond Egan, who said he planned to visit New York for the occasion.</p>
        <p>Whatever happened to papal secrecy? What of the half-dozen other candidates whose names had surfaced since last summer? And why did Bishop Egan not initially figure among them?</p>
        <p>The selection of archbishops is normally played close to the vest, with those who participate sworn never to reveal its details. The choice becomes official only when  Rome speaks, either directly or through its delegate in the United States, and in recent memory, there have been no real cracks in the wall of confidentiality protecting Vatican appointments.</p>
        <p>''I've never seen anything this close to the fact covered this way,'' said Msgr. John Doherty, a retired priest who was vicar of the Bronx when Bishop Egan worked in New York as auxiliary bishop for education.</p>
        <p>As Cardinal O'Connor's health failed last autumn and winter, a committee of American bishops began the search for his successor. They canvassed leading clergymen and lay Catholics about the problems facing the archdiocese now and in the coming years, gathering opinions about who might best fill the job.</p>
        <p>A number of names surfaced as possibilities. These included that of  Bishops Henry Mansell of Buffalo  and Sean O'Malley of Fall River, Mass., and Archbishops Justin F. Rigali of St. Louis, Theodore E. McCarrick of Newark and Edwin F. O'Brien, who oversees military chaplains.</p>
        <p>One church official who was briefed by the cardinal said that the final list of names handed to Pope John Paul II came down to three: Archbishops Rigali and O'Brien, and Bishop Mansell, who Cardinal O'Connor said he favored for the job.</p>
        <p>Another clergyman, who was consulted by the Vatican and who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he had suggested Bishop Egan, along with two other candidates, as his choices. Weighing heavily in this clergyman's mind was the need to close and consolidate schools and parishes in the New York archdiocese, whose population had changed substantially during Cardinal O'Connor's 16-year tenure.</p>
        <p>Bishop Egan, he noted, had been able to close and merge parishes and schools in the Bridgeport diocese, where he has served as bishop since 1988. And at 68, this clergyman said, Bishop Egan would be an interim archbishop, making the necessary changes before submitting his letter of resignation upon turning 75, as Vatican tradition demands.</p>
        <p>''I felt that he would be very good for the interim position, in which he'd take some difficult actions that would result in a measure of unpopularity, and that was what was needed,'' the clergyman said. But animosity, he added, was not inevitable: an astute archbishop could win people over by revitalizing the merged or streamlined parishes and redefining their missions.</p>
        <p>Bishop Egan's name was not on  the list of three names, the terna,  submitted to the pope for final consideration, said the church official in whom the cardinal confided. The Vatican had assigned Bishop Egan to New York in 1985 shortly after John O'Connor arrived here, and the two men had had a rocky start. The clergyman who suggested Bishop Egan's name to the Vatican said he suspected that it did not make the terna  because the cardinal and the bishop ''were just on different wavelengths.''</p>
        <p>In the deliberations to narrow the choices, Archbishop O'Brien's name fell first, the official who was briefed by the cardinal said. One faction involved in the selection supported Archbishop Rigali, while another faction, to which Cardinal O'Connor belonged, supported Bishop Mansell.</p>
        <p>In the end, the pope agreed with neither group, and selected a name of his own, the archdiocesan official said, much as he had done in appointing John O'Connor archbishop of New York. He had come to know Bishop Egan, an expert in canon law who spent 18 years in the Vatican, when he was briefed by the bishop on canon law, said the cleric who had submitted Bishop Egan's name. .</p>
        <p>In February, Cardinal O'Connor visited the Vatican -- a trip that doubled as a farewell visit and lobbying effort on behalf of Bishop Mansell, said the official in whom the cardinal confided. Not long after that, Cardinal O'Connor, in a letter of farewell to the 870 priests who worked under him, said he expected to see his replacement named sometime in March.</p>
        <p>But March passed quietly, as did April, with church officials whispering that the Vatican seemed inclined to allow Cardinal O'Connor to die in office, as had all previous archbishops of New York.</p>
        <p>Then, as Cardinal O'Connor's illness lingered, the Vatican appeared to have decided it could not leave New York leaderless indefinitely.  Early last week, several church officials said, preparations began to make public Bishop Egan's appointment to the Roman Catholic Church's most visible pulpit in the country. Word of the impending announcement went out to a limited circle of bishops and their auxiliaries in New York and archbishops throughout the region.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, Cardinal O'Connor's condition deteriorated, and it became clear that his death was imminent. Out of respect for the cardinal, the preparations screeched to a halt. But the word, once out, could not be locked back up.</p>
