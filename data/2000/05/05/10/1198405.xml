        <p>A 20-inch water main burst early yesterday beneath a street in the Spuyten Duyvil section of the Bronx, sending hundreds of thousands of gallons of muddy water coursing down one of the biggest hills in the borough.</p>
        <p>The break in the 33-year-old main beneath Johnson Avenue and Kappock Street -- in a neighborhood of apartment towers, many overlooking the Hudson River -- flooded streets, including West 230th Street at the bottom of the hill, which was one of the worst affected. Firefighters built improvised bridges of plywood and the police ferried schoolchildren in vans across the flooded road.</p>
        <p>Few basements were flooded, and officials said that the break caused more inconvenience than damage.</p>
        <p>The pipe burst about 5:30 a.m., and water poured out at the rate of about 60,000 gallons an hour, said Ed Coleman, chief of maintenance for the city's Department of Environmental Protection. It flowed until about 9:25 a.m., down a stretch of Johnson and Irwin Avenues, which run the length of the hill, and engineers struggled to stop it at six different valves before they succeeded, he said.</p>
        <p>The police closed traffic on Johnson and Irwin Avenues and West 230th Street, which was underwater. By 4:30 p.m., the pipe was repaired and the water service, which had been briefly cut off, was restored.</p>
        <p>Several schools were briefly affected by the break, including P.S. 37 and Middle School 141, where D.E.P. officials said they were able to quickly restore service. Another school,  Love Me Tender, a pre-school for special education students, was closed because buses had trouble reaching it.</p>
        <p>The rupture puzzled environmental protection engineers because such breaks are usually caused by excessive water pressure, and the area where this one occurred -- one of the higher elevations in the city -- has some of the lowest water pressure, said Joel A. Miele, the agency's commissioner.</p>
        <p>The Spuyten Duyvil neighborhood is named for the narrow tidal straight at the foot of the cliff on which many of the apartments sit. The name is thought to be a corruption of a Dutch phrase meaning in spite of the devil, referring to the dangerous currents below.</p>
