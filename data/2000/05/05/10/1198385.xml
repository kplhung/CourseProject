        <p>For such a small boy, Elian Gonzalez has had a large, far-reaching impact on the government of a city that was his home for a mere five months. The mayor of Miami, Joe Carollo, a Cuban-American incensed by a federal raid to seize the child, has virtually remade city hall, and the Miami city government is, more than ever, distinctly Cuban.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carollo, who fired City Manager Donald Warshaw after he refused to fire the city's police chief, William O'Brien, in the wake of the raid, has named Carlos Gimenez, a Cuban-American who was the city's fire chief, to be city manager.

        <p>For such a small boy, Elian Gonzalez has had a large, far-reaching impact on the government of a city that was his home for a mere five months. The mayor of Miami, Joe Carollo, a Cuban-American incensed by a federal raid to seize the child, has virtually remade city hall, and the Miami city government is, more than ever, distinctly Cuban.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carollo, who fired City Manager Donald Warshaw after he refused to fire the city's police chief, William O'Brien, in the wake of the raid, has named Carlos Gimenez, a Cuban-American who was the city's fire chief, to be city manager. The move came just a little over a week after Raul Martinez, also a Cuban-American, was named to replace Mr. O'Brien, who resigned in anger.</p>
        <p>Miami now has a Cuban-American mayor, city manager and police chief, as well as a Cuban-American majority -- three of five -- on the City Commission. While Cuban-Americans mostly supported Mr. Carollo's actions, some residents here wonder if such a preponderance of power is good for the already divided city.</p>
        <p>City Hall has been pelted with bananas -- a symbol of what many here see as Miami's ''banana republic'' government -- in the past few days, thrown by Anglos, blacks and some Hispanics who also started a petition to remove Mr. Carollo.</p>
        <p>''A number of people here are concerned and outraged because they believe the city of Miami has lost its balance and equilibrium,'' said Arthur Teele Jr., Miami's only black city commissioner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Teele, like many others here, said Mr. Carollo's government seemed willing to exclude all but Cuban-Americans at a time when passions are running high.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to talk about healing when you are widening the gap,'' Mr. Teele said.</p>
        <p>In the most recent development in Miami's chaotic political landscape, a Miami-Dade County Circuit judge today lifted a temporary injunction that had prevented Mr. Carollo from removing Mr. Warshaw. That cleared the path for the mayor's appointment of Mr. Gimenez.</p>
        <p>Mr. Warshaw, who was appointed by Mr. Carollo two years ago, said the mayor had subjected him to a ''humiliating public execution.'' Both men accused the other of misdeeds, but Circuit Judge Steve Levine ruled that Mr. Carollo, under the city charter, could fire his city manager.</p>
        <p>But it is the impetus for all these drastic changes in city government that has some residents angry.</p>
        <p>The mayor sided with the city's exiles against the federal government in the custody battle to keep Elian in the United States, after the child was found floating on an inner tube off the coast of Fort Lauderdale on Nov. 25.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carollo demanded, in the days after the April 22 raid on the house of Elian's relatives that returned Elian to his father, that Mr. Warshaw fire Mr. O'Brien, who had refused to tell Mr. Carollo about the raid because he was under federal orders and he was afraid the mayor would tip off demonstrators and create chaos.</p>
        <p>Mr. Warshaw refused to fire Mr. O'Brien, a 25-year police veteran, and he himself was fired on April 27.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Brien resigned the next day, saying he could no longer work for the ''divisive'' and ''destructive'' Mr. Carollo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Carollo could not be reached for comment today. Both Mr. Gimenez and Mr. Martinez said they wanted to get on with their jobs. ''We need to put this whole episode behind us,'' Mr. Gimenez said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Martinez said he was proud to be a Cuban-American police chief, ''but more proud to be just the chief of police.''</p>
        <p>Over the past few days, Anglos, blacks and some Hispanics -- mostly those not of Cuban descent -- in Miami and Miami-Dade County have reacted harshly to the exiles' protests of Elian's removal by taking part in counterdemonstrations.</p>
        <p>Many feel they have no voice in a government that, to them, seems to be by, of and for Cuban-Americans, and are angry at protests in which the American flag was flown upside down.</p>
        <p>The city of Miami ''defines diversity and division now,'' said Susan MacManus, a political science professor at the University of South Florida. ''It's not surprising, but it is disheartening to non-Cubans. There could be long-term negative consequences.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gimenez is not seen as a pure political appointee, but as a capable administrator who is respected inside and outside city hall, said James Corey, a political science professor at the University of Miami.</p>
        <p>''He knows the ins and outs of this city's government,'' Mr. Corey said.</p>
        <p>In Miami, where more than 60 percent of voters are Cuban-American, it is inevitable that political appointees will reflect the community, some political experts pointed out.</p>
