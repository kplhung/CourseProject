        <p>WILCOX-Elizabeth, 84, died on May 6th at Evergreen Woods in North Branford, CT. She had lived in Riverdale, New York before retiring in Redding, Connecticut. Her husband of 60 years Herbert B. Wilcox, Jr. M.D., died in 1997. Starting with children's photography, she developed a career that included medical photography as represented in the 100,000 pictures and negatives of the Elizabeth Wilcox Photographic Collection at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. Born in Baltimore, she was the second daughter of Elizabeth Elliott Wilson and Gordon Wilson, M.D., and attended Bryn Mawr School. Her photography included assignments for Time, Newsweek and the Ford Foundation, which supported her work in Africa with Columbia Presbyterian doctors. She later was a Director of Operations Crossroads, and taught photography to its participants. Her work started with pictures of the days of children of officers of the Second General Hospital formed with the staff of Columbia Presbyterian Hospital in World War II. She was recognized in her profession and became an officer of the American Society of Magazine Photographers. Highlights of her career included participation in a select workshop in Santa Cruz, California with Ansel Adams after which she received a Polaroid Foundation grant for related work and a one woman show at the IBM Gallery. She is survived by her sons, Herbert B. Wilcox, III, and his wife Catherine of North Hero, Vermont, Gordon W. Wilcox and his wife Ginger of Seattle, and Thomas E. Wilcox, and his wife Whitney Ransome of Concord, MA and her grandchildren Alexander, Tanya, Virginia, Kate and Christopher. A Memorial Service was held at Christ Church Riverdale on Tuesday. In lieu of flowers, memorial gifts may be sent to the Libby Wilcox Pediatrics Special Needs Fund, C/O Dr. Kenneth A. Forde, 3959 Broadway, BHS102, NY, NY, Columbia University Department of Surgery.</p>
