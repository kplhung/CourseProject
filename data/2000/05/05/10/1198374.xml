        <p>A portrait that Picasso painted in just two and a half hours in 1932 sold at Christie's last night for $28.6 million. While that work brought the highest price, Picassos of different styles and dates accounted for the four top lots in an auction of 20th-century art that several experts described as hot and cold.</p>
        <p>The sale totaled $72.9 million, in the middle of its estimate of $64.3 million to $84 million. Of the 42 works offered, 34 found buyers.</p>
        <p>The evening made less money and sold fewer paintings, drawings and sculptures than Christie's sale of Impressionist and post-Impresssionist art on Monday night, which totaled $104.5 million for 42 sold out of 47 works offered. The big difference was the atmosphere. Monday's bidders were both controlled and controlling in terms of prices. Last night, top-quality works tended to sell far above expectations; less desirable ones were dismissed in short order.</p>
        <p>''It's a strong market, but at the same time not crazy,'' said Christopher Burge, Christie's honorary chairman, who was the evening's auctioneer.</p>
        <p>The sale's one blockbuster -- ''Still Life With Tulips,'' the 1932 Picasso portrait of his mistress Marie-Therese Walter -- appeared to have three serious bidders.</p>
        <p>The painting is particularly unusual: it is both a portrait and a still life. It was painted on March 2, 1932, and on the back Picasso recorded not simply the date but the hours he painted it: 9 to 11:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>Christie's had estimated it would bring $25 million to $30 million and had given the seller, an unidentified European collector who had owned it since 1957, a guarantee (an undisclosed minimum price that an auction house promises the seller regardless of the sale's outcome).</p>
        <p>After the sale, several theories about the identity of the buyer were discussed outside Christie's. Some people sitting directly in front of Mr. Burge said they thought the buyer was a Sammy Ofer, the Israeli shipping magnate. Others said that the winning bid, which was taken by Barbara Strongin, Christie's director of auction operations, was made by Christie's, buying the painting back. Auction house officials would say only that the painting was bought by an ''anonymous buyer.''</p>
        <p>Two of the four Picassos sold well above their estimates. ''Head of a Woman With Bangs,'' painted on June 2, 1938, was estimated at $2 million to $3 million. Five bidders tried hard to take home the decorative portrait of the artist's mistress Dora Maar. It eventually sold to an unidentified bidder for $4.5 million.</p>
        <p>A far later Picasso, ''The Painter and His Model,'' executed from April 2 to 6, 1963, shows the artist armed with a palette and brush sitting at his easel painting a nude model facing him. Six bidders went for the painting, estimated at $1.5 million to $2 million. It was finally sold for $3.7 million to Franck Giraud, Christie's head of 19th- and 20th-century art worldwide, bidding by telephone for an unidentified client.</p>
        <p>Picasso's ''Bust of Woman Seated on a Chair,'' painted on Oct. 12, 1939, also brought a high price, though not as high as Christie's had hoped. Another unidentified telephone bidder bought it for $4.7 million, just over its low estimate of $4.5 million.</p>
        <p>(Final prices include Christie's commission, 17.5 percent of the first $80,000 plus 10 percent of any amount above that. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)</p>
        <p>One record was set last night, for a drawing by Matisse. ''Study for 'Pink Nude' '' (1935) attracted a seven determined bidders. A preparatory drawing for a painting in the Cone Collection at the Baltimore Museum of Art, it was expected to bring $1 million to $1.5 million but was finally bought for $2.7 million by a gray-haired man glued to a cell phone, whom Christie's described as a European dealer.</p>
        <p>Not everything did so well for Christie's. It had guaranteed a Cy Twombly painting, ''Untitled'' (1968), one of the few works in the artist's blackboard series executed on a white background. It was estimated at $3 million to $4 million. Several people tried to buy it, but only for the right price. It went to an unidentified telephone bidder for $2.8 million.</p>
        <p>Franz Kline's ''Untitled'' (1958), a 52-by-91-inch example of the Abstract Expressionist painter's black-and-white compositions, was estimated at $2.2 million to $3.2 million. No one lifted a paddle, and Mr. Burge stopped trying at $1.6 million.</p>
        <p>Also unsold was Andy Warhol's 1963 portrait of Elizabeth Taylor, estimated at $1.8 million to $2.5 million; it never drew a bid higher than $1.2 million. But ''The Kiss (Bela Lugosi),'' a 1964 Warhol silkscreen on paper, soared. Two determined bidders went for it, and it sold for $798,000, far above its $600,000 high estimate. The buyer was Lucy Mitchell-Innes, a Manhattan dealer. Executed from a film still, this scene from the 1931 ''Dracula.''</p>
        <p>People leaving the sale last night were interested to see the way prices tended to go up and down. ''For top-quality things, people were willing to fight like cats and dogs, and price was no object,'' said Abigail Asher, a private dealer in Manhattan. ''For things of lesser quality, the price had to be right.''</p>
