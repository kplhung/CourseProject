        <p>For all the inroads jazz has made into concert halls, the music's mythic home is still an out-of-the-way little bar where saxophone lines entwine with curling wisps of smoke. That's fine with Roy Nathanson, the alto saxophonist in the Jazz Passengers. He has just released ''Fire at Keaton's Bar and Grill'' (Six Degrees), a jazzy song cycle set in a fictitious dive.</p>
        <p>Its characters, some portrayed by jazz-leaning rock singers including Elvis Costello and Deborah Harry, are a batch of barflies -- lovers, watchers, poets, musicians and lost souls -- reminiscing about a place that one of them may have burned down. It was staged, with videos by the director John Jesurun, at St. Ann's in Brooklyn for three weekend shows.</p>

        <p>For all the inroads jazz has made into concert halls, the music's mythic home is still an out-of-the-way little bar where saxophone lines entwine with curling wisps of smoke. That's fine with Roy Nathanson, the alto saxophonist in the Jazz Passengers. He has just released ''Fire at Keaton's Bar and Grill'' (Six Degrees), a jazzy song cycle set in a fictitious dive.</p>
        <p>Its characters, some portrayed by jazz-leaning rock singers including Elvis Costello and Deborah Harry, are a batch of barflies -- lovers, watchers, poets, musicians and lost souls -- reminiscing about a place that one of them may have burned down. It was staged, with videos by the director John Jesurun, at St. Ann's in Brooklyn for three weekend shows.</p>
        <p>A video screen above the stage showed barroom scenes, blurred squiggles of neon or abstract billows of smoke, rippling water, clouds and climbing flames behind close-ups of the musicians. The singers wore slightly retro outfits -- hats were carefully slouched -- and Ms. Harry, as the bartender, sang ''Imitation of a Kiss'' while holding a barkeep's dishcloth. But more of the atmosphere came from Mr. Nathanson's time-warped music.</p>
        <p>He is fondest of jazz from the mid-1950's to the mid-60's, when a place like Keaton's would have an organ trio playing nightly, and when band leaders like Charles Mingus and Art Blakey developed ways to put a bluesy, down-home foundation under complex structures. Mr. Nathanson has a gift for counterpoint, meshing irregular riffs to mix spaciousness and propulsion. And he doesn't let one idiom contain him; the song cycle included unaccompanied saxophone quartets, unconventional funk tunes and a modernist tango.</p>
        <p>A few of the songs were direct throwbacks, like ''Bar Stool Paradise,'' which recalled the 1950's vocalese of Lambert, Hendricks and Ross; Nancy King and Kenny Washington made it sound like a jovial improvisation. But more often, Mr. Nathanson added extra twists: odd meters, ambiguous chords, stretches of altered funk. The easy-swinging riff of ''Jazz Night at Keaton's'' switched between 5/4 and 7/4 time, then steamed into doubletime, letting Reuben Wilson on organ send quick lines charging across the beat in classic organ-trio style.</p>
        <p>Even the ballads -- which, anywhere else, could have been torch songs -- challenged the singers with tricky chromatic leaps. Mr. Costello handled his songs with an intimate vibrato; Ms. Harry sounded worldly and resilient, even as she spoke-sang phrases between the pointillistic dissonances of ''Cups.'' Darius de Haas and David Driver crooned a ''A Bend in the Night,'' the poised, slow-motion love duet of two theoretical physicists: ''a quantum embrace/let particles fly.''</p>
        <p>''Fire at Keaton's Bar and Grill'' didn't try to recreate a bygone place and time. Instead, true to nostalgia's version of jazz past, it took memory loosely, letting creative distortion improve things.</p>
