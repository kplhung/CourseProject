        <p>GREAT red Burgundy is a tantalizing abstraction for most people, imagined but not tasted. Only small quantities of the best wines are made each year, and many of those bottles are reserved for collectors and others who don't mind the stratospheric prices.</p>
        <p>Everybody else is left with written descriptions that amount to reading the music without hearing the symphony.</p>
        <p>That scarcity, along with the unpredictable quality of so many  bottles, makes hunting Burgundies a frustrating experience. And yet, few Burgundy lovers abandon the quest, because the rewards of silky textures and seductive flavors are so great.</p>
        <p>Too often, their focus is solely on wines from the best-known areas, where the storied, melodious names -- Gevrey-Chambertin, Vosne-Romanee and Chambolle-Musigny, for example -- conjure up the wine's romance.</p>
        <p>For determined trackers, though, a whole other side of Burgundy exists, where grapes grown in less familiar places like Monthelie, St.-Aubin and Auxey-Duresses produce wines that may not have the stature or power of the best Burgundies but are thoroughly enjoyable. They are also definite bargains compared with similarly priced wines from the better known regions.</p>
        <p>Buying a good Burgundy does not end the hunt, however; pouring a glass starts the chase again. Pinot noir, the grape of red Burgundy, makes wines that are maddeningly elusive, changing by the minute in the glass. The first sip from a just-opened bottle can be gloriously sweet and fruity, but then the wine seems to close, putting up a tart boundary that fends off efforts to get at the flavors within.</p>
        <p>Let the glass sit 20 or 30 minutes, though, and it transforms again. The flavors deepen, with bass notes of chocolate and anise  underlying the higher fruit and herbal flavors.</p>
        <p>Taming these wines is out of the question. The only choice seems to be acceptance. Burgundy, after all, is a beast, not a pet.</p>
