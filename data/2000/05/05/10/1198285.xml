        <p>Time is a peculiar thing in opera. An aria or ensemble lasting 10 minutes might convey only a few lines of text and do little either to advance the plot or to deepen the audience's sense of the characters. But when stage time is more limited, a composer and librettist can spin quite a yarn in 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>Last season Jonathan Sheffer and his Eos Orchestra presented six works from the contemporary end of the mini-opera repertory, and they clearly found it a vein worth mining further. On Thursday evening at the Society for Ethical Culture, Mr. Sheffer led a sequel, ''Six 10-Minute Operas II.'' This time he expanded his purview: Monteverdi and Salieri represented the 17th and 18th centuries; three works were composed during the 1920's; and Jake Heggie's ''Again'' was commissioned by Eos and completed this year.</p>

        <p>Time is a peculiar thing in opera. An aria or ensemble lasting 10 minutes might convey only a few lines of text and do little either to advance the plot or to deepen the audience's sense of the characters. But when stage time is more limited, a composer and librettist can spin quite a yarn in 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>Last season Jonathan Sheffer and his Eos Orchestra presented six works from the contemporary end of the mini-opera repertory, and they clearly found it a vein worth mining further. On Thursday evening at the Society for Ethical Culture, Mr. Sheffer led a sequel, ''Six 10-Minute Operas II.'' This time he expanded his purview: Monteverdi and Salieri represented the 17th and 18th centuries; three works were composed during the 1920's; and Jake Heggie's ''Again'' was commissioned by Eos and completed this year.</p>
        <p>The format was similar to last year's. With Robin Guarino directing, the works were presented virtually without pause (except for a single intermission), as if they were vignettes in a revue. That might seem a risky notion, given the variety of styles involved, but Mr. Sheffer, Ms. Guarino and the singers made it work by leaning on a series of themes that tied these disparate pieces together.</p>
        <p>At the most basic level, they were all battles of the sexes: in Monteverdi's ''Combattimento di Tancredi e Clorinda'' -- not really an opera, but here reconfigured persuasively to seem like one -- the battle is literal. In Salieri's ''Kleine Harlekinade'' and Ernst Toch's ''Egon und Emilie,'' it was psychological, and in Mr. Heggie's ''Again'' -- a version of ''I Love Lucy'' in which Ricky is a wife-beater -- it was both.</p>
        <p>Identity was a unifying theme as well. In the Monteverdi, the armored combatants are unknown to each other until Clorinda is mortally wounded. Salieri's Columbine disguises herself as a witch to expose the shallowness of her two suitors. In Milhaud's ''L'Enlevement d'Europe,'' the bull with which Europa is infatuated turns out to be Jupiter in disguise. Karl Amadeus Hartmann's ghoulish comedy, ''Die Witwe von Ephesus,'' ends with a widow's substituting her husband's body for that of a hanged (but still living) man whom she found attractive. And Mr. Heggie's work ends with an appealing quartet in which Lucy, Ricky, Fred and Ethel mull the effect of television reruns, which freeze their identities for better and for worse.</p>
        <p>Of the singers, Sheri Greenawald, the soprano, had the most rewarding material -- Emilie's virtuosic aria in the Toch and the widow in the Hartmann -- and she sang it with ample color. Susannah Waters, also a soprano, gave strong characterizations of Columbine and Lucy, and sang the ascending final line of Clorinda's music affectingly. The other singers -- Kimberly Barber, mezzo-soprano; Matthew Chellis and Steven Goldstein, tenors; Robert Sapolsky, baritone; and Dean Ely, bass-baritone -- all made fine contributions as well.</p>
        <p>The succession of works was a good test of Mr. Sheffer's flexibility and that of his freelance Eos players. The first half moved quickly from Monteverdi's Baroque textures to Salieri's Classicism and Toch's beautifully complex wind scoring; the lush Neo-Romanticism of the Milhaud gave way to Hartmann's arch Expressionism and the easygoing eclectic lyricism of Mr. Heggie's music. The musicians moved easily among these styles.</p>
        <p>MUSIC REVIEW  Correction:  May 11, 2000, Thursday  A picture caption yesterday with a review of ''Six 10-Minute Operas II,'' performed by Jonathan Sheffer and the Eos Orchestra at the Society for Ethical Culture last Thursday evening, misidentified the singer who played Jupiter disguised as a bull in Milhaud's ''Enlevement d'Europe.'' He was Matthew Chellis, not Steven Goldstein.</p>
