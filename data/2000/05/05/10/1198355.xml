        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki went to Nassau County today offering a $100 million state bailout to help one of the nation's wealthiest counties avert financial ruin.</p>
        <p>In return, the debt-ridden county has to allow the state to monitor its finances and future budgets and agree to make large spending cuts over the next four years.</p>
        <p>If the county fails to make the required spending cuts -- $50 million this year and an additional $70 million in each of the next three years -- the state will withhold the aid and impose a more powerful financial control board with the power to tell the county what cuts to make and even to abrogate civil service contracts.</p>
        <p>''It is a carrot and stick,'' Governor Pataki said as he announced the plan, which he said could restore the county to fiscal stability without raising taxes. His proposal requires the approval of county officials and the State Legislature; leaders of both parties on both levels of government reacted favorably to the plan today and said they expected it to pass.</p>
        <p>The governor took the extraordinary steps of intervening in the affairs of a local government -- and of pledging millions in state aid to the wealthy county -- after years of unbalanced budgeting left Nassau County running out of money during one of the longest periods of economic prosperity in the nation's history.</p>
        <p>The plan would include $100 million in state aid spread out over five years and would set up a financial authority with the ability to sell new bonds, guaranteed by the county's sales tax revenue. That would allow Nassau County to borrow money at a lower interest rate than the county, whose bonds are hovering just above junk status, can now get on its own. The arrangement is intended to buy the county time while it makes severe, long-term spending cuts.</p>
        <p>In announcing his fiscal recovery plan, the governor said that he wanted to ensure that a county of vital economic importance to the state did not go bankrupt. Credit rating agencies have already threatened to reduce the county's bond rating to junk status if it does not put a financial plan in place by June 30.</p>
        <p>Wall Street reacted guardedly. ''This gives them more time, but it highlights the necessity to come up with real, ongoing changes in the fiscal operation of the county,'' said  Steven Murphy, a managing director at Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit rating agency.</p>
        <p>But the governor's actions have a political impact as well: the fiscal crisis already led Nassau County, long one of the state's most solid Republican bastions, to elect a Democratic majority to its County Legislature in November. And Republicans fear that continuing anger over the county's finances could mean more losses this November in races for the State Legislature, the United States Senate and the presidency.</p>
        <p>The plan that was announced today has been in the works since March, when Governor Pataki appointed Frank G. Zarb, the chairman of the group that runs the Nasdaq stock exchange, as his special adviser on Nassau County. Mr. Zarb found that the county's 2000 budget of $2.2 billion was $178 million short, and that if no action were taken the deficit would balloon to $233 million next year and $321 million by 2003.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zarb painted a grim portrait of Nassau's fiscal practices, noting that the county had become increasingly dependent on selling off its assets and borrowing money through bonds to meet its expenses, which have grown drastically as its spending far outpaced the rate of inflation. The county is now $2.7 billion in debt; Mr. Zarb found that the county spent roughly one out of every five dollars servicing its debt.</p>
        <p>And he noted that Nassau's antiquated property tax system -- the county has already agreed to overhaul it -- had forced it to borrow $800 million to pay refunds to people who successfully challenged their taxes, and to pay interest on that money.</p>
        <p>To put the county back on its feet, the governor proposed the creation of the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, which would sell new bonds backed by the county's sales tax at a lower cost to the county and refinance the county's existing debt so that it could be paid back in smaller installments over a longer time.</p>
        <p>In return, the authority would have the power to monitor the county's finances.</p>
        <p>If the county met its obligations, it would get $100 million in state aid  over the next five years, and the state would give the county an additional $5 million to hire lawyers and assessors to help the county reduce its backlog of tax refund claims.</p>
        <p>But if the county failed to immediately cut $50 million in spending and adopt a balanced four-year financial plan, the state would appoint a control board with the power to tell the county what cuts to make.</p>
        <p>Just where the county's cuts would come from -- $260 million over four years -- was far from clear. In recent days Democrats and Republicans have met to discuss possible cuts, including $10 million to the county's Police Department, reductions of county contracts, the abolition of one county agency and the mergers of others.</p>
        <p>Such plans are unusual. Noting how rare it is for a state to bail out a foundering local government, David Liebschutz, an adjunct professor at Rockefeller College at the State University at Albany, invoked the other famous case of a wealthy suburb in distress: Orange County, Calif., which went bankrupt in 1994 after losing $2 billion on bad investments. ''They asked for help and the state basically said to them, 'Tough, you work it out, you have the resources,' '' he said. ''That tends to be the approach.''</p>
        <p>New York State came to the rescue of New York City in 1975, Yonkers in 1975 and 1984, and Troy in 1994. But the scale of the assistance proposed for Nassau County is unusual, and it is even rarer for the state to establish a fiscal monitor and create a new agency to help the county borrow money.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki's plan was generally welcomed today by the Nassau County executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, and both Democrats and Republicans on the County Legislature.</p>
        <p>Nassau County Democrats have called for a fiscal monitor for more than a year, even after they won control of the County Legislature in November. This year, at their urging, the Democratic-controlled State Assembly passed a bill that would have created a fiscal monitor with powers similar to the finance authority the governor proposed today.</p>
        <p>Judith A. Jacobs, a Democrat who is the presiding officer of the County Legislature, said that while she would still need to see more details of the plan, she approved of its broad outlines and expected it to pass.</p>
        <p>''It gives us good outside help putting Nassau County back on sure footing, but it doesn't remove from us the responsibilities of good government,'' she said of the proposal.</p>
        <p>Peter J. Schmitt, the Republican  leader, said unequivocally that his caucus would support the plan. And Mr. Gulotta, the county executive, said that if he were given one word to describe the plan, the word would be ''perfect.''</p>
        <p>Once the County Legislature and the executive formally ask the state to adopt a proposal, the plan will go to Albany for approval.</p>
        <p>Sheldon Silver, a Democrat who is the Assembly speaker, said he was favorably disposed to the plan, noting its similarities to a bill calling for oversight that the Assembly had already passed. And he said that while the prospect of giving $100 million to a wealthy county might raise eyebrows, he thought it could be worked out.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, there are other parts of the state that are in need of assistance as well,'' he said, ''but we pull together for people who are in need.''</p>
        <p>State Senator Dean Skelos, the deputy leader of the Republican majority, praised the plan as well.</p>
        <p>Privately, some county leaders wondered where they would find $260 million in recurring spending cuts over the next four years.</p>
