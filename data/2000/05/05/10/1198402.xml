        <p>A V-22 Osprey crashed on a training mission in Arizona last month because the pilot was bringing the aircraft down for a landing so fast that its helicopter rotors encountered the turbulence they created beneath themselves, and one of the two rotors lost lift as a result, the Marine Corps said today.</p>
        <p>Discussing the finding at a news conference, Lt. Gen. Fred McCorkle, assistant chief of staff for Marine aviation, said investigators ''have found no mechanical or software failures'' that might have caused the crash, which killed all 19 people aboard the Osprey, a tilt-rotor craft that takes off and lands like a helicopter but cruises like a fixed-wing plane.</p>
        <p>Although he said an analysis of the crash showed that the Osprey had been descending too quickly, General McCorkle declined to attribute it to pilot error, noting that the investigation was still under way.</p>
        <p>The crash occurred little more than four weeks ago, far less than the months it typically takes the Defense Department to make information about crash inquiries public. But in the case of the Osprey, which has been in development for 20 years, the Pentagon is eager to resume flights in order to prepare for full-scale production of the craft this fall. General McCorkle said the Marines were ''rock solid'' on plans to resume Osprey flights soon, probably on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Although the $44-million-apiece Osprey has a long and troubled history, Pentagon officials defended it emphatically today. They said the crash was not related to the aircraft's hybrid nature and could have happened to any helicopter.</p>
        <p>The crash was the third for the Osprey. The first, in June 1991, injured two people and was traced to incorrect wiring. The second, a year later, killed all seven aboard and was caused by an engine fire that in turn resulted from a leak of gear-box oil.</p>
        <p>The most recent crash, on April 7 at a small airport in Marana, Ariz., near Tucson, occurred on a mission in which marines were training for evacuations. The Osprey's builders -- Boeing, Bell Textron and Allison Engine -- have described it as particularly well suited to evacuation missions, since it has a range that is characteristic of a fixed-wing plane but does not need a runway. It can carry 18 to 24 troops.</p>
        <p>The craft that crashed was the second of a pair of Ospreys that were to land at Marana, and investigators are still looking at an alternative to their belief that the accident was caused by a descent that was too rapid. This other possibility is that turbulence from the first Osprey interfered with the second. As a result of the crash, the Marines have ordered that for the time being, Ospreys stay at least 200 feet from each other horizontally and that one not descend within 50 feet in front of another.</p>
        <p>But General McCorkle said the investigators thought that the pilot had simply been flying the craft ''outside the flight envelope.'' The Osprey was descending at a rate of more than 1,000 feet a minute, and is not supposed to exceed 800 feet a minute when the forward speed is less than 40 knots. According to the investigators, the Osprey that crashed was moving forward at a speed of less than 40 knots in the five-second period before the crash. (At higher forward speeds, a helicopter can avoid the downdraft created by its rotors.)</p>
        <p>General McCorkle said the doomed Osprey had entered a ''vortex ring state,'' in which the rotor blades were circulating disturbed air and failing to generate lift. At higher altitudes, a pilot can cut power to move forward faster and escape a vortex. But data from on-board recorders indicate that when the Osprey dropped below 40 knots of forward speed, it was less than 350 feet above the ground. The pilot banked the craft slightly to the right to refine his course, and then the right rotor lost lift and the Osprey flipped over.</p>
        <p>General McCorkle said the pilot, Maj. John A. Brow, 39, was ''highly experienced,'' although he had logged only 85 hours in the Osprey, plus 100 hours in an Osprey simulator.</p>
        <p>In response to a question, General McCorkle said he did not know whether the Osprey simulator used for training had been programmed to reproduce the vortex ring effect. But investigators found that the programming was insufficient to recreate the accident on the simulator, he said.</p>
        <p>When flights resume, he said, one task will be to take the Osprey to high altitudes, from which recovery is possible, and force it into the vortex ring state to see how it performs.</p>
        <p>He said that in a demonstration of the Pentagon's confidence in the Osprey, Gen. Jim Jones, the commandant of the Marine Corps, and Gen. Mike Ryan, the chief of staff of the Air Force, which also uses the craft, had volunteered to be first when the Ospreys resume carrying passengers.</p>
