        <p>THE SENATE</p>
        <p>KENNEDY FOE IN TROUBLE -- Jack E. Robinson III, the ill-fated Republican challenger for Edward M. Kennedy's Senate seat, faces a new adversity, and one potentially fatal for his campaign. As of 5 p.m. yesterday, the Massachusetts secretary of state's office had certified only 5,122 of the 10,000 signatures Mr. Robinson needed by that hour to officially qualify to run. So unless he has some 5,000 signatures stashed out there that can readily and unquestionably be certified, he has failed to make the ballot, said the secretary of state, William F. Galvin. ''It's very much up in the air whether he will make it or not,'' Mr. Galvin said. If he does not, Mr. Galvin added, it would mean that Massachusetts Republicans had failed to field a United States Senate candidate for the first time since senators were first elected by popular vote, back in 1916. Mr. Robinson offered no explanation for what happened to his signature-gathering effort or his campaign in general -- a campaign he had sworn to continue despite a raft of damaging accusations and incidents, including traffic troubles and bad behavior toward women. Senator Kennedy has faced a Republican challenger in every campaign since he was first elected to the Senate in 1964.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>SWITCHING TO DEMOCRATS -- It is not clear yet whether it is a real trend, and if so why, but the conversion of Southern Republicans to the Democratic Party may be spreading. It began last month with two South Carolina legislators. Then a few days ago, a Georgia state representative, Randy Sauder, who represents the Atlanta suburb of Smyrna, became the first Georgia Republican in 16 years to switch to the Democrats. Another Republican state legislator, Buddy DeLoach of Hinesville, is becoming an independent. Mr. Sauder, who switched just before the filing deadline to prevent any Republicans from running against him, said he was disappointed in the Republican Party's rigidity on issues like education. Republicans vowed to run one of their own against him as an independent candidate. Over the past few decades, those switching parties in the South were mostly Democrats turning Republican.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>EYE ON 2004 RACE? -- Though this year's presidential primary season is not officially over, a coming fund-raiser in Georgia is already stoking speculation about races four years or so down the road. Next Monday, Jeanne Shaheen, the Democratic governor of New Hampshire, will be the beneficiary of an event in Atlanta -- a bit south of Concord -- that planners hope will raise at least $25,000 for her re-election. And one of the hosts, as well as one of the contributors, will be Georgia's governor, Roy Barnes, a first-term Democrat who is beginning to win national attention for his policies on improving schools and limiting sprawl. Robert S. Kahn, Mr. Barnes's chief of staff, says his boss was simply supporting a fellow Democratic governor, not pocketing a chit to be cashed later, in time for New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary in 2004 or 2008. ''The only election he's interested in, other than legislative elections, is his own re-election,'' Mr. Kahn insisted. The event is being organized by Michael Coles, a prominent party fund-raiser and Barnes ally who met Ms. Shaheen while working for Vice President Al Gore in New Hampshire last winter.</p>
