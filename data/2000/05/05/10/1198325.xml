        <p>Responding to Microsoft's public criticisms of the plan to break it in two, the assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's antitrust division said today that the actual result would be ''exciting new products, with more choices and lower prices for consumers.''</p>
        <p>The official, Joel I. Klein, added that Microsoft's key argument ''is wrong as a matter of fact, and wrong as a matter of history as well.'' He was speaking at a forum on the new economy at the University of California at Berkeley.</p>
        <p>Late last month, the Justice Department and 17 state attorneys general asked a federal judge to break Microsoft into two companies. One would hold the Windows operating system, the other everything else, including the Office suite of application programs like Word and Excel.</p>
        <p>Over the last 10 days, Microsoft has responded publicly with blistering criticism of the plan. On Wednesday, its legal response is due in federal court.</p>
        <p>Microsoft has asserted, among other things, that the integration of its operating system and applications software divisions into one company produces efficiencies that bring innovation. Mr. Klein said that argument ''is wrong as a matter of fact, since the two companies would be free to exchange technical information, as long as that information was made available to third parties.''</p>
        <p>He added that Microsoft ''has long claimed that it provided third-party applications developers all the information about its operating system that those developers could need'' to write software programs for Windows. If that is true, he said, ''there is no real loss of efficiency in the reorganization.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Klein also said that opponents of the breakup of AT&amp;T in 1984 ''made the very same claim, arguing that the divestiture would imperil the efficiency of the telephone network.'' He said ''that argument has failed the test of time.''</p>
        <p>Elaborating on the AT&amp;T comparison, Mr. Klein disputed another Microsoft argument: that it was not the breakup that freed AT&amp;T to compete, but the order to deregulate it.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Klein noted that AT&amp;T and the Baby Bells were left with restrictions prohibiting them from entering one another's markets. Under the plan to break up Microsoft, he said, ''the separated companies would be entirely free to compete with each other in all lines of business.''</p>
