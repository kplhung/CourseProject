        <p>The Miami Heat missed one free throw after another in tonight's loss to the Knicks. Fourteen misses in 33 attempts. Heat guard Dan Majerle said it became a psychological challenge to make a free throw.</p>
        <p>''You don't worry when you miss a couple,'' Majerle said after the Heat's 82-76 loss to the Knicks at American Airlines Arena. ''Then it goes to three and four. The crowd starts getting into it.</p>
        <p>''It gets everybody thinking about it.''</p>
        <p>After a pause, Majerle said, ''There are some other things we could have done better, of course, but I think that's one definite place where we lost the game.''</p>
        <p>The power forward P. J. Brown was mystified how the Heat could miss seven straight free throws spanning the first and second quarters.</p>
        <p>''All we do in practice is take free throws,'' he said. ''Free throws are all mental. I don't know what happened. I just know we've got our work cut out for us now, but it's nothing we haven't been able to handle before.''</p>
        <p>The four-of-seven-game Eastern Conference semifinal series is tied at one victory apiece.</p>
        <p>''I think we beat ourselves tonight,'' Heat guard Tim Hardaway said. ''That's the way I feel about it. We played good defense, we rebounded. They just made their foul shots and we didn't. When the first person steps up there and misses them, it becomes contagious.''</p>
        <p>Alonzo Mourning, the Heat's All-Star center, pointed an accusing finger at himself. He missed 13 of 18 field-goal attempts and 6 of 13 free throws. Hardaway suggested that Mourning might have attempted too many jump shots tonight, rather than driving more to the basket.</p>
        <p>''I think he's right,'' Mourning said. ''I take personal responsibility for this loss. I should have been more patient out there. You would think I've been in the league long enough to understand that, but if the ball's going to be in my hands, which it is, I'm going to have to learn more patience in a hurry.''</p>
        <p>Mourning went silent for a moment, then said: ''Write these words down. We will play better Friday night.''</p>
        <p>That's when the series resumes at Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>By halftime tonight, the Heat's field-goal percentage was better than its free-throw percentage.</p>
        <p>''It was somewhat of a surreal game for me to watch,'' Heat Coach Pat Riley said. ''We did everything we had to do from a defensive and a rebounding standpoint. Offensively, we were just horrendous.''</p>
        <p>Hardaway added, ''At halftime, we should have had a 3- or 4-point lead and then it would have been a different ballgame.''</p>
        <p>The ghosts seemingly exorcised by Jamal Mashburn and Mourning in Game 1 popped back into view tonight. Mashburn, the Heat's scoring-minded small forward, has a habit of performing poorly against the Knicks, particularly in the playoffs. Tonight, he set the tone by going 1 for 7 from the field in the first quarter. Mashburn had 12 points after three quarters, but as the Knicks pulled away in the fourth, he helped the Heat finish respectably, scoring 13 for a misleading 25-point total.</p>
        <p>''I can't worry about how I'm playing,'' he said. ''The way I approach it is, I've just got to keep working to make something happen.''</p>
        <p>Mourning, meanwhile, finally in position to step out of the huge shadow created by his longtime friend and fellow Georgetown alumnus Patrick Ewing, also suffered through a forgettable game. He had 17 points, 9 fewer than he had on Sunday as Miami won Game 1, 87-83.</p>
        <p>Ewing had 13 points in 10 fewer minutes.</p>
        <p>Mourning has always revered Ewing, even crediting the Knicks center with leading him to basketball. After watching Georgetown and North Carolina play for the 1982 national collegiate title, Mourning, then 12, was so inspired by Ewing's play that he decided to give up football for basketball.</p>
        <p>He usually plays reasonably well against Ewing, but Ewing usually plays better. That's why their April 9 meeting was so important. Mourning outscored him, 33-13.</p>
        <p>He outscored Ewing, 26-17, in Game 1, so tonight represented more of a sobering return to the norm.</p>
