        <p>When Aleksandr Petrov returned home from Hollywood in April with an Oscar tucked  into his suitcase, he was almost crushed on the platform at the Yaroslavl train station by a crowd of friends, fans, television cameras and flower-wielding officials.</p>
        <p>Taken aback, Mr. Petrov, a soft-spoken man of 42, referred all questions to his wife, Natasha. It fell to her to make an obvious point, which, according to reporters who were present, went something like this: ''Now you are falling all over us, but where were you before when we needed you?''</p>
        <p>The Oscar ceremonies on March 26 were held the same night that Vladimir V. Putin was elected Russia's second president. So it took a day or so for the Russian press to turn its attention to Mr. Petrov and his 22-minute film, ''The Old Man and the Sea,'' a strikingly beautiful adaptation of the Hemingway book, literally hand-painted on glass, which won the Oscar for best short animated film.</p>
        <p>Then the floodgates opened, and Mr. Petrov was swept up in a wave of emotion as Russians seized on his Oscar as a victory for a culture, a tradition and a pool of artistic talent that has managed to survive despite the difficulties of the last decade.</p>
        <p>''Thank you, thank you,'' said a woman with tears running down her cheeks, as she clutched Mr. Petrov's arm after a special showing of his films in Moscow at the  House of Cinema, the epicenter of the Russian film world. ''At last someone has shown that we are still here, still working.''</p>
        <p>At home in Yaroslavl, brushing the dust off equipment in his tiny studio at the back of a dilapidated amateur film club, Mr. Petrov is still puzzling over how he ended up a national hero.</p>
        <p>''In the eyes of simple people, it is a victory for all of Russia, something like a prize for football, or a sports prize,'' he said. ''Russia has gone through a long period when its authority was weakened, and people feel bad about that. That's why any prize, any victory, revives them.''</p>
        <p>''For me this was all unexpected,'' he went on. ''I accept the Oscars with irony -- no, that's the wrong word; with understanding. It is an exceptional prize, but it is not something on a state level.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. Petrov's achievement reflects both the advantages and drawbacks of working as a filmmaker in today's Russia. On the one hand Mr. Petrov -- widely acknowledged as the world master of a rare and difficult animation technique, a filmmaker who has been nominated for an Oscar three times -- did finally win the industry's top award, an honor that has eluded previous generations of Russian animators.</p>
        <p>On the other hand he received no financial support, public or private, in Russia. The film, which took three years to make and cost an extravagant $2.2 million because of its 70-millimeter Imax format, was made in Canada, produced by Productions Pascal Blais, a Montreal company, and sponsored by Japanese backers.</p>
        <p>''A prophet without honor in his own land,'' said Yulian F. Nadezhdin, the cultural affairs reporter for Northern Region, the main newspaper of Yaroslavl, an ancient Volga River city.</p>
        <p>Many people in Yaroslavl had never even heard of Mr. Petrov, even though his earlier films -- ''The Cow,'' ''The Mermaid'' and  ''The Dream of a Ridiculous Man'' -- had won awards in Russia. These films have been shown in the local theater over the years, but the seats were filled mostly with Mr. Petrov's friends. When he returned  eight years ago to the city of his childhood -- he was born in a village outside of Yaroslavl -- city officials listened coolly to his requests for assistance and turned him down.</p>
        <p>''Maybe it wasn't the right time; the country then was really in a bad way,'' Mr. Petrov said. ''Even the big movie studios were collapsing, so I can understand the reasoning of the city fathers. For them, my requests were just empty noise.''</p>
        <p>Now the tune has changed. In Moscow a hesitant and clearly nervous Mr. Petrov was applauded and feted by the capital's cultural elite at the House of Cinema, introduced triumphantly by Russia's other Oscar winner, Nikita Mikhalkov (''Burnt by the Sun,'' Oscar for best foreign-language film, 1995), and heralded with a telegram from  Mr. Putin, then the president-elect.</p>
        <p>Officials in Mr. Petrov's hometown, acknowledging their neglect, said they would try to help. ''They didn't promise any golden mountains,'' Mr. Petrov said. ''But they said they would support me. We shall see.''</p>
        <p>He does not need much room to make his films, just enough to paint on backlighted plates of glass that are wiped clean after each painting is committed to film. Trained as a classical artist at the Voronezh Arts School and later as a filmmaker at a Moscow institute, Mr. Petrov long ago forsook brushes for his own hands: with a few deft movements of his fingers, thumbs or even the heel of his palm, he creates faces, hands, legs, trees, sky and the shifting moods of a Russian lake during the spring thaw or a Caribbean sea at sunset.</p>
        <p>The effect is fluid, lyrical, almost magical. ''It is like sitting in a museum looking at a painting, and suddenly the painting tells a story,'' said Bernard Lajoie, the Montreal producer who decided in 1996 to back Mr. Petrov's production of ''The Old Man and the Sea.''</p>
        <p>Not only did the Canadians finance the film, but they decided -- together with their Japanese backers -- to film it in a large format that they thought would lend itself to the marine scenes that make up most of the movie.</p>
        <p>''The Old Man and the Sea,'' scheduled for release in the United States in September, is the first animated film to be produced for Imax theaters, an experiment that initially made everyone involved in the project uneasy. ''I was nervous and my producers were nervous, although we didn't tell each other until the end,'' Mr. Petrov said. ''I was worried that my fingerprints would show on the gigantic screen.''</p>
        <p>Shooting the film for a large format added to the cost and complexity of the project; laboratory expenses alone came to $500,000,  Mr. Lajoie said. Mr. Petrov -- with his wife; his 20-year-old son and assistant, Dmitri;  and his cameraman, Sergei Rechetnikov -- spent two and a half years in Montreal on the agonizing process of producing the painted film frame by frame.</p>
        <p>To ease the task, Mr. Petrov's Canadian producers provided him with a specially designed computerized animation stand that allowed him to see previous frames as he worked. But the rest of the work was done painstakingly by hand: more than 29,000 frames, each of them complex paintings, 8 to 12 of them for each second of film. The sequencing was first mapped out in pencil sketches, but the frame-to-frame continuity is something that Mr. Petrov kept in his head, or rather, in his mind's eye.</p>
        <p>''It is not a very professional approach,'' he said. ''If I worked for Disney they would have thrown me out a long time ago. There is no discipline in my approach; I make the changes as I go along.''</p>
        <p>In an industry addicted to hype and self-publicity, Mr. Petrov comes across as a kind of antihero, all modesty and self-deprecation. At the Oscars he spoke a few words of English before lapsing apologetically into Russian. Once back in Russia, he seemed literally stunned by the press attention and has been loath to use his sudden celebrity to toot any horn, let alone his own.</p>
        <p>His hopes, like his complaints, are low-key. He would like to open a studio for local animators, although he is not sure who would use it, except perhaps some of the children who attend classes at the Sea Gull film club. He is taking his time before committing himself to his next project, but he knows this much: next time, he wants to stay in Yaroslavl.</p>
        <p>When he was working in Canada, some of his friends predicted that he would end up staying abroad, like so many other Russian artists.</p>
        <p>But he knew different. ''I always wanted to come home,'' he said. ''And I did. That seems to mean something to people, that I returned because it means there is something to return to. I hope it was the right decision.''</p>
