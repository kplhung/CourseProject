        <p>A FEW weeks ago, I walked into Al Forno in Providence, R.I., expecting a good meal. I got something else. I left the lean, cool evening air and stepped into the restaurant's foyer.</p>
        <p>It felt as if I had stepped into another world.</p>
        <p>The earthy aromas of burning wood, yeast, roasting chicken and herbs enveloped me. The restaurant smelled like food, and it stopped me. I could not think of a single New York restaurant that smelled so good. Or for that matter, one that smelled like anything at all.</p>
        <p>Over the last few decades, aroma, especially in better restaurants, has slowly disappeared. And now as more ambitious restaurants open by the minute, an aroma-free environment has become something of a norm. Powerful new ventilation systems in the kitchen are partly responsible. But more than anything else, it's because restaurateurs do not want the scents of food and cooking swirling around diners, even if they have an open kitchen.</p>
        <p>''Generally you don't want odors out in the dining room,'' said Tom Colicchio, the chef at Gramercy Tavern. ''When eating food and enjoying food, your olfactory senses play a big part,'' he said. ''If you start to smell other things, it gets in the way -- it detracts from the experience.''</p>
        <p>''Crispness'' is the word many restaurateurs and designers use to describe the kind of air they are after. And to get it, they avoid absorptive fabrics, opting for gauzy curtains rather than heavy, dense ones and hard-surfaced floors rather than rugs. Dining rooms use neutral-smelling chemicals for cleaning, often at night so any odors fade before the next service. A crisp room may not evoke home, but it can make all the flavors in a meal easier to comprehend, as each course announces its arrival to the diner's nose.</p>
        <p>Modern ventilation systems help that along too. Fan-driven kitchen exhausts have been around since the 1960's, but they have become increasingly efficient over the years. Now, the fans above the stoves are so forceful, they pull air from the dining room through the kitchen, actually creating a small amount of negative air pressure between the two. Peter Bentel, an owner of Bentel &amp; Bentel Architects/Planners in Locust Valley, N.Y., said that ''with appropriate engineering, putting smells back into the dining room is actually difficult.''</p>
        <p>Ventilation must be powerful enough to suck airborne grease, heat and cooking odors up ducts above the tenant spaces in the building, at which point it is released into the air. With a New York restaurant like Tabla, that means a 29-story climb. The velocity of the air in the duct must also be powerful enough to keep the grease airborne so that it does not stick to the duct and become a fire hazard. Ideally, said Dominick DePinto, an owner of Ambrosino, DePinto &amp; Schmieder Consulting Engineers, a Manhattan firm that has designed kitchen exhaust systems at the Royalton and Caroline's Comedy Club, that velocity should be 100 feet of air per minute.</p>
        <p>It's hardly the romantic image of the hearth. But it may be why the city itself has such a varied bouquet.</p>
        <p>Kitchen aromas have changed, too. Before modern ventilation came along, kitchens were hot, greasy, pungent dens. Jacques Pepin said that when he was a chef in the 1950's and 1960's, aromas distinguished parts of the kitchen. ''When you went through the different areas, you knew what people were cooking,'' he said. Cooking then employed all the senses. Cooks, he said, would tell a chicken was done by the way it sounded in the oven. When the fat clarified and it was nearly done, the sound of it roasting would change. It was said to sing. Today's sterile, lab-like kitchens, Mr. Pepin lamented, disassociate cooks from the food. Air conditioning cools kitchens off, and exhausts remove the smell of food.</p>
        <p>If you were to enter many dining rooms blindfolded, though, you would be more likely to guess that you were in a library or a florist shop. And sometimes this is intentional. Some restaurants go to great expense to import aromas.</p>
        <p>At Chanterelle, arrangements of flowers around the room are like oversize atomizers. With them, said Karen Waltuck, an owner, comes an airiness, and a cool, clean quality inside. ''It's almost a spa feeling,'' she said. ''It should make you relax but feel pampered.''</p>
        <p>At Gramercy Tavern, which was designed by Mr. Bentel's firm, the walls are coated with beeswax and there is a great deal of wood in the furnishings, all so that there would be a ''wholesome'' aroma. The intention, Mr. Bentel said, was to make diners feel as comfortable as they would in the home of a good friend.</p>
        <p>In the last five years the Monell Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia began studying more explicitly the relationship between odor and appetite. Fifteen years ago, Dr. Marcia Levin Pelchat, a sensory psychologist at the center, said, taste and smell were considered the minor senses. Today, scientists think that they may be much more powerful and have much more influence on mood and behavior.</p>
        <p>An aroma like beeswax, Ms. Levin Pelchat said, ''is associated with craft and nature, and it does smell a little bit like honey, so my guess would be that it would evoke an impression of naturalness, the outdoors, or memories of natural things.'' Flowers, she said, teeter between a good association, if it's mild enough, and a distraction, like heavy perfume. ''If they evoke the memory of a garden they can give the same feeling of freshness,'' she added.</p>
        <p>A controversial hypothesis, Ms. Levin Pelchat said, is that food aromas may cause a release of insulin into the bloodstream, resulting in a drop in blood sugar and possibly feelings of hunger. Some responses to food, like salivation, are biological. But reactions to most aromas are believed to be learned responses. ''You have to learn what is a food odor and what isn't, and you have to learn what odors have to do with Mom and which ones have to do with Grandmom,'' Ms. Levin Pelchat said.</p>
        <p>Aroma and memory are undeniably powerful. When I think of the months I spent in Paris, I do not so much remember images of the place I lived and the streets I walked. I recall the smells. There was the sharp winy odor of the cafe in the morning that I noticed from the street as I passed its open door. When I think of the bakery where I worked, I think of the yeast and butter, tile and apples, a confluence so distinct I can taste the pain au levain in my head and I can smell the cool street air that came in with the delivery man. Ask me the color of the tile, and my memory fails.</p>
        <p>When I returned from Providence, I began paying more attention to what restaurants smelled like. The most aromatic place I found was a street cart that offered chicken curry. The further up I went on the restaurant scale, the more aromas diminished. Small bistros tended to be heady blurs of herbs, meat and cigarette smoke. Some had more specific bouquets. A stop at Le Gigot in Greenwich Village one evening was like walking into a pool of caramelized onions. Woo Lae Oak in SoHo was a dense whiff of beef, vinegar and spices. Daniel smelled of fabric; and I could smell the gin in my drink.</p>
        <p>What formal restaurants want to avoid, Mr. Bentel said, are lingering aromas, which can cling to fabrics.  This is often controlled through design. In the banquet room at Eleven Madison Park, for instance, metallic curtains were chosen for a glass wall, so that aromas from one party would not linger to the next.</p>
        <p>And yet, chefs do not want to eliminate aroma from the experience entirely. A few years ago, chefs began serving soup at the table, ladling it into a warm bowl in front of the diner. It looked impressive, but it also allowed the aroma of the soup to blossom right under the diner's nose.</p>
        <p>Wylie Dufresne, the chef at 71 Clinton Fresh Food, once worked at a restaurant in Paris where the chef would put a sprig of dried thyme on a plate and light it on fire before it was sent out so that the aroma would fill the dining room. The dish was nothing more than roasted chicken with mashed potatoes, but, Mr. Dufresne said, the effect could be seen on diners' faces as they followed the waiter crossing the room like a tennis ball sailing across the court.</p>
        <p>Such control turns the experience of dining into a slow sequence of condensed sensual frames. The dining room at Peacock Alley, which is sunk deep in the core of the Waldorf Astoria, is like a secluded, aroma-free sanctuary. It is so neutral that when, on a recent visit, the waiter set down a piece of bread on the plate, I could smell the yeast in it. Subtlety has never seen such extremes. Every dish thereafter had the same kind of spotlighted entrance.</p>
        <p>I had a similar experience at Jean Georges, where the minimalist room is a perfect expression of that ''crispness.'' It makes a fine environment for focused wine tasting. And somehow eases the prospect of eating so many courses.</p>
        <p>But there is also something deadening and hollow about it. A restaurant that does not smell of food or cooking cannot spark and enliven all the senses the way a restaurant brimming with the aromas of a kitchen can.</p>
        <p>Peasant, a new restaurant in SoHo, has no electrical wiring in its kitchen. All the cooking is done on a wood stove and in a wood-fired oven in full view from the dining room. A ventilation duct is also directed into the dining room, piping in garlic and oil, new brick and young wood. The aromas echo from wall to wall. With the kitchen showered in natural light from a glass roof, the place has a soft blue glow and dark shadows. It could be cold and austere. But the aroma of food gives it warmth.</p>
        <p>Around the corner is Lombardi's, a 95-year-old pizza shop with coal-fired ovens. The aroma of the place is like worn leather, something that can't be fabricated. It always smells the same, always pleasant, of roasted tomatoes and sweet dough.</p>
        <p>Restaurants with powerful ventilation systems do not harbor such complex, aged blends. But many do still smell. And not always good. While most aromas are sucked out, some linger. At Beacon in Midtown, a wood-burning oven is the centerpiece of the kitchen. But wood is not what you smell. When you walk in the door, you first pass the bar. It smells like stale beer and a college dormitory. In the back, by the kitchen, there is the aroma of grease. At Blue Ribbon, a sushi restaurant in Greenwich Village, seaweed and old fish meet you before you even enter the place.</p>
        <p>The aroma of food, in most cases, is pleasurable. It is what seduces people as they cook. And for many people it is what spells home. When I arrive at my door in the hallway and smell the cooking of the woman who lives next to me, she doesn't know it, but it always makes me feel as if I am being welcomed home. Perhaps, as the Monell scientists suspect, it is all learned. But it took me until now to appreciate its importance.</p>
        <p>My dinner at Al Forno changed me. I can remember how the red wine we drank smelled of spice and berries. I can still taste the ricotta tart, redolent of almonds. I was not distracted by the other aromas. I was embraced by them. They gave the place soul and a deep, thrumming vitality.</p>
        <p>When I got home and took off my coat, I could still smell the wood and smoke. I couldn't think of a better reminder of the experience.</p>
