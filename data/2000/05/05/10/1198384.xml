        <p>The Jets may still have plans to acquire a high-profile, veteran free-agent wide receiver, like Cincinnati's Carl Pickens, but yesterday, they made the expected move, awarding Dedric Ward a new, one-year contract. The team also signed running back Leon Johnson and the special teams player Chris Hayes to one-year contracts. Cornerback Tony Scott, the Jets' sixth-round pick from North Carolina State, signed a two-year deal.</p>
        <p>Ward, entering his fourth year, was a restricted free agent with little negotiating leverage and had been tendered a $472,000 contract for next season by the Jets. During the recently concluded restricted free-agent signing period, Ward did not draw a significant offer from another team. His new deal with the Jets is also for $472,000, but includes incentives Ward can earn with a stellar season, and is keyed to the Jets' winning the majority of their games. People familiar with the contract said the Jets also suggested that they would consider giving Ward a long-term deal later this year if Ward's numbers improved dramatically during the 2000 season.</p>
        <p>Last season, Ward had 22 receptions for 325 yards and 3 touchdowns. He also returned 38 punts for an average of 7.6 yards. Ward, 25, has 63 career catches for 1,014 yards. For now, the Jets' starting receivers are Ward, who is 5 feet 9 inches and 180 pounds, and Wayne Chrebet, who is officially listed as being 5-10 and weighing 188 pounds. The team drafted wide receiver Laveranues Coles in the third round and used its fifth-round pick to draft another receiver, Windrell Hayes. Both had impressive rookie minicamps.</p>
        <p>Still, the Jets would appear to be in the market for Pickens, who is wearing out his welcome in Cincinnati, or possibly Andre Hastings, a free agent who last played in New Orleans. The question is whether the Jets can afford Pickens, whose price tag might be in the $3 million range.</p>
        <p>Johnson, 25, was another restricted free agent and he also received an incentive-laden contract.</p>
