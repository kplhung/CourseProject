        <p>Unsure how much more production they can get from a future Hall of Famer, the Mets have placed outfielder Rickey Henderson on major league waivers, baseball officials confirmed tonight.</p>

        <p>Unsure how much more production they can get from a future Hall of Famer, the Mets have placed outfielder Rickey Henderson on major league waivers, baseball officials confirmed tonight.</p>
        <p>Henderson has two days to pass through waivers, giving clubs -- in order from the National League team with the worst record to the one with the best, then the same way in the American League -- a chance to claim him and assume the remainder of his $2 million salary for this season. If a team claims Henderson, the Mets can decide to pull him back, and perhaps work out a trade with that club. Or, they can let him go to the other team for the $20,000 waiver price, and that team would pay his salary.</p>
        <p>A final option would be for the Mets simply to release Henderson. If they did, another team might scoop him up, because, under baseball rules, the Mets would then have to pay Henderson most of what he is owed for 2000.</p>
        <p>Henderson is 41, and Mets officials do not know whether he has reached the end of the line in a brilliant career. Henderson is a special talent, probably the best leadoff hitter in baseball history, but so far he has had a bad season without any period of extended success.</p>
        <p>The Mets discussed trade possibilities involving Henderson over the winter. Although he had a strong season in 1999, batting .315, stealing 37 bases and compiling a .423 on-base percentage, he also created distractions by not always hustling in the field or on the basepaths. There were also reports that he had spent the final part of the Mets' final game of the season -- an extra-inning loss to Atlanta in Game 6 of the National League Championship Series -- playing cards in the clubhouse with Bobby Bonilla.</p>
        <p>Whether all this made the Mets weary of Henderson even before this season began is unclear. Even at this point, with his slow start, they do not seem to have fully decided what to do with a player who has a chance to set the career record for walks and runs, and has a shot at 3,000 hits. The waiver procedure the Mets are using for Henderson is fairly common and does not necessarily indicate that they have had their fill of him; had the Mets put Henderson on irrevocable waivers, in which any team who claims a player immediately gets him, it would have been a clearer indication that the Mets want Henderson gone.</p>
        <p>''I don't anticipate releasing Rickey Henderson,'' General Manager Steve Phillips said.</p>
        <p>But the Mets are frustrated with Henderson's play. He has said he has had problems seeing the ball, a common affliction for players but one that rarely lasts this long, one Mets official said. After going 1 for 4 tonight in a 2-0 victory over the Pirates, Henderson is batting .207, and he had no hitting streak longer than two games, just one extra-base hit and only two stolen bases, a stunningly low number for the career leader in steals.</p>
        <p>Henderson was unhappy that the Mets did not renegotiate his contract this season and grumbled in spring training about the way he was double-switched out of games last season. He did not speak much to reporters from early April until last weekend, when he again questioned Manager Bobby Valentine's use of him.</p>
        <p>Phillips and Valentine spoke today with Henderson, who started in left field against the Pirates and led off, as usual. Their message, Henderson said, was this: ''Don't worry about it. It don't mean nothing.''</p>
        <p>For the Mets, Henderson's production on the field is more important than anything Henderson says. He has always said flamboyant things, and both Valentine and Phillips have given him a wide berth and refrained from criticizing him.</p>
        <p>''If Rickey's going to talk -- and he has talked during his career -- he's usually able to walk his talk,'' Valentine said. ''That ability is what separated him -- not what he has said, but what he's capable of doing. He's capable of playing better than he's played, and he'll do that.''</p>
        <p>Henderson came out early for batting practice today, something he said he was planning to do, and he got in 40 to 50 extra swings, concentrating on limiting movement of his head and ''tracking the ball'' better. He thinks he is finding his stroke, he said, and he is looking forward to warmer temperatures. He said he does not know his waiver status now -- ''I know I've been on it probably 1,000 times,'' he said -- and said he is not bothered by it, whatever it is.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes you get disappointed, but nothing in this game makes me mad or sad,'' he said. ''I'm here. I think we all -- players, managers, anybody -- we get frustrated when things aren't going the way we want them to go or expect them to go. But this game is about adjustments. That's what I've got to do.</p>
        <p>''If everything's going well, it would be no problem. When things go bad, it seems like we have a lot of controversy.''</p>
        <p>Baseball officials are fined if they comment on waivers, so Phillips did not confirm nor deny that he had asked waivers on Henderson. As for another team claiming Henderson, one baseball official said, it would have to be a big-market team that would be willing to gamble on an aging, slumping player.</p>
        <p>Without Henderson, the Mets would seem to have few options to replace him as their everyday leadoff hitter. While the speedy outfielder Jason Tyner, a first-round draft pick, is hitting .314 with 16 stolen bases at Class AAA Norfolk, Phillips said: ''We have a lot of minor leaguers with speed. I'm not sure any of them are ready for the major leagues.''</p>
        <p>Jon Nunnally has batted leadoff six times for the Mets this year, and Benny Agbayani and Melvin Mora have done so once apiece. Jay Payton, who has good speed, is another possible leadoff hitter.</p>
        <p>''If Rickey got hurt, I don't think we'd have any problem finding someone for the leadoff role,'' Valentine said. ''We wouldn't cancel the season.''</p>
