        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Outmanned, Outgunned in Sierra Leone'' (Op-Ed, May 9): Michael Maren is right to criticize the developed nations for their lack of real commitment to peacekeeping in Sierra Leone. While there are members of Congress and the administration who assert that we cannot be the world's policemen, they should take a longer view of what our strategic interests really are.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Outmanned, Outgunned in Sierra Leone'' (Op-Ed, May 9): Michael Maren is right to criticize the developed nations for their lack of real commitment to peacekeeping in Sierra Leone. While there are members of Congress and the administration who assert that we cannot be the world's policemen, they should take a longer view of what our strategic interests really are.</p>
        <p>Civil unrest anywhere is a drain on the global economy. If we truly believe in globalization, then we must take a pro-active role when there are threats to peace and stability. Otherwise, as in Sierra Leone, the victims will conclude that globalization is a one-way street and they are at the wrong end.</p>
        <p>It is time that we stopped training our military to fight cold war-style battles and began to train for the real threats we face today: regional civil unrest perpetrated by paramilitary forces, like that in the Balkans, Somalia and East Timor.</p>
