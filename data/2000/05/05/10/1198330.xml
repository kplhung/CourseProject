        <p>Editorial on belated Justice Department prober of charge that former CIA director John Deutch transferred highly classified data to insecure computers at his home in late 1996 holds affair shows CIA cannot adequately probe itself and that Atty Gen Janet Reno fails to enforce law against top Clinton administration officials</p>

        <p>If the director of central intelligence transfers highly classified materials to insecure computers at his home, he may well be violating the law, and his conduct requires an immediate and full investigation. But when faced with just such actions by John Deutch in late 1996, the C.I.A. and the Justice Department badly fumbled the case. They are now scrambling to make amends, with Justice belatedly initiating a criminal investigation. But the affair once again demonstrates that the agency cannot adequately investigate itself and that Attorney General Janet Reno has consistently failed to enforce the law against top Clinton administration officials.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deutch was a demanding and effective leader of the C.I.A. who did much in his short tenure to address the agency's past abuses and reform its practices. But enlightened leadership does not provide immunity from the law, and Mr. Deutch's carelessness cried out for a rigorous investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation under the direction of a seasoned prosecutor.</p>

        <p>If the director of central intelligence transfers highly classified materials to insecure computers at his home, he may well be violating the law, and his conduct requires an immediate and full investigation. But when faced with just such actions by John Deutch in late 1996, the C.I.A. and the Justice Department badly fumbled the case. They are now scrambling to make amends, with Justice belatedly initiating a criminal investigation. But the affair once again demonstrates that the agency cannot adequately investigate itself and that Attorney General Janet Reno has consistently failed to enforce the law against top Clinton administration officials.</p>
        <p>Mr. Deutch was a demanding and effective leader of the C.I.A. who did much in his short tenure to address the agency's past abuses and reform its practices. But enlightened leadership does not provide immunity from the law, and Mr. Deutch's carelessness cried out for a rigorous investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation under the direction of a seasoned prosecutor.</p>
        <p>Instead, it received cursory examination by the C.I.A. and no investigation by the F.B.I. Historically, the C.I.A. has put more energy into covering up mistakes and misconduct than investigating them. Ironically, Mr. Deutch worked hard to change that culture. But when his own behavior became an issue in December 1996 as he was preparing to return to private life, some of the very aides he had recruited to help reform the C.I.A. may have tried to protect him. Nora Slatkin, who served as executive director, and Michael O'Neil, who was the agency's general counsel, failed to insist on a thorough investigation and may have tried to impede examination of the case. Both deny doing so, but their conduct was sharply criticized by the agency's inspector general and a White House intelligence board.</p>
        <p>The C.I.A. security staff, which never bothered to interview Mr. Deutch, wrote an anemic report in 1997. By the time the agency got around to notifying the Justice Department, the one-year time limit for appointing an independent counsel had expired. In April 1999 Ms. Reno inexplicably decided not to pursue the matter, without ordering an F.B.I. investigation. George Tenet, Mr. Deutch's deputy and successor, removed his security clearances in 1999.</p>
        <p>It seems clear that Mr. Deutch received special treatment because he was a top official, and that Ms. Reno gave him the benefit of the doubt, just as she has done for others in the administration. For an experienced prosecutor, she has an uncanny instinct for ignoring or misreading the evidence and the law when top officials are credibly accused of misconduct. Before the books are closed on this case, the actions of Mr. Deutch and his former colleagues must be carefully examined. If the evidence warrants prosecution, the high positions they held should be no barrier.</p>
