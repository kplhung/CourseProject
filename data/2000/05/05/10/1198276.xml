        <p>Closings on 32nd Street</p>
        <p>Larry Forgione will close the Coach House, in the Avalon hotel on East 32nd Street, at the end of May. He said he had been counting on banquet rooms in the hotel, which are not yet finished. He is also closing Rosehill, on the former site of An American Place, which he moved to Lexington Avenue and 50th Street.</p>
        <p>New Faces in Harlem</p>
        <p>A taste of New Orleans has come to Harlem with the opening of Bayou, at 308 Lenox Avenue (125th Street). The second-floor space has a bistro feeling with a big central bar. The chef, Steven Manning, formerly of Clancy's in New Orleans, is preparing classics like shrimp remoulade, crawfish etouffee and po' boy sandwiches. The owner, Michael Eberstadt, also owns the Slice of Harlem pizzeria on the first floor.</p>
        <p>This summer, Jimmy's Uptown is to open at 130th Street and Adam Clayton Powell Jr. Boulevard with Gavin Citron, formerly the chef at Celadon on the Upper East Side, in the kitchen. The owner is Jimmy Rodriguez, who also owns Jimmy's Bronx Cafe near Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>Bistro Style Downtown</p>
        <p>Village has replaced Bondini at 62 West Ninth Street. The double-height dining room's huge oval skylight has been restored. A co-owner, Stephen Lyle, formerly the chef at the Independent, prepares American food, but dishes like veal ravioli and grilled Louisiana shrimp have a bistro spin to suit the setting.</p>
