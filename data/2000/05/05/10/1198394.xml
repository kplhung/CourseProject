        <p>Three advertisers have named agencies to handle accounts.</p>
        <p>Pfizer Inc. in New York named Deutsch Inc. in New York as the first agency to create ads aimed at consumers for Zoloft, an antidepressant, nine months after Deutsch was named to create campaigns aimed at consumers for another Pfizer drug, Zyrtec, an antihistamine.

        <p>Three advertisers have named agencies to handle accounts.</p>
        <p>Pfizer Inc. in New York named Deutsch Inc. in New York as the first agency to create ads aimed at consumers for Zoloft, an antidepressant, nine months after Deutsch was named to create campaigns aimed at consumers for another Pfizer drug, Zyrtec, an antihistamine. Billings for the Zoloft assignment were estimated at $50 million.</p>
        <p>The decision came after a review that had been narrowed to Deutsch and finalists that included FCB Worldwide in New York, part of True North Communications; Merkley Newman Harty Healthworks in New York, part of the Omnicom Group; and Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising in New York. Media duties for Zoloft are at Carat North America in New York, part of the Aegis Group.</p>
        <p>Kraft Foods in Northfield, Ill., part of the Philip Morris Companies, named Y.&amp; R. Advertising in New York to handle the accounts of a company Kraft recently acquired, Balance Bar. Billings were estimated at $30 million.</p>
        <p>The accounts are for food products sold under the Balance Bar and Jenny Craig brand names. They had been handled by Suissa Miller in Los Angeles until the company was acquired by Kraft. The decision came after a review involving Y.&amp; R. Advertising and another agency that works for Kraft, Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide in New York, part of the WPP Group. The Interpublic Group of Companies owns a stake in Suissa Miller, which is not on the Kraft agency roster.</p>
        <p>And Denny's, part of the Advantica Restaurant Group, named West Wayne in Tampa, Fla., to handle its general market account, with billings estimated at less than $10 million.</p>
        <p>Debbie Atkins, a spokeswoman for Denny's in Spartanburg, S.C., said the decision came after a review that had been narrowed to West Wayne and the Kaplan Thaler Group in New York, part of the B Com3  Group. The task of creating general market campaigns for Denny's had been handled for five years by Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners in New York, part of the Lowe Group unit of Interpublic; Denny's and Lowe Lintas parted ways in January.</p>
