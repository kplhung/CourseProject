        <p>Marcus Camby walked into the nearly empty Knicks locker room tonight looking more like a battered heavyweight boxer than a backup center. His right eye was almost swollen shut as he sat down and tilted back his head to receive more eye solution from the trainer Ron Culp.</p>

        <p>Marcus Camby walked into the nearly empty Knicks locker room tonight looking more like a battered heavyweight boxer than a backup center. His right eye was almost swollen shut as he sat down and tilted back his head to receive more eye solution from the trainer Ron Culp.</p>
        <p>''Can I get a tissue or something?'' Camby asked as the drops rolled down his cheek.</p>
        <p>Knicks fans who were crying for more Camby minutes against the Miami Heat are now faced with the prospect of him playing less, although he declared he would be ready for Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals on Friday night in New York.</p>
        <p>Camby caught an elbow to his eye from Otis Thorpe under the Heat basket and was forced to the bench with 8 minutes 32 seconds left in the Knicks' 82-76 victory over the Heat, which tied the four-of-seven-game series at a game apiece. Early in the second quarter, Camby banged his elbow when he fell after swooping to reject a shot by Alonzo Mourning.</p>
        <p>''He was injured and came up big when we needed him,'' Charlie Ward said. ''That's part of it. We need Marcus and those guys to give us energy. That's something we need to get more of from our starters.''</p>
        <p>Between injuries, Camby's play and hustle punctuated how the Knicks' bench helped steal the home-court advantage in the series.</p>
        <p>''It was a rough game,'' Camby said. ''But I will be ready to go. No doubt about that.''</p>
        <p>Camby played 21 minutes, scored 10 points and grabbed 7 rebounds, He was especially effective in the first half, getting 6 points and 5 rebounds in 14 minutes.</p>
        <p>''I'm all right,'' Camby said. ''I wanted to play and go back out there. I didn't want to leave the ballgame when I played like that. Definitely, getting your eye busted up, you don't want to leave like that. But Jeff went with his rotation down the stretch.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks' reserves were faced with plenty to accomplish, what with Latrell Sprewell (2 of 13), Allan Houston (3 of 14) and Patrick Ewing (4 of 12) misfiring. The story of the bench was capped by Chris Childs, who drilled his only shot of the game, a 3-pointer from the top of the key with 8:25 left that gave the Knicks a seemingly comfortable 68-54 lead.</p>
        <p>Camby and Kurt Thomas provided an important spark in the first half, somehow helping turn an awful shooting performance into a 38-34 halftime lead. The Knicks shot 28.2 percent in the first half, with four starters each making only one basket. Sprewell and Houston led the flameout, missing 8 of 9 attempts each. Ewing (1 of 6) and Larry Johnson (1 of 3), added to the futility, leaving the Knicks vulnerable early.</p>
        <p>Ward, who finished with 13 points, was the catalyst, making 3 of his first 4 shots and providing the kind of leadership that the Heat expect from Tim Hardaway. Ward also grabbed 6 rebounds, including one with under two minutes to play after the Heat had pulled within 7 points.</p>
        <p>Thomas hit the American Airlines Arena court as hard as Camby did. Slammed to the floor on a flagrant foul by Otis Thorpe, Thomas picked himself up and scored all 6 of his points in a key 10-0 run that lifted the Knicks to a 22-13 lead late in the first quarter.</p>
