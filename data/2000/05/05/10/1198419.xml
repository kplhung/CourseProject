        <p>The names have changed on both sides, but the negotiations between NBC and the stars of its top comedy show are definitely moving into Yogi Berra territory: deja vu all over again.</p>
        <p>The network has less than a week to set its fall prime-time schedule, and every prospective list of shows being drawn up this week includes one Thursday night headed by ''Friends'' and another in which that sitcom has gone away.</p>
        <p>That's exactly what NBC was forced to do four Mays ago, when three co-stars of ''Seinfeld'' were holding out for $1 million an episode. Now it's the six stars of ''Friends'' who are asking for that price. The studio making the show is also the same, Warner Brothers, though every program executive from both the network and studio has changed.</p>
        <p>One other factor is the same: NBC knows that even if it does not conclude a successful negotiation with the stars, ''Friends'' will not be going to another network. That was the case with ''Seinfeld'' too, because the network had a deal with Jerry Seinfeld. In this case the network already has a deal with Warner Brothers that ensures that no other network can buy the show out from under NBC.</p>
        <p>So is there a real risk that ''Friends'' will not be back next season? Few of those involved in the negotiations seem to think to. As one senior executive put it, ''Nobody's walking around in a panic over this.''</p>
        <p>Everyone agrees this is all about money, and money does not usually kill deals when all sides have a vested interest in a show's continuing. ''Friends,'' if not quite a ''Seinfeld,'' remains the strongest comedy on network television, both in terms of ratings and critical appraisal.</p>
        <p>NBC, which had seen its ratings slide this season, clearly needs the show. And Warner Brothers, which would share the salary costs, wants more episodes because it is making a fortune on syndication. But perhaps neither network nor studio is desperate enough to pay each of the six principal cast members $1 million an episode.</p>
        <p>NBC and Warner Brothers have reportedly pushed their offer into the range of $600,000 each (the figure that the three ''Seinfeld'' co-stars ultimately accepted). The ''Friends'' actors, using the leverage they know they have as the deadline of a new season schedule draws near, are sticking to $1 million.</p>
        <p>The justification for the stars -- Lisa Kudrow, Courteney Cox-Arquette, Jennifer Aniston, David Schwimmer, Matthew Perry and Matt LeBlanc -- is that NBC was willing to play $1 million an episode two season ago for the stars of ''Mad About You,'' perhaps the biggest overpayment in television history. That series had one disastrous season left.</p>
        <p>Far from making NBC more willing to pay however, the ''Mad About You'' deal has left it gun-shy about paying so much. NBC would much rather cite the ''Seinfeld'' precedent: the stars took the $600,000 an episode, and the show had one more year of huge ratings.</p>
        <p>In the case of ''Seinfeld,'' there was some genuine concern from NBC that a deal might collapse. But in this case the studio and network seem convinced that the stars, who have not exactly lit up Hollywood with their film work, cannot possibly turn down more than $16 million each for a season's work.</p>
        <p>One senior executive predicted that the figure would reach $700,000 each (that translates to a total of $16.8 million for each actor for a 24-episode season) and that a deal would be reached, possibly by Friday. NBC officially presents its schedule to advertisers in New York on Monday.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the situation is less clear for that other hit show held up in negotiations with its star, Fox's ''X-Files.'' David Duchovny is not holding out simply for money, but he has made clear that he is less than thrilled about continuing with the show.</p>
        <p>Mr. Duchovny also has a lawsuit over payment for reruns pending against Fox, which complicates any deal. Fox is in the same position as NBC in trying to plan a new schedule without knowing what to put in on Sunday nights at 9.</p>
        <p>The outcome is truly uncertain. The show's other star, Gillain Anderson, is signed for another year. Mr. Duchovny may opt to work only a partial season.</p>
        <p>The most likely outcome now: ''The X-Files'' will be back but not for a full season. Ms. Anderson's character, Scully, may have a different partner for much of the season.</p>
