        <p>Before ''The Gipper'' and the Oval Office, Ronald Reagan washed dishes in a women's dormitory at the small college here.</p>
        <p>In 1928, the 17-year-old future president followed the pastor's daughter, on whom he had had a crush, from his childhood home in Dixon, Ill., to Eureka College, situated amid the cornfields of central Illinois.</p>
        <p>Amid the Depression, Mr. Reagan spent four of the best years of his life at Eureka, according to local legend and his daughter Maureen Reagan.</p>
        <p>Today, thousands gathered on this  campus of 500 students to dedicate a new garden commemorating a visit Mr. Reagan made here in 1982, when  he proposed that the United States and the Soviet Union begin reducing their nuclear warheads.</p>
        <p>The Ronald Reagan Peace Garden, which commemorates the end of the cold war, contains a bronze bust of the former president and a 5-by-4-foot piece of the Berlin Wall. The garden is planted with tall white tulips called Maureen tulips, chosen to honor the former president's daughter, who has become his representative here in the six years since he was found to have Alzheimer's disease.</p>
        <p>''This school was the first love of his life,'' Ms. Reagan said recently as she walked across the campus.</p>
        <p>In the years after his graduation in 1932, Mr. Reagan, first as a movie star, then as California governor, and finally as president, visited the campus 14 times.</p>
        <p>By making the disarmament proposal as part of a commencement speech here in 1982, ''he gave them a presidential legacy,'' Ms. Reagan said. ''It was a gift only a president could give.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Reagan is said to have modeled the speech, which many say marked the beginning of the end of the cold war, after the ''Iron Curtain'' speech Winston Churchill gave in 1946 at Westminster College in Fulton, Mo.</p>
        <p>But critics like Frances FitzGerald, author of the recent book ''Way Out There in the Blue: Reagan, Star Wars and the End of the Cold War,'' discount the importance of the Eureka speech, saying that Mr. Reagan was basically forced into the strategic arms reduction talks by antinuclear activists.</p>
        <p>''But it was a wonderful speech,'' Ms. FitzGerald said.</p>
        <p>Still, it would seem almost impossible to tarnish Mr. Reagan's image at Eureka College, 16 miles east of Peoria, where his presence is felt not just in the Ronald Reagan Museum, replete with mementos like his college diploma or in the imposing Ronald and Neil Reagan Physical Education Center (named for Mr. Reagan and his older brother, who also attended the college).</p>
        <p>Indeed, one senses Mr. Reagan's stamp on the student body, from the buzzing chapter of the Young Republicans club to the well-groomed students in button-down shirts and ties. The former president finds his way into the curriculum, as well; recently, students on a college-sponsored trip to Ireland visited Mr. Reagan's ancestral home in County Tipperary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reagan's name also brings in healthy endowments; 20 students are Ronald Reagan Fellows, who attend Eureka on four-year scholarships and participate in all-expenses-paid internships all over the world.</p>
        <p>Students mentioned Mr. Reagan's reputation as a campus rebel; in his freshman year, he gave a rousing speech on curriculum that led to the resignation of Eureka's president.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people feel that it was here he first discovered his political voice,'' said Dr. Junius Rodriguez, an associate professor of history.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reagan said she could understand her father's affinity for the college.</p>
        <p>''I feel just like dear old Dad,'' she said. ''I don't ever want to leave.''</p>
