        <p>After a night of looting, the abandoned house of the notorious rebel leader Foday Sankoh had been stripped of almost everything this morning. Looters had left gaping holes in the brick walls where air-conditioners had kept out West Africa's stifling heat, and they had absconded with every piece of furniture, clothes and item of value.</p>
        <p>Outside the house, seven bodies, most of them Mr. Sankoh's guards, lay stiff. Inside, the looters left behind only some garbage and scraps of paper.</p>
        <p>Among them were pages from an original copy of the 10-month-old peace accord and an original copy of a document in which Sierra Leone's president granted Mr. Sankoh -- the man responsible for a terror campaign that left thousands of men, women and children killed or maimed -- ''absolute and free pardon.'' That allowed him to live, join a power-sharing government, form his political party and, eventually, run for president.</p>
        <p>At least that is how the peace process was supposed to go.</p>
        <p>Instead, Foday Sankoh, the legendary survivor, a jungle fighter with barely a primary school education, a failed commercial photographer, a cashiered corporal of Sierra Leone's army, has succeeded in turning his small country into a big problem for the world, and a policy quagmire for the West. [News analysis, Page A10.]</p>
        <p>Mr. Sankoh has humiliated the United Nations. He has embarrassed the West, including the Clinton administration.</p>
        <p>And now, after a confrontation outside his house on Monday, in which his bodyguards killed at least four civilians while 75 United Nations peacekeepers watched helplessly, he  has disappeared.</p>
        <p>Has he vanished into the bush? Did a rival militia kidnap him? Was he even alive? The United Nations force said it did not have him, and did not know his whereabouts. In the confusion on Monday, United Nations peacekeepers fled from the compound and apparently did not return in time to see what happened to Mr. Sankoh.</p>
        <p>''We are anxious to find a way of contacting Mr. Sankoh for reasons that I think are clear to all,'' David Wimhurst, the spokesman for the United Nations force, said at a news conference.</p>
        <p>The reasons related to the fact that 498 United Nations soldiers and civilians are being held hostage by Mr. Sankoh's men.</p>
        <p>In the confusion, the United Nations is trying to sort out what it can do to restore order. Thousands of fresh troops from Jordan, India and Bangladesh are expected to arrive sooner than originally planned to operate under the United Nations flag. In addition, Washington has sent a military team to Nigeria so that two Nigerian battalions can be deployed here as a West African force.</p>
        <p>That came a mere week after the Nigerians left Sierra Leone and Mr. Sankoh seized on their departure to attack the United Nations force.</p>
        <p>The streets of Freetown remained tense today as British paratroopers evacuated hundreds of Europeans. The paratroopers, who arrived on Monday, were not expected to take part in the United Nations force, though many could be seen today operating checkpoints and patrolling near the United Nations headquarters.</p>
        <p>Outside the capital, Nigerian and Guinean soldiers for the United Nations abandoned the junction town of Masiaka, about 35 miles east of here, after they ran out of ammunition, Mr. Wimhurst said. Mr. Sankoh's loyalists were thought to be advancing toward Freetown. Kamajors, traditional hunters who have been allied with the government, as well as supporters of a military junta that briefly controlled Sierra Leone in 1997, could be seen heading east out of the capital.</p>
        <p>As the United Nations force began losing its grip on the country in recent days, the country's main militias re-emerged, creating again the sense of lawlessness and anarchy that long pervaded Sierra Leone. New alliances appear to have formed, most significantly between the government and the 1997 junta, which was allied with Mr. Sankoh until last year.</p>
        <p>The 1997 junta is headed by Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma, who, like Mr. Sankoh, was a member of this power-sharing government. Most residents of Freetown, particularly those living around Mr. Sankoh's abandoned house, seem convinced that Colonel Koroma had captured Mr. Sankoh.</p>
        <p>Inside Colonel Koroma's house this morning and afternoon -- where young men in sweatsuits carried automatic rifles and walked up and down a staircase above which hung a sign that read ''Peace'' -- men talked of waiting for arms supplies from the government so they could go fight Mr. Sankoh.</p>
        <p>Colonel Koroma was too busy to talk, his aides said. But his personal bodyguard, known as Hiroshima Bomb, who wore a skirt and a tank top over chest muscles of steel, and a necklace of ammunition rounds, explained the new alliance.</p>
        <p>''We fight the R.U.F.,'' the bodyguard said of Mr. Sankoh's organization. And of the government that he had tried to topple only last year, he now said, ''It's my father, my brother.''</p>
        <p>What happens next to Sierra Leone will depend in great part on whether Mr. Sankoh is alive or dead.</p>
        <p>Outside Mr. Sankoh's ruined house today, a local man, Michael Kamara, 50, said Mr. Sankoh's involvement was essential to resolving the nine-year civil war.</p>
        <p>''He needs to express himself to the people,'' Mr. Kamara said. But what if he is dead? ''Peace will take its course,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Power and wealth to the people,'' read a poster in front of Mr. Sankoh's destroyed house.</p>
        <p>It was with that message that Mr. Sankoh began a civil war from the bush in 1991. The message struck a chord. Sierra Leone, rich with diamonds, had long been controlled by a corrupt elite made up of Lebanese businessmen and urban Sierra Leoneans. Many of those Sierra Leoneans were descendants of the freed slaves who gave the capital its name and formed a privileged class.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sankoh represented the rural dispossessed.</p>
        <p>Over time, Mr. Sankoh, who is in his 60's, seemed driven by ambition for power. His ally, Charles Taylor, a guerrilla fighter who terrorized Liberia into making him its president, provided the overall strategy: single out civilians and make their suffering so great that they will make you president just to stop the suffering.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Mr. Sankoh's group began committing the atrocities that defined this war: chopping off people's hands and arms. Belgian colonialists had done that decades ago to rule their colony in Central Africa, the Congo. But Mr. Sankoh infused the strategy with a contemporary significance: his men cut people's hands off because they had used them to vote in 1997 for the current president, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah.</p>
        <p>No hand, no more vote, his men said, as they chopped off limbs with machetes and axes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sankoh clearly did not believe in elections, preferring the military option.</p>
        <p>Since the peace accord was signed in July, he has delayed laying down his weapons and has obstructed peacekeepers from deploying, especially in the diamond district, where his men have kept digging. Now it is believed that they are better financed and equipped.</p>
        <p>Inside Mr. Sankoh's gutted house, in a second-floor room designated ''confidential office'' and marked ''out of bounds to all,'' motivational messages decorated the walls.</p>
        <p>''There are three kinds of people,'' one read. ''Those who make things happen. Those who watch things happen. Those who wonder what happened.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sankoh, if he is alive, certainly sees himself in the first category, and has gambled that the international community will fall into one of the other two.</p>
