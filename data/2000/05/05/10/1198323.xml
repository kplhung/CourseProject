        <p>Survey by Greenfield Online, Internet market research company, shows Microsoft.com has highest 'brand power,' defined as combination of rankings in three categories: brand familiarity, brand's ability to affect Internet landscape and brand's perceived financial strength; following Microsoft.com in survey are four well-known dot-coms: Amazon.com, Netscape.com, AOL.com and eBay.com (Advertising column) (M)</p>

        <p>MUCH has been made of the need for dot-coms to generate awareness of their names among computer users.

        <p>The study, which was conducted in October and released in mid-April by  Greenfield Online, an Internet market research company based in Wilton, Conn., surveyed about 3,400 computer users.

        <p>MUCH has been made of the need for dot-coms to generate awareness of their names among computer users. Internet companies are spending billions of dollars online, in print and on television to establish their brands. Now comes a study that tries to identify the winners and losers in the big branding struggle.</p>
        <p>The study, which was conducted in October and released in mid-April by  Greenfield Online, an Internet market research company based in Wilton, Conn., surveyed about 3,400 computer users. Among 100 Internet names placed before the respondents, Microsoft.com has the highest ''brand power,'' defined as a combination of rankings in three categories: brand familiarity, the brand's ability to affect the Internet landscape and the brand's perceived financial strength.</p>
        <p>Following Microsoft.com in the survey were four well-known dot-coms. In descending order, they were: Amazon.com, Netscape.com, AOL.com and eBay.com.</p>
        <p>''In terms of branding efforts, it's important to know if a site is having a personal effect on an Internet user,'' said Mara Shelby, vice president for client development at Greenfield, adding that sites perceived by computer users as being fun and frequently updated are more likely to be visited regularly.</p>
        <p>The idea, as Ms. Shelby puts it, is to ''keep people coming back for more.''</p>
        <p>The brands ranked No. 6 through 10 on the survey were more of a mixture of old and new: IBM.com; Barnesandnoble.com; MSN.com, the Microsoft Network; MSNBC.com; and Hotmail.com.</p>
        <p>Despite the high overall brand-power rankings for Internet-based companies, in the category of financial strength, the survey respondents said they were more likely to invest in traditional companies that have Web sites or sell products online than in pure dot-coms.</p>
        <p>The question the survey asked was, ''Assuming you had the money to invest and are currently investing, how likely would you be to invest in each brand at any time, for any reason?'' The only Internet-based company to rank in the top five was Amazon.com; the top five were: Microsoft.com, Amazon.com, IBM.com, WalMart.com, Intel.com and Coke.com. (Intel.com and Coke.com tied for fifth.)</p>
        <p>''I would have expected more offbeat dot-coms would be up there,'' Ms. Shelby said. Internet-based brands fared better in the other two categories in the survey. In fact, the same five companies that topped the overall brand-power rankings were also deemed the most powerful in  familiarity and ability to affect the Internet environment.</p>
        <p>The top five in familiarity were: Amazon.com, Microsoft.com, AOL.com, Netscape.com and eBay.com. The top five in the other category were: Microsoft.com, Netscape.com, AOL.com, Amazon.com and eBay.com.</p>
        <p>Greenfield sorted the data to prepare rankings of brands that compete against each other in fields like books, credit cards and fast food.</p>
        <p>For example, among online booksellers, the Amazon.com brand ranked highest, followed by Barnesandnoble.com and Borders.com.</p>
        <p>For credit card brands, survey respondents listed Visa.com first, then Mastercard.com and AmericanExpress.com. In fast food, McDonalds.com beat out Wendys.com, which led BurgerKing.com.</p>
        <p>Tying for the lowest ranking of the 100 brands were Haggle.com, an online auction site, and Hillspet.com, which offers nutritional advice and products for dogs and cats. The rest of the finishers on the bottom were: Petopia.com; Virgin.com; Wingspanbank.com; Sixdegrees.com; Furniture.com; Peapod.com; Fatbrain.com; and PG.com, the Web site of Procter &amp; Gamble.</p>
        <p>''It's not enough to just be well known,'' said Mike Mulligan, chairman and chief executive at Mapquest.com in New York, the Web site that ranked 20th for overall brand power. ''It's also important to have a brand that's readily understandable.</p>
        <p>''To a large extent,'' he added, ''your Web site is your brand.''</p>
