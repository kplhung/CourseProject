        <p>W. may have gone too far this time.</p>
        <p>Americans can forgive him not knowing that Gen. Pervez Musharraf seized power in Pakistan.</p>
        <p>But can we forgive him not knowing that Sarah Jessica Parker quaffs Cosmopolitans in Manhattan?</p>
        <p>So he thinks the Taliban is a rock band. We can live with that. But he's never heard of ''Sex and the City''?</p>
        <p>Now there's an ominous lacuna. Americans actually care about TV.</p>
        <p>A reporter for Glamour magazine, David France, interviewed Governor Bush on ''women's issues'' by playing a game of ''verbal Rorschach'':  ''I was rattling off names and concepts, and he was telling me the first thought that came to his mind.'' (W. still likes to live dangerously.)</p>
        <p>Mr. France said ''Phyllis Schlafly.'' Mr. Bush replied, ''Icon of the conservative right.'' Mr. France said ''Madonna.'' Mr. Bush replied, ''I'm not into pop music.'' Mr. France said ''Gloria Steinem.'' Mr. Bush replied, ''Uh, pioneer.''</p>
        <p>Mr. France said ''Sex and the City.'' Mr. Bush's face ''blistered in a purple fury,'' and his eyes narrowed and glowered. The candidate clearly thought he was being challenged on his claim of monogamy or support of teenage abstinence.</p>
        <p>Gordon Johndroe, Mr. Bush's press aide, tried to clear up the confusion. ''Governor,'' he said, ''it's an HBO television show.''</p>
        <p>''We've been on the campaign trail,'' Mr. Johndroe told Mr. France apologetically.</p>
        <p>But even when the governor is home, he told me in an interview last October, he doesn't go out to the movies or watch much TV -- except sports. He doesn't ordinarily look at political talk shows or late-night comics or network series or TV movies, or even zap around with his ''flicker,'' as he calls it, to get a feel for what the country's talking about.</p>
        <p>He may be the only Regis virgin left in America.</p>
        <p>''Culturally adrift,'' he cheerfully confessed.</p>
        <p>Those who are brainy about global issues are often not up on pop culture. And those who know about the Wu-Tang Clan may not know the intricacies of the World Trade Organization. But it's rare to get someone who has zero curiosity about either the big picture or the little picture.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has Condi Rice and a raft of coaches to prop him up on foreign affairs. But, as Broderick Crawford said of Judy Holliday's Billie Dawn in ''Born Yesterday,'' who's going to buy the kid some culture?</p>
        <p>It's easy to imagine how further free-associating on prime time could get the guy in all sorts of trouble.</p>
        <p>''West Wing''?</p>
        <p>''Next stop.''</p>
        <p>''Law and Order''?</p>
        <p>''Can't get enough of it.''</p>
        <p>''The Simpsons''?</p>
        <p>''Alan and Ann are good folks.''</p>
        <p>''Mad About You''?</p>
        <p>''Hope all the women voters are.''</p>
        <p>''NYPD Blue''?</p>
        <p>''That's Rudy's problem.''</p>
        <p>''La Femme Nikita''?</p>
        <p>''That's Putin's problem.''</p>
        <p>''Sports Night''?</p>
        <p>''Every night.''</p>
        <p>''Walker, Texas Ranger''?</p>
        <p>''Made money. Sold the team.''</p>
        <p>''Boy Meets World''?</p>
        <p>''That's my story.''</p>
        <p>''Whose Line Is It Anyway?''</p>
        <p>''I won't play gotcha with drug questions.''</p>
        <p>''Queen Latifah''?</p>
        <p>''Ethiopia?''</p>
        <p>''The Pretender''?</p>
        <p>''It was a tough primary, but I've always respected John.''</p>
        <p>''Friends''?</p>
        <p>''I listened and he listened. And now we've got a good relationship.''</p>
        <p>''When Animals Attack''?</p>
        <p>''I'm glad Pat Buchanan left the party.''</p>
        <p>''Ladies Man''?</p>
        <p>''He's leaving. I'll restore honor to the Oval Office.''</p>
        <p>''Politically Incorrect''?</p>
        <p>''President Gore.''</p>
        <p>''Access Hollywood''?</p>
        <p>''That's Democratic money.''</p>
        <p>''Buffy''?</p>
        <p>''Uncle Bucky's wife.''</p>
        <p>''King of Queens''?</p>
        <p>''I'm a better person for meeting with those Log Cabin Republicans.''</p>
        <p>''Just Shoot Me''?</p>
        <p>''Your questions weren't so bad. A little on the couch.''</p>
        <p>''Charmed''?</p>
        <p>''Same here.''</p>
