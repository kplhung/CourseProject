        <p>I was raised by a mother who believed you should change professions every 10 years or so, just to keep things interesting. True to that philosophy, she started out as a teacher, then became a psychologist, a lawyer and an international business consultant. Now a grandmother of five, she still wonders what she'll be when she grows up.</p>
        <p>It seems my mother was ahead of her time. Today the workplace is full of people bouncing not only from job to job, but from one profession to the next, just for the sheer joy of the change. My neighbor's landscaper used to sell scientific laboratory equipment. My son's teacher used to be in advertising. A rabbi I know has become a television executive. Even my father, who spent 40 linear years as an orthodontist, recently founded his own travel business.</p>

        <p>I was raised by a mother who believed you should change professions every 10 years or so, just to keep things interesting. True to that philosophy, she started out as a teacher, then became a psychologist, a lawyer and an international business consultant. Now a grandmother of five, she still wonders what she'll be when she grows up.</p>
        <p>It seems my mother was ahead of her time. Today the workplace is full of people bouncing not only from job to job, but from one profession to the next, just for the sheer joy of the change. My neighbor's landscaper used to sell scientific laboratory equipment. My son's teacher used to be in advertising. A rabbi I know has become a television executive. Even my father, who spent 40 linear years as an orthodontist, recently founded his own travel business.</p>
        <p>To ask people why they switched is to chart the national economy. Once upon a time, people started fresh because they had lost their jobs. Larry Gardner, for one, had been a medical illustrator for nearly 30 years, drawing graphics, by hand, for N.A.S.A. and the Navy until a decade ago. Then computers made that line of work obsolete. His longtime hobby was competing in muzzleloading rifle matches, where participants dress in period costume (think Daniel Boone or Davy Crockett) and shoot reproduction firearms. So Mr. Gardner made a business out of that hobby, creating ornately carved rifles with silver inlays and selling them, through ads in Muzzle Blasts magazine, for $2,500 to $5,000 apiece.</p>
        <p>Today Muzzle Blasts magazine has a Web site, and the computers that closed a door to Mr. Gardner have opened the world to anyone with a modem and a dream. Yes, people still lose jobs. But jobs are just as likely to lose them. Al Amaloo spent 17 years processing blood tests in the lab of an Indiana hospital. Every night he would go home and play video games. An addict from the days of Pong and Pac-Man, when the Atari 2600 was considered cutting-edge technology, Mr. Amaloo created GameWinners .com, a site that discloses the secrets of hundreds of games, four years ago. Last year he added banner ads. That, combined with his slot at About.com, the network of experts on a variety of subjects, earns him more than $200,000 a year. ''I quit my hospital job,'' he said, ''when I realized I was making more than the doctors.''</p>
        <p>John Drummond also had a ''real'' job -- 23 years at a computer manufacturer. As a child he had delivered newspapers on a unicycle, but he had given that up ''the day I got my driver's license'' and, 25 years later, he had put on 25 pounds. Two years ago, at 41, he got back on the cycle (don't you dare call it a ''bike'' when he's around) and was soon riding 10 miles a day. When he saw that traditional bicycle shops didn't meet the needs of unicyclists (they have to go to skateboard shops to find wrist pads, for example), he started Unicycle.com and now sells more than 200 items. Within eight months, his monthly income from the site was higher than his monthly paycheck from his job, and it was clear to his bosses at the computer company that his mind was elsewhere. ''They asked me for my badge,'' he said.</p>
        <p>We are deep into territory that even my mother could not have imagined. But in this new world, where people can play video games for a living and where every hobby is a potential career, what does it mean to simply relax?</p>
        <p>''Not that I'm complaining,'' Mr. Amaloo said. But after playing video games eight hours a day every day, he went on, ''I need to get out of the house.''</p>
        <p>''It's stressful,'' agreed Beth Wiley, who watches the soap opera ''All My Children'' every day and then sends out an e-mail update, AMC UP D8, to several hundred subscribers. ''The part that makes it a business -- the money, the paperwork -- that's the part that I don't like.''</p>
        <p>To cope with the pressure of watching soap operas, Ms. Wiley has taken up pottery and loves the feeling of burying her hands in new clay. She has already started giving away some of her creations, as bonuses to her subscribers. ''If I get good,'' she says, ''I can start selling the pots online.''</p>
