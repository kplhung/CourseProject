        <p>Al Gore goes Catskill.</p>
        <p>On a day when the nation's political attention seemed focused on Senator John McCain's endorsement of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for president, the notably unethnic, Southern Baptist vice president said the heck with it and tried out a borscht belt routine before a largely Jewish audience here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore, whose family comes from Tennessee, told the Anti-Defamation League that a sub-genre of music was proliferating in Nashville: the Jewish country-western song.</p>
        <p>No. 4 on the hit list, he said, was this: ''I Was One of the Chosen People -- Until She Chose Somebody Else.'' No. 3: ''The Second Time She Said 'Shalom,' I Knew She Meant Goodbye.'' No. 2: ''I've Got My Foot on the Glass, Now Where Are You?''</p>
        <p>And No. 1, which the vice president sang with a soft lilt and a twang: ''Mommas, Don't Let Your Ungrateful Sons Grow Up to Be Cowboys When They Could Very Easily Just Have Taken Over the Family Business That My Own Grandfather Broke His Back to Start and My Father Sweated Over for Years, Which Apparently Doesn't Mean Anything Now That You're Turning Your Back on Such a Gift.''</p>
        <p>The audience applauded and roared with laughter.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore really wanted to get in on the McCain-Bush act.</p>
        <p>He has been struggling for weeks against the attention paid to Senator McCain who, despite suspending his presidential campaign, remains enormously popular.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Gore, who has been lagging in the polls behind Mr. Bush, is still overtly courting the independent-minded voters who were attracted to Mr. McCain's candidacy.</p>
        <p>On April 30, Mr. Gore met privately with Mr. McCain at the Naval Observatory here, the vice president's official residence. And today, his little humor routine aside, Mr. Gore used his speech to about 450 members of the Anti-Defamation League to draw a contrast between Mr. McCain and Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Without naming the two Republicans, Mr. Gore said it was wrong not to condemn South Carolina's flying the Confederate battle flag atop the Statehouse in Columbia. Mr. Bush has said repeatedly that it is up to the state to decide whether to bring it down. Mr. McCain said the same thing in the Republican primaries, but last month he expressed regret for not having spoken out against the flag, saying he was afraid that such a stand would have cost him votes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said today of the flag issue: ''We know it is wrong not only to support it, but to find it impossible to summon the moral courage to speak out about it. It is wrong to remain silent about it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's remarks allowed room for Mr. McCain's reversal but not for Mr. Bush's continued refusal to condemn the flying of the flag.</p>
        <p>The speech was an official one as vice president, and the league is a tax-exempt organization that cannot endorse political candidates. But it was certainly a political speech, designed to paint Mr. Bush as an extremist and undermine any impression that Mr. McCain's endorsement might make Mr. Bush more acceptable to independents.</p>
        <p>Independent voters are definitely on Mr. Gore's mind. Much of his campaign since March, when he won enough delegates to secure the Democratic nomination, has been geared toward swing voters in battleground states like Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Ohio and Pennsylvania. And just as he has been wooing McCain supporters, Mr. Gore has also been going after the backers of Jesse Ventura, the independent governor of Minnesota.</p>
        <p>As it happened, Mr. Ventura was at the White House this morning for a pep rally in support of permanent trade relations with China, and Mr. Gore singled him out for thanks, among others, as did President Clinton. Last month, Mr. Gore also had a private dinner with Governor Ventura and his wife at the vice-presidential residence.</p>
        <p>The gateway topic for Mr. Gore to cozy up to both Mr. McCain and Mr. Ventura has been overhauling the campaign finance system, and aides said they expected the vice president to explore the topic publicly with both as the campaign progressed.</p>
        <p>Even though Mr. Gore's speech to the league poked fun at his own obvious differences with his audience, he still hoped to convey his commitment to their causes. ''I feel right at home here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's commitments included support for a national law against hate crimes. This amounted to another dig at Mr. Bush, who critics have said failed to shepherd through such a law in Texas. In a speech that extolled the virtues of tolerance, he sprinkled his comments with references to famous Jews.</p>
        <p>''Freud once spoke about the narcissism of slight difference, just as Einstein taught that the most destructive power known on earth is within the smallest state we know -- the inside of the atom,'' Mr. Gore said. ''The smallest differences sometimes unleash the most horrific violence.''</p>
        <p>He also won applause when he used the Hebrew phrase ''refua shlayma,'' to wish a complete recovery to Abraham Foxman, the league's national director, who recently underwent heart surgery.</p>
        <p>Still, Howard Berkowitz, national chairman of the league, said it was concerned that both candidates were injecting too much religion into the campaign. ''We want to make sure that one candidate doesn't out-religion the other,'' he said, citing Mr. Bush's comment that Jesus was his favorite philosopher. ''These things are better left in private,'' Mr. Berkowitz said.</p>
