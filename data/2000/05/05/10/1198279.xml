        <p>AS it did last year, New York dominated the top chef and restaurant awards given on Monday night by the James Beard Foundation at its annual gala.</p>
        <p>David Bouley won the chef of the year award for Danube, Andrew Carmellini of Cafe Boulud was named the rising star, and Tom Colicchio and Claudia Fleming, both chefs at Gramercy Tavern, were winners. Mr. Colicchio gained best New York City chef honors, and Ms. Fleming was pastry chef of the year. Chanterelle won for best restaurant service, and the Brasserie for restaurant design and graphic design. Drew Nieporent, the restaurant owner, was given the humanitarian award.</p>
        <p>The country's outstanding restaurant award went to Charlie Trotter's in Chicago.</p>
        <p>The event, at the Marriott Marquis, was attended by more than 1,000 people in the food world, who were served Italian dishes at the reception prepared by 32 restaurants, including 4 from Italy. Fittingly, Marcella Hazan, the author of many Italian cookbooks, was given a lifetime achievement award, and her cookbook ''Classic Italian Cooking'' was installed in the foundation's Cookbook Hall of Fame.</p>
        <p>''A Mediterranean Feast'' by Clifford Wright (William Morrow, $35) was named cookbook of the year. Other  honored books included ''The Oxford Companion to Food,'' edited by Alan Davidson (Oxford University Press, $60); ''American Home Cooking'' by Cheryl Alters Jamison and Bill Jamison (Broadway Books, $30); ''Julia and Jacques Cooking at Home'' by Julia Child and Jacques Pepin (Alfred A. Knopf, $40); and ''A Spoonful of Ginger'' by Nina Simonds (Alfred A. Knopf, $30).</p>
        <p>The James Beard Foundation, named after the culinarian, who died in 1985, has presented its awards since 1991.</p>
