        <p>At least 6 of the 15 members of the European Union have expressed a readiness to work toward suspending sanctions imposed on Austria, raising hopes here that the measures may be lifted within the next few months.</p>
        <p>Austrian officials identified the countries as Spain, Italy, Ireland, Greece, Finland and Denmark. Hubert Vedrine, the French foreign minister, confirmed that ''six or seven countries'' now wanted to ''think over'' the sanctions imposed three months ago to protest the inclusion of Jorg Haider's rightist Freedom Party in the government.</p>
        <p>France is not among those countries, and the determination to set a moral standard for the European Union by making clear that parties like Mr. Haider's are not welcome in government remains strong in Paris, Brussels and Berlin. But a less confrontational approach to Austria now seems apparent.</p>
        <p>A photograph splashed here of a smiling Joschka Fischer, the German foreign minister, holding an umbrella over the Austrian foreign minister, Benita Ferrero-Waldner, as she stood beside Mr. Vedrine at a European Union meeting held on Sunday summed up the change of mood. Only recently, French and German ministers were shunning their Austrian counterparts at such gatherings.</p>
        <p>The sanctions, which consist of a downgrading of relations with Austria that crimps the activities of Austrian ambassadors, have prompted heated debate in Europe because they represent an unparalleled intrusion in the internal affairs of a member. Austria was punished despite the fact that Mr. Haider's intermittent revisionist views and his party's anti-immigrant bigotry have remained at the level of words rather than deeds.</p>
        <p>''Europe is listening to us again and that is the first, and extremely positive step,'' Ms. Ferrero-Waldner, who is a member of the conservative People's Party, said here on Monday. At the same time, she warned against ''overoptimism'' with respect to a lifting of the sanctions.</p>
        <p>Belgium, facing its own problems with the rising rightist party called Vlaams Blok, remains the most vehement in its insistence that the sanctions not be eased until the Freedom Party leaves the government, European Union officials said.</p>
        <p>Jacques Chirac, the French president whom Mr. Haider has referred to as ''a pocket Napoleon,'' is also reluctant to seek a compromise. The German government of Gerhard Schroder would certainly not be the first to take any conciliatory step that might appear to condone the rise of a rightist party in Europe.</p>
        <p>The 14 governments that have imposed the sanctions acted individually but in unison, and it is likely that they will continue to do so. If they do retreat from their position while the Freedom Party remains in government, they face the problem that their decision will immediately be portrayed by Mr. Haider as a vindication and a victory.</p>
        <p>But maintaining the measures has a growing price, too. Internal opposition to the measures is rising in some member countries, particularly Germany, and Central European candidates for membership in the Union, traumatized by long subservience to Moscow, are not happy at the idea that a member's sovereignty is so reduced.</p>
        <p>In Germany, the opposition Christian Democrats, who have been vehement in their denunciation of the measures, have recently been joined by some members of Mr. Schroder's coalition partner, the Greens. Christian Sterzing, a spokesman on foreign affairs for the Greens, said the measures had been ''too hasty'' and that France and Belgium had ''overreacted.''</p>
        <p>Joschka Fischer, the Green foreign minister, does not share those views, officials said. But his ministry is deeply divided over sanctions that were imposed with unusual speed and without any clear idea of the circumstances in which they might be lifted.</p>
        <p>The proposal of Austria is that the sanctions, which include a refusal to receive Austrian ambassadors at anything above ''official level,'' could be ''temporarily suspended'' while international monitors, perhaps drawn from the European Commission, kept an eye on the acts of the government.</p>
        <p>Officials said this idea would now be studied before a summit meeting of European Union leaders convenes on June 19. But Rudolf Scharping, the German defense minister, said there was ''no plan'' to lift the sanctions.</p>
        <p>The quandary over the sanctions has been accentuated by the recent behavior of Mr. Haider. After stepping down from the leadership of his party and adopting a quieter tone for a few weeks, he has roared back throwing punches left and right. He has called Mr. Schroder an ''opportunist,'' restated his desire to become chancellor, and vowed to make his party, now the second force in Austria, ''No. 1.''</p>
