        <p>Popularity has its complications.</p>
        <p>Under an onslaught of money from investors, Janus said yesterday that it would close three funds, including the $42 billion Janus Worldwide, the nation's largest fund with an international bent. The closings would become effective today. (Existing shareholders would still be able to add to their positions.)</p>
        <p>The move, a year after the company closed the popular $35.4 billion Janus Twenty, would mean that nearly half of Janus' 15 equity funds would be closed to new shareholders. Such closings are a common practice in the industry to keep the assets in any given fund from growing too large to be effectively managed.</p>
        <p>The last 16 months have brought great success to Janus, the Denver mutual fund company known for its aggressive stock-picking style. Last year, 28 cents of every dollar invested in mutual funds went to Janus, according to the fund tracking firm AMG Data Services, and the growth has only accelerated of late. In the first four months of this year, the firm's equity funds took in $31 billion more, nearly equaling the company's inflows for all of last year and propelling Janus from the 20th-biggest mutual fund concern at the end of 1998 to the fifth at the end of March.</p>
        <p>That was so much money that several managers requested the closings, which, by Janus policy, is within their discretion. ''It will slow the flows,' said Stephen Stieneker, a Janus spokesman. ''We hope it will allow us to continue the performance our investors expect.''</p>
        <p>Unlike Fidelity and Vanguard, which offer a diverse slate of funds covering dozens of sectors and investment styles, Janus made its name by offering relatively few funds largely focused on aggressive stocks, and by making some prescient bets in the technology and telecommunications sectors.</p>
        <p>The focused approach has meant that several of the same stocks appear in the portfolios of different Janus funds, so if one Janus fund is closed, investors may find a similar investing style in another offering.</p>
        <p>''For investors, you need to keep in mind that you're getting somewhat similar exposure,'' said Christine Benz, a senior analyst at the fund tracking firm Morningstar. For the company, ''the challenge is that they'll need to develop the other parts of their product line.''</p>
        <p>Janus added a value-oriented fund this year and two sector funds, one focused on technology and one on health stocks, at the end of 1998. The health fund, Janus Global Life Sciences, was one of those closed today, along with the $8 billion Janus Olympus. The technology sector fund was closed earlier in the year.</p>
        <p>While Janus executives consider how best to handle their growth, they also must navigate an even more delicate situation -- Janus' impending spinoff from its parent company, Kansas City Southern Industries. Janus executives, including Thomas H. Bailey, the founder and chief executive, have criticized Kansas City Southern's plan to package Janus along with its three other financial holdings into a subsidiary called Stilwell Financial. Janus executives would prefer to be spun off as a separate company.</p>
        <p>Kansas City Southern executives have rejected that suggestion, and they expect the spinoff to proceed as soon as they receive regulatory approval. Still, the future of Janus will remain with Janus, Kansas City Southern officials say.</p>
        <p>''My philosophy has been that you don't change a winning formula,'' said James R. Jones, a former chief executive of the American Stock Exchange and current member of Kansas City Southern's board. ''It's an industry with a lot of strong personalities, and they speak their mind.''</p>
