        <p>A request from Patrick M. Dorismond's family yesterday for copies of his autopsy and toxicology reports was denied.

        <p>Mr. Sells said the family might exhume Mr. Dorismond's body and have tests done to verify the accuracy of the toxicology report, which said there were small amounts of marijuana in Mr. Dorismond's blood.</p>
