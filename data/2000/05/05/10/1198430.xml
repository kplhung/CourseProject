        <p>A young Wyckoff woman sent to prison for manslaughter in the death of her newborn son in a Delaware motel is scheduled to be freed from a Delaware prison today.</p>
        <p>The woman, Amy S. Grossberg, 21, was sentenced to 30 months in prison in July 1998 for contributing to the death of the baby in November 1996. After serving 22 months, she will be released from Baylor Women's Correctional Institution in New Castle, Del., because of good behavior and participation in prison work programs and classes, said Elizabeth Welch, a spokeswoman for the Delaware Department of Correction.</p>
        <p>Ms. Grossberg's lawyer, John S. Malik of Wilmington, Del., said she planned to return to her parents' home in Wyckoff, an affluent suburb in western Bergen County.</p>
        <p>Her former high school sweetheart and co-defendant, Brian C. Peterson, 21, was freed in January after serving 18 months of a two-year term. He discarded the baby in a motel Dumpster minutes after the birth, but received a shorter sentence because he gave the authorities a statement about the birth and disposal of the infant. The couple contended that the baby was stillborn, and they were ultimately allowed to plead guilty to manslaughter.</p>
