        <p>THE terms ''instant gratification'' and ''dessert'' usually don't go together, unless you're talking about a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry's. Lauren Chattman aims to reconcile the concepts in her new book, ''Instant Gratification'' (William Morrow, $22). She promises 110 desserts that can be made in less than 15 minutes, without the help of packaged mixes or prepared ingredients.</p>
        <p>''No boxed brownie mixes, Jello-O or marshmallow fluff,'' Ms. Chattman pledges. Nor does she cheat by dressing up store-bought ice cream or poundcake with a few berries or a quick sauce. Ms. Chattman craves classic cakes, cookies and tarts that rely on premium ingredients like vanilla beans, high-quality chocolate and ripe fresh fruit. And her recipe roster is inventive and appealing: lemon cream cupcakes, tea-infused panna cotta, giant coconut-cashew cookies, peach-cardamom crumble.</p>

        <p>THE terms ''instant gratification'' and ''dessert'' usually don't go together, unless you're talking about a pint of Ben &amp; Jerry's. Lauren Chattman aims to reconcile the concepts in her new book, ''Instant Gratification'' (William Morrow, $22). She promises 110 desserts that can be made in less than 15 minutes, without the help of packaged mixes or prepared ingredients.</p>
        <p>''No boxed brownie mixes, Jello-O or marshmallow fluff,'' Ms. Chattman pledges. Nor does she cheat by dressing up store-bought ice cream or poundcake with a few berries or a quick sauce. Ms. Chattman craves classic cakes, cookies and tarts that rely on premium ingredients like vanilla beans, high-quality chocolate and ripe fresh fruit. And her recipe roster is inventive and appealing: lemon cream cupcakes, tea-infused panna cotta, giant coconut-cashew cookies, peach-cardamom crumble.</p>
        <p>But all put together in 15 minutes? It sounded too good to be true.</p>
        <p>And strictly speaking, it was. After a weekend of baking, I found only a handful of the desserts could be made that quickly -- and Ms. Chattman does cheat a little on the timing. She doesn't count baking, cooling or chilling times, or the minutes it takes to assemble the ingredients. The preparations can be the most time-consuming part of cooking, and frankly, if you timed any recipe after that was done, there's a good chance it would come in at under 15 minutes.</p>
        <p>But in the end, a few extra minutes isn't a huge investment when the desserts are as clever and delicious as these.</p>
        <p>The lemon cream cupcakes had a tender yellow cake that enclosed a creamy, tart lemon filling that was made with just cream cheese, lemon and sugar. It may have taken 30 minutes to get those cupcakes into the oven, but there was no need to fuss with frosting once they were out.</p>
        <p>The chocolate mousse cake required only three ingredients -- chocolate, eggs and butter -- and had a texture like velvet and a wickedly fudgy flavor.</p>
        <p>The Amazing Almost Instant Warm Brownies actually took 23 minutes but were amazing nonetheless: the recipe is conventional, but they are baked in the microwave. Microwaved desserts are usually rubbery and oddly textured; the brownies emerged intense, gooey and satisfying.</p>
        <p>There were some desserts that lived up to the 15-minute claim: fragrant, wobbly tea-infused panna cotta made it into the refrigerator to chill in just 13 minutes. Elegant roasted figs with ricotta and honey took only 15 minutes from start to finish (including roasting), as did the warm peach gratin with sour cream.</p>
        <p>Ms. Chattman also offers smart time-savers, like using quick-cooking polenta in place of regular cornmeal in an Indian pudding, and good, day-old sourdough bread as a very fast base for a nectarine tart.</p>
        <p>All these ideas, like the recipes, are creative gems, ones I'd happily use again. But without the stopwatch.</p>
        <p>LEMON CREAM CUPCAKES  Adapted from ''Instant Gratification''  Time: 50 minutes</p>
        <p>Nonstick cooking spray  1 1/2 cups sugar</p>
        <p>3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter  6 large eggs</p>
        <p>1/4 cup fresh lemon juice  2 1/4 cups cake or all-purpose flour  3 teaspoons grated lemon zest  1 1/2 teaspoons baking powder</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>3/4 cup cream cheese, softened  Confectioners' sugar, optional.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Coat a muffin tin with nonstick cooking spray.</p>
        <p>2. In bowl of an electric mixer, beat 1 1/4 cups sugar and the butter at medium speed until light and fluffy. Add eggs and 3 tablespoons lemon juice, and beat until well combined, scraping down bowl once or twice as necessary. Mix in flour, 2 teaspoons lemon zest, baking powder and salt.</p>
        <p>3. In a small bowl, mash together cream cheese and remaining sugar, lemon juice and zest.</p>
        <p>4. Spoon about 3 tablespoons batter into each muffin cup. Place about 1 tablespoon cream cheese mixture on top, and cover cheese with some remaining batter (batter should reach three-quarters of the way to top of each cup). Bake until golden, about 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>5. Let cupcakes cool in pan for 10 minutes before turning over onto wire rack to cool completely. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving, if desired.</p>
        <p>Yield: 12 servings.</p>
        <p>TEA-INFUSED PANNA COTTA  Adapted from ''Instant Gratification''  Time: 13 minutes, plus 6 hours' chilling</p>
        <p>3 cups half-and-half  6 tablespoons sugar  2 bags strong tea like Earl Grey or Darjeeling  1 packet (2 teaspoons) unflavored gelatin.</p>
        <p>1. In a medium saucepan, heat 1 1/2 cups half-and-half and the sugar, whisking to dissolve sugar. Bring mixture just to a boil and then remove from heat. Add tea bags and let steep for 5 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, bring 1 inch of water to a bare simmer in the bottom of a double boiler or saucepan. Pour remaining half-and-half into top of double boiler or a stainless steel bowl. Sprinkle gelatin over half-and-half and let sit on kitchen counter for 5 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. Remove the tea bags from the half-and-half. Set the gelatin mixture over simmering water, and add the tea mixture. Whisk until the gelatin is completely dissolved, about 2 to 3 minutes. Pour mixture into six ramekins. Cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until set, at least 6 hours or overnight.</p>
        <p>4. To unmold panna cottas, fill a small bowl with very hot tap water. Run a paring knife around panna cottas to separate them from ramekins, then dip bottom half of each ramekin in the water for 30 seconds. Place a dessert plate on top of mold, invert, tap the bottom of the mold and lift the mold off the plate.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
