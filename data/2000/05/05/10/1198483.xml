        <p>Boomer Esiason, who was fired two months ago from ABC's Monday Night Football, says his newest venture is not your stereotypical athlete dot-com.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Esiason announced yesterday a link between his foundation, which raises money to fight cystic fibrosis, and ClickThings!com, a new Internet company that lets businesses create, manage and edit their own Web sites free.</p>
        <p>The Boomer Esiason Foundation will become a sponsor of ClickThings!com and users will be able to click onto the foundation's logo to reach its Web site. ClickThings!com users who create their own Web sites using the address www.clickthings.com can also carry the foundation logo as a sponsor for their customers to click onto.</p>
        <p>As for his TV career, Esiason said he is looking at pending offers.</p>
        <p>Another retired quarterback, Dan Marino, joined HBO Sports yesterday as the fifth panelist on Inside the NFL.</p>
        <p>Marino said he was not interested in the open slot at Monday Night Football because he wants to spend weekends with his family.</p>
        <p>Ross Greenburg, executive producer of HBO Sports, said he had held serious talks with Bill Parcells, who chose to remain a Jets executive. ''He was very ambivalent about coming back to television,'' he said.</p>
