        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your May 9 news article ''New Model for Soldiers in Germany: A Sergeant of 1941 Who Saved Jews,'' about the renaming of a base to honor Anton Schmid, brings to memory another Schmid or Schmidt, who was one of many German guards overseeing our group. We were slave laborers building a railroad link near Minsk in 1942.</p>

        <p>Your May 9 news article ''New Model for Soldiers in Germany: A Sergeant of 1941 Who Saved Jews,'' about the renaming of a base to honor Anton Schmid, brings to memory another Schmid or Schmidt, who was one of many German guards overseeing our group. We were slave laborers building a railroad link near Minsk in 1942.</p>
        <p>I was one of hundreds marched from the ghetto each day to the place of work. We were often beaten, harassed and harangued by the guards.</p>
        <p>Schmidt was the exception. He used every occasion he had to help us obtain food and showed understanding for our plight, a phenomenon so rare in those days.</p>
