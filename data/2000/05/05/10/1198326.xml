        <p>MY husband missed our son's high school graduation due to business travel. None of us has ever forgotten.''</p>
        <p>A lot of words were spoken at the World Bank's two-day symposium late last month Stress, the Business Traveler and Corporate Health in Washington. But those two declarative sentences, among the many responses elicited by World Bank managers who surveyed traveling staff members and their spouses, packed real wallop. ''None of us has ever forgotten.''</p>
        <p>Corporate America, which often prides itself on the supposed invincibility of the legions of men and women it dispatches around the world, could learn a few things about employee health and welfare from the World Bank. The last two years, the bank has sponsored seminars intended to make employers think more responsibly about the effect ever-increasing travel has on employees and on the people closest to them.</p>
        <p>The World Bank, an international organization based in Washington, sends nearly 5,000 employees on international business trips each year, for a total of more than 250,000 days away from home. In 1997, the World Bank sponsored a detailed clinical study that discovered that significantly higher rates of health insurance claims were filed by employees who traveled compared with those who did not. Even more remarkable, frequent travelers, who typically regard themselves as tough and resilient, also account for three times the  claims for treatment of stress, anxiety, depression and other psychological-adjustment disorders attributable directly to the demands of being on the road.</p>
        <p>This year, prompted by that 1997 study, the bank convened health professionals and managers from 50 corporate and government organizations to discuss follow-up research that was commissioned to examine more closely the psychological impact of frequent business travel.</p>
        <p>''We asked our colleagues what's going on?'' said Bernhard H. Liese, a senior health adviser and the former medical director of the bank.</p>
        <p>The answer that came back, Dr. Liese said, was that adverse effects from travel were ''mirrored in the family'' as well as in the workplace.</p>
        <p>The 1997 clinical study compared health insurance claims filed by 4,700 World Bank managers and professional workers who had taken international business trips with claims filed by 6,000 World Bank employees who did not travel. Across the board, the survey showed a strong correlation between frequency of travel and higher reports of respiratory infections, gastrointestinal distress, skin disorders and back pain -- all understandable, if somewhat surprising, consequences of heavy travel to a wide variety of places.</p>
        <p>But the survey's findings of far higher rates of treatment for psychological disorders were especially startling, Dr. Liese said. That is because only about a third of the World Bank's employees in Washington are from North America. The rest come from countries where there is far greater reluctance ''to seek treatment from a psychologist,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The follow-up survey on the risks of that psychological stress was by the same team of clinical researchers, which reported: ''As international business travel grows, increasing numbers of travelers will be exposed to health risks, including widely varying physical and psychological stressors.'' In the their report, published in the scientific journal Occupational and Environmental Medicine, they added that ''business travel is a unique challenge to the health of employees, which to date has not been studied extensively.''</p>
        <p>High on the list of emotional stresses for heavy business travelers is worry about personal and family lives, including adjustment problems suffered by spouses and children of an employee who is often away from home. Anxiety about the workload piling up back at the office also ranked high on the stress list.</p>
        <p>Typically, the researchers said, traveling employees are disinclined to take time off to rest from a tiring business trip. ''Although most respondents think it is necessary, very few of them reported that they actually take rest days after business travel,'' the study said.</p>
        <p>Of course, some corporations and bosses pride themselves on instilling a gung-ho workplace culture that presses worn-out corporate travelers to hit the road on demand and show up at the office bright and early on return, no matter where they flew in from the night before.</p>
        <p>''Two-thirds of all respondents reported that their managers rarely or never formally grant'' a day off after a long trip, reflecting a perceived lack of sanction for taking rest.</p>
        <p>Participants at the symposium heard a lot of practical advice on making life easier on traveling employees: train managers to be aware that changing travel dates at the last minute can adversely affect people's lives; be more flexible in allowing travelers to make their own arrangements and to exercise more control over their lives when they are on the road; compensate traveling employees for their weekends; let them call home daily on the company's nickel.</p>
        <p>But the most resonant message came from Dr. Liese, who said more attention must be paid to ''corporate responsibilities'' in employee travel, an area that lies beyond the reach of any governmental workplace or health-and-safety regulator.</p>
        <p>Corporations should be accountable, Dr. Liese said, ''to their most valuable resource -- their staff.''</p>
