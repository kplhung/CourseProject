        <p>THE bus was late leaving Columbus Circle and got caught in a doozy of a Manhattan traffic jam. But there were no complaints about the hour or two lost. These passengers measure wasted time in years.</p>
        <p>Anthony Papa spent 12 years in prison for making a delivery of four and a half ounces of cocaine in exchange for $500. ''I was desperate,'' he said. ''I was young and stupid.'' It was his first offense, but the state's Rockefeller-era drug laws demanded a minimum sentence of 15 years. His wife divorced him and he lost a chunk of his life, but he earned three degrees in prison and became an artist. Gov. George E. Pataki granted him clemency three years ago, opening a rare escape hatch from the tough drug sentences.</p>
        <p>''That's why I'm on this bus,'' Mr. Papa said, ''to humanize this experience. There are people who made mistakes. They deserve a second chance.''</p>
        <p>Rolling up the New York Thruway to Albany on Monday to an annual rally against  the drug laws, the bus hauled broken lives, hope lost and regained, tales of endurance. The passengers wanted to shake up lawmakers who concede that the laws are too harsh but who themselves seem shackled, by conflicting political agendas.</p>
        <p>Regina Stevens was in the first seat. Her son Terrence Stevens is serving 15 years to life for possession of five ounces of cocaine. He is largely paralyzed from the neck down with muscular dystrophy, which struck him as a teenager.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stevens is spirited and realistic. She lives in a Manhattan housing project, works at three jobs and acknowledges past drug use. ''The street got me,'' she said, ''but I was determined not to let the street get my children.'' It got one of them, fairly or unfairly. She believes her son's claims of innocence, but says, ''even if he did it, 15 years is too much time.''</p>
        <p>Near the back of the bus, 73-year-old Eileen Flournoy sat with two granddaughters. The little girls were cute and talkative and favorite subjects for photographers at the rally. But they were there because their mother is not. She's serving an eight-year-to-life sentence for drug possession. ''The drugs took over,'' Ms. Flournoy said of her daughter Veronica, the girls' mother. ''She got involved with the wrong people.''</p>
        <p>The bus riders pleaded for sense, not sympathy.</p>
        <p>''Twelve years, 4 months, 17 days,'' said Jan Warren, sitting in the middle of the bus in a sundress, recounting her time served for possession and sale of just under eight ounces of cocaine. Minimum sentences for manslaughter and rape are shorter than Rockefeller-era drug sentences. ''There's no logic,'' said Ms. Warren, who was granted clemency and released in January.</p>
        <p>Ms. Warren doesn't excuse the system,  or herself. She transported drugs to make money. ''I was trying to start a new life,'' she said. ''I was trying to get out of a relationship. I was pregnant. I wanted to go out West, where my family was. I made bad choices.''</p>
        <p>At 48, she's trying to start again -- working, finishing college, meeting her 10-month-old granddaughter. But her head is full of prison images, including the one that got her on the bus trip, sponsored by the Kunstler Center for Racial Justice in New York. The day she left Bedford Hills Correctional Center, prisoners rushed to the windows of the prison school to wave and cheer. The sun on the windows erased their faces, and all she could see were hands. ''You just wanted to reach out and bring them with you,'' she said.</p>
        <p>THE rally hardly altered the debate. About 200 protesters gathered between the steep Capitol steps and the backside of an imposing statute of Gen. Philip Henry Sheridan astride a horse. Assemblyman Marty A. Luster, a Democrat from Ithaca, was one of several speakers urging them on. But later he said the lawmakers appeared paralyzed by ''political fear.''</p>
        <p>''There's fear that we're going to be seen as soft on crime,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The people on the bus know about wasted time. The long trip to Albany didn't qualify.</p>
        <p>Back in Columbus Circle, Henry Clemente exited the bus and headed to his night job cleaning city buses. His son is in prison on a long drug sentence. When arrested, his son was a student at the University of Pennsylvania. The tales on the bus were tangled, the truth obscure. But so are the politics of the drug laws.</p>
        <p>''He's in there,'' Mr. Clemente said of his son. ''You can hardly help him. It's emotions. In speaking out, you release a lot of built-up emotion. It gives you a little release. You hope that someone will hear that.''</p>
