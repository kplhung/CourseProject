        <p>NTT DoCoMo, Japan's largest mobile phone company, agreed today to acquire a 15 percent stake in the Dutch mobile phone operator KPN Mobile for about $4.5 billion.</p>
        <p>The deal is NTT DoCoMo's first move into Europe as part of an expansion beyond Japan by its parent company, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone. It also gives KPN Mobile, a unit of Royal KPN, a powerful ally in the intense competition for Europe's mobile phone market. NTT DoCoMo was the first to give customers the ability to browse on the Internet using mobile phones.</p>
        <p>The two companies are likely to team up to bid for Orange P.L.C.,  Britain's third-largest telephone operator. Orange is expected to be put up for sale by Vodafone AirTouch P.L.C., which must divest itself of Orange as a condition of its $183 billion acquisition of Mannesmann A.G., the German telecommunications company that it bought a few months ago. Analysts expect a fierce bidding war for Orange, which is expected to cost about $50 billion.</p>
        <p>''We think that we've become much more attractive for Orange,'' said Joop Dreschel, a board member of KPN.</p>
        <p>The deal comes less than a week after merger talks between Royal KPN and Telefonica of Spain collapsed, leading the Dutch telephone company to reach an agreement with NTT DoCoMo.</p>
        <p>Beyond the stake NTT DoCoMo is buying in KPN Mobile, the two companies will become strategic partners, developing a team to create next-generation mobile Internet services in Europe based on NTT DoCoMo's i-mode technology, which creates a continuous mobile Internet connection. The i-mode service became so popular in Japan that NTT DoCoMo has curtailed the signing up of new users.</p>
        <p>Dr. Keiji Tachikawa, the president and chief executive of NTT DoCoMo, said that buying a stake in KPN was part of a larger overall strategy to enter Europe. ''We have closely followed developments in the exciting European mobile communications market,'' he said.</p>
        <p>NTT DoCoMo's foreign alliance is  part of a broader strategy by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone to expand internationally. On Monday, its NTT Communications Corporation subsidiary purchased Verio, a leading Web site manager in the United States, for $5.5 billion.</p>
        <p>For Royal KPN, which has an alliance with Qwest Communications International of the United States and which is partly owned by BellSouth, the agreement with NTT DoCoMo will give the company an advantage in bringing mobile interactive services to Europe that are far more advanced than the current offerings.</p>
        <p>Shares of KPN, which had risen close to 8 percent last week after it  confirmed it was negotiating with Telefonica, fell today to 109.93 euros, or $99.875, because of investor anxiety that KPN will be forced to do several smaller deals rather than one pan-European merger.</p>
