        <p>I'm 27, and I spent the first years of my life on a farm outside Fort Worth. I've always been curious. One time, when I was 4, I wanted to get into a locked room. So I got a screwdriver and took the doorknob off.</p>
        <p>As I reached third grade, it became clear it was time for me to go live with my dad. Dads tend to be a little bit more structured, a little less touchy-feely. Still, school bored me. I'd get discounted on a paper because I didn't follow the procedure. And I'd say to the teachers, ''But I got to the answer faster.'' They didn't care. My attitude was, ''whatever.''</p>
        <p>To satisfy my curiosity, I'd try things out. My freshman year in high school, I was a member of R.O.T.C. My sophomore year, I had a mohawk. Later, I got early admission to the University of Texas at Arlington. There were things I missed, like senior prom, but those functions never held a lot of interest for me.</p>
        <p>Neither did college, it turned out. I remember writing PASCAL computer programs that told you how much change -- pennies, nickels, dimes -- you should return after a transaction. I was bored out of my mind. So, like that Monty Python skit, I started thinking, ''And now for something completely different.''</p>
        <p>I went to talk to the military recruiters. But none of the jobs looked interesting except counterintelligence, and until you're pretty senior in counterintelligence, you're basically a gofer. The next day I realized I wanted to try to become an Airborne Ranger in the Army. There aren't that many Rangers, and the washout rate is tremendous. It sounded like an amazing challenge.</p>
        <p>After we had learned how to jump out of airplanes, we went into the Ranger indoctrination program. These are basically three weeks to see if you really want to be a Ranger or if you thought it sounded cool. We crawled through the mud in the middle of the night. We did push-ups until we couldn't push anymore and then rolled over and did flutter kicks until we couldn't do any more and then rolled back over and did push-ups.</p>
        <p>It was constant, incessant physical, mental and emotional harassment. I wasn't bored anymore, that's for sure.</p>
        <p>Because I had done hunting as a kid, they made me a sniper. Sometimes we'd get on a plane at dusk, go do something in another country and be back at dawn. I never shot anyone, though. It was almost all training exercises. You get this mindset that ''I'm a Ranger.'' Everything else becomes irrelevant. But by the end of my time, I would look at my bunkmate and think, ''Is his life worth a mission that may not affect the quality of life in the United States?'' I wasn't sure.</p>
        <p>Ranger school prepared me more than anything else for what I do now -- managing in the controlled chaos of the Internet. If you can execute a mission under stress and motivate people who are worn down, then getting a group of people -- who did eat today and did sleep last night -- aligned around a common vision is not that difficult.</p>
        <p>After the Army, I went back to college, but I dropped out again to take a job at Microsoft. Then, Microsoft made a hard left to respond to the Internet. That drove me and two colleagues to start our company. Our venture capitalists were our American Express and Visa cards.</p>
        <p>Microsoft taught us to focus on the long term. Our stock is worth about a third of what it was in March. But we know we're building something. A stock price is like climbing up a ladder with a yo-yo. If you watch the yo-yo, you'll miss the big picture.</p>
