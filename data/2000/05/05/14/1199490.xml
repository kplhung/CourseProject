        <p>THEY say necessity is the mother of invention, but desperation can also be its source.

        <p>THEY say necessity is the mother of invention, but desperation can also be its source. In Colombia, a government frustrated by its inability to end three decades of warfare with two major guerrilla insurgencies is now seeking peace by granting both movements one of the things they crave most: uncontested territory they can call their own.</p>
        <p>The move is not without logic, though its many critics contend that the logic is deeply flawed. The idea was that pulling troops out of what were already rebel  strongholds could create an atmosphere of good will in peace talks. But that hasn't really happened so far, and so the effect has been somewhat different: Colombia has formally recognized that it doesn't exercise full sovereignty over all its territory.</p>
        <p>That has left the two zones a kind of never-never land where it is not clear who is in charge or how the zones fit into the rest of the country.</p>
        <p>''You are seeing, in a sense, the hollowing-out of government in critical regions of Latin America and its replacement by individuals who are, in fact, introducing a narco-government, a small narco-empire,'' Peter Romero, the State Department's senior official for Latin American affairs, warned last week.</p>
        <p>The creation of these two insurgent-controlled areas began 18 months ago, when the government ceded 16,000 square miles to Colombia's largest guerrilla group, known as the Farc, in an effort to jump-start peace talks. But the talks have faltered, and the Farc has only become more powerful. It acts increasingly like a parallel government and is now planning a ''peace tax'' on wealthy people and companies in the zone.</p>
        <p>The government's move also left Colombia's other big rebel group, known as the E.L.N., intensely jealous. So the group began a sabotage and kidnapping campaign, to which President Andres Pastrana responded last month by agreeing to concede it a second zone.</p>
        <p>Latin America has had its share of insurgencies, but even at the height of the Central American civil wars of the 1980's there was never an arrangement quite like this. Guerrillas exercised de facto control of parts of El Salvador and contras ranged freely over northern Nicaragua, but they certainly did not do so with the consent of the governments they were fighting.</p>
        <p>The latest concession has not gone over well with ordinary Colombians, especially those who must live in the area that is to become a haven for the E.L.N., or Army of National Liberation. In February and March, residents blocked highways to protest the plan, pointing to the creation of the earlier guerrilla safe zone as a naive experiment gone totally wrong.</p>
        <p>As originally envisioned in the agreement with the Farc, or Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, only soldiers and police were to be withdrawn from the so-called zone of disarmament, which is larger than Connecticut, Massachusetts and Rhode Island combined. But the Farc eventually drove mayors, judges, prosecutors, tax collectors and priests out, implanting its own authority -- and inviting in coca producers.</p>
        <p>SO in all but name, the first demilitarized zone is now an entity beyond the Colombian state's control. Hence the sardonic nickname given it by its 60,000 residents: Farclandia. Passengers landing at the airport in San Vicente del Caguan have their passports and luggage inspected by rebels; guerrillas staff the city hall and residents have to deal with them when they need police protection or a road paved.</p>
        <p>The ''zone of encounter'' that is now to be handed over to the E.L.N. is barely one-tenth the size of the Farc zone, or roughly the size of Delaware, but its location is much more strategic. So the dent in Colombian sovereignty may be just as great, even though this time Mr. Pastrana has promised that all civil authorities in the area ''will continue in the exercise of their functions,'' and international observers will be allowed in to assure that the E.L.N. is honoring the agreement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pastrana's action is all the more surprising given the importance that Latin American governments traditionally attach to the concept of national sovereignty. To maintain the notion untarnished, countries like Mexico and Venezuela, for example, have turned down offers of American assistance after natural disasters, and Chile's government, though full of officials who were persecuted while Chile was under military rule, repeatedly cited sovereignty in demanding that Britain release Gen. Augusto Pinochet.</p>
        <p>But historical experience also says that sovereignty is one of those ideas, like the rule of law or military subordination to civilians, that is more honored in the breach than in practice in Latin America.</p>
        <p>In Colombia's case, sovereignty in remote areas often consists of little more than a flag and a national anthem. Guerrillas and drug traffickers can move into areas like Caqueta and Putumayo precisely because the state has never bothered -- or been able -- to build roads, schools or hospitals there, and the forlorn, neglected peasants there feel only the most tenuous of connections to the authorities back in Bogota.</p>
        <p>The Colombian state is scarcely alone in failing to back up assertions of sovereignty with meaningful actions. Many residents of the area in the heart of the Amazon, where Colombia, Peru and Brazil share a border, carry the identity cards of all three countries and use their currencies interchangeably, as if the frontier did not exist. None of those countries, however, has a history of reliably supplying services like medical care and education there; for these, citizens have had to depend on missionaries.</p>
