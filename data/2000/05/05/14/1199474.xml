        <p>WHEN La-Van Hawkins, the leading black operator of fast-food franchises in the nation, stood on the steps of the White House before President Clinton in 1996 and pledged to open 225 Burger King restaurants in several of the nation's toughest inner cities, it seemed that the company had found its urban messiah.</p>

        <p>WHEN La-Van Hawkins, the leading black operator of fast-food franchises in the nation, stood on the steps of the White House before President Clinton in 1996 and pledged to open 225 Burger King restaurants in several of the nation's toughest inner cities, it seemed that the company had found its urban messiah.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hawkins was joined there by Robert C. Lowes, at that time the chief executive of Burger King, and their partnership was celebrated as a model of how entrepreneurs and civic-minded companies, with the help of federal subsidies, could rebuild their communities at a profit.</p>
        <p>But four years later, Mr. Hawkins and Burger King, the nation's No. 2 hamburger chain, are bitter adversaries. Mr. Hawkins says his only fault was relying too much on a company's promises to mend a discriminatory past. Burger King says that, with the best intentions, it went too far in aiding a businessman who proved himself unworthy of its trust.</p>
        <p>Now the matter is in the hands of lawyers and judges. In a lawsuit accusing Burger King of racial discrimination, Mr. Hawkins contends that the company reneged on a promise to help him open 225 restaurants. He owns 25 in Atlanta, Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit and Washington, but three of them sit empty because of the disputes.</p>
        <p>''Burger King used me as a pawn to make them look good to black people and black leaders,'' Mr. Hawkins, 40, said in an interview. ''From the moment my stores became successful, this company did everything in its power to stall my plans and to bastardize my name.''</p>
        <p>Burger King, based in Miami and a subsidiary of Diageo P.L.C. of London, contends that it formally agreed to only 25 stores and that Mr. Hawkins owes $6.5 million in delinquent royalties and loans.</p>
        <p>''The 225 number is something he talked about aspiring to in his business plan,'' said Barry Blum, Burger King's general counsel. ''It was always his number. We wanted to see him succeed but with the exception of the honeymoon period of our relationship, he's absolutely failed to perform under the terms of our agreement.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hawkins and Burger King do agree that their much-celebrated partnership is history. The company wants a federal judge in Miami to bar Mr. Hawkins from using its trademark. If that happens, Mr. Hawkins would have to find other uses for the restaurants he owns, and those that he leases from Burger King would be redistributed to other qualified minority franchisees, Burger King said.</p>
        <p>Franchising experts call the whole episode a shame. But they say the battle between Burger King and Mr. Hawkins illustrates just how ardently some companies crave inner-city markets and the tax breaks that come along with doing business there.</p>
        <p>''Franchisers and minority franchisees have a love affair going on. It's given rise to remarkable success for both sides,'' said David Kaufmann, a lawyer in New York who has represented many of the nation's top franchisees and franchisers and who wrote the New York franchise disclosure law, which protects franchisees from unexpected terms and conditions. ''The companies have created all sorts of special financing programs geared toward drawing in vast numbers of minorities who weren't present before. But in franchising, it's sad but still true that there are always a small percentage of people who find themselves unable or unwilling to pay fees.''</p>
        <p>The privately held Hawkins Food Group does not depend entirely on Burger King. Mr. Hawkins also owns 89 Pizza Huts in Michigan, and only $4.1 million of his company's $14.8 million in 1999 profit came from Burger King, he said.</p>
        <p>His company also received a $10 million investment in 1996 from Robert L. Johnson, the chief executive of Black Entertainment Television and one of the nation's wealthiest blacks. In a survey covering all industrial sectors, Black Enterprise magazine ranked Mr. Hawkins among the top black franchise operators in the nation.</p>
        <p>In the beginning, the partnership between Burger King and Mr. Hawkins looked like a recipe for success.  Mr. Hawkins had already made a name for himself as the owner of 46 Checkers Drive-In Restaurants, a Southern regional chain. His stores were among the chain's most successful, together pulling in about $65 million in sales a year.</p>
        <p>Burger King, meanwhile, wanted to show off its new diversity plan, which grew out of a 1993 agreement after black franchisees contended that they were being saddled with  inferior equipment, crime-plagued locations and limited support for expansion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hawkins was one of the major beneficiaries of the plan, which allocated $100 million to recruit and retain minority franchisees and suppliers. Burger King says that it has spent several times that amount over the years and that 15 percent of its 7,705 restaurants are now run by minority operators, up from about 11 percent in 1994.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Hawkins demonstrated he knew how to run quick-service hamburger restaurants,'' said Kim Miller, a Burger King spokeswoman. ''And he certainly convinced us that he understood the particular needs of the inner city.''</p>
        <p>MR. JOHNSON said that choosing Mr. Hawkins, a big man (6 foot 4 and 280-plus pounds) with an even bigger personality, was a smart move. ''La-Van is a flamboyant guy,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''That's what it takes to create business opportunities in the neighborhoods he's prepared to go into. That's why I invested in him. He knows how to generate earnings out of franchises and he knows better than anyone how to do it in an urban market.''</p>
        <p>Much of what Mr. Hawkins learned comes from a childhood in Chicago's rough Cabrini Green housing project. At 15, he says, he was leading a gang and wrestling with a $1,000-a-week cocaine habit. With help from an uncle who owned a local McDonald's, Mr. Hawkins stumbled into the fast-food business, scrubbing toilets and floors, after dropping out of the 10th grade.</p>
        <p>He advanced to manage various McDonald's and KFC's. Mr. Hawkins said he used $800,000 in options from KFC to become an operating partner with Bojangles Fried Chicken, his last stop before Checkers.</p>
        <p>He sold his Checkers restaurants when he joined Burger King. ''They wanted the Michael Jordan of fast food,'' Mr. Hawkins said. ''And they got me by assuring me that they were out to change their culture. I believed it and I wanted to show people Burger King had changed.''</p>
        <p>He says his Burger King stores have an average of $1.9 million in annual sales, nearly double that of company-owned stores. The company would not comment on per-store sales at its restaurants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hawkins's restaurants, designed to make fast food even faster, offer stand-up counters but no indoor seating; some have seats outdoors. They also were the chain's first to have two drive-in windows in a single restaurant.</p>
        <p>Most are decorated with bright cherry red and silver metallic accents, and feature huge portraits of Mr. Hawkins, who is something of a folk hero in the inner cities where he operates. Customers are treated to thumping hip hop and Motown music, inside and out. In tougher areas,  the Nation of Islam provides security men, some in bow ties and suits.</p>
        <p>But Burger King contends that his glamorous touches only disguised an inability to pay bills. ''When we were beginning to have conversations about him being very undercapitalized, he went, without any advance warning to Burger King, and put his capital and resources into Pizza Huts,'' Mr. Blum said. ''For much of 1998 and 1999, the only way we received any royalty and advertising payments from him was by loaning him the money to pay us.''</p>
        <p>BESIDES that, Mr. Blum said, Burger King guaranteed $8 million in secured loans to Mr. Hawkins through a special financing program and leased Mr. Hawkins 13 of his stores, a less-profitable practice the company had  backed away from. ''We have invested in Mr. Hawkins's business far in excess of what we've done for our other franchisees,'' Mr. Blum said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hawkins says he suspended royalty and loan payments temporarily, and only because Burger King was slow to identify restaurants he could buy or to approve his requests to locate new ones. ''We were supposed to have 35 stores at the end of 1998 and 70 stores by the end of 1999,'' Mr. Hawkins said. ''What was the point in throwing good money after bad, when it was clear Burger King wasn't keeping its promise?''</p>
        <p>He also blames the feud for a series of lawsuits filed against him in 1996 and 1997 by disgruntled food and supply vendors who said he had failed to pay them. The suits ranged from $31,000 to $1.4 million and are still being resolved.</p>
        <p>While his own lawsuit, seeking $500 million, winds through court, Mr. Hawkins is completing his next deal: the acquisition of 60 to 125 family-style restaurants from a chain that he says he will identify this summer.</p>
        <p>Whatever happens between him and Burger King, Mr. Hawkins said, the minority residents of urban America will always have an appetite for his brand of business. ''I've proven I know how to create jobs and opportunities for them,'' he said. ''They trust me.''</p>
