        <p>NEIGHBORS call it the Tuckahoe Swamp, but the name for the 102 acres of woods and wetlands near Bullhead Bay in Southampton changes to West Neck Hills on subdivision plans that the owner, Charles S. Holmes, has filed with the town.</p>
        <p>It is, said Lucius Ware, one of the neighbors and the president of the Eastern Long Island branch of the N.A.A.C.P., a ''deceptive misnomer'' for a flora- and fauna-rich land mostly at or below sea level, where fresh water drains to the bay and into the Peconic estuary.</p>
        <p>What would be better, Mr. Ware said at a recent news conference held by diverse groups pressing the town to move aggressively to buy the land, would be the Charles S. Holmes Swamp Preserve, in honor of the owner if he agreed to scrap plans for a 28-lot subdivision and sold the town a holding almost everyone agrees is too environmentally important to be cut up for roads and houses.</p>
        <p>By whatever name, the 102 primordial acres, one of the largest undeveloped, privately owned parcels remaining in the town and on all of Long Island, is at the center of preservation efforts in Southampton, where new housing -- much of it for second-home buyers and priced beyond the range of local residents -- continues to swiftly transform the Hamptons landscape.</p>
        <p>Last month the town board, reversing an earlier position, rejected a plan to extend the Long Island pine barrens preserve to eastern parts of the town, saying it would take steps of its own. The preserve would have blocked or limited development in core areas that would have included woods and watersheds like the West Neck Hills property.</p>
        <p>Organizers of the new coalition, which includes the Group for the South Fork, the Shinnecock Land Defense Committee, the N.A.A.C.P. branch, students at Southampton College, neighbors and some local business owners, said that while town officials continued to talk about  preservation efforts of their own, money that local voters had approved for the purpose was not being spent as critical time was lost.</p>
        <p>And the town planning board, they said, continued to approve and, in their view, expedite development on parcels the town board and the town's new master plan earmarked for acquisition or other protection.</p>
        <p>Especially egregious, the groups said, was the planning board's preliminary decision to issue a ''negative declaration'' under the state's Environmental Quality Review Act -- meaning no full-fledged environmental study of potential negative impacts of the West Neck Hills development would be required -- and its apparent intention to accept a subdivision map that impinged on wetland areas identified by the town's own environmental staff.</p>
        <p>Also galling, they said, was the snail's pace of land preservation despite money set aside for it.</p>
        <p>''This place is rapidly becoming something it wasn't even five years ago,'' said Robert S. DeLuca, the president of the Group for the South Fork, an environmental organization in Bridgehampton. ''The people out here realize that, and they have taxed themselves many times to preserve open space. Now we want to see the money that we have all put aside converted into real preservation while there is still something left to preserve.''</p>
        <p>The town supervisor, Vincent J. Cannuscio, said that far from being inactive, he was leading acquisition efforts for the West Hills parcel. Last month, the town board also imposed a six-month moratorium on the processing of development applications, temporarily halting action on West Hills and dozens of other projects.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cannuscio said he had written to Mr. Holmes in New Jersey and to the owner's local lawyer, David J. Gilmartin of Southampton, to propose that the town appraise the land for possible acquisition, but had not gotten a reply.</p>
        <p>''All I am asking for is a simple sit-down,'' said Mr. Cannuscio, who held a news conference to announce the overture. ''The town has the money, and I believe there is a way that Mr. Holmes, the town and the community can become partners in preserving it.''</p>
        <p>The money, $10 million in a community preservation fund to buy environmentally significant land from willing sellers, is itself a measure of development in the town. It was raised by a voter-approved 2 percent real estate transfer tax that has produced $15 million since taking effect in April 1999.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cannuscio's letter to Mr. Holmes, dated April 5, was addressed to Holmes Asset Management in Rutherford, N.J., for which no telephone number is listed. Mr. Holmes owns a home and other acreage near the Southampton parcel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gilmartin said last week that he had received the supervisor's letter. But, he said, ''As far as I know the subdivision is proceeding, and at the moment I don't know if Mr. Holmes wishes to sell the property.''</p>
        <p>Meantime, Mr. Cannuscio's efforts have been called too timid. While his letter to Mr. Holmes emphasized the town's interest in acquiring the property for full market value, they said, Mr. Cannuscio was too much a supplicant in asking Mr. Holmes to ''please consider this letter as a friendly invite to consider a possible transaction.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cannuscio bristled at the criticism. ''In pushing their causes, the environmental extremists have to create demons,'' he said. ''There are those who would push all the buttons of government in a very offensive way, and that is not my style.''</p>
        <p>He said he was also contacting owners of other land the town would like to acquire, but would proceed only in cases where the owners expressed an interest in selling. He said the town had spent $7 million on land preservation in the past year.</p>
        <p>But as the town board and planning board officials have received stacks of letters opposing the West Neck Hills project and imploring town action to preserve the land, pressure to proceed has increased.</p>
        <p>The chairman of the six-member appointed town planning board, Dennis Finnerty, and the board's vice chairman, the home builder James V. Zizzi, said they were required by law to process the West Hills subdivision application without unreasonable delay and could not take into account the town board's efforts to preserve it.</p>
        <p>''We don't have the power to deny projects based on general community opposition,'' Mr. Finnerty said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Finnerty added, ''There is no other parcel in the town that is more deserving of preservation.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Zizzi, the former president and chairman of the Long Island Builders Institute, agreed that the West Hills land was ''obviously an environmentally sensitive piece of property'' but that town efforts to buy it ''cannot come into our deliberations.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Cannuscio said that while the planning board members were ''aware of my position'' on West Neck Hills, ''they act on their own.''</p>
        <p>But Carolyn Zenk, an environmental lawyer elected to the town board in November, said the town board was ''responsible to send a message to the planning board and let them know we are the policy makers, we are in the bully pulpit.''</p>
        <p>''These are some of the last open spaces in the metropolitan area,'' she said. ''There is hardly anything else left.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Finnerty and Mr. Zizzi defended the planning board's preliminary finding that no environmental impact statement would be required for the West Neck Hills development. ''If there is new information we can revoke it,'' Mr. Zizzi said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Finnerty said extensive litigation involving the property had provided reams of environmental information. The litigation, between Mr. Holmes and the planning board involving the wetlands boundaries, began after Mr. Holmes first proposed a subdivision in the early 1990's, officials said.</p>
        <p>Steven Biasetti, an environmental analyst for the Group for the South Fork, said the environmental sensitivity of the land and the still unexplored negative impacts of development clearly required an environmental study. ''They are rewriting the Environmental Quality Review Act,'' he said. ''We are asking that they at least play by the rules.''</p>
        <p>As the new coalition tries to build more support, it will have support from the Shinnecock Tribe, whose members were deeply offended by town approval for a housing development called Parish Ponds on ancestral lands near the Shinnecock reservation in Southampton. The West Hills property is in the same vicinity.</p>
        <p>''They will be digging basements and there they will find the bones of our ancestors,'' said Elizabeth Thunder Bird Haile, a tribe member, referring to building at Parish Ponds. ''The bones will be disturbed. We don't go around disturbing other people's cemeteries.''</p>
        <p>''After 350 years we are rising up, but not the way our ancestors are,'' she said. ''They have their own way of rising up and telling their story. If I tell you you should not develop this land, I have a number of reasons.''</p>
