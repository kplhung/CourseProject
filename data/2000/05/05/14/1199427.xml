        <p>Some trembled with emotion as they recounted horror stories about apartment-snatching real estate brokers. Others voiced support for small-property owners who could now afford to send their children to college, thanks to soaring local rents.</p>
        <p>They were among nearly 200 Park Slope residents who packed a forum entitled ''The Gentrification of Park Slope'' Thursday night at Public School 321 on Seventh Avenue to discuss the pros and cons of the neighborhood's increasing prosperity. The panel included a community leader, an urban sociologist, a real estate agent and a property owner.</p>
        <p>The issue, panelists said, revolves around balancing free market forces with the economic and ethnic heterogeneity that many residents say first attracted them to the area.</p>
        <p>''Can we find ways to honor the values of our neighborhood -- diversity, affordability and long-term residents -- even when they conflict with many of our interests?'' asked Brad Lander, executive director of the Fifth Avenue Committee. ''Do we want the person paying $600 or $700 a month to be able to continue to live where their families have lived for years, even when the market forces raise that apartment to $1,500 to $1,800?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lander said his committee has recommended a voluntary ''displacement-free zone'' for blocks where lower-income families are in danger of being evicted in favor of tenants who can pay twice or three times as much rent.</p>
        <p>But Roger Melzer, a panelist who is a property owner and a board member of a neighborhood revitalization group, countered by saying, ''I'm happy to be enjoying the benefits of what's happening in the real estate market, and I'm not ashamed of that.''</p>
        <p>Sharon Zukin, a professor of sociology at Brooklyn College and the City University of New York, said market forces could only be resisted through political action. Marc Gerstein, president of Warren Lewis Realty, suggested that the way to preserve diversity in high-priced areas is to improve education and give everyone the opportunity to earn high incomes.</p>
        <p>Some audience members said real estate brokers were to blame for escalating housing prices. Sheree Lane angrily described how, after she had signed a contract to buy a co-op she had been renting and then applied for board approval, a real-estate broker on the board persuaded the seller to hold out for more money. ''Co-ops should not operate as real estate cartels,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Carl Giangrande, a property owner, said he hoped the high real estate values would spread gentrification into surrounding areas.</p>
        <p>''I look forward to the day we'll have this discussion in East New York,'' he said.</p>
