        <p>MILLENARIANS, mark your calendars. Wednesday, May 17, may be the last chance for the destruction of planet Earth.</p>
        <p>Let's face it. Y2K was a bust. For all the headaches caused by computers choking on the double zeros of the new century, civilization remained stubbornly intact. The millennial leap year on Feb. 29 was also supposed to create computer havoc. But that too was a disappointment, as was May 5, when Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn lined up with the Moon and Sun, promising, for the scientifically impaired, calamitous gravitational effects on Earth.</p>
        <p>With the Year 2000 almost half over, the opportunities for a millennial end time are narrowing. In fact, the last big chance may come this Wednesday, when there will be another planetary alignment. This time the Sun and five planets (but not the Moon) will form an even tighter grouping than they did earlier in the month.</p>
        <p>If anything calamitous does happen, it will not be explainable by physics. For one thing these alignments are far from exact: next week's is really a clustering within a 19-degree arc of the sky. But even a perfect alignment would be no cause for alarm. Gravity weakens so rapidly with distance that the tug exerted on Earth by all nine planets is vastly less than that of the Moon. And in this month's celestial events, the planets are lining up on the far side of the sun.</p>
        <p>''With the planets on the opposite side of the Sun,'' reassured a NASA Web site (nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/  planetary/alignment.html), ''the force from each body will actually be at its absolute minimum.'' And with the Sun in the way, astronomers will not even be treated to a good celestial show.</p>
        <p>The real action is not in the sky but on the Internet, where a smattering of sites are devoted to the astrological, biblical and monetary possibilities of the nonevent.</p>
        <p>A business called the Survival Center has a Web page, ''Earth Changes Update'' (www.zyz.com/  survivalcenter/echange.html), that warns of earthquakes, tidal waves and winds as intense as 2,000 miles per hour -- perfect conditions for hawking its supply of gasoline generators, solar radios and six-day candles. The site also sells a book titled ''5/5/2000 Ice: The Ultimate Disaster,'' in which the author, Richard Noone, predicted that the alignment would cause the poles to melt, unleashing a flood of Noachian proportions.</p>
        <p>All this may sound familiar to those who remember ''The Jupiter Effect,'' a 1974 book in which two scientists, John R. Gribbin and Stephen Plagemann, forecast that a planetary alignment in 1982 would upset the Sun, setting off a complex chain of events that would result in a devastating California earthquake. ''There is no question about the implication,'' the authors wrote, evoking the hit tune ''Age of Aquarius'': ''In 1982 'when the Moon is in the Seventh House, and Jupiter aligns with Mars' and with the other seven planets of the Solar System, Los Angeles will be destroyed.''</p>
        <p>The book was followed by a sequel: ''The Jupiter Effect Reconsidered.''</p>
