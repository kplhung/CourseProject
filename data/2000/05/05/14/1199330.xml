        <p>From the description, the luxury rental building that AvalonBay  Communities is to begin constructing in the fall as part of the Queens West waterfront project sounds as though it could just as easily be plunked down in Miami or California as in Long Island City.</p>
        <p>The building, to be called Avalon Riverview, will offer such amenities as a 20,000-square-foot landscaped courtyard with putting green, a club room for parties, exercise rooms with cardiovascular and weight machines, and a business center with computers, photocopy and fax machines.</p>
        <p>When completed in the fall of 2002, it will be the first of three apartment buildings that are to be put up by AvalonBay, a real estate investment trust that specializes in residential rental projects. It will also be the second structure to go up on the 74-acre Queens West residential and commercial development, directly across the East River from the United Nations.</p>
        <p>Avalon Riverview will be next to the existing Citylights, a 42-story co-op developed by the Trotwood Corporation. On the same base as the rental tower will be a separate 75-apartment building for the elderly financed by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development.</p>
        <p>When it is completed, Queens West, which is rising on city-  and state-owned land, is expected to have 19 development parcels, with a projected 6.4 million square feet of residential space, 2.4 million square feet of office and hotel space, 225,000 square feet of retail space and 115,000 square feet of public facilities.</p>
        <p>The first AvalonBay building will have 372 units, 10 percent of them studios, 50 percent one-bedrooms, 32 percent two-bedrooms and 8 percent three-bedrooms, some of which will be duplexes. The architect is Perkins Eastman.</p>
        <p>Although rental prices will not be set until the building nears completion, Tracey Applebaum, senior development director for AvalonBay, said that ''we expect rents to be about $36 a square foot'' a year. ''That is a significant discount compared to Manhattan pricing, which is now $50 a square foot,'' she said. At $36 per square foot, rents for one-bedrooms, for example, which are to range from 700 to 1,100 square feet, would be from $2,100 to $3,300 a month.</p>
        <p>Though ''these are technically quite expensive,'' she said, ''we believe there is a large population being squeezed out of Manhattan,  people with good high-paying jobs who simply can't afford the city.''</p>
        <p>Construction costs are estimated at $100 million.</p>
