        <p>I AM probably the only recent visitor to Nashville who did not come for the music. Instead, my focus was the newly energized dining scene in this melodic city of impassioned hopes and unfulfilled dreams.</p>
        <p>Fine dining has been slow to take root here. Most of the growth has been among creative casual restaurants, something that barely existed five years ago. So for the first time, musical pilgrims can find a respectable crop of dining spots.</p>
        <p>A few observations about Nashville restaurants. They are incredibly inexpensive, with few entrees over $20, and at lunch half that; service, however, has not kept  pace with the food, so be patient; lastly, portions are colossal, which may explain why some of these musical cowboys are busting out of their rhinestone-studded shirts.</p>
        <p>Capitol Grille</p>
        <p>If Nashville has the equivalent of New York's ''21'' Club it is the Capitol Grille, a warm and woody lair in the refurbished Hermitage hotel, in the heart of the downtown business district. But in contrast to the former's flawless service, Capitol Grille's, at least when I lunched there, is slower than a cowboy ballad. That aside, you can have an agreeable leisurely lunch or, in the late afternoon, take part in a Dixie happy hour in the splendid old bar.</p>
        <p>The Capitol Grille allows confidential business conversation with its well-distanced tables, vaulted ceiling and sound-muting rugs. The food could be described as elbows-on-the-table Southern with a few carpetbagging nouvelle twists: spinach salad with ham-hock vinaigrette, flank steak with fried cheese grits, chicken tempura and the like.</p>
        <p>For some reason many Nashville restaurants have a thing about butter. In three of the places I visited, diners are given some sort of blended dried-bean condiment along with the bread. At Capitol Grille, where diners also get big fans of Indian papadum, the healthful spread -- a blend of mashed split peas, lemon and thyme -- is quite good. Diners are not given the option of having butter -- as in a speakeasy, if you want the real stuff you have to ask.</p>
        <p>Must have something to do with those tight country western jeans.</p>
        <p>For starters I tried the peppery cornmeal-crusted shrimp with a sweet tomato chutney, a felicitous match. And out of curiosity I investigated one Asian appetizer, a red-curry-stoked chicken tempura that was moist, light and brittle, and served with a fiery ginger jalapeno dip.</p>
        <p>Nashville chefs have a sweet tooth, especially with seafood. A rosy, faintly sweet pecan-crusted salmon was paired with braised greens that were oddly sugary, along with orange slices and jasmine rice.</p>
        <p>Seared rock shrimp did not suffer from the sweets, but they were blown off of the plate by a dense pork sausage that was smokier than backstage at a honky-tonk.</p>
        <p>For dessert, the custardy bread pudding is a winner, as is the crunchy macadamia tart with cappuccino ice cream. Capitol Grille's wine list is small, conventional and on the pricey side.</p>
        <p>Bound'ry</p>
        <p>One of the best restaurants in Nashville, Bound'ry is a platter of contradictions. It is both new-age ethereal -- the menu cover oozes: ''Allow us to paint a global picture for your palate'' -- and culinarily refined, and it has the ambience of Daytona Beach on the last night of spring break.</p>
        <p>This multilevel, pseudo-Roman fun house near Vanderbilt University is done in crazy Southwestern colors, with grotesque gnarly sculptures projecting from the walls. It is the kind of dimly lighted, labyrinthine place where you wouldn't want to seek out the rest rooms, especially after a few drinks, for fear of never finding your way back.</p>
        <p>On a Saturday night we waited about 40 minutes for a table (reservations are limited to an early seating on weekends), as the place was packed; yet, impressively, the service staff was composed, friendly and highly professional. While waiting we ordered from the slightly expensive wine list a tart, fresh Mondavi fume blanc ($33). The list is organized by characteristics: ''effervescent starters,'' ''complex whites,'' ''polished, structured reds'' (whatever they are). More noteworthy is the enormous global beer selection, which includes ''flight'' tastings of four beers for $5.50.</p>
        <p>It takes a while to hack through  the thicket of menu verbiage, but chances are you will be happy at the end. I started with the phyllo-and-pistachio-wrapped baked shrimp with three zippy dipping sauces: chipotle ketchup, honey mustard aioli and ''Virginia ketchup'' (as opposed to Nebraska ketchup?). A trio of small fish tastings included a moist, lightly smoked trout cake, a tasty peanut-crusted mahi mahi, and spicy crab in wonton wrappers along with a good smoked corn remoulade. I couldn't resist the ''Southwestern sushi'' -- so outlandish it could frighten Japanese children: a chipotle-spiced tortilla wrapped around a melange of smoked salmon, spicy rice, and mixed vegetables, It was delicious.</p>
        <p>For entrees there was a rosy duck breast with a Thai dipping sauce, along with a terrific ginger-scallion-potato cake. Desserts disappeared fast at my table, especially the roulade of genoise filled with a lemony chiffon and sliced fruits.</p>
        <p>Zola</p>
        <p>I thought that Bound'ry had a long-winded menu until I went to Zola, a charming and ambitious restaurant near the center of town. Try reciting this in one breath: warm spinach and beet salad with roasted beets, apple-smoked bacon, pumpkin seeds, crystallized ginger, spicy cranberries, sesame yogurt, horseradish fries, raspberry apple vinaigrette.</p>
        <p>''I really like this,'' said one of the discriminating diners at my table.</p>
        <p>''You're putting me on,'' I replied, reaching over for a taste.</p>
        <p>As improbable as it sounds, this leafy rumble on a plate was delightful, amazingly balanced. Another satisfying ''provocation'' (their term for appetizer) was lamb-pistachio dumplings with a pumpkin harissa yogurt and an apple-ginger broth.</p>
        <p>Debra Paquette, the chef-owner, turns out some complex though harmonious entrees: grilled venison with a red grape gravy, pear-pistachio chutney, and a sweet potato falafel; a corn-liquor-cured pork chop (a bit overcooked) with faintly sweet red grape gravy; and grilled halibut drizzled with truffle oil and served with black olive croutons, and grilled vegetables, olives, capers, red onions . . . You get the picture.</p>
        <p>Our charming and diligent waitress had memorized all of these dishes, a feat similar to naming every wine produced in France and Italy. Speaking of wine, Zola's wide-ranging list is well paired with the food and fairly priced.</p>
        <p>Even though I have vowed never to eat creme brulee again, this highly touted one, with a passion-fruit crust, was a sprightly variation. Also ask for some of the Moroccan spiced ice cream -- vanilla with cinnamon, cayenne, cardamom, nutmeg, pepper and cloves. Wild, to be sure, but subtle enough to create a delightful Indian-style flavor with a slight afterburn from the cayenne.</p>
        <p>Sasso</p>
        <p>In recent years the slowly gentrifying East Nashville neighborhood has seen some promising new restaurants. Perhaps the most compelling is Sasso, just over a year old. I was certain that a waiter was playing a practical joke when he described the menu as a surreal blend of Southwestern, Asian, Cajun and New Southern cuisines.</p>
        <p>The exterior of this old clapboard building belies a modish dining room with a midnight blue industrial ceiling, black-and-white tiled floors, and lazy overhead fans.</p>
        <p>I started my world tour with delicate gyoza -- shrimp dumpling with a spicy Thai-style dipping sauce, and crispy scallop spring rolls flanked by earthy black bean sauce. Also good was peppery seared tuna with a brassy wasabi-creme fraiche dip.</p>
        <p>Servers here were knowledgeable and endlessly patient. Also helpful was the zealous sommelier. His list is small but well conceived for this multifaceted food, and priced fairly. One of his recommendations was a New Zealand white called Te Kairanga, which is sharp and lively with strong grapefruit overtones.</p>
        <p>The best main courses were the Szechuan style peanut-crusted salmon, served over crispy noodles and stir-fried bok choy, and pork loin marinated in a chipotle-infused oil rolled in cumin seeds -- lusty and slightly overcooked.</p>
        <p>Another flavorful dish was ''fiery spiced bass'' with dirty rice and a well-seasoned crawfish etoufee.</p>
        <p>Desserts include a dense, rich brownie with cappuccino ice cream and an apple cobbler enlivened with ginger and orange zest, topped with buttermilk creme fraiche ice cream.</p>
        <p>Sunset Grill</p>
        <p>Nashville is a fairly busy lunch town, perhaps because most musicians wake up around noon and consider it breakfast. Sunset Grill, a sleek, glass-fronted spot convenient to downtown, is particularly popular.</p>
        <p>The ''sunset'' here is not particularly romantic, however, what with a parking lot on one side and Domino's Pizza on the other.</p>
        <p>One peculiar practice of Nashville restaurants is that they often eschew the term ''appetizer.'' Instead they call them things like ''inspirations,'' ''proprieties,'' ''welcomings.'' My first inspiration was a quesadilla of moist smoky duck flanked by a good salsa of mango, black beans, and pineapple, with a dollop of cilantro sour cream. Less compelling was a flat Caesar salad that lacked advertised sun-dried tomatoes and toasted pine nuts. Among entrees you would do well with the moist and fresh blue-crab-and-rock-shrimp cakes along with a colorful vegetable escabeche and chili mayonnaise.</p>
        <p>Our flummoxed waiter was almost comically inept, botching virtually everything from taking orders to miscalculating the check -- I hope this was an isolated incident. And I dared not order wine for fear of receiving a pina colada.</p>
        <p>Hands down, the best dish was the butterscotch-habanero bread pudding, a rich one-two punch. Happily, they don't call it ''Frivolous Finales'' or ''Last Train to Nashville.'' Just dessert.</p>
