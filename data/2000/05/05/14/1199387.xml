        <p>Just how solid is New Roc City? The question arose last week as the parent company of a large tenant in the complex, the Sports Plus entertainment center, filed for bankruptcy. But officials of Sports Plus and New Roc City say the Chapter 11 filing of Sports Plus's parent company, Family Golf Centers, does not threaten the future of the center. Joseph V. Apicella, a New Roc City senior vice president, said the bankruptcy would allow Family Golf to regroup and would have no impact on New Roc City. ''They're one of our highest-yielding locations,'' he said. ''We have every confidence that they're here for the long haul.'' Sports Plus runs two ice rinks and a video arcade in the 138,000 square feet of space it rents in New Roc City, which opened last fall on the site of the former New Rochelle Mall.</p>
