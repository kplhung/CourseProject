        <p>The opinion essay by Jim Panos [''Stretching Limits of Free Speech,'' May 7] made my blood run cold. Apparently Mr. Panos would dearly like to rewrite the Constitution, in particular those annoying First and Second Amendments. While you are at it, Jim, why not get rid of that pesky Fourth Amendment, which prevents your home from being searched without a warrant. And since we have the sword drawn, why not get rid of the Fifth Amendment? Why should you not incriminate yourself?</p>
        <p>The views of Mr. Panos seem to have more in common with dictatorship than democracy.</p>
