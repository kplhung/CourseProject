        <p>THE illusion -- or is it delusion? -- of historical  re-creation onstage is being addressed with a number of wise words and deeds. In Rameau's ''Platee'' at the New York City Opera and Carlo Gozzi's ''Green Bird'' at the Cort Theater, 18th-century theater enters into heavy negotiation with the present.</p>
        <p>Then there is Jonathan Miller, the English director, writing in The New York Review of Books and explaining, among other things, why Debussy's ''Pelleas et Melisande'' is perhaps happier in the land of Proust than in some medieval ur-German forest of misty place and date. The Metropolitan Opera, meanwhile, has labored on with its 13-year-old production of Wagner's ''Ring,'' splendidly sung and played, and couched, to the consternation of many, in a misty photo-realism all its own.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Miller rightly points out, music survives history more easily than stagecraft does. Theater, dealing with people's lives, catalogs the events around them, the streets they walk on, the clothes on their backs and the furniture they sit on. Even when we reconstruct the facts and the artifacts, the chemistry that binds all these things together is lost. Shelf life has expired; the ingredients have become inert.</p>
        <p>Music is more primal, more specific than the day to day. Music is not about what happens to people but about their states of mind and heart when it is happening. Morals change. Standards of conduct change. Characters ride horses or drive trucks. But I suspect that the visceral rushes of pain and pleasure stay pretty much the same, as constituent parts of an emotional DNA that survives in a straight line from Adam and Eve to Elvis Presley.</p>
        <p>First ''Platee,'' elegantly staged and clothed by the Mark Morris Dance Group and Isaac Mizrahi, and then ''The Green Bird,'' marvelously reimagined by Julie Taymor, have an advantage over social melodrama (''La Boheme'') or political activism (''The Marriage of Figaro''). Rameau's gods and goddesses and Gozzi's stylized physical comedians and magic tricks occupy made-up worlds where realism is in the eyes of beholders, be they Baroque or space-age. Because everything is imaginary, the room to maneuver widens.</p>
        <p>If Ms. Taymor's Truffaldino and Smeraldina had lived in Gozzi's Rome, I suspect they would have been very like the Brooklyn sausage vendors she has made of them. Comedy is by nature topical. The topics change in 250 years, so the comedy must, too. One of the minor tragedies for opera today is Mozart's ''Abduction From the Seraglio,'' which is filled with glorious music and lamed by period humor that seems inextricable from the plot and simply isn't funny anymore.</p>
        <p>The principles of exaggeration and absurdity endure, but comedy must be made exaggerated and absurd for a whole new set of people. The Marx Brothers are our commedia dell'arte. The accents change, and the wisecrack is introduced. The racetrack, the ocean liner and the college campus become the streets of Rome or the Italian countryside. But exchanging one set of props for another is not as easy as it sounds. Required is not the literal equation but an instinctive knack, a sense of taste and judgment that an enterprise has or hasn't. We can be thankful that Ms. Taymor has it all the time, and Mr. Morris and Mr. Mizrahi almost always.</p>
        <p>What helps both Rameau and Gozzi toward 21st-century success are the blurrings between old and new. The Shakespearean diction of Ms. Taymor's King (Derek Smith) tunes into and out of neurotic Upper East Side New Yorkese. The pear-shaped vowels of Brighella (Reg E. Cathey) lapse happily into Jamaican street slang. Mr. Morris's dancers whirl balletically one moment and take the disco floor the next. In both events, old and new are thrown into the same pot and made to swim together. It is an excellent idea, this sweet-and-sour mix; the recipe sounds easy, too, but the doing is again dependent on the taste and judgment of whoever is doing the throwing.</p>
        <p>The obstacle to most updates of old stage pieces is the simile, or if you like, the metaphor. The 18th century is reborn in 21st-century form, and you are invited to see how the details match up. But three is a crowd. Simile descends on words and music like a mother-in-law on a newlywed's household. That Susanna's servant quarters are like a maid's room in Trump Tower or that Wotan and company are Ruhr Valley industrialists makes interesting sociological fodder, but it gets in the way.</p>
        <p>A retailer has been interposed between theatrical message and audience reception. To pass from one to the other now requires a translation. The listener must stop and think, ''This really means that.'' In ''Figaro,'' Mozart wants Susanna to go straight to your heart. The update insists first that you get the joke it is making. Make the metaphor as cunning as you will -- line up 18th with 21st century precisely -- and still the added transaction deflects the concentration.</p>
        <p>''Pelleas'' has an easier time, but for another reason. The opera's methodology is imprecision itself, leaving the facts to fade and the heart and mind behind the facts to take precedence. Maeterlinck's characters wander like sleepwalkers. They (and often the audience) have only vague ideas of where they have come from or what their destination will be. If the Met ''Ring'' sees ancient castles and murky forests through Wagner's 19th-century eyes, Mr. Miller's production hears in Debussy's music the exquisite melancholy and discreet repression of the composer's own France. Both ways lay claim to authenticity.</p>
