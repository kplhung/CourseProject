        <p>It was on this date in 1965 that the F.B.I. delivered to the White House information about me from ''an extremely sensitive source'' suggesting that it might ''be of interest'' to President Lyndon Johnson.

        <p>The fact of that White House transmittal is the only comprehensible and legibly dated news I could glean from 41 heavily excised pages sent to me in alleged compliance with the Freedom of Information Act. It was seven years ago that I invoked that act to see my F.B.I. file, which had long been kept secret. I expected a full dossier covering my years as a reporter in Moscow, Havana and Washington, with particularly rich entries for the year 1965, when I annoyed the authorities with articles about America's covert intervention in the Dominican Republic and about escalation of the war in Vietnam.</p>
        <p>A part of my file -- apparently the portion that focused on efforts to track down some of my 1965 sources -- was finally censored into incoherence and ''declassified'' on Oct. 6, 1998. Even then, it was not mailed until 18 months later, on March 30, 2000. And the mailing suggested that there were many ''additional references'' in the files that ''may pertain'' to me. I was told I could request them, whereupon they would presumably be similarly blacked out and sent to me in the year 2007.</p>
        <p>I offer this amusing but sad evidence of government waste and corruption because it is emblematic of how federal and most state and local officials have sabotaged one of the hard-won freedoms achieved by Americans and their media a generation ago: the right, with only sensible exceptions, to find out what our government does, knows and records.</p>
        <p>Federal agents and county sheriffs alike now routinely frustrate the law by invoking phony ''security'' concerns to keep their files secret even decades after any conceivable risk has disappeared. When that dodge fails, they can refuse information to avoid ''unwarranted invasion of personal privacy,'' even if it is my privacy that was obviously breached. And when no pretext can justify withholding information, governments have learned to play the actuarial odds, stalling inquiries for months and even years until all interest in, and value of, their records have expired.</p>
        <p>Reporters once thought that they, as surrogates for the public, would be the main beneficiaries of freedom-of-information laws. With timely access to hearings and records, they hoped for more effective monitoring of official behavior and investigations of chronic injustice. But officialdom has learned to frustrate the media with refusals that can be challenged with only costly time-consuming litigation. It recently took a court hearing and three months for a Columbia journalism student to gain admission to New York City's administrative ''taxi court,'' and he had what most reporters lack: time and legal training. The New York Police Department routinely deflects inquiries for four months and dares the media to invest in full-scale litigation. The Times had to go all the way to the Court of Appeals last year to gain access to the performance records of doctors in New York hospitals.</p>
        <p>As Adam Liptak, The Times's senior counsel, who handles the paper's freedom-of-information actions, has observed, and as the surveys of many newspapers around the country have confirmed, most government agencies know how to work the system to frustrate unwelcome inquiries. There is only one ''wonderland,'' Liptak reports, where officials take the law seriously and usually respond positively in 24 hours: the state of Florida. The reason is that Florida law guarantees an immediate, next-morning judicial review of rejections and automatic payment of attorney fees if the state loses. Bureaucrats wanting to withhold a piece of information must seek specific legislation, says Pat Gleason, general counsel to Florida's attorney general. And as Congress and other states might note, Florida has sunnily survived its nakedness.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, even the crudest censorship sometimes slips and fails to conceal damaging evidence of official stupidity. Thus it was that I learned from one clear line in a memo that the F.B.I. had to consult the Congressional Directory to discover that I worked for The Times and that censored ''indices'' showed that I often wrote about European affairs! And that ''sensitive'' letter to the White House concluded with an oddly self-effacing explanation that ''all correspondents of The New York Times are treated with circumspection by the Bureau and our relationship with The New York Times is strained.'' Heads should roll for clearing that confession of respect.</p>
