        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Deregulation Has Given Power to the Power People'' (April 30), which looked at the improved financial outlook of utilities:</p>
        <p>Deregulation has given utilities an unprecedented multibillion-dollar  bailout at the expense of consumers and a vibrant competitive market.</p>
        <p>But states that are still deregulating can help remedy the situation. They must mandate full divestiture of utility generation assets before considering proposals to let utilities recover so-called stranded costs -- those for plants, primarily nuclear, that could not pay for themselves under deregulation. And use of state-backed bonds to lock in recovery  must be banned. States that have already deregulated must revisit the stranded-cost issue by adjusting or throwing out transition charges, based on utilities' new, rosier financial picture.</p>
        <p>CHRISTOPHER SHERRY  Washington, May 2</p>
        <p>The writer is research director of the Safe Energy Communication Council, a coalition of national environmental and consumer groups.</p>
