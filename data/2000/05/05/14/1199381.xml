        <p>The Mamaroneck Village Board has postponed action on awarding a contract to build and run a sports complex at Harbor Island Park, after village residents complained at a meeting last Monday that the board had failed to tell them of plans to award the contract to a Long Island company called Sportime. Currently, the park's eight clay tennis courts are open to the public from May to October. The rest of the year the courts are leased to the Harbor View Racquet Club. Mayor Deborah Chapin said the village was losing money on the courts. Under the proposed contract, Sportime would replace the courts and build and operate a multisport complex, spending an estimated $1.9 million and paying the village $4.5 million over the 17-year life of the contract. By law, the board can award such a contract without public hearings. But most residents at the meeting agreed with Richard L. Ottinger, the former Congressman, who said, ''You may have the right, but it's wrong.'' The Village Board will take up the matter again on May 22 at 7 p.m. at the Emelin Theater.</p>
