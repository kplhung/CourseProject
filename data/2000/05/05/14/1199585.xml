        <p>The Eastern Conference finals between the Devils and the Flyers that will start Sunday afternoon in Philadelphia will be decided on physical strength, goaltending and special teams, with the special teams perhaps the key factor in the four-of-seven-game series.</p>
        <p>While the Flyers have been the most effective team in the Stanley Cup playoffs with the man advantage, the Devils have been the most efficient at killing penalties. They extinguished all 20 Toronto power plays in the conference semifinals and have allowed just one goal in 34 power plays in the playoffs for a remarkable 97.1 percent efficiency. The only power-play goal the Devils allowed was to Florida's Pavel Bure in the fourth game of the first-round sweep of the Panthers.</p>

        <p>The Eastern Conference finals between the Devils and the Flyers that will start Sunday afternoon in Philadelphia will be decided on physical strength, goaltending and special teams, with the special teams perhaps the key factor in the four-of-seven-game series.</p>
        <p>While the Flyers have been the most effective team in the Stanley Cup playoffs with the man advantage, the Devils have been the most efficient at killing penalties. They extinguished all 20 Toronto power plays in the conference semifinals and have allowed just one goal in 34 power plays in the playoffs for a remarkable 97.1 percent efficiency. The only power-play goal the Devils allowed was to Florida's Pavel Bure in the fourth game of the first-round sweep of the Panthers.</p>
        <p>Even though they have had such remarkable success thwarting the opposition with the man advantage, avoiding penalties against the Flyers is a priority for the Devils. With John LeClair and Mark Recchi leading the way, the Flyers have been deadly on the power play.</p>
        <p>''Penalties is a no-no for us,'' Bobby Holik said after this afternoon's practice before the Devils traveled to Philadelphia. ''They're too dangerous on the power play, and we don't want to put ourselves in that situation.''</p>
        <p>The Flyers have scored 13 goals in 52 chances (25 percent) with the man advantage for almost half of their total playoff goal production of 29. LeClair leads the team with four power-play goals, while Recchi and the rookie Simon Gagne are next with two each.</p>
        <p>LeClair leads the Flyers with six goals in the playoffs, and his 10 points are second to Recchi, who has three goals and nine assists for 12 points. Recchi plays the point on the power play, and his quarterbacking ability has been a key to its success.</p>
        <p>''These guys are good hockey players,'' Devils defenseman Scott Stevens said.</p>
        <p>''We have to play them tough because they capitalize on their opportunities,'' said Stevens, who will be paired with the rookie Brian Rafalski against Philadelphia's top line.</p>
        <p>Stevens was the best player in the first two rounds for the Devils. He said he was looking forward to the series with the Flyers ''because they are more of a rivalry'' than Toronto and Florida. ''It's almost like the Rangers,'' Stevens said, ''and, personally, I go back a long way against them when I was in Washington.''</p>
        <p>Stevens and the Devils have lost just once in their last eight games to the Flyers. They beat Philadelphia four of the five times the teams met in the regular season, but only once since Brian Boucher, the rookie sensation, became the No. 1 goaltender for the Flyers.</p>
        <p>While the Devils are healthy with the exception of Krzysztof Oliwa, who was not expected to play in the playoffs, the Flyers are without Eric Lindros, who has been out with a concussion throughout the playoffs, and Keith Primeau. Primeau practiced with the Flyers today, however, and there is an outside chance he will play Sunday. If not in Sunday's first game, Primeau will most likely play on Tuesday in Game 2.</p>
        <p>''We figure he will play sooner or later,'' Devils Coach Larry Robinson said. ''They are more physical with him, but what makes them so good is that their power play is so dangerous. Our penalty killers will have to do their best against them.''</p>
