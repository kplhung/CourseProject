        <p>A FEW years after a wealthy brewer named Matthew Vassar founded Vassar Female College here, he decided the word ''Female'' was demeaning and deleted it from the name.</p>
        <p>It wasn't easy. The words had been registered with state authorities and chiseled in marble over the entrance to the Main Building. But Vassar had the state registration rewritten, and the marble slab bearing the word ''Female'' was replaced by a blank marble slab, leaving a gap of about 15 feet between the words ''Vassar'' and ''College.'' It looked odd then, and it looks odd today.</p>
        <p>Some townspeople joke that the founder had a premonition that one day the school would open its doors to men. Apocryphal or not, a little more than a century after its founding in 1861, Vassar did just that.</p>
        <p>It has been 30 years since that transition, raising the question: how has it worked out?</p>
        <p>Has Vassar been able to attract male students? And in sufficient number? If so, have the men come to dominate campus life? That, after all, was the fear that prompted the establishment of women's colleges in the first place.</p>
        <p>The short answer to these questions is both yes and no. Yes, the men have come in sufficient number (although Vassar has had to buck a national trend to get them). And no, the guys haven't taken over.</p>
        <p>Entering the 1,000-acre campus through the main gate, a visitor is confronted by the Main Building, a palatial structure in the Second Empire style. In 1986, it was named a National Historic Landmark, along with the Empire State Building and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.</p>
        <p>If there seems to be an especially energetic manicuring of the lawns, flower beds and buildings, that reflects the fact that Frances D. Fergusson, who has been president of Vassar since 1986, holds a doctorate in architectural history from Harvard and is passionate about campus beautification.</p>
        <p>''It's a great site,'' she said recently. ''I like to call it an arboretum of buildings.''</p>
        <p>Vassar's endowment of about $650 million -- it is one of the wealthiest small liberal arts colleges in the country -- allows Dr. Fergusson to put serious money into upkeep and reconstruction. And it shows.</p>
        <p>The treasures are not just brick and mortar. They include an accomplished faculty with standouts like Donald W. Foster, a professor of English who recently discovered a previously unknown poem by Shakespeare; James Merrell, a professor of history who just won his second Bancroft prize, this one for ''Into the American Woods'' (Norton, 1999), a study of American Colonial history; and Debra Elmegreen, a professor of astronomy and one of the college's most dynamic teachers, who recently presided over the school's acquisition of a $2.1 million, 32-inch research-grade telescope.</p>
        <p>Academicians consider Vassar a great place to teach because it's only an hour and a half from New York City.</p>
        <p>Now the male-female ratio among Vassar's 2,250 students is 39 to 61, said David Borus, dean of admissions and financial aid. That is just a whisker under the national average for men at small liberal arts colleges. Oberlin in Ohio has a ratio of 41 percent men to 59 percent women. Swarthmore in Pennsylvania, which makes a special appeal to men with its engineering program, weighs in at about 47 percent men to 53 percent women. At Goucher College in Maryland, the ratio is 30 to 70.</p>
        <p>There are more women than men at virtually all these small liberal arts institutions because many men are being siphoned off by colleges offering programs in engineering (Vassar has no engineering department) or by those with greater emphasis on sports (Vassar does not play intercollegiate football but competes at the Division III level in 22 varsity sports).</p>
        <p>Furthermore, Vassar, like all these colleges, is fighting a national trend in which men make up less than 45 percent of today's undergraduates. A chief reason for this enrollment gap, some experts believe, is that a strong working-class job market is luring many young men away from higher education.</p>
        <p>So how does Vassar fight that?</p>
        <p>In 1969 when Vassar first turned co-ed, some feared that it might lower its standards and use financial aid packages to attract men. Dean Borus, who was not at Vassar at the time, said he doubts that such practices were carried out, and he is certain that no such policies are pursued today. What he and his admissions staff will do, he said, is recruit men vigorously.</p>
        <p>''When we spot outstanding men in the prospect pool, given the national shortage of men, it's our inclination to go after them even more agressively,'' he said. ''We are careful to tell them about the excellence of our programs in the sciences and in sports.</p>
        <p>''Furthermore,'' Dean Borus said, ''we pay close attention to details such as making sure that the presence of men on the campus is accurately depicted in the college's promotional literature.''</p>
        <p>Most administrators here agree that it has been harder for Vassar to recruit well-qualified men than for colleges like Skidmore, Wheaton in Norton, Mass., and Connecticut College in New London, which went co-ed about the same time. The reason is not hard to find. It is because Vassar had been so successful in projecting itself as one of the leading women's colleges in the nation.</p>
        <p>Norman Fainstein, dean of the Vassar faculty, puts it this way: ''It's like merchandising. If you have the most famous product, it's that much more difficult to reposition yourself. Even some high school guidance counselors still haven't figured out that Vassar accepts men.''</p>
        <p>Dean Borus said: ''I can travel the world and the people I meet recognize the name Vassar, but many still think Vassar is a women's college.''</p>
        <p>Colton Johnson, a professor of English and dean of the college who has been on campus since 1965, said that Vassar was also indelibly stamped in the public mind as a women's college because the radical intellectuals here in the early years of the last century attracted great attention.</p>
        <p>''The suffragists were active here, and Vassar was also mentioned during the Red Scares,'' he said. ''Vassar stood out because the women here would not accept the general view that women were frail and could not endure hard work. That was news.''</p>
        <p>With the vigorous recruiting of men, is there concern here that they are dominating campus life? Even the late Alan Simpson, the president of Vassar who guided the transition in 1969, had warned a few years earlier that ''a co-educational campus is a male-dominated campus.''</p>
        <p>There is no evidence of that today. Students, faculty members and administrators agree that the sexes are treated as equals. Leadership positions like the top editors of the college newspaper and the literary magazines and the highest officers of student government tend to be filled alternately by men and women.</p>
        <p>And the faculty policy committee is led by a woman -- Professor Elmegreen.</p>
        <p>''There is a heritage here helping us to create a new image,'' Dean Borus said. ''It is the fact that Vassar still has many of its best characteristics -- a heritage of equality, a tradition in which men and women treat each other fairly, the fact that we've never had fraternities or sororities, no eating clubs, no societies. We don't have any of that nonsense of students acting inappropriately toward each other.''</p>
        <p>More evidence of the high status of women was provided by Jim Steerman, chairman of the Department of Drama and Film. Three of the four student-directed theatrical productions this year have been directed by women, he said.</p>
        <p>''Furthermore,'' Professor Steerman added, ''a senior drama major, Ianthe Demos, is directing Shakespeare's 'King Lear,' and the title role is being played by Ariane Barbanell.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most convincing testimony that co-education has succeeded comes from the students themselves.</p>
        <p>Take Norma Fabian, 22, a senior majoring in political science and Italian.</p>
        <p>''Vassar works for me,'' she said. ''Overall, I'll walk away with a sense of empowerment.''</p>
        <p>Or Michael O'Leary, 21, a senior history major who came here after graduating from Regis High School in Manhattan -- an all-boys prep school.</p>
        <p>''Before this, my interest in women was only romantic,'' he said, ''I really didn't know how they would be in class. I accepted the stereotype that they wouldn't speak up. But I found it very different. Here at Vassar the women are quite vocal, and I like getting a female perspective on things. My attitude toward women has changed. I love this school.''</p>
