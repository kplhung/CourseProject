        <p>MOVE over tempeh, tofu, miso, soy sauce, and all you other processed soy foods: the most up-and-coming variety of soybean is edamame, also known as vegetable soybeans. These are soybeans in their most primitive state --  picked young and green, steamed or boiled five minutes, then popped out of the pods right into your mouth.</p>
        <p>With 36 percent protein, a good dose of vitamin C and phytoestrogens, or plant-derived hormones, soybeans have always garnered high praise as a nutritional powerhouse. Their taste, though, can leave something to be desired: boiled mature (dry) soybeans have an unpleasant flavor and waxy texture, and tofu and tempeh are most esteemed for picking up other flavors.</p>

        <p>MOVE over tempeh, tofu, miso, soy sauce, and all you other processed soy foods: the most up-and-coming variety of soybean is edamame, also known as vegetable soybeans. These are soybeans in their most primitive state --  picked young and green, steamed or boiled five minutes, then popped out of the pods right into your mouth.</p>
        <p>With 36 percent protein, a good dose of vitamin C and phytoestrogens, or plant-derived hormones, soybeans have always garnered high praise as a nutritional powerhouse. Their taste, though, can leave something to be desired: boiled mature (dry) soybeans have an unpleasant flavor and waxy texture, and tofu and tempeh are most esteemed for picking up other flavors.</p>
        <p>Edamame, on the other hand, are delectable in their own right, combining the best of garden peas and lima beans in flavor and texture. Popular in Asia for millenniums, edamame now occasionally show up in markets on this side of the Pacific.</p>
        <p>Although edamame taste like peas and lima beans and grow much like green beans, they are as easy to grow as those familiar vegetables, or even easier. Edamame tolerate summer heat better than garden peas, which languish in July, and cool summer nights better than lima beans, which in my garden languish until July or, sometimes, all season. Mexican bean beetles devastate green beans and lima beans some years, but have little interest in soybeans. Rabbits and deer, however, find soybeans, like peas and other beans, a tasty dessert; edamame have even been recommended as a trap crop to lure them away from other vegetables.</p>
        <p>Edamame need warm soil to get started, so they should not be planted until about the date of the last killing frost. Throughout much of the Northeast, that date is about now, the same time you drop your first green bean or corn seeds into furrows out in the garden. Plant the seeds an inch deep in rows 15 to 30 inches apart. I garden in beds 36 inches wide, so run two rows of edamame, 18 inches apart, up a bed. A bed 20 feet long yields 25 quarts, a year's supply for my family of three edamame enthusiasts.</p>
        <p>For best use of space, up the middle of the bed I plant spinach, radishes, lettuce, or some other crop that is here and gone before the edamame plants fill in.</p>
        <p>Like those of green beans and other legumes, edamame roots partner with naturally occurring symbiotic bacteria that can convert atmospheric nitrogen into plant food, so they do not need an especially rich soil. To increase levels of those bacteria, sprinkle the wetted edamame seeds with commercially available inoculant powder before planting. Even without inoculation, natural levels of the bacteria might build up sufficiently after a number of years of growing soybeans.</p>
        <p>The strong influence of summer weather and day length on edamame growth make choosing a variety and the planting date important. Soybeans are classified into maturity groups adapted to narrow east-to-west bands across the United States.  The best varieties for my garden in the Hudson Valley and the rest of the Northeast are those in Groups 00, 0, or I (the higher the designation, the farther south the variety can grow).</p>
        <p>Day-length sensitivity also limits gardeners in the North to a single early planting, as I discovered the one year I made a second planting to try to extend the harvest period. My yield was paltry because of the small size of the plants at flowering.</p>
        <p>Before edamame seed became readily available, I had to use dry soybeans purchased each spring at a natural foods store, even though yields from such seeds were not always reliable. In the last decade or so, more mail-order catalogs have been offering edamame seeds, and those varieties are what I've grown since becoming aware of their availability. Envy has been a reliable variety year after year, with excellent flavor. The butterbeans variety is also very good. Last year I tried Shirofumi; it bore well and edged out the other varieties in flavor.</p>
        <p>For best quality, edamame must be harvested at the proper time. Picked prematurely, the beans are scrawny, with bland flavor; picked too late, they're on their way to becoming dry soybeans. The pods should be harvested just as soon as the beans are fully plump within them and while the pods are still bright green. The varieties I've grown bear over the course of a couple of weeks or so -- Envy after roughly 75 days, Butterbeans and Shirofumi after about 90. I pick repeatedly. At some sacrifice of yield, other gardeners wait until the bulk of the pods are ready for harvest, then cut down or pull out the plants and strip off the pods in the comfort of a shaded chair.</p>
        <p>If your edamame plants yield more than you can eat, the excess can be frozen. The five-minute steaming or boiling that readies pods for fresh eating also readies them for the freezer. I let the pods cool and dry for a few minutes in front of a fan before scooping them into freezer bags. Steam or boil the frozen pods about five minutes, and the beans are ready to pop out and eat.</p>
        <p>Soybeans were introduced into North America in the 18th century but didn't become a commercial crop until the 20th century, first for forage and then as a dry bean for animal feed and industrial use. Henry Ford was an early devotee of this plant, so much so that in the 1930's  each Ford automobile included a bushel of soybeans converted into  industrial products, like plastics. If  Ford had tasted edamame, we might all have been enjoying this delectable vegetable for decades.</p>
