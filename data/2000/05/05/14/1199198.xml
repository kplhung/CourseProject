        <p>SOMETHING seemed familiar about the grouping of the love seat and chairs -- and the big window beside it. For some reason, I kept imagining George Clooney on the other side, making funny faces. With a little boy?</p>
        <p>I was 10 minutes early for lunch at the ''21'' Club, and it took me half that time to realize that I was sitting exactly where Michelle Pfeiffer, as a terminally overworked architect and single mother, had sat in ''One Fine Day,'' the 1996 romantic comedy. Ms. Pfeiffer was trying to be serious, having drinks with Japanese clients, while her son and Mr. Clooney, her love interest, clowned outside the window. More than 40 years ago, ''21'' was also where Burt Lancaster's character, a ruthless Walter Winchell-like newspaper columnist, held court in the relentlessly powerful and gritty ''Sweet Smell of Success'' (1957).</p>
        <p>New York really isn't just one big film set, but it sometimes seems that way. And as one who moved to the city many years ago knowing it only from the movies, I considered the idea of devoting a long spring weekend to New York movie sites long overdue. I might even try to recreate a few of my favorite scenes.</p>
        <p>My first stop, Thursday after work, was Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village, where Robert Redford's stuffy-young-lawyer character has a few too many drinks and takes off his shoes to prove to his free-spirited bride (Jane Fonda) that he has a spontaneous side in ''Barefoot in the Park'' (1967). The park was fairly peaceful at this time of day, with not a bare foot in sight, even in the playground. Near the daffodils, a young man was rapping to his friends, rhyming cage, stage and seven-gauge. But mostly, people were strolling quietly. Sneakers were the most prevalent footwear.</p>
        <p>Grand Ticino, the homey Italian restaurant featured in ''Moonstruck'' (1987), is on Thompson Street, a couple of blocks below the park. This is where Danny Aiello proposed to Cher, and where Olympia Dukakis arrived for dinner alone (her husband was at the opera with another woman) but was joined by John Mahoney, who, as a college professor with a taste for younger women, had water thrown in his face, twice.</p>
        <p>My friend Rik and I ordered martinis, as Ms. Dukakis had. It was a quiet night, the beginning of a holiday weekend, and the place seemed more peaceful and more upscale than its movie self. In ''Moonstruck,'' the restaurant was in Brooklyn, but there's no doubt that this is the place: black-and-white photographs from the movie are in the entryway. The service was gracious, and the mushroom risotto to die for.</p>
        <p>The next day, my friend Janet and I headed for the Russian Tea Room for lunch, in honor of ''Tootsie'' (1982). This is where Sydney Pollack, playing Dustin Hoffman's agent, is startled when a strange woman brazenly slides in beside him at his red leather banquette. The woman turns out to be Mr. Hoffman, who has taken up transvestism in order to get better acting roles.</p>
        <p>This celebrated restaurant near Carnegie Hall has been renovated within an inch of its life, but there are still those desirable red banquettes in the first-floor dining room and we were lucky enough to get one. The food has never been the restaurant's strength, but my paillard of chicken with star-shaped Russian fries was fine and Janet was very happy with her rich blini royale. Once we got past the attitude-challenged hostess, the service was pleasant, too.</p>
        <p>Emerging onto West 57th Street, I needed help. This is where I turned to ''Manhattan on Film,'' by Chuck Katz (Limelight Editions, $14.95). Mr. Katz has a much greater interest in locations in less-than-classic films like ''Money Train'' (1995) and ''Bed of Roses'' (1996) than I do, but he also offers some wonderful tidbits. On his advice, I walked east on 55th Street, passing the elegant Peninsula Hotel. I hadn't realized that this was where the young Jon Voight, as an aspiring hustler in ''Midnight Cowboy'' (1969), came to meet one of his lonely female clients and was promptly thrown out. The hotel was called the Barclay in the film.</p>
        <p>Just across Fifth Avenue is the grand St. Regis Hotel, where, Mr. Katz reports, Goldie Hawn as an aging movie star with too much collagen in her lips tells her troubles to the bartender in the King Cole Bar in ''The First Wives Club'' (1996). In a driving rain, it seemed like a good idea to follow her lead. The bar was comforting, dark and about half full. I had a glass of red wine ($11, but it was nice and the nuts were superior), and the bartender looked like a good listener.</p>
        <p>F. A. O. Schwarz, three blocks north on Fifth, was my next stop. The giant piano keyboard where Tom Hanks did his dance in ''Big'' (1988) is long gone. But this is also where Diane Keaton went on a mad toy-shopping spree for her inherited toddler in ''Baby Boom'' (1987), and where Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman, shopping for their daughter, reflected on their sex life at the end of ''Eyes Wide Shut'' (1999). The store was packed with parents, children and oversized, high-priced stuffed animals.</p>
        <p>I never pass the Plaza, on the other side of Fifth, without thinking about Robert Redford and Barbra Streisand's running into each other there after years apart in ''The Way We Were'' (1973).</p>
        <p>The rain was getting worse, so I decided to call it a day. I did this secure in the knowledge that when I walked the dog that night, I would be passing 817 West End Avenue, near 100th Street, whose ornate arched doorway of glass and wrought iron was the exterior of Michael Douglas and Anne Archer's apartment building in ''Fatal Attraction'' (1987).</p>
        <p>Recreating the opening scene of ''Breakfast at Tiffany's'' (1961) was my grandest ambition and my biggest failure. The idea was to taxi at dawn to 57th Street and Fifth Avenue and serenely sip coffee and munch on pastry in front of Tiffany's windows in a black evening dress, pearls and oversize black sunglasses, as Holly Golightly (Audrey Hepburn) had. Maybe I went wrong when I copped out on the wardrobe. I thought a long black coat (over a sweater and jeans) could have the same effect.</p>
        <p>I did put on big black sunglasses and stop at the corner coffee shop for decaf and a chunk of Russian coffee cake. But the morning was gray and rainy, and even at 6:30 there were other pedestrians around and noisy traffic. Plus Tiffany's tiny jewel-box windows were filled with English ivy and spring flowers, accented with tiny pieces of jewelry. I had hoped for something purer.</p>
        <p>Later Saturday morning, I made a short walking tour of the Upper West Side. The Dakota, at Central Park West and 72nd Street, is best known now as the site of John Lennon's fatal shooting in 1980, but the building was a major character in its own right in ''Rosemary's Baby'' (1968). It's just the kind of wonderfully mysterious Victorian castle where young marrieds like Mia Farrow and John Cassavetes might find themselves getting entirely too close to the Devil.</p>
        <p>Staying with the supernatural theme, I headed for 55 Central Park West (between 65th and 66th Streets), the home of Sigourney Weaver -- and the demon inside her -- in ''Ghostbusters'' (1984). It is best viewed from a block or two away, for a good look at the roof, where the Ghostbusters' showdown with Gozer and the Gatekeeper took place. This building is absolute proof that Art Deco, darkened with the years, is Gothic.</p>
        <p>At Lincoln Center, a couple of blocks west, the fountain was in action, as it was when Cher and Nicolas Cage arrived for their evening at the opera in ''Moonstruck.'' (For the full effect of that scene, go at night, at Christmastime.) The fountain is also where Zero Mostel and Gene Wilder gleefully celebrated the partnership that resulted in the Broadway show ''Springtime for Hitler'' in ''The Producers'' (1968).</p>
        <p>But just across the street, on the northeast corner of Columbus Avenue and 63rd Street, is my favorite movie spot of all, for which I particularly thank ''Manhattan on Film.'' I've seen ''Annie Hall'' (1977) more than once but never noticed that this was where Annie (Diane Keaton) and Alvy (Woody Allen) say goodbye for the last time. The scene is shot through the window of the restaurant across the way -- O'Neal's Baloon then, Merlot now -- and it's a hundred times more poignant with the passing of time.</p>
        <p>My lunch plans were a cheat. The Algonquin Hotel on West 44th Street is actually better known for real-life events -- the alcohol-soaked lunches of the Algonquin round-table wits, including Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley and Alexander Woollcott, in the 1920's -- than for movies. In fact, Alan Rudolph's film ''Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle'' was shot in Toronto. But I had eggs benedict and white wine at a pleasant table under a painting of the group. The huge round table that dominates the dining room was filled by a family of eight discussing whether to go to the Macy's Flower Show.</p>
        <p>I should acknowledge that my tour, particularly the East Side portion, was heavily influenced by Woody Allen. But let's face it, the man owns the city's cinematic image. For example, in the afternoon, I checked into the Stanhope, on Fifth Avenue across from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, in tribute to Leonardo DiCaprio's scenes in Mr. Allen's ''Celebrity'' (1998). There would be no recreating here, either, because the scenes are of a spoiled young actor who hits his girlfriend and throws furniture around his suite in a fit of temper, then leaves the hotel (with a glimpse of its sidewalk cafe, Manhattan's prettiest) signing autographs for screaming fans. And I couldn't budge the marble-topped furniture, anyway.</p>
        <p>In an effort to behave like a celebrity, however, I insisted (well, O.K., begged) that my West Highland white terrier, Lillie, be allowed to stay with me, and demanded a VCR. Both requests were granted -- although the dog checked in only with special permission, an extra $100 a day and a promise that if she did any damage I would have to renovate the hotel at my own expense.</p>
        <p>THAT afternoon, I strolled past the sidewalk artists and the fountains of the museum, where Edward Norton burst into song out of love for Drew Barrymore in ''Everyone Says I Love You'' (1996). I walked to the Dalton School on East 89th Street, where Mr. Allen picked up his very young girlfriend, Margaux Hemingway, in ''Manhattan'' (1979). And I went up to Madison Avenue and 94th Street for a look at the castle tower that pretended to be part of a billionaire's house in ''The Fisher King'' (1991).</p>
        <p>Back at the Stanhope, room service dinner (roast free-range chicken with wild rice) was outstanding.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, I headed for the Lower East Side, to Katz's Delicatessen on East Houston at Ludlow Street, where Meg Ryan demonstrated her fake orgasm technique to Billy Crystal in ''When Harry Met Sally'' (1989). The place is large and noisy enough that Ms. Ryan might have been able to do her demonstration unnoticed on a busy day. On the other hand, the french fries are good enough that if she'd ordered those she might not have had to fake it.</p>
        <p>Just a few blocks south, on Essex Street, is Guss Pickles, where Amy Irving found her true, matchmaker-approved love, Peter Riegert, in ''Crossing Delancey'' (1988). I did indeed cross Delancey Street, but with a McDonald's and a pizza place on the corners, it didn't evoke a lot of nostalgia for Jewish family values. I strolled south to the Brooklyn Bridge, where I thought about walking across it in the footsteps of Meryl Streep, Kevin Kline and Peter MacNicol in ''Sophie's Choice'' (1982). I decided to wait for better weather.</p>
        <p>At 3:20 p.m., I got to the Empire State Building, determined to honor the lovers who swore to meet there in ''Love Affair'' (1939 and 1994), the in-between remake, ''An Affair to Remember'' (1957), and the homage-paying ''Sleepless in Seattle'' (1993) (and the title character of ''King Kong,'' of course, who knew the fastest way to the top). I'd done this before and knew to bring a crossword puzzle and a snack.</p>
        <p>Before I finally made it to the 86th-floor observation balcony, at 4:40, I decided that Irene Dunn, Deborah Kerr and Annette Bening were lucky to have been hit by taxis on their way here. At least they avoided the line. Any man or woman who would do this for the other and not arrive at the top too grumpy to kiss must be very much in love. An evening rendezvous (which Mr. Hanks and Ms. Ryan managed, thanks to the timing of his matchmaking son) takes much less time, I'm told.</p>
        <p>With those screen lovers on my mind, I went back to the Upper West Side for a final movie tribute. At 91st Street west of Riverside Drive, I entered Riverside Park and went straight to the community garden where Mr. Hanks and Ms. Ryan embraced at the end of ''You've Got Mail'' (1998). It was almost deserted -- just a few joggers and strollers -- and gorgeous, heavy on the tulips and lilies, lots of reds and yellows.</p>
        <p>I thought about the film's final scene: both stars looking deeply relieved and grateful that they're loved and accepted, Brinkley the dog scampering happily, the camera pulling back to show Manhattan in all its cinematic beauty. I felt an overwhelming need to go to the movies.</p>
        <p>Hollywood on the Hudson</p>
        <p>Here is a sampling of places in Manhattan where Hollywood has gone to eat, sleep and fall in love:</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>''21'' Club, 21 West 52nd Street, (212) 582-7200, served drinks to Burt Lancaster and Michelle Pfeiffer 40 years apart in ''Sweet Smell of Success'' and ''One Fine Day.'' The food is overpriced but surprisingly good, and the service lovely. Lunch for two with wine, about $150.</p>
        <p>Grand Ticino, 228 Thompson Street, between Bleecker and West Third Streets, (212) 777-5922, is where John Mahoney struck out twice in ''Moonstruck.'' It serves sophisticated but hearty Italian food. Dinner for two with wine, about $120.</p>
        <p>Russian Tea Room, 150 West 57th Street, (212) 974-2111, has been made over since Dustin Hoffman's makeover in ''Tootsie.'' But its menu still emphasizes caviar, blini and other Russian specialties. Lunch for two with wine, about $125.</p>
        <p>Katz's Delicatessen, 205 East Houston Street, at Ludlow, (212) 254-2246, is where Meg Ryan said ''Yes!'' in ''When Harry Met Sally.'' The menu is heavy on salami, pastrami and corned beef. Lunch for two, about $20.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>The Stanhope, 995 Fifth Avenue, at 81st Street, (212) 288-5800, fax (212) 650-4705, was a place for stars in ''Celebrity.'' It has 185 rooms, with doubles from $295.</p>
        <p>The Algonquin, 59 West 44th Street, (212) 840-6800, fax (212) 944-1419, with 188 rooms, for $279 and up, is probably better known for screenwriters than for screen idols. In the lobby restaurant, famous for its literary round table, lunch for two with wine costs about $60.</p>
        <p>The St. Regis, 2 East 55th Street, (212) 753-4500, fax (212) 787-3447, has 314 rooms, with doubles from $580. The King Cole Bar was seen in ''The First Wives Club.</p>
        <p>The Peninsula New York, 700 Fifth Avenue, at 55th Street, (212) 247-2200, fax (212) 903-3943, was called the Barclay in ''Midnight Cowboy.''  It has 241 rooms, from $460.</p>
        <p>The Plaza, Fifth Avenue between 58th and 59th Streets, (212) 546-5493, fax (212) 546-5324, a meeting place in ''The Way We Were,'' has 806 rooms, with doubles from $325.</p>
        <p>Where to Meet</p>
        <p>In the movies, everyone seems to end up at the Empire State Building, 350 Fifth Avenue, at 34th Street, (212) 736-3100. The 86th- and 102nd-floor observatories are open daily 9:30 a.m. to midnight. Admission, $7 (Dutch treat), $4 under 12.</p>
