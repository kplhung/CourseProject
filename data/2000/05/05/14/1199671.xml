        <p>A satirical form of intellectual sabotage took place at The Boston Globe 20 years ago. An editorial about President Carter's economic plan was scheduled to be headlined ''All Must Share the Burden.'' This is one of the dullest, most hackneyed cliches in journalism, always followed by a mournful paean to responsibility.</p>
        <p>Either a printer-prankster or an editorial writer who could not stand it any longer changed the headline at the last minute to ''Mush From the Wimp.'' This could have been a derogation of the president's policy or of the chief editorial writer's prose. The underground dissident was never caught, but editorialists ever since have been on the alert to this form of internal sabotage.</p>

        <p>A satirical form of intellectual sabotage took place at The Boston Globe 20 years ago. An editorial about President Carter's economic plan was scheduled to be headlined ''All Must Share the Burden.'' This is one of the dullest, most hackneyed cliches in journalism, always followed by a mournful paean to responsibility.</p>
        <p>Either a printer-prankster or an editorial writer who could not stand it any longer changed the headline at the last minute to ''Mush From the Wimp.'' This could have been a derogation of the president's policy or of the chief editorial writer's prose. The underground dissident was never caught, but editorialists ever since have been on the alert to this form of internal sabotage.</p>
        <p>(I remember this vividly because it triggered a column about the origin of wimp, defined as ''a person weepy as a drip and listless as a nebbish,'' derived from whimper and influenced by the name Wimpy, for a sleepy-eyed lover of hamburgers in the comic strip featuring Popeye the sailor. Wimp, a derogation dreaded more by politicians than ''ax murderer,'' has since been edged out by wuss, a rhyming form of unprintable etymology. But I digress.)</p>
        <p>Last month, in an editorial in The Washington Post supporting the Justice Department's raid on a Miami home to seize Elian Gonzalez, the headline remained as intended: ''The Elian Operation.'' But the key line read: ''Eight agents were in and out of the house in three minutes, carrying the boy in a blanket. ohhoh.''</p>
        <p>When I asked Fred Hiatt, editor of The Post's editorial page, about this strange insertion of ohhoh into the editorial, he muttered, ''We think it was a mechanical error.''</p>
        <p>I am prepared to accept this explanation from an embarrassed fellow opinion-monger, but am inclined to wonder: could ohhoh have been a prankster's surreptitious editorial comment on editorial comment? If so, what does it mean?</p>
        <p>The exclamation or interjection oho is defined in the O.E.D. as ''an exclamation expressing surprise, taunting, exultation.'' Its first recorded use was in 1369 as a shout to arouse a sleeper (some readers of editorials need this sort of anti-soporific) in a passage by Chaucer: ''This messenger . . . cried O how, a-wake anoon.'' Shakespeare changed the spelling when he picked it up in his 1601 ''Twelfth Night,'' with Malvolio telling himself, ''Oh ho, do you come neere me now.''</p>
        <p>Chaucer, in his 1386 ''Canterbury Tales,'' also spelled the exclamation differently: ''A ha the fox! and after him they ran.'' This sense of the sound as ''lo and behold'' was taken up in the 1611 King James Bible thrice in Ezekiel, transliterated from the Hebrew heach, later translated by some as indicating ''malicious joy.''</p>
        <p>In current use, oh-hoh has been overtaken by aha! -- its sense a ''triumphantly derisive discovery of a minor subterfuge.'' I asked the playwright Neil Simon about this a few years ago, and he came up with several meanings, from ''a response when you know something but find it unnecessary to share'' to ''the first half of an uncompleted sneeze.'' His most apt usage: ''Aha! is said sarcastically to your daughter when she says she came home at 11 last night when you know it was 12:15.''</p>
        <p>Now let's take a different tack. What if the mechanical errorist at The Washington Post meant to represent typographically a sound of wry derision, as if to say, ''Sure, that's what you say''? That would be spelled uh-huh. (That meaning is also expressed in what Edward Bleier of Time-Warner has termed the ''double positive,'' which turns the sense of the word around, as in ''yeah-yeah.'') Uh-huh is also the sound of ''I hear you, I understand'' or the slightly more affirmative ''Yeah, I guess so.'' The earliest recorded uses of uh-huh were in the late 19th century by magazine fiction writers transcribing Negro dialect, more as exclamation than affirmation.</p>
        <p>In contradistinction to that positive, if sometimes mocking, uh-huh is the clearly negative uh-uh. The first literary citation for this negation is in Dashiell Hammett's 1930 ''Maltese Falcon'': ''Do you know who he is?'' asks Effie Perine, and Sam Spade replies, ''Uh-uh, but I'd guess he was Captain Jacobi.''</p>
        <p>Now for a final run at the possible meaning of the mysterious ohhoh in The Post editorial.</p>
        <p>Dictionaries that have an entry for oh as ''an expression of wonderment'' fail to carry a definition of oh-oh, or the more staccato uh-oh. But almost every native speaker of American English knows oh-oh to mean ''watch out'' or ''trouble ahead''; when our leading lexicographers read this, they will utter uh-oh and hasten to include the commonly exclaimed warning in their next revisions.</p>
        <p>Could the phantom of the pressroom have meant ''Watch out -- the preceding opinion will draw a lot of mail''? Perhaps; we'll never know unless somebody confesses. But a new generation of proofreaders is now alerted to avert mush from the wimp.</p>
        <p>Power Mistake</p>
        <p>Beware the urge to be ultracorrect.</p>
        <p>Most power-writers know that the phrase corridors of power is identified with C.P. Snow, author of the 1964 novel of that name. In a recent article, I noted this, but after looking into the O.E.D., added, ''Actually, it was coined in the BBC's magazine, The Listener, in 1962, but popularized by Snow's title two years later.''</p>
        <p>Comes now Mary DeForest of Denver to set me straight. In a 1956 novel, ''Homecoming,'' Snow wrote, ''The official world, the corridors of power, the dilemmas of conscience and egotism -- she disliked them all.''</p>
        <p>In his preface to ''Corridors of Power,'' Snow explained: ''By some fluke, the title of this novel seems to have passed into circulation during the time the book itself was being written. I have watched the phenomenon with mild consternation.</p>
        <p>''The phrase was first used, so far as I know, in 'Homecoming.' . . . Mr. Rayner Heppenstall noticed it, and adopted it as a title for an article about my work. If he had not done this, I doubt if I should have remembered the phrase myself; but when I saw it in Mr. Heppenstall's hands, so to speak, it seemed the appropriate name for this present novel.''</p>
        <p>Snow knew it had become a cliche, but all must share the burden. As he put it, ''I console myself with the reflection that, if a man hasn't the right to his own cliche, who has?''</p>
