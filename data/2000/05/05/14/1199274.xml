        <p>IN its heyday, from the mid-1970's to the early 1980's, each year as many as 70,000 people attended the daylong New England Fiddle Contest in Hartford's Bushnell Park. Music lured people to the fiddle fest, but the easygoing camaraderie the tunes inspired made them want to linger. Picnic blankets were spread, babies were jiggled in time to the music, and Hartford basked in the glow of the event.</p>
        <p>Feeling nostalgic? You're in luck. The festival, which returned last year after a 15-year hiatus, will take place again on May 27, from 9:30 a.m. until dusk.</p>
        <p>In an era filled with talk of peace, love and understanding, it's not surprising that an organization named Peace Train would conceive the fiddle fest. In the 1970's, the group's members were committed to bringing free entertainment to the city of Hartford, sometimes via an old school bus decked out in vibrant colors.</p>
        <p>Twenty-six years and far shorter sideburns later, some former members of the nonprofit group reunited (sans bus), under the leadership of Peace Train's founder, Paul LeMay, to revive the fiddle fest. Last year, the event attracted a crowd of about 5,000 people. This year, Peace Train is producing the festival in partnership with the Hartford Downtown Council, which works with the MetroHartford Chamber of Commerce to promote the city.</p>
        <p>''One of the great things about the fiddle fest is the cross-section of the crowd,'' said Mr. LeMay, a tall man in his 50's who favors berets and the kind of vests worn by professional photographers or fishermen. (In fact, he is a semiretired computer specialist for a Hartford insurance company.) ''We get the people who arrive on Harley Davidsons and Yamahas and those who drive up in BMW's,'' said Mr. LeMay.</p>
        <p>Mr. LeMay said he would be pleased if the fiddle fest inspired younger people to join the Peace Train organization. Last year's festival was produced in part to mark the 25th anniversary of the founding of Peace Train.</p>
        <p>More than 55 fiddlers will compete in several categories at this year's free festival. Three members of the North America Fiddling Judges Organization will evaluate the performers, but an audience applause meter will gauge who is the best in the ''trick and fancy'' division.</p>
        <p>'' 'Trick and fancy' is shorthand for nontraditional fiddling,'' said Tim Woodbridge, a former judge at the fiddle fest and a retired lawyer who lives in Granby. Playing the fiddle while holding it behind your back or standing on your head could be among the tricks. The category also includes variations on popular fiddle songs, like ''The Orange Blossom Special,'' a tune as familiar to the fiddling community as ''Happy Birthday'' is to the rest of us. (Another note to the uninitiated: the violin and the fiddle are the same instrument.)</p>
        <p>The other divisions are determined by age. There are two junior divisions, 12 and under and 13 to 18, as well as the open division for ages 18 to 64 and the senior division for people 65 and older. Mr. LeMay said many children perform, and several return as adults to play.</p>
        <p>Jon Steucek a 50-year-old woodworker who lives in Cromwell, plans to return to this year's fiddle fest. For him the contest is a ''fun day, a chance to play some good tunes for people and listen to other people play,'' he said. In the many years that Mr. Steucek has played in the festival, he has performed accompanied by a guitar and a bass fiddle. The rest of the year, his band, the Portable Folk Festival, performs at various country fairs; for the past 18, they have played at the Fourth of July Chester Road Race.</p>
        <p>For others who perform professionally, the festival renews old acquaintances and sometimes leads to more gigs.</p>
        <p>That has been true for Donna Hebert, a 51-year-old Northhampton fiddler who travels around the country, performing with three different bands. A two-time winner in the open division, she favors tunes of her Canadian ancestors. ''For some people the festival is a chance to play out,'' she said referring to playing for an audience. ''For me, it's very much a social thing, a chance to schmooze.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hebert gingerly described the early years of the fiddle fest by saying, ''It was a more permissive time.'' Wine was the beverage of choice for many at the early festivals; no alcohol is permitted at the more recent festivals.</p>
        <p>The festival has very modest origins. The first, inspired by a small festival Mr. LeMay discovered while hitchhiking in Vermont, cost less than $2,000. It was 1974, and Peace Train members knocked on the doors of corporations to get money. They continue to do so today, although they have added a Web site (www.fiddlefest.org) to their retinue. Mr. Woodbridge said the festival grew to be so big, it ''took on a life of its own.'' Soon, the city of Hartford asked Peace Train for money for crowd control and clean-up. Eventually, corporate funding grew scarce, Peace Train members grew older, and the event fizzled out in 1984.</p>
        <p>This year the festival is expected to cost about $80,000, Mr. LeMay said. Funding from the Big Y Supermarket chain came through just last month. The event will include various food booths, and a preview concert, probably of bluegrass music, will be held the night before to draw media attention to the festival. The rain date is Sunday.</p>
        <p>''The event became a happening, and hopefully it still is,'' Mr. Woodbridge said. ''All sorts of people will be there, from very dedicated music lovers to people who want their children to hear fiddle music to those who simply think it might be a good day to bask in the sun on a blanket.''</p>
        <p>What made the early years of the fiddle fest so popular?</p>
        <p>''I think it was a carryover from the 1960's, getting together for music,'' said Tony Caruso, the executive director of the Hartford Downtown Council. For others, the day evokes more distinct, albeit less music-oriented, memories.</p>
        <p>''The weather was warm, and girls wore cutoff shorts,'' mused a 45-year-old Hartford businessman who declined to give his name. ''It was a good day.''</p>
