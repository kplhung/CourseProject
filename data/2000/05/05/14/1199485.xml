        <p>THE car business is booming these days -- in Europe, Mexico and Brazil as well as in the United States -- and the shares of General Motors have climbed nearly 17 percent so far this year. Of course, G.M. has major technology exposure in the form of its Hughes Electronics business. (While G.M. owns all of Hughes's assets, G.M.'s class H shares are designed to track the unit's earnings independently.)</p>
        <p>Even with G.M.'s run-up, however, its  stock trades at less than nine times projected earnings, scarcely one-third the average multiple accorded the Dow industrials.</p>
        <p>Yet analysts have recently soured on G.M., still the world's biggest company by revenue. In the last two weeks, many of them have cut their ratings on the stock.</p>
        <p>One of them, John A. Casesa, a managing director at Merrill Lynch, took time on Thursday to explain his change of heart about G.M. and why its archrival, Ford Motor, seems relatively attractive. Following are excerpts from the conversation:</p>
        <p>Q. We know that investors usually look ahead, not in rear-view mirrors. But sales are still setting records, with G.M.'s new pickup trucks a huge hit. What's not to like?</p>
        <p>A.  Autos are early-cycle stocks. They tend to outperform dramatically as the economy recovers and underperform later. We're very deep into this current cycle. Since 1991, 130 million vehicles have been sold in the U.S. Essentially, every household has replaced at least one vehicle. It's a risky time to invest.</p>
        <p>Q. But everybody seemed to love the stock until the last few weeks. What's changed?</p>
        <p>A.  It has been terrific because the company's done some brilliant financial engineering. It is monetizing a big chunk of its very valuable stake in Hughes Electronics, essentially using high-priced Hughes stock to buy back low-priced G.M. common.</p>
        <p>The reason we lowered our opinion is that this transaction, which was announced in February, comes to an end May 19. Then the outlook goes back to automotive fundamentals, which is a very peaky market and, in G.M.'s case, means a continuing struggle to stabilize its market share.</p>
        <p>Q. But aren't the new Silverado and Sierra pickups quite competitive?</p>
        <p>A.  There's a big shift in emphasis in the company's plans, away from passenger cars and toward light trucks. But it's largely catch-up. The new products are better than the old ones, but they still have to contend with the declining competitiveness of these older products.</p>
        <p>Q. G.M.'s market capitalization of about $53  billion is only one-eighth that of Cisco. Could somebody like Rupert Murdoch really take it over, as some people have suggested?</p>
        <p>A.  There's a great deal of interest in Hughes, in particular its DirecTV business. The rumored buyers are News Corporation and even Disney. Even after the current deal, G.M. will still own more than $10 billion of the Hughes tracking stock, or 15 percent.</p>
        <p>Investors are eager to know whether someone will come along and pay a big premium for Hughes and spin off the automotive business. But it's not that easy to do. Since G.M. owns 100 percent of Hughes's equity, it would require a very friendly deal with G.M.; it would have to get done on their terms. And there are very practical political, labor and regulatory issues.</p>
        <p>Q. But G.M.'s history has been to sell off noncore businesses, as with Delphi last year.</p>
        <p>A.  That's right. In fact, it's not a matter of if G.M. will divest the rest of Hughes, it's a matter of when. They want to get the maximum price, and capital gains are a consideration. Divestiture is not around the corner.</p>
        <p>Q. What are you advising clients to do about the offer expiring on May 19 to swap each share of their G.M. stock for 1.065 shares of Hughes?</p>
        <p>A.  We're advising that people tender. It's a very attractive way to get some Hughes and lower your exposure to the auto business. But the deal is limited so you won't be able to exchange all your shares, only 14 percent of them if every G.M. share was tendered.</p>
        <p>Q. At the same time, you're recommending putting money into Ford. Why?</p>
        <p>A.  Just as G.M. is completing this value-enhancing transaction, Ford is about to do the same thing on a smaller scale.</p>
        <p>Ford, which has billions in excess capital, will give shareholders a big cash dividend sometime before the end of July and then spin off to them its parts business called Visteon.</p>
        <p>Q. Is Ford better as a car company than G.M.?</p>
        <p>A.  I think so. Its margins are higher, and it has acquired Jaguar, Volvo and now is adding Land Rover. . . . This takes the product line more upscale, and luxury cars are far more profitable than mass-market cars. And Ford has laid out a credible plan to improve its European business, which has been a mess.</p>
