        <p>Modern Dance</p>
        <p>Earl Mosley's Diversity of Dance company, founded in 1996, is becoming one of the hottest modern dance ensembles. In just four years Mr. Mosley has choreographed 30 dances for the company, and he has created additional works for the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and the American Ballet Theater, among others.</p>
        <p>He and his troupe will perform on Friday at 8 p.m. at the Fine Arts Center of Naugatuck Valley College in Waterbury, presented by Litchfield Performing Arts.</p>
        <p>Scores for ''Litchfield'' and ''Young Words,'' two of five new works, are by Charles Coleman. ''Sunrise,'' Mosley's signature piece, traces the African-American struggle through the eyes of his 100-year-old grandmother, Bethel Lane.</p>
        <p>Tickets at $15, $6 for students, may be reserved by calling (860) 567-4162. The college is at 750 Chase Parkway.</p>
        <p>Bloomsbury's Names</p>
        <p>Mention the word Bloomsbury and a rush of names floods the mind: Virginia Woolf, John Maynard Keynes, Lytton Strachey, Dora Carrington, Duncan Grant, Vanessa Bell, Roger Fry, and so on down a list of writers, artists and intellectuals. They flourished and flouted their social and sexual styles in the early 1900's in Bloomsbury -- a residential section of London whose name attached itself to the group.</p>
        <p>An exhibition called ''The Art of Bloomsbury'' opens at the Yale Center for British Art in New Haven on Saturday, remaining through Sept. 3. It is the final stop for collections of works from the Tate and the National Portrait Gallery in London, and from other British collections and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.</p>
        <p>Portraits of Virginia Woolf, Aldous Huxley and E. M. Forster by Bell, Fry and Grant are among some 120 paintings. In addition there are sculptures, works on paper, decorative objects and books, including all  Woolf's novels, and rare photographs by Man Ray and Julia Margaret Cameron.</p>
        <p>Lectures and concerts are scheduled through the run of the exhibition, beginning with a free talk at 5:15 on May 24 by Richard Shone, a leading authority on Bloomsbury and curator of the exhibition. He will speak at the Yale University Art Gallery, 1111 Chapel Street, on the subject ''Bloomsbury: For and Against.''</p>
        <p>The Center for British Art, at 1080 Chapel Street, is open free of charge on Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday from noon to 5. For a recorded list of events and information call (203) 432-2800.</p>
        <p>Wildflowers and Tea</p>
        <p>Nature walks and talks celebrating birds, butterflies, and all manner of flora and fauna now include the ladyslipper. This wild and showy member of the orchid family is the subject of eight programs at the Denison Pequotsepos Nature Center in Mystic.</p>
        <p>On Thursday at 7 a.m. one can stroll among the ladyslippers and other wildflowers, fortified by tea, coffee and bagels. Children will have their own program at 3:45 the same afternoon.</p>
        <p>Lunch among the flowers on Friday at noon is an option, and from 6 to 8 p.m., visitors will combine strolls with May wine, hors d'oeuvres, and the songs of migrating birds under a full moon.</p>
        <p>Got a canoe? Then paddle along with a guided tour of the Mystic River to a sanctuary where ladyslippers abound, or take a botanical illustration class at the Mystic Art Association. An additional breakfast walk and a tea are also available on Saturday. Fees run from $3 for the canoe trip to $20 for the art class. Call (860) 536-1216 to register or obtain more information.</p>
        <p>Old Wethersfield</p>
        <p>Old Wethersfield, founded in 1634 as an English village and listed on the National Register of Historic Places, may well be the state's ''most ancient town.'' For the past three years it has celebrated its history with a festival that takes place again on Friday, Saturday and next Sunday.</p>
        <p>It is the state's largest historic district, containing more than 1,100 buildings dating from 1700 to the 20th century. Many will become sites for entertainment, educational programs and tours on Saturday and Sunday, particularly the Joseph Webb House, the Silas Deane House, the Isaac Stevens House and the Buttolph-Williams House.</p>
        <p>The first events on Friday evening are lantern-light tours of the Ancient Burying Ground. A children's tour is scheduled from 6:30 to 7:30, and anyone who wishes may take the 7:30 to 10 p.m. tour.</p>
        <p>Saturday's attractions from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. include a Historical Society beer garden, a tags and treasures sale, a Revolutionary War encampment, demonstrations of sailmaking, coopering, blacksmithing and other skills as well as rowboat rides and Connecticut River Cruises, architectural tours aboard a trolley, rides on ponies, hay wagons and carriages. Other events include a handbell concert, a costumed Colonial concert and another graveyard tour. Music, entertainment and food will be plentiful each day.</p>
        <p>Most of the features will be repeated from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Sunday  with the addition of a 75-dealer antiques show. Free shuttle buses will transport visitors from parking lots to various sites in a rotating loop every 15 minutes. Fees for boat rides, trolley tours, house tours, graveyard tours and the tag sale and antiques show range from $2 to $6, free to $3 for children. To obtain a complete schedule call (860) 721-2975.</p>
        <p>Making Movies</p>
        <p>The New Milford Film Commission has put together a panel of documentary filmmakers who will talk about the genre in a program at 3 p.m. on Saturday. It will be held on the second floor of the public library.</p>
        <p>With 40 years in the business and a Guggenheim fellowship to his credit, Albert Maysles, creator of ''Gimme Shelter'' and ''Salesman,'' is one participant. The others include Alan and Susan Raymond, who won an Academy Award for ''I Am a Promise: The Children of Stanton Elementary School.'' William Greaves has won 70 international film festival awards chronicling the lives and concerns of African Americans. His latest work for PBS is ''Ralph Bunche: An American Odyssey,'' narrated by Sidney Poitier.</p>
        <p>Finally, there is John Friedman, another Academy Award winner for ''Hotel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie'' and the founder of the Documentary Center at Columbia University. Admission is free but reservations must be made at (860) 355-6081.</p>
        <p>Crafts on the Lawn</p>
        <p>The Bruce Museum in Greenwich has corraled some 75 outstanding craftspeople from across the country for its 15th annual juried Outdoor Craft Festival scheduled on Saturday and next Sunday from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p>
        <p>As always, the ceramics and fiber, jewelry and leather, paper and glass, wood and metal are accompanied by continuous and unusual music -- this year provided by classical guitarist Ed Wright, the Peruvian flutists called America Manta, the Profile Reggae Band and Inca Campers.</p>
        <p>Children will be kept busy with their own craft projects, and there will be plenty of vegetarian food in addition to burgers and fries. Parking at nearby lots is $3, and that includes admission to the museum grounds and the festival. The Bruce is just off Exit 3 of Interstate 95, and the number for more information is (203) 869-0376.</p>
        <p>Old Houses</p>
        <p>''Preservation Doesn't Cost -- It Pays,'' is the title and premise of a statewide conference organized by the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation. It takes place from 8:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Friday at St. George Church, 33 Whitfield Street, Guilford.</p>
        <p>The keynote address will be delivered at 10:45 by Bob Yapp, a renovation contractor, developer, planning consultant and host of the PBS television program ''About Your House with Bob Yapp.''</p>
        <p>Experts will conduct workshops throughout the day on meeting preservation challenges at the local level, the 1998 Village Districts Act, combining historic preservation with economic development, dealing with teardowns, and Connecticut's Historic Homes Rehabilitation Tax Credit, among others.</p>
        <p>Speakers include Helen Higgins, executive director of the Connecticut Trust for Historic Preservation, John W. Shannahan, director of the Connecticut Historical Commission and State Historic Preservation Officer, antique home specialists, municipal development directors, lawyers, insurance specialists and land use officials.</p>
        <p>The fee is $40 and box lunches will be available for purchase. To register or obtain more information call (203) 562-6312.</p>
        <p>Artisans in Milford</p>
        <p>For 38 years Meet the Artists and Artisans events have drawn thousands of browsers and buyers to nearly overwhelming displays of art and crafts. The variety and quantity pretty much insures that there will be something for everybody.</p>
        <p>An enumeration of what is in store for visitors to the Milford Green, where such an event will be in progress from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., on Saturday and next Sunday, rain or shine, includes portrait and caricature artists working on location, swags and garlands of Texas dried fuit, herbs and seeds; Raku pottery, stringed instruments, musicians playing Celtic harps, hats laden with flowers, furniture makers making furniture, vintage and contemporary fabrics.</p>
