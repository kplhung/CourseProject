        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani canceled an upstate campaign trip yesterday as aides said he wanted to devote the weekend to making a final decision on both his treatment options for prostate cancer and whether he wanted to proceed with his campaign for the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's aides said the mayor could decide whether to continue his campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton as soon as tomorrow.</p>
        <p>The mayor, who customarily makes himself available to reporters on Saturdays, had also cleared his daytime schedule yesterday. But then, as is his routine during a public safety emergency, he went to the Bronx yesterday afternoon, alongside police and fire officials, after 20 missing drums of potassium cyanide were found on a residential street, forcing the evacuation of some residents.</p>
        <p>Speaking briefly with reporters about his decision to cancel his trip upstate, where he was to give a speech at the Holiday Inn in Oneonta at a fund-raising dinner sponsored by Delaware County Republicans, the mayor said: ''I decided that I needed the time to do some consultation. At this point, I don't think I was up to taking the trip, actually just taking the trip in the car for three hours.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's decision to cancel was just one sign that he was moving into the final phases of making a decision about the race. However, the mayor said he canceled his appearance at the dinner for health reasons, and he did not directly address the question of whether he would stay in the race.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't a good idea to do it health-wise,'' he said of the upstate trip. ''That was the choice I made.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani indicated that he would also cancel a trip to California, scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday, saying he did not have time last week to meet with doctors.</p>
        <p>In the last two weeks, Mr. Giuliani has announced that he has prostate cancer, is separating from his wife of 16 years and has established a relationship with an Upper East Side woman.</p>
        <p>''You should not view the fact that I will cancel several things next week as anything other than the fact that I didn't get the chance to meet with doctors I had to meet with last week, and I have to do it next week,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''And I didn't get the chance for obvious reasons, because of personal issues that came up.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani was said to be receiving conflicting advice from aides about what to do about the Senate campaign, though several people close to the mayor said it seemed  increasingly unlikely that he would stay in the race.</p>
        <p>Referring to the mayor's decision to cancel the speech last night, Mr. Giuliani's campaign manager, Bruce Teitelbaum, said yesterday: ''He's entitled to some time for himself to contemplate his medical treatment. This is the first day in a long time that he'll have an opportunity to sit back and to think seriously about his medical treatment, and he's certainly entitled to the time.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani is scheduled to appear at a televised town hall meeting on Thursday night at the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan, but it was unclear yesterday whether he would go ahead with the program.</p>
        <p>At City Hall yesterday, the mayor's office said Mr. Giuliani had no public events scheduled for today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's advisers acknowledged that in this intense environment, he might have difficulty maintaining the privacy he says he is seeking. On Friday night, Mr.  Giuliani had dinner on the Upper East Side with Judith Nathan, the woman whom he has called a ''very good friend,'' before strolling the streets of Manhattan, trailed by a flock of photographers.</p>
        <p>Asked for a reaction to the pictures of him and Ms. Nathan on yesterday's front pages of The Daily News and The New York Post, Mr. Giuliani said: ''I don't have any reaction to it. It speaks for itself.''</p>
        <p>After announcing his cancer diagnosis two weeks ago, the mayor last week acknowledged a relationship with Ms. Nathan, a 45-year-old sales manager for a drug company, and said she had been a comfort to him  during a difficult time and he would continue to rely on her support as he contemplated his medical treatment.</p>
        <p>Donna Hanover, the mayor's wife, is spending the weekend in California with her parents, her aides said.</p>
