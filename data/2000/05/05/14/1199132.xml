        <p>Tour buses will drop you at the Jaffa Gate, so that you must ascend to Jerusalem's Old City, accruing reverence with each steep step. I prefer the Damascus Gate, an entry by descent, a plunge into the pulsating souks of the walled city's largest district, the Muslim quarter. You glide down worn stone steps, past the posters of Arab pop stars laid out like prayer rugs.</p>
        <p>Elderly Palestinian women, in embroidered dresses, squat behind bags of snap peas. Young boys perfume the air with with bunches of fresh mint they wave under your nose. And that is all before you step through the turreted archway that is the main entrance to the Old City from East Jerusalem. This is not the quarter in which to find your stuffed camels or gold-plated menorahs or millennium-special rosary beads. But it is a place to soak up the vibrant daily life of the intimate cobblestone alleys behind the city's monumental stone walls.</p>

        <p>Elderly Palestinian women, in embroidered dresses, squat behind bags of snap peas. Young boys perfume the air with with bunches of fresh mint they wave under your nose. And that is all before you step through the turreted archway that is the main entrance to the Old City from East Jerusalem. This is not the quarter in which to find your stuffed camels or gold-plated menorahs or millennium-special rosary beads. But it is a place to soak up the vibrant daily life of the intimate cobblestone alleys behind the city's monumental stone walls.</p>
        <p>At Abu Ziad's coffee shop, for instance, just inside the gate, Palestinian men play cards, chat and smoke fruity tobacco through water pipes. Downhill from there, at the crossroads between the turnoff to the Al Aqsa Mosque and the one to the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, a man named Mohammed rolls chickpea balls at an impressive clip, dropping them into giant vats of bubbling oils to make falafel. Deeper inside, in a hole in the wall, Nabil Kharem, a cobbler, wears a splattered leather apron as he labors over his grandfather's 50-year-old Singer sewing machine.</p>
        <p>What can a visitor bring home from such a working market? A pair of Day-Glo sandals for your toddler, perhaps, or a Baggie of fragrant orange saffron, or a dangling Bedouin coin necklace, or a deep-red cushion cover. More important, you will be left with the sense memories -- the mingling spices, the rhythms of the music that blend with the syncopated voices of the hawkers, the brilliance of embroidered fabric draping the more squalid lanes, the sunlight glancing off white stones and disappearing up stairs into residential recesses.</p>
