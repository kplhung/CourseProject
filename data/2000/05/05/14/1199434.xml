        <p>Matt Farrell recalls driving through a residential section of Forest Hills last August with his boss, Councilwoman Karen Koslowitz, when they came upon an agitated crowd at a construction site on Kew Forest Lane near 77th Road. Curious, he and Ms. Koslowitz got out to see what was happening.</p>
        <p>''They were yelling and screaming,'' he said. The issue was whether the construction crew was digging under the house next to the site.</p>
        <p>That dispute was just the opening scene in a continuing clash between local residents and Albert Mushibayev, a developer, and his brother-in-law, Joseph Lieberman, an architect. The two plan to build a six-story apartment building with ground-floor medical offices on a lot that once held a 1922 colonial-style home.</p>
        <p>Members of the Kew Forest Neighborhood Association, which formed last year to fight the plan, say such a dense development would undermine the character of their neighborhood of distinctive private homes as surely as a house foundation would be undermined if a backhoe dug under it. But the developers' lawyer, Philippe Zimmerman, said an apartment building fits the area, since ''Queens is now a metropolitan urban center of its own.''</p>
        <p>The association scored a victory in April when the City Council passed a measure introduced by Ms. Koslowitz that rezoned the four-block area to permit only single-family houses. The Buildings Department may now be asked to decide whether enough of the apartment foundation has been poured to allow Mr. Mushibayev to proceed under the old zoning.</p>
        <p>But first, a lawsuit brought against the developers by the neighborhood association must be decided in Supreme Court. The group asserts that a 1919 homeowners' covenant allows only single-family homes in the area. But Mr. Zimmerman said the covenant applied to the original property owners, not to the current ones. A judge has issued a restraining order against further construction until he renders a decision, which is expected shortly.</p>
        <p>''This site has implications for the whole borough,'' said Pat Dolan, vice president of the Queens Civic Congress, who said residents of other neighborhoods had found covenants for their properties that might also be used to prohibit apartment buildings. She said they were waiting to see whether the association had set a precedent by winning its lawsuit.</p>
        <p>''An apartment building is as inappropriate for Kew Forest Lane, and neighborhoods like it, as the Trump Building is for the neighborhood near the United Nations,'' she said.</p>
