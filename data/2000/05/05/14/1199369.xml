        <p>The Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency have informally agreed to extend for at least six months a May 15 deadline for public comment on a project to remove mercury, silver, copper, PCB's and low levels of radionuclides, including plutonium, from the headwaters of the Peconic River.</p>
        <p>Suffolk County legislators and environmental groups had questioned whether the project was being rushed and might do more harm than good. They said alternatives, including the use of plants that absorb contaminants, should be explored more fully.</p>

        <p>The Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency have informally agreed to extend for at least six months a May 15 deadline for public comment on a project to remove mercury, silver, copper, PCB's and low levels of radionuclides, including plutonium, from the headwaters of the Peconic River.</p>
        <p>Suffolk County legislators and environmental groups had questioned whether the project was being rushed and might do more harm than good. They said alternatives, including the use of plants that absorb contaminants, should be explored more fully.</p>
        <p>The legislature voted unanimously last Tuesday to ask for the extension to allow completion of a county health and environmental assessment of the river.</p>
        <p>The federal project would take place on the grounds of Brookhaven National Laboratory, the source of the contamination and where the Peconic River begins, and in a river area immediately adjacent to the laboratory's eastern boundary.</p>
        <p>It would involve isolating and removing water from river sections, excavating and dewatering the contaminated river sediments, and shipping the sediments to a licensed disposal facility off Long Island.</p>
        <p>The plan for the project, which would be part of a federal Superfund cleanup at the laboratory, said the amount and exact location of excavation would be decided later.</p>
        <p>Robert Alvarez, the executive director of Standing for Truth About Radiation of East Hampton and a former senior policy adviser to the Secretary of Energy, said what he called the ''ready, shoot, aim'' approach to the project failed to apply basic cleanup principles.</p>
        <p>Others said the project would stir up contaminants that had been embedded in sediments for decades. They said heavy equipment would also destroy wetlands.</p>
        <p>''We want a cleanup plan that cleans up the river but preserves wetlands and river habitat,'' said Adrienne Esposito, the associate executive director of Citizens Campaign for the Environment. ''This plan does neither.''</p>
