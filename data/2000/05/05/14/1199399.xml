        <p>The bagel. The knish. The pepperoni slice. To couple the words ''Brooklyn'' and ''food'' is to evoke these legendary immigrant-inspired snacks that over the last century have filled the bellies of locals and injected pizazz into palates of Americans from Memphis to Malibu.</p>
        <p>But lest anyone think Brooklyn's gastronomic glories are limited to these classics, the Brooklyn Chamber of Commerce last year created Brooklyn's Kitchen, a program intended to help the borough's food manufacturers develop and increase sales of Brooklyn fare around the country.</p>
        <p>Why Brooklyn? It has more food manufacturers than any other borough, with food making up 12 percent of its economic development, said Shawn Starbuck, assistant director of the pilot program, which serves 32 small and midsize clients. The borough's diversity also makes it ideal.</p>
        <p>''The different ethnic pockets that make up Brooklyn all have their own food component,'' Ms. Starbuck said. ''There's the Italian sections, the Middle East sections, the Russians in Brighton Beach. The whole food scene in Brooklyn is changing as people  develop products they've made at home and try to sell them in this market.''</p>
        <p>To make her point, Ms. Starbuck (who is no relation to the coffee chain, although she noted that Starbucks' founder was a Brooklyn boy), dropped in on some of her favorite spots the other day.</p>
        <p>DAMASCUS BAKERIES, DUMBO -- For anyone who has ever pondered the mysteries of the pita, Edward Mafoud has the answers. Towering over six feet, white hairnet peeking out under a yellow construction hat, Mr. Mafoud, grandson of America's first pita manufacturer, led visitors into his hot, bread-scented warehouse on Gold Street.</p>
        <p>Puffy, sandwich-sized pitas glided by on conveyor belts as Mr. Mafoud described the mating habits of yeasts (''typically an asexual reproduction'') and stretched dough over his hand to demonstrate the window test (''If I can see my fingernails through that piece of dough, I've done my job'').</p>
        <p>When Mr. Mafoud's Syrian-born grandfather, Hassan Halaby, started Damascus Bakeries in an Atlantic Avenue storefront in 1930, five employees made the pitas by hand. Today, 60 employees work around the clock, producing 11,000 pitas per hour in 11 different flavors, including cinnamon-raisin and pesto. The company also makes flatbread for wraps, which Mr. Mafoud praises as a fat-free alternative to tortillas.</p>
        <p>But the real mystery lies inside the pita.</p>
        <p>''I know what you want to ask: how does it get its pocket?'' Mr. Mafoud said, nodding wisely. ''A lot of people think, 'Well, why don't you put two pieces of dough one on top of the other?' Well, that's not how it's done.'' Rather, he explained: ''We cook the pita bread for 50 seconds at 900 degrees Fahrenheit. As it gets hot, thousands if not millions of air bubbles form. They become excited and move further and further apart. Finally we get one continuous bubble, or pocket.''</p>
        <p>STEVE'S KEY LIME PIES, RED HOOK -- ''I'm the key lime guy,'' admitted Steve Tarpin, standing in shorts and an apron in a small doorway on Columbia Street. It would be hard to deny, given the hulking 1953 Ford panel delivery truck out front that's painted a creamy pale green and reads ''Steve's Authentic Key Lime Pies.'' But now that Mr. Tarpin has moved his five-year-old business out of his Boerum Hill studio apartment and ''gone legit,'' with two employees and an 800-square-foot storefront he shares with a wedding cake baker, he can afford to boast.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tarpin's interest in key limes goes far beyond just squeezing them. ''This is the true lime,'' he said, plucking a pinball-sized yellow-skinned fruit from a box. ''It originated in south Asia, the Arabs brought it through the spice trade and passed it over to the Spanish. The Spanish and Portuguese brought them to the New World.''</p>
        <p>Shaking his head reproachfully, Mr. Tarpin displayed a bottle of preservative-laced juice concentrate that he said most key lime pie manufacturers rely on. To counter such travesties, Mr. Tarpin has created a Web site, www.keylime.com, that outlines the fruit's provenance and explains how to grow your own key lime tree.</p>
        <p>Asked the secret of the perfect pie, Mr. Tarpin, who moved here from Florida, began to explain: ''Any self-respecting Miami native should know how to make a decent key lime pie. It's a basic recipe----'' He stopped short. ''I shouldn't tell you that,'' he said and, tongue-in-cheek, continued, ''It's a long family secret which we don't divulge.'' He did divulge the five simple ingredients: egg yolks, sweetened condensed milk and key limes for the filling; graham crackers and butter for the crust.</p>
        <p>Catering mostly to local restaurants and hotels, the company produces up to 120 large pies and 500 individual ones a day. Starting this month, the upscale grocery Citarella will be carrying his pies, which Mr. Tarpin hopes will afford him and his truck a little peace. ''So people won't actually have to chase me down the street to get a pie, which has been happening,'' he explained.</p>
        <p>INTERNATIONAL GOURMET DELIGHTS, BAY RIDGE -- Don't try to figure out how many generations Anwar Najjar's family has been in the pastry business. Back in the 11th century, when Crusaders and caravan merchants roamed the Near East, the Najjars were making the baklava that travelers carried to neighboring states and into the Arabian desert.</p>
        <p>Transporting their delicacies to Brooklyn was perhaps the next logical step.</p>
        <p>''My mom and dad came here in 1972,'' Mr. Najjar said as his sister and mother uncovered platters of Turkish delight, pistachios in filo dough, and shredded dough with walnuts in their wholesale bakery on Bay Ridge Avenue. Speaking of the Lebanese civil conflict, he said, ''In 1976 when the war broke out, they went back and got us in Tripoli.'' Thus did the business embark on its second millennium, combining ancient Lebanese techniques with an American-style melting-pot marketing philosophy.</p>
        <p>''We're halal and we're kosher,'' Mr. Najjar explained. ''We're also in Jewish communities; we're also in Israeli markets.'' They're also in South America, Asia and Canada, as well as in United States chain stores and Middle Eastern markets.</p>
        <p>Butter is a major component in the pastries, but so are more esoteric ingredients. Mastic gum, the sap of a special Grecian tree, gives the sugar-coated loukoum its chewy consistency; rose water provides an aromatic counterbalance to the nuts in the Turkish Delight.</p>
        <p>Badrieh Najjar, Mr. Najjar's mother, said local customers include transplants from traditional baklava-belt states like Pakistan, India, Greece, Iran and Yugoslavia. But in this era of rapid transit, even non-baklava countries are tuning in.</p>
        <p>''One time some Chinese person brought our product back to China and they wrote about it in their newspaper,'' she said, adding that the article specifically mentioned the bird's nest, a shredded dough specialty of the house. ''They loved the shape of it, they loved the taste of it, and they loved the name.''</p>
