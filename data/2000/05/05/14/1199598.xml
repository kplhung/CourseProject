        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As long as there are dedicated neonatologists and hopeful parents, premature babies with very low birthweights will be born (front page, May 8). Most of these babies will grow up with few, if any, long-term health problems. But many will have special health care needs of some kind.</p>
        <p>Instead of focusing on the implied question of the worth of a baby who survives low birthweight and has disabilities or a chronic health condition, we should turn our attention to two areas: healthy pregnancies and services for babies and children with special needs and their families.</p>

        <p>Instead of focusing on the implied question of the worth of a baby who survives low birthweight and has disabilities or a chronic health condition, we should turn our attention to two areas: healthy pregnancies and services for babies and children with special needs and their families.</p>
        <p>This country can certainly devote more resources to finding ways that women can carry out healthy pregnancies that result in babies born full term at robust weights. And all babies who survive low birthweight should be able to take part in developmental programs that provide them and their families a fighting chance.</p>
