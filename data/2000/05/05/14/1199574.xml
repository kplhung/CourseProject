        <p>Hot dog wrappers drifted by like tumbleweeds inside Comerica Park today, bouncing and hopping from right field to left. When fly balls went into the air, the players turned helplessly, as if caught in the whirl of dust devils.</p>
        <p>The Tigers are still learning about their new home, and it may be that the wind will never blow the same way it did on this spring afternoon -- steady, from the southwest and in over the right-field wall, curling along the upper decks of the park. If this is the norm, however, players will draw comparisons with Mother Nature's favorite haunt, San Francisco's Candlestick Park, where pop flies were an entertainment staple before the Giants escaped this spring.</p>
        <p>Detroit beat Andy Pettitte and the Yankees, 6-3, and would have done so with or without the wind. But first impressions are still being formed about Comerica Park, and on this first warm day game of the season, players on both sides waged war with the wind, some losing and others prevailing. ''I have never seen fly balls move like that,'' Yankees right fielder Paul O'Neill said.</p>
        <p>The Yankees, who have lost the first two games of this series to the last-place Tigers (11-23) and three straight over all, will try to salvage the final game Sunday, with David Cone set to face the former Mets pitcher Dave Mlicki. The Yankees are 22-12 and with nearly a quarter of the season completed, they are on a pace to win 105 games, but they continue to struggle to score runs, and to make plays.</p>
        <p>If Houston's cozy new Enron Field is the Rhode Island of ballparks, then Comerica Park is Alaska, an expanse of outfield so large that the outfielders must play a little deeper than they might in other parks. That dynamic was complicated by today's wind: Comerica Park is built into the ground and right field is mostly unguarded by structure, so that the breezes and gusts blew unencumbered into the outfield and wreaked havoc.</p>
        <p>Positioned deep in right field, O'Neill could not reach the bloop double Dean Palmer hit in the second; in most ballparks, O'Neill could have kept Palmer from reaching second. Three batters and one walk later, second baseman Jose Macias -- unknown to Pettitte before today's game -- rolled a grounder inside the first-base line, and by the time O'Neill retrieved it deep in the right-field corner, Macias had a two-run triple. Pettitte prolonged the inning with the second of his two throwing errors, and Detroit carried a 4-1 lead into the fourth inning.</p>
        <p>With two outs in the fourth, Palmer lifted a high pop toward right field. Pettitte began moving off the field, assuming this would be the last out. O'Neill set himself in right field, for what looked to be an easy play. The second baseman Chuck Knoblauch never moved.</p>
        <p>The ball suddenly dropped; it had hit the wall of wind blowing in from right field. ''It was like a duck that was shot and went right down,'' said Lee Mazzilli, the Yankees' first-base coach.</p>
        <p>And it fell about 100 feet from O'Neill, closer to Knoblauch than the right fielder. ''I had absolutely no chance,'' O'Neill said. ''I wouldn't have caught that ball even if you told me where it was going to drop. It's like it took off sideways.''</p>
        <p>Another run scored. O'Neill kept looking around in right field, staring at the fluttering flags high above the center-field wall, shaking his head. Pettitte was relieved two outs into the fifth inning, having allowed 6 runs on 10 hits and 3 walks -- a line almost identical to that of Roger Clemens in Friday's 9-7 loss (four and two-thirds innings, 10 hits, 6 runs, 5 walks).</p>
        <p>Bernie Williams hit a high fly toward left in the sixth inning and began sprinting toward first, knowing left fielder Rich Becker might be fooled by the wind. Becker moved in for a moment, started backpedaling, faster and faster, like someone playing in a company softball tournament, and the ball fell about five feet behind him. Williams was at second base, Becker was charged with an error -- mistakenly, Manager Joe Torre thought, given the adverse conditions.</p>
        <p>Ricky Ledee misread a fly ball in the fifth; infielders complained of the glare from the stands, the brightness of the field. But the most dramatic impact of the wind did not come until the top of the ninth inning, as the Tigers were finishing off the Yankees and a victory for Jeff Weaver  (1-4). Detroit's closer, Todd Jones, threw a high fastball to Scott Brosius, and Brosius popped up toward the right side. Brosius figured the ball would land about 10 rows into the stands behind the Yankees' dugout; Derek Jeter, watching from the Yankees' dugout on the first-base side, stepped from the railing, thinking the ball might land near him.</p>
        <p>But as the ball reached its apex, it began backtracking on a diagonal line. Catcher Brad Ausmus, who had moved toward the Yankees' dugout, began retreating, turned and ran toward third base -- then leaped and twisted like a diver, reaching and catching the ball before crash landing.</p>
        <p>The Yankees were all amazed at the catch, at the trajectory of the ball, the impact of the wind. Watching the flight of the ball, Brosius said later, ''I went from bitter to hopeful to bitter all in one pop-up.''</p>
        <p>This is Comerica Park. There's no place like home, Dorothy once said, and she lived in a pretty windy place, too.</p>
