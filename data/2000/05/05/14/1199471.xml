        <p>Life is a little easier for Bronx residents who recycle. After nearly four years of pickups every other week, people who had to store bottles, cans and other recyclables in their buildings and backyards, sometimes for weeks on end, have begun receiving weekly service.</p>
        <p>On April 10, the city expanded weekly pickups to 10 of the 12 sanitation districts in the borough.</p>
        <p>The frequency of pickups has been an issue since 1996, when weekly collections were discontinued in most of the city's 59 sanitation districts due to cuts in the municipal budget. In December 1998, the City Council ordered weekly pickups restored citywide but gave the city until April 15, 2000, to comply. The 10 Bronx districts regained service just a few days before the deadline.</p>
        <p>''Weekly pickups mean a lot,'' said D. Lee Ezell, chairman of the municipal services committee of Community Board 4.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ezell lives on Teller Avenue, a tree-lined street in Morrisania where privately owned homes face tidy front yards, and porches are for sitting, not for storing garbage. Frequently, recyclable trash ended up mixed with regular garbage, piled high against telephone poles or overflowing in bins on the street.</p>
        <p>''Before, there were rats and dogs chewing at the bags, spreading garbage everywhere,'' Ms. Ezell said of the period before weekly pickups resumed. ''It was a health hazard.''</p>
        <p>The lack of weekly pickups presented another problem. Residents who tried to comply with the law often held on to recyclable material for up to a month. Because the pileups attracted bugs and looked unsightly, some residents stopped recycling and were fined for breaking the law.</p>
        <p>Robert Lange, director of the Department of Sanitation's Bureau of Waste Prevention, Reuse and Recycling, said weekly pickups were originally discontinued throughout most of the city because sanitation trucks were coming back half full.</p>
        <p>''Half full just isn't efficient,'' Mr. Lange said. ''From a cost standpoint, you're collecting much less garbage on a weekly schedule than on a biweekly one.''</p>
