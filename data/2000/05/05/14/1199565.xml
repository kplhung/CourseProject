        <p>Detectives have arrested a man who, they said, shot his estranged girlfriend in the face and then shot and killed her 79-year-old grandmother as she slept in her bed in her Harlem apartment.</p>
        <p>Six children under the age of 7 were in the apartment at the time of the shootings, but none were injured, the police said.</p>
        <p>The police said yesterday that the man, Robert Lango, 27, of 455 Jackson Avenue, the Bronx, was charged with second-degree murder, attempted murder and weapons possession in the shootings Friday morning in an apartment at 2430 Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard, in the Drew Patterson Houses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lango's girlfriend, Kenia Martin, 22, who had been living with him, was staying with her grandmother,  Ella Mae Martin, in the Harlem apartment because the couple had been fighting, the police said. Mr. Lango had become enraged because the younger Ms. Martin would not give him a set of keys to the apartment they shared, said Capt. Ronald Facciponti, a detectives supervisor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lango came to the Harlem apartment about 9:25 a.m. Friday, knocked on the door and shot Kenia Martin in the face when she opened it, the police said. He then walked to the bedroom, where Ella Mae Martin was sleeping, shot her once in the head and ran downstairs and out the back door, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>Kenia Martin, who has three young children, two with Mr. Lango, was in serious but stable condition at Harlem Hospital Center yesterday, the police said. The children were in the care of the city's Administration for Children's Services.</p>
        <p>Detectives found a Lorcin .25-caliber semiautomatic pistol in the building's trash compactor, the police said. Ballistics tests were being done to determine whether it was the gun used in the shootings.</p>
        <p>According to police records, there had been three incidents of domestic violence involving Mr. Lango and Ms. Martin at the Jackson Avenue apartment they shared since 1999, Captain Facciponti said. In 1998, Ms. Martin took out an order of protection against Mr. Lango, but it had expired, the captain said.</p>
