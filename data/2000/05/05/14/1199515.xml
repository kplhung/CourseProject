      <abstract>
        <p>Tom Bernardin letter on April 30 article about bicycle helmets, which failed to address issue of bicyclists who ride on New York City sidewalks (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Nowhere in the article ''Using a Bicycle Helmet, and the Head Inside'' (April 30) is there a mention of the responsibilities of bicyclists to follow the laws of the road. I refer specifically to the law against bicycling on sidewalks. Of the 10 Web sites listed, only one, Transportation Alternatives (www.transalt.org), has a copy of the law.</p>
        <p>As a former avid city bicyclist, I lost my taste for bicycling the moment I was hit by a wrong-way messenger and thrown into Sixth Avenue traffic. Now my pedestrian enjoyment is threatened by the increasing number of sidewalk bicyclists. Bicyclists must make claim to their share of the roadway, but not at the expense of those on the sidewalks.  Pedestrians come in all stripes:  young and old, infirm and agile.  Some are pushing baby carriages, pregnant, hard-of-hearing, site-impaired or walking dogs.</p>

        <p>Until officials involved issue a drop-dead moratorium on bicycling on sidewalks we are all subject the abuse of irresponsible bicyclists.  Perhaps the example of the pooper-scooper law of a few years ago should be copied. A committed effort of the mayor, the news media and the police solved that problem virtually overnight.</p>
