        <p>Blame the Windsors, but most of us would agree that Prince Charming is out the door, if not utterly discredited. So what's a fairy tale princess to do, except step aside or achieve her own deliverance? These are the choices presented in two new novels by widely admired writers. One upends Cinderella to create a vehicle for satire; the other starts off with Sleeping Beauty but trades archetype for an elaborately articulated fantasy.</p>
        <p>Philip Pullman's tale is fast and clever, his most obviously comical writing to date. ''I was a rat,'' says the odd boy who shows up on the doorstep of faithful old Joan the washerwoman and her husband, old Bob the shoemaker, and it won't take readers long to figure out that he is telling the truth. Roger (as childless Joan and Bob name him) is one of the rats-turned-pageboys who escorted a mysterious bewitching maiden to the prince's ball. Nor will it take long to figure out who the real rats are. Pullman's London is peopled by types who would be at home in Dickens: heartless bureaucrats and brutal schoolteachers, blinkered philosophers and freak-show impresarios, rings of boy thieves.</p>
        <p>Roger's misadventures as he loses sight of Bob and Joan and passes through these villains' clutches are emphatically punctuated with excerpts from The Daily Scourge, a tabloid that sensationalizes with alacrity. At first The Scourge describes the royal romance kindled at the Midsummer Ball: ''Hunky Prince Richard has found a bride at last!'' (In an example of Pullman's sly cynicism, the item includes this paragraph: ''Prince Richard -- the lover: A fact file of the playboy prince's previous girlfriends, pages 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.'') Then The Scourge begins to report on a ''monster of the sewers,'' clearly Roger, and whips up a mindless public's demand for his execution. The satire grows ever broader, culminating in pointed parallels between the Cinderella stand-in, Princess Aurelia, and Princess Diana. Acclaimed in the end a ''fairy tale princess'' by The Scourge (''Special feature: Princess Aurelia's favorite charities, pp. 20-21. Interview with Princess Aurelia's hairdresser, p. 22''), she privately longs for her old, untransformed self.</p>
        <p>For all its indictments, ''I Was a Rat!'' can't help being cheerful, and laughter is never far away. There are puns, hoary even to child readers; bits of slapstick; and plenty of wit in the exaggerations. If this seems a finger exercise from Pullman, or a diversion from his more ambitious trilogy ''His Dark Materials'' (the story begun in ''The Golden Compass'' and ''The Subtle Knife'' awaits completion), it's a pleasing one.</p>
        <p>Robin McKinley's ''Spindle's End,'' on the other hand, is often brilliant but also maddening at times. The author, who won a Newbery Medal for her fantasy ''The Hero and the Crown,'' succeeds in turning the story of Sleeping Beauty into something literal -- in other words, she makes its magic an everyday affair, so that the tale of the cursed princess unfolds as if it were realistic.</p>
        <p>Her long, long novel opens with a leisurely second-person overview of the setting, painstakingly describing problems of fairy housekeeping and general relations between fairies and humans. The details set forth are just that: details, not elements that will later figure in the plot. McKinley's sentences are syntactically complex, entwined with parenthetical asides, and the vocabulary is conspicuously challenging -- dense and twisty, the prose is not unlike the thorny brier roses that traditionally spring up around the princess' castle after its inhabitants fall into enchanted sleep. From these thickets characters emerge only gradually; indeed, the first key figure, Katriona, a young apprentice fairy, does not make her first appearance for more than 20 pages.</p>
        <p>The deliberate pacing and the steadfast pleasure in digression make this a book that readers will either love or loathe. The sumptuous world of the story takes precedence over the story line, even though the story line departs radically from its model. This Sleeping Beauty does not sleep, and the curse of death laid upon her is never mitigated. The author insists that her heroine play an active part in her own salvation -- not for McKinley a hundred years' slumber ended by a kiss from a handsome prince.</p>
        <p>What lies dormant is the princess' knowledge of her identity. Here the newly cursed infant princess magically receives a foster mother in the fairy Katriona, who with her aunt raises the princess in a backwater village and lets her be known as Rosie (after Briar-Rose, the last of her 21 names). All the while Rosie is sought by the evil fairy Pernicia, who has demanded her death (and upped the stakes by refusing to fix a date for the princess' doom). Covering their tracks, Katriona and Aunt (as she is known) let Rosie grow up believing herself Katriona's orphan cousin.</p>
        <p>Rosie is as unprincesslike as McKinley can make her. Neither pretty nor graceful nor naturally kind like her best friend, the suspiciously named Peony, Rosie aspires to be a veterinarian and is happiest in the company of animals, especially because they can speak with her. When she at last is awakened to the truth, it is a horror.</p>
        <p>The bold use of paradox startles readers into a reappraisal of fairy tale conventions, even if McKinley's resolution isn't as well fleshed out as her setting. The plot seems to go back and forth, and then to race a little wildly. The showdown between Rosie and Pernicia, for example, involves a great deal of sudden magic that depends at least as much on force as on wits, more like a battle of superheroes than the climax of a carefully planned novel. By the end, however, when McKinley openly flouts the rules of fairy tales, she has made her conclusion seem inevitable, the outcome her heroines and heroes most deserve.</p>
        <p>Italo Calvino, in introducing his collection ''Italian Folktales,'' quotes a Tuscan proverb: ''The tale is not beautiful if nothing is added to it.'' With these two novels, the question becomes, how much can a writer take away?</p>
