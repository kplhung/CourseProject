        <p>To the Editor: My mom and I read ''Losing Track of the Centuries'' by Rachel L. Swarns (April 2). I am in the fifth grade and my mom thinks I need to know Africa because I'm Sahrawi-American. After spending time with my nomadic relatives in Western Sahara and with Tuareg nomads in Mali, she thought I should see another part of Africa with great deserts, Namibia.</p>
        <p>When we traveled to Namibia in December 1998, we visited my nomadic brothers the Himba at a camp about an hour from Epupa Falls. Because my dad is a Sahrawi tribal chief (and I'm going to be a chief when I grow up), I wore my traditional clothes to greet them. But I still wore my Oakley sunglasses.</p>

        <p>With a stick I drew a picture of Africa in the sand and showed the Himba where Western Sahara is compared with Namibia. I told them it would take about a year to get there walking. I don't know if they understood me, but I think we had a real nice visit because we respected each other. I bought some cool necklaces for my friends from the Himba, too.</p>
        <p>I liked Namibia so much that my mom and I returned there to celebrate the millennium. I just wish more kids in the world could meet each other as brothers.</p>
