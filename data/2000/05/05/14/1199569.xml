        <p>Twenty barrels of potassium cyanide that were stolen earlier this month from a New Jersey warehouse were found yesterday afternoon in the underbrush along a residential street in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>The discovery of the highly poisonous chemicals prompted the authorities to evacuate about 70 homes as a precaution.</p>
        <p>Before removing the steel barrels, which were the size of beer kegs, emergency crews from the Police and Fire Departments, clad head-to-toe in baggy protective biohazard suits, and a city chemist examined them and tested the air around them to make sure that none had broken open. Then they were loaded into a truck from the Radiac Research Corporation, which operates a chemical warehouse in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>The orange-and-white barrels were found about 12:20 p.m. along Pugsley Avenue in the Clason Point section of the Bronx after an anonymous caller, possibly alerted by news reports about the stolen chemicals, telephoned the police emergency number, the authorities said. The barrels had been dumped in an area of heavy underbrush next to a baseball field, across the street from a row of attached duplex houses.</p>
        <p>The barrels, along with some perfume and flavoring additives, were inside a tractor-trailer that was stolen from the Magic Transport Inc. warehouse in Linden, N.J., on May 3, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The potassium cyanide, which has a common industrial use in electroplating, was to be sent by ship to Puerto Rico, the authorities said. The empty trailer, without its cab, was found Friday night in an industrial area in the Long Island City section of Queens.</p>
        <p>While the World Health Organization has said potassium cyanide can be used as a chemical weapon by terrorists, the police and the F.B.I. said they believe that the crime was nothing more than a simple truck theft.</p>
        <p>Richard J. Sheirer, director of the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management, said officials presumed, based on the way the barrels were dumped, that the thieves ''had no idea what they were taking.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sheirer said the residents of about 70 homes were evacuated shortly after the chemicals were found. All were back in their homes by about 4:30 p.m., he said.</p>
        <p>''My job is to err on the side of safety, so I had the team -- that was police and fire and a chemist from the Department of Environmental Protection -- we had them suit up to make sure that they and the public were protected,'' Mr. Sheirer said.</p>
        <p>But the flurry of activity along normally quiet Pugsley Avenue, a broad thoroughfare that was choked with emergency vehicles, frightened some residents.</p>
        <p>''It's a little scary,'' said Latoya Brown, 20, who lives at 540 Pugsley Avenue, directly across the street from the site where the chemicals were found. ''You don't know what else is being dumped out here.''</p>
