        <p>THE idea of a big backyard is well understood in the New Jersey art world. An artist can be local all over the state.</p>
        <p>Names and styles get around, at least in part, owing to the practice of rotating the fine arts and crafts biennials among the state's major museums. Along with this boosterism is a sense of community responsibility.</p>
        <p>This aspect of sharing is emphasized this summer at the Printmaking Council of New Jersey in Somerville. ''Preserving the Garden: Saving New Jersey Landscape'' is an exhibition with the not very romantic theme of environmental protection. It was conceived in response to the state's recent commitment to preserve a million acres of open space.</p>
        <p>The art itself, though, is not didactic; much of it might be called dire whimsy. It includes Michael Ast's photograph of a red barn in a verdant setting -- but with a housing development that seems to be moving in like an army. This is a photograph of an actual scene; however, Robert Wugsted and Alexandra Searld constructed their vision -- rubber tires packed close together and advancing through a field -- before they photographed it. They titled their piece ''Proposed Path of Road.''</p>
        <p>An exhibition at the New Jersey Center for Visual Arts in Summit is a reminder of one reason the environment is a big issue; it can ultimately give pleasure. One of the most durable claims for art is stated simply: art provides a window onto the world.</p>
        <p>''On the Horizon: Landscape at the Millennium,'' provides many such windows. More often than not, the views seem familiar. Although none is specifically titled as such, many of the works might be New Jersey scenes.</p>
        <p>Paul Waldman's panoramic ''Twilight' is simply layering: a green field topped by one of darkening blue sky mottled with clouds; a patch of yellow is at the horizon.</p>
        <p>Janet Culbertson's ''Overview'' affords a view onto another field at sunset, but it's as though we're viewing the scene through a hole in a gritty surface covering most of the canvas reminiscent of a stone wall.</p>
        <p>Acknowledging the new century are novel forms of landscape. Alison Moritsugu has painted a verdant Hudson River School-style vignette on the smooth face of a log that has been sliced. The roughness of the remaining bark is in marked contrast to the bucolic scene.</p>
        <p>The show includes landscape sculpture, and Michael Ashkin's is especially bleak; a couple of miniature truck trailers sit near a pile of rocks standing in murky water. The show's curators write in the catalog that it mirrors what might be seen along sections of the New Jersey Turnpike.</p>
        <p>The Princeton University Art Gallery is also emphasizing environmental and preservation themes, along with a sense of landscape that surrounds.</p>
        <p>A Boston photographer, Barbara Bosworth, achieves a sense of sweeping expanse by exposing three or four large negatives on a single sheet of photographic paper. Her major subjects can be seen as opposites: hunters, and on the other hand, trees that have been identified as the largest of their species by the American Forestry Association.</p>
        <p>Walt Whitman, who wound up his life in the state, boasted that he was proud of frequently contradicting himself. Along with the plainspokenness and sense of responsibility that characterizes the New Jersey art world is a wide streak of idiosyncracy. Robert Forman is the mastermind of ''Narratives in Thread'' at the Hunterdon Museum of Art in Clinton. Mr. Forman captures his viewers by first grounding them in something familiar and domestic -- sewing -- or rather a novel variation of this craft.</p>
        <p>Mr. Forman makes his ''paintings'' by placing threads of different colors and thickness next to each other on a flat surface. It's a technique derived from one used by the Huichol Indians of northern Mexico whom he visited on several occasions. The Huichol make their paintings by imbedding yarn on a wax-covered surface, and their imagery is symbols that are important to their culture, such as deer, the sun and peyote flowers that are often represented abstractly. Mr. Forman's complex and detailed works are shown with some bold yarn works made by his mentors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Forman, a native of Jersey City who now lives in Hoboken, creates shimmering paintings of what's close to him, personally. While he imports the exotic into his work in his technique, he hones his image as a local guy. His paintings including self portraits and a family history. He has reproduced the interior of his loft.</p>
        <p>THE art scene in New Jersey wouldn't be as dynamic as it is if it didn't run deep. A sense of community has developed over the years at a former tobacco warehouse in Jersey City, at 111 First Street, which was converted into a building full of studios along with a few enterprising galleries.</p>
        <p>For several years Bill Barrell ran the Shoestring Gallery, in the building, showing the work of local artists.</p>
        <p>Now it is the turn of Mr. Barrell, who is mainly a painter, to be on the showing end. The Chamot Gallery at 111 is giving him what he calls a 40-year retrospective, grandly titled ''From Pop to the Millennium.''</p>
        <p>A major, consistent thread of his art is the comings and goings of his daily life, as in a painting called ''Daddy's Home.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Barrell's style, which runs the gamut from lyricism to chaos is thoroughly grounded in Picasso and Matisse as well as Red Grooms, and his personal additions include sunniness, whimsy and sense of social satire; he has done a whole show of trompe l'oeil potholes and mad cows.</p>
        <p>It takes someone of great range and depth to dare to serve up such a big meal in August.</p>
