        <p>Fourteen years after the worst accident in the history of nuclear power, Ukraine seems determined to shut down the lone active reactor remaining at Chernobyl by the end of the year. The long overdue decision will close a reactor that has experienced an unsettling variety of minor failures and end power generation at a complex that once contained four nuclear plants. But in other ways the Chernobyl accident still haunts the people and lands of the former Soviet Union. The steel and concrete shell encasing the radioactive ruins of the destroyed reactor is leaking and must be replaced.</p>
        <p>Reactors with similar designs to those at Chernobyl -- and considerable safety problems -- still operate in Russia and Lithuania. Several countries in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union depend on other types of Soviet-built reactors that also fall short of Western safety standards. These are expensive problems, requiring money that former Soviet bloc nations do not have. The West has provided millions in financial assistance, but it will have to contribute more to improve nuclear safety and close dangerous reactors.</p>
        <p>The sarcophagus that houses the No. 4 reactor at Chernobyl, the one that exploded in April 1986, is unstable and cracked. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development is trying to raise $768 million to reseal the tomb temporarily and to build a new one. So far, the United States and European nations have given only about half that amount. When donor nations meet in Berlin this summer, they must pledge to pay the balance.</p>
        <p>A second need is to continue to care for those affected by the Chernobyl disaster. The greatest problem is thyroid cancer in people who were children at the time of the accident. Most of the 2,000 victims so far live in Belarus and are being treated with help from the World Health Organization.</p>
        <p>In 1992, the Group of Seven industrialized nations recommended the closure of 25 Soviet-designed reactors, including all Chernobyl-style power plants. These reactors -- there are 14 today -- are considered the most dangerous. Though they have been upgraded to fix the flaws that contributed to the Chernobyl disaster, they remain unsafe. The 43 other Soviet-design reactors in use are considered somewhat safer, but all need more backup systems and other protective measures. The poverty of former Soviet nations adds to the risk. At Chernobyl, for example, maintenance is slighted and employees have often had to wait months for their paychecks.</p>
        <p>The desire to join the European Union has encouraged Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria to try to meet European safety standards by scheduling early closing of their most dangerous reactors. It is no small sacrifice for a poor nation to shut down a source of cheap energy. Lithuania, for example, is planning to close one of its two reactors, which together provide 75 percent of the country's power.</p>
        <p>The industrialized nations have been talking about helping Ukraine to close Chernobyl for years. Their aid will take the form of loans to complete two new nuclear reactors -- a bad idea, as the reactors will not meet Western safety standards. The safer, if costlier, choice would be to build a coal plant and improve the energy efficiency of existing factories. Few catastrophes have less respect for borders than a nuclear meltdown. Unsafe reactors are an international problem, and decommissioning requires international cooperation.</p>
