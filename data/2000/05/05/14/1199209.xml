        <p>Critics of Gates's aid to the United Negro College Fund are more than a little off base in assuming that any type of educational aid to minority groups is about some form of affirmative action. Many minority students, myself included, who are accepted into Ivy League schools (which typically serve as springboards to a brighter future) simply cannot afford to go. There are few scholarships that cover four-year tuitions in excess of $25,000.</p>
