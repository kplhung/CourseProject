        <p>After Furor Over Book, A Welcome Epilogue</p>
        <p>The obvious question: in her cheerful new life as a teacher at a Queens school with students from 40 cultures, does Ruth Sherman, known for teaching a book called ''Nappy Hair'' to a class in Brooklyn, still use the book? Do her new students learn about the little girl with ''the nappiest, the fuzziest, the most screwed up, squeezed up, knotted up'' hair in the world? Or did the threats from parents that caused the white teacher to change schools keep her from teaching what she had hoped would be a diversity-affirming book?</p>
        <p>Well, Ms. Sherman, 29, does not teach the book by Carolivia Herron that caused such controversy back in 1998. Not yet, at least.</p>
        <p>''That's not because I have anything against it,'' she said, adding that the book is still in her library. ''I haven't gotten a chance to do a unit like that yet.''</p>
        <p>Some parents at Public School 75 in Bushwick objected to her use of the book, and, calling her a racist, threatened her.</p>
        <p>In her new school, Ms. Sherman, who got married in the meantime and enjoys the relative anonymity of her new name, has not looked into teaching other books that might ruffle feathers. ''I do second-guess everything now,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The controversy also affected her teaching style. ''I was extremely open-minded before, and I'd look through a child's eyes. Now I think, 'This one might be insulted, this one has a little bit of an attitude about this,' '' she said. ''Something as simple as a child's book might offend someone, which is something I never thought about before. It is a learning experience.</p>
        <p>''Now, I will do anything in my power not to insult or disrespect anybody.''</p>
        <p>Her new school in Jamaica Estates feels like home now. ''I joke around all the time, I want a T-shirt that says 'I died and went to P.S. 131,' '' she said. ''It's heaven here.''</p>
        <p>New Strategy in Game Of Duck, Duck, Goose</p>
        <p>They've tried shaking them. They've tried baking them. They've tried spraying the home fields with goose-repelling grape juice. Now, they've added three border collies with a fervent work ethic. And still, it's a dead heat in the continuing battle of Canada Geese vs. the People of Clarkstown.</p>
        <p>For a while there, the score was tilted in favor of the People, in their attempts to rid their grassy areas of goose droppings. In 1996 and 1997, Clarkstown, in Rockland County, got permission from the state to round up a total of 451 geese and convert them to gooseburgers for the homeless and elderly. But in 1996, the meat was contaminated, and in 1997, the elderly complained that it was tough. In all, the plan wasn't worth the hassle. It reduced the number of nests in the parks, but it brought out animal rights demonstrators, and people complained that new geese would move in to replace the cooked ones.</p>
        <p>The town is now resorting to an earlier goose-fighting technique, addling eggs by shaking them and piercing them, so they will not hatch. And now, dogs belonging to Mary Felegy of Fair Game Goose Management Services patrol the town's parks daily, running and swimming after the birds.</p>
        <p>There is less ''goose grease'' in the parks, said Charles Holbrook, the Clarkstown supervisor. ''The dogs keep the geese off the park property, which is good, but in reality they're just chasing them to someone else's property, so it's not really a solution,'' he said. And it costs $36,000 to chase the geese, but only $10,000 to catch them and prepare the meat, he added.</p>
        <p>But Ms. Felegy said the parks were cleaner now. ''It's safe to sit on the grass,'' she said, ''it's safe to slide into home base, and you can bounce your basketball on the court without it coming up covered in green, slimy goo.''</p>
