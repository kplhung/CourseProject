        <p>Young people didn't waste a minute flinging themselves into summer looks to accommodate the August-like weather a week ago. Midriffs and tattoos were exposed, jeans' outer seams were slashed open to cool legs, and inner seams were cut to turn jeans into skirts, with a gusset of flower-print fabric. Other skirts showed eclectic lengths, and young men's droopy pants continued to sag. A metallic jersey tube dress had the sides opened up almost to the armpits, with dipping pointed panels front and back. Could this be the new T-shirt? And could the scooter be fashion's new accessory?</p>
