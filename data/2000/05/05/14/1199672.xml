        <p>STORY by Truffant. Screenplay and direction by Godar. Starring, as Bosley Crowther wrote in his 1961 New York Times review, ''a hypnotically ugly new young man'': Jean-Paul Belmondo, age 26. What more could a French New Wave fan want than BREATHLESS (1959)? Only Jean Seberg as the expatriate American girlfriend, who makes hawking The Herald Tribune on the streets of Paris look like a glamour job. Belmondo's character, a small-time thief on the run after having casually killed a policeman, may not be shocking in his amorality these decades later, but he's still disturbing, as is Seberg's - Sunday at 3 p.m. on AMC.</p>

Only Jean Seberg as the expatriate American girlfriend, who makes hawking The Herald Tribune on the streets of Paris look like a glamour job. Belmondo's character, a small-time thief on the run after having casually killed a policeman, may not be shocking in his amorality these decades later, but he's still disturbing, as is Seberg's - Sunday at 3 p.m. on AMC.</p>
        <p>Jeremy Irons has had many fine moments on film, and one exchange with Ron Silver in Barbet Schroeder's REVERSAL OF FORTUNE (1990) has to rank high among them. Mr. Silver (excellent as the lawyer Alan Dershowitz), seeing Mr. Irons (as Calus von Bulow) to his car, genially accuses him of being a little strange. Mr. Irons raises an eyebrow ever so slightly and, sliding into the back seat, replies, ''You have no idea.'' Oh, those wacky rich people! Mr. Irons won and deserved the best actor Oscar that year. Glenn Close is also outstanding as Sunny, his troubled wife, whose coma he may or may not have induced. That's why he's on trial - Sunday at 5 p.m. on Channel 55.</p>
        <p>Arnold Schwarzenegger is the action star of James Cameron's TRUE LIES (1994), and he's good, but Jamie Lee Curtis is the reason to watch. Mr. Schwarzenegger plays a James Bond-style international agent (who has killed people, yes, but ''they were all bad''), and Ms. Curtis is his mousy wife, who thinks he's a computer salesman who takes a lot of business trips. As she comes to understand the truth, she blossoms, to say the least. There should be an award for best beauty and sex appeal makeover performed without special effects in a hotel hallway - Thursday at 8 p.m. on Channel 5.</p>
        <p>Christopher Reeve was an unknown when Richard Donner's SUPERMAN (1978) was released, but he was an instant superhero. And his charm was that he played Clark Kent with just as much conviction as Kent's Krypton-born alter ego. Margot Kidder's Lois Lane is hard-nosed and ambitious, but her flight with Superman over Manhattan's skyline is pure old-fashioned romance - Thursday at 8 p.m., Thursday/Early Friday at 2 a.m. on AMC.</p>
        <p>''You won't find anything cheap around here,'' says Lana Turner to John Garfield early in Tay Garnett's version of James M. Cain's novel THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE (9146). Who is she kidding? This fabulous melo-drama - about a beautiful young blonde in a passionless marriage, a sexy drifter who comes to stay, the murder they commit in the name of their adulterous affair and the Dostoy-evskian consequences - is all about the dangers of taking the cheap way out. Despite the sexual censorhsip of the time, Turner and Garfield sizzle - Saturday at 8 p.m. on TCM.</p>
        <p>Movie fans may ridicule Doris Day's virgin-on-the-defensive period now, but Michael Gordon's PILLOW TALK (1959) is sparkling from beginning to end. Rock Hudson, of course, plays the womanizing bachelor-about-town whom Ms. Day's designer-dressed interior-decorator character hates (but she knows only his name and his voice, because they share a telephone party line). He carefully seduces her by pretending to be someone nicer, an innocent Texas boy just looking for warmth and reassurance - Saturday at 10 p.m. on the Family Channel.</p>
