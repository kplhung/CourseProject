        <p>SAMMY MALDONADO of Harrison High School may move from the Westchester County high school football spotlight to the national college spotlight as quickly as he changes direction when a hole is blocked.</p>
        <p>In March, the running back's declaration of intention to attend Ohio State University in Columbus on an athletic scholarship became binding. Next month, he will join the New York high school stars training to play their New Jersey counterparts in the third annual Governors' Bowl at West Point on July 7. By late July, he will be in his first college football camp. Come September, Maldonado could be the focal point of the nationally ranked Buckeyes' offense.</p>
        <p>''We try not to take young men as projects,'' Tim Spencer, Ohio State's running backs coach, said. ''If Sammy can grasp our offense in camp and comes to play, he has a chance of playing as a freshman.''</p>
        <p>Maldonado, who was in Columbus two weekends ago to watch the annual Ohio State spring scrimmage, came away with the same impression.</p>
        <p>''They told me I'd have a chance if I do what I'm supposed to,'' he said the other day. ''And after watching the scrimmage out there, I think I fit perfectly with their offense.''</p>
        <p>He continued: ''I'm willing to rise to the challenge. Pressure really doesn't affect me.''</p>
        <p>Maldonado will take awesome high school statistics with him to Ohio State. He rushed for 7,581 yards during his career -- only the second runner in the state to surpass 7,000 yards -- led the Harrison Huskies to an undefeated season and the Class B state championship and became the first New York player to win two high school Heismans. His 99 touchdowns set a state record and, just as amazing, he scored 15 more that were called back by penalties.</p>
        <p>And he has picked the perfect school. Ohio State, where the old Woody Hayes teams ran the famed ''three yards and a cloud of dust'' offenses, still leads with the running game and plays its home games on natural grass, reducing the chance of injury when cutting. Further, the Buckeyes have no outstanding returning runner, just three good ones, shallow by their standards at the crucial tailback position.</p>
        <p>''Sammy fits our needs perfectly,'' said Spencer, who carried the ball for the Buckeyes from 1979 to '82. ''He's big, tough and has the ability to make you miss. We really like his toughness, and he appears eager to learn. These guys are easy to coach.''</p>
        <p>Especially since Maldonado is equally comfortable going straight up the middle, running off tackle, going outside or switching direction. ''It doesn't matter to me,'' he said, ''as long as I have good people in front of me.''</p>
        <p>The 6-foot-1, 220-pound Maldonado will again be in a run-first offense. ''We've always been known to have big running backs,'' Spencer said. ''But now we're a little more sophisticated than three-yards-and-a-cloud-of-dust. And Sammy has very good quickness as well as power.</p>
        <p>''I didn't have to watch him on a whole lot of plays to know he was for us. Hey, this is a no-brainer.''</p>
        <p>It also brings some peace to the Maldonado family, which moved to Harrison from the South Bronx in 1982 to give their children a better education.</p>
        <p>With the youngest of Rafael and Nereyda Maldonado's three sons the most sought after running back in the country, their phone was constantly busy and their mailman was worried about a hernia.</p>
        <p>''I didn't care,'' Rafael Maldonado said. ''I was so proud.''</p>
        <p>His wife said: ''So many calls and letters.  Sometimes Sammy would say, 'Momma, don't they know I have to study?' ''</p>
        <p>Now Sammy Maldonado can study, and prepare.</p>
        <p>''I really feel good about picking Ohio State,'' he said. ''It already feels like home.''</p>
        <p>FOR THE RECORD</p>
