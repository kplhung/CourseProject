        <p>IMAGINE: You are in the middle of a room. It appears to be a classroom. The classroom is filled with people, all staring at you. You are completely naked.</p>
        <p>Anxiety dream? For most of the population, yes. But for a small group of men and women, that scenario is not only reality, it is also all in a day's work.</p>
        <p>They are professional artists' models who pose for art students and professional artists in studios, college classrooms and community centers all over Westchester County. The work is challenging, physically as well as mentally, and the models take pride in doing it well.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the biggest challenge, at least at first, is taking off their clothes.</p>
        <p>Roxanne Seitz, 49, of White Plains, said: ''A lot of us aren't career nudists. We're artists who didn't want a 9-to-5 corporate job.'' Ms. Seitz is one of several models who poses for Roger Hendricks's painting classes at Purchase College and who agreed to be interviewed.</p>
        <p>An artist and musician, Ms. Seitz has been modeling since last June. ''I tried it a couple of times about 10 years ago, but I felt too vulnerable,'' she recalled. ''Then I tried it again for a portrait class and recognized the freedom it brought me. I can put in as much or as little as I want, and I like being around other artists.''</p>
        <p>She also enjoyed conquering her fears: ''I marveled at the guts, moxie, courage, chutzpah it required. It took me a while to think it might serve my needs, but it does serve a lot of them.''</p>
        <p>For Ms. Seitz and for the others interviewed, the fee of $15 an hour is the primary motivation, but not the only one. Angela Carrozza, 28, of Mount Kisco, started modeling four years ago after she lost 57 pounds. ''I found it very liberating,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''I grew up with a weight problem and once I got the weight off, I found modeling disciplined me and made me feel good about myself,'' she continued. ''I had been working in the book publishing world and was overwhelmed by it. Now modeling supports my writing.''</p>
        <p>Nancy Jane Blake, 42, of Ossining, entered the profession almost by accident. ''I was a visual arts major here at Purchase,'' she explained. ''Then one day when I was 19 or 20, I was in a figure-drawing class and the model didn't show up. The instructor asked if anyone would be willing to take her place. And in an incredible spurt of courage, I took it off in front of my classmates.'' Her first experience was terrifying. ''It was the dead of winter and everyone else was bundled up,'' she recalled. ''I was so nervous the sweat just poured out of me.''</p>
        <p>Then Ms. Blake, an amateur actress as well as an artist, realized that modeling suited her. ''Being an actress and an art student both contributed to my being a good model: I'm totally at ease being the focus of a whole room. I can remember thinking, I'm in my element. And as an art student, I know what they're looking for.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Blake now models in the winter and spends spring, summer and fall gardening for a landscape designer -- ''It's very physical and keeps me in shape.''</p>
        <p>Keeping in shape is important, not so much to fulfill a certain standard of beauty -- all shapes and sizes are welcome as artists' models -- but because the work is so physically demanding. Classes typically last from three to four hours, and models pose for 20 or 25 minutes before taking a break. For painting classes, they may have to maintain the same pose for three or four sessions. Drawing classes, the models say, are easier and more fun because the poses are shorter -- from 2 to 20 minutes; as a result, models can assume positions that would be unsustainable for long periods.</p>
        <p>''I try not to cross my legs for long poses,'' said Richard C., a 55-year-old White Plains model and freelance writer. ''By the end of the third hour it's not unusual for my foot to go to sleep so badly that it takes a couple of minutes to get the pins and needles out before I can even stand up. I also try to avoid doing standing poses for more than 10 minutes.''</p>
        <p>Besides enduring discomfort, the models have to train themselves to remain motionless.</p>
        <p>''The killer is time dragging along,'' Richard C. explained. ''I try to think of anything but the time -- sports, something I'm writing or even my income taxes. Otherwise it'll seem like forever.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Seitz meditates. Ms. Blake confessed that by the last hour of a class she has food fantasies -- ''I think about what I want to eat when I get home.''</p>
        <p>None of their mental techniques can alleviate muscle fatigue. Ms. Carrozza, who models from 35 to 40 hours a week, uses two massage therapists and a chiropracter. Ms. Seitz has taken up rolfing, a system of deep massage many dancers and athletes use for both physical and emotional therapy.</p>
        <p>Cold rooms are another problem.</p>
        <p>''One artist told me, 'It's too hard to paint goosebumps, I'll have to get another space heater,' '' Ms. Carrozza recalled.</p>
        <p>But even two space heaters cannot always combat the chill in winter or excessive air-conditioning in summer. Ms. Seitz has a few ideas about how to make the work environment in art classes better. ''I'm thinking of writing a models' manifesto,'' she said.</p>
        <p>It would include a protected space that would preclude workmen coming in during class. And she would require window coverings that would conceal the models from the view of passers-by.</p>
        <p>The models' vulnerability extends beyond the classes. Several have received calls purportedly about jobs that turned out to be from cranks interested in getting them to talk about their bodies.</p>
        <p>''You live and learn,'' said Ms. Carrozza, who no longer allows her phone number to be posted at art schools and who further protects her privacy by refusing to allow her photograph to be taken. Photographs are sometimes used when instructors want to record a pose for subsequent sessions. If a photograph seems really necessary, she and other models try to hold on to it themselves  between classes.</p>
        <p>In general, the models are philosophical about the job's occupational hazards and focus on their pleasure in seeing themselves depicted by artists, even sometimes when they cannot recognize themselves -- or indeed, any human at all.</p>
        <p>''We are all glad to be their muses,'' Ms. Seitz said. ''And in addition, their interpretations enrich my understanding of myself.  One of my first assignments was a sculpting class, and one sculptor was even looking up my nose. It's an odd, intimate class, and I'd like to repeat it. One of the sculptors gave me a bust he created, and it's sort of a composite of him and me.''</p>
