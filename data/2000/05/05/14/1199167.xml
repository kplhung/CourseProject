        <p>Peter Quinn letter disputes Charles Loring Brace 4th's April 9 letter on his ancestor Charles Loring Brace's book Races of the Old World</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Charles Loring Brace IV seems woefully unaware of the opinions his ancestor held on the Irish (Letters, April 9). Charles Loring Brace's ''Races of the Old World'' (1863) is filled with the Anglo-Saxon triumphalism of the period. It also echoes the racist claptrap contained in Samuel George Morton's ''Crania Americana'' (1839), which tied skull size to intelligence. Thus Brace could offer up this supposed anthropological fact: ''The difference between the average English and Irish skull is nine cubic inches, and only four between the average African and the Irish.'' Brace's book is still on the shelves of the New York Public Library. Let the reader judge for himself whether it is ''a purely descriptive work with no value judgments.''</p>
