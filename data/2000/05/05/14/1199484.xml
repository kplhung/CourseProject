        <p>CANADA has been called a nation that hews wood and draws water, even though it is home to some of the world's most successful high-technology companies. And after years in the financial wilderness, its economy and its stock market are on the prowl again.</p>
        <p>With little fanfare, the Toronto Stock Exchange 300 composite stock index has done much better so far this year than major market indexes elsewhere.</p>
        <p>The TSE 300 was up 9.5 percent through Friday, compared with a decline of 3.3 percent in the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index. Last year, the TSE 300 outperformed the S.&amp; P. 500, rising 31.7 percent in Canadian dollar terms.</p>
        <p>Still, the numbers may be deceiving. Nortel Networks, the big telecommunications company, represents nearly 26 percent of the TSE 300's market value. Last year, the stock rose more than 400 percent. Through Friday, it was up more than 6 percent.</p>
        <p>''When your top stock is viewed that favorably, that is very positive,'' said David Picton, a portfolio manager with Synergy Asset Management in Toronto.</p>
        <p>There are other positives besides Nortel.</p>
        <p>Price increases for oil and natural gas, as well as for other raw materials, are lifting Canadian natural-resource companies. And the prospect of further consolidation in the financial services industry has put a floor under bank stocks, despite rising interest rates in the United States.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most important, the Canadian economy is starting to hum.</p>
        <p>In a commentary on Wednesday, David Rosenberg, chief economist and strategist for Merrill Lynch Canada, wrote that ''today's economy is arguably the strongest it's been since the mid-1960's.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenberg said that if consensus forecasts proved correct, the Canadian economy should grow by more than 4 percent this year, adjusted for inflation, and an additional 3.5 percent in 2001.</p>
        <p>Benign inflation is another plus. Prices are rising at an annual rate of around 1.5 percent, well below most of the important inflation measures in the United States. And exports are surging.</p>
        <p>All of this suggests that the Canadian dollar, which has been in the doldrums, should be rising in value against other currencies, particularly the American dollar. That has not happened yet -- a major positive for American investors, analysts said.</p>
        <p>''The currency is cheap and stable,'' said Robert J. Haber, chief investment officer for Fidelity Canada Ltd., a unit of Fidelity Investments.</p>
        <p>Is it too late for investors to buy in? Leila Heckman, managing director of global asset allocation for Salomon Smith Barney, said that eight or nine months ago, Canada ''was one of our dream markets.''</p>
        <p>''The market has moved up a bit,'' Ms. Heckman said, ''but it is still our second choice among developed-country markets behind France.''</p>
        <p>While many Canadian companies, like Nortel and Celestica, which makes products for Lucent Technologies and Nokia, are listed on both Canadian and American exchanges, most are not. Of the 300 stocks that make up the Toronto index, Ms. Heckman said, only 10 percent are traded in New York.</p>
        <p>Mort Cohen, an expatriate Canadian who is chairman of Clarion Partners in Cleveland, which manages about $150 million in hedge and venture funds, said that about 25 percent of his firm's portfolio was invested in Canadian energy stocks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen said he owned Anderson Exploration, Canadian Occidental and Talisman Energy, and two drillers -- Precision Drilling and the Ensign Resource Service Group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Picton at Synergy Asset Management also owns Anderson Exploration, as well as Alberta Energy and Canadian Natural Resources. Despite Nortel's lofty valuation, he said he likes it for long-term investors. And he said that while he was not very excited about Canadian financial stocks, particularly the banks, he was a big fan of Toronto Dominion Bank.</p>
        <p>''Our banks are ripe for consolidation,'' he said. ''That will carry them for the next 6 to 12 months. But beyond that, they are shrinking relative to international competition.''</p>
        <p>Toronto Dominion is another story. ''Toronto Dominion has a big holding in TD Waterhouse,'' he said, referring to the the New York-based online brokerage firm, one of the top five. ''I think TD Waterhouse has the capability of becoming an Internet bank.''</p>
        <p>THE downside risk to further increases in Canadian stock prices is the 800-pound gorilla next door.</p>
        <p>''If the Federal Reserve tightens monetary policy too much and the U.S. economy rolls over, Canada will feel that recession,''  said Dan Chornous, chief strategist at RBC Dominion Securities in Toronto.</p>
        <p>''But if there is a soft landing in the U.S.,''  ''corporate earnings in Canada will prove to be sustainable,'' he continued. ''At that juncture, the Canadian market will be really well-placed.''</p>
