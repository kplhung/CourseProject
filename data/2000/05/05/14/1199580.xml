        <p>Dave Dobbyn is New Zealand's answer to Bruce Springsteen, a populist singer and songwriter whose homeland and countrymen are the source of his creative wellspring. Last March, when the Team New Zealand America's Cup squad paraded into an Auckland amphitheater to accept its awards for defeating Italy's Prada Challenge and defending the cup, a Dobbyn tune called ''Loyal'' provided the soundtrack for an open-air video montage of the crew's nautical heroics.</p>
        <p>''Out in the battle, where does allegiance lie?'' Dobbyn sang. ''We are loyal. Keep it that way now.''</p>
        <p>For many Kiwis, Dobbyn's lyrics have since taken on a special poignancy. For in the last two weeks, published reports in the United States, New Zealand, Europe and on the Internet have said that more than 20 Team New Zealand crew members have been offered lucrative contracts to defect and sail in the next cup, in 2003, aboard boats entered by overseas syndicates.</p>
        <p>One persistent story line is that the American businessmen Bill Gates, Jim Clark and Bill Koch -- either individually or in some combination -- have formed a Seattle-based syndicate targeting Kiwi sailors to make up the team's core crew. The reported offers, collectively in the tens of millions of dollars, would test the loyalty of the staunchest patriot, never mind a sailor with a mortgage.</p>
        <p>Gates, Clark and Koch have all denied interest in mounting a cup challenge. Nevertheless, there is evidence that behind-the-scenes machinations are in full swing in Europe, and other reports, wholly unsubstantiated, have named another Seattle-based entrepreneur as a cup player.</p>
        <p>A source close to Team New Zealand's inner circle says that the Kiwi skipper Russell Coutts has received substantial offers from multiple European-based syndicates. And Brad Butterworth, who has joined Coutts in the New Zealand team's administrative ranks, has fielded a seven-figure offer to plot onboard strategy for Prada.</p>
        <p>Neither of these stories is particularly surprising. Along with the legendary turn-of-the-century captain Charlie Barr, Coutts is the win ningest cup skipper in history. And in the war of wits in the 5-0 Kiwi sweep of Prada, Butterworth clearly outmatched the Italian tactician Torben Grael, much to the disgust of the syndicate chief, Patrizio Bertelli.</p>
        <p>But it was surprising to hear persistent rumors that the New Zealand grinders Craig Monk and Andrew Taylor, and the mastman, Matthew Mason, were also in line for major paydays. Though all are unquestionably superb sailors, they do not fill glamour positions. In the National Football League and in the America's Cup, the men in the trenches do not earn quarterback paychecks.</p>
        <p>Such speculation has fueled the notion that a backer with an unlimited cash supply is behind a major challenge, and the spotlight was turned on the Seattle billionaire Craig McCaw, who earned his fortune in the cellular-phone business.</p>
        <p>McCaw, a yachtsman who contributed $500,000 to Team New Zealand's 2000 defense fund and who docked his boat at Koch's cup compound in San Diego in 1995, seemed a likely candidate. But a McCaw operative insisted last week that McCaw did not intend to field his own cup team.</p>
        <p>''It's been discussed but it's gone no further,'' said Gary Wright, a McCaw associate in charge of international projects, who is based in the United Kingdom. ''We haven't put together anyone in a syndicate or made a challenge. There's absolutely no basis for lots of things being said in the press.''</p>
        <p>Wright also stated that McCaw had no involvement with the New Zealand lawyer Sean Reeves, a former Team New Zealand member who is allegedly recruiting Kiwi talent for an overseas syndicate.</p>
        <p>Should McCaw change his mind, he still has time. In a phone interview from Monaco, Pierpaolo Gardella, the general secretary for the next challenger's association, said that potential challengers had until March 2002, to announce their intentions. Gardella also confirmed that, thus far, the only official challenge to the Royal New Zealand Yacht Squadron has come from Prada.</p>
        <p>And there is no question that the Italians will continue to pursue talent from the international ranks. In addition to purchasing both boats sailed by the New York Yacht Club's Young America campaign in the last cup, Prada has scored a major coup by enlisting the services of the Hall Spars and the ex-Young America marine engineer Scott Ferguson to oversee mast and spar development. Prada, which built six complete rigs for the recent cup, will keep Ferguson busy.</p>
        <p>The cup scene in Europe surpasses anything officially under way in the United States, although the news is chock full of innuendo and tales of potential intrigue.</p>
