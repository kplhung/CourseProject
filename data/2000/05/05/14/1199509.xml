        <p>Warren E. Buffett cannot resist promoting the products of companies whose shares Berkshire Hathaway owns. And Buffettologists cannot resist trying to divine his next investment move.</p>
        <p>In the midst of Berkshire's annual meeting earlier this month, as Mr. Buffett and Charles T. Munger, the vice chairman, responded to questions, a tall blonde woman in a white uniform dress stepped onstage at the Omaha Civic Auditorium. She planted kisses on their cheeks. This, it turned out, was Mr. Buffett's way of announcing the introduction by Mattel Inc. of a new Barbie doll outfitted as a saleswoman for Berkshire's West Coast confectionery company, See's Candies.</p>
        <p>To some investors, the arrangement with Mattel suggested where Mr. Buffett might invest next -- or that he might already be buying Mattel stock, something he would not have to disclose until his stake became substantial.</p>
        <p>But others expressed doubt. Robert G. Hagstrom Jr., a portfolio manager for Legg Mason Focus Trust and author of ''The Warren Buffett Way: Investment Strategies of the World's Greatest Investor,'' (John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1994) said the toy business did not have the kind of predictable, long-term earnings that Mr. Buffett considers essential.</p>
