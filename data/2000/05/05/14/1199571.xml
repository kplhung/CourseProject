        <p>A team of unusually sedate Knicks went through free-throw drills while a pensive Jeff Van Gundy stood in the far corner of a gymnasium that seemed more like a recovery room.</p>
        <p>Today they tried to heal. After the Knicks relived the arching floater that spun off Anthony Carter's fingertips, bounded high off the rim and fell softly into the net Friday night, and after they confirmed at least in their minds that the play was excruciatingly illegal, the players dragged their tattered psyches onto the floor for practice.</p>
        <p>Visibly drained, they had only this one day to feel horrible about the clumsy way Game 3 ended, vent their opinion about the no-call that allowed a shot that might have been launched from behind the backboard by Carter, and then move on.</p>
        <p>In less than 24 hours, the Knicks had to be mentally prepared for Game 4 on Sunday at Madison Square Garden. There is a tomorrow. And that's the difference between the overtime bounce the Miami Heat got to take a two-games-to-one lead in this series on Friday night and the star-aligned runner that Allan Houston made to eliminate Miami in last season's playoffs.</p>
        <p>''One of the things I told the team was, that ended Miami's dream last year,'' Van Gundy said. ''This doesn't have to kill our dream. Our dream doesn't have to die because of his shot, unless we allow it to.''</p>
        <p>So the Knicks tried to focus on how to prevent another ending like the one in Game 3, which the Knicks lost, 77-76, in overtime. Van Gundy stressed rebounding, crisper execution and staying within themselves. On Friday night the Knicks missed block-out assignments, gave up 16 offensive rebounds, turned the ball over 19 times and turned their transition game into failed attempts at highlights. On one play, Houston flubbed a fast break by whipping the ball behind his back.</p>
        <p>''All I know is, when you're out there, you have to treat each possession with care,'' Houston said. ''We're playing a little loose right now, on defense and in transition. We have to treat every possession desperately. If we can do that, we can keep from having to squeeze out 1- or 2-point victories all the time.''</p>
        <p>The kind of cavalier play the Knicks have displayed at times could be a sign of a team too arrogant in its approach to the Heat. But Van Gundy bristled at that idea. He attributes the Knicks' fumbling in the critical minutes of Games 1 and 3 to the Heat's defensive pressure and to his team's mercurial attention span.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes, you have fluctuating habits,'' Van Gundy said. ''And we fluctuate. Sometimes, we're very careful with the ball, and we're efficient in transition. Other times, we are trying to play out of character, trying to be something we're not. It's no-look, behind-the-back passes, and that'll get you beat in this league. If you have 1-point games, one turnover, a missed free throw, a block-out -- and I know it's a game of mistakes, but we've made more than they have.''</p>
        <p>Patrick Ewing had his share. One moment, he was basking in the ovation for sending the game into overtime, the next he was losing his dribble, allowing Alonzo Mourning to grab offensive rebounds and missing a free-throw attempt to give Carter his chance to win the game.</p>
        <p>Today Ewing worked quietly on his game and left without talking. Most of the players were in similar moods. The normal joking and laughing, and the regular one-on-one games for individual Knick bragging rights, were not a part of today's somber scene.</p>
        <p>''At this point, there's disappointment,'' Latrell Sprewell said. ''You work so hard, and you play a tough team like Miami. You get so close, and you really have the game in your hands, when it slips away. It's very disappointing. And it's tiring. You know, mentally, it drains you. So guys are a little down today, a little low on energy.</p>
        <p>''I don't think at this moment the shot is behind us. But I think by the time we hit the floor on Sunday it will be.''</p>
        <p>It was an unsettling bounce for the Knicks to absorb. But there is another game. The Knicks have a chance to pull even with the Heat in this four-of-seven-game second-round series and put the pressure back on Miami.</p>
        <p>In one game, the Knicks can erase Carter's shot from their memories.</p>
        <p>''I think we were a little down today,'' Van Gundy said. ''Hopefully, by the time the game arrives, their being down and discouraged by losing will be turned into a determined effort.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>Although LARRY JOHNSON was on the floor in the final seconds to hit game-turning 3-pointers in Games 1 and 3 in the first round, Coach JEFF VAN GUNDY chose to go with the shot-blocking MARCUS CAMBY down the stretch of the fourth quarter and into overtime of the Knicks' Game 3 loss to Miami on Friday night. After the Knicks lost Game 1 in Miami, Van Gundy was criticized for keeping Camby on the bench late in the game. ''I just did what I thought was best,'' Van Gundy said. ''Obviously, it wasn't right because we didn't win. I'll be asked about, in every game that we lose, why I didn't play who I didn't play. So that's my answer. I made the decision I thought was best for my team and it didn't work out. So that's on me.'' . . . After ANTHONY CARTER's shot, LATRELL SPREWELL turned to the referee BOB DELANEY and argued for the basket to be discounted because it came from behind the backboard. ''He said to me, 'You're probably right, but I didn't see it,' '' Sprewell recounted. After viewing the replay, Van Gundy also still believed the shot was illegally launched from behind the backboard. The referee DAN CRAWFORD said the replay did not confirm the Knicks' argument.</p>
