        <p>The harder Davis Love III tries to win, the more difficult it seems to become.</p>
        <p>Shooting his worst round of the GTE Byron Nelson Classic, and seeing a four-stroke lead disappear, Love was tied with John Huston heading into Sunday's final round. Huston shot a three-under par 67 and moved to 10 under par for the tournament (200), even with Love, who struggled to a 71.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Love's one-over-par round left the door ajar for a host of pursuers.</p>
        <p>Jesper Parnevik, who shot 68, moved to seven under par, just three strokes off the lead. Phil Mickelson, who shot 68, was in fourth at six under par, while three players were tied for fifth at five under par -- Mark Brooks, Bob Estes and Paul Stankowski.</p>
        <p>All of them will begin Sunday in the hunt, while Love, who has not won since April 1998, found himself in danger of squandering another opportunity.</p>
        <p>Since his last victory at the MCI Classic, Love has 25 top-10 finishes and six second-place finishes, but no victories. That is enough to make any player lose confidence, but Love said he was looking forward to Sunday's round.</p>
        <p>''I didn't want to shoot one over par, but this wasn't the kind of day where I have to go back and wonder what's going on,'' said Love, who started the day at 11 under par, four strokes ahead of Huston. ''I drove the ball really well, and I made some putts. I just didn't hit the ball close that often, and I misjudged a few shots because of the wind. It was unbelievable how far the ball went on some shots, and that made it difficult just to step up and hit.''</p>
        <p>It was another difficult scoring day on the T.P.C. at the Four Seasons, as the wind blew in the opposite direction from Thursday and Friday and forced players to adjust. The front nine was particularly tough, and club selection was an inexact science.</p>
        <p>How much did things change? On Friday, Parnevik reached the green of the 390-yard No. 4 using a driver and a sand wedge. Today at the same hole, Parnevik used a driver and a 5-wood.</p>
        <p>But Huston, a five-time PGA Tour winner, made just one bogey and remained calm in the blustery conditions. He birdied the par-5 No. 7, made a 10-foot putt for birdie at No. 10, then hit a great sand wedge to 5 feet at No. 11 to set up another birdie. That moved Huston to nine under par, one stroke behind Love. And when Love bogeyed the 14th hole, while Huston made a 15-foot putt for birdie, Huston took a one-stroke lead for the first time in the tournament.</p>
        <p>However, Love responded with a birdie at the par-5 16th hole, hitting a splendid bunker shot to 2 feet on his third shot.</p>
        <p>Both players made par over the final three holes, and they will be paired again Sunday.</p>
        <p>''If I play well, I feel I have as good a chance to win as anyone,'' said Huston, whose last victory came in October 1998 at the National Car Rental Golf Classic at Walt Disney World in Florida. ''When you haven't won in a while, it gets a little harder. But you still have to play your game. With five or six holes to go, you can't get caught up in the moment.''</p>
        <p>But in many ways, Sunday will be a key moment for Love, with players like Parnevik, Huston and Mickelson in pursuit, on a course where the wind can be a major problem.</p>
        <p>Love has been waiting for a final round that ends with people congratulating him, rather than consoling him. And he hoped that his wait was almost over.</p>
        <p>''Phil and Jesper got right back where they wanted to be, and John did what he wanted to do -- catch up,'' Love said. ''It think it will be a good race tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>DAVIS LOVE III wrote No. 45 on the back of his golf cap in tribute to Adam Petty, the stock car racer who was killed in a crash Friday. ''I had gotten to know both RICHARD PETTY and KYLE PETTY,'' Love said. ''Richard Petty is truly the king, one of the nicest people in sports. I decided to wear the number. I watched the start of the race today and you could just see they lost a member of their family. It brought back a lot of memories of PAYNE STEWART,'' who died in a plane crash last October. . . . TIGER WOODS made a move, shooting 67 to reach three under par, seven strokes off the lead. Woods will be paired Sunday with DAVID DUVAL (three under par), the first time they have been paired together as a twosome in the final round.</p>
