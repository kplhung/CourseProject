        <p>THE newly won star status of the European entrepreneur, and the crushing burden of Big Government. The lure of the nimble American economic model, and the strengths of European multiculturalism. The unifying force of the euro, and lingering obstacles to a truly single European market.</p>
        <p>Those were some of the puzzle pieces on the table one evening early this month when the chief executives of six fast-growing companies gathered at the Hotel de Crillon here to talk with Money &amp; Business about the challenges facing European business.</p>
        <p>Rather than the larger-than-life characters who run Europe's imperial blue chips, these executives represent a relatively new type on the Continent's business scene: the upstart. And while none are household names in the United States, all have been especially successful at something for which European business is not particularly noted: creating jobs. They are members of a Brussels-based organization called GrowthPlus that promotes pro-business policies across national borders.</p>
        <p>The panelists were Leendert Bikker of the Bikker Communication Group, a Dutch public relations firm; Sylvain Forestier of D Interactive, a French marketing consultant; Christian Hunt of the EMDS Group, a  Belgian executive headhunting firm; Martin A. Schoeller of IFCO Systems, a German shipping specialist; Nico Willaert of Lernout &amp; Hauspie, a Belgian speech technology company; and Simon Worth of QAS Systems, a British software concern.</p>
        <p>The executives were joined in the two-hour discussion by Edmund L. Andrews, Alan Cowell, Jim Schachter, Andrew Ross Sorkin and John Tagliabue of The Times.</p>
        <p>Much of the conversation focused on a Europe in transition -- a place where a young, Internet-nurtured generation is artfully sidestepping political boundaries and cultural barriers to doing business, and where a multitude of tongues and national points of view both foster flexibility and impede change.</p>
        <p>The conversation was conducted in English, a second language for five of the chief executives. Following are excerpts, edited for space and clarity.</p>
        <p>Q.  We Americans often see Europe as being a place not exactly friendly to business, with a rigid labor market and difficulties in financing companies. Our newspapers are constantly reporting about how difficult it is to do business in a European context. And yet at the same time, we've been constantly reporting about how Europe is changing, how one market after another is being deregulated, whether it's telecommunications, airlines, banking, postal services. My question: Is Europe gradually coming around to your kind of company?</p>
        <p>MARTIN SCHOELLER -- I think the view of the entrepreneur in Europe, especially the last one or two years, has changed tremendously. Entrepreneurs are role models, are stars, are heroes. You don't have to defend yourself anymore, excuse yourself for being an entrepreneur.</p>
        <p>We think, too, that the European environment is better than it ever was, with low interest, low inflation, growth picking up -- and while the growth is picking up, the inflation isn't picking up. So I think we have a very, very positive outlook here, and we can grow stronger.</p>
        <p>Q.  What about the entrepreneurial environment in France?</p>
        <p>SYLVAIN FORESTIER -- I agree that there has been a lot of change. In the entrepreneurial environment, it's much easier to get money. The key issue for France is to change the state. Right now, the French state is way behind the private sector. Education is very much backward. And one of the things which could really prevent us from keeping on growing is the lack of people, because we don't have enough people, especially in the high-tech sectors.</p>
        <p>Q.  What has inspired the new appreciation for entrepreneurship here in Europe?</p>
        <p>SCHOELLER -- I think the Internet and the new markets -- the Nasdaq new markets -- changed the whole perception. First, the Internet makes it apparently easier to realize innovations and to get business models running. Second, it has taught the capital market that things might cost some money. It's not only the big corporations who can now afford start-up losses; the market is trading the future.</p>
        <p>I want to add, too, the issue of recruiting people. Everybody says how scarce talent is and how we lack in education on technology, on technical jobs and so forth. But on the positive side, I see that the growing companies get the good people. Before, ABB and Siemens took all the good talent from the market, and then McKinsey and Boston Consulting took the good talent.</p>
        <p>And now we are in the pole position, and they want to come to us. They want to come to strongly growing companies where they can get stock options that are not already at Mount Everest peak prices, that are still at a small price that can grow to big mountains. There is really a big change, and this is in the last 12 to 24 months. G.E. people are happy to come to us; Boston Consulting people come to us.</p>
        <p>Q.  Is that your experience, too, Christian, given the kind of business you're in?</p>
        <p>CHRISTIAN HUNT -- Yes, in the last two years, we've seen clearly a shift, in career preferences, from big traditional corporations, consulting firms, investment banks, etc. People are not honestly looking at the P/E's on the Nasdaq and the high-growth companies. And they are very, very much attracted. You see not one or two people leaving Boston Consulting and McKinsey and the others; you see tens and tens of them leaving.</p>
        <p>And obviously, there's a cultural shift. It's a big trend, If you look at Europe, the attraction for big, stable companies was very, very, very strong in the last 10, 20, 30 years, maybe. And now --</p>
        <p>SCHOELLER -- That's old economy.</p>
        <p>HUNT -- Yeah, that's old economy. And more and more, probably, people have realized that they have to take charge of their own future in a way. And the result is more attraction for high-growth companies, for stock option models and more people starting their own business.</p>
        <p>On the shortage of talent: There is clearly a shortage in Europe -- not just in Europe, but in particular in Europe -- in I.T. [information technology] and in global management capacity. As economies go global, all companies need people who can run global companies. And there are just not enough people. There's not enough people at the senior level; there's not enough people at all.</p>
        <p>SIMON WORTH -- I see that a little bit differently in the U.K. The first thing is that the social acceptability of starting a business in the U.K. started before the Internet.</p>
        <p>Probably 10, 15 years ago, suddenly, two things happened together. The American experience became more available through the media: satellite telly, quicker transmission of photos and numbers; you get American business pages and numbers in the London press. And in the case of the U.K., taxes and school fees came down. It sounds ridiculous, but if you're a middle-aged guy stuck in a serious job with one of these big companies, and you were paying 60 or 70 percent income tax, and you have two or three kids in private school, then you were stuck.</p>
        <p>The other thing that went on in my generation -- I'm coming up 40 -- was that suddenly, in the final year of university, employers were not there saying they'd employ you for life. They were saying 5 or 10 years. And I think this is a two-way street,  and both employees and employers have realized that you have to manage your own career. And all of a sudden the options for starting up in business on your own become easier and socially acceptable.</p>
        <p>I was employed by a corporation, and we were given instructions: You do not talk to people who've had a go on their own, because they were deemed as trouble. And that's done a U-turn. People of my generation think nothing of having had one or two gos and still be roaring along.</p>
        <p>LEENDERT BIKKER -- In Holland, becoming an entrepreneur is not an option when you leave high school or university. And that's because, in comparison to the small size of our economy, we have a lot of big internationals, like Unilever, like Royal Dutch, like Akzo Nobel, like Philips. That was Option One, to go to those big global companies.</p>
        <p>It was only 12 years ago when I left university, and all the students had to go to one of the teachers to discuss their future. ''Becoming an entrepreneur is a dead-end option,'' they told you. ''Don't do it.''</p>
        <p>Q.  So your teachers basically steered you to one of the big globals.</p>
        <p>BIKKER -- Yeah, yeah. And the new generation -- I have a son who became 16 last month, and he said, ''Dad, everything is fine, but my first option is having my own company.''</p>
        <p>And I said, ''What kind of company? And why?''</p>
        <p>''Doesn't matter what.''</p>
        <p>It's not taught at school, but the whole group of kids that age -- that's it. And they all talk about dot-coms.</p>
        <p>SCHOELLER -- What kind of father does he have?</p>
        <p>BIKKER -- No, no, it's not only his father. It's the new generation, because they're connected to all over the world. He spends his holidays all over the world. It's all over the Web.</p>
        <p>SCHOELLER -- And you can get rich quick now. This is totally exaggerated, but it shows to many people who were very risk-averse and looking for safety that, wow, this could be just incredible and outmaneuver everything you would do in a whole lifetime's work.</p>
        <p>Entrepreneurial Origins</p>
        <p>Q.  Were any of your fathers businessmen, or were they all working in large organizations?</p>
        <p>BIKKER -- [hiding his face in his hands] Civil servant.</p>
        <p>NICO WILLAERT -- Small entrepreneur.</p>
        <p>Q.  So entrepreneurialism is not all brand new.</p>
        <p>WILLAERT -- No, it's not all brand new. I'm happy to hear all these positive comments of my colleagues here. But just to put a couple of things in perspective -- and maybe I'm in the best place to do that, since we were the very first Belgian company quoted on Nasdaq, on Dec. 1, 1995: I had gone through the experience of going to the limits of what European bankers and Belgian bankers were prepared to give us. And even shortly before we went to Nasdaq, one of the bankers asked me if I could send him a sample of an algorithm.</p>
        <p>Now, in those days --</p>
        <p>SCHOELLER -- Even today --</p>
        <p>WILLAERT -- Yeah, even today, I think, you have to explain to a lot of people what an algorithm is. And software in general was something that made a lot of eyebrows start moving when you talked to bankers, because you didn't have buildings. Yes, you had computers, but what were they worth, after all? I mean, what were your assets?</p>
        <p>SCHOELLER -- Your assets go home in the night and eat and have sex.</p>
        <p>WILLAERT -- So it is, first of all, very recent. Secondly, what happened afterward in the European context -- the euro and so on -- helped the feeling that technology was going to play a very important role in our society. I think some of the examples that were set on Nasdaq, and the growth of Nasdaq in general, helped.</p>
        <p>Then, of course, we were not in such a bad position, particularly not our company. When you talk about languages, well, where do engineers talk three or four languages? Surely not in the States. I think Holland and Belgium and so on were very well placed -- and Scandinavia -- to engage in global international business.</p>
        <p>So we had a couple of assets when the Internet started showing that you could do other types of business than the classical ones.</p>
        <p>And I still wonder: Europe may be in a good position to help young entrepreneurs in their first phase, because there is this general feeling that these things are good. But I think there may be limits of $20 million, $30 million. Then, from there on, I think it still becomes relatively difficult to get proper financing.</p>
        <p>BIKKER -- The market in the U.S. is much more mature.</p>
        <p>WILLAERT -- It's much more mature. The capital market in the U.S.A., let's not forget, has always had this concept of conceptual I.P.O.'s. When you talk in Europe about the conceptual I.P.O., I think you still have a lot of explaining to do.</p>
        <p>Q.  Have any of you had to get financing from the States?</p>
        <p>SCHOELLER -- We are also on Nasdaq, yes, and we have funding from U.S. banks. That means 100-page contracts and covenants, higher cost of money, but faster and more supportive decisions.</p>
        <p>BIKKER -- Yes, but our banks are not run by entrepreneurs, but by policy makers.</p>
        <p>Weathering the Storms</p>
        <p>Q.  Do any of you have any fears or worries about what happens if and when the first real bear market arrives?</p>
        <p>FORESTIER -- I'm not very much worried about the possibility that we'd be slowed down by lack of funding, because there is a lot of money coming over; I'm talking about the venture capitalists. And as for the stock market, if you want to raise money, even with French stock you can raise a tremendous amount of money, more than $200 million. And if you really need more money, you can still choose an American bank as a second funding source, or you have other solutions.</p>
        <p>My first concern is that really there could be a slowdown in growth because of the lack of skilled people. And that's why in France we're fighting so much for stock options -- because we are in a fiscal environment which is not easy at all and which, of course, prevents us from keeping French talent from emigrating to the U.K. or the States. And, of course, it's not very easy to make U.S. engineers migrate to France, even with our wine and food.</p>
        <p>Q.  We talked about the change in the acceptance of entrepreneurs in Germany and Britain. What's the situation like in France?</p>
        <p>FORESTIER -- Well, I think it has improved a little bit, but I would definitely not say that there are stars. People are wary of us. French people don't like people to get rich. So they would like Microsoft, but not with the wealth of Bill Gates -- and without Bill Gates, if possible.</p>
        <p>SCHOELLER -- Don't you think the jealousy factor has come down a little bit? That was very dominating in the 70's and 80's. I somehow feel it changing, at least in Germany.</p>
        <p>FORESTIER -- What I would say is that young people, especially in the university, in school, have changed a little bit. But if you are talking to anyone on the street -- especially when you are talking to civil servants, one-third of the work force in France -- they don't like at all this sort of wealth going around in the economy.</p>
        <p>WILLAERT -- What worries me most in the whole concept of the new economy is how very important perception is for the value of a company. If things go down on Nasdaq, Easdaq follows, and you have quite a domino effect throughout the world. These are things that do not emanate from an individual company and that you do not have control of.</p>
        <p>But the fact is when people like Motorola, Intel or Microsoft issue profit warnings, that is enough for a lot of investors to run out of the technology sector.</p>
        <p>You can say all right, whether our company has a market cap of $7 billion or only $5 billion, you won't eat one steak less or more as an entrepreneur. But, mind you, at a certain moment when you're using your shares as a currency to acquire other companies, these things become important. So if you're not careful, you're overtaken by elements that are totally out of your control.</p>
        <p>WORTH -- It works the other way. You could be acquired equally if your share value is low. That makes you more receptive to an acquisition.</p>
        <p>WILLAERT -- Absolutely, absolutely.</p>
        <p>Navigating a New Era</p>
        <p>Q.  Is this a new era, then, an environment that European executives have to deal with and are ready to deal with?</p>
        <p>WILLAERT -- I think we're enjoying it right now, because it is a new challenge, it's a new game, and we're not playing too badly. What I just wonder is whether we're all aware of the consequences, ultimately, of that type of game.</p>
        <p>Q.  Is Europe having a harder time throwing away fundamentals?</p>
        <p>FORESTIER -- There was a joke going around France recently during the drop in the market. The Nasdaq closed down and, of course, the following morning, the French stock market was down. Then one day, the Nasdaq was high, and the following morning the French stock market was down. And so someone wrote: Well, who knew? We don't need the Americans to go down.</p>
        <p>Seriously, the problem in France is that we started much later than the U.S. economy on the model and the growth. And so if the U.S. economy is slowing down, it could really slow us down before we really arrive at something good.</p>
        <p>SCHOELLER -- There's no reason that the economy slows down.</p>
        <p>FORESTIER -- I hope not.</p>
        <p>SCHOELLER -- Because new technology enables growth without heating up inflation and enables more and more services to be exchanged. And there is no limit to exchanging services. It doesn't cost material, it doesn't cost energy, it doesn't waste anything. And our Internet world allows us to grow in services without limit, without a top.</p>
        <p>That's why I don't see growth going down at all. We only have an issue of how long shall the Europeans move slower, and how efficiently will the European government, with one currency, promote competition.</p>
        <p>A Sustainable Boom?</p>
        <p>Q.  People say the American economy has moved into a phase of sustained growth, whereas in Europe the danger is that it's simply another cyclical upswing. Do you agree?</p>
        <p>BIKKER -- No doubt about it that we follow the U.S. market, because there is not a U.S. market and a European market and an Asian market anymore. There is a global market. I guess Holland and Germany are the No. 2 and 3 investors in the U.S.</p>
        <p>Q.  What about labor mobility?</p>
        <p>BIKKER -- Labor mobility is much lower in Europe, because of the culture and the language. That's not an economic difference; that's a generational difference.</p>
        <p>Q.  Christian, do you find that this is the case?</p>
        <p>HUNT -- People are ready to move, for sure. And as we move more into a service economy, physical mobility becomes less of a requirement, actually. You need people to be able to work in global companies and speak languages -- speak English in particular. More and more people are able to do that. Now you can work on the network from Alaska, servicing a company based in India. I mean, all the software development companies use offices in India and all over the world to be able to work on a 24-hour basis.</p>
        <p>And I guess that's an area where Europe actually has an advantage, because we are more used to different languages.</p>
        <p>Q.  But there are obstacles, too.</p>
        <p>WORTH -- There are all sorts of impediments. We've got different tax regimes in different nations. We've got different legal structures. When we wanted to set up in Holland and Germany, we doubled our legal bill to write contractual agreements, to employ staff, to license customers. And then you go to another nation; you do it again.</p>
        <p>SCHOELLER -- The banks. Banks cannot control assets in other countries.</p>
        <p>WORTH -- So you have another bank account. In America, a state is part of the same nation. So you achieve economies of scale. And I think that's quite significant. We're not quite on this boom yet in Europe.</p>
        <p>SCHOELLER -- But still, we're on a track to --</p>
        <p>WORTH -- I agree. We are moving forward. But there are still very entrenched problems in Europe. Americans can sell to 250 million consumers. Don't kid yourself. We can't sell to 300 million consumers in Europe as readily as you can in the States. We incur much more cost and many more impediments, and I think many of those things will take longer to change.</p>
        <p>HUNT -- Yes, but if you look at it from a global point of view, we are in a much better position to sell to Europeans because we understand European culture.</p>
        <p>WORTH -- Certainly.</p>
        <p>HUNT -- The Americans probably have more difficulty in doing that. And certainly if we can leverage on that capacity, we can do that also on a global basis. So to the various cultural environments, the various tax environments, the new generation of entrepreneurs says: Nobody operates in an ideal environment. That's the environment we have to deal with, and we find solutions around that.</p>
        <p>Sometimes it means the underground economy. Sometimes it means other solutions. And altogether, we are developing skills that will be, I think, very, very useful for the global economy.</p>
        <p>The Impact of the Euro</p>
        <p>Q.  What difference has the euro made? And is it creating pressure for change?</p>
        <p>HUNT -- It is. The main impact, seen from my own perspective, is it's another element showing that European economics is becoming actually one element in the global economy, that it is becoming one single economy. And, sure, it means stability. It means it's a lot easier to do business between France and Germany and Belgium and the Netherlands, etc., and there's no risk factor in exchange risk.</p>
        <p>Q. Mr. Willaert, has it made a big difference for your company?</p>
        <p>WILLAERT -- Let me put it this way: The euro has been launched in a very euphoric way. And I think it gave us, as Europeans, a good feeling that we were now ready to face international competition.</p>
        <p>But I don't really see, at this moment, very much progress in really having a unified market. I still feel that countries individually take advantage, and that there is a tremendous difference in doing business in France than in Holland, Belgium, Germany and the U.K. Having said that, all the business community felt strongly in support of the euro because, in our inter-European transactions, it helps a great deal.</p>
        <p>A lot of the future of the European Community will have to do with the social aspects and the harmonizing of the social aspects -- because, let's face it, if you have things made in Portugal, they're bound to be a lot cheaper than in Holland. If you have things made in Greece, they're bound to be a lot cheaper.</p>
        <p>Whether it really has an impact on European business with the rest of the world? I'm not too sure. I get the feeling we're sheltering ourselves within a little bit of Fortress Europe.</p>
        <p>SCHOELLER -- The question is: Can we afford forever this free world trade theory, or shall we switch to what has already been discussed in Seattle -- a fair trade theory, where free trade can happen when a country applies certain minimum salaries and certain minimum ecological standards? That's the question.</p>
        <p>WILLAERT -- This is what affects political decision-making. We have politicians who will go against mobility, because they are afraid that the new economy will take jobs from local people. But that is not necessarily the case.</p>
        <p>Q.  So what is the solution?</p>
        <p>WILLAERT -- My feeling is that we do not have political statesmanship anymore. And that is the major problem that we have. We still have European nations where every politician is getting a profile for himself and is capable of falling back on his national political playing field. We are not harmonizing the situation within Europe.</p>
        <p>BIKKER -- The policy makers are focused on very rigid systems to solve all the problems with one system for everything.</p>
        <p>SCHOELLER -- And the market is assaulted by demands for flexibility.</p>
        <p>Q.  Is the overall trend heading in the direction of liberalization, the direction supportive of entrepreneurs, regardless of what political party is in power in the country?</p>
        <p>SCHOELLER -- I think that everybody would agree that politicians have less and less leverage, and instead of being there like the king and deciding what has to happen, they have to run after the resources to make their country efficient and look attractive, just like companies have to be attractive. It's like running a club. They have to say: ''I ask a membership fee, it's less than the other guy and we still have good services here.'' And this triggers a sense of competition that was never there before.</p>
        <p>And the other thing is that entrepreneurs don't feel the government too much, because we have the freedom of capital. The poor victim is the employee. And the employees should stand up and should ask governments to make a more entrepreneur-friendly country, to get more entrepreneurs in and make jobs.</p>
        <p>BIKKER -- Twenty years ago, we had a left-wing -- very left-wing -- minister of economic affairs in the Dutch market. And that was the reason one of the leading guys of Royal Dutch, a member of the board, left Shell after 20 years of serving Shell all over the world, to become a member of Parliament -- just to oppose these left-wing politics. Now, 20 years later, the one is the president of the European Central Bank, the other is a European Union commissioner for fiscal affairs, and they tell exactly the same story.</p>
        <p>HUNT -- Maybe the weakness or the strength of the dollar is an illustration of everything we're talking about here. If the euro goes further down, it's going to become alarming, and hopefully everybody's going to wake up and say, ''O.K., now we really have to do something about this.'' And it becomes easier to say that to the French unions, etc. And I guess it represents the pressure of the financial markets here, international financial markets, who are saying we've got to do something. Because the European economy is not doing that badly. And the euro should be stronger.</p>
        <p>Rewards for Risk-Takers</p>
        <p>Q.  I am struck by the incredible popularity, in companies going public these days, of stock options and other kinds of incentive programs -- and of the possibility of getting very rich very quickly. That implies, with it, a whole different attitude on the part of employees toward loyalty, staying with a company, notions of relative egalitarian pay and so forth. Do these things change business culture for you?</p>
        <p>BIKKER -- Of course, it has an impact on corporate culture and ways of working. It's new, and we want it old. In Western Europe, it used to be that your whole life was guaranteed and organized. So this feels like quite the opposite. And we will end up in the middle, I guess.</p>
        <p>SCHOELLER -- I think it's helpful -- because it puts tremendous additional pressure on performing and benchmarking and transparency and professionalism that wasn't there before, when we were a private company. And if we look at the stock markets that have grown by 15 percent while the economy grows by 3 percent, one can deduce from it that you can get in the left lane and start heading faster. It's caused much more work and much more stress, but it points in the right direction.</p>
        <p>BIKKER -- And much more fun.</p>
        <p>WORTH -- I don't know about you chaps, but I'm firmly in favor of share options. We're still privately owned, and we have 14 percent of the equity amongst 176 staff out of 230-odd. And it brings people to pay attention to what we do; it makes them be constructive, be critical of their colleagues. They don't waste raw materials or energy.</p>
        <p>But the other thing that I find quite amusing and interesting is that it obliges people to learn about the business of business, where before they didn't. You know, what is a joint stock company? What is this private or public limited liability? What's the difference between a shareholder and an officer and a member?</p>
        <p>BIKKER -- And this helps.</p>
        <p>WORTH -- I think it's very progressive for everyone.</p>
        <p>BIKKER -- This also helps in creating breakaways -- new start-ups.</p>
        <p>WORTH -- Well, one of the humorous bits is you then have trained executives who know how to do all those things. But that's part of the game, isn't it? What goes around comes around.</p>
        <p>BIKKER -- I guess one of the biggest compliments you can have as an entrepreneur is the number of breakaways.</p>
        <p>WORTH -- Exactly.</p>
        <p>BIKKER -- That's the way the Dutch play soccer.</p>
        <p>A Continent in Transition</p>
        <p>Q.  Would you like to make any concluding points that might be useful for American readers to know about European business?</p>
        <p>WILLAERT -- What is important to realize is that Europe is going through a transition period. I think that's the key word there. And transition means a balancing act. And we are not doing too badly on that balancing act. But I would hope for a bit more statesmanship on the European level to improve on the longer-term vision of what we are doing.</p>
        <p>And I think if we can take a lot of the good aspects from the U.S. economy -- take some of the good points there and mix it and blend it with where we are traditionally strong: a good basis of social security, a good concept of health care, good schooling. If we can blend that to a good mixture, I think Europe has a fantastic future.</p>
        <p>FORESTIER -- I think that Americans should realize that Europe is different from America, that the idea's not for Europe to do exactly the same as America, only a few years after. Europe will succeed by inventing a new way of doing business, especially business in the new economy. And I'm really confident about what we are going to invent, provided all the world surrounding us remains stable, because we are really dependent on government.</p>
        <p>What worries me more is the pace of it. I mean, within 10 years we definitely have invented something new and something profound, but how fast is it going to move? And is the surrounding world going to wait for us to make our move?</p>
        <p>BIKKER -- We are absolutely on the right track, and I'm very positive about our future. Let's focus on the very good things that many countries in Europe have organized pretty well. Probably Scandinavia and, I think, the Dutch are the best in education and health care. I've got a lot of kids and I don't pay any kind of hospital care or education costs --</p>
        <p>SCHOELLER -- But if you would pay, our system becomes more efficient.</p>
        <p>BIKKER -- That's one of my big problems with Europe: We have by far too many fines, and subsidies for all kinds of initiatives. If we can bring them back down to zero, in agriculture and also other industries, that will speed up prosperity.</p>
        <p>HUNT -- Just like everybody else, I'm quite optimistic on the future of Europe. First of all, because it's never the endgame, it's an ongoing game forever -- at least that's what we hope. And I think that the biggest challenge for everybody today is globalization, and I believe that Europe is quite well placed from that point of view.</p>
        <p>SCHOELLER -- I would say from the American perspective, if you look to Europe, the trends are very positive -- the political trends and liberalization, an easing environment for business. We have the trends of innovation. We have the trends that if capital markets catch up, the stock exchanges catch up, the Internet catches up. It's like an undervalued stock.</p>
        <p>And I think the fact that we have the multicultural challenge -- that one McDonald's burger cannot be sold all over the world the same way because of the cultural differences -- makes us more fit.</p>
        <p>And we have to be able to grow, so even if governments put many hurdles before us, we are still growing. Sometimes American investors think it's better to keep their money in America, but they have much more potential to unlock if they put it into Europe.</p>
        <p>Q. When's the secondary offering? Sign me up. Simon?</p>
        <p>WORTH -- We are changing. We are deregulating and becoming more liberal in the business environment, and I suspect for Americans, that balancing act is what they'll see.</p>
        <p>Q. Thank you all very much.</p>
