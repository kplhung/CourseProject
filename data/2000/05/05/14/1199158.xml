        <p>Gardens are a perennial topic in children's literature, and with good reason. For one thing, there's the element of growing, always a preoccupation with small readers. For another, gardening exudes a certain magic. Who can deny that it is wizardry when a speck of a seed, tucked into the soil, turns into a 12-foot-tall sunflower or a 300-pound pumpkin? Or even becomes a tiny tomato, say one with the endearing name of Lollipop? It is an act that inspires childlike awe in the most veteran gardener. And let's not forget color. A garden in full bloom practically begs to be transported to the pages of a picture book; its palette is more varied than any illustrator's paint box.</p>
        <p>Another aspect of gardening that is equally appealing, though somewhat less apparent, is the comfort that comes from its repetitious tasks and the sense of continuity of those rhythms. Sow, water, weed and reap. This is a millenniums-old cycle -- which means that it's older than mom. Or mom's mom or grandma's mom or ''Little House on the Prairie.'' Sow, water, weed and reap is the stuff of a great story.</p>
        <p>Three new books, each with a garden theme, include at least some of these connections. ''My First Garden'' embraces them all. This affecting and wonderfully illustrated memoir opens with the adult author, Tomek Bogacki, on a train, gazing out on the green countryside and being reminded of his youth in Poland. He reminisces, in words and paintings, about his town with its red-roofed houses like ''a big bed of flowers,'' about the cobblestone courtyard where he played, and about the bike, inherited from his brother, that finally allowed him to venture beyond the restrictive world of the courtyard.</p>
        <p>Bogacki is in no hurry to get to the garden of his title, preferring to linger over these earlier memories, sowing the seeds of a parallel tale. Lucky for us. In his impressionistic style, he fills page after page with details from his childhood, a scrapbook of images -- big ones, small ones, close-ups, fragments. Many are identified by the memory they hold. The bakery where he bought ice cream on his way home from school. His kitchen, which often smelled like freshly baked apple pie. And always, without caption, a constant: the red roofs of his town. His colors are compelling, evoking nature but more muted, as if seen through the screen door of time.</p>
        <p>Midway through the story, young Bogacki rides his bike out of town one day and discovers a field full of wildflowers. He is inspired with a desire to fill the courtyard with flowers, a desire that becomes resolve after his grandfather tells him about the garden that was in that space when he was a boy. Although it takes up only the second half of the book, the making of the courtyard garden and the happiness that blooms with it leave the lasting impression. This is another close-up, a captivating detail that depicts the whole.</p>
        <p>Those familiar with Bogacki's other work, especially the popular ''Cat and Mouse'' books, will find ''My First Garden'' far more sophisticated. The illustrations, both individually and taken together, are so evocative that ''My First Garden'' hardly needs text. In fact, the words may bog down some younger or more action-oriented readers who would prefer to cut to the chase. Like a garden itself, this story takes a while to grow. But in good time, the train brings the author back to the present and to his son, who has a first garden of his own. The patient reader will reap a rich harvest.</p>
        <p>Another new book whose wonderful illustrations recall bygone days is ''A Gardener's Alphabet.'' For starters, Mary Azarian, whose illustrations for ''Snowflake Bentley'' won the 1999 Caldecott Medal, works in hand-colored woodcuts, itself a time-honored art. This is not a memoir, though, but an A B C, and Azarian's full-page prints, each framed by a black line border, don't belong to any specific year but seem to spring from an amorphous era of rural American life. In Azarian's hands, this period comes robustly alive.</p>
        <p>Each print pulls back the curtain on a charming country scene, a stand-alone tableau telling the tale of a gardening-related word. Her people, sturdy folks with apple cheeks, radiate fresh air and serenity as they Dig and Weed and Prune and Harvest. Even the animals, family pets and wildlife, look well fed and content. Whisker-nosed moles are positively beguiling as they tunnel blindly beneath the fat tubers of a potato plant, Underground. It's almost possible to forgive these creatures for the countless rows of spuds lost to their real-life counterparts. The same goes for the benign-looking potato beetle and the pristine grub. They are all a testament to the joy of gardening.</p>
        <p>One or two of the illustrations are less successful, and some of the word choices are questionable. While Everything and Nibble and Rest can be made applicable to the garden, they don't have the same iron-clad claim on it as do Compost and Seeds. This is a small quibble, though, and compensated for by the color, clean and bright as a clump of State Fair zinnias, and by the pitch-perfect details on most pages. Mary Azarian knows gardening from her Wellingtons up, and her knowledge and love show in her artwork. Whether or not ''A Gardener's Alphabet'' works absolutely as an A to Z, it is a warm and lovely introduction to gardening.</p>
        <p>BY comparison with the olden-days atmosphere and leisurely pace of Azarian's and Bogacki's books, ''Round the Garden'' is direct and new. Part of this feeling comes from knowing that the author, Omri Glaser, now age 9, was a freshly minted 7-year-old when he wrote the text.</p>
        <p>He tells the circular story of a tear, tracing it from puddle through evaporation to rain upon the garden. The rain makes the onions grow; the onions produce more tears. Bold, highly colored illustrations by Byron Glaser (Omri's father) and Sandra Higashi are digitally created and don't seem as organic as the tale. More science than sorcery, ''Round the Garden'' offers a worthwhile lesson to young gardeners and inspiration to budding authors.</p>
