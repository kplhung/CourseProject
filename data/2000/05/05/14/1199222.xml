        <p>Sheriff David Harder from Binghamton, N.Y., was admiring the twill V-neck shirts at the Robinson Textiles booth while two saleswomen plugged the shirts' comfort and design and the ''industrial laundry grade fabric'' and the stylish short-sleeve cut that makes it nearly impossible to conceal weapons. A steal at $6.15 each. This was just one of 300 or so booths at Jail Expo in the Sacramento Convention Center two weeks ago.

        <p>These are good times for the makers of everything from bulletproof 10-inch-square ''groin guards'' to flame-retardant blankets. Last month, the Department of Justice reported that from 1990 to 1999 the incarceration rate increased from one in every 218 residents to one in every 147. By 2001, the number of prisoners in America is expected to reach the two-million mark.

        <p>Vendors have also benefited from recent high-profile incidents. Julie Stein of ATD-American Company said that after the Columbine High School shootings, her company saw increased sales of hand-held metal detectors to schools. Dan Corcoran, Aedec International's president, has accessorized his chair-based ''human restraint systems'' to accommodate smaller bodies. For Stearns Wear, which sells the transparent polyester Spit Sock Hood, the World Trade Organization conference protests in Seattle brought a massive order from the city's police department.</p>
        <p>But current events have given perhaps the biggest boost to Booth No. 1537, where Jenny Delroy of Jaycor Tactical Systems was reloading a semiautomatic rifle that shoots pepper balls -- nonlethal pellets that disperse pepper powder on impact. The very weapon, she explained, that was used on the protesters in Seattle. Under Delroy's supervision, correctional officers fired as many as 12 loud rounds per second at a manikin's shredded torso. ''We actually recommend a burst of five to eight rounds,'' Delroy said. ''If that works, fine. If not, shoot 'em again.''</p>
