        <p>THE process of a Long Island cover band moving on to become cover boys is more revolutionary than evolutionary. But that is just the transition the rock band Nine Days has made.</p>
        <p>The quintet has accomplished, in a few years, what hundreds of local bands have attempted, unsuccessfully, for decades -- securing a major-label recording contract. Nine Days was signed by 550 Music/Epic Records Group, and their CD, ''The Madding Crowd,'' will be released this Tuesday. Their debut single, ''Absolutely (A Story About a Girl),'' has already reached No. 71 on Billboard's Hot 100 and has broken into the Top 15 on the modern rock chart.</p>

        <p>THE process of a Long Island cover band moving on to become cover boys is more revolutionary than evolutionary. But that is just the transition the rock band Nine Days has made.</p>
        <p>The quintet has accomplished, in a few years, what hundreds of local bands have attempted, unsuccessfully, for decades -- securing a major-label recording contract. Nine Days was signed by 550 Music/Epic Records Group, and their CD, ''The Madding Crowd,'' will be released this Tuesday. Their debut single, ''Absolutely (A Story About a Girl),'' has already reached No. 71 on Billboard's Hot 100 and has broken into the Top 15 on the modern rock chart.</p>
        <p>The album is a collection of a dozen pop songs produced by Nick DiDia, who engineered hit albums by bands like Korn, Rage Against the Machine and Pearl Jam.</p>
        <p>While Long Island has had pop superstars like Billy Joel, Debbie Gibson, Taylor Dayne and Mariah Carey, it hasn't fared as well in the rock band category. Since the 1980's, less than a handful of local bands have gained national attention, and they were borderline novelty acts, like the heavy metal Twisted Sister and the rockabilly Stray Cats. A few years ago, the wonderfully eccentric Bogmen made some minor waves, and in 1998, the transplanted-to-Long Island Marcy Playground served up a No. 1 single (''Sex and Candy''), but soon fell out of sight.</p>
        <p>What makes Nine Days think it will make it? ''We've been working toward this for a long time,'' said Brian Desveaux, 28, of Selden, the vocalist, guitarist and co-songwriter, along with John Hampson. ''We've been working on our songs, our playing and our harmonies. We have a really strong album.''</p>
        <p>Coming up through the often unsympathetic local live music scene was not easy. Many Island bands find they have to play songs by Blink 182, Sugar Ray or the Beatles in order to survive. Local audiences, for the most part, are not interested in original music. For that they go to Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''Some of us struggled in the cover band scene,'' Mr. Desveaux said. ''John and I got tired of the whole metal and heavy guitar-riff band we were in and in 1993, we took a year off and sat in an apartment in Deer Park and wrote a lot of music with big harmonies. We were greatly influenced by Dylan, Bruce Springsteen and Neil Young. We got back to songs. We also got back to our own roots, which was 80's- and 90's-styled rock.''</p>
        <p>Songwriting became the key. ''If the song didn't work on acoustic guitar, then it wasn't a good song,'' Mr. Desveaux said.</p>
        <p>They eventually hooked up with Nick Dimichino, bassist, and a new project was in the works. The group recorded eight tracks with a studio drummer. Soon Vincent Tattanelli (who had been the drummer in the popular cover band Wonderama with Mr. Hampson and Mr. Desveaux) and Jeremy Dean, keyboard player, joined the band, and it released its first CD, ''Something to Listen To.'' The CD took nine days to record -- hence, the name Nine Days.</p>
        <p>Nine Days began a weekly gig at the Village Pub in Port Jefferson, performing every Monday, attracting audiences ranging from 50 to 125 people. The band members continued writing, and by 1996, they had released their second CD, ''Monday Songs,'' which began attracting attention for its original material. Nine Days won several radio battle-of-the-bands competitions, like WBAB's Homegrown Talent Search and WLIR's Best Unsigned Band contest.</p>
        <p>By 1997, the band used studio time it had won to record a third CD, ''Three.''</p>
        <p>''We were ready,'' Mr. Desveaux said. ''We were raring to get something done.'' They took their four best songs and contacted Pat Thrall, a producer who had worked with Meat Loaf, among others.</p>
        <p>The band's sound was similar to popular alternative groups like the Goo Goo Dolls, Third Eye Blind and Matchbox 20, but A&amp;R executives could not see beyond the lack of one prime ingredient. ''Everyone passed on us at least once,'' Mr. Desveaux said. ''They kept telling us, 'Your stuff is really good, but you're missing a hit.' ''</p>
        <p>The tough breeding ground of Long Island was beginning to take its toll. ''There aren't that many places to play original music,'' Mr. Desveaux said, ''and places that do have live music hire cover bands.'' So the band began to play Manhattan clubs (which are more friendly to original music), returning to perform on the Island once or twice a month.</p>
        <p>In August 1998, Mr. Hampson, who had begun writing with an edgier sound, tried to write the hit song everyone was looking for. In one day, he came up with ''Absolutely,'' a song written about his girlfriend. In February 1999, Nine Days signed a record deal.</p>
        <p>At this stage, it is not only about records. The band has appeared on the covers of The Inside Connection and The Island Ear.</p>
        <p>It recently filmed its first video for ''Absolutely,'' in Los Angeles. ''It was a really cool experience,'' Mr. Desveaux said. ''There were 50 people working on it. It was very exciting.'' The video is now being aired by both MTV and VH-1.</p>
        <p>The single has become one of the most added to radio play lists, but WLIR, based in Garden City, began playing the song two weeks earlier than any other station.</p>
        <p>But the band has not forgotten its roots. The celebration for the release of ''Madding Crowd'' will be held at Sam Goody's at Roosevelt Field at 5 p.m. Tuesday.</p>
        <p>So will they become a one-hit wonder, like other recent Long Island signings? ''No. I don't think so,'' Mr. Desveaux said. ''Our album's really good from the first song to the finish.</p>
        <p>''I just hope it does well enough so we can make a second album. We're not in this to be rock stars, we just want to have careers and last for a while.''</p>
        <p>These are the heady days for a new band on the brink. Interviews, filming videos, groupies, record company, watching charts, label executives doing your bidding, television appearances (the band just filmed an appearance on VH-1's ''The List,'' with John Travolta) -- it's easy to be overwhelmed.</p>
        <p>''It's funny,'' said Mr. Desveaux, who is in the midst of a national mini-tour with performances in different cities almost every night. ''It's definitely real, but it really hasn't hit me yet. I'm not a 16-year-old kid who would get all starstruck by it, but when the record actually gets in the store and people actually have it, then I'll get really excited.</p>
        <p>''I'm in the middle of it, so it's certainly more exciting for my friends and family than for me right now. I just want to be able to make music for a long time. But it is amazing, a group of guys from Long Island getting a chance like this.''</p>
