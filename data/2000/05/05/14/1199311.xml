        <p>THE Night Governess'' was a child of summer, having had two staged readings in July in the last two years.</p>
        <p>Even though Polly Pen's strange new musical is now bringing the winter-spring repertory on the McCarter mainstage to a close, it is no stretch to call it a show for all seasons.</p>
        <p>Alternately dark and light and dreamy, the play was inspired by the 1866 novella ''Behind a Mask,'' written by Louisa May Alcott under the nom de plume A. M. Barnard.</p>
        <p>''As a child, the only Alcott I knew was 'Little Women' and I didn't like it,'' Ms. Pen told Janice Paran, the McCarter dramaturg. But Alcott also wrote potboilers -- ''sensation stories, lurid things,'' Alcott said -- which paid better than the moral and the domestic.</p>
        <p>Resetting the story to Philadelphia, and retreating nine years to a pre-Civil War time, to include male characters, Ms. Pen was drawn to the work's subtitle, ''A Woman's Power.'' She told Ms. Paran that she hoped power struggles between men and women would not be resolved. ''It would be so bad for the theater,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Such quirky thinking, not to mention the notion of defining and playing with time, informs ''The Night Governess,'' which is a model of whimsy controlled. Ever inventive and searching, Ms. Pen composes and writes lyrics and libretto with a classically playful air:</p>
        <p>We are doing nothing with it</p>
        <p>Waiting here within it</p>
        <p>Waiting for someone who</p>
        <p>Will tell us what to do with time.</p>
        <p>''Time'' is the title of the first number, an extended ensemble true to opera buffa; ''More Time'' opens Act Two. Other song titles: ''Dreams of Dreams,'' ''Truth,'' ''Knowledge,'' ''Crying No. 1'' and ''Crying No. 2,'' each one lyrically descriptive.</p>
        <p>Those are the subjects of the wonder and yearning of heart and mind. Ms. Pen's dialogue is meticulous about ''The Beautiful Detail,'' another song. Here, tea is not just tea. It is served in praise of the specific niceties of Darjeeling.</p>
        <p>Even before the arrival of Jean Muir, the sort of strange governess the languid Coventry family deserves, ominousness and titillation fill the air.</p>
        <p>Nothing will be the same after she arrives, we are foretold. ''We will all be changed,'' the housekeeper (the witty Alma Cuervo) sings.</p>
        <p>They are and she should know. ''Expect a plot twist soon,'' she says later.</p>
        <p>In cahoots with the sly housekeeper, who smokes cigars on her day off, the governess (Judith Blazer) gives a grand performance of a woman possesed.</p>
        <p>That it is truly a performance is, perhaps, saying too much, and if her lessons (not just to Nellie, her 16-year-old charge) were not confined to the night, there would be no need for ''The Somnambulists's March.''</p>
        <p>The eldest son, played by the excellent Robert Sella would have no reason to talk of ''enchanted sleep'' and the funny Mary Stout as the matriarch wouldn't keep nodding off.</p>
        <p>Ms. Blazer's dark soprano enhances her mystery-woman character. In delightful duet, she and Nellie (Danielle Ferland) sing of life's essential skills, or how many ways one can construct and embroider a sentence.</p>
        <p>Ms. Blazer conquers everyone, including the family dog named Chaos (John Jellison) and Mr. Sella, with whom she performs beguiling melodic and stylistic shifts, ending with a romantic rush.</p>
        <p>''The Night Governess'' takes us to a place where the imagination flourishes.</p>
