        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In response to Terry Teachout's article about the lounge group Dave's True Story [''A Little Disturbing, A Little Unnerving: Postmodern Lounge,'' April 30], as president of Chesky Records I would like to offer a few comments about the recording ''Unauthorized.'' When Dave Cantor and Kelly Flint approached us about recording a follow-up album to ''Sex Without Bodies,'' we were extremely excited about the project. We made an effort to give the group more control and freedom by letting them choose their own producer, who they ultimately decided would be their bass player and current manager. At the sessions, the producer and the group approved all of the takes. When the album was completed, everyone involved felt we had created a wonderful recording.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In response to Terry Teachout's article about the lounge group Dave's True Story [''A Little Disturbing, A Little Unnerving: Postmodern Lounge,'' April 30], as president of Chesky Records I would like to offer a few comments about the recording ''Unauthorized.'' When Dave Cantor and Kelly Flint approached us about recording a follow-up album to ''Sex Without Bodies,'' we were extremely excited about the project. We made an effort to give the group more control and freedom by letting them choose their own producer, who they ultimately decided would be their bass player and current manager. At the sessions, the producer and the group approved all of the takes. When the album was completed, everyone involved felt we had created a wonderful recording.</p>
        <p>Several weeks later, Dave and Kelly approached me about wanting to re-record some of the tracks. I explained that this proposition was unfeasible, and two weeks later they informed me that we needed to scrap the whole project and start over. This was a disappointing and unrealistic proposal, to say the least. Chesky Records is considered to be one of the leading audiophile labels and we would never release a recording if it didn't measure up to our high musical and sonic standards. Not only was it frustrating that the group was unhappy with the sound quality, but it was financially unreasonable to re-record the entire session. How much should a small, independent label indulge its artists?</p>
        <p>Because we had invested thousands of dollars and a great amount of energy in this production, and we felt that we had produced a quality product alongside Dave's True Story, we saw it as a mistake not to release the album. The article implies that our releasing the album with the knowledge that the group was unhappy with it is an unprecedented event. However, this is really not that uncommon, and to imply that the group would have sued us if they had been equipped to do so presents the reader with the idea that they had a legal basis upon which to sue. Sue us for what? For trying to make the best record possible with the resources that we had?</p>
        <p>We completely and honestly feel that ''Unauthorized'' is a higher-quality recording than Dave's True Story's first effort on Chesky Records. The music is brilliant, and we believe that the production is equally brilliant. We stand by the product, and the critics from both the audiophile and mainstream press seem to agree. We will continue to manufacture and sell both ''Sex Without Bodies'' and ''Unauthorized,'' and ultimately it will rest with those who hear these albums to determine which recording is better.</p>
