        <p>Child-centered issues and politicking are now at center stage in presidential race, with candidates sometimes behaving as if they are auditioning for role of Santa Claus; politicians have always kissed babies, but it was Bill Clinton who built whole re-election campaign around children and empathy for working parents; photos of master at work (M)</p>

        <p>AT first glance, it was hard to say whether the scene looked more like a television chat show or a ''Saturday Night Live'' parody. There on a Washington stage last month sat Gov. George W. Bush, his wife, Laura, and two prominent Republican officeholders, both women, all in a semicircle and awaiting their first guest.</p>
        <p>On cue, out walked an adorable second grader with a giant white bow in her hair, along with one of her teachers. As the women beamed, Mr. Bush asked 7-year-old Elena Douglass, ''How is it here in the nation's capital? Are you having a good time?''</p>

        <p>AT first glance, it was hard to say whether the scene looked more like a television chat show or a ''Saturday Night Live'' parody. There on a Washington stage last month sat Gov. George W. Bush, his wife, Laura, and two prominent Republican officeholders, both women, all in a semicircle and awaiting their first guest.</p>
        <p>On cue, out walked an adorable second grader with a giant white bow in her hair, along with one of her teachers. As the women beamed, Mr. Bush asked 7-year-old Elena Douglass, ''How is it here in the nation's capital? Are you having a good time?''</p>
        <p>''Yes, sir, very,'' she whispered into her hand-held microphone.</p>
        <p>''Me too,'' confided Mr. Bush, who was using her to showcase his interest in literacy and foreign language instruction.</p>
        <p>Call it the infantilization of politics. Ever since President Clinton won re-election four years ago with child-centered issues like school uniforms, literacy and teenage smoking, candidates have increasingly behaved as if they are auditioning for the role of Santa Claus, and not running for public office.</p>
        <p>Yes, politicians have always kissed babies. And yes, even in 1988, both George Bush, the father, and Michael Dukakis were vying to be the education president. But it was Mr. Clinton who built a whole campaign around children, displaying his empathy for working parents by watching children make model airplanes, or dropping into a school that requires uniforms, or reading along with towheaded tykes.</p>
        <p>Bob Dole, his Republican opponent, once complained, ''You give President Clinton five minutes on television, he'll mention children 15 times.''</p>
        <p>This time around there are no complaints. Everybody's doing it. Just try to count how many times over the last year that Mr. Bush has read ''The Very Hungry Caterpillar'' to kindergartners to demonstrate his commitment to literacy. He said it was his favorite book from childhood -- no matter that it wasn't published until 1969, a year after he graduated from Yale.</p>
        <p>Or how about Al Gore in New Hampshire, where he not only knelt to read ''Tikvah Means Hope'' to 6-year-old Nikkita Gottling, but bought her the book and autographed it?</p>
        <p>These days, Mr. Gore can regularly be found in schools, eating in the cafeteria or sitting at a student's desk. This habit may even have raised the level of debate. At one high school, students were discussing the Plessy v. Ferguson case of 1896, in which the United States Supreme Court upheld the concept of separate but equal facilities for blacks and whites.</p>
        <p>Voters have put education and the decline of civic and cultural values at the top of their list of concerns. The boomers have made raising children an obsession, while more and more women voters are trying to balance motherhood and work.</p>
        <p>''If you will check out your Jeep Cherokee, you will see the vanity mirror is on both sides,'' said Alex Castellanos, a Republican political consultant. ''It's now on the driver's side and the soccer mom has her hand on the steering wheel. The soccer mom is 70 percent of consumer spending. Two out of three new college entrants are women. The economic power has shifted and she's still the key swing voter in suburban America.''</p>
        <p>What better way to play gender politics than by having a child on your lap? It  telegraphs warmth, empathy and understanding. ''Everyone who is running for office has to bend over backward to show that they know what it's like to be a typical American family,'' said Rachel Gorlin, a Democratic media consultant.</p>
        <p>Anyone who wanted a demonstration of the emotional power of an encounter with a child had only to watch Mr. Clinton hug a boy on crutches at the funeral for Cardinal John O'Conner, leaving the other dignitaries looking stiff and remote by comparison. Still, a few lonely voices in both parties deplore the dumbing down of political dialogue.</p>
        <p>''It atrophies the muscle of political debate,'' says Jeff Faux, a liberal Democrat at the Economic Institute, a Washington policy research center, who argues that it all started with Ronald Reagan's success with political imagery.</p>
        <p>William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, blames Mr. Clinton. ''The kid card is used as a trump and it trumps all debate,'' he said. ''You say this is good for our kids and that's the end of it, instead of here are the arguments for and against the measure.''</p>
        <p>Then again, Bill Bradley and John McCain, the primary candidates who ran on ''authenticity'' and ''substance,'' lost.</p>
        <p>In fact, politicians are using people as props more than ever. They hold small panel discussions with people who agree with them, to highlight some policy proposal. The elderly are paraded for discussion of Social Security. Nurses stand around listening to talk of health care.</p>
        <p>Most Republicans say they are delighted they have a nominee with some of Mr. Clinton's political skills and an ability to soften their party's image. ''Unfortunately, politics is about symbols and I don't even think you can overdo it,'' said David Horowitz, whose pamphlet ''The Art of Political War'' has been circulating among House Republicans.</p>
        <p>Several recent polls have shown Mr. Bush in the lead, and making a strong showing among married women, a swing group that Mr. Clinton won in 1996. So don't be surprised to see Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore surrounded by children, reading away like school librarians, right up to November.</p>
