        <p>Two years ago, Elie Samaha phoned John Travolta and told him he was going to make his dream come true. Travolta had never heard of him. ''I didn't know who Elie Samaha was,'' he recalls. ''And neither did my manager.''</p>

''Battlefield Earth'' had bounced around three studios but had been shelved again and again.

        <p>Two years ago, Elie Samaha phoned John Travolta and told him he was going to make his dream come true. Travolta had never heard of him. ''I didn't know who Elie Samaha was,'' he recalls. ''And neither did my manager.''</p>
        <p>Samaha, who owns Franchise Pictures, a company that finances and produces more than a dozen movies a year, wanted to meet with Travolta to discuss ''Battlefield Earth,'' a script based on L. Ron Hubbard's science-fiction novel. For more than 15 years, Travolta had been trying to get this movie, his pet project, off the ground. ''Battlefield Earth'' had bounced around three studios but had been shelved again and again. So many years had passed that Travolta switched from longing to play the youthful hero of the movie to setting his sights on the nine-foot villain with the cackling laugh -- and, yet, even after a string of $100 million box-office hits to his credit, Travolta could not get Hollywood to budge on ''Battlefield.''</p>
        <p>''I have a special affection for this book,'' says Travolta, who is a follower of Scientology, the religion that Hubbard originated when he was not turning out pulp fiction. ''Hubbard was a great writer, and I had an idea of the movie's potential, a fantasy in my mind that lasted for years.''</p>
        <p>When Samaha called, Travolta agreed to meet him for dinner at the Bel-Air Hotel. Samaha was looking to up his game from the $5 million movies he had been making at Franchise. He had read the script for ''Battlefield Earth'' and also saw potential: a big, controversial movie with a big profile in the industry; a big star, who is also a big star overseas; and a script that was ready to shoot. There was only one sticking point. ''I said, 'If John wants to make this movie, what does he want to get paid?''' Samaha recalls. ''Because I do not pay anybody what they make. That is not my business plan.''</p>
        <p>If ''Battlefield Earth'' had not been Travolta's dream, he would have demanded his usual $20 million. But dreams lead to compromise in Hollywood, and Samaha knows that. It is a key part of his business plan: scavenge and dig and find the script or project that a star most wants to make; finance it overseas; then shoot it in Canada to save money.</p>
        <p>Travolta's pet project arrived in theaters on Friday. The actor took a pay cut -- even investing $5 million of his own money when the production fell short -- but he is thrilled with how things turned out. ''Elie is primarily a financier,'' Travolta says. ''But he understands vision.''</p>
        <p>It is 10 minutes into the first quarter of the Lakers game, and Samaha will not sit down. Tonight, Franchise Pictures has six courtside seats on the floor of the Staples Center, and on this April evening Samaha has invited Sylvester Stallone, a producer named Mark Canton and John Ptak, a top senior agent at Creative Artists Agency who specializes in foreign financing, to join him at the game. Samaha, who at 43 looks like a taller, lankier Stallone, is dressed in black pants, black shirt, black tie and brown suede shoes, and he runs from seat to seat, attending to his guests. He gets them food, drinks, programs, tickets to the V.I.P. bar, to the skybox. In exchange, Samaha gets them.</p>
        <p>With the exception of Stallone, who is a longtime friend, none of Samaha's other guests would have recognized him five years ago. Then, he was known, if he was known at all, as the slightly shadowy guy who could get you into Roxbury, a club he owned on the Sunset Strip that became notorious when the actress Shannen Doherty got involved in a brawl there.</p>
        <p>But the business in Hollywood has shifted. These days, Samaha's skill at attracting foreign financing for movies with big stars has become highly attractive to the increasingly risk-averse studios. Whereas he used to seem vaguely sleazy, studios are now impressed by the scale of Samaha's ambition, by his knack for fostering favorite-orphan projects like ''Battlefield Earth'' and producing them at a price. So far, Franchise has undertaken, among others, ''The Big Kahuna'' (for Kevin Spacey), ''The Pledge'' (for Jack Nicholson and Sean Penn), ''Get Carter'' (for Stallone) and, most successfully, ''The Whole Nine Yards'' (for Bruce Willis). When everyone else said no or maybe or we'll see, Samaha said yes. He served the stars.</p>
        <p>Samaha chats his way down the row at the Staples Center: a hug for Michael Caine, a kiss blown to Pamela Anderson. There is something appealingly direct about his hustle. He is an easy, happy salesman who leaves the creativity -- the art of it all -- up to others. Samaha is a pure capitalist. He has made money with dry cleaners and his clubs and in real estate, but movies are more fun than a piece of property or a clean shirt. Like a latter-day Sam Goldwyn or Harry Warner, Samaha, who is Lebanese and learned English from watching Clint Eastwood films, views the movie business as the perfect job for an immigrant with drive: there are no class restrictions; there is no need for a formal education. ''In Hollywood, you only need success to have more success,'' Samaha explains, fussing over Stallone. ''People laughed at me. I didn't care. They didn't take me seriously. They didn't even return my calls three years ago.'' He pauses, briefly considering Shaquille O'Neal, who is passing the ball to Kobe Bryant. ''But I'm in the business to make money, and why would I hold a grudge? I mean, who the hell was Elie Samaha three years ago?''</p>
        <p>Part of Samaha's credibility with the Hollywood community comes from the box-office success of ''The Whole Nine Yards.'' Samaha produced the project when Warner Brothers was not interested. It was stuck in their library: studios commission and develop hundreds of scripts a year and only a handful get made; the rest languish in a movie purgatory known as ''turnaround.'' Samaha loves turnaround -- he can buy scripts stuck there for almost nothing, and often the scripts have been polished and tweaked (for better or for ill) at someone else's expense.</p>
        <p>''The Whole Nine Yards'' was personally important to Bruce Willis because it had been developed by his brother, David. To help keep costs low, Willis and the other principals deferred their usual salaries in lieu of a percentage of the final gross. So far, the movie has made $60 million domestically. Warner Brothers was amazed. Surprise success is a magic wand in Hollywood. It can smooth out rough edges and inspire faith. ''The Whole Nine Yards'' was just fluky enough to make people wonder if Samaha knew something they didn't.</p>
        <p>This is not to say that Samaha has arrived, exactly. ''Elie's first real test will be 'Battlefield Earth,''' John Ptak says. ''Elie listens and he's charming. But that stuff's all Act 1. This is a three-act business. Act 1 is style and personality and relationships. Act 2 is creating the avenues and highways to put the cars on. And Act 3 is creating the actual cars, which are the movies. You need all three acts to be successful. 'The Whole Nine Yards' proved something. We'll see if 'Battlefield Earth' can continue on that road.''</p>
        <p>It's getting close to halftime and, finally, Samaha sits down next to Ptak. He looks across the court. ''Those are Jack's seats,'' he says. Nicholson is not here. He's in Vancouver, shooting ''The Pledge,'' which Sean Penn is directing for Franchise. The movie is a dark character study about a retired policeman who becomes obsessed with the murder of a little girl. The script was developed at another company by Penn, who helped write it. When the production ran into problems, Samaha pounced. ''When Jack and I were negotiating his deal, I would look at him across the court and go, 'Thumbs up or thumbs down?''' he says, laughing. ''Jack is very funny. That is how he makes a deal.'' Samaha scans the rectangle for other points of power. ''This is my high,'' he says. ''I look around and all I see are friends.''</p>
        <p>At lunchtime on a Thursday in late March, Samaha is sitting at the conference table in his office daydreaming about the premiere of ''Battlefield Earth.'' He hasn't seen the completed film yet, but he is already planning the sequel. ''We kept the spaceship for the sequel,'' he says, as he eats a French fry from the coffee shop he owns next door. (''I don't eat birds,'' he explained earlier. ''I love birds, so I don't eat them. They're sad to eat. But I do love French fries.'') Samaha talks of his plan to bring the ''Battlefield'' spaceship down from its current home, a warehouse in Montreal, and park it in the middle of Hollywood Boulevard for the gala premiere of the movie. ''The ship is 60 feet wide and 40 feet high,'' Samaha says. ''Travolta will emerge from the ship. It's going to be great.''</p>
        <p>Samaha never had the same anxieties about ''Battlefield Earth'' that plagued the rest of Hollywood. Among executives, there was a free-floating worry that ''Battlefield Earth'' would have the taint of what many consider to be a cultlike religion. In fact, Hubbard wrote fiction before he created Scientology, and ''Battlefield Earth'' is a straightforward aliens-versus-humans kind of epic. The book is not an allegory -- the script lacks even the mythological overtones of ''Star Wars'' -- and is dismissed by hard-core science-fiction writers. ''Most people who know anything about science fiction think of Hubbard as a complete fraud,'' says the novelist John Kessel. ''Hubbard writes a kind of science fiction that we call 'thud and blunder,' stories for crackpots and juveniles.''</p>
        <p>The movie will not financially benefit Scientology, either. The rights to the book were acquired in the mid-1990's from Author Services Inc., a Los Angeles agency that handles Hubbard's fiction and is not affiliated with the church. Yet however tenuous the Scientology connection, Hollywood remained wary. ''It was risky,'' says one studio executive who passed on the project years ago. ''On any film there are 10 variables that can kill you. On this film there was an 11th: Scientology. It just wasn't something anyone really wanted to get involved with.''</p>
        <p>Travolta claims that no one ever mentioned Scientology to him. ''No executive ever brought it up,'' he maintains. ''I don't think it would have been appropriate protocol.'' Yet there is no question that Travolta's passion for the project stems from his belief in Scientology. He is not a science-fiction fan (''I guess I liked 'Stranger in a Strange Land,''' is all he can muster), and this movie has always been his homage to Hubbard.</p>
        <p>During the 90's, ''Battlefield Earth'' was shuffled from one studio to another, from MGM to Fox 2000 to Warner Brothers. The project looked permanently stalled. But a few years ago, Travolta saw a window on his calendar and told his manager, Jonathan Krane, that he wanted to make his movie.</p>
        <p>Samaha was told of Travolta's desire by Cassian Elwes, an agent at William Morris. Samaha had badgered Elwes for access to his big projects, projects that the studios had rejected. He saw a great opportunity to prove something.</p>
        <p>Samaha promptly secured a fluctuating credit line of up to $200 million from Imperial Bank in Los Angeles. With Travolta accepting a pay cut, and after other concessions, like shooting in Canada, the film's $90 million budget was slashed to $65 million. Over the next six months, Samaha raised 70 percent of the budget for ''Battlefield Earth'' by selling off overseas rights to the film. The international market for stars like Travolta, Willis and Stallone is consistent and huge. Increasingly, this is how movies -- especially expensive action movies with big stars -- are financed. ''Everyone needs a bridge to those foreign markets,'' Ptak explains, ''and Elie creates that bridge.'' Despite the qualms about the relationship between ''Battlefield Earth'' and Scientology, Samaha managed to secure major financial backing from Intertainment AG, a publicly held company in Germany, where hostility to the religion is widespread. Samaha recalls: ''I would yell at everyone, 'This is a science-fiction film starring John Travolta!' again and again.''</p>
        <p>As for Warner Brothers, which is now distributing the movie for Franchise, its gamble is minimal -- Samaha has done all the major financing for them. In fact, ''Battlefield Earth'' represents the consummation of three distinct agendas: Samaha gains credibility by pulling off a financing feat with a major star; Warner Brothers gets a big summer movie with little financial investment; and Travolta gets to realize his dream. No one, except Travolta and Krane, seems to care whether or not the film has any artistic merit.</p>
        <p>As Samaha sees it, creativity is up to the filmmakers. Other producers assume a greater role in the actual filmmaking: for instance, Harvey Weinstein is involved with nearly every aspect of any big Miramax film, from casting to script changes to the final edit. Samaha cedes all this to on-set personnel. In the case of ''Battlefield Earth,'' it was Travolta who approached Quentin Tarantino to direct; then, when Tarantino declined, he and Krane hired Roger Christian, who had shot second unit on ''Phantom Menace.'' They also hired the cinematographer, the art director and most of the principal actors.</p>
        <p>Travolta threw himself into the character of Terl, the evil Psyclo leader. ''There is no better villain than Terl,'' Travolta says with glee. ''It was fun. More than any other movie, I've been very involved in the technical aspects of this film, the special effects, the fantasy, the toys.'' He chuckles. ''I've been a 'Grease' toy, a Barbarino toy, a 'Saturday Night Fever' toy, a plate, a towel, a watch, a blanket. But I'm most excited about the Terl doll.''</p>
        <p>When Samaha is told this story in his office one afternoon, he laughs. ''I am glad that John is happy,'' he says, pointing to a stack of science-fiction magazines that have Terl and his dreadlocks and his strange breathing apparatus on the cover. ''This movie is so strong,'' Samaha says. He is reminded that he hasn't seen the finished version. ''I know,'' he says, tapping his forehead. ''It's going to be great.''</p>
        <p>Sylvester Stallone is standing in front of a table in Samaha's office staring at a series of potential posters for ''Get Carter,'' his next action movie. He is wearing a pearl gray sharkskin suit, and his skin is very tan and glows like burnished wood. Each poster is different -- in four, he is alone; in one, a mysterious woman hovers behind his shoulders; in another, a pair of catlike eyes stare over his head. Samaha is producing ''Get Carter'' and Stallone's next movie, his longtime dream project, a movie he has written about Formula One race car driving. ''Only we don't say 'Formula One,''' Samaha instructs. ''The name costs too much money.''</p>
        <p>''Which poster do you like?'' he asks Stallone, who is staring intently at the pictures. He picks the one with the girl. Samaha rushes over to a closet and pulls out an oversize pinup calendar. ''What do you think of this girl?'' he asks, parading one bikini shot after another. ''Isn't she incredible?'' he says of one dark-haired exotic girl. ''I am going to make her a star.'' Stallone nods and turns back to the posters. ''I can live with this one,'' he says, pointing to one of the solo shots, ''but you have to change my suit. I shouldn't be wearing this tweed jacket.'' Samaha claps Stallone on the back. ''Done,'' he says. ''We'll put you in silk.''</p>
        <p>Samaha walks Stallone down the hall. Franchise's walls are lined with posters for movies that few people have heard of: ''The White River Kid,'' ''Free Money,'' ''Confession.'' These films are the foundation of the company. Franchise has made dozens of low-budget movies. Some feature stars -- Marlon Brando is in ''Free Money'' and phoned Samaha personally to request Franchise's financial help. (At first, Samaha thought the call was a prank.) The movie, like many in Franchise's library, was never released in theaters, having gone straight to cable and video. There is a lot of money in that secondary business -- you shoot the film for five million and sell it for six -- but no prestige. There is a greater potential for financial failure with movies like ''Battlefield Earth'' or ''Get Carter,'' but Samaha was not happy staying on the fringes, however safe, of Hollywood.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to make bigger movies,'' he explains, returning after saying goodbye to Stallone. ''I wanted to make movies with major movie stars. There are only 30 stars in the world. If I have a Stallone movie, I know I can do $42 million internationally. If it's Meg Ryan, I can do 35. If it's Julia Roberts, I can do 45. And besides, actors are like good wine. You put them on the shelf and they're worth more. A movie with a star in it is good for my library. A library is worth money. It's very easy. It's my business.''</p>
        <p>Samaha settles into a chair. There are almost no personal details in his office: just three framed photos (his dog; his ex-wife, the actress Tia Carrere; his three nephews) and no computer on his desk. (''Computers are too slow,'' he explains.) ''I operate from the gut,'' Samaha continues. ''When I worked in the clubs, people said, 'Elie Samaha won't last a year.' They all went out of business and I succeeded. This taught me that you cannot listen to what people say. If you listen to what people say, you'll never advance in life.''</p>
        <p>Samaha moved to Los Angeles 18 years ago. Born in Beirut, he was 4 when his father died; Elie and his brother and sister were reared by their mother. He was athletic and joined the Lebanese Christian Army when he was 14. Instead of attending high school, Samaha flew off to London and Paris, where he managed the career of a girlfriend who was a model. ''We don't like to talk about her,'' Samaha demurs. ''She is now dating one of the most powerful men in the United States.''</p>
        <p>After working for a year in New York as a bouncer at Studio 54, Samaha migrated to Los Angeles in 1982. He read an article that listed ''the five most successful businesses to be in'' and settled on dry cleaning. ''I called my cleaner Celebrity Cleaners,'' Samaha says. ''I was open on Sunday, open until midnight. I got all my friends who were actors to autograph pictures for me. I found out that the studios paid a tremendous amount of money to dry-clean clothes. My idea was, in and out, fast service. I charged more, but I learned something: people will pay for service.''</p>
        <p>In four years, Samaha and his brother, who remains his partner, had 38 dry cleaners. They sold all except four businesses but kept the real estate. He now owns property all over Los Angeles, especially on Sunset Boulevard. ''My high comes from driving on Sunset and pointing at properties and saying, 'I own this' and 'I own this and that and this.''' He makes clever use of his properties too. For instance, his most recently acquired nightspot, the Sunset Room, has catered nearly all of Hollywood's movie premiere parties in the last six months -- including, of course, the one for ''The Whole Nine Yards.''</p>
        <p>To finance the club, he partnered with some of the top agents in town and other industry bigwigs. ''I don't want to be successful alone because people will be envious,'' Samaha explains. ''You can't go to war without an army behind you. One man cannot be a platoon.''</p>
        <p>He developed this strategy in 1990, when he -- and some partners -- bought what was once Preston Sturges's Players club; Samaha retitled it Roxbury, and the club was an instant scene. ''It was easy,'' he recalls. ''You'd call 80 percent of the girls and 20 percent of the guys. Charge the guys lots of money, the girls half price, add some celebrities and you have a club.'' Roxbury was a little louche -- it felt more like New York than L.A., which was part of its appeal -- and Samaha developed a slightly questionable reputation. ''We live in such a bland world, it's nice when someone has a little color,'' says a studio executive who went to Roxbury and now works with Samaha. ''But if Elie danced with the Devil, it's never affected his work.''</p>
        <p>The club presented Samaha with new possibilities: he met Tia Carrere there (''She stepped out of the car and I thought she was very beautiful, and the rest is history''), and he began making small movies starring her, filming them in places he owned, like the Roxbury parking lot and Celebrity Cleaners. ''I made my first film, 'The Immortals,' in 1995 for $1.8 million,'' Samaha recalls. ''It was about the yakuza. I sold it to October Films, to HBO and overseas. I made so much money on it, and I thought, This is a great business.''</p>
        <p>Samaha has since made many additional millions. What does he hope to do with it all? One dream is to build a spa on Sunset Boulevard called Heaven. ''It will have eight bungalows,'' he says, sounding enthralled. ''Mud from the Black Sea. The wraps, the massage, the wax, an attendant to take care of you at all times. This will be a spa like you've never seen in your life. Success, to me, will be the building of this spa.''</p>
        <p>The spa sounds loopy, but Samaha is undaunted when it comes to dreams. He is oblivious to obstacles. And like the men who built Hollywood, he cannot think small. Samaha's first partners in the movie business were Amir Malin and Avi Lerner at Millennium Films. They wanted to stay low end and low budget. (Malin eventually left and was a founder of Artisan Entertainment, which had enormous success with ''The Blair Witch Project.'') Samaha wanted Millennium to shift gears from cheap movies with B-list stars to large movies with top stars. His partners disagreed. ''They said, 'Quality doesn't pay.' I thought, Life's too short. And I went on my own. They were laughing at me, of course.''</p>
        <p>By wooing agents and studio executives and talent like Stallone and Willis, Samaha began forging powerful alliances. He sought out projects -- like ''The Big Kahuna'' with Kevin Spacey and ''3,000 Miles to Graceland,'' a heist movie set in Las Vegas that Kevin Costner wanted to make -- that had been languishing in one way or another. Samaha is always in player mode: he'll get together with the actor Tobey Maguire at his coffee shop for backgammon (''We play for meals'') or give a directing job to Jason Bloom, the son of Jake Bloom, a top entertainment lawyer, who represents Stallone.</p>
        <p>The stars Samaha has signed up impress everybody, from the studios to Imperial Bank, which, with a consortium of other banks, has upped Franchise's line of credit to $300 million. ''As long as Samaha maintains his relationships with talent,'' says Jared Underwood of Imperial Bank, ''we believe he can deliver.''</p>
        <p>But what happens when one of his movies fails at the box office? If ''Battlefield Earth'' is not a smash overseas, foreign investors could blanch when asked to invest in future Franchise projects. Similarly, Samaha's enthusiasm for the pet projects of big stars may not prove to be all that wise in the long run. Traditionally, dream projects often do not result in great or successful films. For every ''Dances With Wolves,'' there is a movie like Kevin Costner's other pet project, ''The Postman.'' Sandra Bullock may have been a hit in ''Speed,'' but a movie she helped green-light, ''Gun Shy,'' barely opened.</p>
        <p>Samaha does not seem worried, though. When the possibility of box-office failure is mentioned, he jumps up and goes to his desk. He opens a drawer and pulls out a chart showing all of John Travolta's movies and their domestic revenues. Most of his films, from ''Pulp Fiction'' to ''The General's Daughter,'' have grossed more than $100 million. The low point is ''Mad City,'' at $38 million. ''My projected numbers on 'Battlefield Earth' are really conservative,'' Samaha says, studying the chart. ''I'm already covered internationally, and there's no way I'm going to lose if the movie does $35 million domestically. And Travolta has never had an action movie do under $35 million.''</p>
        <p>Isn't he secretly hoping for a blockbuster? ''You can't be a jerk in this business,'' Samaha says. ''I'm looking to do a $15 million weekend on 'Battlefield Earth.' Fifteen is huge for me. My expectations are reasonable. And besides'' -- he smiles slightly -- this is just so fun. I'm going to have the party, and I own billboards, so we will have billboards for the movie. And I'll give away free dry cleaning and free meals at the Sunset Room on the radio. This movie will have great word of mouth.'' The smile turns broad. ''If I was a betting man, and I am, I would bet that this movie is going to change Franchise Pictures. On 'Battlefield Earth,' I can't lose.''</p>
        <p>During halftime at the Lakers game, Samaha heads into a dark V.I.P. bar that is nestled under the first tier of seats. An executive named Jim Miller grabs Samaha from behind. ''How's 'Battlefield Earth'?'' he asks. ''The movie is so strong.'' Samaha replies, even though he still hasn't seen the final version. ''It has so many fireworks. You're going to love it!''</p>
        <p>As Miller returns to the game, Samaha buys a bag of popcorn and continues: ''Opening this movie is like a fight. It's 'Battlefield Earth' versus 'Gladiator.' They come out first, but their May opening weekend is, historically, a $106 million weekend; my weekend is $150 million. They have Russell Crowe, but we have John Travolta. John Travolta is a bigger cheese. They have a $120 million budget and we have around 70. They have a better director in Ridley Scott. It's like a fight. We'll see who makes the bigger profit. I would bet on us,'' he says, smiling.</p>
        <p>Halftime is almost over -- the Lakers are beating the 76ers by 5 points -- and Samaha rushes back to his seat. He sits next to yet another of his guests, Michael Clarke Duncan, who was nominated for an Oscar for ''The Green Mile'' and was also a co-star in ''The Whole Nine Yards.''</p>
        <p>''Did you get the poster I sent you?'' Samaha asks Duncan, one hand on his huge shoulder. ''Yeah,'' Duncan laughs. ''I wasn't on the poster anymore. You whited me out. And that takes a lot of paint.''</p>
        <p>Nonplussed, Samaha smiles at his mistake. ''We'll get you another one tomorrow,'' he says. ''A bigger one.''</p>
        <p>As the second half begins, Samaha simultaneously studies the action on the court and the Hollywood players that sit on the perimeter. When a roving cameraman zooms in on Duncan, he yells out to him, ''Mention 'The Whole Nine Yards'!''</p>
        <p>A Staples Center attendant runs over to Duncan with a small piece of paper. It is the phone number of the Rock, the biggest draw of the World Wrestling Federation. He is sitting near the Lakers' bench and he wants Duncan to call him on his cell phone. Duncan smiles and waves across the court to the Rock, who is a mountainous but handsome man in a black suit and dark glasses.</p>
        <p>''Do you know the Rock?'' Samaha asks.</p>
        <p>''Yes,'' Duncan says, dialing the number. ''He's my oldest friend in L.A.''</p>
        <p>Samaha watches the Rock unclick his cell. ''How much does he make a year?'' Samaha asks. ''I hear he makes around $3 million.''</p>
        <p>Duncan is still pushing buttons, trying to get his call through. ''That's not much,'' Samaha continues. ''How about you two do a movie together? A buddy film.''</p>
        <p>Across the court, the Rock is cradling his tiny phone against his massive head, but the connection is shaky. ''Elie wants to know if we'll be in a buddy movie together,'' Duncan is saying into his cell. Duncan shakes his head. ''We can't make the deal, Elie,'' he says. ''He can't hear me.'' Amused by Samaha's endless dance, Duncan throws his arm around Samaha's shoulder. ''This guy is Hollywood,'' he exclaims. ''You never stop.''</p>
        <p>Samaha views this as a compliment, but he's on a mission. ''You and the Rock together will be bigger than anything -- bigger than 'Battlefield Earth.'''</p>
        <p>Duncan smiles. ''And just how big will that be?''</p>
