        <p>DAN MAJERLE heard a whistle and looked at Hue Hollins the way Scottie Pippen and Phil Jackson once did, with incredulity and rage. A foul? You called that a foul?</p>
        <p>Yes, a reach-in foul 20 feet from the basket, contact with Patrick Ewing that SETI might not have detected, with 2 seconds on the shot clock and 13.6 seconds in overtime and the Knicks and Heat, after 52 minutes 46.4 seconds, still tied at the bargain-basement score of 75.</p>
        <p>''First of all, I really didn't hit him,'' Majerle would say after fate had heard his case and adjudicated in his favor. ''And that's a tough call to make with the game on the line.''</p>
        <p>Ewing missed a free throw. Anthony Carter made what may very well have been an illegal shot from the Dolan family seating area and no-trespassing zone. The 41 minutes to which Majerle had sacrificed a couple more octogenarian years of jogging by the beach front were not lost in the final entanglement of angles and issues, in Miami's 77-76 victory in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference semifinals.</p>
        <p>The box score couldn't tell us all we needed to know about Majerle and Allan Houston, about an exhaustive perimeter dance most reflective of a series that perhaps will not be decided by sheer talent after all. The box score could only tell us that Houston had come home with his best game, 24 points on 9 of 18 from the field. He had ignited an explosion of sound in Madison Square Garden with a face-up 3-pointer that gave the Knicks a 73-71 overtime lead and left an exasperated Majerle staring at his bench and wondering how much more of Houston's release space he could steal. ''I've been saying for a while now that he's my toughest cover,'' Majerle would say. ''Once he gets his legs under him, he can just go up and score from anywhere.''</p>
        <p>Daniel Lewis Majerle, born Sept. 9, 1965, in Traverse City, Mich., has never been a great professional basketball player. Like most of the very good contemporary white players, his reputation has at times exceeded his game. At his very best in the early 1990's, in Phoenix, he was worth about 17 points, 6 rebounds and 3 assists a game. They called him Thunder Dan. He could shoot from way out and had a strong, purposeful stride. He relished a defensive challenge and didn't back away from the matchup with Michael Jordan in the 1993 National Basketball Association finals.</p>
        <p>''Thunder Dan, my behind,'' Jordan snapped when the series was over and Majerle had measured a clear second to a true basketball great.</p>
        <p>Majerle played basketball in those days the way Lenny Dykstra played baseball, and he, too, paid for his abandon with injuries, with a body sapped too soon of offensive skill. He left Phoenix, unhappily, for Cleveland. He migrated south to Miami, just in time for the start of the Knicks-Heat wars. He is 34 now, healthy again, but with more clouds than thunder in his sinewy 6-foot-6-inch frame. On the final possessions of a long, draining night, Houston became obscured in Majerle's defensive cloud.</p>
        <p>Oh, how the Knicks wanted the ball in the pure shooter's hands, leading by 75-73, needing a basket to put Miami away, maybe once and for all, after pushing into overtime on Ewing's clutch jumper. Latrell Sprewell had given up his dribble out front. Houston tried desperately to create a passing lane.</p>
        <p>Majerle would not give him room. The Knicks took a timeout, and ultimately settled for a shot they didn't want, a missed Marcus Camby drive.</p>
        <p>Alonzo Mourning tied the score with a baseline jumper. Now here came the Knicks, waiting for Houston to break free of Majerle, again on the left side. And Majerle wouldn't let Houston get away, wouldn't let him breathe. The shot clock ran down. Ewing turned the ball over.</p>
        <p>''Amazing,'' Jack Ramsay, the former Portland coach and Miami television analyst, would say. ''How often do you see defense where the guy can't even go out 20 feet from the basket and get the ball?''</p>
        <p>P. J. Brown knew why.</p>
        <p>''When you come down to this point of your career,'' he said, ''every game becomes the game of your life.''</p>
        <p>In career twilight, Majerle has become, more than any other player, more so with each passing season, the embodiment of Pat Riley's Heat. There is no champion in this team. In Majerle, there is only the heart of one.</p>
        <p>The Heat has the Knicks good and scared going into Game 4 today. Miami is an outfit patched together with sticks and glue, with offensive alignments that could be a Regis question for $1 million.</p>
        <p>Which of the following Heat players is capable of scoring a basket in a crucial half-court set? a) Otis Thorpe. b) Anthony Carter. c) Bruce Bowen. d) Dan Majerle.</p>
        <p>Given the circumstances of his defensive attrition, Riley could forgive Majerle's 1-for-6 shooting Friday night. He did have a game-high seven assists and six rebounds and, of course, the final answer for Houston on defense. And Carter somehow found the basket, negating the cheap call that put Ewing on the line.</p>
        <p>Majerle wasn't tired, he said afterward, but he was counting on ''being exhausted'' by morning. If he were home, he would have played 18 holes after practice yesterday. He would instead spend the afternoon and evening relaxing, eating right, getting ready for Houston in Game 4, which is a game the Knicks, of course, are certain to win because Miami and Majerle cannot keep this up.</p>
        <p>They can't, right?</p>
