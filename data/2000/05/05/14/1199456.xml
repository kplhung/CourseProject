        <p>The past is inexhaustible in Germany. Beyond each confrontation with the Third Reich, a new accounting always lurks. This time it was the turn of the army, which has tended to cling to the notion that Hitler's crimes were the work of the SS and death squads, not the Wehrmacht.</p>
        <p>Turning his back on such views, Defense Minister Rudolf Scharping stripped a base of the name of a Wehrmacht general long regarded as a hero and renamed it after Anton Schmid, a sergeant who was executed by the Nazis in 1942 after he disobeyed orders and helped Jews in the Vilnius ghetto. Honoring him reflected Germany's growing determination to place ''Zivilcourage'' -- the courage of conscience -- above duty in its scale of values.</p>

        <p>''I merely behaved as a human being,'' Sergeant Schmid wrote in his last letter to his wife. But very few people in Hitler's Reich had the courage to do that.</p>
