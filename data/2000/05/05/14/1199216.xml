      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Almost one year ago to the day, in a Brooklyn neighborhood that sounds very similar to the one where Stephen S. Hall lives, I was attacked by five youths as I walked home from work (Lives, April 16). It was a typical scenario: they said they had a gun and demanded that I hand over my money. I refused. Having spent the previous eight hours hauling food for a party of well-fed writers or some other group of beautiful, rude people, I felt that I had worked very hard for the hundred or so bucks in my pocket and deserved it more than my teenage muggers did. I resisted, we struggled and I lost my jacket, catering tuxedo, wallet and keys. The kids ran into the projects. I followed them onto the basketball court-playground and collected my knapsack, which was torn to pieces, then walked a block home to my apartment.</p>
        <p>I realize that I made my choice and paid the price. I didn't hit any of them, but fought them off, taking 20 to 30 blows, one of which broke my jaw.</p>

        <p>Almost one year ago to the day, in a Brooklyn neighborhood that sounds very similar to the one where Stephen S. Hall lives, I was attacked by five youths as I walked home from work (Lives, April 16). It was a typical scenario: they said they had a gun and demanded that I hand over my money. I refused. Having spent the previous eight hours hauling food for a party of well-fed writers or some other group of beautiful, rude people, I felt that I had worked very hard for the hundred or so bucks in my pocket and deserved it more than my teenage muggers did. I resisted, we struggled and I lost my jacket, catering tuxedo, wallet and keys. The kids ran into the projects. I followed them onto the basketball court-playground and collected my knapsack, which was torn to pieces, then walked a block home to my apartment.</p>
        <p>I realize that I made my choice and paid the price. I didn't hit any of them, but fought them off, taking 20 to 30 blows, one of which broke my jaw.</p>
        <p>The thing that really angered me, though, was the reaction of my 20 or more neighbors who were on the playground at the time of the incident. No one tried to intervene; no one called the police. No anonymous 911 call from an apartment in the projects or in the brownstones across the street. Nice lesson in civics.</p>
        <p>The only people who gave a damn were the plainclothes officers who arrived at my apartment after I called 911. They drove me around, asked me if I could identify any of the kids and were generally sympathetic. They followed up with me for a month or two, and because I didn't want to finger the wrong person, I let it go.</p>
        <p>The tragedies that have occurred in the recent months of plainclothes officers shooting unarmed people have been just that, tragedies. For Hall to paint the plainclothes officers in his neighborhood as power-mad, trigger-happy, slam-'em -on-the-concrete cowboys is shortsighted and simplistic. I hope that he and his wife, baby sitter and child never find themselves in a situation where they need the help of these officers. It ain't fun, let me tell you.</p>
