        <p>The serious patrons of Beijing's Panjia-yuan Antiques and Curios Market, better known as the ''Dirt Market,'' all go at the same time: Just after dawn on Saturday.</p>
        <p>By 6:15 a.m. this semicovered market -- covering several acres just inside the east Third Ring Road -- is humming with hawkers and shoppers seeking everything from Ming and Qing dynasty vases to old gramophones and clocks, bronze figures and jade carvings, snuff bottles, embroidered silk robes, old books and coins, wooden chests and paintings.</p>
        <p>Most of the objects resemble those found in any of Beijing's curio markets, and many of the ''antiques'' really aren't. But they can sure look the part, and if you bargain hard you can find novel items at great prices. And the atmosphere is infinitely more exotic than that of, say, the multistory Curio City nearby or the state-operated Friendship Store.</p>
        <p>The market is open every Saturday and Sunday from dawn to about 1:00 p.m. But what attracts Beijing's antiques dealers -- and gets them out of bed so early -- is the large uncovered area off to the side, literally on the dirt, where hundreds of traders in ceramics and other objects hold forth. A surprisingly large share of the vases and bowls really are old, though it takes an expert eye to tell. Depending on rarity and condition, 200-year-old vases may cost anywhere from $40 to more than $1,000, with lots of handsome items on the low side. Many of the pieces offered here will end up on sale in places like Curio City for two or three times the price.</p>
