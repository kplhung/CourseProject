        <p>''IT'S TIME for ''Fiscal Jeopardy.''</p>
        <p>The first answer is: About $3.5 trillion, and falling rapidly.</p>
        <p>The correct question is: What is the national debt?</p>
        <p>The next answer: About $5.6 trillion and rising rapidly.</p>
        <p>The question: What is the national debt?</p>
        <p>Confused? Well, there are going to be many confusing claims and counterclaims emanating from the presidential campaign trail in the next few months about who will do more to put the federal government's finances in order. And they start with very different definitions of the debt.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore puts his emphasis on the national debt held by the public, the $3.5 trillion that the government has borrowed by selling Treasury securities to individual investors, banks, pension funds and foreign governments.</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas is taking the view that the government's obligations include not just the public debt, but also the special bonds it is issuing to the Social Security system in ever-growing amounts, representing promises to pay retirement benefits in decades ahead. By that accounting, the current $5.6 trillion in total debt will grow inexorably for years to come.</p>
        <p>The differences are coming into play as the candidates hurtle into a high-intensity debate about how to shore up Social Security in time for the aging of the baby boomers.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has made paying off the entire public debt by 2013 the centerpiece of his economic agenda. He wants to use excess Social Security revenue -- more than $2 trillion over the next decade -- to do it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore would then channel the interest savings from debt reduction to Social Security, in effect committing trillions of dollars of general tax revenue to keep the system afloat. In that way, he would extend the system's solvency from 2037 to around 2050 without cutting benefits, raising payroll taxes or altering the way Social Security works.</p>
        <p>In addition to helping deal with Social Security in a relatively painless way, Mr. Gore's plan would free up trillions of dollars for other kinds of investment, helping to put downward pressure on interest rates and create new economic opportunities for companies and individuals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's approach is different. This week he plans to set out a goal of adding private investment accounts to Social Security, a major change that would require hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of dollars over the next decade. The only place to find that money is the Social Security surplus.</p>
        <p>To the extent that the surplus is used to finance private accounts, it would not be available to reduce the public debt, a goal in which Mr. Gore sees both economic logic and considerable political appeal.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush's team argues that reducing the public debt is not the only way to improve the government's financial condition. Because the private investment accounts would replace part of the government's obligation to pay Social Security benefits in the long run, his approach would in effect reduce the debt, broadly defined.</p>
        <p>''You'd be improving the government's balance sheet in an even more efficient way,'' said Lawrence B. Lindsey, the former Federal Reserve governor who is Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser.</p>
        <p>The scale of any reduction in total debt under Mr. Bush's approach would depend on the amount of money committed to the private accounts, a decision that Mr. Bush says should be made through bipartisan negotiations after he is elected.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Gore's approach, the public debt would sink steadily, but all the while the Treasury's obligation to the Social Security trust fund would be rising even faster, from $855 billion today to $4.2 trillion in 2013. So even if the public debt is retired on Mr. Gore's schedule, the total debt would rise, from $5.6 trillion today to $6.8 trillion in 2013.</p>
        <p>The two plans are pretty much a wash when it comes to improving national savings. ''Whether you're taking $100 billion and buying down debt or adding it to a pool of private funds available for investment doesn't make a great deal of difference,'' said Robert D. Reischauer, president of the Urban Institute and a former director of the Congressional Budget Office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's approach is conservative in the sense that it is based on debt reduction, but it affirms Democratic orthodoxy by retaining Social Security as a guaranteed benefit, even if tax revenue must pay for it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush bucks mainstream economic thinking to a degree when he plays down the importance of wiping out the public debt. But at heart, his plan is about transferring some control of retirement finances from the government to individuals -- a most basic conservative value.</p>
        <p>We'll be back with the final round of ''Fiscal Jeopardy'' in November, when the voters will decide.</p>
