        <p>More than a half-century since they braved enemy fire after first enduring the contempt of their own countrymen, 21 servicemen have been awarded the nation's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor, for heroism during World War II.</p>

        <p>More than a half-century since they braved enemy fire after first enduring the contempt of their own countrymen, 21 servicemen have been awarded the nation's highest military decoration, the Medal of Honor, for heroism during World War II.</p>
        <p>All 21 were of Asian descent, and 19 were Japanese-Americans, some of whose fathers and mothers, brothers and sisters were interned behind barbed wire in the days of fear and prejudice that followed the attack on Pearl Harbor.</p>
        <p>''We are privileged to properly honor the heroic actions of these brave soldiers,'' Louis Caldera, the secretary of the Army, said in making the announcement on Friday. The medals will be presented by President Clinton at a White House ceremony scheduled for June 21.</p>
        <p>One of the 21 honored was Senator Daniel K. Inouye, Democrat of Hawaii. As a 20-year-old lieutenant, he was gravely wounded in Italy on April 21, 1945, while leading his platoon in an attack on a Fascist bunker. He lost his right arm, and with it his dream of being a surgeon.</p>
        <p>''I am deeply grateful to my nation for this extraordinary award,'' the senator said in a statement. ''If I did well, much of the credit should go to my parents, grandparents and the gallant men of my platoon. This is their medal. I will receive it on their behalf.''</p>
        <p>Most of the 21 are not as well known as Mr. Inouye. They were among the millions of young Americans from classrooms and shops, cities and prairies who went to war. But the Japanese-Americans felt they had something to prove, and several thousand of them did, leaving American internment camps to become volunteers, most notably in the 442nd Regimental Combat Team.</p>
        <p>Fighting in Europe, the 442nd became known as ''the Purple Heart battalion'' for the casualties it suffered. The 442nd fought in eight major campaigns in Italy, France and Germany. The unit suffered more than 800 casualties in the fall of 1944 as it rescued 211 members of a Texas unit pinned down by the Germans in southern France, a battle known in military legend as ''the rescue of the lost battalion.''</p>
        <p>The 442nd was awarded thousands of citations, including 9,500 Purple Hearts and 52 Distinguished Service Crosses, the second-highest military honor. By war's end, military historians say, it was the most decorated unit in American military history.</p>
        <p>But the victory was far from complete. Japanese-American veterans encountered prejudice when they came home. And why, some people asked as the years went by, were only two Asian-Americans awarded the Medal of Honor for World War II combat, especially if 104 rated the Distinguished Service Cross?</p>
        <p>In 1996, Senator Daniel K. Akaka, Democrat of Hawaii, saw that a provision was written into a military-programs bill calling for the Army and Navy to review the 104 Distinguished Service Cross citations to gauge whether any recipients had been unfairly denied the Medal of Honor.</p>
        <p>Inquiries determined that the 21 honored on Friday -- during Asian Pacific American Heritage Month -- indeed deserved the star-spangled, pale blue ribbon and gold medallion of the Medal of Honor.</p>
        <p>Most of the 21 were members of the famed 442nd. One who was not is Richard B. Davila. As a young Army officer, he saw combat in France and Italy. On one occasion, he emptied three ammunition boxes firing a machine gun at Germans barricaded in a house, then charged the building and lobbed in hand grenades. When all went quiet, he said, he knew he had done his job.</p>
        <p>''It seems funny, telling you all of this,'' he said wistfully as the years dropped away.</p>
        <p>He was only slightly hurt that day in 1944. But not long afterward, he was wounded in the right arm and chest. He spent years in medical treatment and never regained use of the arm. But he went to college, studied science, got his master's degree. Mr. Davila married, had five children and retired after 25 years of teaching in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Now 84, he looks back on a good life and looks forward to the White House ceremony. His children and grandchildren will be there. His wife will not. She died on Christmas Day.</p>
        <p>''She would have been thrilled,'' Mr. Davila said with a catch in his voice.</p>
        <p>Here are the men who were awarded the Medal of Honor:</p>
        <p>Rudolph Davila, Barney Hajiro, Mikio Hasemoto (posthumous), Joe Hayashi, Shizuya Hayashi, Daniel Inouye, Yeiki Kobashigawa, Robert Kuroda (posthumous), Kiyoshi Marunaga and Kaoru Moto (posthumous).</p>
        <p>Masato Nakae (posthumous), Shinyei Nakamine (posthumous), William Nakamura (posthumous), Joe Nishimoto (posthumous), Allan Ohata, Yukio Okutsu, Frank Ono (posthumous), Kazuo Otani (posthumous), George Sakato, Ted Tanouye (posthumous) and Francis Wai (posthumous).</p>
