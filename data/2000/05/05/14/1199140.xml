        <p>FAR FROM RUSSIA</p>
        <p>A Memoir.</p>
        <p>By Olga Andreyev Carlisle.</p>
        <p>182 pp. New York:</p>

        <p>The volatile mix of poetry, politics, cultural crossbreeding and social upheaval that marks Olga Carlisle's life inevitably calls to mind the great tradition of 20th-century Russian autobiography: Mandelstam, Tsvetayeva, Pasternak, Nabokov and, more recently, Andre Makine. Carlisle herself mentions Pasternak's autobiographical ''Safe Conduct'' in her own ''Far From Russia.''</p>
        <p>But such comparisons do her no favors. The bare facts of her life promise more than her memoir can deliver. She is, as she repeatedly reminds us, the granddaughter of the well-known writer Leonid Andreyev, who died in exile shortly after the Russian Revolution. She was raised in Paris by parents who'd been formed by the political and artistic turmoil of early-20th-century Russian culture. Isaac Babel and Marina Tsvetayeva were family friends. And Carlisle herself has actively worked to promote Russian culture over the last three decades through her work as author, editor and translator -- not to mention her efforts to bring dissident writings like Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's ''First Circle'' and ''Gulag Archipelago'' to the attention of the West. She seems to have met everyone who's anyone at some point during her multicontinental career. But her references seldom go far beyond rapid-fire name-dropping and bland generalities:</p>
        <p>''Jackson Pollock, Franz Kline, David Smith, Willem de Kooning, Philip Guston, Ad Reinhardt . . . each in his own way was charismatic,'' she informs us. Elizabeth Hardwick possessed ''a brilliant critical mind that expressed itself in a fireworks of shimmering literary insights.''</p>
        <p>Carlisle's background seems to have provided a point of contact with many of the artists she meets. But the conclusions she draws are seldom illuminating. Robert Lowell and Mark Rothko establish their cultural credentials by recognizing her literary pedigree: she quickly ascertains that both ''knew the works of my grandfather.'' Rothko's fascination with Tolstoy's last days reflects, she comments, ''his growing inner despair, the void looming behind the shimmering surface of his pictures.''</p>
        <p>Carlisle began her career as a painter. ''When Norman Mailer asked me the meaning of my painting flowers I had the presence of mind to say that they stood for sex, which pleased him,'' she recalls. Her erstwhile teacher Robert Motherwell was less appreciative of her gifts; he tacitly encouraged her to give up painting, though he later conceded that she ''did become a good writer.''</p>
        <p>Carlisle's memoir suggests otherwise. The cliches and clumsy prose that mark her comments on artists and writers are typical of the book at large. She spends many pages on the affair that would eventually lead to her marriage with the American writer Henry Carlisle. The erotic adventures of an attractive Russian painter and a handsome California poet in Paris sound like promising material: certainly Anas Nin made much of similar encounters. But the lovers' dialogue alternates between clunky exposition and what too often sounds like a French-Russian Harlequin romance in awkward English translation:</p>
        <p>'' 'Yes, the French are stupid,' Henry said. 'Most of the century's disasters can be directly blamed on them. World War II, for instance. Had they been less vindictive in 1918, it may not have happened.'</p>
        <p>'' 'But German militarism . . .' I said.</p>
        <p>''Suddenly Henry's eyes darkened. 'As for those Frenchmen last night, they acted as if they knew you intimately. Which one is your lover -- or both?' ''</p>
        <p>Many key scenes take place at cocktail parties and soirees set everywhere from Paris and Peredelkino to Nantucket and New York. The book's own scattershot structure and frantic name-dropping finally evoke the self-absorbed artistic chitchat of such gatherings more successfully than they do the cultural and political milieus molding a life that must have been more interesting to lead than it is to read about.</p>
