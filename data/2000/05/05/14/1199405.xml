        <p>AFTER studying civil engineering at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, O. Winston Link went on to become a celebrated photographer of railroads and bridges. The photo at left, depicting cable-spinning for construction of the Triborough Bridge in 1935, with the Hell Gate Bridge in the background, shows his dedication to working in challenging field conditions.</p>
        <p>''Bridges and Rails: Photographs by O. Winston Link'' is on view at an appropriate site: the New York Transit Museum Gallery in Grand Central Terminal. The exhibition displays more than 50 images from the mid-1930's to the late 1960's. There are shots of the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge under construction (in 1963 and 1964) and a never-published photo essay, ''Triborough From High Places'' (1965-1968). The Norfolk and Western Railway series (1955-1960) documents the end of the nation's last fully steam-powered rail line.</p>
