        <p>Westchester County Democratic Party names former Scarsdale trustee Amy Paulin as candidate for New York State Assemblywoman Audry G Hochberg's seat; Republican hopefuls are Max DiFabio, Maria Munoz-Kantha and former Bronxville Mayor Marcia Lee (S)</p>

        <p>Amy Paulin, a former Scarsdale village trustee, is the County Democratic Party's choice to replace Audrey G. Hochberg, the State Assemblywoman from the 88th District, who is retiring. Mrs. Hochberg, 66, has represented Pelham, Eastchester, Scarsdale and parts of Mount Vernon, New Rochelle and White Plains since 1992. Ms. Paulin, 44, was interim executive director of My Sisters' Place, a shelter for battered women, until she stepped down recently to run for office. James E. Cavanaugh, Westchester Republican Party chairman, said three people were interested in the G.O.P. nomination, to be decided May 24 at the party's convention at the County Center: Max DiFabio, an Eastchester businessman; Maria Munoz-Kantha, a White Plains resident who unsuccessfully ran for the Board of Legislators in 1997; and former Mayor Marcia Lee of Bronxville.</p>
