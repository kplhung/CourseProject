        <p>MICHAEL FRAYN'S play ''Copenhagen'' arrived on Broadway last month, a three-character drama about the philosophical implications of quantum physics that Ben Brantley, chief theater critic for The New York Times, called ''the most invigorating and ingenious play of ideas in many a year.'' But does anyone understand it?</p>
        <p>Mr. Frayn imagines the conversations that might have taken place between the physicists Niels Bohr and Werner Heisenberg, on a night in 1941 when the men met in German-occupied Copenhagen. Bohr had developed the ''old quantum theory'' of atomic matter; Heisenberg announced the famous uncertainty principle in 1927. These and 22 other dates and theorems are in a timeline (written by Mr. Frayn) contained in a Playbill foldout. Sample entry: ''THE WAVE EQUATION. 1926 Schrodinger finds the mathematical equation for the wave interpretation, and proves that wave and matrix mechanics are mathematically equivalent.''</p>
        <p>Uh huh. Not since Tom Stoppard threw together James Joyce, Lenin and Tristan Tzara in ''Travesties'' in 1975 have audience brows been lifted quite so high.</p>
        <p>Mr. Frayn uses the Bohr-Heisenberg meeting, and the uncertainty principle, to show the unknowability of all things. But  what is the uncertainty principle?</p>
        <p>We put that question to some members of the audience at a performance of ''Copenhagen'' and to several people involved with the production, as well as one genuine scientist. No Cliff Notes allowed.</p>
        <p>Victor Grisiatis, freelance press agent: ''Oh, jeez. You're talking to the wrong person.'' Mr. Grisiatis looked in panic at his companion outside the Royale theater during intermission at Wednesday's matinee. Nonetheless, he bravely advanced a definition. ''You can never predict. You can only take an educated guess on certain things. Is that about right? Science was never my strong point.''</p>
        <p>Drew Hodges, creative director:  ''I understand what he's telling me to understand, but I don't understand how a particle can be a wave and a particle.'' Mr. Hodges works at SPOTco, the design studio that produced the Playbill timeline. He recalled Jeff Goldblum in the movie ''The Lost World,'' saying that the  uncertainty principle meant something like, ''You can't study a thing without changing it.'' He said: ''It's like on Broadway there'll be someone someone hates and someone someone loves, depending on your experience of that person.''</p>
        <p>Joseph Vanarendonk, retired United Nations official: ''You cannot identify a particle at the same  time,'' he said, drawing thoughtfully on a pipe at Wednesday's matinee. ''In other words, the movement, if you want to freeze it in time, then it is a particle. But, if you want to understand. . . . Let me put it this way. . . . It's quite difficult to conceptualize. You can identify you by placing you in time and place. The particle you cannot put at the same time in the same time and place. And that is the uncertain--'' he cut himself off.</p>
        <p>Anonymous audience member: ''I'm very distracted by all the noise here on the street,'' she said, struggling to explain uncertainty. ''I don't understand it, no. Are you recording this?''</p>
        <p>Michael Cumpsty, who plays Heisenberg: ''I would say it means you can't know the location and velocity of a particle at the same time, or, to extrapolate, in its theoretical form, as Heisenberg says in the play, of anything,'' he said. ''If you want to understand the physics you're going to have to go off and read a book,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Brian Greene, author of ''The Elegant Universe'' and a professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University: ''As developed in 1927 by Heisenberg, it tells us there's a fundamental  limitation about and on what we can possibly know about the microscopic realm -- where something is and how fast something is moving,'' he said. ''We can't know both of these things with absolute precision.'' As for Mr. Frayn's science, ''It looked good to me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Michael Frayn, playwright: While the play was in previews in New York he received a letter from a confused audience member who wrote that ''She couldn't understand a word of the science and if I didn't remove it, the play wouldn't last long on Broadway,'' he said.</p>
