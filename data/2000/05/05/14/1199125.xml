        <p>As a destination, the town of Sintra and its surrounding countryside come thunderously endorsed. Poets have waxed lyrical about this privileged enclave of Portugal, northwest of Lisbon.</p>
        <p>Lord Byron tarried here briefly and wrote in ''Childe Harold's Pilgrimage'' that he had discovered ''glorious Eden.'' Robert Southey called Sintra ''the most blessed spot in the habitable globe.''</p>
        <p>By the time they arrived, this dark thorny promontory rearing out of the Atlantic to an elevation of 1,736 feet had been attracting people for eons. Some claim it projects a powerful tellurian emanation, an eerie spiritual magnetism that once caused astral cults to gravitate to its grottoes and caves. Pre-Christian Celts flocked here to venerate 1,000-year-old trees. They left behind cromlechs and menhirs, the remains of which, bearded with lichen and moss, still litter the hillsides. The Romans called this magical zone the Mountain of the Moon. In the eighth and ninth centuries, Muslims constructed a castle whose crenelated ramparts continue to brood above the town, and medieval monks and nuns cloistered themselves in sylvan convents and monasteries.</p>
        <p>I came to Sintra for secular reasons. Sick of the crowds in southern France, my wife, Linda, and I retreated to a spot renowned for its beneficent climate, romantic fogs and lonely melodramatic beaches. In this respect, we were following the example of the Portuguese royal family, who, as far back as the late 14th century, abandoned Lisbon during the summer and set up court where the temperature is often 20 degrees cooler, even though just 20 miles away. Aristocrats tagged after the royals, taking up residence on rural estates. While some of their homes were only a shade less sumptuous than the National Palace, others were working farms with handsome manor houses and stone outbuildings. These country estates were called quintas, because, in theory, a fifth of the land belonged to the king.</p>
        <p>Well into the 20th century, tradition dictated that a gentleman out for a stroll could call at any quinta and count on hospitality fit for a noble. These days, however, the footpaths are overgrown with brambles, and anyone who wanders onto private property encounters high walls and barking dogs. But along a perilously narrow secondary road that slithers downhill from Sintra to the village of Colares, a handful of quintas welcome paying guests. The accommodations range in price and splendor from the baronial Seteais Palace to the down-home Quinta de Sao Thiago, which resembles the setting of a Tennessee Williams play.</p>
        <p>We reserved a cottage on the grounds of Quinta da Capela. According to our directions, it was simple to reach, lying halfway between Colares and Sintra. On the day we approached the quinta in our rented Renault Safrane, the sky was bright and dense with pollen. The twisting road ducked into a tunnel of trees, emerged into a blinding light, then plunged back into darkness. My wife, clutching the dashboard, oohed and aahed at the beauty. I, when not in stomach-flipping fear of onrushing traffic, operated on automatic pilot. I swerved around horse carts, avoided -- barely -- motorcyclists as leathery black as crows and had my side-view mirror ripped off by a hurtling BMW.</p>
        <p>After so many close calls on this and subsequent trips on the same road, how can I recommend that others chance it? Well, truth to tell, the road turned out to be the reason for the area's unspoiled beauty, pure air and privacy. Municipal officials have evidently decided that improvements will just bring in a glut of tour buses, overburden local resources and ruin the environment. In short, the harrowing, hairpin, fusilli-shaped spiral of disintegrating asphalt keeps the habitat intact, keeps prices low and kept us happy at Quinta da Capela.</p>
        <p>Built in the 16th century by the Duc de Cadaval, the quinta was destroyed in the earthquake of 1755 and rebuilt in 1773. Still privately owned, it is run by Arturo Silva da Pereira and Marc Zrcher, low-key fellows who create the pleasant illusion that each guest is in charge of his personal quinta. There is the equally appealing illusion that the place has remained a colonial retreat, not a plush gussied-up resort. The main house, which has accommodations for 14 guests, is a long stone structure patinated with age and topped by a swaybacked red-tile roof. Furnished with rustic antiques and brightened by Arturo's paintings, the rooms, like the three cottages on the grounds, have distinctly different layouts and decors. Recorded classical music plays nonstop in the library-sitting room, and a self-service honor bar remains open all day in the salon. There's a workout room and a sauna, but I never saw anybody perspiring in either place.</p>
        <p>Tucked into a corner of the property, a swimming pool gleams. Elfin rather than Olympic-size, it was designed for relaxing -- nothing so strenuous as butterfly- or backstrokes or, God forbid, cannonballs.</p>
        <p>Last summer, Cameron Diaz checked in at Quinta da Capela and no one noticed. Her boyfriend's blue-tinted fingernails caused some comment, but no more than that provoked by the hotel menagerie.</p>
        <p>Two peacocks, one in full harlequin regalia, the other an albino, swanked along the pebbled paths. In a tea-colored pond, a pair of swans glided back and forth. When you picked up speed as you walked by, they did too. When you stopped, they feathered to a halt. I thought the birds had been specially bred to race with the guests, but my wife explained that the swans kept pace with passers-by in the hope of food.</p>
        <p>White doves littered the lawn and the driveway out front. Whenever a car drove by or a stroller trudged past, the birds swirled up like dream snowflakes, rising rather than falling.</p>
        <p>In the formal garden behind the main building, skinny lizards flashed away from every footfall. Fat chameleons, trusting their camouflage, waited until the last second before waddling into the topiary hedges. But the snake stood its ground, or, to be precise, its step.</p>
        <p>Yes, as in all paradises, there was a serpent and, predictably, it appeared one Sunday morning as my wife and I were on our way to Mass. Flicking its forked tongue and darting its spade-shaped head, it blocked the staircase leading to the quinta's chapel.</p>
        <p>Marc arrived to reassure us that there were no poisonous vipers in these parts, just friendly, helpful snakes. They killed rats, he swore. One had been christened Emily. The serpent seemed to recognize the name and wilted, flopping onto its belly and disappearing into a culvert, and we climbed to the chapel of Nossa Senh-ora de Piedade.</p>
        <p>The chapel is a small unadorned cube, but its interior walls are waterfalls of blue tiles, or azulejos, chronicling the life of Christ. The congregation consisted of farmworkers in their Sunday best and owners of nearby quintas, the men in tan linen suits or navy blue blazers, the women wearing twin sets, gold bracelets and necklaces.</p>
        <p>During Communion, babies were passed from person to person as each family shuffled forward to the priest. Afterward they gathered outside and discussed the weather and crops.</p>
        <p>Now it must be acknowledged that -- jewel-like chapel, swimming swans, strutting peacocks and friendly snakes notwithstanding -- a vacation at Quinta da Capela might not be to everyone's taste. There are no television sets or radios, no game rooms or organized events. Telephone service can be erratic and e-mail, in our experience, was impossible.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the quinta has no restaurant on the premises and doesn't serve meals beyond an excellent breakfast.</p>
        <p>There's really nothing much to do there except . . . Except sit in the sun and listen to bumblebees and trilling birds. Or retreat to the rattan chairs in a gazebo and gaze out at the garden, or look up at the quotation over the door lintel: ''Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.'' Or catalog the flora -- a profusion of ferns, palms, oleanders, live oaks, citrus trees, mimosas, fuchsias, hydrangeas, geraniums, banana plants, fig trees, clumps of lavender and swagged bougainvillea vines, plots of blue agapanthus shaking in the breeze and immense century plants with lethal-looking leaves and a central stalk as surreal as a giant asparagus.</p>
        <p>It's fortunate the Quinta didn't have a restaurant. This kept us from subsiding into complete sybaritism. Obliged to make forays for food, we sometimes drove down the hill to the village of Colares or farther on to the sea for fresh fish. Occasionally we walked uphill to Sintra and, seen on foot, the road was more fascinating than frightening. Some of the cork oaks had their bark peeled off, and sheets of it lay drying like flat loaves of bread in a bakery window. Back in bosky dells thickly upholstered with moss, I recalled that E--&gt;a de Queiros, a 19th-century Portuguese novelist, described Sintra as ''a trysting place, and beneath its romantic foliage noble ladies had surrendered to the arms of poets.''</p>
        <p>Up the hill stands the ornate and ''Orientalized'' Monserrate Palace, built in the mid-1850's. Or so the guidebook said. Closed for renovation, it was draped in plastic from roofline to foundation. But we explored its garden. A vast meditation in green, this wild jungle of vegetation was the brainchild of Sir Francis Cook, a 19th-century Englishman reputed to have imported more than 2,500 species of exotic plants. There are ferns from New Zealand the size of fir trees, sequoias from California that seem as tall as Mount McKinley and a banyan tree from India whose air-roots -- resembling the arms of Shiva -- crush the ruins of a chapel.</p>
        <p>About a mile away, Seteais Palace is a meticulously tended hotel whose name, depending upon which legend one believes, means either ''seven echoes'' or ''seven sighs.'' It's a favorite venue for wedding receptions, and on summer nights its garden is given over to orchestras or ballet troupes. We had the spooky experience of watching Cuban dancers perform on a stage awhirl with fog, a special effect created by Mother Nature.</p>
        <p>Sintra itself is a hilly village of some 20,000 souls who have long made a living off day-trippers from Lisbon. In fair weather, especially during the Sunday market, it can be chockablock with people. But apart from the tourists clustered outside restaurants reading displayed menus, the town retains its character. Cats and roosters and women in black slink along the cobblestones.</p>
        <p>As a World Heritage site with strict limits on development, Sintra also retains its quirky architecture. In his novel ''The Maias,'' E--&gt;a de Queiros described its most celebrated landmark, the 14th-century National Palace, as ''massive'' and ''silent . . . without fleurons or towers, seated patriarchally among the houses of the town . . . its two colossal chimneys, disparate, summing up everything as though that residence was all a kitchen built on a scale to suit the gluttony of a king who daily devours an entire kingdom.'' Seen from the inside, the palace is dominated less by its kitchen than by a succession of splendid public spaces and diverse private rooms where the royal family could choose to reside in austerity one day and pashalike opulence the next. As to their spiritual needs, they could worship nature on enclosed patios or Christ in a tiled Mudejar chapel.</p>
        <p>On the subject of Pena Palace, the second royal residence here, E--&gt;a de Queiros remained largely silent. One can't blame him. This mythic-Gothic extravaganza could render anybody speechless. The brainstorm of King Fernando II (Ferdinand of Saxe Coburg-Gotha) and built in the mid-19th century, it erupts atop a mountain in a polychromatic volcano of architectural styles. A cousin of Mad King Ludwig, builder of his own famous fantasy castles in Bavaria, Ferdinand continued the family tradition that excess is best. In an apparent attempt to incorporate into one rambling structure parts of every famous building in Europe, the palace resembles a collusion of the Alhambra with Chartres, of Windsor Castle with Cologne Cathedral. To add Portuguese spice to the mix, Manueline motifs -- coiled rope, anchors and other allusions to the sea -- crop up everywhere.</p>
        <p>We visited Pena Palace one afternoon in a strong windstorm. Waiters at a cafe on one of the palace's terraces rushed out and took in the umbrellas, looking like crack crewmen on an ocean liner reefing sails during a hurricane. But then everything up there looked like something else. Columns resembled dessert custards, doorways yawning mouths, peaked roofs witches' caps. There were open-mouthed alligators as rain gutters, trolls squatting in conch shells and window surrounds of braided stone ropes.</p>
        <p>From a west-facing parapet that bore the brunt of the wind, we peered down at the seacoast about six miles away and counted off the beaches we had been to.</p>
        <p>There was Cascais, a tony resort with designer boutiques and fast-food outlets lining its pedestrian esplanade. A block away sailors mended nets in courtyards. When the fleet comes in, the fish market is livelier than a disco.</p>
        <p>Where the coast curved north, the landscape turned spiny and sparsely inhabited, and tall waves tilted toward shore as if in imitation of the mountains that spill into the Atlantic. Off Praia do Guincho, windsurfers slalomed through rough water. Sand seethed, piling up in tawny dunes. Each boulder-strewn cove had its own ecosystem and microclimate.</p>
        <p>In overcast spots, the weather was as chilly and gray as Brittany, but around the next bend, the sun was out and the ocean blazed in African light.</p>
        <p>Beyond our field of vision, Praia Grande, we guessed, was thronged with swimmers and surfers and hearty climbers who hiked up the cliff to see the 66 footprints left by dinosaurs. Praia da Adraga, our favorite, huddled between huge rocks sculptured into strange shapes that prompted stranger stories. A brochure from the Sintra Town Council spoke of ''Atlantean Tritons appearing on the beaches for the purpose of fecundating virgins, allaying them with their lullabies.''</p>
        <p>I never caught sight of a Triton fecundating a virgin. I did, however, experience what struck me as comparable wonders.</p>
        <p>At Praia das Macas, in the orange aspic of evening light, I saw horsemen galloping through surf like centaurs emerging from the sea. On a cliff outside Azenhas do Mar, I ordered tiger prawns at a restaurant and was confronted with two grilled, buttered and garlicked creatures the size of a wrestler's arm. To my amazement, I finished them both and ordered another.</p>
        <p>With a friend, Linda and I drove to Cabo da Roca, the westernmost tip of Continental Europe. Some tourists insist on buying an inscribed document certifying their presence at 38 degrees 47 minutes north latitude, 9 degrees 30 minutes west longitude. We luxuriated in the astonishing light. Our friend referred to it as ''magic time,'' that moment when, cameramen swear, every shot is a success, every image burnished with gold.</p>
        <p>But as we bathed in that light, I realized that the famous cliche was about to meet its demise. Neither a single photograph nor several thousand words could capture this place. We would have to come again.</p>
        <p>Sintra's Green Havens</p>
        <p>UINTA DA CAPELA, Estrada Velha de Colares (telephone: 351-21-929-0170; fax: 351-21-929-3425). In addition to seven rooms in the main house, there are three cottages with full hotel services and self-catering facilities. Each cottage has a double bedroom, a fold-out bed in the sitting room, kitchen, terrace and patio. The price for both rooms and cottages is about $150, including breakfast. The main house is closed from November to March 1, but the cottages are open year round.  QUINTA DAS SEQUOIAS, 1004 Estrada de Monserrate Apartado (351-21-924-3821; fax: 351-21-923-0342). Comparable to the Quinta da Capela, it is set among ancient redwood trees, and there is a pool. The quinta has six rooms, all with bathroom, and a double room costs about $120, including breakfast. No meals except breakfast are served. Closed in winter.  HOTEL PALCIO DE SETEAIS, 10 Rua Barbosa de Bocage (351-21-923-3200; fax: 351-21-923-4277). A landmark monument, it provides luxury accommodation, with tennis courts, a pool and riding facilities. There are 30 rooms, and a double room costs about $235. The hotel restaurant offers such local specialties as stone bass fillets Seteais style and braised veal; dinner for two, with a bottle of wine, is about $75.  LAWRENCE'S HOTEL, 38-40 Rue Consiglieri Pedroso (351-21-910-5500; fax: 351-21-910-5505). Set in the town itself, it opened around 1764, and has recently been renovated and reopened. There are 16 rooms, including 5 suites, and a double costs about $180, with breakfast. Lord Byron stayed here. If that's not inducement enough, Lawrence's has an excellent restaurant, offering such specials as fish soup, fillet of wild boar topped with camembert cheese and, for dessert, melon and strawberry soup with mint leaves. Dinner for two, with wine, costs about $80.  For simpler fare, especially seafood, I enjoyed Buzio, at 56 Avenue Eugene Levy in Praia das Macas (telephone and fax: 351-21-929-2172), where a meal for two with an excellent bottle of local wine costs about $60. For meat, it's difficult to outdo REFUGIO DA ROCA, in the village of Azoia on the road to Cabo da Roca (351-21-929-0898; fax: 351-21-929-1752). Served on espetadas, or skewers, the beef, pork, sausage (or shrimp and squid) comes freshly grilled and dripping delicious juices. The espetadas are hung from hooks over the table so that the juice drips down onto plates of French fries. A meal for two, with wine, is about $60.</p>
