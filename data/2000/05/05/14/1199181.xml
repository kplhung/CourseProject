        <p>Incubus  By Ann Arensberg. Ballantine, $14.</p>
        <p>In this postmodern Gothic novel, wilted crops, bizarre weather, monstrous births among farm animals and especially the arrival of a bodiless force that ravishes women become metaphors for the sexual and social problems of a small Maine town. ''Arensberg is particularly good at depicting the itch and ache of human relations,'' Janet Burroway wrote here in 1999.</p>
        <p>Mind of the Raven:  Investigations and Adventures With Wolf-Birds  By Bernd Heinrich. Cliff Street/HarperPerennial, $13.</p>
        <p>A biologist examines the social relationships and mischievous behavior of the common raven to determine whether these uncannily intelligent birds learn tricks by chance or consciously analyze problems. ''The mind of Bernd Heinrich is a big, antic thing, like a raven, and meant to live outdoors,'' David Quammen wrote in the Book Review in 1999. ''He has a rare ability to embed dense scientific explications within graceful, light-footed nature writing.'' According to Living on the Wind: Across the Hemisphere With Migratory Birds, by Scott Weidensaul (North Point/Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $15), an estimated five billion birds migrate throughout the Western Hemisphere every year, often in journeys of amazing length and duration. Last year one critic called this account of migratory habits ''fulfilling for birders and nonbirders alike.''</p>
        <p>Terra Infirma: A Memoir of My Mother's Life in Mine  By Rodger Kamenetz. Schocken, $11.</p>
        <p>The author's unsparing meditation on his mother, who died at 54 from cancer, examines the inspiring yet destructive force of her love, and probes the mystery of one woman's jagged, willful character and the way it imprints itself on her son. Last year in The Times, Richard Bernstein called this ''an impressively intelligent, maturely perceptive and learned'' book that is both ''strange and moving.'' The same publisher has reissued A Good Enough Daughter: A Memoir, by Alix Kates Shulman ($13), in which an independent New York writer returns to suburban Cleveland to care for her aging parents and discovers their vigorous inner lives, including her mother's impassioned pursuit of a literary career in later life. ''Her portrayal is refreshingly upbeat, infused with insight, affection and respect,'' Leslie Chess Feller wrote here in 1999. Grace, by Robert Ward (St. Martin's Griffin, $12.95), is a fictional account of the author's complex relationship with his grandmother, with whom he spent part of his childhood in postwar Baltimore, and her life as a social activist. The result is ''a book-length valentine written for and about a woman he clearly adored,'' Ruth Coughlin said here in 1998. In White Oleander, by Janet Fitch (Back Bay/Little, Brown, $13.95), a lovely but poisonous plant is a metaphor for motherhood. This novel follows the harrowing coming of age of a girl who is forced into the California foster care system after her mother, a footloose poet, is imprisoned for the murder of a lover. Fitch's ''startlingly apt language relates a story that is both intelligent and gripping,'' Gretchen Holbrook Gerzina wrote in these pages last year.</p>
        <p>Paris Trance: A Romance  By Geoff Dyer.  North Point/Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $13.</p>
        <p>Luke Barnes is a young Englishman who travels to Paris to write a novel, only to hook up with a beautiful Serbian student and another couple, and to discover how contentment can curdle into inertia and failure. ''I can't think of a recent novel that better describes the scarily charged beginning of a love affair,'' Daniel Mendelsohn wrote in these pages last year.</p>
        <p>The Lexus and the Olive Tree  By Thomas L. Friedman. Anchor, $15.</p>
        <p>A columnist for The New York Times deploys a torrent of anecdotes and vignettes to probe the causes and effects of globalization and the transforming power of technology. ''Friedman knows how to cut through the arcana of high tech and high finance with vivid images,'' Josef Joffe wrote in these pages last year.</p>
        <p>A View From the Mangrove  By Antonio Benitez-Rojo.  University of Massachusetts, $16.95.</p>
        <p>The final work of a trilogy by the expatriate Cuban author exploring the history of the Caribbean is a collection of tales of slave trading, invasions, murders and other events in which the characters exist only in extremis. ''His stories are dense with disaster and rich in description,'' Barbara Fisher wrote here in 1998.</p>
        <p>Don't Look Back: Satchel Paige in the Shadows of Baseball  By Mark Ribowsky. Da Capo, $16.</p>
        <p>According to this biography, Leroy Robert (Satchel) Paige, the most famous player in the history of the Negro leagues, was both a brilliant pitcher and a shrewd self-promoter. The author ''has done enough digging into Paige's life and career to separate the historical record from the pitcher's own gauzy, entertaining recollections,'' Warren Goldstein said here in 1994.</p>
        <p>In the Pond  By Ha Jin. Vintage International, $11.</p>
        <p>In this first novel by the winner of last year's National Book Award, a factory worker in a Chinese village unleashes satirical cartoons and clever letters of complaint in a crusade against his superiors. The result is a ''naughty, lusty, raucously entertaining'' screwball comedy, Mei Chin wrote here in 1999.</p>
