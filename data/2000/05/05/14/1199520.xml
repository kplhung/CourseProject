        <p>An article on Page 7 of the Westchester section today about Gov. George E. Pataki's decision to investigate allegations of misconduct by the Putnam County Sheriff's Department refers to a civil suit in which a jury awarded $645,000 to a man who said he was a victim of selective prosecution. Of that amount, $435,000 was to be paid by the sheriff himself, Robert Thoubboron. On Thursday, after the article had gone to press, Judge Charles L. Brieant of Federal District Court in White Plains cut the sheriff's liability to $3,000, saying the original award ''shocks the conscience of the court.''</p>
