        <p>Before the speeches and granting of degrees, the poet Nikki Giovanni stopped to chat with a visitor at the 159th commencement at Manhattanville College here.</p>
        <p>Ms. Giovanni, one of the country's major poets, founder of a publishing company that promotes the work of black women, teacher and activist, would be receiving the honorary degree of humane letters. But at this moment she was not talking about the lofty heights of academia or literature.</p>
        <p>''I bleached my hair blond a while back, because I was trying to look really healthy,'' she said running a hand through close cropped curls. She explained that she had had a lung removed, but that the malignant tumor was encapsulated and the prognosis was excellent. ''I thought the blond hair made my face look nice and tan and healthy.'' She also commented on her rhinestone lapel pin, which spells out the word ''write'' -- ''I wore it to the White House and Bill and Hillary both said, 'really cool pin.' ''</p>
        <p>This emphasis on the concrete -- on the human things that make up the bigger picture -- permeated Ms. Giovanni's keynote speech to 2,700, including 478 men and women receiving undergraduate and graduate degrees, their families and friends, and faculty and administrators. To spontaneous whoops and bursts of applause, Ms. Giovanni told an imagined anecdote of a young man who lived more than 500 years ago.</p>
        <p>''There is this young man sitting around in Genoa, and his mother looks at him and says, 'Chris, what are your plans,' and he says, 'Mom, I don't have any plans, I'm a poor boy.'</p>
        <p>''She knew if she let him stay in Genoa, he'd hang out with a bad crowd and drink, and then someone would knock on the door and say, 'Chris got me pregnant.'</p>
        <p>''So his mother said, 'You've got to go somewhere. I hear you talkin' about Ferdinand and this Isa-something, what about them? You've got to go somewhere.'</p>
        <p>''I know as a mother that she was afraid for her child,'' Ms. Giovanni continued, ''because somebody out there will let you know you are colored or not loved or fat. But we send you out 'cause you've got to go somewhere. If you stay at home, you'll die. We don't want you to die that kind of death.''</p>
        <p>Christopher Columbus, Ms. Giovanni went on, ''hung around the wharf and met the people he had to meet.'' He got his three ships, and set sail for the new world.</p>
        <p>Some of his crew wanted to stop at the Canary Islands, afraid they were going to fall off the edge of the earth. In a voice that bore no trace of lung disease, Ms. Giovanni shouted, ''Christopher said, 'I'm looking for a new world and I'm going to keep looking until I find it.' ''</p>
        <p>That new world, she added, ''will welcome everybody here under this tent today, everybody on this ship.''</p>
        <p>The cheers that greeted Ms. Giovanni's message followed other speakers as well. Richard A. Berman, Manhattanville's president, stood behind a bank of white and magenta azaleas and said, ''I'm truly moved to see 478 passionate, creative individuals from 10 states and 11 countries with the power to change a world. Hold on to that feeling, it's real, it's true, you've earned it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Berman presented an honorary doctorate of humane letters to Sister Beatrice V. Brennan, a sister of the Society of the Sacred Heart who graduated in Manhattanville's class of 1941 and now works in East Harlem acting as advocate for Hispanic families.</p>
