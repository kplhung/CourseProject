        <p>Domestic cats, those masked, murderous, infantile creatures famous for their lack of loyalty, are not often featured as heroes in stories for children. Being dispassionate observers of the human comedy, they can make good accessories to picture-book scenes, but as heroes they elicit more anxiety than trust. (Chivalrous Puss-in-Boots is an exception only because he's a fake cat. No cat would ever display the virtues of a cavalier. Puss is really more like a dog in disguise.)</p>
        <p>Two new picture books from Britain with cats as heroes do not deny the treacherous nature of felines. But they fail to create really funny stories around them.</p>
        <p>Satoshi Kitamura has been much admired for his bright, energetic illustrations for several of Hiawyn Oram's books and for his own revamping of an old tale, ''Sheep in Wolves' Clothing.'' In ''Me and My Cat?'' a boy, Nicholas, is magically put into the body of his cat, Leonardo, while Leonardo gets put into Nicholas's body. Carried away by his new cat agility, Nicholas-as-Leonardo knocks over a full wardrobe and, later on, gets chased by a dog. When Leonardo-as-Nicholas returns from school, he runs the gamut of feline behavior, from sharpening his nails on the furniture to curling up in a laundry basket.</p>
        <p>Boy-as-cat chases after cat-as-boy and the house gets torn apart. That night, the witch who first caused this chaos returns to set things straight (she erred, coming to do her magic at the wrong address), and the story ends with a twist: next day at school, Nicholas's teacher has become a cat.</p>
        <p>All this is told with the blase violence familiar from a trillion television shows. Kitamura's art resembles the animation seen on the Cartoon Network, edgy and angular, a style that becomes a barrier to the artist's intent when the plan is to depict the smooth, springy suppleness of cats. And that -- evoking memories of familiar feline postures for the sake of a laugh -- is what this book is all about. Still, many children will no doubt respond with laugh-track chuckles, especially to the sight of a boy squatting in a litter box. My test audience -- that is, my inner 6-year-old -- obviously did not.</p>
        <p>Peter Collington is best known here for his wordless picture books like ''A Small Miracle,'' an original Christmas tale that presented serious subject matter in a manner that many readers found, in the end, somehow uplifting. ''Clever Cat'' does just the opposite -- turning a potentially bouncy satire into a leaden sinker.</p>
        <p>Cruelly put off by his busy and oblivious human family, Tibs the cat decides to open his own can of food, then proceeds to eat it with a spoon. Impressed, the humans allow him all sorts of privileges: his own door key and a cash-machine card. (Talk about accelerated learning!) Taking to capitalism as he used to do to tuna, Tibs becomes a spendthrift -- frequenting restaurants and movies, going shopping, even gambling at a casino. When the humans discover his profligate ways, they take away his plastic and make him go out and get a job so he can pay them rent. Economic reality and the drudgery of the daily 9-to-5 convince Tibs that a cat's life -- seen here as basically taking naps -- is preferable to human work, and he gratefully hastens back to it.</p>
        <p>This might sound audacious and daringly dark for a children's book, but in fact it only shows how a venturesome concept can be crushed by a sincerely miserable outlook. It comes off as a wholehearted recommendation for living on the dole.</p>
        <p>Collington's human and feline characters here are equally unappealing. Better Puss-in-Boots, a fake cat with some confidence and buoyancy, than this catatonic kitty in cement shoes.</p>
