        <p>It's beginning to smell a lot like 1994. That would be the aroma coming from the American League West.</p>
        <p>When the 1994 season ended prematurely, courtesy of a labor dispute between the players and the owners, no A.L. West team had a winning record. None had even a .500 record. The Texas Rangers were in first place, and their record (52-62) was far from .500.</p>
        <p>Check the division's developments in the early weeks of the season, heading into yesterday's games:</p>
        <p>The Rangers (16-19) had their best winning percentage after they won the first two games of the season. The last time they had a .500 record was at 5-5.</p>
        <p>When the Oakland Athletics (19-17) sneaked one victory over .500 at 18-17 on Thursday night, it was the first time since they had a 2-1 record that they had climbed above .500.</p>
        <p>The best the Anaheim Angels (18-19) had done was get two victories above .500. They were one under .500 before yesterday's game.</p>
        <p>Since the Seattle Mariners (17-16) had a 12-7 record, they had won 5 games and lost 9.</p>
        <p>The teams, however, aren't ready to play down to their past. ''I don't think it's going to reach that,'' Pat Gillick, the Mariners' general manager, said.</p>
        <p>Doug Melvin, the Rangers' general manager, said, ''I think somebody will be at .500 to win the division.''</p>
        <p>Each team has had its problems. The Mariners put together what promised to be the best starting pitching rotation in their history, but the leaders of that rotation, Jamie Moyer and Freddy Garcia, are on the disabled list, having started a combined seven games. The Mariners think Moyer, recovering from a strain behind his left shoulder, can return before June 1. Garcia, who inexplicably fractured a leg, isn't expected back until the latter part of June.</p>
        <p>''I hate to say it,'' Gillick said, ''but it will come down to who can stay injury-free. There have been a lot of injuries in this division already. If you lose a significant contributor, it puts a crimp in everything.''</p>
        <p>The Angels began the season with Tim Belcher, one of their veteran starting pitchers, on the disabled list. He has since been joined by two other starters, Ken Hill and Jason Dickson, as well as shortstop Gary DiSarcina, who had hit .395 in 12 games.</p>
        <p>Rusty Greer and Gabe Kapler, two-thirds of the Texas outfield, are on the disabled list, as is Frank Catalanotto, a .500-hitting platooned second baseman. The Rangers also learned last week that Justin Thompson, the primary pitcher they received in the Juan Gonzalez trade, needs rotator-cuff surgery and won't pitch at all this season.</p>
        <p>Oakland's offensive catalyst, second baseman Randy Velarde, only recently came off the disabled list, where he had been since the start of the season. Kevin Appier, one of their veteran starting pitchers, came off the list yesterday, while John Jaha, one of their productive hitters, remains on it.</p>
        <p>But the Athletics have no shortage of productive hitters. The division, in fact, boasts an offensive orientation.</p>
        <p>The Rangers lead the league in hitting, while the Athletics lead in runs scored despite having one of the lowest batting averages and the most strikeouts, and they are second in home runs.</p>
        <p>The Athletics' Jason Giambi entered the weekend No. 1 in the league in home runs (15) and runs batted in (42) and second in slugging percentage (.735), Darin Erstad of Anaheim had the highest batting average (.388), the highest home average (.461) and the most hits (59), Alex Rodriguez of Seattle was first in runs scored (36), on-base percentage (.483), road batting average (.435) and walks (29), David Segui of Texas was second in batting average (.378) and Ivan Rodriguez of Texas was second in total bases (92).</p>
        <p>Pitching, then, must be a problem.</p>
        <p>Melvin readily acknowledged that the Rangers' relief corps has undermined the team's efforts to attain a winning record. John Wetteland squandered a couple of ninth-inning leads over Cleveland and the Yankees, and Jeff Zimmerman, who last year was virtually unhittable, gave up game-losing home runs to Clay Bellinger of the Yankees and Greg Vaughn of Tampa Bay.</p>
        <p>Just as damaging, some of the relievers' earned run averages look as if they were attacked by a severe siege of inflation: Mike Munoz 13.50, Matt Perisho 10.50, Tim Crabtree 9.18. The Angels have some of those, too: Mark Petkovsek 8.84 and Shigetoshi Hasegawa 6.98.</p>
        <p>''Our starting pitching, for the most part, has been good,'' Bill Stoneman, the Angels' general manager, said. ''Our relief pitching started off poorly, but it looks like it's coming along.''</p>
        <p>Stoneman said he believed the Angels were better than a .500 team. ''We haven't been able to separate ourselves from the .500 mark,'' he added, ''but I see ourselves doing it.''</p>
        <p>With the departure of Ken Griffey Jr., the Mariners are not the same offensively explosive team they have been in the past. ''We don't bludgeon anybody,'' Gillick said. ''Our offense is sporadic. Our game is get a well-pitched game and good defense and hope we score enough runs.''</p>
        <p>Gillick said he didn't think there was any real difference between his division and the Central. Melvin offered a similar view, noting that the West was ''a good division from the standpoint of being competitive.''</p>
        <p>''Beyond the Yankees,'' he added, ''everybody has problems. If you take away what the Yankees have done, I'm not sure there are any other great teams. That's the way it is in our league right now. It looks like there's parity.''</p>
        <p>With parity comes mediocrity. Mediocrity breeds .500 teams, or worse.</p>
        <p>A Rare Pair of 1-0 Shutouts</p>
        <p>If, as some baseball people believe, the ball has been altered to allow batters to hit more home runs, which balls must Steve Trachsel have used in his last two starts for Tampa Bay? An 18-game loser last year who did not win two successive starts until September, Trachsel has pitched in two consecutive 1-0 shutouts.</p>
        <p>He did not complete the second one, against the Yankees and Orlando Hernandez on Thursday night, but his seven-inning, three-hit performance was impressive nonetheless, especially following his complete-game three-hit shutout against Boston last Saturday in a matchup with Pedro Martinez.</p>
        <p>The only 1999 performance that came close to Trachsel's achievement was a pair of 1-0 complete-game shutouts Jose Jimenez pitched for St. Louis against Arizona, whose pitcher in both games was one Randy Johnson. Just to make the feat more spectacular, Jimenez pitched a no-hitter in the first shutout and allowed only two hits in the second. The only problem was Jimenez made a start between those 1-0 shutouts, losing to Houston, 11-3.</p>
        <p>According to research by Elias Sports Bureau, the last pitcher to win two consecutive starts by 1-0 scores was Zane Smith of Pittsburgh in 1992. Smith pitched a complete-game five-hitter against St. Louis, then permitted five hits in eight and a third innings against Houston. Stan Belinda got the last two outs.</p>
        <p>Home runs may be up from last season, but so are 1-0 games. Eight such games have been played this season compared with seven in the corresponding period last year. The Devil Rays have won three of them. The Red Sox, the Angels and the Dodgers have each lost two.</p>
        <p>Left-Handers Can't Hit Johnson</p>
        <p>In Randy Johnson's first seven starts for Arizona this season, the relatively few left-handed batters who faced him did not fare well. But then left-handers seldom do. Rafael Palmeiro, for example, made no pretense about not wanting to play when Johnson pitched against his team. Palmeiro has batted against the left-hander 21 times and has only one hit to show for his futile efforts.</p>
        <p>This season Todd Helton of Colorado and Mark Grace of the Chicago Cubs had the only two left-handed hits against Johnson in left-handers' 25 times at bat. Then last Wednesday night Johnson pitched against Los Angeles, and the Dodgers put only one left-handed hitter in their lineup. That hitter, Shawn Green, who had not had a hit in five American League at-bats against Johnson, stroked three singles in four tries.</p>
        <p>''You just don't see a left-hander stay in there against Randy the way Green did,'' said Sandy Johnson, the Diamondbacks' assistant general manager.</p>
        <p>Hernandez Homer Ratio Up</p>
        <p>Hideki Irabu was not the most popular pitcher who ever played for the Yankees. One element of his game that aroused criticism was his penchant for giving up home runs. Last season he allowed an average of one home run for 6.5 innings. The popular Orlando Hernandez, meanwhile, permitted one in nine innings.</p>
        <p>Pitching for Montreal this season, Irabu has basically maintained his 1999 pace, giving up one home run every 7 innings (5 in 35 1/3 innings). But look who's giving up more? Hernandez has thrown 11 home run pitches in 56 2/3 innings, or one every 5 innings. He is tied for second in the American League for most home runs allowed, one behind Mike Mussina of Baltimore.</p>
        <p>Kim's Glove Full of Strikeouts</p>
        <p>Byung Hyun Kim, a Diamondbacks relief pitcher from Kwayngsan-ku Songjung-dong, South Korea, committed a no-no in a game against the Dodgers last week. As a bunt by Alex Cora rolled past him, Kim flung his glove at the ball to try to stop it.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for Kim, his aim was not good and the glove missed the ball. Had he made contact, Cora would have wound up at third base with one out in the 10th inning of a tied score. The rules award three bases to a batter if a fielder throws his glove at a ball and hits it.</p>
        <p>''Ah yes, three bases, no more,'' Kim said the next day when he was asked about the play.</p>
        <p>The 21-year-old right-hander might not have known about the glove-throwing rule, but ask him about strikeouts and he could already write his own book. In six appearances from April 27 through last Wednesday, Kim pitched a total of six innings and struck out batters for 17 of the 18 outs.</p>
        <p>His only miss? A tapper back to the mound by Todd Hundley of Los Angeles in the fifth off those six games. Kim pitched to two San Diego batters Friday night and both grounded out.</p>
        <p>Throwing a fastball in the low 90's and an assortment of sliders, Kim dazzled batters for Philadelphia, Milwaukee, San Diego and Los Angeles. He gave up four hits, and the lone run he allowed cost the Diamondbacks the first of those games, but his string of strikeouts represents one of the most impressive performances of the season. In 13 games over all, he has struck out 28 in 16 2/3 innings and has a 1.62 earned run average.</p>
        <p>What happened after the glove-tossing display? He had struck out Adrian Beltre before the bunt, and afterward he struck out Dave Hansen and Todd Hollandsworth.</p>
