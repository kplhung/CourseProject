        <p>FROM the opening performance next Sunday until Oct. 8, half a million playgoers will make their way to Oberammergau, Germany, to witness a dramatic re-enactment of the crucifixion and resurrection of Jesus. The villagers of Oberammergau, in the foothills of the Bavarian Alps, have been staging their six-hour Passion play roughly once a decade since 1634. It is a Roman Catholic play about Jews, performed in German before a largely Protestant audience, most of whom will be American or British. The newly refurbished Passion playhouse holds 4,700 people, and 112 performances have been scheduled. The play (with the exception of some returns from travel agents) is sold out.</p>
        <p>The Oberammergau Passion Play is as controversial as it is popular. For the last four decades, the villagers have been divided over questions ranging from ''how Jewish was Jesus and who killed him?'' to ''should Protestants and married women be allowed to act in the play?''</p>
        <p>More recently, winds of reform have swept through Oberammergau, and this millennial production of the Passion play will be markedly different from those staged in previous decades. For the first time, Jesus will be referred to as rabbi, not Christ. The high priests who oppose him will no longer wear horned hats. Pilate's famous words ''ecce homo'' (''behold the man,'' when he presented Jesus to the populace before the crucifixion) are gone: part of an effort to shift responsibility for the death of Jesus to the Romans. And not only will Protestants and married women have roles, but so will a longtime Muslim resident of the town.</p>
        <p>Nearly half of Oberammergau's 5,300 inhabitants will take part in the production. Eligibility is limited to those born in Oberammergau, those who have lived there for 20 years or those who marry villagers (which cuts the probationary period in half). The desire to be part of the play is so strong that mortality rates dip in the years immediately preceding and rise in those following the play season: the aged and the infirm tend to hold on for one more chance to be involved.</p>
        <p>Almost every Oberammergauer first acts in the play as a child. At a ceremony in September, in which the villagers reaffirmed their ancestral vow to stage the play, veteran Passion players were honored for a lifetime of participation that for some stretched back to 1910. As one former director put it: ''The play is a part of us. It controls the rhythms of our life, like it or not.''</p>
        <p>Fourteen months ago, the villagers began to let their hair -- and the men their beards -- grow long, the better to resemble the first-century Jews they portray; no makeup, wigs or artificial lighting are used. The actors are all amateurs and rehearse in the evenings after a day at work. The rehearsal period lasts for eight months, just enough time for the directors to transform 2,000 woodcarvers, schoolchildren, clerks, farmers, housewives and even the mayor into Passion players.</p>
        <p>Tradition holds that the play had its origins in a vow taken in 1633, during the Thirty Years' War, when plague ravaged the countryside. Desperate village leaders made a vow: if those still alive were spared, the townspeople would perform a Passion play in perpetuity. According to tradition, not another soul in Oberammergau perished from the plague. While no contemporary evidence survives to confirm the story, many in Oberammergau consider their performance in the play the fulfillment of the vow.</p>
        <p>It was not until the mid-19th century that the devout and the curious began making the pilgrimage to Oberammergau in large numbers. In 1830, roughly 13,000 spectators came to see the play. By 1860, after the ''discovery'' of Oberammergau, that number had grown to 100,000. Once the railway from Munich finally reached Oberammergau in 1900 -- the town is about 60 miles southwest of the city -- the number of playgoers doubled, then doubled again. Many have come to consider Oberammergau a Christian Shangri-La, an isolated village whose simple piety was not yet corrupted by the materialism that increasingly defined life in the West.</p>
        <p>In keeping with that image, the villagers have repeatedly rejected lucrative offers to take their play abroad or to allow it to be filmed, arguing that it would violate the spirit of their vow -- and, skeptics note, cut down on the profits made from housing and feeding visitors and selling them locally produced woodcarvings. Many villagers count on earning money from the play as performers and hosts. Most foreign visitors will have purchased a package that includes both a ticket ($50 to $75) and overnight room and board in an Oberammergau home or small hotel. There is even an Oberammergau Web site: passionsspiele2000.de.</p>
        <p>Since Oberammergau started charging admission to the play 200 years ago, the villagers have struggled to reconcile the demands of religious expression with financial gain. At an early rehearsal in September, nervous laughter broke out when Jesus (after destroying the tables of the merchants in the temple) says his first words in the play: ''What do I see here? Is this God's house or a marketplace?'' The parallels between ancient Jerusalem and modern Oberammergau were not lost on those in the room.</p>
        <p>There are other sensitive issues as well. Bitterness lingers over a failed attempt in the 1970's to replace the current script (which dates from 1860) with a more spectacular and poetic one last used in 1760. The villagers have also been divided over who should appear in their play and in what capacity. Until this year, only Catholics were assigned major roles. After court battles inaugurated a decade ago by feminists in the village, women who are married, divorced or over 35 -- a group  traditionally excluded from participation -- will take part in the play.</p>
        <p>In a village that is celebrated for its piety but that in the last 20 years has witnessed a drop in churchgoing, especially among the young, the very purpose of the Passion play has been called into question. Should it be seen primarily as a fulfillment of a religious vow and a way of strengthening the faith of actors and spectators alike? Or is it an extraordinary act of communal theater that ensures the economic well-being of those who play host to hundreds of thousands of visitors?</p>
        <p>When the villagers had to elect a new director four years ago, they were essentially choosing between those alternatives. Dr. Rudolf Zwink, a dentist by profession and a popular figure who had played Jesus in the 1980 production and in the special 350th-year performances in 1984, was the traditionalists' candidate. He was opposed by Christian Stuckl, a native son in his late 30's who was already a professional director with experience at Munich's prestigious Kammerspiele theater and an international reputation. Mr. Stuckl wanted to reinvigorate a play that, from an artistic standpoint, had begun to lose its vitality.</p>
        <p>By a narrow margin, the villagers turned their play over to Mr. Stuckl. But as a counterweight, they also invited the Catholic Church to have a voice in decisions about the text, the staging and the casting of major roles. When Cardinal Friedrich Wetter of Munich came to Oberammergau in July and formally received the official script, he made clear to Mr. Stuckl his views on the special nature of Passion playing: ''The person imitating Jesus doesn't act the part, he has to be Jesus. To act it is impossible.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stuckl replied: ''I am a director of theater in Munich and Brussels. And what I do is theater.'' The deeper conflict over the nature of Passion playing remains unresolved.</p>
        <p>For more than a century, meanwhile, outsiders have condemned the play as anti-Semitic. But the criticisms have intensified since the 1960's. The script's depiction of Jews as hateful and vengeful Christ-killers had been given new emphasis when 19th-century revisers eliminated Lucifer and a host of devils who had previously been Jesus' main adversaries. As a play that traces its roots to medieval morality drama evolved into a more naturalistic revenge play, the motive and role of the Jewish leaders in seeking Jesus' death gradually expanded. One of the most electrifying moments in productions since 1860 has been the crowd scene in which, following the Gospel of Matthew, several hundred frenzied Jews demand of Pilate that Barabbas be set free and Jesus put to death, crying out what has come to be called the ''blood curse'': ''His blood be upon us and upon our children!''</p>
        <p>It has not helped defenders of tradition that Hitler, who attended the 1930 version as well as the 1934 tricentennial production (where he was warmly received by a cast that included a high percentage of Nazis), declared: ''It is vital that the Passion play be continued at Oberammergau; for never has the menace of Jewry been so convincingly portrayed as in this presentation of what happened in the times of the Romans. There, one sees in Pontius Pilate a Roman racially and intellectually so superior that he stands out like a firm, clean rock in the middle of the whole muck and mire of Jewry.''</p>
        <p>Protests against the play's representation of Jews gained momentum after 1965, following the Second Vatican Council's declaration that Jews should no longer be held collectively and perpetually responsible for the death of Jesus. Suddenly, the village that a few years earlier had been granted a canonical mission by the church was accused of anti-Semitism by both Jewish and Catholic critics. The confused villagers deeply resented these accusations and resisted outside calls for change.</p>
        <p>In 1966, Phil Baum, an executive at the American Jewish Congress, lined up a group of intellectuals to protest the play, including Arthur Miller, Lionel Trilling, Stanley Kunitz, Leonard Bernstein, Irving Howe, Alfred Kazin, Elie Wiesel, George Steiner, Gunter Grass, Heinrich Boll and Paul Celan. While not effective enough to hurt financially, the ensuing boycott of the 1970 production stung, and the villagers of Oberammergau began to take outside criticism seriously. This didn't mean that change was readily forthcoming.</p>
        <p>Leading Jewish critics -- such as Rabbi James Rudin of the American Jewish Committee and Rabbi Leon Klenicki of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith -- working alongside prominent Catholic scholars have for the last two decades negotiated with the villagers over such issues as the costuming of the Jewish leaders, the Jewishness of Jesus, the role of the Romans in putting Jesus to death and the use of Hebrew scripture to foreshadow events in the life of Jesus. No issue has been more divisive than the retention of the ''blood curse'' from the Gospel of Matthew, which the villagers claim has scriptural authority and critics argue has fomented hatred of Jews.</p>
        <p>Otto Huber, a schoolteacher who is the script director and has represented the village in its dialogue with Jewish organizations, has worked to address these concerns. This year, for the first time since 1750, the ''blood curse'' will not be heard. The Jewishness of Jesus and his disciples will be strongly emphasized: they now wear skullcaps and prayer shawls; Jesus even offers a blessing in Hebrew. Mr. Stuckl and Mr. Huber are aware that some of these changes are anachronistic, but they serve to remind audiences that Jesus was Jewish.</p>
        <p>THE interfaith distance traveled between the 1990 and 2000 productions can best be measured by the prefaces to the respective printed texts. Ten years ago, the preface contained a spirited defense of the inclusion of the ''blood curse.'' This year, it makes clear that ''the Passion play is in no way meant to assign collective guilt,'' and acknowledges that ''this Passion play, too, contributed in various ways to preparing the soil which eventually yielded the terrible harvest of the extermination of the Jews.''</p>
        <p>Rabbi Rudin and Rabbi Klenicki, who will travel to Oberammergau to see the play, are reserving judgment. Rabbi Klenicki is not optimistic. ''Despite the many changes in the script,'' he said, ''I fear that it will still be a source of anti-Judaism.''</p>
        <p>Rabbi Rudin, though pleased by the revisions, also remains skeptical: ''I'm not a playwright, but I think it's possible to tell the Passion story in a way that is spiritually satisfying and totally free of anti-Jewish images and teachings. Despite positive changes, they are still dealing with a flawed script.''</p>
        <p>Because the text has now been so extensively revised, the traditional score, first composed in 1811 by Rochus Dedler, has had to be revised as well. Dedler's music is sacrosanct in the village, and the unenviable task of providing additions to it has fallen to Markus Zwink, the Passion play conductor. Mr. Huber, the script director, who supplied Mr. Zwink with new lyrics, said he had been approached after rehearsals by singers who spoke of ''how consoling they find Zwink's music.'' In Oberammergau this is very high praise.</p>
        <p>A core of young village actors whom Mr. Stuckl has been working with since the late 1980's have filled many of the leading roles in this year's production, including that of Jesus (shared by Martin Norz and Anton Burkhart) and most of the apostles. The Jewish money-changers and high priests arrayed against them will be played by veteran actors, including many in the conservative opposition. The conflict in the Passion play between the Jewish high priests and the followers of Jesus will thus be mirrored in the intergenerational tensions within the cast.</p>
        <p>From 1922 until 1990, the same set designs, originally introduced by the director Johann Lang, were mandated. Here, especially, the theological alterations have forced change, and many of the old costumes and props, some in use for centuries, have been retired. The stage designer, Stefan Hageneier, has been given a relatively free hand, and the result is not unlike seeing an Old Master painting restored to its original brilliant colors. Like Mr. Stuckl, the 27-year-old Mr. Hageneier has already developed an international reputation, working with artists like the set and costume designer Jurgen Rose and the avant-garde stage director and designer Robert Wilson, but chose to turn down other professional opportunities to devote himself to Oberammergau's play, explaining, ''When you are born in the village, it is in your blood.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Stuckl, Mr. Huber and Mr. Hageneier were discussing candidates to design a work of art to complement the Passion play, the name of Mr. Wilson, who frequently works in Germany, came up. With the approval of the village council, the American-born designer was invited to produce a large-scale Stations of the Cross in a field adjoining the playhouse. The council members, who were unfamiliar with Mr. Wilson's style, balked when they saw his designs and voted to rescind the invitation. After further debate, the commission went forward by a single vote; Oberammergau was not eager to get into a confrontation with the art world.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson's ''14 Stations: A Light and Sound Installation,'' which covers an area half the size of a football field, will run concurrently with the Passion play. The design is cathedral-like, with 12 temporary outdoor buildings, or chapels (six on each side), forming a nave and framed by the portal and apse of the first and last structures. Mr. Wilson, who acknowledged that ''it is the first time I have created an installation or artwork related to a devotional subject,'' said he had ''approached it in the same way in which I write or direct a theatrical play or an opera.'' Village leaders remain anxious that the work of an artist better known for ''Einstein on the Beach'' than for religious art will alienate visitors who bring to Oberammergau traditional expectations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilson's ''14 Stations'' and the Passion play itself raise age-old questions in Oberammergau: should art cater to the expectations of audiences or challenge them? Can tradition and innovation be reconciled? Or, for that matter, profit and piety?</p>
