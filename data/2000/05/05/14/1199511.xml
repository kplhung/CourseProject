        <p>Earnings season is winding down, so who among Wall Street's thousands of analysts got their forecasts right?</p>
        <p>BulldogResearch.com, a Web site that started this month, keeps track of such matters, naming the three top analysts for each company based on the accuracy of quarterly earnings forecasts. Among other things, the site also rates analysts on the performance of their stock picks.</p>
        <p>The goal, according to Michael Thompson, co-president of Bulldog, is objective, analytical data to identify the brokerage firms' best. ''The industry relies on once-a-year surveys, '' he noted, referring to the analyst rankings published by The Wall Street Journal and Institutional Investor magazine.</p>
        <p>Brokerage firms like Goldman, Sachs, Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette and Bear, Stearns have already signed on to the service, authorizing disclosure of their own analysts' names and track records. Others, including Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and First Boston, are not doing so, at least not yet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson said he expected the holdouts to sign on within a year. ''We're establishing a new benchmark here,'' he said. ''It's going to take awhile.''</p>
