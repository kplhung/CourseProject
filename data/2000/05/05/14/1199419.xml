        <p>Residents near the Manhattan Bridge have grown accustomed to the rumbling of passing subways and cars, but they say that recent construction noises are intolerable.</p>
        <p>''I have never heard such an intense noise in all my time in New York,'' said Victor Papa, president of the Two Bridges Neighborhood Council.</p>
        <p>''It's a loud hum that you become numb to,'' Mr. Papa said. ''Then you become conscious of it and realize you can't get any relief.''</p>
        <p>The construction is part of a $500 million rehabilitation program begun in 1985 to repair and stiffen the 91-year-old suspension bridge, which can twist as much as eight feet when trains pass on the outer tracks. In addition to replacing truss bearings and subway stringers, workers recently began sandblasting the structure to prepare surfaces for a fresh coat of paint.</p>
        <p>The sandblasting is ''as loud as if you are underneath a helicopter,'' Marion Fox said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fox is the chairwoman of the public safety committee for Community Board 3 and is a resident of Knickerbocker Village, a  complex of apartments a block from the bridge.</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure if they are moving toward me,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The city's answer is that noise is an unfortunate but inevitable part of repair work.</p>
        <p>''All construction involve some level of noise,'' said Henry Perahia, the Department of Transportation's chief bridge officer. ''We try to limit the work to hours of the day when it disturbs fewer people. But there is a conflict.''</p>
        <p>Sandblasting and other work begin at 7 a.m. and end at 5:30 p.m. ''We start the compressors a little earlier,'' Mr. Perahia said, so that the equipment is ready when crews arrive.</p>
        <p>But some neighbors say work is beginning too early.</p>
        <p>''Not everyone wakes up at that time,'' said Wai Gun Eng, a 30-year resident of Madison Street, a half block from the bridge. ''A lot of people work at night.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Eng said the noises became worse in March, when a nighttime hum began disrupting her sleep.</p>
        <p>''It is like someone is vacuuming in my apartment the whole night long,'' she said. ''I cannot concentrate at work.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Eng has been forced to take medication to help her sleep, she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Perahia said that all equipment was turned off at 5:30 p.m.</p>
        <p>''I don't doubt for one minute that they think the noise is coming from the bridge, but that is not a part of our normal operation,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''It would be like keeping your car running all night.''</p>
