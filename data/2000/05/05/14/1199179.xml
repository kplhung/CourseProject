        <p>Dear Will</p>
        <p>By Karl Ackerman.</p>
        <p>Scribner, $24.</p>
        <p>Will Gerard is pretty much on top of the world. At 41, he's a hot literary agent who has just been profiled in The Washington Post. He's single and handsome and, as ''Dear Will'' opens, he's just about to meet Annie Leonard, a successful Washington attorney. They meet cute, and quicker than you can turn the page they've tumbled into bed. But there's a problem. Annie, who's just escaped a loveless marriage, is pushing 40 and her biological clock is ticking. But does Will want to have a child? Is he ready for the responsibility? Will he ever be? And there's another twist: Will might already be the father of a 20-year-old woman who writes to him about a possible book project concerning her search for her birth mother and father. If you think Ackerman's second novel (his first was ''The Patron Saint of Unmarried Women'') sounds like the basis for a soap opera, you wouldn't be far from wrong. The plot is not only predictable but frustratingly contrived. The characters are types rather than flesh and blood, and after a while Will's annoying navel contemplation and inaction -- he makes Hamlet seem like Harrison Ford -- set your teeth on edge. Although Ackerman draws an accurate picture of today's publishing world, this is hardly enough to justify spending so much time with people who are so achingly self-involved.</p>
