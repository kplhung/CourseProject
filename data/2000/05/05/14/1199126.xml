        <p>We're sitting at the surf at Bondi Beach as translucent blue waves fringed with sparkling white foam roll majestically into the fine yellow sand. Around us, Sydney's young and not-so-young are eating hearty helpings of Saturday brunch: mounds of eggs, tomatoes, bacon and sausage on large white plates, lashings of mangoes, strawberries and watermelon piled on others. All around, frosted tumblers of pink and yellow juices, some spiked with vodka, decorate the tables. The latest model, stainless-steel-trimmed, mobile phones glint in the morning sun, their skimpily clad owners debating whether to bid on this mansion or that as they review the weekly real estate ads in the morning paper.</p>
        <p>This is Hugo's, a trendy new restaurant-cum-hangout, a sleek, white-walled open-air room perched on the sidewalk above Sydney's most famous stretch of beach, a place where Sydney's own Nicole Kidman drops in when she returns home. Up and down the waterfront, there are more cafes and restaurants, their patrons also swathed in sunglasses against the brilliant southern glare and similarly attired, tanned midriffs revealing figures still fit from a summer of swimming and surfing.</p>
        <p>In many ways, Hugo's sums up Sydney as it prepares for its biggest bash ever, the 2000 Olympic Games taking place here from Sept. 15 to Oct. 1. Brash, confident, moneyed (at least compared to the rest of Australia), Sydney is, as a friend says, a ''tart of a town,'' always ready to have a good time. Here in Bondi, the biggest argument is over a temporary Olympics beach volleyball stadium that is to be erected on the sacred sand, blocking unfettered use of the beach from May to October. Of course, the stadium for 10,000 spectators will go ahead. In the end, no one much minds, as long as it doesn't curb waterfront property values, which, along with the latest fashions in food, is what Sydneysiders most obsess about.</p>
        <p>Nearly a century ago, H. M. Vaughan, an English visitor to Sydney -- a city that had just thrown off its British colonial vestiges -- wrote: ''I have an impression of perpetual fine weather, of radiant days on the harbor, red roofs on the foreshores, white sails on the water, ferries at their peak making alone an aquatic carnival better than Lucerne or Venice could offer.''</p>
        <p>The description still stands. In a blissful mode of transit that transforms going to work into a scenic tour, ferries speed across the harbor, taking men in suits and students in uniforms to their offices and schools. The weather is balmy year round: in the midyear winter the sun shines off the harbor water in a perpetual sheen. But now Sydney is a sophisticated Pacific hub of four million people, no longer a convict-built, rough-and-tumble town of low-slung buildings, boisterous drinking and gambling and unheeded official corruption.</p>
        <p>The once minimal skyline has given way to a contemporary urban profile, with the white-tiled sails of the Opera House announcing that this is a city that from time to time tries to take its architecture seriously.</p>
        <p>The drinking, though, has remained a constant. Boozy lunches usually end before 4 p.m., but a bottle of crisp, chilled white wine over a platter of oysters remains common midday fare. While Australian wine is as much of a success at home as abroad, beer remains an essential basic. And people here are among the biggest gamblers in the world: it is estimated that Sydney adults lose an average of $500 a year gambling. You can bet on almost anything: the horses, lotteries, slot machines (known as poker machines or ''pokies''), even sailboats on the harbor.</p>
        <p>In short, Sydney is an unabashed, pleasure-seeking city where the locals insist they work hard but in fact place as much importance on the sweep of their water view -- straight over the harbor being much preferable to a river outlook -- and the quality of champagne served at Sunday lunch. In his play ''Emerald City,'' the Australian playwright David Williamson has one of his main characters thunder: ''No one in Sydney ever wastes time debating the meaning of life -- it's getting yourself a water frontage. People devote a lifetime to the quest.''</p>
        <p>To find this brittle soul of Sydney, one must start at the water's edge, at Circular Quay, the slightly raffish downtown gateway to the harbor, where the Opera House sits astride the eastern finger of land, its luminous roof reflecting the pearly pink dawns and the soft violet sunsets.</p>
        <p>Conceived by a Danish architect, Joern Utzon, the Opera House has been a symbol of controversy and excellence ever since the design won an international competition in 1957. The soaring sails and unconventional engineering of Mr. Utzon's plan attracted the attention of Eero Saarinen, the Finnish-American architect, one of four judges for the final choice who plucked the Dane's work from an undistinguished group of entries. The Opera House opened in 1973, but only after Mr. Utzon was fired by a cranky government.</p>
        <p>The best way to appreciate the Opera House is to attend a performance: at intermission, there is nothing quite as magical as wandering to the front deck of the building, a glass of wine in hand and a breeze in the air, to admire a dark Sydney night, the glittering reflections in the water and the diamante lights of the passing ferries. Short of an evening at the Opera House, a daytime walk around it is perfectly acceptable, particularly since this house of culture is going to be, in inimitable Australian fashion, transformed momentarily into a house of sport for the Olympics -- competitors in the triathlon will splash into the harbor from the eastern promenade of the Opera House for a one-mile swim for the opening event of the games.</p>
        <p>As in many cities that have gone through intense preparations for the Olympics, a certain blase attitude has developed among Sydneysiders as the opening draws closer. There has been disappointment about the relatively small number of tickets available to ordinary people, compared to large allotments set aside for corporate buyers and sports officials. But there is little doubt that the city will benefit enormously from physical improvements, including a new thruway from the city to the recently extended airport and the renovation of city wharves.</p>
        <p>The Olympic site at Homebush is away from the city center; getting there will be a challenge. But once there, visitors will be dazzled by the main stadium and especially the Aquatic Center. Already, swimmers are raving about the speed of the pool and the spacious surrounds.</p>
        <p>From the opera house, it is a logical walk to the adjacent Royal Botanic Gardens, an oasis of green lawns, spiky palms and other subtropical vegetation, all juxtaposed among plantings designed in the Victorian era. The 74-acre Gardens border the harbor, and the perfumes of honeysuckle, lavender and magnolia mixed with the salty sea air give it an intoxicating headiness. A recent addition to the Gardens is the Tropical Center, housed in a glass pyramid and filled with lush plants and trees, including Asian orchids, from warm lowland rain forests and high-altitude tropics.</p>
        <p>On their rim, the Gardens are framed by some of Sydney's postcolonial architecture, most of it handsome sandstone buildings saved from the wrecker's ball during the 1960's, when the city's developers discovered the financial -- though unaesthetic -- benefits of cement and concrete towers. Sydney rests on a huge sandstone slab that rises at the harbor cliffs along the Pacific Ocean and then extends scores of miles into the hinterland. The light golden sandstone, quarried for many of the early buildings, remains a prized though expensive building material that lends many city streets a rich, soft glow.</p>
        <p>One of the best examples of sandstone architecture is the Art Gallery of New South Wales at the eastern edge of the Gardens. Housing a collection of Australian art of all eras, it is especially well endowed with 19th-century and post-World War II works. At the other side of the Gardens, is the State Library of New South Wales, which, like the Art Gallery, boasts a columned portico, typical of the formal Edwardian period when the library was built. It holds an unparalleled collection of Australian documents and manuscripts, with rotating exhibits chosen from the latest acquisitons. The Picture Gallery on the first floor has an interesting display of colonial art, including oil portraits of the men and women of the early settlement.</p>
        <p>An easy walk down Bridge Street and through the new towers of Chifley Plaza leads to the Rocks, a labyrinth of narrow lanes and streets that served as the first wharves and warehouses of the early colony. Always the tough belly of Sydney, it was a place of bordellos, saloons and boarding houses, where the first buildings were of sawed cabbage palm trunks, wattle timber and mud and clay. Later, these gave way to simple sandstone structures, many of which have been preserved in the aggressive sprucing up of the Rocks in the last 20 years. Now the streets have a strong whiff of tourist trap, filled with boutiques flaunting Australiana -- Crocodile Dundee hats and raincoats, vibrant posters and paintings of harbor and beach by the artist Ken Done and contemporary pottery and jewelry.</p>
        <p>A handful of authentic Australian pubs are clustered at the Rocks, some providing a casual lunch along with a schooner (large glass) or a middy (smaller glass) of beer. Pubs in Sydney are called hotels -- and indeed, most are two-story structures with some rooms for simple, if noisy, accommodation upstairs. The Australian Hotel at 100 Cumberland Street and the Mercantile Hotel at 25 George Street at the Rocks are fairly typical: walls of tiles on the exterior giving way to indoor counters where customers prop themselves up on stools. The Sydney pub remains the great equalizer and at the Mercantile, men in shorts and work boots clutch their beers alongside advertising executives from Saatchi &amp; Saatchi headquarters across the street. Slot machines line one wall, their purple and green neon lights beckoning all comers and the stale reek of beer permeates the gloomy interior.</p>
        <p>To eat in downtown Sydney, one is presented with an astonishing array of choices, befitting a city that seems to have been taken over by the ''foodies.'' (Many words in Australia become diminutives, usually indicating affection. Thus, ''foodies'' covers all those in the high-end restaurant business and their patrons.)</p>
        <p>Undoubtedly, the ultimate dining in Sydney is at Tetsuya's, housed in an old corner store in the inner suburb of Rozelle, about a 15-minute taxi ride from the city center. Launched more than a decade ago by Tetsuya Wakuda, a Japanese man who is a longtime resident of Australia, the restaurant combines Japanese inspiration, French technique and the freshest Australian produce of land and sea. After the 13-course degustation menu -- a sublime tartare of scampi with tomato sorbet to begin, a confit of Tasmanian ocean trout with roe and marinated celery in the middle and a finale of four desserts -- guests float out of the dining room on a cloud of tastes. Many courses are just a few delicious bites, served in shot glasses or martini glasses to show off the rainbow colors of the fish, caviar, vegetables, fruits and sorbets that dot the menu.</p>
        <p>If it proves too difficult to get into Tetsuya's, many other city restaurants combine Asian influences with Australian ingredients. In fact, most do. At Forty-One Restaurant, there are Yamba prawns in potato waistcoats on a sauce of Indian spices and, for dessert, a lemon-grass parfait. But the thing at Forty-One is the view and the history, which says a lot about cocky Sydney. It sits atop a 42-story office building in a penthouse that was originally destined to be the residence of Alan Bond, a high-flying businessman who ended up in jail on charges connected with the fraudulent sale of a Monet painting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bond was released from prison this year, and remains a hero to some Sydneysiders, who prefer to view him as the man who financed Australia's America's Cup yachting triumph in 1983, rather than the epitome of the country's corrupt business practices.</p>
        <p>Many of Sydney's simpler restaurants -- the corner cafe, the local neighborhood eatery -- are based on the successive waves of post-World War II immigration to Australia. First, Italians and Greeks came, many on assisted passages paid for by an Australian government anxious to fill out the sparse population. By the mid-1970's, when the discriminatory White Australia policy was put aside, Vietnamese, Chinese and Indian migrants arrived, infusing neighborhoods across Sydney with their cuisine and making the traditional Australian dish of a charred lamb chop and boiled green peas a thing of the past.</p>
        <p>To capture Sydney at its hedonistic best, a visitor must, at the very least, catch a ferry to a lunch spot by the water. Or hire your very own boat for a few hours, with a marvelous meal served on board -- for $300 an hour, in addition to food. Or, perhaps more practical, take a seaplane to Palm Beach, the northernmost city beach that is Sydney's sunny equivalent to the Hamptons.</p>
        <p>The dowager of Sydney Harbour is the Manly ferry, which has been running in one form or another for more than 100 years. Still a bargain -- $1.60 for half an hour on a slow boat from Circular Quay that winds its way across the harbor, between the floating gin palaces of the rich, spinnakered racing yachts, speedboats and even the occasional brave kayaker. The destination is Manly, a popular beach fringed with pines, and, sadly, some fairly ugly apartment blocks. But if you walk down the Corso and past the Bondi Surf Lifesavers Club, you will end up on a coastal walkway that 10 minutes later leads into Shelly Beach, a sheltered cove. Here one can have a seafood lunch -- or dinner -- at Le Kiosk, a charming eatery by the water.</p>
        <p>Another pleasant ride by ferry -- actually a speedy motorized catamaran -- goes to Watsons Bay. On the way you pass the waterfront of the eastern suburbs -- Darling Point, Point Piper, Double Bay, Rose Bay and Vaucluse -- where the sprawling houses of Sydney's tycoons (media bosses, racehorse owners, restaurant suppliers, nursing-home proprietors and high-technology investors) jostle each other for prime peeks of the harbor. At Watsons Bay, an inlet near the harbor opening, there are informal eateries for fish and chips to go or something grander.</p>
        <p>The seaplane from rose bay to Palm Beach flies low over the harbor and up the northern beaches, each crescent of sand and waves more enticing than the last. At Palm Beach, the plane swoops onto Pittwater, an apron of bayside saltwater packed with sleek sailboats and plump cruisers. A local boat hand with an outboard dinghy met the seaplane and took us ashore. We ate lunch at the Beach Road Restaurant -- saffron-infused red emperor fish -- and then asked a taxi to take us around to the surf for a walk along the sand and a drive around the eucalyptus-clad hills above the beach where Sydney's well-to-do network on weekends. Back at the beach, what better way to end a sojourn in Sydney than with a bottle of Australian Petaluma Crozer champagne and a view of the sun sparkling on the Pacific.</p>
        <p>Sojourning in Sydney</p>
        <p>Sydney HOTELS are almost entirely booked for the Olympics; for accommodation during the games, your best chance is to rent a house or a room in a private residence. Contact the Residential Accommodation program, sanctioned by the Olympics committee, of the Ray White Real Estate Agency (telephone: 61 3 9262-3700).</p>
        <p>For visits at other times, Sydney has hotels in all price categories, including such chains as Hilton, Hyatt, Inter-Continental, Sheraton and Regent, all of which may be booked from the United States. The following three are of special interest.</p>
        <p>THE KIRKETON, 229 Darlinghurst Road, Darlinghurst (61 2 9332-2011; fax: 61 2 9332-2499), is one of a growing number of boutique hotels. Forty minimalist rooms, ranging in price from $165 to $220, have down pillows and mohair throw rugs for a touch of softness. The added attraction is SALT, a fashionable restaurant on the first floor, which has received excellent reviews, about $120 for dinner for two, with wine.</p>
        <p>THE OBSERVATORY HOTEL, 89-113 Kent Street, (61 2 9256-2222; fax: 61 2 9256-2233), is probably the most luxurious in Sydney. Elegant rooms with traditional furnishings, opulent public spaces including the Globe Bar, with deep armchairs. An excellent health club includes an indoor pool (the ceiling painted with the galaxy to help you forget you are in the basement). Rooms start at $335 with a city view and $355 with a water view.</p>
        <p>THE RITZ-CARLTON DOUBLE BAY, 33 Cross Street (61 2 9362-4455; fax: 61 2 9362-4744), is well situated in the boutique- and cafe-laden Double Bay village, 10 minutes by taxi or ferry from downtown Sydney. Well appointed, classically furnished double rooms are $155 to $190.</p>
        <p>The city offers myriad RESTAURANT choices, from the unassuming neighborhood ethnic establishment to the very grand. TETSUYA'S, 729 Darling Street, Rozelle (61 2 9555-1017; fax: 61 2 9810-4824), offers the ultimate Sydney dining experience with a parade of 13 dishes on the special menu that includes such exotica as cold pasta with cauliflower, shelled champagne crab, snow egg and caviar. The 13 courses: $75 a person. An accompanying wine-tasting menu: $25 a person. Open lunch and dinner Tuesday through Friday; dinner only on Saturday. Reservations, preferably six weeks in advance, are essential.</p>
        <p>FORTY ONE RESTAURANT, Chifley Tower, Chifley Square (61 2 9221-2500; fax: 61 2 9221-5243), offers unsurpassed harbor and ocean views from 41 stories up. The food is New Australian and the atmosphere is clubby; service can be a bit haphazard. Dinner for two, with wine, about $150. Open lunch and dinner, Monday to Friday; dinner only on Saturday; lunch only on Sunday.</p>
        <p>HUGO'S, 70 Campbell Parade, Bondi (61 2 9300-0900; fax: 61 2 9300-9222), serves breakfasts at the weekend and smart new cuisine for dinner. Dinner for two, with wine, $70; breakfast for two, $25. Open every day for dinner, and for breakfast that extends into lunch on weekends.</p>
        <p>LE KIOSK, 1 Marine Parade, Shelly Beach (61 2 9977-4122; fax: 61 2 9977-3543), is situated on a secluded beach with views toward Manly Beach. Tables are set on a terrace or inside what was once a stone cottage. Seafood dominates the menu and includes Australia's classic fish and chips. Dinner for two, with wine, about $75. Open daily for lunch and dinner.</p>
        <p>BEACH ROAD RESTAURANT, 1 Beach Road, Palm Beach (61 2 9974-1159; fax: 61 2 9974-1168), is nestled among trees on the edge of the Palm Beach golf course. The food is delicately Asian in influence, including Thai salads with green mango. Dinner for two, $80. Open daily for lunch and dinner from November through February; the rest of the year, for dinner from Wednesday to Sunday and for lunch Friday to Sunday.</p>
        <p>MG GARAGE, a fashionable city restaurant at 490 Crown Street, Surry Hills, rents a 62-foot luxury motor cruiser, known as MV Garage, replete with chefs and waiters, for $300 an hour and $50 a head for a three-course meal, with wine, on the harbor (61 2 9383-9383).</p>
        <p>SYDNEY HARBOUR SEAPLANES, Lyne Park, Rose Bay (61 2 9388-1978; fax: 61 2 9371-0047), offers the 15-minute flight to Palm Beach for $130 a person, five passengers maximum. The planes can be hired for other destinations as well.</p>
