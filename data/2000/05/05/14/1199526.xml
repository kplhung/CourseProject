        <p>James Beathard  Executed 12/9/99</p>
        <p>James Lee Beathard received the death sentence for his role in the 1984 murder of Gene Hathorn Sr., 45, his wife, Linda Sue, 34, and their 14-year-old son, Marcus, while they were watching television in their mobile home outside Groveton, a small town in East Texas.</p>
        <p>There was no physical evidence to link Mr. Beathard to the crime -- no fingerprints, no footprints, no blood. After giving investigators several different versions of what happened on the murderous night, Mr. Beathard finally admitted he had been at the mobile home, that he had accompanied Gene Hathorn Jr. on what he thought was a drug deal. When Mr. Hathorn began shooting his family, Mr. Beathard said he ran into the woods and hid.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beathard was convicted largely on the testimony of Gene Hathorn Jr., who had wanted his family killed in order to collect a modest inheritance; after the murders, he discovered he had been written out of his father's will.</p>
        <p>At Mr. Beathard's trial, Mr. Hathorn testified that he had stood outside the trailer and fired a blast through the window with a shotgun; that had killed his father. Then, Mr. Hathorn -- who hoped that the state would go easier on him if he helped convict Mr. Beathard -- told the jury, Mr. Beathard, 24, a quiet, pot-smoking man who worked at the state mental hospital and had no experience with guns and no record of violence, had gone inside, brandishing a semi-automatic rifle and a semi-automatic pistol, and had finished off the victims.</p>
        <p>''Hathorn might be a cold-blooded killer, but there hasn't been any evidence in this courtroom that says he is a liar,'' the prosecutor, Joe L. Price, told the jurors. ''He is telling the truth.'' Mr. Beathard was convicted and sentenced to die.</p>
        <p>Then, several months later, Mr. Price tried Mr. Hathorn, who testified only at the punishment phase of his trial, hoping to avoid execution. Now Mr. Price in speaking to the jurors said that if they believed he was telling the truth, ''I'm a one-eyed hunting dog.''</p>
        <p>In his cross-examination of Mr. Hathorn, a man with a violent past and experience with guns, the prosecutor ridiculed the notion that Mr. Beathard, and not Mr. Hathorn, had gone inside and killed the family.</p>
        <p>''O.K., and here was this ol' boy that had never shot that pistol before, was not near as familiar as you with weapons, going into a house he had never been in before in his life, to attack two people that had some advance warning that he was coming,'' the prosecutor said to Mr. Hathorn. ''Does that seem a little bit strange to you, Gene?'' Mr. Hathorn was also convicted and sentenced to die. He remains on death row.</p>
        <p>A year after the trial, Mr. Hathorn recanted his testimony. He said that he had acted alone, that Mr. Beathard had been present but that he had hidden in the woods and had not participated in the killings. Based on this, Mr. Beathard's lawyers asked for a new trial. But the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals turned down the request because a criminal defendant has only 30 days after a judgment is entered against him to present new evidence that might justify a new trial.</p>
        <p>That 30-day period in Texas is longer than the 21-day deadline for the introduction of new evidence in Virginia, but it is still one of the shortest time periods in the country. Many states have no deadline.</p>
        <p>In a recent interview on death row at Livingston, Tex., Mr. Hathorn did not want to talk about the case. He put most of his answers ''off the record,'' even one on whether he still stuck to his recantation. He left no doubt, however, that he had been the one to go inside the trailer.</p>
        <p>Sixteen years after the Beathard trial, Mr. Price, the prosecutor, is still uncertain about what happened on the night of the crime. ''I'll be honest with you,'' he said, talking in his office in Groveton. ''I've vacillated on that one over the years.'' But he said that it did not matter what roles Mr. Hathorn and Mr. Beathard had played that evening since both were present -- under Texas ''law of parties'' they were equally guilty -- or even that Mr. Hathorn may have lied on the stand. ''Under Texas law my duty is to seek justice, and there is no question in my mind that these two people murdered the family,'' Mr. Price said.</p>
        <p>Not everyone agrees that justice was served.</p>
        <p>''Beathard should not have been put to death,'' said Mr. Burwell, a parole board member who voted with two others to have Mr. Beathard's sentence commuted to life in prison. Mr. Burwell explained why by getting out the Texas Code of Criminal Procedure and reading Article 2.0.1: ''It shall be the primary duty of all prosecuting attorneys, including any special prosecutors, not to convict, but to see that justice is done.'' He made a copy and handed it to a visitor. He had underlined the section, and double-underlined the word ''not.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Burwell believes that overzealous prosecutors are at the core of the problem with the Texas criminal justice system. ''If the prosecutor doesn't have integrity, there won't be justice,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Another member of the board, Linda Garcia, also voted for clemency. ''I don't believe anything improper happened with Beathard,'' said Ms. Garcia, a former prosecutor. ''My doubt is whether he deserved the death penalty.''</p>
        <p>Two jurors in the case recalled in recent interviews that they had been impressed by Mr. Price -- and less impressed by Mr. Beathard's court-appointed lawyer. ''It didn't seem to me like he was very forceful,'' one of the jurors, Dorothy Cates, said of Mr. Beathard's lawyer.</p>
        <p>Heber Taylor covered the Beathard and Hathorn trials for The Lufkin Daily News. Mr. Taylor asked Mr. Hathorn if Mr. Beathard had fired the shot from outside the trailer.</p>
        <p>''He just snorted in complete contempt,'' recalled Mr. Taylor, who is now editor of The Galveston Daily News. Mr. Beathard was too much of a patsy to kill anyone, Mr. Hathorn told Mr. Taylor.</p>
        <p>Steven Losch, a lawyer who does death penalty appellate work, said that when he first began working on Mr. Beathard's case he was uncertain whether he was innocent. But by a week before the execution, Mr. Losch had become convinced by Mr. Beathard's version of events.</p>
        <p>''This is the type of case that illustrates the risk of innocent people being executed in Texas,' Mr. Losch said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sutton said that Governor Bush ''felt there was no reason'' not to execute Mr. Beathard. A jury had found that he participated in the murders, the appellate courts had determined that he had a fair trial, and there was ''no mitigation'' that would warrant not putting him to death, Mr. Sutton said.</p>
        <p>Troy Farris</p>
        <p>Executed 1/13/99</p>
        <p>Three weeks before Christmas, a young deputy sheriff, Clark Rosenbalm Jr., was murdered, shot twice with a Magnum .357, when he chanced upon a drug deal, on an isolated road outside Fort Worth. Troy Dale Farris, who was part of the deal, was convicted of the murder, but the manner in which the investigation and trial were conducted left many uneasy, including a remarkable number of members of the parole board.</p>
        <p>The crime scene was badly trampled by investigators and onlookers. Sixty-three photographs of the sheriff's patrol car disappeared. So did the plaster casts taken of tire tracks in the area. Marijuana was found on Sheriff Rosenbalm, but an investigator flushed it down the toilet, or so he first claimed. The investigator was indicted for perjury and planting evidence. Then, after Mr. Farris's trial was over and he was on death row, the indictment of the investigator was dismissed.</p>
        <p>The Court of Criminal Appeals concluded that ''the circumstantial and forensic evidence offered at trial not only failed to connect'' Mr. Farris with the murder, but it ''also failed in nearly all material respects to confirm the testimony'' of the two key witnesses against Mr. Farris.</p>
        <p>Mr. Farris was convicted largely on the testimony of a brother-in-law, Jimmy Daniels, who claimed that Mr. Farris had confessed to him, albeit not until a year after the crime. Mr. Daniels also led police to an area where he said his brother-in-law had once fired his Magnum .357 into a tree. The police recovered slugs, but the markings did not match those of the bullets that killed the sheriff.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Daniels's ''credibility was seriously undermined by the fact that'' his testimony before the grand jury had been inconsistent with his trial testimony, ''and, therefore, inconsistent with'' Mr. Farris's guilt, the Court of Criminal Appeals found.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the court voted to affirm the jury's finding of guilt. As a guiding principle, unless the court concludes that a ''rational trier of fact'' could not have found the defendant guilty based on all the evidence before it, the court upholds the jury's decision.</p>
        <p>The case bothered members of the parole board more than just about any other that has come before them during Mr. Bush's tenure. Seven members voted for some form of clemency, either commutation or a 30-day reprieve.</p>
        <p>''I had some questions on the fairness'' of the prosecution, explained Daniel Lang, a Bush appointee to the board, who has a National Rifle Association emblem on his desk and signed photographs of himself with Presidents Gerald R. Ford and George Bush on the walls of his office in Angleton.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sutton, the criminal adviser to Governor Bush, said that the governor could have granted a reprieve, but that he had ''looked at all the facts of the case and chose not to.''</p>
        <p>David Castillo</p>
        <p>Executed 9/23/98</p>
        <p>Clarencio Champion was stabbed in a robbery of the Party House Liquor Store on North Texas Avenue in Mercedes, Tex. The injuries were not fatal, however, and he was recovering in the hospital, when, a week after the stabbing, he suddenly developed an infection and a high fever, and died. It turned out that during surgery, a nine-inch clamp had been left in Mr. Champion's stomach; Mr. Champion's widow eventually sued the doctor and the hospital for malpractice.</p>
        <p>But under Texas law, the person who set the events in motion that led to Mr. Champion's death could be prosecuted for capital murder, and that helped convict David Castillo, an 18-year-old high school dropout from Illinois, who had drifted down to South Texas. During Mr. Castillo's trial, the doctor testified that the leaving of the clamp inside Mr. Champion had been for the best because, he said, it prompted him to go back in and clean the wound.</p>
        <p>There was no direct evidence linking Mr. Castillo to the crime.</p>
        <p>About an hour after the robbery, Mr. Castillo appeared at a friend's home and washed his hands at an outside faucet. The police tested it for blood. ''It could not be determined whether the blood was human or not,'' the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Castillo, who had pleaded guilty to another robbery-stabbing committed a month before the Party House crime, lacked the means for a strong defense. The state gave him $500 for an investigator. The trial court turned down Mr. Castillo's lawyer's request for an additional $600. The court ruled that there was no legal obligation to provide Mr. Castillo with the additional money.</p>
        <p>Rob Owen, a death penalty appellate lawyer with the Austin firm Schonemann, Roundtree &amp; Owen, said that an adequate investigation would have required $5,000 to $10,000.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sutton, Governor Bush's criminal adviser, said it was difficult to know what it would have cost for a good investigation 17 years ago. He added, ''We do everything we can to put up enough money to represent these guys.''</p>
        <p>A critical witness against Mr. Castillo was Pedro Garcia, who was himself a suspect because he had worked across the street from the liquor store and knew Mr. Champion's pattern of going to and from the bank with money.</p>
        <p>At the time of the crime, Mr. Castillo was living with Mr. Garcia and his family in a public housing complex. Mr. Garcia testified that when Mr. Castillo came home late on the night of the robbery, his first words as he came though the door were, ''I did it.'' Mr. Castillo did not explain what it was he had done.</p>
        <p>The police searched Mr. Garcia's two-bedroom apartment. They found nothing. But the next day, his wife, Lucinda, found a bloody T-shirt and two money bags in a closet, and called the police.</p>
        <p>The jurors took only 45 minutes to find Mr. Castillo guilty. They might not have been so sure if Mr. Castillo's lawyers had found Pedro Garcia's uncle, Oscar Garcia.</p>
        <p>In a recent interview in his modest home in Mercedes, Oscar Garcia said things that might have led jurors to question Pedro Garcia's credibility. There was deep hatred, Mr. Garcia said, between the Garcia and Castillo families.</p>
        <p>Lucinda Garcia, 39, talked about the case in the four-room house in Mercedes where she is raising four of her children.</p>
        <p>''David, he never, ever admitted to it,'' she said. ''To this day, I wouldn't be sure he did it.''</p>
        <p>At the punishment phase of Mr. Castillo's trial, his sister and brother wanted to testify. But they could not afford to travel to Texas from their homes in the Midwest. And Mr. Castillo's lawyers did not ask the court for money to help them make the trip. Mitigating witnesses are essential if a jury is to be persuaded not to give a convicted murderer the death sentence.</p>
        <p>The character witnesses who did take the stand were not adequately prepared.</p>
        <p>''Neither one of the lawyers told us what they were going to ask us, or what kinds of things they wanted us to say,'' David Castillo's father, Juan Castillo Sr., said in an affidavit filed as part of his son's unsuccessful state habeas petition. ''I think I must have done more harm than good because I didn't know what to say.''</p>
        <p>It took the jury half an hour to vote the death sentence for Mr. Castillo, a sentence that Mr. Sutton, the Bush adviser, said was fair and supported by the case record.</p>
        <p>David Spence  Executed 4/3/97</p>
        <p>David Spence was executed in connection with the rape and torture murders of two 17-year-old girls and the murder of an 18-year-old boy in Waco. He received death sentences in two trials for the murders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spence, a roofer with a history of substance abuse, was accused of a murder-for-hire killing that went awry, in which the three victims died. Muneer Deeb, a convenience store owner, was also charged and sentenced to death in the case. But he received a new trial and was acquitted in 1993. Mr. Deeb died last November of liver cancer. He had steadfastly maintained that neither he nor Mr. Spence had anything to do with the killings.</p>
        <p>The original police homicide investigator, Ramon Salinas, acknowledged in the appeals process that he had serious doubts about Mr. Spence's guilt. In a sworn deposition given to Mr. Spence's lawyers in 1993, Marvin Horton, a former Waco police lieutenant who was involved in the case, said, ''I do not think David Spence committed this offense.''</p>
        <p>The prosecution built its case against Mr. Spence around bite marks -- a state expert said that bite marks on the body of one of the girls matched Mr. Spence's teeth -- and jailhouse snitches, both of which can be highly unreliable forms of evidence. Mr. Spence was already in prison, serving a 90-year sentence for aggravated sexual abuse of an 18-year-old man, when he was indicted for the Waco killings.</p>
        <p>Two of the six jailhouse witnesses who testified at trial subsequently recanted, saying they had been given cigarettes, television privileges and alcohol, and one of them had been allowed conjugal visits with a girlfriend, in exchange for their accusations against Mr. Spence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spence's post-conviction lawyers from the now-closed Texas Resource Center organized a blind panel study in which five experts -- odontologists -- said the bite marks could not be matched to Mr. Spence's teeth.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sutton, the governor's criminal justice adviser, said the verdict was fair and the death penalty was justified.</p>
        <p>With Governor Bush running for president, and the Texas death penalty system under heavier scrutiny, one of Mr. Spence's post-conviction lawyers, Raoul Schonemann, says ruefully that Mr. Spence is receiving more attention now than he did when his lawyers were fighting to save his life.</p>
        <p>''David certainly wanted us to persist in trying to bring out the truth,'' Mr. Schonemann said. ''I've always been willing to answer questions. But I feel very conflicted. It's competing with my time for our people who are living.''</p>
        <p>Odell Barnes  Executed 3/1/00</p>
        <p>Odell Barnes admitted to robbery and rape, and acknowledged that he was a crack  addict. But he went to his death maintaining that he had not raped and murdered Helen Bass.</p>
        <p>The lawyers who handled Mr. Barnes's final federal appeals, Mike Charlton, Philip Wischkaemper and Gary Taylor, were so certain of his innocence that they spent a good portion of their own money investigating his case.</p>
        <p>But like all death row inmates, once Mr. Barnes had entered the post-conviction phase, the burden was on him to prove not just that he was innocent, but that there had been constitutional errors in his case. It is extremely difficult to prove either one.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barnes's two court-appointed trial lawyers had done almost no investigation, Mr. Charlton said. They had not hired any scientific experts to look at the blood and semen that the prosecution said linked Mr. Barnes to the murder. And they only interviewed a few witnesses, he said.</p>
        <p>One of Mr. Barnes's trial lawyers had handled only one capital murder trial. The other lawyer had also handled one previous case, as a prosecutor.</p>
        <p>Police said Mr. Barnes had killed Ms. Bass, a 42-year-old nurse who was his mother's best friend, by bludgeoning her with a rifle butt and another heavy object, stabbing her and shooting her in the head. Semen found inside Ms. Bass matched that of Mr. Barnes. A fingerprint on a lamp, which police said may have been used to beat her, also belonged to Mr. Barnes. In addition, one dime-sized spot of blood on a pair of Mr. Barnes's coveralls, which the police had seized from his brother's car, matched that of Ms. Bass.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sutton said the state's case against Mr. Barnes was strong. But Mr. Charlton and his partners challenged the state's case  by establishing that Mr. Barnes had had a consensual sexual relationship with Ms. Bass. Mr. Barnes had told his lawyers that from the beginning, but they had apparently not listened, Mr. Charlton said.</p>
        <p>Bob Burtman of The Houston Press conducted an investigation of the 1991 murder, and the newspaper published a lengthy article in January that raised doubts about Mr. Barnes's guilt. Mr. Burtman found a letter Mr. Barnes had written in 1994 to his state habeas lawyer, saying that he had not raped Ms. Bass, that they had had a sexual relationship. Mr. Barnes said they had had sex two or three days before the murder.</p>
        <p>In addition to their sexual relationship, Mr. Barnes helped Ms. Bass with repairs around the house, and was a frequent visitor. That could have explained the fingerprint on the lamp, Mr. Charlton said. And while the prosecution had maintained that Ms. Bass had bought the lamp a week before  her death -- an assertion that went unchallenged at trial -- Mr. Barnes's final team of lawyers learned from Ms. Bass's son that the lamp was seven or eight years old.</p>
        <p>The tiny spot of blood on Mr. Barnes's coveralls was analyzed by Kevin Ballard, a leading forensic chemist who is a consultant to the F.B.I. The state had already run DNA tests confirming that the blood was Ms. Bass's. Mr. Ballard concluded that it contained extremely high levels of citric acid, which is used in vials to preserve blood. He said that the blood had either been planted or dropped accidentally on Mr. Barnes's coveralls.</p>
        <p>In addition to the new forensic evidence, Mr. Charlton and his partners interviewed new witnesses who contradicted all the testimony put on by the state at trial. The lawyers also found that the Wichita Falls Police  had botched the crime scene investigation, failing, among other things, to preserve a shoe print found at the scene and to test blood smeared all over the house.</p>
        <p>The federal and state courts both refused to allow Mr. Barnes's lawyers to present their new evidence. Finally, the United States Supreme Court refused to intervene.</p>
        <p>Correction:  June 17, 2000, Saturday  A related article that day, about five cases that resulted in executions, referred incorrectly to the trial lawyer for James Lee Beathard, who was executed in 1999. The lawyer was retained, not appointed.</p>
