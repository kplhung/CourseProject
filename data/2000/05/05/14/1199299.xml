        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The article ''Edith Wharton Gets the Treatment (3 ways)'' [April 30] leaves me sad, not amused. The parody misses its mark somehow; it's not really a joke. It happens all too often.</p>
        <p>You asked three writers for their approaches to filming a scene from Wharton's ''Summer.'' Why did you feel the need to sacrifice a great, unproduced, unexploited novel for a not-so-funny joke? The satirical scenes presented in your article illustrate how writers get so caught up in themselves and in impressing the Hollywood boys' club that they are beyond being able to have a sense of the other: to have a sense of what another human being is trying to say. As writer and director of a film adaptation of Eudora Welty's ''Why I Live at the P.O.,'' I am sensitive about the responsibility a writer has to the integrity of an adaptation. As an independent filmmaker, I have long considered adapting ''Summer.'' And as a woman, I wonder why you didn't consult at least one female writer. In omitting a woman's point of view of ''Summer,'' you further exemplified the blind power of the club.</p>

        <p>The movies that get made with the big Hollywood budgets are the ones that glorify the male ego, the unexamined life, the quick fix. I guess there's no time for that anymore -- or at least someone thinks there's no money in it. But I guarantee, if a filmmaker were able to remove his ego enough to truthfully adapt ''Summer'' to the screen in all its power and original glory, it would knock the audience's socks off.</p>
