        <p>MANY hotels claim to be a home away from home. But however warm the welcome, hotel life can pall pretty quickly. It's great to be pampered and waited on, with that fine concierge and a host of bustling bellboys. But sometimes more privacy and independence is preferable, as is being able to stock your own refrigerator. When you're tired of room service and restaurants, wouldn't it be nice to fix a chicken salad just the way you like it?</p>
        <p>A studio or one-bedroom apartment in a custom-built property may have twice the space for as little as half the cost of a standard double room in a hotel of the same quality.  Apartments in the United States and abroad range from converted town houses to modern ''aparthotels.'' There are often charming properties available in the center of such cities  as London and Paris. They typically have grand ground-  and first-floor apartments with high corniced ceilings, with smaller, cozier accommodations above. These tend to be smaller properties with 8 to 10 apartments, compared with 40 to 100 in a newer building.</p>

        <p>MANY hotels claim to be a home away from home. But however warm the welcome, hotel life can pall pretty quickly. It's great to be pampered and waited on, with that fine concierge and a host of bustling bellboys. But sometimes more privacy and independence is preferable, as is being able to stock your own refrigerator. When you're tired of room service and restaurants, wouldn't it be nice to fix a chicken salad just the way you like it?</p>
        <p>A studio or one-bedroom apartment in a custom-built property may have twice the space for as little as half the cost of a standard double room in a hotel of the same quality.  Apartments in the United States and abroad range from converted town houses to modern ''aparthotels.'' There are often charming properties available in the center of such cities  as London and Paris. They typically have grand ground-  and first-floor apartments with high corniced ceilings, with smaller, cozier accommodations above. These tend to be smaller properties with 8 to 10 apartments, compared with 40 to 100 in a newer building.</p>
        <p>Some of the most attractive properties are hard to find because they  typically don't advertise. Travel agents are becoming better versed as demand for these accommodations grows, but are often not familiar with the available apartments.  Leisure travelers usually stay two weeks or less while business travelers mostly account for longer stays.</p>
        <p>The Internet is the best way to get information, with pictures, maps and descriptions of facilities. Bookings can be made or requested online. A good site is that of Worldwide Apartments, at www.nothotels.com, (44-20) 7704 5040, which allows you to view and book 300,000 apartments.</p>
        <p>''Apartments are a fast-growing sector of the lodging industry,'' says Charles McCrow, managing director of the Apartment Service, in London, which has one of the best guides, the Worldwide Guide to Serviced Apartments; (44-20) 8944 1444, www .apartmentservice.com. ''We call  them serviced apartments, apart hotels or apartment suites; in the United States, where the concept began, they're called all-suite hotels or extended-stay hotels.''</p>
        <p>Travelers should be wary, he said, of hotels with apartments attached. Those quite often charge the same prices as they do for regular suites, so guests pay for hotel services even if they aren't using them.</p>
        <p>What to Expect</p>
        <p>Extra space begins to matter when you're constantly on the road or in one place for more than a few days. Apartments are an option that makes sense for two couples traveling together, or a family. Such accommodations range from studios to one-to-three-bedroom apartments with a lounge and en suite bathrooms. Most have direct-line phone and fax, cable or satellite TV. The kitchen is usually equipped with a toaster oven and microwave, refrigerator and freezer, perhaps a dishwasher, and pots, pans and dishes.  Maid service is usually once a week; you pay extra for daily cleaning.  Towels are changed at least once a week. Most apartments have a 24-hour reception desk. And you may get a free grocery shopping service.</p>
        <p>When booking, guests should ask about advance payment, deposits and cancellation penalties: there is normally no charge if you give four weeks' notice on a long-term rental. It is also wise to check on telephone and fax charges. They may not be cheaper than exorbitant hotel rates. But free access to phone card calls should be offered.</p>
        <p>Extended-stay hotels are enjoying a boom in the United States, with around 20 companies offering a range of apartments -- from hotel suites to long-stay residential properties. Extended Stay America, www.extstay.com, with more than 200 properties, is a lower-priced, fewer-frills alternative to Residence Inn by Marriott, www.residenceinn.com, which pioneered the idea in the early 1990's. Homestead Village, www .stayhsd.com, plans to build between 40 and 50 properties a year for the next three years. And Villager Lodge, www.villager.com, (800) 328-7829, a budget brand with weekly rates from $175 to $250, has about 125 properties now, and has just launched a new line called Premier, with rates of $250 to $375 and up.</p>
        <p>Staybridge Suites by Holiday Inn, which opened its first extended-stay hotel in Alpharetta, Ga., an Atlanta suburb, in December 1998, now has 15 properties with another 25 under construction -- 23 in the U.S., and one each in Toronto and in Sao Paulo. By 2001, the company expects to have 60 to 70 properties.</p>
        <p>Staybridge Suites, at www .staybridge.com, (800) 238-8000, is a kind of hybrid between a hotel and an apartment. There are two public areas, one with two computers for the use of guests (free); a fitness area; full front-desk service; a convenience store; and free laundry facilities. Prices depend on length of stay, season and location. Studios range from $89 to $109 for one to four nights to $59 to $89 a night for a stay of 15 to 30 days; two-bedroom two-bath suites range from $149 to $169 a night for one to four nights to $119 to $139 for 15 to 30 nights.</p>
        <p>Properties in Europe</p>
        <p>The major apartment chain in Europe is a French company, Citadines Apart'hotels, www.citadines.com,  (33-1) 41.05.79.05, recently acquired by Houston-based Westmont Hospitality, with 49 three-  and four-star properties in cities including Paris, Marseille, Montpellier, Strasbourg, Toulouse, Lyons, Nice, London, Brussels and Barcelona. Some, but not all,  are new or recently renovated. (The older ones tend to have more charm.)</p>
        <p>''We're very flexible -- you can stay for one night or one month,'' says Jan Dijksstra, development manager for Westmont in London. ''People who stay with us tend to be younger business travelers who know the city fairly well, and like to  organize themselves.'' Guests have  their own phone line, sometimes with voice mail; business services such as fax, e-mail and often conference rooms are available. A studio for two  at Paris Maine Montparnasse is $105  a night ($95 a night for seven nights).</p>
        <p>Central Apartments, at www .central-apartments.com, (44-20) 7608 9111, is a new chain with four luxury properties in central London. ''Designer'' studios and two-bedroom apartments ($150 to $275 a night) have pine floors and furniture and stainless-steel kitchen equipment. Circus Apartments, (44-20) 7719 7000, in Canary Wharf, which is set to open July 1, is a luxury property with 49 apartments $75 to $115 a night cheaper than neighboring five-star hotels such as the Four Seasons.</p>
        <p>When Cooking Is Too Much</p>
        <p>If you're chained to the desk in London waiting for Tokyo or Hong Kong to open or you're planning a crucial tete a tete dinner, Room Service Deliveries, (44-20) 7431 5555, (www.roomservice.co.uk), will deliver meals from more than 150 restaurants for a $6 delivery charge.  Their mobile bars offer reasonably priced wines -- cheaper than at a restaurant but more expensive than at a supermarket. Food is delivered piping hot in green ''butler bags'' by a fleet of bow-tied drivers.</p>
