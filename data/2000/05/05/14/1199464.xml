        <p>The year was 1792. The Revolutionary War was over, and one of its veterans, Isaac Smith, a farmer, doctor and deputy sheriff for the County of Westchester, was riding down to what is now the South Bronx to quell a problem in a tavern there.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith had been summoned by Levi Hunt, who was the owner of the tavern, the Hunts Inn, to apprehend a certain John Ryer, a wealthy British loyalist with a reputation as a rabble-rouser.</p>

        <p>The year was 1792. The Revolutionary War was over, and one of its veterans, Isaac Smith, a farmer, doctor and deputy sheriff for the County of Westchester, was riding down to what is now the South Bronx to quell a problem in a tavern there.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith had been summoned by Levi Hunt, who was the owner of the tavern, the Hunts Inn, to apprehend a certain John Ryer, a wealthy British loyalist with a reputation as a rabble-rouser.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Smith arrived at the inn, located near what is now the intersection of West Farms Road and 167th Street, he found Mr. Ryer to be heavily intoxicated and increasingly disorderly. The deputy sheriff tried to arrest him.</p>
        <p>According to court records, Mr. Ryer then pulled out two flintlock pistols and shot Mr. Smith dead.</p>
        <p>And so it was that on May 17, 1792, Isaac Smith became the first known police officer to be killed in the line of duty in the United States.</p>
        <p>As a result, Mr. Smith's name was carved earlier this month into the National Law Enforcement Memorial, a monument in Washington that displays the names of more than 14,500 officers killed in the line of duty in this country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith's story would not be known except for Michael Bosak, a retired city police officer and an amateur police historian, who found records about Mr. Smith in the Westchester County archives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bosak, who lives in the Throgs Neck section of the Bronx, has dedicated himself to gaining recognition for all police officers in New York City and environs who have been killed in the line of duty.</p>
        <p>''It feels great to see him be recognized,'' said Mr. Bosak, who speaks emotionally of other fallen officers. ''Every last one of these guys deserves to be honored.''</p>
        <p>The sheriffs' departments of both the city and Westchester County rallied to Mr. Bosak's cause, petitioning the Washington memorial keepers to recognize Mr. Smith.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bosak, who has written an unpublished history of the New York Police Department in the Bronx,  says that he has a list with 62 names of fallen police officers. None of these deaths has yet been recognized by city officials -- a necessary step in the placement of their names on the national monument.</p>
        <p>What about Mr. Ryer? After the murder, he fled to Canada, where good British loyalists went, Mr. Bosak said. But he was later apprehended and convicted for his crime on Sept. 5, 1793.</p>
        <p>Less than a month later, he was hanged in the rear of the Old Westchester County Court House in White Plains.</p>
