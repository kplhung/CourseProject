        <p>ONE year ago, the fast-moving, darkly funny series ''Queer as Folk'' scorched the British television landscape. The show, about a group of gay men in Manchester, was marked by so much graphic language and explicit sex -- some of it with a 15-year-old boy -- that just about everyone seemed outraged. At least at the outset.</p>
        <p>''It was absolutely torn apart by the right-wing press, by the left-wing press, by gay people, by straight people,'' said Russell T.

''Now I'm eager to see what you Americans do with it.''</p>

        <p>ONE year ago, the fast-moving, darkly funny series ''Queer as Folk'' scorched the British television landscape. The show, about a group of gay men in Manchester, was marked by so much graphic language and explicit sex -- some of it with a 15-year-old boy -- that just about everyone seemed outraged. At least at the outset.</p>
        <p>''It was absolutely torn apart by the right-wing press, by the left-wing press, by gay people, by straight people,'' said Russell T. Davies, the cheerful, 37-year-old Welsh-born writer who created the series for Britain's Channel 4. He laughed. ''There was nothing like that show on British television,'' he said. ''Now I'm eager to see what you Americans do with it.''</p>
        <p>He doesn't have to wait too long.</p>
        <p>After five months of negotiations, the Showtime cable network has picked up ''Queer as Folk'' and plans to turn it into a 22-episode series set in a blue-collar Eastern city, probably Pittsburgh. Executives at Showtime, who vied with HBO for the series and are plainly seeking to be more competitive with that highly successful cable network, said that ''Queer as Folk'' would be as explicit in the United States as it was in Britain.</p>
        <p>''I thought this show was unique,'' said Jerry Offsay, Showtime's president of programming. ''I had never seen characters like these on television. The characters were unapologetic, they lived their lives the way they wanted to. There were great twists and turns and reverses in the storytelling. This show will be as edgy as any television series has ever been in America.''</p>
        <p>The American version, which is now being written and is set to be broadcast later in the year, will mirror the British show -- with one significant difference. The firestorm that rocked Britain after the first episode of ''Queer as Folk'' was set off in large part by the affair the 29-year-old lead character, Stuart, has with Nathan, who is 15. An advertising man consumed with the hunt for sex, Stuart has a best friend, Vince, who has been entranced with him for years. But the icily seductive Stuart cares only about having sex as often as he can with as many men as he can.</p>
        <p>In the American version, the youth will be nearly 18. ''The boy is on the cusp of being the legal age,'' said Tony Jonas, one of the executive producers of the series and a former president of Warner Brothers Television. ''The idea is, kids who are seniors in high school are being sexual. We can't deny that. It's the reality.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jonas had been trying to sell Mr. Offsay another show when the Showtime executive asked him to be one of the producers of ''Queer as Folk.''  ''When I first saw the material,'' said Mr. Jonas, ''there was a sense of shock. But once you got past the shock, this was solid, intelligent and caustically funny material.''</p>
        <p>Joining Mr. Jonas as executive producers of the series are Rob Cowen and Daniel Lipman, who are also writing the first episodes. Mr. Cowen and Mr. Lipman created the NBC series ''Sisters'' and won an Emmy for their 1985 drama, ''An Early Frost,'' one of the first television films about AIDS.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cowen said: ''There are a lot of gay characters in commercial television and films now, but not a show like this. There's never been anything like this. It's an odd mix of very graphic material that's also witty and charming.''</p>
        <p>He said Showtime had placed no restraints on the writing team. ''We will not be accused of watering down the series,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lipman said the producers and Showtime wanted to avoid setting the series in a heavily gay neighborhood like New York's Chelsea, Los Angeles's West Hollywood or San Francisco's Castro district.</p>
        <p>''We wanted it in a place where you couldn't say, 'It's those people out there,' '' Mr. Lipman said. ''These characters don't work in entertainment or fashion. They're average people in an average town.''</p>
        <p>The British series was set not in London but in Manchester, where Mr. Davies lives. ''I didn't want to write something with a message,'' said Mr. Davies, who has spent most of his career writing dramas and soap operas for British television. ''Because I'm gay, I was always putting in gay characters in my plays. In this case, I wanted to entertain and captivate an audience. All right, they're gay. Let's get on with the story.''</p>
        <p>The reaction to the British show in some ways followed his formula. The initial wave of shock had disappeared by the time the eight hourlong episodes of ''Queer as Folk'' had completed their run in 1999. (They were followed by a two-hour show this year.)</p>
        <p>Initially, gay groups objected to what they saw as the show's sensationalism, fearing that its affluent, promiscuous and thoroughly vapid characters would feed into gay stereotypes. Critics, especially in conservative newspapers, denounced the characters' freewheeling sexuality and were shocked by the underage sex. But like most of the characters in the British series, Nathan -- who wants a real relationship and not a one-night stand -- turned into a more complex and stronger figure as each episode unfolded.</p>
        <p>''What's surprising to me is that the criticism didn't just calm down, it actually reversed itself,'' Mr. Davies said. ''A reviewer in The Daily Mail, who hated it at first, said later that she felt it was the most important piece of television in years.''</p>
        <p>No actors have been cast for the American series. But several writers who have written gay-themed plays, films or television dramas have joined the show: Richard Kramer (''Tales of the City''), Jonathan Tolins (''Twilight of the Golds'') and Jason Schafer (''Trick'').</p>
        <p>In some ways, making a risky show like ''Queer as Folk'' has no downside for Showtime. The network, with 22.3 million subscribers, has for years struggled in the shadow of HBO, which has 35.7 million. And ''Queer as Folk'' will, if nothing else, attract attention.</p>
        <p>Mr. Offsay said Showtime's pledge to turn ''Queer as Folk'' into a long-running series was a decisive factor in the decision by Channel 4 and Mr. Davies to sell the rights to the cable network. ''Our willingness to go straight to a 22-episode series probably prevailed in the end,'' Mr. Offsay said. At the same time, the network is committed to sticking as closely as possible to the tone and content of the British series, especially in the matter of sexual candor.</p>
        <p>''We run R-rated movies as a staple of our service,'' Mr. Offsay said. ''The content can be edgy. We don't develop cop shows, or lawyer shows, or doctor shows. People get them free on every network. We're always looking for something better.''</p>
        <p>He believes that because there will be so many more episodes of the American series, the writers will be able to turn some of the British version's lesser characters into prominent figures. This will include a lesbian couple who have just had a baby.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Davies said he had initially been nervous about the American version. ''I was worried that it might become blander,'' he said. But after reading a draft of the opening two-hour episode, Mr. Davies said he believed his fears were unwarranted. ''I picked it up with trepidation,'' he said. ''But I'm really pleased. They were remarkably faithful.''</p>
        <p>''Good stories never die, and this is a good story,'' he added. ''So we're telling the story in different ways and in different settings, reinventing the story. And that's what you should do.'' He laughed. ''I can't wait to see it.''</p>
