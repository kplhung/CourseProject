        <p>LAST week, Roman Catholics in New York began to take the measure of their next archbishop, Edward M. Egan, who has been bishop of Bridgeport, Conn., for more than a decade. At a press conference Thursday, hours after the Vatican announced the appointment, the archbishop-elect showed himself to be multilingual, answering questions in English, Italian and Spanish.</p>
        <p>Bishop Egan comes to his new post with a reputation as an effective administrator and fund-raiser.</p>
        <p>But another way to view the bishop's selection is from the perspective of the appointments made by Pope John Paul II. Simply put, the pontiff has reshaped the American church hierarchy as perhaps none of his predecessors has. He has filled vacancy after vacancy with men who share his own vision of how the church should be run -- and not just in the United States, but in other parts of the world as well.''</p>
        <p>The process has been gradual, but its effect has been profound. John Paul, moreover, has begun a second round of appointments, selecting prelates to succeed bishops he himself once appointed.</p>
        <p>By 1989, in his 11th year as pope, John Paul had chosen leaders for the archdioceses of Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and Washington; these occupants traditionally become cardinals. In the 11 years since, he has repeated the process, with Cardinal Adam Maida in Detroit succeeding Cardinal Edmund Szoka, who was chosen in 1981; Cardinal Francis George in Chicago replacing the late Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, appointed in 1982; and now Bishop Egan in New York succeeding the late Cardinal John O'Connor, appointed in 1984.</p>
        <p>John Paul may go on to select new archbishops for Philadelphia and Washington, to succeed Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, who was appointed in 1988, and Cardinal James Hickey, a 1980 appointment. Both men are long past the official church retirement age of 75. The pope has also named new archbishops for major sees like Atlanta, Denver, St. Louis and many others.</p>
        <p>Based on the number of appointments, the Rev. David M. O'Connell, president of the Catholic University of America, in Washington, said John Paul II has ''had the most influence of any pope in modern times.''</p>
        <p>Longevity has helped. Elected in 1978 at a relatively youthful 58, John Paul II, who turns 80 on Thursday, has reigned longer than any other 20th-century pope -- longer than all but six of his 261 predecessors. But more than simply benefiting from a long life, John Paul II has demonstrated that he knows which characteristics he wants in the men in the front ranks.</p>
        <p>Taken individually, the current crop of American cardinals are known for various strengths. Chicago's Cardinal George, for example, is highly regarded as an intellectual; Cardinal William Keeler in Baltimore is considered a leader in ecumenical relations.</p>
        <p>BUT the cardinals share important, basic qualities. They are ''doctrinally steadfast,'' thoroughly loyal to the Vatican, said Chester Gillis, associate professor of theology and Catholic studies at Georgetown University in Washington. ''I think there's a premium put on obedience to Rome, particularly for cardinals,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In short, they are not inclined to innovation. In 1980, the pope warned some of the Latin American bishops against embracing political ideas arising from liberation theology, which states a preference for the poor. Speaking in Mexico that year, he said church leaders must safeguard ''the purity of doctrine.''</p>
        <p>These days the American bishops are more cautious than they were 15 years ago, when the National Conference of Catholic Bishops engaged in sweeping pastoral letters on such broad and highly charged topics as war and peace, and American capitalism.</p>
        <p>''You see no moves by the bishops to write a major pastoral letter,'' said the Rev. Thomas Reese, editor of the Jesuit magazine America, who is an authority on the bishops' conference. ''They passed Ex Corde Ecclesia the way the Vatican wanted it,'' he said, referring to a long-discussed document on the relationship between Catholic colleges and the church hierarchy, adopted by the bishops last November. It contained a controversial provision that will require theologians to obtain a mandate from their local bishop certifying that what they are teaching is fully within church doctrine. ''The new generation of bishops,'' Father Reese said, ''is not going to argue with the Vatican on these issues.''</p>
        <p>That new generation will be leading the church for some years. (It is a group of prelates that in the United States remains overwhelmingly white, even as recent immigration has made the people in the pews more ethnically diverse, a change that will take some time to make itself more apparent in the hierarchy.)</p>
        <p>FATHER REESE, who studies appointments to the College of Cardinals in Rome, said that more than 90 percent of its voting members -- the prelates under age 80 -- owe their status to John Paul II. The 120-member body will select his successor.</p>
        <p>''His influence will not end with his death,'' Professor Gillis said. ''His influence will go on for a number of years after his papacy.''</p>
