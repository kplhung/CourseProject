        <p>Seattle certainly made a name for itself last December as host to the World Trade Organization meeting. The boosters' idea of using the summit to show off their city as a world-class friend to free trade didn't exactly pan out, amid all the demonstrations and the tear gas, but many residents think that the raucous  protests against globalization amounted to a badge of honor for Seattle.</p>
        <p>Now the long-running tension here, between those who revel in the high-tech, high-wealth place Seattle has become and those who fret that the city is losing its quirky small-town charm, has a new focus: next month, a museum designed by Frank Gehry, known as the Experience Music Project, opens at the base of the Space Needle. Wildly curvy and colorful, built roughly in the shape of a guitar with the Seattle Center's monorail running through it, the museum is a celebration of modern music and includes a sound lab that, the museum says, lets you ''plug in, jam, dance, wail, scratch, learn, connect and, ultimately, experience the euphoria of making music.'' Some consider the building a brilliant addition to the architectural scene; some call it a curse on the civic landscape. Come and judge for yourself.</p>

        <p>Now the long-running tension here, between those who revel in the high-tech, high-wealth place Seattle has become and those who fret that the city is losing its quirky small-town charm, has a new focus: next month, a museum designed by Frank Gehry, known as the Experience Music Project, opens at the base of the Space Needle. Wildly curvy and colorful, built roughly in the shape of a guitar with the Seattle Center's monorail running through it, the museum is a celebration of modern music and includes a sound lab that, the museum says, lets you ''plug in, jam, dance, wail, scratch, learn, connect and, ultimately, experience the euphoria of making music.'' Some consider the building a brilliant addition to the architectural scene; some call it a curse on the civic landscape. Come and judge for yourself.</p>
        <p>Dot-com frenzy and cultural activity of all kinds continue to bloom and, as always, late spring and summer remain a time when the natural grandeur in and around Seattle is on particularly glorious display. For information, call the Convention and Visitors Bureau, (206) 461-5840.</p>
        <p>Events</p>
        <p>The Experience Music Project, at the base of the Space Needle, (206) 367-5483, is scheduled to open June 23, but several events before then may allow visitors a peek inside this wacky building. Expect long lines at the make-your-own music studio, but with 3,000 items on view (including Jimi Hendrix's Woodstock guitar) and an archive of Pacific Northwest bands on tap, much else can be seen -- and heard. E.M.P., as it is already known, bills itself as offering ''an interactive tribute to the evolution of American popular music through rock 'n' roll, jazz, soul, gospel, country, blues, hip-hop and punk.''</p>
        <p>On May 26 to 29, the Northwest Folklife Festival, at Seattle Center, (206) 684-7300, features over 5,000 participants with a range of arts and crafts, wandering performers, and stage presentations, not to mention the food, all intended to show off Seattle's world connections.</p>
        <p>Watch out for flying fish (that's how many vendors get them across the counter to customers) at the Pike Place Market Festival, a celebration of the city's famous fish and farm market May 28 and 29. Hours: 10 a.m. to 7 p.m.; First Avenue and Pike Street; (206) 587-0351.</p>
        <p>The Seattle Film Festival, (206) 324-9996, is a launching pad for  foreign and independent American films bypassed by the local cineplex. The festival begins Thursday with the North American premier of Kenneth Branagh's version of ''Love's Labor's Lost'' and runs through June 11 at various locations.</p>
        <p>Opened in 1998, Benaroya Hall, 200 University Street, (206) 215-4747, is the home of the Seattle Symphony. In May and June the symphony, under the direction of Gerard Schwarz, will present a range of concerts, many as part of its ''Music of Our Time'' and ''Discover Music!'' series.</p>
        <p>Sightseeing</p>
        <p>Seattle boasts many bike trails offering glorious vistas of the city, Puget Sound and both the Olympic and Cascade Mountains. At Blazing Saddles Bike Rentals, 1230 Western Avenue, (206) 341-9994, bikes (with helmet, locks and other accessories included) rent for $5 an hour and up.</p>
        <p>If you don't feel so fleet of foot, join the other tourists and take Argosy Cruises' two-hour Lake Washington tour, which passes houseboats and the University of Washington campus on its way to the Gold Coast on the lake's east side. The boat passes by the famous techno-palace owned by Bill and Melinda Gates; a guide helpfully pointed out the trampoline room one recent day, where, she said, Mr. Gates ''can go and bounce all his troubles away.'' Argosy, (206) 623-4252, also has tours of Puget Sound and dinner cruises. The Lake Washington tour is $24.</p>
        <p>A cheaper but no less splendid way of seeing Seattle and the surrounding mountains is to climb aboard one of the many state ferries, which travel to nearby Bainbridge Island from Pier 52 downtown. Foot passengers  pay $3.70 round trip; (206) 464-6400.</p>
        <p>The Elliott Bay Book Company, one of the nation's best and largest independent bookstores, is a beloved institution, with a program of author readings and talks. It is an inviting place to meet a friend for coffee or browse for hours amid the Western red cedar shelves, at 101 South Main Street; (206) 624-6600.</p>
        <p>The Seattle Art Museum, in a soaring Robert Venturi building at 100 University Street, (206) 654-3100, has an extensive collection of Northwest Indian, African, Impressionist, Greek and other art. The museum is also affiliated with the Seattle Asian Art Museum, 1400 East Prospect Street in Volunteer Park, which has a remarkable collection of art and artifacts from China, India, Korea and Japan. Both are open Tuesday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Thursday till 9. Suggested admission is $7 for the Seattle Art Museum, $3 for the Asian Art Museum.</p>
        <p>The University of Washington has two outstanding museums on campus: the Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture, with permanent exhibitions on native art and Pacific Rim cultures, and the Henry Art Gallery, concentrating on modern and contemporary art, with a show through Aug. 20 on how technology has altered the American landscape. The Burke, (206) 543-5590, is open daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Thursday till 8; admission $5.50. The Henry, Northeast 41st and 15th Avenue NE, (206) 543-2280, is open daily except Monday 11 a.m. to 5 p.m., Thursday till 8; admission $5.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>The visitors bureau's hotel line, (800) 535-7071, often features deals well below advertised prices.</p>
        <p>The Inn at the Market, 86 Pine Street, (206) 443-3600, fax (206) 448-0631, has 70 antiques-filled rooms, many with views of the Pike Place Market, Elliott Bay and the Olympic Mountains. Doubles start at $170. Even if your room doesn't have a view, the rooftop balcony does, and is accessible to all guests.</p>
        <p>''Sleep with the fishes'' is the unusual offer made by the Hotel Monaco, 1101 Fourth Avenue, (206) 621-1770, fax (206) 621-7779, which promises to put a goldfish in a bowl in your room if you desire such company. The European-style boutique hotel has 189 rooms. Doubles from $195.</p>
        <p>The Beatles slept there, and there's a 1964 picture of them fishing from the window of their suite to prove it at the 236-room Hotel Edgewater, Pier 67, 2411 Alaskan Way; (206) 728-7000, fax (206) 441-4119. The exterior is being remodeled in a style the hotel describes as Paul Bunyan meets high tech, and the rooms are Northwestern lodge style, many with stunning water and mountain views. Doubles from $169.</p>
        <p>Budget: The 24-room Ace Hotel, 2423 First Avenue; (206) 448-4721, fax (206) 374-0745, advertised as a place for the ''urban nomad on a mission for experience,'' is not for everybody. But it is an epicenter of Seattle's hipster scene, surrounded by stores and galleries in the Belltown area near downtown, a former flophouse for sailors that has been converted into a chic, sleek place with low beds and interesting steel fittings. Where one might normally look for the Gideon's Bible, expect to find stylized copies of the Kama Sutra. Standard rooms, with shared bath, start at $65; suites with private bath at $130.</p>
        <p>The Seattle Inn, 225 Aurora Avenue North near downtown, (206) 728-7666, fax (206) 728-6108, has 159 standard rooms, an indoor pool, a whirlpool and parking. Double rates with Continental breakfast range from $59 to $115.</p>
        <p>Luxury: The Four Seasons Olympic Hotel, 411 University Street, (206) 621-1700, fax (206) 682-9633, painstakingly restored several years ago to its pre-Depression Italianate Renaissance glory, has 450 spacious, classically decorated rooms, including 209 suites, and a chandeliered lobby and adjoining lounge. Rooms start at $305.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>Cascadia is one of those places that have some Seattleites raving that the city's restaurant scene has gone world-class and others saying that it's all getting a bit too showy. Indeed, the food is great, but expensive (French-press coffee, at $8 a cup, is high even for the city that gave us Starbucks). The restaurant features cherrywood paneling, a frosted glass waterfall of a wall dividing the dining area and kitchen, and a cozy bar. The food, all themed as Northwestern (defined as northern California up to Alaska, and the Pacific over to Montana), comes in the form of six rotating fixed-price tasting menus, in addition to the regular menu, from a vegetarian option at $65 to the ''Decidedly Northwest'' fare, including a salad of chilled dungeness crab with celery root and apple, salmon ''prepared two ways,'' and Washington beefsteak with garlic straw fries, for $95. The extensive wine list features Washington and Oregon producers, but has many others as well. Cascadia is at 2328 First Avenue, between Bell and Battery; (206) 448-8884.</p>
        <p>Cafe Campagne, 1600 Post Alley, (206) 728-2233, is a delightful Parisian-style bistro half a block from the Pike Place Market, serving breakfast, lunch and dinner daily and a Sunday brunch. A good appetizer is the port and pistachio crepinettes, served with a roasted red beet and arugula salad and dressed with horseradish vinaigrette. Specialties include pan-sauteed boneless trout with steamed potatoes and an almond, lemon and brown-butter pan sauce, and a daily rotisserie offering. Dinner for two, with wine, about $110.</p>
        <p>The bounty of the northwest's waters -- clams, oysters, crabs, mussels, salmon, halibut -- is astonishing. At Etta's Seafood, 2020 Western Avenue, (206) 443-6000, the menu often changes depending on what's freshest, but among the best of the regulars is Etta's spice-rubbed and pit-roasted Alaskan king salmon with cornbread pudding and shiitake relish, or the sea scallops with udon noodles in a lemongrass-miso broth. Dinner for two, with wine: $120.</p>
        <p>In a city with so many quirky neighborhoods, it follows that some of the most interesting restaurants are well away from the downtown lights. In the Phinney Ridge area, Carmelita offers ''savory vegetarian fare'' in its colorful dining room and also in a back patio enclosed by an herb garden. The seasonal menu is strictly vegetarian and vegan, but creative enough that confirmed meat-eaters will make repeat visits.  Among current offerings are a phyllo tart with roasted portobello mushrooms topped with a truffle-arugula salsa, and pappardelle pasta with spring peas, pea tendrils, lemon balm and organic barrel-aged feta cheese. Dinner for two, with drinks from the extensive wine and microbrew list: $80. Open nightly except Monday; 7314 Greenwood Avenue North; (206) 706-7703.</p>
        <p>At the Noodle Ranch, 2228 Second Avenue, (206) 728-0463, the pan-Asian menu, under the supervision of the Vietnamese chef, Nga Bui, offers an array of moderately priced dishes: Mekong grill with tofu or meat in a Vietnamese-style marinade, house pad Thai, Singapore noodles, spicy Japanese eggplant in a ginger sauce, Laotian cucumber salad, Saigon-style lemongrass chicken, and on and on. An excellent lunch or dinner, daily except Sunday, can cost as little as $12 a person.</p>
