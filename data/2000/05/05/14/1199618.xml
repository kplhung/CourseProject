        <p>Amy Linnen, who set a national high school girls' indoor record in the pole vault at 12 feet 10 inches in February, continued her winning ways outdoors yesterday. The senior at Long Island's Mt. Sinai High School cleared 12-0 to win the event easily at the 33rd annual Loucks Games on the White Plains High School field in Westchester.</p>
        <p>Linnen set the national girls' indoor mark at the Eastern States Championships and won the New York State crown as well. Outdoors, she won the vault at the Penn Relays two weeks ago and last week at the St. Anthony's Invitational meet</p>

        <p>Amy Linnen, who set a national high school girls' indoor record in the pole vault at 12 feet 10 inches in February, continued her winning ways outdoors yesterday. The senior at Long Island's Mt. Sinai High School cleared 12-0 to win the event easily at the 33rd annual Loucks Games on the White Plains High School field in Westchester.</p>
        <p>Linnen set the national girls' indoor mark at the Eastern States Championships and won the New York State crown as well. Outdoors, she won the vault at the Penn Relays two weeks ago and last week at the St. Anthony's Invitational meet</p>
        <p>The Loucks event, which was designated by the United States Track and Field Association as the United States meet on the World Athletics Day yesterday, drew 1,400 entries from 175 high schools in 11 states and Canada. As part of the World Athletics Day, 11 of these athletes will be entered in a summer draw by the International Amateur Athletic Federation that will select one boy and one girl from each continental area of the world for an all-expenses-paid trip to the 2001 World Championships in Edmonton, Alberta.</p>
        <p>In another early girls' final yesterday, Paula George of Taft High in the Bronx, and Chinela Davis, a North Rockland, N.Y., junior, tied at 18 feet 6i inches in the long jump. The tie, however, was broken by their second best jumps. Davis's second best leap of 18-4 barely edged George's 18-3 for the gold medal.</p>
        <p>George, a senior, and Davis each advanced to the semi-finals of the 200-meter dash. George also advanced in the 100-meter preliminaries, winning her heat in 12.80 seconds.</p>
        <p>Adam Gelardi of Iona Prep in New Rochelle, N.Y., took the boys' shot put at 55-2 and Chris Clifton of Deep Creek High School, Chesapeake, Va., won the boys' long jump at 22-6i in other early event finals yesterday.</p>

        <p>GREENE WINS 100: Maurice Greene bolted into the international track season yesterday by winning the 100 meters in 9.91 seconds in the Japan Grand Prix in Osaka.</p>
        <p>Greene's time was shy of his world record of 9.79, but placed him well ahead of his competition. Obadele Thompson of Barbados finished second in 10.13, while Bruny Surin of Canada came in third in 10.24.</p>
        <p>Things did not go as well for another American star, Marion Jones. She got off to a good start with a victory in the 100 in 10.84 seconds, but failed in the day's greatest challenge - the long jump - coming in fourth at 20 feet 7 inches. Jones lost to Yingnan Guan of China, who leaped 21 feet 11 3/4 inches. (AP)</p>
