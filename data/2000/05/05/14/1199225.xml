      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>1. Ben Watts's brief stint as a wedding photographer took place in Australia, where he was studying photography a decade ago. To butter up a teacher, he volunteered to shoot his wedding. And the results were so fantastic (and cheap!) -- even if Watts says so himself -- that hordes of lovebirds started to call, and suddenly every Saturday was devoted to other people's connubial bliss. Watts exchanged his own vows at 1 Centre Street last June, on his lunch hour. And being the romantic he is, he restaged the experience for our shoot, right down to the subway ride over. But, alas, there was no Sammy's Roumanian restaurant at the end of the day. ''We had what is called a blessing in Wales, about a month later,'' he says. ''So now I've got two anniversaries, which is kind of annoying.''</p>
        <p>2. The N.Y.P.D. is not exactly romantic, either. About eight minutes into the shoot, an undercover cop gave Watts a summons for blocking the stairwell to the 23rd Street subway entrance.</p>
        <p>3. Though the preceding pages were an exercise in fantasy, not everything was fake. The ''bride'' and ''groom,'' Dawning and Jinn Gussenhoven, are actually married, and all of the other characters appear with their significant others. Of the people who were truly getting hitched at the Municipal Building that day, all but Gaile Frejoles refused to let us dress them. No fool, Frejoles picked a $58,000 Christina Perrin gown.</p>
        <p>4. Paula Pagan has been marrying people in the city's chapel since 1989. Of the 70 to 80 ceremonies performed each day, Pagan is fairly certain that someone will forget a ring (''They use rubber bands'') and someone will chicken out (''Right in the middle'').</p>
        <p>5. And speaking of forgetting things, should you forget your bouquet, they sell a funky silk one in the lobby of the Municipal Building for $20. Miho Kosuda sews this bouquet (a) from 80 rose petals; $350, (212) 922-9122. And Violette Nozieres's lovely rose-petal bag (b) may obviate the need for a bouquet entirely; $215, (212) 874-6412.</p>
        <p>6. Weddings at Sammy's Roumanian Steak House are very haimish, according to the owner, Stan Zimmerman, whose middle name is Sammy. The 25-year-old restaurant at 157 Chrystie Street -- known for its make-your-own egg creams, vodka in ice and heavy helpings of schmaltz -- is host to about a dozen weddings a year. One hapless groom missed smashing the glass three times. ''His bride,'' Zimmerman says, ''threatened to spritz him with seltzer.''</p>
        <p>7. The premiere issue of Wedding Gowns (a) has 1,400 pictures of wedding gowns, making your once-in-a-lifetime decision that much more confusing ($9.99,at newsstands). Less confusing: this Nikon Nuvis S camera (b) engraved with the name of the happy couple. It's the perfect gift for the bridal party; $250, J &amp; R Music World, 31 Park Row.</p>
        <p>8. O.K., you've thought of everything, right down to these (a) specialty cake toppers; www.theperfectcouple .com. But you're living in a fool's paradise unless you've invested $13.50 in Lipstick Sealer (b), which shellacs the color right onto your kisser; Laura Geller, 1044 Lexington Avenue.</p>
        <p>9. To rent while you still have a sense of humor: Ang Lee's 1993 ''Wedding Banquet,'' a sweet East-meets-West, boy-meets-boy-but-has-to-marry-girl comedy that's the apotheosis of the City Hall-wedding genre.</p>
        <p>10. Crystal and china are still at the top of Tiffany's wedding registry,</p>
        <p>but it's a groom's world at Home Depot, where the top bridal requests include the Ridgid Wet/Dry Vacuum ($69) and the Husky seven-piece screwdriver set ($9.98). Sorry, guys, not all Home Depots participate.</p>
