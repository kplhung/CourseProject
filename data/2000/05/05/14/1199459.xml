        <p>Site designs for six ferry landings along the East River are being drawn up this month, but residents near sites that have been selected are worried that passengers would bring noise, crowds, traffic and congestion to their quiet neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>Residents aired their fears at a meeting sponsored by Community Board 8 earlier this month, which attracted 150 people.</p>
        <p>''Many people think ferry service is a good idea, and we received many calls of support,'' said M. Barry Schneider, board chairman. ''However, people who live near the landings have serious concerns about the impact on their neighborhoods.''</p>
        <p>The project, estimated at $10.7 million and due to be completed in late 2002, is a joint undertaking by the city and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. The plan is to establish new piers and refurbish existing ones with concession stands, ticket kiosks and waiting areas. Sites have already been selected at East 62nd, 75th and 90th Streets.</p>
        <p>Ferry service, which would probably be provided by New York Waterway, would connect the landings with one another other and with La Guardia Airport and other destinations. There is currently service from East 90th Street to Shea and Yankee Stadiums during baseball season.</p>
        <p>People who live near the landings are concerned about increased street traffic from pedestrians, taxis and buses, especially during peak hours when boats would arrive and depart every 15 minutes. They are also worried about loudspeakers, bright lights and security issues that might arise if rowdy crowds headed for ballgames.</p>
        <p>At East 75th Street, for example, where a new landing would be built, there is no direct access from the esplanade above. ''People will have to drive or walk to 78th Street, where there's a ramp to the water,'' said Betty Cooper Wallerstein, president of the East 79th Street Neighborhood Association. ''It will be a serious intrusion into a park, a historic district and a narrow little one-way street where children play.''</p>
        <p>The most vocal opposition came from people who live near the East 90th Street site. The landing would be near Asphalt Green and Carl Schurz Park, and residents worry that buses, crowds and concessions would change the character of the area.</p>
        <p>''If I wanted to live next to such a carnival atmosphere, I would have moved to Coney Island,'' said Roberta Greebel Zuckerman, a resident. ''And for much less.''</p>
        <p>The parks commissioner, Henry J.  Stern, dismissed the community's objections.</p>
        <p>''These complaints are nothing from nothing, because the impact will be so minimal,'' he said in an interview. ''And if we use our waterways more intelligently, we might relieve some of that F.D.R. traffic that people always complain about.''</p>

        <p>NEIGHBORHOOD REPORT: EAST SIDE  Correction:  June 4, 2000, Sunday  An article in the Neighborhood Report pages on May 14 about opposition to ferry landings along the East River quoted incorrectly from a comment by an opponent, Roberta Greebel Zuckerman. She said, ''If I wanted to live across from a recreation area, I would have moved to Coney Island,'' not ''If I wanted to live next to such a carnival atmosphere.''</p>
