        <p>BECAUSE OF WINN-DIXIE</p>
        <p>By Kate DiCamillo.</p>
        <p>Candlewick, $15.99. (Ages 8 to 12)</p>
        <p>Opal Buloni (''Sometimes the kids . . . called me 'Lunch Meat' '') is 10 years old and desperately needs a break. For as long as she can remember, she and her repressed but kindly preacher dad have lived in northern Florida. But his new job at the Open Arms Baptist Church in the tiny, and unfriendly, south Florida town of Naomi has forced Opal to leave behind everything she knows, including all her friends.</p>
        <p>When she claims a stray dog in the local Winn-Dixie grocery store, her luck begins to turn. Because ''it's hard not to immediately fall in love with a dog with a good sense of humor,'' she calls him Winn-Dixie and risks her dad's anger by bringing him home to the Friendly Corners Trailer Park. Gradually Opal's relationship with Winn-Dixie restores her confidence, and for the first time she bargains with her dad to tell her more about her long-missing mom: ''Since I'm 10 years old, you should tell me 10 things about my mama. Just 10 things. That's all.''</p>
        <p>Because Winn-Dixie ''couldn't stand to be left alone,'' he and Opal are as inseparable as a lonely child and an abandoned dog can be. The world (of Naomi) becomes their oyster, and they make new friends all over the place: Miss Franny Block, the librarian at the Herman W. Block Memorial Library and heir to the Littmus (Block) Lozenge fortune; guitar-playing Otis and his parrot Gertrude, proprietors of Gertrude's Pets; 5-year-old Sweetie Pie Thomas, who invites Opal to her first birthday party in Naomi; and Gloria Dump, the nearly blind town ''witch,'' who encourages Opal to ''go on and tell me everything about yourself, so as I can see you with my heart.'' When Opal proclaims that ''just about everything that happened to me that summer happened because of Winn-Dixie,'' she is speaking the truth. The healing power of canine love has revived her ability to come to terms with the ''sorrow-filled world'' and to reach out to new experiences with eagerness and hope. ''Because of Winn-Dixie'' is a poignant and delicately told story of a dog as a child's much-needed best friend.</p>
