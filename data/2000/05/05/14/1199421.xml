        <p>Catherine Ip, a daughter of Wai Chuen Ip and Wai Sham Ip of New York, was married yesterday to Simon Garnet Smith, a son of Judith Ann Smith and Dr. Garnet Oliver Smith of Melbourne, Australia. The Rev. Krystin S. Granberg performed the ceremony at Brick Presbyterian Church in New York.</p>
        <p>The bride, 35, is chief administrative officer of Stockback, a New York company that is developing an Internet retailing site. She received a bachelor's degree in anthropology from Mount Holyoke College and an M.B.A. from New York University. Her father is a retired waiter and her mother is a retired seamstress, both in New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith, 34, is a vice president in investment banking at Merrill Lynch &amp; Company in Manhattan. He received a bachelor's degree in economics from Melbourne University and an M.B.A. from Columbia University. His mother is a retired physical therapist and his father is a retired surgeon, both in Melbourne.</p>
        <p>The couple met in October 1994 when both worked at PaineWebber, where they had flirted on the elevator. One day, they found themselves at the same deli and salad bar. ''I accused her of following me, even though I knew she hadn't,'' Mr. Smith said. Ms. Ip remembered that ''Simon had a great Australian accent.''</p>
        <p>They agreed to meet for drinks, which went well. They then agreed to meet at Mr. Smith's apartment, where a few days later he cooked dinner, which did not go as well. ''I like my chicken well done,'' he said. Ms. Ip recalled thinking that the chicken ''looked and tasted like a hockey puck.'' The zucchini was even worse, she said. At the end of the date, Ms. Ip recalled having a wonderful time talking to Mr. Smith. But, she said, ''I was very hungry, because I hadn't swallowed a thing.''</p>
        <p>The next month, Mr. Smith returned to Australia for a family wedding. He worried that the couple's budding romance might founder in the month that he was away, so he sent Ms. Ip a $120 bouquet of flowers. ''I knew it was impressive, because the florist thanked me for sending it,'' he said. Ms. Ip was impressed, too. ''I took a picture of it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, their romance did founder in May 1996, when Mr. Smith moved back to Australia to take a job. A year went by, and Mr. Smith finally told Ms. Ip that he had made a mistake. For nearly another year, the couple commuted, an imposing task.</p>
        <p>By November 1998, Mr. Smith got a New York job with Merrill Lynch and the couple moved in together. One day, Mr. Smith asked Ms. Ip to attend a dinner with clients. She arrived and was puzzled to find Mr. Smith on a street corner, with no clients in sight. ''Do you mind if I get some gum?'' Mr. Smith asked. And Ms. Ip became even more puzzled when he walked her into the deli where they had first talked, five years before.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ip froze when Mr. Smith dropped to one knee, gum in one hand and an engagement ring in the other. Ms. Ip glanced from side to side to gauge the reaction of other customers in the crowded deli. As Mr. Smith asked her to marry him, irritated New Yorkers stepped over him to get to the cash register.</p>
        <p>''I was delighted to marry Simon, but it wasn't at all like the movies,'' Ms. Ip said. ''Nobody in the deli applauded. And the deli owner made Simon pay for his gum.''</p>
