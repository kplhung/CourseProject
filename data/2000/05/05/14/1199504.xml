        <p>Rudy Giuliani's personal life is not yet as weird as Angelina Jolie's, but it's getting there.</p>
        <p>The mayor's meltdown has been fast and furious and sad.</p>
        <p>The man who never hesitated to shame others has been shamed. The righteous politician who saw the world in polarized black and white has dissolved in a puddle of grays. The Senate candidate who sent out a fund-raising letter two weeks ago warning that Hillary Clinton would ''destroy our traditional values'' has been caught, like so many other Republicans lately, with his values down.</p>
        <p>I know there are a lot of burning political questions here. But I want to put them aside for a moment, and ask a more human question: Why are men so beastly?</p>
        <p>The whole New York Senate race has been driven by the insatiable need of powerful men to be adored by women other than their wives.</p>
        <p>Hillary was propelled into the race after her husband was caught cavorting with a young office aide (in addition to admitting another liaison).</p>
        <p>Rudy may be propelled out of the race after his wife accused him of cavorting with a young office aide (in addition to admitting another liaison).</p>
        <p>So Bill humiliates Hillary and makes her sympathetic enough to run against Rudy. Then Rudy humiliates Donna. Then Donna humiliates Rudy and makes him too unsympathetic to run against Hillary.</p>
        <p>And Newt, the man who wanted to humiliate Bill with impeachment for having an affair with a young office worker, was at the same time humiliating his second wife, Marianne, with a young office worker.</p>
        <p>Last week, Mr. Gingrich and his soon-to-be third wife, Callista Bisek, 34, registered online for wedding booty, listing more than $14,000 in items, from a $298 Waterford decanter to a $2.50 chef's spoon.</p>
        <p>The new Republican definition of family values can be found at a Web site where ''Macy's celebrates the wedding of Callista Bisek and Newt Gingrich.'' Well-wishers can e-mail the happy couple. (Felicitations, you roly-poly hypocrite . . .)</p>
        <p>When Hillary, Donna and Marianne began using their marriages to powerful men as a platform for striking out on their own, they did not come home to husbands supportive of their new ventures. They came home to find their husbands curled up with a good office assistant.</p>
        <p>I asked a woman in New York politics who knows Mr. Giuliani well why  such a seeming straight arrow became a Lothario. Donna Hanover was his trophy wife, a pretty woman with a career, a good mother, a political asset.</p>
        <p>''He needed to be adored,'' my friend replied.</p>
        <p>''She used to look at him adoringly,'' I persisted.</p>
        <p>''Donna was more of an equal,'' my friend explained patiently. ''He needed to be adored by women who were more in awe of him.''</p>
        <p>Rudy has always been a charismatic, drink-the-Kool-Aid sort of a leader. You're either with him or you're gone. And many are gone.</p>
        <p>Women have spent decades striving to be equal. And men, as we've learned from the cascading sex scandals in D.C. and New York, still have a hard time with equal.</p>
        <p>The tabloids have been digging up pictures showing the mayor's new girlfriend, Judi Nathan, walking five paces behind him at the St. Patrick's Day parade and on New Year's Eve. Rudy actually looks happy walking as Eastern potentates do, consort trailing respectfully behind.</p>
        <p>Women have always feared that when they grow powerful, men lose interest. Male power, of course, is an aphrodisiac.</p>
        <p>As women command businesses and dot-coms, many men in the public eye seem to be reverting to a 50's fantasy.</p>
        <p>''It's a geisha syndrome,'' said a Democratic strategist. ''These guys all want to come home, have their necks rubbed, have their slippers handed to them, and be told what big, virile men they are.''</p>
        <p>Some women who went to see last weekend's City Center production of the Bernstein, Comden and Green musical, ''Wonderful Town,'' found the retro lyrics of ''100 Easy Ways (to lose a man)'' disturbingly up-to-date:</p>
        <p>''A splendid way to lose a man.</p>
        <p>Just throw your knowledge in his face,</p>
        <p>He'll never try for second base.''</p>
