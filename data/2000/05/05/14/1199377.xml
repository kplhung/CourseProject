        <p>The outlook for access for the handicapped in the Village of Southampton is not as rosy as your article [''Southampton is Can-Do Town in Handicapped Accessibility,'' April 30] makes it out to be. The village has been and still is in violation of many Americans With Disabilities Act requirements. We have been working with village officials since early 1997 in an effort to bring them into compliance with these requirements. To date there have been many promises and some success, but there are still a number of issues to be resolved. We intend to be here until this is accomplished.</p>
