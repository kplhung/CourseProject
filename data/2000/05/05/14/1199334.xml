        <p>THE Cherney house here looks like the embodiment of the American dream: a neat white Colonial with dark green shutters, a pink front door, even an exuberant springer spaniel  that bounds up to greet visitors. Inside, Lee Cherney, who works for a real estate investment company, and his wife, Cheryl, are friendly people who clearly adore their daughters, Meredith, 8, and Emily, 2.</p>
        <p>So it is no surprise that Ivana Wise, a 10-year-old from Brooklyn, can't wait for her fifth summer vacation at the Cherneys'.</p>
        <p>Ivana has been visiting the family for two weeks every July since 1996, thanks to the Fresh Air Fund, a 123-year-old nonprofit agency that provides free summer vacations for disadvantaged New York City children.</p>
        <p>The children, who are chosen on the basis of need, range from 6 to 12, although those invited back to the same family may continue until 18. Families are host to them for two weeks or, in some cases, longer. There are no financial requirements for being a host family, nor is there monetary reimbursement. As Fresh Air Fund literature says, ''Most hosts simply want to share their homes with inner-city youngsters.''</p>
        <p>With that desire comes responsibility. The Cherneys are not so naive as to think that a change in scenery is sufficient to make a child happy; they know they need to treat Ivana as a respected family member.</p>
        <p>''When she is here, she is one of us,'' Ms. Cherney said. ''She does the fun things we do. She also helps with the chores. She gets an allowance, but we don't just hand out the money. We expect her to do things like help clear the dishes, and so on, just like one of our own children.''</p>
        <p>They are also keenly aware of the disparity between life on a manicured acre here and in a Brooklyn apartment on a rough street. Yet they do not believe, nor do they want their children to think, that money is the cure all.</p>
        <p>''My daughter Meredith said to me, 'It's nicer and greener up here, wouldn't Ivana just want to stay here and never go home?' I answered: 'No, absolutely not. Supposing we took you to visit a huge mansion where, say, Donald Trump lived, and we asked you where did you want to stay, at the mansion or come home with us. You wouldn't want to stay with Donald Trump just because he's rich; you'd want to go home to your own family because you love them, just like Ivana loves hers.' ''</p>
        <p>The Cherneys decided to invite a Fresh Air child into their home shortly after they moved from a town house to the house they are in now. Mrs. Cherney recalls that the volunteer chairwoman for central Westchester warned them about potential homesickness, sibling rivalry and the like.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Ivana, then 6, did get a case of the blues one night and began crying, ''I want my mommy.'' Meredith, 4 at the time, joined in ''just for the sake of crying,'' Mrs. Cherney said. She called the chairwoman and was told, ''Calm down, when you ask in the morning, 'Do you want to go home,' in all likelihood she'll say no.'' That is exactly what happened, and Ivana has been an eager participant ever since.</p>
        <p>The family swims in the municipal pool, has backyard barbecues and braves the rides at Playland. Ivana and Meredith also go to the town-run day camp, where Ivana has made friends of her own each summer.</p>
        <p>''It's like when you have a real sister,'' Meredith said. ''You don't hang out all the time with your real sister. We do a lot of things together, but she also makes her own friends.''</p>
        <p>As for Ivana, she is just as happy with the Cherneys as they are with her. ''I'm really looking forward to going back,'' she said. ''Meredith is like a sister.''</p>
        <p>Ivana's mother, Ann Dozier, couldn't be more pleased. A 31-year-old teacher's assistant at the Bank Street Head Start program in Manhattan, she initially had some trepidation.</p>
        <p>''I had wanted a different environment for my kids,'' she recalled. ''But at first I was scared. I had to pray over it. Then I met Cheryl. She made me so comfortable, I decided to take the chance. She took away a lot of my fears. It was like something you get to know from your heart, the way she was. We started off as Fresh Air acquaintances, but now we're more like family.''</p>
        <p>So rewarding has the experience been for Mrs. Cherney that last year she volunteered for the position of central Westchester chairwoman. She screens families and ''gives insights,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Host families may be couples with children, couples without children, single parents and childless single people. The important thing is that they be caring people. Those interested should call (800) 367-0003.</p>
        <p>Only one man among the people Mrs. Cherney interviewed last year displeased her. ''He said he had a nanny for his child and I was asking him about that nanny; he resented my questions and said, 'Look, if she's good enough for my own child, she's good enough for a Fresh Air child.' I didn't like that attitude at all.''</p>
        <p>The Fresh Air Fund primarily depends on individual contributions. Tax-deductible contributions may be sent to the Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018.</p>
