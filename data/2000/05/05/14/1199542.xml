        <p>In a striking gesture of support for public education, Gov. Gray Davis today proposed to exempt California public school teachers from the state's personal income tax, in what state officials said they believed was the first such peacetime exemption for any occupation in American history.</p>
        <p>State officials said the proposal, part of the governor's revised budget package to be announced on Monday, would amount to an income tax cut of $1,350 for the average experienced California teacher, who earns about $50,000 a year.</p>
        <p>The state has about 283,000 credentialed public school teachers, and the estimated annual cost of the program, which is subject to legislative approval, would initially be $545 million out of a total statewide budget of about $90 billion.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the governor proposed to spend another $500 million a year to reward teachers whose schools show improvements in student performance.</p>
        <p>Under this plan, teachers whose schools show an improvement rate of 20 percent or more based on the state's new academic performance index, which ranks schools according to standardized tests, would receive one-time bonuses of $5,000 each, while others would receive lesser amounts based on their schools' performances.</p>
        <p>That amounts to a form of merit pay that rewards collective achievement by an entire school, as opposed to individual teachers, which education unions generally oppose.</p>
        <p>''You know I value all work, whether you're a janitor, middle manager or a C.E.O., and I take a back seat to no one in my respect for people who put themselves in harm's way, such as firefighters, policemen, paramedics,'' Mr. Davis said in a conference call with reporters, when asked why he was singling out one profession.</p>
        <p>''But I really believe we have to make a simple declarative statement that above all else, teaching matters,'' he said. ''This is the single most important profession to us in the Year 2000 and that's the statement I'm making.''</p>
        <p>In New York, Gov. George E. Pataki and the Legislature recently agreed to create a program that would cover the cost of college tuition, up to $3,400 annually for four years, for students who agree to teach in schools with severe teacher shortages. The plan would also help the state's 11,500 uncertified teachers cover the costs of college courses to become fully licensed teachers.</p>
        <p>California has often been a trend-setter in tax policy, and Mr. Davis, who took office two years ago vowing to make education his ''first, second and third'' priority, has sometimes been mentioned as a potential Democratic vice-presidential contender.</p>
        <p>But as a fiscal conservative, cautious to a fault, he has also faced growing criticism for not moving swiftly enough in a booming economy to redress the severe educational problems in a state that once led the nation in per-pupil spending and investments in education but that since the tax revolt of Proposition 13 in 1978 has seen itself slip toward the bottom in numerous national rankings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis, the first Democrat to lead the state in 16 years, had faced pressure from fellow Democrats in Sacramento and especially sharp attacks from the state's largest teachers' union, which had threatened to sponsor a statewide ballot initiative this fall that would have required California to return its per-pupil spending, which has lagged in the bottom third of states in recent years, to the national average over the next five years. Mr. Davis has opposed that measure as requiring a costly tax increase.</p>
        <p>This week, the union agreed to drop the measure after the governor proposed an additional $1.8 billion in discretionary spending for education, intended to compensate for the lean years of the early 1990's, when teachers were forced to do without cost-of-living increases in wages to help close looming budget deficits.</p>
        <p>This year, with a projected budget surplus of $11 billion to $13 billion, the challenge has been how to spend the unexpected money.</p>
        <p>Senior Davis aides said the idea of the tax exemption, which would apply to fully credentialed teachers from kindergarten through 12th grade, arose at a brainstorming session in a staff retreat last week.</p>
        <p>''He's made a huge statement about the importance of teaching,'' said one senior adviser, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ''What are the Republicans going to say? They and the teachers are going to be hard pressed to oppose this.''</p>
        <p>In fact, legislative Republicans have said they believe there is room in the budget to spend perhaps an additional $3 billion on education, and while they may well be wary of anything that looks like special treatment for the teachers' unions, it seems likely that they would have trouble objecting to the symbolism of Mr. Davis's gesture, which was held in extraordinary secrecy by the governor's staff over the last week so as to make a maximum public splash.</p>
        <p>The State Senate Republican leader, Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga, said his members favored tax relief but believed it should be ''for all taxpayers in California, not just for one group.'' Mr. Brulte said he wanted to review the proposal before commenting further, but added, ''It'll make my kid brother happy: he's a teacher.''</p>
        <p>Barbara Kerr, the vice president of the California Teachers Association, the state's largest teachers' union, expressed pleasure at Mr. Davis's proposal.</p>
        <p>''It's an incredible package,'' Ms. Kerr said. ''It's a positive step, and I think it's going to help the kids of California. It shows teachers are valued, and it's awfully creative.''</p>
        <p>Davis aides said their research had shown various past tax exemptions for certain employee groups, but only in wartime.</p>
        <p>Under the Davis plan, public school teachers would be permitted to deduct 100 percent of their teaching income on state personal income tax returns. The estimated tax relief for a beginning teacher would be $500 a year, rising to $1,350 for experienced teachers.</p>
        <p>The tax break for teachers is just one element of Mr. Davis's proposals for doling out the budget surplus. Other plans include a $150 rebate for every income-tax payer to the state, and $300 for couples who file joint returns, at a total cost of $1.76 billion. Other measures include cutting state parks fees in half.</p>
        <p>Like other governors, Mr. Davis has offered a series of financial incentives to recruit and retain qualified public school teachers.</p>
        <p>This year, he proposed offering candidates who agree to teach in low-performing schools $10,000 loans for buying a home, $30,000 bonuses for attaining advanced certification and $11,000 to repay college loans.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Davis has generally resisted formally committing the state to returning its per-pupil spending, which is calculated by complex and sometimes disputed means involving a mix of state and federal money, to the national average. He contends that his latest proposals will take California's spending, which is estimated at $6,045 this year, very close to the national average by the time that average is next recalculated.</p>
        <p>Yet Davis aides acknowledged, for example, that there are bound to be disagreements about whether to count the teacher tax exemption toward the per-pupil spending figures, since it is an indirect expenditure of state funds.</p>
        <p>In his State of the State speech in January, Mr. Davis acknowledged that California must spend more to return its schools to the post-sputnik era achievements of former Gov. Edmund G. Brown.</p>
        <p>''But even more important, we must spend wisely,'' Mr. Davis said then. ''We cannot win this battle simply by throwing money at it. We must not let taxpayer dollars be wasted on bureaucracy, but, instead, we must invest them directly into the classroom: for students and for teachers.''</p>
