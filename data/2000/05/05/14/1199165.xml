        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In all the ferocious rush to quibble and take umbrage at imagined slights and misreadings in your frequently combative Letters department, I find it surprising and disappointing that not once (to the best of my knowledge) has one letter writer congratulated your artists and your art director on the funny and ingenious illustrations that consistently appear in your pages. The ability to capture the essence of a book in a single panel should not go unnoticed and unappreciated. Not a few of these insightful interpretations come across as equal or superior to the reviews they accompany. Case in point: Dusan Petricic's hidden ''CIA'' framing behind an innocent canvas in a museum display for the expose ''The Cultural Cold War'' (April 23). Definitely on the mark. Keep it up</p>
