        <p>Thomas P Lynch lettter on Andrew Sullivan's April 16 column holds it is likely his politically conservative dinner companions at party for Pat Robertson would have remained charming if he had revealed that he was gay but would deny him right to marry, adopt child and serve in military</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Andrew Sullivan (The Way We Live Now, April 16) wonders what many on the religious right would think about gay rights if they spent time with openly gay people. Yet he never gave his dinner companions that opportunity at Pat Robertson's 70th birthday gala. Of his own admission, he kept his homosexuality a secret that evening so he could ''watch the enemy at ease.'' Had Sullivan decided to make evident that he was gay, it is likely his dinner companions would have remained ''charming.'' Most people, after all, want to appear gracious. However, I can assure him that those same dinner companions will deny him the right to marry, adopt a child and serve his country.</p>
