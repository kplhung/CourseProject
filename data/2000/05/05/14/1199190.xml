        <p>WE live in a quaint, antebellum city in South Carolina where every six months or so, a TV crew from a travel or food show comes to town, sending the locals -- intensely private folk -- running for cover. And we often travel to New York, where there are street-side TV studios and, on every other block, it seems, a camera crew offering sightseers bit parts in a small-screen drama. All of New York City is a stage these days, and -- unlike our Carolina friends -- we think it's a whole lot of fun.</p>
        <p>But what's it like to be inside the studios, in a live television audience? We suspected that the most electrifying TV action was happening indoors, on windowless stages, with colorful sets and bright lights, so we drove to New York for a week of audience-hopping. And we found out that it's thrilling to watch -- live! -- when the Harvard student misses his chance to be a millionaire, but that it's even better to witness the unscripted moments the home viewers never see: the celebrity's off-camera candor and the all-important warm-up act, whose job it is to keep the audience on the edge of their seats, energized and responsive. In essence, each taping is a show within a show -- a two-ring circus where every seat is free.</p>

        <p>WE live in a quaint, antebellum city in South Carolina where every six months or so, a TV crew from a travel or food show comes to town, sending the locals -- intensely private folk -- running for cover. And we often travel to New York, where there are street-side TV studios and, on every other block, it seems, a camera crew offering sightseers bit parts in a small-screen drama. All of New York City is a stage these days, and -- unlike our Carolina friends -- we think it's a whole lot of fun.</p>
        <p>But what's it like to be inside the studios, in a live television audience? We suspected that the most electrifying TV action was happening indoors, on windowless stages, with colorful sets and bright lights, so we drove to New York for a week of audience-hopping. And we found out that it's thrilling to watch -- live! -- when the Harvard student misses his chance to be a millionaire, but that it's even better to witness the unscripted moments the home viewers never see: the celebrity's off-camera candor and the all-important warm-up act, whose job it is to keep the audience on the edge of their seats, energized and responsive. In essence, each taping is a show within a show -- a two-ring circus where every seat is free.</p>
        <p>Before heading indoors, though, we made a pilgrimage to NBC's ''Today,'' the easiest TV cameo in the city. ''Today'' created its current street-level studio in 1994 (ABC's ''Good Morning America'' and CBS's ''Early Show'' followed), giving passers-by a window on the action and an opportunity to say good morning to folks back home. One morning, at 7, we joined the jubilant crowd of more than a hundred tourists, including the senior class of an Appleton, Wis., high school, toting ''Hi, Dad and Mom'' signs and cups of coffee. Al Roker emerged from the building with a cameraman, and in a New York minute, we were all on the air, chanting, ''We love Al! We love Al! We love Al!''</p>
        <p>Once the show was over, production assistants from ''Maury,'' whose host is Maury Povich, roamed the crowd, offering guaranteed seats in the audience for the talk show if we'd step into one of the black stretch limos parked at the curb.</p>
        <p>No thanks, we said. We already had guaranteed seats for ''The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' -- one of the toughest tickets in the city -- in the General Electric Building, NBC New York headquarters at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, across the street from the ''Today'' studio.</p>
        <p>The lobby of the GE Building -- ''30 Rock,'' as it is called by those who work there -- is an Art Deco fantasy, a maze of flashy black and green marble, heroic murals, glinting brass doors. We felt as if we were on the set of ''Quiz Show,'' touring the hallowed halls of the dawn of television. A staff of clean-cut pages in blue blazers with NBC peacock lapel pins hustle audience members through the metal detectors and to their shows with a ''Howdy, folks'' good-cheer straight out of ''Leave It to Beaver.''</p>
        <p>''Are we ready to have fun?'' bellowed Joey Kola, the puckish warm-up comedian for Rosie O'Donnell. It was 10 a.m. and some audience members had been standing in line since sunrise for standby tickets.</p>
        <p>Others were still stunned by Mr. Kola's assurance that the plush toy, children's book, T-shirt, Ring Dings and small carton of milk on each seat were ours to keep. Our polite enthusiasm was barely enough to drown out the production assistant vacuuming the carpet around Ms. O'Donnell's desk.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kola pulled a face, all mock-offense.  ''LOUDER, PEOPLE -- ARE WE READY TO HAVE FUN?''</p>
        <p>We made more noise, and then more as Mr. Kola launched into a series of routines, throwing Koosh balls to the crowd, finding audience members from far-flung locales like Las Vegas and Vancouver, and introducing members of Ms. O'Donnell's house band, John McDaniel and the McDLT's, who were setting up and tuning their instruments. By the time Ms. O'Donnell came out, Mr. Kola had our row mates, Mike and Al, two full-grown adults, waving their hands and screaming for more Koosh balls; senior citizens were dancing in the aisles, and the McDLT's had the kids in the crowd singing the ''Jumpin' Jack Flash'' chorus.</p>
        <p>Ms. O'Donnell's entrance was anti climactic by comparison. But the show picked up speed once the cameras were rolling. Because it's generally broadcast live in New York and some other markets  and because the show packs in Ms. O'Donnell's monologue plus three or four guest appearances, things move along at a brisk clip, breaking only for commercials. That's when Ms. O'Donnell asks for questions from the audience. On the day we were there, in addition to questions she got an invitation to a wedding.</p>
        <p>One of Ms. O'Donnell's guests, a 10-year-old Miami girl, performed a suggestive dance routine that left the audience speechless, and Mr. Kola had to jump-start the audience's response. ''Applause'' signs flashed overhead.</p>
        <p>Three actors appeared, plugging new roles in TV and film. Blair Underwood and Ms. O'Donnell chatted about their children. There was David Arquette, in red patent leather loafers and a suit custom-made from 60's curtains, who had the audience atwitter, wondering whether the joke was on him, or on us.</p>
        <p>But Kyra Sedgwick got the most riotous laughter from the audience, for not knowing the ins and outs of the ABC hit ''Who Wants to be a Millionaire.'' Ms. O'Donnell had asked if Ms. Sedgwick might want to be in the ''hot seat'' on the celebrity edition of the show (Ms. O'Donnell was the first to sign up) to which the actress had replied, ''What's the hot seat?''</p>
        <p>We were a bit sympathetic. We weren't sure what the hot seat was, either, but we'd find out soon enough. ''Millionaire'' tapes in Manhattan, and we had a pair of VIP tickets.</p>
        <p>Even more intense than watching a quiz show on TV is being in the audience that determines a contestant's fate. In the chilly studio of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' on West 67th Street between Central Park West and Columbus Avenue, the first contestant, a Harvard junior, had the hot seat and was stumped by the statement: ''The African tsetse fly is famous for carrying the disease commonly known as . . .''</p>
        <p>Mr. Philbin had magnified the tension when he introduced the guy, asking him to recount a rumor that had circulated around Harvard the night before that he'd actually won the million dollars. He hadn't -- not yet. On the previous show, he'd answered eight questions correctly, without using any of his three ''lifelines,'' the opportunities contestants have to narrow down the choice of answers or seek advice from others. He was seven questions away from the big one. Alas, he didn't know the answer to the tsetse fly question and chose to use his first lifeline. He polled the audience for their response. The majority, including us, buzzed in answer C, ''Malaria,'' using the handheld controllers provided at each seat. And the Harvard guy chose to trust the audience's intelligence.</p>
        <p>Wrong! (The correct answer is sleeping sickness.)</p>
        <p>WE felt terrible for what we'd done to him, but there was no time for hurt feelings.  The cameras cut, and ''Q,'' the show's warm-up comedian, was out on the floor, offering T-shirts to anyone who could name a sitcom that he didn't know the theme song to. It wasn't a very high-stakes game, since Q didn't seem to know very many, so we spent much of the time during breaks watching the crew.</p>
        <p>The set is a spectacular arena-in-the-round that gave us ringside seats on the workings of a multicamera show. Unlike ''The Rosie O'Donnell Show,'' this one is not broadcast live, so there are extended breaks between segments to set up the camera shots for the next. A camera the size of a horse glided forward and back; another on a long boom swooped low over our heads. Roving cameramen and a still photographer prowl the set, too. The set's coolest feature, a circular, mirror-lined subfloor,  flashes light everywhere and gives the general impression of a U.F.O. landing pad. Overhead, the studio is a tangle of black wires, lights and pipes, as incomprehensible as a pawn shop's ceiling.</p>
        <p>Amid the dazzle of the production, the most memorable moments were those when we connected with the humanity behind the curtain, such as when Mr. Philbin's sparkly show biz smile turned frosty as soon as the cameras cut: ''I told you to give me a cue,'' he scolded a stage manager.</p>
        <p>We eavesdropped on a few crew members calculating their overtime, and on two cameramen zooming in on the pretty faces between takes:</p>
        <p>''Check that one out.''</p>
        <p>''The blue sweater?''</p>
        <p>''No, the one in the orange.''</p>
        <p>There was an bonus for everyone, once the show was over. The comedian Dana Carvey came out on to the set to tape a promotional spot for the celebrity ''Millionaire'' show in which Mr. Carvey, in a Regis Philbin wig and suit, claimed to be Mr. Philbin. Mr. Philbin had to prove he was the real one by getting in the hot seat and answering questions about himself. We thought it was hilarious the first time, but apparently Mr. Carvey had departed from the script, so we laughed again for the retake, and then again for the one after that.</p>
        <p>The entire taping was a marathon lasting from 4 until 7:45 -- not long enough, according to the Kentucky high-school group (who reaped the lion's share of Q's T-shirts), but too long for a small group of N.Y.U. freshmen who complained of sore limbs. The bleacher-style seats were, indeed, uncomfortable, like half-scale church pews, but we thought the experience was more than worth it.</p>
        <p>The most fun we had studio-hopping was at ''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart,'' Comedy Central's news show that sends up current events with a sense of humor that manages to be both wickedly mocking and self-effacing at the same time. Not surprisingly, the crowd was 20-something and dressed for a ball game.</p>
        <p>Inside the studio, one of the show's writers, Paul Michael Mercurio, in a baseball hat, was doing a warm-up act, ribbing selected members of the mostly local crowd (with expletive-laced patter; no one under 18 is admitted, for good reason). His mien turned deadly serious for a moment as he put us through our paces, rehearsing our fits of wildly enthusiastic, howling applause. By this point in the week, we were old hands at the ''clapping like an animal routine,'' as one audience member termed it. Mr. Mercurio then introduced us to Lewis Black, a regular ''Daily Show'' contributor and stand-up comedian who came out from behind stage and, off-camera, began a hilarious, spittle-launching tirade about small planes, inspired by a recent trip to Roanoke, Va.</p>
        <p>Jon Stewart came out and took a bow, and the taping began. He read a droll piece into the camera and we were encouraged to watch it on overhead monitors, since the crew blocked our view. In addition to Mr. Stewart's segments, a celebrity guest is usually part of the scenario. That day, however, Patrick Stewart, the actor, couldn't be there during the show, so we watched an interview taped earlier in the week. We also saw longer prerecorded pieces by a stable of roving reporters. In one, Vance DeGeneres (yes, Ellen's brother) interviewed a chainsmoking elderly man who's a crackpot candidate for president this year. Mr. DeGeneres's consummate straight-man delivery had us rolling in the aisles. It was all smart, funny material, briskly paced, and it was over before we knew it.</p>
        <p>There are few frills at ''The Daily Show'' -- no Ring Ding giveaways here -- but it was a short, high-energy New York TV event that was just what we were looking for. It  also fit perfectly between our afternoon trip to the Museum of Television and Radio and dinner at Joe Allen in the theater district, where we were actor-spotting. Alas, we didn't see anyone that night. But this week, at least, we'd seen more than our fair share.</p>
