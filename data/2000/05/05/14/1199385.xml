        <p>After considering sites in Connecticut, Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, the world's largest hotel chain, has decided to locate its corporate headquarters -- and eventually 600 employees -- in White Plains. It had been leasing temporary space at two spots in the county. Starwood will sublease about 203,000 square feet at 1129 Westchester Avenue from Nine West, a shoe and handbag manufacturer whose headquarters will remain at the complex. The county's Industrial Development Agency approved incentives worth $775,000 for Starwood over the 11 years of the sublease. Starwood, with more than 700 hotels, owns the St. Regis and the Westin, Sheraton and FourPoints chains.</p>
