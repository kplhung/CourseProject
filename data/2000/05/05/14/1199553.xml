        <p>After decades of caricature as the most self-indulgent and permissive generation in American history, baby boomers -- including Al Gore and George W. Bush -- are realizing it is time to get with the program.</p>
        <p>Despite their differences in political orientation, the two parties' presidential candidates, both of whom were born into the vanguard of the boomer generation, are delivering the same message on the campaign trail: ''responsibility.'' It is a message that goes to the personal and the political and speaks, the candidates hope, to a generation once famous for its idealism and its determination to do the right thing.</p>
        <p>Moreover, the campaigns have sensed a new wrinkle, so to speak, in the ever-scrutinized lives of the boomers that has emerged as they have aged -- the oldest boomers are now in the unusual position of contemplating their own retirements even as their parents are living longer and requiring more care. At the same time, some, like Mr. Gore, whose mother is 87 and whose mother-in-law lives with him and his wife, are even becoming grandparents.</p>
        <p>This nexus of life-defining events for the biggest cohort in American history (the 76 million people born between 1946 and 1964) has infused the presidential campaign with a new urgency, especially regarding Social Security and health care. Both  Mr. Bush and Mr. Gore have devoted much time on the campaign trail to Social Security and both plan to deliver major addresses on the topic on Monday.</p>
        <p>''It's a response to what's happening in society,'' said John Rother, director of legislation and public policy for AARP, one of the biggest and most effective lobbying groups in the country. ''It's driven by demographics, the economy and technology. There's a growing awareness, particularly of people who are Bush's and Gore's age, that their parent's generation is becoming frail, we don't have support systems that are in very good shape, and the anxiety about your own retirement is on the top of people's minds.''</p>
        <p>Al Gore was born March 31, 1948, making him 52. George W. Bush was born July 6, 1946, making him 53. And while they had different coming-of-age experiences during the 1960's and 1970's -- Mr. Gore was closer to the counterculture than was Mr. Bush, but still by no means a radical -- both are invoking their generational roots as themes in their campaigns and are developing ''responsibility'' as rationales for their candidacies.</p>
        <p>This campaign marks one of the few times that candidates from both parties have been so close in age. For the first two baby boomers are running for president, representing a definitive break with the World War II era. Given the unprecedented prosperity, these factors give the nation a chance to reset its compass and restructure its priorities.</p>
        <p>Here was Governor Bush in a recent interview with ''The News Hour'' on PBS:</p>
        <p>''I'm a strong candidate because I come from the baby boomer generation, recognizing that we've got to usher in an era of responsible behavior, which starts with behaving responsibly in the office.''</p>
        <p>Here was Vice President Gore at a fund-raiser Thursdayin Los Angeles, explaining the strong economy:</p>
        <p>''We got rid of the politics of illusion and said to the American people: 'We have got to make the real hard choices. We have to accept responsibility for our own future.' That's why it was so tough to pass the changes that have helped to unleash all this potential. Tough, tough, tough.''</p>
        <p>Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, says the invocation of responsibility is a harkening to fundamental values.</p>
        <p>''The notion that people ought to be responsible for their actions is one of the top-most widely shared values in this country,'' he said. ''So it's no surprise that politicians talk in that idiom.''</p>
        <p>But there is also a strong degree of self-interest in their appeals, particularly when it comes to issues like Social Security and Medicare. Politicians used to focus issues like Social Security and Medicare solely on the over-65 crowd. But now, Mr. Mellman noted, ''people are worried about taking care of their parents, and the leading edge of the baby boom are worried about their own retirement and some are worried about both at the same time, which is a newer phenomenon.''</p>
        <p>A political focus group of mostly middle-aged people conducted earlier this month in Bala Cynwyd, a suburb of Philadelphia, by Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster, found unanimity on one subject -- despite the prosperous economy, people are anxious about health care and Social Security.</p>
        <p>''As baby boomers get older, people start to feel it as well as think it,'' Frank Ratel, 60, an accountant, said during the focus group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rother of AARP said: ''The assumption among many people is that it's only seniors who care about Medicare and Social Security, but nothing could be further from the truth. Our polling shows it is boomers who are the most interested in prescription drug coverage because you're thinking about your mom and at the same time wondering about your own future. When you're in your 50's, you don't know what kind of shape you're going to be in. This is a greater concern of people in their 50's than it is for people 65 and older.''</p>
        <p>The crunch for baby boomers is becoming increasingly obvious. Almost 50 percent of the people who filed for bankruptcy in 1999 were baby boomers. Some academics, like Elizabeth Warren, a bankruptcy expert at Harvard Law School, argue that, contrary to the popular image of affluent boomers spending their way to consumer heaven, this is ''the most vulnerable generation'' because of the confluence of potential failures that they face, from the loss of a job to catastrophic illness to the effects of divorce and the need to care for aging parents.</p>
        <p>The likelihood of bankruptcy increases with age, as those facing retirement face mounting costs, particularly for prescription drugs and long-term care. Both Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush are offering proposals to help people meet these needs.</p>
        <p>The Social Security system has a surplus now, but the government predicts that the trust fund will begin paying out more than it takes in by 2015 as the baby boom generation retires. Without a major fix, the system could go broke by 2037.</p>
        <p>But for both candidates, the notion of ''responsibility'' goes beyond strengthening Social Security, which they would do by different means.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush emphasizes personal responsibility as a direct counterweight to what he perceives as the irresponsibility of President Clinton (the first baby boomer president). The goal of his candidacy, Mr. Bush says, is to restore honor and dignity to the White House.</p>
        <p>And the signal inherent in his message is an appeal to family values, long seen as Republican turf.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has emphasized the theme since he began his campaign last June, saying ''My first goal is to usher in the responsibility era -- an era that stands in stark contrast to the last few decades, where our culture has said: If it feels good, do it, and if you've got a problem, blame someone else.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has also used his emphasis on compassion to temper any impression that responsibility means harshness or sacrifice.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Gore, responsibility is a multipurpose concept, and he tends to use it both subliminally and overtly. He too is trying to distance himself from the actions of President Clinton. But he also wants to present himself as the logical successor to Mr. Clinton as the steward of the nation's current prosperity, and so he offers himself as the responsible heir apparent.</p>
        <p>This, of course, necessitates presenting Mr. Bush as the ''irresponsible'' alternative, a neat way, learned from President Clinton, of transforming a policy matter into a values judgment. Repeatedly, Mr. Gore casts Mr. Bush's proposals as ''reckless,'' a quality Mr. Gore conjures up with his relentless referencing to Mr. Bush's ''risky tax scheme.'' The contrast between the responsible Mr. Gore and the irresponsible Mr. Bush has fast become the organizing principle of the Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Bush, Mr. Gore is using the idea of responsibility to reinforce one of the basic tenets of his party. While Mr. Bush's reference summons family values, Mr. Gore's highlights the Democrats' traditional advantage on preserving entitlement programs. The ''risky tax scheme'' that he invokes is a direct threat to two tenets of Democratic orthodoxy -- Social Security and Medicare -- that baby boomers are now either depending on to help their parents or expecting to receive themselves.</p>
        <p>''It references the basic policy dilemma of his presidency,'' said  Elaine Kamark, Mr. Gore's chief domestic policy adviser. ''The challenge has gone from how to manage the insolvency of these programs to who can keep control of the surplus. The money guys on Wall Street understand this very well. They want confidence. You get it by running a straight, sound fiscal policy.''</p>
        <p>Because Mr. Gore had children relatively early for his generation, he is now a grandparent. ''His life cycle is slightly ahead of his generation, so he can see ahead to the centrality of some of these issues,'' Ms. Kamark said. Still, Mr. Gore is more a creature of the popular image of the baby boom than is Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush exudes a more retro 1950's youth, one of hijinks and drinking and frat parties, remarkably detached from the Vietnam War or any kind of rebellion or existential angst. As he told an interviewer for GQ: ''I don't remember any kind of heaviness ruining my time at Yale.''</p>
        <p>The vice president seems much more a product of his time. He invariably dangles his boomer credentials before his audiences, mentioning the touchstones of his generation -- the assassinations, the civil rights  movement, Vietnam, Watergate, his ''disillusionment with politics,'' though never rebellion, and his admission that he smoked marijuana.</p>
