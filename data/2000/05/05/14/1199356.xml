        <p>ON most Wednesday evenings in Point Pleasant Beach in the summer the beach is packed with spectators and there isn't a parking space available within miles of the boardwalk. As dusk approaches, musicians in black tuxedos or long skirts appear, violins, cellos, flutes and drums in hand.</p>
        <p>Like so many penguins attracted to the water, the members of the orchestra and chorus of the Orchestra of St. Peter's by the Sea make their way through the sand to a stage built on the beach. The occasion is one of the free performances of the symphony orchestra led by Father Alphonse Stephenson that have become a weekly summer tradition on the New Jersey shore.</p>
        <p>Each Wednesday -- this year the concerts run from June 28 through Aug. 30 with a special performance on Labor Day -- the orchestra presents the Festival of the Atlantic,  a melange of classical music, show tunes and popular songs. For the beachgoers in shorts, swimsuits and sandals, carrying beach chairs and blankets, the concert is just another part of the vacation experience, and it's free.</p>
        <p>''It is humbling and gratifying to see all of these people who come to the beach every Wednesday year after year to hear us,'' said Father Alphonse, who intersperses the songs with jokes and stories.</p>
        <p>The Orchestra of St. Peter's by the Sea may be one of the few professional symphony orchestras whose players are willing to risk getting sand in their instruments by playing on the beach, but it is a small part of the wide variety of music that is offered free of charge, or almost so, in shore communities each summer, attracting anywhere from a few dozen people to thousands.</p>
        <p>Down the coast is Lavallette, a tiny, quiet borough with one main street that blossoms in the summer to become a major tourist destination for families. In keeping with its sedate reputation, vacationers and residents can be found each Sunday evening near the gazebo in the borough park that overlooks the northern end of Barnegat Bay. From July 2 through Sept. 3 a band or orchestra  that could be drawn from any period from the 1930's to the 1970's serenades its listeners, said Joy Grosko, director of the Heritage Committee, which sponsors the concerts.</p>
        <p>The July 2 concert will feature a big band playing Sousa marches with a fireworks display timed to the music. For the 13th year, the summer concert series will culminate in a Heritage Day Festival the Saturday after Labor Day.</p>
        <p>At the other end of the spectrum  are the weekend-long musical extravaganzas in Red Bank that are tied to classic car exhibitions or food festivals. As many as 150,000 people have shown up for events like the Cruisin' with the Oldies weekend, which this year set for next weekend.</p>
        <p>The Red Bank Riverfest, which has been going on for 20 years, draws just as many people the first weekend in June to sample food from area restaurants and listen to jazz, blues, zydeco, bluegrass and rock 'n' roll with headline groups and regional acts alternating.</p>
        <p>Some of the beach areas that developed reputations over the years for attracting teenagers and young people use their free music programs to try to draw families to the resorts. Seaside Heights, in Ocean County, is one such community where live concerts alternate with family-style vaudeville acts every Thursday in the summer.</p>
        <p>Special concerts with contemporary popular acts can draw as many as 5,000 to the Seaside Heights boardwalk. The borough has been working for several years to add restaurants and other family attractions, much of it based on a New Orleans-style theme, said Michael Redpath, public relations director for the borough.</p>
        <p>The Wildwoods is another resort area that reaches out to families. The Doo Wop music festival and the Italian-American festival the first weekend in July are two events where free entertainment is offered. In mid-August the Mummers come to the island for a strutting contest, and the last weekend of August blues musicians and the Oktoberfest by the Sea hit the beach. A String Band Festival and Irish Fall Festival are planned for September to try to stretch the summer season a bit.</p>
        <p>Atlantic City may be the gambling center for the state, but it also has its share of summer music. Beach Fest on June 16, 17 and 18 is one of the larger free festivals along the coast.</p>
        <p>The event started as a boat race and is still sponsored by the Atlantic City Offshore Racing Association, although the boat race was eliminated as the music, food and games grew, said Debbie Johnson, administrative assistant for the association.</p>
        <p>''Last year we had three stages for music,'' Ms. Johnson said. ''This year we will have four with continuous music and a food court near each stage. There will be blues, country, rock 'n' roll, oldies and disco, as well as games and a parade.'' Latin music drawn from Central and South American countries and Spain will also be featured in Atlantic City during the 9th annual Latino Festival the weekend after Labor Day. There will be live music from noon to 9 p.m. Saturday and Sunday at Gardner's Basin, sponsored by the Hispanic Alliance of Atlantic County. The $6 admission charge for adults and $1 for children, which goes to the alliance, is kept low to attract families, said Flora Castillo, president of the festival.</p>
        <p>Tradition becomes a large part of the summer experience, and Brick Township in Ocean County has tapped into that with Summerfest, free concerts at Windward Beach on the Metedeconk River. The crowds have grown so large for some of the concerts and fireworks displays that the township has started running shuttle buses all evening from remote parking lots to the beach area.</p>
        <p>''People look forward each summer to coming to Winward Beach every Thursday to hear groups like Johnny Maestro and The Brooklyn Bridge,'' said Scott R. MacFadden, Brick's business administrator.</p>
        <p>Sometimes municipalities band together to present a summer concert series like the Carousel of Music 2000 coordinated by Ocean County. It includes 39 concerts in different locations in July and August.</p>
        <p>''It takes a lot of volunteers to put it together, but it's all free and people bring their chairs and sit outside and listen to the music,'' said Franklin V. Fischer, Ocean County surrogate, who helps coordinate the concerts.</p>
