        <p>A DECEPTIVELY bland-looking building here in this Bergen County suburb about 35 minutes from Midtown Manhattan could become one of the engine rooms of the Internet if the plans of its operators are realized.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most visible part of the Internet is the fast-growing companies with clever names and oscillating stock prices. And perhaps the least visible can be found behind locked and well-guarded doors.</p>
        <p>This is the world of the electronics boxes and powerful computers, known as ''big iron,'' that house the information available on the Net and provide two-way access to it.</p>
        <p>Officials of Infocrossing Inc. say they are combining operations of traditional data centers, which house and service computers for client companies, with the telecommunications hotels that have sprung up because competing companies find it convenient to be physically near each other.</p>
        <p>''This is where the Internet sits,'' Joseph Germanotta, the president of Infocrossing, said during a recent open house in Leonia, just across the George Washington Bridge.  ''Here is where the servers, the routers and the switches are.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, the interior of the building, much of it still vacant, has wire cages filled with electronic equipment, and a control room to monitor operations and fix problems as they arise. The Internet data center occupies 15,000 of the 30,000 square feet the company has leased in the building.</p>
        <p>Like the so-called ''telco hotels'' that have developed in Manhattan, notably at 111 Eighth Avenue and 75 Broad street, Infocrossing offers clients multiple choices of carriers and elaborate assurances that operations will be sustained on a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day-a-week basis.</p>
        <p>Data centers are similar to telecommunications companies from a real estate standpoint, said Paul Pariser, one of the principals in Taconic Partners, the owner of 111 Eighth Avenue.</p>
        <p>They require raised floors capable of bearing heavy loads and lots of electrical power and cooling capacity.</p>
        <p>But he said some tired old industrial buildings, particularly in other cities, are being marketed as telecommunications headquarters despite their limitations. ''You see derelict buildings in neglected areas,'' he said.</p>
        <p>William G. Cohen, an executive vice president of Newmark &amp; Company Real Estate, who is marketing 75 Broad Street, said the building is nearly full, largely with telecommunications companies. He said some of the companies there are adding data-center operations to their telecommunications businesses.</p>
        <p>The Leonia building is equipped with auxiliary generators and batteries to keep equipment running in case of a power failure or brownout.</p>
        <p>There is also a ''meet me'' room in the building where customers can connect to a number of carriers, including Bell Atlantic, MCI Worldcom, Level 3, Teligent and Winstar.</p>
        <p>Having multiple carriers, with high-capacity fiber lines on premises, means that carriers will have to compete with each other for the business of the dot-coms and other Internet companies that have their equipment in individual cages in the building, said John Stewart, Infocrossing's senior vice president for real estate.</p>
        <p>AND having the multiple carriers allows the company to build redundancy into the communications system, which is an important feature for companies that are literally out of business if communications equipment fails.</p>
        <p>''If a Bell Atlantic line is cut, we can transfer them to Level 3 to minimize the time of outage,'' Mr. Stewart said.</p>
        <p>Or, as Mr. Germanotta said, ''We have multiple on-ramps to the information superhighway.''</p>
        <p>Having the extensive telecommunications connections in the building means that a tenant company can increase its capacity quickly if its business takes off. ''We can provide the equivalent of one telephone line to thousands of telephones lines,'' Mr. Stewart said.</p>
        <p>Zack Lonstein, the chairman of Infocrossing, which was formerly named Computer Outsourcing Services Inc., said the company plans to build a network of 20 Internet data centers like the one here to participate in the growth of online businesses.</p>
        <p>The company, which is publicly traded on Nasdaq, recently received an investment of $60 million from an affiliate of Deutsche Bank and from Sandler Capital Management, which specializes in communications investments, to build the network of centers.</p>
        <p>The service the company offers is to take over what amounts to Internet companies'  technological back offices and to keep the systems up and running, allowing the clients to concentrate on building their businesses.  Infocrossing gets paid for the use of its space and services, but Infocrossing and concerns like it contend that grouping the equipment of many companies in one place and sharing services lower costs for the individual Internet businesses.</p>
        <p>It cites a study by Sun Trust Equitable Securities Research, which found that a simple Web site would cost $42,500 to set up and $12,400 a month to operate it if an Internet company did so alone.</p>
        <p>But since a service center already has  battery backup, firewalls to protect data from outside intrusion and technical support in place, the study said that using a service center would spread start-up costs across many clients and would reduce the monthly costs to $2,000 to $3,000.</p>
        <p>In addition to telecommunications capacity and technical competence, there is a lot of emphasis at Infocrossing's building on physical security. Guards are stationed at the entrances around the clock and escort visitors to their destinations. The windows are even covered by metal-mesh screens.</p>
        <p>Security is important, particularly for companies that handle sensitive personal financial information, said Mark Zona, the chief technical officer for the Market Technologies Corporation of Wilton, Conn.</p>
        <p>Market Technologies, which handles credit screenings on individuals for insurance companies and other financial institutions, has six very large computers known as servers at Infocrossing.</p>
        <p>''We had to be able to pass an audit by credit bureaus,'' Mr. Zona said. ''Our business hinged on passing that audit because otherwise they would not give us data.''</p>
        <p>He said the biggest concern for people in his line of work is the potential for identity theft: the thief learns enough about somebody else to pose as that person and run up debts under the assumed name.</p>
        <p>Physical security is important, of course. ''Data is data,'' he said. ''If someone could pick up the tapes from a drive, they could take thousands of identities.''</p>
        <p>ELECTRONIC security is also important. Mr. Zona said that executives at Infocrossing arranged for a secure telecommunications link between the machines in New Jersey and Market Technologies' home office in Connecticut to keep anyone else from gaining access to the company's data.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stewart, Infocrossing's vice president for real estate, said the company decided to open its first Internet center in Leonia because it was the corporate headquarters, even though Leonia is not close to the main fiber corridors in the area.</p>
        <p>''This is an 'out of the box' location,'' he said. ''We had to make a commitment to the fiber providers to bring fiber to this site.'' He said it cost the telecommunications companies $250 to $300 a foot to install high-capacity fiber lines.</p>
        <p>''In other cities we are going to look for buildings that are located along fiber routes,'' he said.</p>
