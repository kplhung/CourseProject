        <p>THE three-story Tudor on tree-graced Maryland Road in Douglaston, Queens, often reverberates with the clamor and clatter of Frances Toner's dozen grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.</p>
        <p>''And I have friends on the block,'' said Mrs. Toner, who has lived in her four-bedroom house for nearly 60 years, ''which is why I don't want to move.''</p>
        <p>In February, precisely because she decided to remain in the big, old house her father bought for $10,000 in 1943 -- and is now worth ''at least $350,000,'' she said -- Mrs. Toner made what in legal parlance is called ''a gifting.''</p>
        <p>''I've given the house to my children,'' Mrs. Toner, 83, said, ''but I can live in it until I die -- who knows when? -- or if I go into a nursing home. I assume all the responsibilities for repairs and taxes and insurance. It's all done in case I need Medicaid. If I have to go into a nursing home it would not be considered my property.''</p>
        <p>In many facets of her life, Mrs. Toner, a retired schoolteacher, reflects the range of choices, the possibilities and pitfalls, that older people, along with their offspring, must be aware of -- and sometimes be wary of -- in negotiating the added complexities of real estate that come with age.</p>
        <p>Stay or sell? Move in with the children or stick by those dear friends? Downsize in the suburbs or go co-op in the city? Head toward warmer climes? Buy or rent?</p>
        <p>Take on new debt? If so, how does one evade the clutches of predatory lenders? And just what are those newfangled reverse mortgages?</p>
        <p>Those are among the questions typically confronting the healthy elderly.</p>
        <p>If health declines, other complicated issues arise: If mobility abates, is the right course to remodel the old house and hire a home-care aide, or to move into some sort of assisted-living accommodation? What if one spouse needs assistance while the other does not?</p>
        <p>And how does one keep the government from ''taking the house,'' a common fear of the elderly, when Medicaid requires that most assets be liquidated? Or keep the tax collector from clobbering the children on capital gains?</p>
        <p>Such issues, to be sure, confront many people venturing into a real estate transaction, not only the elderly. But they are of particular concern to those who are likely to have lived in their homes for decades, may be on fixed incomes, and may not be familiar with the vicissitudes of the current market.</p>
        <p>They are issues for increasing numbers of Americans.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, one thing relevant about seniors is that there is going to be more of us,'' said Nicolas Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University.</p>
        <p>Today, Professor Retsinas said, 34 million Americans are 65 or older; in 1970, it was 20 million.</p>
        <p>''And even more spectacular,'' he said, ''is that the growth will surge to almost 70 million by 2030.''</p>
        <p>In February, the Harvard center released a two-year study, ''Housing America's Seniors,'' which, among other conclusions, reported that people 65 and over, with ownership rates of nearly 80 percent, currently account for about one-quarter of all home owners, and 1 in 10 home buyers. ''One misconception about the elderly is that most of them live in age-restricted housing,'' Professor Retsinas said. ''The reality is that most live in the same kinds of homes everybody else does.'' Ten percent of the elderly live in age-restricted communities, the Harvard report says.</p>
        <p>Given that, as the population ages, ''we're not going to be immune from health and mobility problems,'' Professor Retsinas said, ''decisions about buying and selling homes are something more and more of the elderly will face.''</p>
        <p>Among the concerns raised in the report are that elderly people are increasingly living in suburban, auto-dependent areas; that they have had fewer children and, therefore, now have fewer primary caretakers than previous generations had, and that access to services will prove increasingly difficult for them.</p>
        <p>''The challenge in the marketplace is that while seniors are often not as well informed about their options, they increasingly need homes that are modified to accommodate mobility restrictions,'' Professor Retsinas said, ''and because of that they are more susceptible to predatory lending.'' At the same time, he said, ''as tomorrow's seniors face choices of whether to stay or move, they may not be as aware of revolutionary changes in housing finance that have opened up an array of options.''</p>
        <p>The Reverse Mortgage  Unlocking Values In Home Equity</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most revolutionary development in the field of housing finance for the elderly is the reverse mortgage, which offers a range of possibilities for homeowners 62 or older, particularly those who are equity rich but cash poor.</p>
        <p>By tapping into the long-accumulated equity of their home, elderly people can remain in their residences while financing a major remodeling -- perhaps installing wider doors for wheelchairs, access ramps and grab bars. Or they can buy a new home and no longer be fettered to monthly mortgage payments. Or take a lump sum at the time the reverse mortgage is closed and use that money for any personal project, or to pay medical expenses. Or they can simply enhance their incomes with monthly payments into their pockets or by drawing down a line of credit as needed.</p>
        <p>''They can really use it for anything,'' said Naomi Bayer, director of the New York office of Fannie Mae, the federally chartered home-financing corporation.</p>
        <p>Reverse mortgages, which have been on the market for less than a decade, require no repayment while the elderly person is living in the house. ''When they no longer occupy the home, the loan is due and payable with all the accrued interest,'' Ms. Bayer said. ''And any heirs may repay it by either selling the home or with other funds.''</p>
        <p>If, for example, a 75-year-old homeowner whose house is worth $200,000 takes out a reverse mortgage at an interest rate of 10 percent and lives in the house for 10 more years, the borrower could have access to a line of credit of about $100,000. The borrower could either draw down that line of credit at will or take monthly payments of about $900.</p>
        <p>If, at the end of the 10 years the full line of credit has been used up, a total of about $200,000 would be owed -- including the $100,000 the borrower received over the years, the closing costs of $10,000 and accrued interest of about $90,000.</p>
        <p>''Reverse mortgages are structured so that the borrower will never owe more than the value of their home at the time the house is ultimately sold,'' Ms. Bayer said.</p>
        <p>The scenario differs, somewhat, when a reverse mortgage is used to buy a new home. ''Let's say they are 73 and sell their home for $200,000,'' Ms. Bayer said, ''and they want to move closer to their children and buy a smaller home for $150,000. They could get what we call a Home Keeper loan in the amount of $65,000, and would contribute $85,000 from the proceeds of the previous sale'' -- leaving $115,000 in liquid assets.</p>
        <p>''If they are using it to buy another home, they don't get money for their current use,'' Ms. Bayer said, ''but it allows them to buy the new home without monthly mortgage payments. And when they die or move into other accommodations, the loan and the interest become due and payable.''</p>
        <p>Buyers should learn as much as possible about reverse mortgages before making a decision, Ms. Bayer said. ''There are counseling agencies approved by Fannie Mae that can provide individualized information,'' she said.</p>
        <p>They should decide themselves whether to take a reverse mortgage. ''Get advice from family members, but don't let anyone make up your mind,'' Ms. Bayer said. Borrowers should also insist that all reverse mortgage funds be paid directly to them, she said; ''don't let anybody persuade you to sign over the funds.''</p>
        <p>And borrowers should choose themselves how to use the loan funds. ''Sometimes seniors hear about reverse mortgages that offer a particular product or service, like home remodeling or an annuity,'' Ms. Bayer said. ''That decision is totally up to them.''</p>
        <p>Predatory Lending</p>
        <p>Targeting The Unsophisticated</p>
        <p>Some of these loan products are foisted on people by unscrupulous lenders.</p>
        <p>The basic pattern, said Josh Zinner, coordinator of the foreclosure prevention project for the elderly at South Brooklyn Legal Services, ''is that people who are financially unsophisticated are targeted.''</p>
        <p>In most cases, a contractor comes to the door ''making all sorts of promises about helping with affordable repairs,'' Mr. Zinner said, ''and people end up with vastly inflated home-improvement contracts, often for repairs that are not needed.'' The contractors work in conjunction with mortgage brokers who refer the loan to high-rate lenders. ''And then all sorts of fees and costs are piled on,'' Mr. Zinner said.</p>
        <p>People are sometimes persuaded to consolidate other debt into the principal of the mortgage so that it, too, is tied to their home. ''If somebody had credit-card debt or a hospital bill, it's all replaced by the high-rate mortgage,'' Mr. Zinner said. ''So people end up with huge monthly payments they can't afford.''</p>
        <p>''You can't lose your home because of an unpaid hospital bill,'' he said, ''but if you can't pay the mortgage because the hospital bill was added in, you can lose your home.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes, to push the loan through and collect their fees, mortgage brokers falsify income information on the loan application, ''and the lenders who work with these brokers simply look the other way,'' Mr. Zinner said. ''What results is a very high rate of foreclosures with these types of loans.''</p>
        <p>Borrowers sometimes commit to a series of predatory loans, Mr. Zinner said, ''until all the equity in their home is swallowed up.''</p>
        <p>In 1986, Louise Nathan, 61, was the victim of a hammer attack in her East New York, Brooklyn, home. She underwent years of therapy to regain some ability to speak, read and write.</p>
        <p>That elicited no sympathy from three successive lenders who came to the door of her three-story, aluminum-sided row house four years ago. ''The first was a typical home-improvement scam,'' said Nancy Slahetka, a staff lawyer with the foreclosure prevention project.</p>
        <p>The contract -- to install a new floor, a ceiling, a bathtub, cabinets, and repair a faucet in the bathroom -- was for $34,900. But the mortgage was for $60,000, with monthly payments of $711. Ms. Nathan's monthly income, from Social Security, is $948, Ms. Slahetka said.</p>
        <p>''The broker got a $13,690 fee,'' Ms. Slahetka said. ''They paid off her old mortgage, which only had $6,828 left and would have matured in 2001.''</p>
        <p>Less than a month later, the first loan was ''flipped,'' Ms. Slahetka said, ''when the same broker got her to sign another loan, for $75,000 at 10.95 percent. And there's a balloon payment of $63,000 after 15 years.'' A balloon payment means that until that point the borrower has, essentially, only paid interest on the loan, and not the principal. For Ms. Nathan's second mortgage, the broker got $4,100 in fees and commissions.</p>
        <p>And then came a third mortgage with a different broker, for $28,563 at 12.59 percent. ''She says that when she signed the papers she could hardly read and talk,'' Ms. Slahetka said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Nathan said: ''They wanted to do things to the house they said I wanted done. I feel bad about what it's doing to me.''</p>
        <p>Legal Services is currently seeking to devise a workout plan for Ms. Nathan's debt problems and, citing possible deceptive lending practices, challenging foreclosure proceedings filed against her.</p>
        <p>The Real Deal  Some Rules For Success</p>
        <p>Most real estate transactions are perfectly legitimate, which is not to say that every party to the deal is not trying to maximize profits. So Dominick Pompeo, who knows what houses should cost, offers some basic advice -- good for buyers or sellers of all ages but, particularly, for the elderly.</p>
        <p>''Many times,'' said Mr. Pompeo, a former chairman of the New York State Appraisal Board and the president of Diversified Valuation Group, an appraisal company in South Ozone Park, Queens, ''older folks purchased their homes or apartments 30, 40 years ago and are not really up on current market conditions. There's the chance they will go to a broker who is not as experienced in their particular community as he or she should be.''</p>
        <p>Rule No. 1 -- go to a well-established local broker.</p>
        <p>''In addition,'' Mr. Pompeo said, ''if they should relocate to a new community, our first advice is that they rent for a time, to see if it suits their needs.''</p>
        <p>In that instance, because potential buyers are unfamiliar with the local market, Mr. Pompeo recommends that they have an appraisal done. But only by an appraiser who is certified or licensed by the state and, again, can demonstrate experience in the community.</p>
        <p>''You can get burned choosing an appraiser,'' Mr. Pompeo said. ''They can be unscrupulous, biased, if they are retained by the mortgage broker or the sales broker. Those individuals do not realize their remuneration unless the deal is consummated, so they may look for an appraiser who is willing to make sure the number comes in at the contract value.''</p>
        <p>In the past, most appraisers were retained directly by lenders. But now, with streamlined, computerized mortgage programs, brokers are retaining them. ''And if the appraiser does not insure that the deal is done they are not hired again,'' Mr. Pompeo said.</p>
        <p>When the elderly relocate, he said, ''they take their knowledge and parameters about their own market and judge their new area by their previous standards.''</p>
        <p>''And if they are coming from somewhere in the Northeast, where prices tend to be higher,'' he continued, ''there's a possibility they may pay more than the market commands and still think they are getting a good deal.''</p>
        <p>''If they are coming to this area,'' Mr. Pompeo said, ''they may get sticker shock.''</p>
        <p>Particularly shocking, said Sylvia Shapiro, is buying an apartment in Manhattan. Ms. Shapiro, a real estate lawyer and author of ''The Co-op Bible'' (St. Martin's Griffin, 1998), said, for example, that since her building converted in 1991, a one-bedroom has jumped from about $130,000 to $360,000.</p>
        <p>There are several things a potential co-op or condominium buyer should watch for. ''These pertain to most buyers, but are of greater concern to people on a fixed income,'' Ms. Shapiro said.</p>
        <p>The buyer should be sure the building ''has a history of fairly constant maintenance and monthly charges, not huge spikes like the Dow Jones,'' she said, and should find out if the underlying mortgage is coming due. If the board has to refinance, Ms. Shapiro said, ''that could result in a substantial maintenance increase and put a crimp in a retiree's budget.''</p>
        <p>A building's ''personality,'' Ms. Shapiro said, should also be considered by an elderly buyer. ''There's one building in my neighborhood where I think you need an A.A.R.P. card to gain admission,'' she said. ''Different generations often have different agendas. Depending on who holds the upper hand, these differences can lead to skirmishes before the board.''</p>
        <p>These days, with bidders outnumbering available apartments in Manhattan, boards are being finicky in vetting an elderly buyer's finances, particularly if someone is on a fixed income and may not be able to afford additional monthly charges.</p>
        <p>James E. Baker, a retired State Department foreign service officer who, tongue slightly in cheek, described himself as ''ancient, over the hill, falling apart,'' confronted that kind of skittishness when he bought a one-bedroom in a co-op on East Ninth Street.</p>
        <p>''I had rented for 23 years, a fourth-floor walkup,'' Mr. Baker, 65, said. ''But the aches and pains, it was too much.'' He was paying about $1,000 a month for the rent-stabilized apartment.</p>
        <p>''I went out to rent another place and found absolute dregs in my price range,'' Mr. Baker said. ''The worst was a one-room efficiency; you came through the door and on the right was a curtain with a john behind it, and on the left was a counter with a hot plate and one of those mini-refrigerators underneath. They wanted $1,750. I couldn't believe it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Baker's broker then said that if he could make a down payment he probably could buy an apartment and afford monthly charges within his $2,000 limit.</p>
        <p>''The only other intelligent thing I've done in my life is a buy a little house in Sag Harbor,'' Mr. Baker said. He paid $40,000 for that two-bedroom cottage in Southampton, and it is now worth, he estimates, $350,000.</p>
        <p>''I've got a pension from the State Department and Social Security, so my annual income without lifting a finger is $65,000,'' Mr. Baker said. He also has a $5,000-a-year adjunct professorship in United Nations studies at Long Island University. ''Not really the biggest slice of my pie, is it?'' he said.</p>
        <p>And yet, given the possibility of future maintenance increases, that job became a bit of an issue before the board of the East Ninth Street building.</p>
        <p>''There seemed to be concern about whether I would keep the job or not; they kept asking for records,'' Mr. Baker said. ''From my perspective, I have zero debt, a house fully paid for, a clean credit record for 35 years, blah, blah, blah.''</p>
        <p>''Anyway, it all worked out,'' he said.</p>
        <p>And, in early December, Mr. Baker made a $60,000 down payment on the $195,000 apartment. With mortgage payments of $800 and maintenance of $500, he said, ''That's manageable -- $1,300 for a clean apartment, with elevators.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Baker is single, and does not have to worry about his heirs. Others do.</p>
        <p>Estate Planning  Keeping the House, Minimizing Taxes</p>
        <p>Typically, when a husband and wife own a home and one spouse dies the home will automatically be owned by the surviving spouse, and no estate taxes will be assessed. When the second spouse dies, however, the value of the home will become part of the estate and could be subject to estate taxes.</p>
        <p>Under Federal estate laws, every individual has a credit of $675,000, which allows them to leave property valued up to that amount to their heirs without it being subject to estate taxes. That credit amount is scheduled to increase to $1 million in 2006.</p>
        <p>For many elderly people, however, the focus is not on what will happen after they die, but on preserving their ownership through the rest of what increasingly is a lengthening life span.</p>
        <p>''Older people,'' said Brian Treacy, an elder-law lawyer in Rutherford, N.J., ''often have this paranoia about the government; they don't want 'the government,' in quotes, 'to take my house.' ''</p>
        <p>It might be the hospital, a nursing home, the Internal Revenue Service, ''they all blur together,'' Mr. Treacy said, ''and seniors will go to great lengths to prevent 'them' from getting their property.''</p>
        <p>There are, of course, perfectly legal lengths to which anyone is entitled to go to protect their home for themselves, for a healthy spouse or for their heirs -- precisely what Mrs. Toner, in her stately Tudor home in Douglaston, Queens, had in mind when she opted to give the house to her children.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Toner is healthy; her husband, Hugh, 84, recently entered a nursing home. The ''gifting'' -- linked to what is called a life-estate clause -- gives her peace of mind, she said, ''a sense that I know it won't all go to the nursing home, that the children will have something.''</p>
        <p>''And they can't put me out,'' she said with a touch of glee.</p>
        <p>The papers were drawn up by Ronald Fatoullah, an elder-law lawyer in Nassau County's Great Neck. ''Once Mrs. Toner's husband was approved for Medicaid,'' Mr. Fatoullah said, ''we wanted to do estate planning for her. Now the home is protected for herself, should she ever need care, and for her children in the future.''</p>
        <p>Nursing-home costs can range from $80,000 to more than $130,000 a year, Mr. Fatoullah said, ''and if the home remains in the name of the senior who has received Medicaid benefits, the government would recoup dollar for dollar everything it spent.''</p>
        <p>''So if there was, let's say, $500,000 in Medicaid dollars spent -- and that's not atypical -- there likely would be no home left,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Treacy, the lawyer in Rutherford, pointed out that the idea of transferring a home to an adult child is a common and simple transaction for any lawyer to perform.</p>
        <p>''The problem,'' he said, ''is that because that transaction is so easy and incurs no expenses it is usually conducted without one very important sentence: a life-estate clause.''</p>
        <p>''It is, in it's entirety, 23 words -- 'The grantor reserves to himself a life estate in the subject property for his use and enjoyment for the entirety of his lifetime' -- that can mean a difference of thousands and thousands of dollars in taxes that will have to be paid by the children upon the house's eventual sale.''</p>
        <p>It is here that the burden of capital gains taxes comes into play.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fatoullah offered a for-instance: ''A client comes into my office and wants protection for the home, and one of the first questions I ask is, 'When did you buy the home and what did you pay?' The response I typically get is, 'Oh, we scrimped and saved and the house cost $10,000 back in the 40's; and we got such a big mortgage, for $8,000.' ''</p>
        <p>What elder-law and estate-planning lawyers want to determine, at that point, is the basis for capital gains taxes on the elder person's home, which is calculated by taking the purchase price and adding the cost of capital improvements (though not basic repairs) that have gone into the home.</p>
        <p>''Often, a senior will say, 'I just want to transfer my home to my children,' '' Mr. Fatoullah said. ''But that's a problem. When you do that you are also transferring, along with the home, the senior's low tax basis. Meaning that when the child goes to sell the home, let's say for $350,000 or $400,000, it could trigger a huge capital gains burden for the child -- the tax on the gain.''</p>
        <p>If, for example, someone bought their home for $10,000 back in the 1940's -- as Mrs. Toner's father did -- and $40,000 worth of capital improvements were made throughout the years, the tax basis would be $50,000. ''Which means that if the home is sold for $350,000, there's a gain of $300,000,'' Mr. Fatoullah said, ''and the child will be responsible for paying the capital gains tax, at varying percentages, when the home is sold.''</p>
        <p>But with a life-estate clause, upon the death of the parent the home would be reappraised, and the market value of the home at that time would be become the new tax basis.</p>
        <p>''So if that $10,000 home is valued at $300,000 when the parent dies and the child sells it for that amount,'' Mr. Fatoullah said, ''then there is absolutely no capital gains tax involved.''</p>
        <p>''Quite a difference,'' he said.</p>
