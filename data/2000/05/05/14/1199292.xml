        <p>A NEW label has been born on the North Fork.</p>
        <p>Since the mid-1990's, Lieb Vineyard has appeared, as a secondary element, on choice pinot blancs made by Palmer and Lenz. Next month, a '98 pinot blanc ($15) and a '97 merlot ($20), polished wines bearing the name Lieb Family Cellars, will be offered to stores and restaurants.</p>
        <p>The pinot blanc, bone-dry and crisp in the Alsace style, with pear-and-pineapple hints in the bouquet and flavor, tastes best, lightly cool, with food. The merlot (containing small amounts of cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc), with a delectable bouquet, concentrated fruit and a measure of grace, is decidedly Bordeaux-like.</p>
        <p>Like Finger Lakes farmers who realized in the 1970's that making their own signature wine was more lucrative and satisfying than selling their grapes to others, Mark and Kathy Lieb have taken the big step.</p>
        <p>''Lieb Family Cellars is going to produce only reserve wines,'' Mr. Lieb said. ''We intend to only handpick our fruit and produce only from the best lots of our wines. We will continue to increase production of the pinot blanc to a certain point, probably in the 1,500 case area. The merlot production will stabilize in the 1,000 case area.''</p>
        <p>Lieb Vineyard, as the grape-growing company will still be called, will sell to the bulk-wine market wine deemed unsuitable for Lieb Family Cellars products.</p>
        <p>In addition, about 750 cases of chardonnay and 500 of sparkling wine are to be made yearly, Mr. Lieb said. Lenz made vintage-dated pinot blanc sparkling wine for Lieb in 1993 and 1994, and in due course some 250 cases of each will be released.</p>
        <p>Lieb Family Cellars owns no winery and plans none. Its wines will be made by Russell Hearn, with whom Mr. Lieb and Bernard Sussman, a partner in Spectrum, are also partners in the Premier Wine Group, a separate company. This so-called custom-crush operation, under construction on Route 48 in Mattituck, is expected to be ready for this year's harvest.</p>
        <p>Its object is to make wine for local grape-growers and other wineries in the fast-expanding East End wine business whose capacities promise to be taxed by rising consumer demand.</p>
        <p>Deep pockets are needed in the wine business, and evidently Mr. Lieb has them. He is an investment banker and owner of a money management company, Spectrum Asset Management, in Stamford, Conn.</p>
        <p>In 1992, Mr. Lieb bought 20 acres on Oregon Road in Cutchogue, 13 of them planted to pinot blanc in 1983 and maintained by Sam McCullough, currently Lenz's vineyard manager.</p>
        <p>''We began an extensive campaign to enhance the soil content and upgrade the pruning process,'' Mr. Lieb said. ''A decision was made to eliminate all herbicide usage, and that remains in force today. We have noticed that the vine strength has significantly improved.</p>
        <p>''The age of the vines is clearly a benefit to the quality of the wines,'' he continued, ''as the mature vines give us a high quality of fruit to make a pinot blanc reserve.''</p>
        <p>Seven acres of merlot were planted in the original vineyard in 1993. The next year, 16 more adjacent acres were purchased. Thirteen now hold chardonnay vines, and three are planted to cabernet sauvignon and cabernet franc, which are earmarked for blending in the merlot. Last year, the Liebs bought an additional 14 acres nearby, and they are being planted as follows: four acres each of merlot and both cabernets, and, experimentally, one each of malbec and petit verdot. Ray Hines, Mrs. Lieb's brother, is vineyard manager.</p>
        <p>The pinot blanc was made at Macari by Mr. Hearn and Gilles Martin, then Macari's winemaker; the merlot was made at Palmer by Dan Kleck, and, when he left, it was moved to Macari and finished by Mr. Hearn.</p>
        <p>LONG ISLAND VINES  Correction:  May 21, 2000, Sunday  A headline last Sunday about the creation of Lieb Family Cellars, a Long Island wine label, misstated the operation's location. As noted in the article, it is on the North Fork, not the South Fork.</p>
