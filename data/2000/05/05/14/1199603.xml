        <p>1. BRIAN BOUCHER'S FIRST SPRING  So far, so good for Philadelphia's rookie goalie. But who knows about a first-year player -- especially in such a key position --until he has completed a full test? Because Boucher played only 35 games in the regular season, he was a relatively unknown asset even as the playoffs began with Philadelphia's elimination of Buffalo and Pittsburgh. The Devils have had almost a week off to study him on videotape, to read scouting reports and to listen to coaches. If he has a major weakness, this may be the round it is discovered and exploited.</p>

        <p>1. BRIAN BOUCHER'S FIRST SPRING  So far, so good for Philadelphia's rookie goalie. But who knows about a first-year player -- especially in such a key position --until he has completed a full test? Because Boucher played only 35 games in the regular season, he was a relatively unknown asset even as the playoffs began with Philadelphia's elimination of Buffalo and Pittsburgh. The Devils have had almost a week off to study him on videotape, to read scouting reports and to listen to coaches. If he has a major weakness, this may be the round it is discovered and exploited.</p>
        <p>2. DEVILS' FLOCK OF FORWARDS  When Colin Campbell was Rangers coach in 1997, he referred to New Jersey's ''interchangeable flock of forwards.'' Some took it as a knock, but he meant it as a compliment. The Devils have evolved since then. They have more variety than they used to have and more depth than the Flyers. Petr Sykora, Scott Gomez, Jason Arnott and Patrik Elias ignited the scoreboard against the Maple Leafs. Against the bigger and tougher Flyers, such big and tough Devils as Claude Lemieux, Bobby Holik and Randy McKay may have to provide more than the one goal they have accumulated thus far.</p>
        <p>3. PHILADELPHIA'S INJURY STORY  Billy Martin, the baseball manager, used to say that late rounds of any tournament in any sport are determined by injuries. If this is so, the Flyers are in trouble, particularly at center, the key skating position.</p>
        <p>Eric Lindros, out since March with concussions, is unlikely to return this round. Keith Primeau, acquired late in the season as his backup, suffered a frightening concussion in the final game with Pittsburgh and is doubtful at least for the opener. Daymond Langkow, another center, missed practice last week with what may be a groin injury. If Mark Recchi moves from right wing to center, the Flyers will be weakened on the flank.</p>
        <p>4. SOMETHING HAS TO GIVE ON SPECIAL TEAMS  In the playoffs, the Flyers have the best power play, with 13 goals on 52 chances, a success rate of 25 percent. In this same tournament, the Devils' penalty killers have given up 1 goal over 34 times short-handed, a success rate of 97.1 percent. The team that prevails in these situations could command the series.</p>
        <p>5. REST AND RECOVERY  The Devils were sensitive early in the season when everyone noticed that they had trouble winning the second game when they played on successive nights. Perhaps their veterans sensed the underlying suggestion. But this series between neighboring teams is ideally set up for any team, young or old. With exactly one off day between every game, the rhythm is perfect; no one gets too fatigued or stale. Travel grind is no problem, either, with the two rinks a bus ride away. Five of the seven games begin at 7 p.m. and today's starts at 3 p.m. This setup is good for the players and fan-friendly, too.</p>
