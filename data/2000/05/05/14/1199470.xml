        <p>Time was, in this region, Grandpa worked for Krupp, Dad worked for Krupp, and if Junior did not work for Krupp too, everyone was aghast. Here in the heartland of German heavy industry, the big companies took care of you, and employment was for life.</p>
        <p>Think again. The Ruhr industrial area -- coal, steel, belching chimneys, grinding machinery, polluted rivers, great heaving motor of German postwar reconstruction and economic might -- is no more. Many of the former pits and factories have been converted into museums of ''industrial culture'' where old compressors adorn chic cafes.</p>
        <p>In the place of the steel-and-coal men who made the Ruhrgebiet, or Ruhr Valley, an industrial legend, meet hard-driving Josef Brewing, 37. He heads a venture called Electronic Commerce Center, is given to talk of ''start-up incubators,'' and is busy turning a 100-acre site occupied in cold-war days by the British Rhine Army into a new-economy hub.</p>
        <p>''This will be the biggest agglomeration of e-commerce companies in Germany,'' said Mr. Brewing (pronounced BRER-wing). ''We opened the first building less than a year ago and already have 17 companies with 300 employees offering everything from Internet consulting to software development. Within three years, we expect about 3,000 people to work here.''</p>
        <p>Of course, it is not easy to turn Pittsburgh into Palo Alto, and it is impossible to do so overnight. But the revolution taking place in dowdy Dortmund reflects a broader one in Germany. The land of social-market consensus is giving way to a brasher place where young entrepreneurs are lionized as modernizing heroes.</p>
        <p>Turn on the TV and chances are some high-tech upstart like Gerhard Schmid of Mobilcom is explaining how he made millions. Stock market reports are increasingly ubiquitous, restaurant banter is often about bargain shares. Last year, the number of Germans owning stocks jumped 11 percent to more than five million; the trend is accelerating.</p>
        <p>''The wealthy don't have to hide in this country any more because they are no longer held up as examples of greed,'' said Michael Wolghat, an economist at Deutsche Bank. ''Germany is changing as shareholding spreads at a rapid rate. Students now seem less interested in politics than in price-earning ratios.''</p>
        <p>Nowhere is this transformation of Europe's biggest economy more dramatic than in the Ruhr, the most concentrated industrial area of the continent and the place where Marshall Fund money first ignited the postwar economic miracle.</p>
        <p>Problems began many years ago because Germany's coal cannot compete with South Africa's, which is cheaper to mine. In the last decade, 20 mines have closed. The unemployment rate, at 16 percent in Dortmund, is still well above the national average of 10 percent; the few vestiges of the coal industry are heavily subsidized and perhaps doomed. Still, a change of culture is palpable.</p>
        <p>Indeed, it is partly because he is widely seen as more capable of managing this reinvention of the Ruhr that Wolfgang Clement, the Social Democratic premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, is expected to defeat his Christian Democratic challenger, Jorgen Ruttgers, in a state election on Sunday. Mr. Ruttgers' anti-foreigner message has played poorly in a state more inclined to the pragmatism of Mr. Clement, whose approach has not yet undone the sweeping social damage of pit closures, but who has already suggested that the new economy can bring prosperity to the land of Krupp and Thyssen.</p>
        <p>One representative of this change is Rainer Rudolf, 38. He started his software and consulting company, Adesso, two years ago and has more work than he can handle. In striking contrast to the ''Herr Doktor'' formality of the traditional German workplace, his 72 employees sit around in T-shirts and open-necked shirts munching pizza.</p>
        <p>Adesso, based in the new Dortmund e-commerce center, is working a lot with insurance companies that want to sell car insurance and other policies over the Internet but have little idea how to do so.</p>
        <p>This activity reflects a crucial change in Germany during the last year: old-economy companies have understood they too must master new-economy techniques. ''We're swamped,'' Mr. Rudolf said.</p>
        <p>This is a country that takes a long time to move, but when it does, it  tends to do so with a single-minded determination and a somewhat startling speed. The blitzkrieg was a German invention. The current embrace of the Internet shows some of the same characteristics.</p>
        <p>''Until a year ago, e-commerce was widely regarded as just electronic shopping,'' Mr. Brewing said. ''But in the last year, people have understood that it's a way to rationalize your business and an essential route to new clients. The fact that we're the accelerators of the old economy has been grasped.''</p>
        <p>It took a while. The shift that has led to the emergence of companies like Adesso and Electronic Commerce Center had its germ in 1986 with the creation, backed by the local government, of a ''Technology Park'' next to Dortmund University. As coal and steel suffered, the plan was to ensure that inventions in the university could find expression in electronic and high-tech industries.</p>
        <p>The idea has proved fertile in the end: close to 25,000 people now work in software or microelectronic businesses in the Dortmund area. About one quarter of German venture capital is applied in the Ruhr.</p>
        <p>The largest company, Materna Information and Communications, a specialist in the software that provides short-message services over mobile phones, has about 1,000 employees. As for Thyssen and Krupp, they have merged into a slimmed-down modern company and embraced the sale of steel on the Internet.</p>
        <p>''The change is happening very fast today,'' said Kurt Monse, who helps coordinate the ''Media'' initiative of Mr. Clement, which provides financial support for the transformation of the Ruhr. ''We provide one-stop shopping for anyone, German or foreign, who wants to invest in our new Internet economy. What Mr. Ruttgers does not realize is that one investment by an Indian can provide 20 jobs for Germans.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ruttgers, the Christian Democratic candidate, has become notorious for the anti-immigrant electoral slogan ''Kinder Statt Inder'' -- ''Children not Indians'' -- that he has since withdrawn. It was badly received in his party, and he appeared to have misread the mood of an area that might be unhappy with its large number of foreigners but seemed to have reached a consensus that there was scant future in being closed to the world.</p>
        <p>''You've got all the public housing in Essen taken over by asylum-seekers, and you can't find a German on a building site,'' said Wilhelm Wetzel, a miner who retired at 50 when his pit was closed in 1988. ''It is not a good situation. But I don't see how we can reverse this situation any more than we can reopen the mines.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wetzel works as an occasional guide at what was once the area's largest mine, the Zollverein in Essen. The mine, which once employed 6,000 people, closed in 1986. Today, its functional, red-brick, Bauhaus-inspired buildings have been converted for a variety of uses, including concerts and jewelry workshops.</p>
        <p>There is a design museum, converted by the British architect Sir Norman Foster; a media institute; graphic studios; an art gallery; a museum of the mine; and a variety of small businesses. ''We even have guided tours ending with a glass of Champagne beneath the moon on the roof of the building where coal was washed,'' said Marie Mense, a coordinator of what is now called the Zollverein Foundation.</p>
        <p>From that roof, a fine view stretches away from the fabled  Ruhrgebiet, marked now by dormant chimneys and mounds of earth under which industrial waste lies. The Zollverein has become a prominent part of the ''Industriekultur'' road that takes visitors around disused plants, gas storage facilities and breweries,  now all museums.</p>
        <p>''We don't have wines or cheeses in the Ruhr, but we have a lot of industry, or rather ex-industry,'' said Eckhard Albrecht, the director of the Ruhrgebiet Initiative that has financed these transformations. ''This remains a central part of our culture, our traditions, even if the attitudes of Silicon Valley have now penetrated our world.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 16, 2000, Tuesday  An article on Sunday about changes in the economy of the Ruhr region in Germany misspelled the surname of an economist at Deutsche Bank who commented. He is Michael Wolgast, not Wolghat.</p>
