        <p>THE SETTING -- Yar, matey. More than 500 actors, set designers, volunteers and friends, many in pirate garb, crowded a costume ball at the Puck Building on Monday night to benefit the 52nd Street Project, a group that teaches children as young as 8 in Hell's Kitchen to write, direct and perform plays with professional theater people. After-school classes are held in the project's clubhouse on West 52nd Street, and the plays are performed at theaters in Manhattan. Monday night's entertainment included jerk chicken and a play performed by professional actors and students, followed by limbo dancing.</p>
        <p>THE BUZZ -- Isaac Mizrahi, his pirate bandanna clashing slightly with his gray suit, said at the predinner party: ''I just think it's a great cause. I love anything to do with kids. It's great fun.''</p>

        <p>THE SETTING -- Yar, matey. More than 500 actors, set designers, volunteers and friends, many in pirate garb, crowded a costume ball at the Puck Building on Monday night to benefit the 52nd Street Project, a group that teaches children as young as 8 in Hell's Kitchen to write, direct and perform plays with professional theater people. After-school classes are held in the project's clubhouse on West 52nd Street, and the plays are performed at theaters in Manhattan. Monday night's entertainment included jerk chicken and a play performed by professional actors and students, followed by limbo dancing.</p>
        <p>THE BUZZ -- Isaac Mizrahi, his pirate bandanna clashing slightly with his gray suit, said at the predinner party: ''I just think it's a great cause. I love anything to do with kids. It's great fun.''</p>
        <p>''There needs to be more fun parties,'' he added.</p>
        <p>While Kate McCamy engaged in an impromptu swordfight with a friend, her husband, Kevin Roach, the set designer for the 52nd Street Project, said he had designed a modular set adaptable for ''the moon, the bottom of the ocean'' and just about any other scene.</p>
        <p>''I've kind of designed myself out of a job,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Selena and Robert Evans, two friends of the theater project, came dressed for serious mayhem. ''She told me what I was wearing,'' said Mr. Evans, an educator who was having trouble with his eye patch and ruffled sleeves.</p>
        <p>Ms. Evans is a fashion designer  who apparently picked up her multicolored blouse from the House of Blackbeard. ''This is a total surprise to me,'' Mr. Evans said of his outfit. ''I'm just trying to see for the evening.''</p>
        <p>Maury Schott, a systems manager, was chatting with Howard Leifman, a human resources consultant. Their costumes were limited mostly to hooks: Mr. Schott's was plastic, Mr. Leifman's aluminum foil. ''Last week it was leftovers,'' Mr. Leifman said.</p>
        <p>The actress Frances McDormand, the chairwoman of the 52nd Street project (and a 1997 Oscar winner for  ''Fargo''), was wearing a pretty, nonpiratical dress.</p>
        <p>''I think we're probably one of the cheapest benefits in the city,'' she said of the $250-a-person event, adding that the group wanted all the friends of the project to be able to afford a big party. ''They deserve one,'' she said.</p>
