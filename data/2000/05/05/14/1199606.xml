        <p>A federal government effort to thin  dense pine forests with a controlled burn near Los Alamos, N.M., suddenly burst into a disastrous wild fire.  Heavy winds sent flames racing through tinder-dry canyons and then residential areas, and even across portions of the highly sensitive nuclear weapons laboratory at Los Alamos.  The local head of the National Park Service, which set the fire, was suspended, more than 25,000 people had to be evacuated and at least 260 homes were destroyed. The nuclear lab suffered no major damage and officials said there was no release of radioactivity. Still, officials said, it could take weeks to get the facility running fully again. Officials also said it could take weeks before services could be restored so that residents of the area can move back to their homes -- those that still stand.</p>
