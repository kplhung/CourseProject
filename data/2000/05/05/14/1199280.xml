        <p>VOTERS in Uniondale go to the polls on Tuesday facing a proposed school budget that would raise the average homeowner's taxes by $250.</p>
        <p>''We know how this increase will be read,'' said Gene Levenstien, the district's assistant superintendent for business. ''But it is literally a bare-bones budget.''</p>
        <p>Uniondale's 18.26 percent tax increase is one of the highest proposed for Long Island. But many districts have offered budgets with unusually large increases this year, and educators are holding their breaths and hoping that their 2000-01 budgets will survive the Island-wide school budget referendum day on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>In Plainview-Old Bethpage, concerns that voters would not approve a increase of more than 15 percent prompted the Board of Education to hire an outside consultant to help the district cut the budget increase almost in half, and the proposed tax increase to 8.62 percent. Even so, the increase would be well above the Islandwide average of just under 7 percent.</p>
        <p>''We asked each administrator to review their proposed budgets and make any possible reductions that did not compromise on student programs,'' said Pat Nicolino, the consultant. ''Things that could be put off for a year were taken out. This is just not the year for wish-list items.''</p>
        <p>In Sag Harbor, the proposed school budget is up 14.87 percent from last year, almost 6 percent of which is dedicated to service the bonds floated for a capital improvement project already approved by the voters. ''This budget is a real challenge,'' said Superintendent Kathryn Holden. ''We have to get voters to see that 5.9 percent was already agreed upon last year when the community approved the bond referendum.''</p>
        <p>Suzanne Bond of Sag Harbor is undaunted by the 15.51 percent jump her school district's tax levy will take if the budget is approved.</p>
        <p>''I have a lot at stake for my daughter,'' she said. ''Too many people in this community don't really understand the budget. Almost 40 percent of our increase is for a building project that was already approved by the voters, but that makes it look higher than it really is. We have to explain that to the community and they need to understand how important it is for our children to approve this budget.''</p>
        <p>Back in Uniondale, Michael Dietrich said he was prepared to support the proposed 18.26 percent tax increase. ''If we didn't have a bond, our increase would actually be lower than most other communities,'' he said. ''But most people don't get it. If we defeat our budget, we'll be shooting ourselves in the foot.''</p>
        <p>A $26 million bond referendum approved by Uniondale voters in 1997 has allowed the district to add 73 new classrooms, hire 80 new teachers, add Internet access and six computers in every classroom, implement a full-day kindergarten and reorganize the junior high to a middle-school model, Mr. Levenstien said.</p>
        <p>''Many of these changes have been necessitated by unfunded state mandates and by rising student enrollment,'' he said. ''We never expected this population growth so quickly, but the numbers are what they are and we have few choices.''</p>
        <p>Educators say Long Island school districts have to budget for rising student enrollment, mandates to meet the state's new, higher academic standards, rising costs of gasoline and heating oil and increasing premiums for employee health insurance.</p>
        <p>But many voters are in no mood to listen. Resistance may be strongest in Nassau County, where proposed increases in school taxes come at a time when homeowners are edgily awaiting answers about how much more they'll have to pay to bail the county out of its budget mess. In addition, a countywide reassessment of property values is scheduled to be complete by 2003.</p>
        <p>Bruce Brodsky, Suffolk County director for the New York State School Boards Association, said student enrollment was climbing at a rate beyond earlier projections. Several years ago, he said, demographic studies projected a total Nassau-Suffolk public school enrollment of 425,000 by 2003, but by 1999 the total already exceeded 432,000, attributed largely to a growing immigrant population.</p>
        <p>''Now we anticipate a continued growth for another four to six years,'' he said. ''That means school districts must provide additional classroom space, hire additional staff and provide services for many incoming students who have limited English proficiency.''</p>
        <p>In many districts, bond referendums have become part of the agenda, to finance building projects that will add classrooms, upgrade aging buildings and provide new technology. The state has offered a special 10 percent incentive in state aid to any district that approves a bond for a building project before July 1.</p>
        <p>In Port Washington, residents will vote separately on a $75.4 million annual budget with a 6.98 percent tax increase and on an $86.7 million project to renovate the district's middle school that will cost the average taxpayer an extra $475 for the bond alone, Superintendent Albert Inserra said.</p>
        <p>''There is concern in the community about the amount of the bond,'' he said, but added: ''Our enrollment is growing faster than most other Long Island districts and now we're spending a lot of money on portable classrooms and temporary solutions that just don't work.''</p>
        <p>Many Port Washingtonians are appalled by the package. ''I don't know what they are thinking,'' said a resident who insisted on anonymity. ''I support education, but an $86.7 million bond is ridiculous. It's one of the highest bonds I've heard of.''</p>
        <p>Joan Smith, who lives in Port Washington and owns a florist shop there, described herself as a big supporter of the schools but is questioning this budget package.</p>
        <p>''Even though I'm 65 and of retirement age, I support anything that has to do with the school system,'' she said. ''But this year, friends have told me that the budget is ridiculous, and I think I'd better read more about it and become better informed.''  In addition to rising enrollment, school districts must also cope with the state's new standards, which by 2003 will require all students to pass five Regents exams to graduate from high school. School districts must provide academic intervention services for all students identified at risk of failure, said Eric Eversley, superintendent of Eastern Suffolk Boces.</p>
        <p>''This means additional personnel to work in direct instruction,'' he said. ''It also requires curriculum development and training for teachers to upgrade their skills in order to meet the standards. In many cases, this necessitates release time for teachers and the hiring of substitute teachers.''</p>
        <p>In Brentwood, for example, the district has added a Saturday class, an evening class and a ninth period that extends the school day, said Jerry Steiner, a district spokesman.</p>
        <p>New standards for students with limited English proficiency have doubled the amount of E.S.L. services required in the Harborfields school district, assistant superintendent Joseph Dragone said.</p>
        <p>The state has also tightened its regulations for special education, requiring districts to include special education students in regular classrooms whenever possible. This has driven up costs for most school districts, said Dr. Brodsky.</p>
        <p>''If there was a self-contained special ed class with one aide for 12 students, now as these students are spread out in different classes, they might require three aides to replace one,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Sam Donato, assistant superintendent in Hempstead, said, ''The state imposes these new standards, but who pays for them? In the end, it all comes from the taxpayers.''</p>
        <p>To complicate matters further, a late state budget for the 16th consecutive year has left school districts guessing how much state aid they will receive.</p>
        <p>''In Brentwood, 56 percent of the budget is based on state aid,'' Mr. Steiner said. ''If the state budget isn't finalized, how do we figure out our state aid? If we're off by 2 percent, that's a difference of $2 million. This puts us in a quandary, trying to provide the community with precise information.''</p>
        <p>Other significant expenses that have driven up this year's budgets are employee health insurance premiums and the rising price of oil.</p>
        <p>In Harborfields, the district faces a 13 percent increase in health insurance, Mr. Dragone said. ''That's a $550,000 impact on a $36 million budget,'' he explained.</p>
        <p>Similarly, the budget in Plainview-Old Bethpage reflects an increase of more than $400,000 for health insurance, said Mr. Nicolino, who added, ''As a result of oil prices, busing costs are also going up. But these are factors that are out of our control.''</p>
        <p>As Tuesday's vote nears, districts have been making final efforts to win support from the voters.</p>
        <p>In Sag Harbor, Dr. Holden has been emphasizing that the proposed 14.87 percent budget increase has already been cut from 22 percent.</p>
        <p>In Hempstead, Mr. Donato said, ''We've had day and night meetings to talk to as many people as possible and explain the budget. We want to make sure the public understands the sociological impact of a defeated budget. If the budget goes down, the free or reduced lunches that 80 percent of our kids get, stops. The use of our facilities by different groups would stop, as well as interscholastic sports, unless private funding is raised to pay for it. We have really tried to make sure that what we put in the budget is rock bottom.''</p>
        <p>Last year was a very successful year for school budgets, Mr. Dragone said, with an approval rate of 94 percent Islandwide. He said he expected this year's rate to fall below 90 percent.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 14, 2000, Sunday  A front-page article in the Long Island section today about votes scheduled for Tuesday on school budgets and bonds misstated the plans of the Port Washington district for the $86.7 million it is seeking. The bond issue would be used to renovate all seven schools in the district, not just a middle school, and to expand some of them.</p>
