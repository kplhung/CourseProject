        <p>It was business as usual when Bridge Records of New Rochelle, a specialist in contemporary classical music, arranged to record Melinda Wagner's ''Concerto for Flute, Strings and Percussion,'' a piece commissioned by the Westchester Philharmonic in honor of its 15th anniversary. Little did Bridge know that the work would win the 1999 Pulitzer Prize for music.  ''We were, in a word, vindicated,'' said Becky Starobin, the company's managing director.  ''It's easy to say, 'Yes, we'd like to record your Pulitzer Prize-winning piece.' But our decision was made strictly on artistic merit.''</p>

        <p>It was business as usual when Bridge Records of New Rochelle, a specialist in contemporary classical music, arranged to record Melinda Wagner's ''Concerto for Flute, Strings and Percussion,'' a piece commissioned by the Westchester Philharmonic in honor of its 15th anniversary. Little did Bridge know that the work would win the 1999 Pulitzer Prize for music.  ''We were, in a word, vindicated,'' said Becky Starobin, the company's managing director.  ''It's easy to say, 'Yes, we'd like to record your Pulitzer Prize-winning piece.' But our decision was made strictly on artistic merit.''</p>
        <p>Adding to the star luster, Adam Abeshouse, above, a Pelham-based producer and engineer, became a Grammy winner after recording the concerto at Purchase College last October. He won as best classical producer for his work for Arabesque Records.</p>
        <p>What makes a producer the best? The secret lies in his placement of microphones -- his palette in producing sound color, Mr. Abeshouse said. As for the concerto recording, featuring Paul Lustig Dunkel on flute and Mark Mandarano conducting the Westchester Philharmonic, the producer said, ''You can hear depth -- it's almost three-dimensional.''</p>
        <p>The CD, paired with the BBC Symphony Orchestra performing Poul Ruders's ''Concerto in Pieces,'' will be released next weekend to coincide with the Philharmonic's last concerts of the season.</p>
