        <p>Diamonds may be forever, but fashion faddists who think forever is too long are lusting after rhinestones. After Dolce &amp; Gabbana sent rhinestones twinkling down its spring runway and Chloe used them to dress up retro aviator sunglasses, designers have been putting stones on everything from T-shirts (the one on left, from Studd, is $275 at Language) to cuff links (DieselStyleLab, $80; to order at 212-755-9200). Sonia Rykiel embellishes leather belts with square rhinestones ($315 at Kirna Zabete) and Noir offers suede versions at Calypso ($105 to $130) as well as rhinestone-strewn flip-flops ($60). Language sells ''skin jewelry'' ($35 to $250), rhinestone and glitter appliques in flower shapes by the British hair stylist J. Maskrey. In Los Angeles, Dana Bushkin turned Puma and Adidas sneakers into disco numbers ($120 for baby sizes; $160, adults; to order, 310-474-2526) that she has sold to Pamela Anderson and Sarah Jessica Parker. Why this rage? Sasha Charnin, fashion market director of Allure, who has been rhinestoning Back Street Boys bandanas ($235 at Kirna Zabete), says, ''If you can't be a rock star, you might as well dress like one.''</p>
