        <p>Many shows distribute standby tickets outside the studio on a first-come, first-served basis the day the show tapes. Although we had arranged in advance to see three shows, we also tried standing in line to get last-minute tickets to some others.</p>
        <p>Standby tickets do not guarantee admission; shows often give away more tickets than they can accommodate, and that loner in line ahead of you at 7 a.m. may represent a tour group of 35 that materializes the moment tickets are distributed. Being turned away at the door, as you watch your line-mates disappear into the studio, is a disheartening experience. When it comes to standing by, the difference between an early bird and an earlier one can be significant.</p>

        <p>Many shows distribute standby tickets outside the studio on a first-come, first-served basis the day the show tapes. Although we had arranged in advance to see three shows, we also tried standing in line to get last-minute tickets to some others.</p>
        <p>Standby tickets do not guarantee admission; shows often give away more tickets than they can accommodate, and that loner in line ahead of you at 7 a.m. may represent a tour group of 35 that materializes the moment tickets are distributed. Being turned away at the door, as you watch your line-mates disappear into the studio, is a disheartening experience. When it comes to standing by, the difference between an early bird and an earlier one can be significant.</p>
        <p>One chilly morning at 7:30, we waited alongside the General Electric Building at 49 West 49th Street for standby tickets to ''Late Night With Conan O'Brien.'' Behind us in the line were two 21-year-old students from Britain, Keri and Rebecca, who had scored standby tickets to ''Conan'' the previous day and loved it. They'd returned, hoping to make it two in a row. At 9 a.m., a uniformed NBC page distributed square blue numbered tickets; we all scattered to seek relief from the chill and to go about our day.</p>
        <p>When we returned for the afternoon taping, we found the two women fanning themselves with their tickets, No. 47 and No. 48, on the steamy second floor of the G.E. Building, where we were corralled behind a rope with 100 other hopefuls. After an hour-and-a-half wait, a page informed us they'd be seating only 33 from the standby line.</p>
        <p>''This is definitely the worst day of our trip,'' Rebecca told us. Earlier in the day they'd lost out in the lottery for standby tickets to ''The Rosie O'Donnell Show.''</p>
        <p>We consoled ourselves by shelling out $17.50 each to take the NBC Studio Tour at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, the only network studio tour offered in Manhattan. It began with a brief documentary video, with Katie Couric and Matt Lauer as hosts, that uses clips from the early decades of television to make the case that NBC invented that medium as well as radio.  We then saw the high-tech master control room and a variety of sets -- ''The Rosie O'Donnell Show,'' ''Dateline NBC'' and ''Saturday Night Live.'' And though all of them were dormant during the tour, Lorne Michaels, the executive producer, and the entire cast of ''Saturday Night Live'' happened to be on the set, posing for a still photo. Seeing them  saved the day.</p>
        <p>''Total Request Live,'' MTV's daily show for the bubble gum set, with Carson Daly as host, a mama's-boy-with-painted-fingernails type, was our next attempt. Around 2:30 p.m. on weekdays, teenage pop music lovers (18 to 24 years only, show rules) gather at West 44th Street and Broadway, the south entrance of 1515 Broadway in Times Square. (If the musical guest that day is a super high-wattage celebrity, they gather earlier. Check the show's Web site at www.mtv.com before going.) We arrived at 2:30 on the nose to find that, only minutes before, a production assistant had taken names, checked ages, and handed out wristbands to the 30 or so people in line.</p>
        <p>We stayed, hoping for a wristband.  At 2:55, the assistant led the line inside. When we got to the front door, the beefy security guard had a two-word dismissal for us: ''No dice.'' But the show lavishes as much camera time on the street-level crowd as it does the studio audience, so we joined the throng of teenagers, some bearing posters (''Thomasville loves you''), craning our necks to get a glimpse of hip-hop diva Da Brat and R &amp; B newcomer Tyrese through the plate glass windows of the second floor studio.</p>
        <p>At 3:30 p.m., when the show began, we all got what we were after as the cameraman panned across the crowd -- our cue to scream louder and wave our arms faster.</p>
        <p>''Montel'' was the easiest standby ticket we sought. ''Just show up at 9:45 a.m.,'' said the person who answered the phone number listed on the show's Web site, www .montelshow.com. At the designated time, we joined a half-block-long line at 433 West 53rd Street and, after about 15 minutes' standing time, were ushered past a desk handing out tickets, and into a waiting room with coffee and doughnuts.</p>
        <p>The day we went, Dr. Elizabeth Vaughan, a Virginia physician who'd traded in her lab coat for flashy, form-fitting outfits, discussed dress codes in the workplace. The show was lively, fun and intimate, like a heated family discussion -- among 200 people.</p>
