        <p>YOU'VE JUST BEEN TOLD</p>
        <p>Poems.</p>
        <p>By Elizabeth Macklin.</p>
        <p>Norton, $22.</p>
        <p>Around her poetry Elizabeth Macklin uses grammar as a scaffolding of detachment. She builds precarious platforms that enable her to see her past and her family and to sort through the chaotic pain of memory: to examine the deceptive facets of truth. These poems parse life's sentences. Tension arises from how Macklin tests grammar's ability, both as metaphor and as the raw material of language, to enclose her oblique and urgent questions. Sometimes her grammar is playfully inflected -- she watches, in an altered state, a wisp of smoke rise, ''high, highest, higher'' -- sometimes dead serious. Here a particle carries a poem: ''when I asked for the truth, the definite article / answered, asking but definite, ' ''The'' truth?' / and instantly repeated, definite, 'The truth?' ''To get at the unanswerable and risk joy, she reaches into the thin air where language falls into music: ''It's a long pleasure: / ongoing humming creatures, / noisemaker-urgent again -- / more than halfway loving, / as if it were songs, approaching music. / Is it really only a long pleasure / to be as I am? The scree-slide's swinging around, / but I'm not in danger . . . / The cicadas' round-and-round is / nothing resembling a human quarrel / or losing battle. Is only round.'' Because if grammar provides a framework, it also shackles. Macklin writes: ''No, we never liked our grammar / but we liked the stories.'' In ''You've Just Been Told,'' the scaffolding finally falls away, revealing poems of abrupt perception and rigorous lyricism.</p>
