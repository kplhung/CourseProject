        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Several key issues in ''Budgets Go Before Voters'' last Sunday escaped your discussion. In the town of Eastchester, we have three school districts -- Tuckahoe, Bronxville and Eastchester -- with proposed school budget increases in excess of 15 percent, 9 percent and 8 1/2 percent, respectively. Of course, the school boards raise the usual issues to support the need. But one undiscussed factor in this town and probably elsewhere is the Enhanced Star program.</p>
        <p>This program, which can provide over $1,900 to a qualifying taxpayer here, has made it possible for many senior citizens, the expected opponents of budget increases who live in our numerous cooperative apartments, to avoid paying any or very minimal school taxes.</p>

        <p>Several key issues in ''Budgets Go Before Voters'' last Sunday escaped your discussion. In the town of Eastchester, we have three school districts -- Tuckahoe, Bronxville and Eastchester -- with proposed school budget increases in excess of 15 percent, 9 percent and 8 1/2 percent, respectively.

        <p>This program, which can provide over $1,900 to a qualifying taxpayer here, has made it possible for many senior citizens, the expected opponents of budget increases who live in our numerous cooperative apartments, to avoid paying any or very minimal school taxes.</p>
        <p>Many other seniors who live in their own homes can get this substantial reduction in their school taxes. The result is to defuse the issue when it comes up for a vote next week, but it also allows school boards to soak up these funds without the usual painful paring of programs.</p>
        <p>The bottom line is, What is to happen if (or more realistically when) this program ''dries up'' during state belt tightening in the future years of economic slowdown?</p>
