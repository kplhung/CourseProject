        <p>STOCK investors are optimists by nature, believing that rising share prices can help them achieve their hopes and dreams. The boys and girls in bondland, by contrast, are professional worriers, looking for clouds long before they appear on the horizon.</p>
        <p>So it was quite in character last week that the corporate bond market struggled mightily while the major stock indexes held their ground. Still, the gulf between the two markets is remarkably wide.</p>
        <p>Most people on Wall Street expect the Federal Reserve to raise the federal funds rate by a half-percentage point on Tuesday. Stock investors seem to think the Fed will cool the economy but not stop it cold.</p>
        <p>But the bond market acts as if grave economic danger lies ahead. Yields on low-grade corporate bonds are six percentage points above 10-year Treasury yields, a spread also seen in 1998, when Russia defaulted on its debt. Remarkably, high-yield bonds of United States companies recently yielded more than emerging-market debt.</p>
        <p>The signals from low-grade bonds of small companies are even worse than in 1998. Martin S. Fridson, chief high-yield strategist at Merrill Lynch, said the yields on small issues now average 3.5 percentage points more than those of large issues. During the Russian crisis, this spread peaked at around 2.5 percentage points.</p>
        <p>One of the bond market's biggest problems is that Wall Street dealers are so loath  to commit capital that investors are finding it harder to get out of trades. ''Dealer liquidity is dramatically reduced in both the high-yield and high-grade markets,'' said Gary Goodenough, portfolio manager at Loomis Sayles in New York. ''This creates more volatility, larger swings and more of a discontinuous market.''</p>
        <p>Companies are having difficulty raising money. Thomson Securities Data says issuance of corporate bonds is down 20.6 percent this year, versus 1999. Last week, not one high-yield bond issue came to market, a first for this year.</p>
        <p>Clearly, bond investors see much greater risk in the market today. One concern is that even in a torrid economy, the default rate is rising -- to 5.6 percent on high-yield bonds, according to Moody's, up from around 3 percent recently. It will rise to 7.7 percent by April 2001, Moody's predicts.</p>
        <p>Bond issues from untested companies have made investing in corporate debt much trickier. When investors buy a bond, they try to predict what they will get back if it defaults. In the past, most could count on the return of at least some fraction of their original investment. But the Iridium L.L.C. bankruptcy, in which bondholders will be lucky to get anything, changed expectations.</p>
        <p>Another problem is that the securities typically used by investors to hedge corporate bond or mortgage holdings --  Treasury bonds -- no longer work. As the Treasury buys back debt, a stampede of buyers for remaining issues has thrown prices out of sync with the overall market. Hedging a bond position is so hard that many buyers have run away.</p>
        <p>''The fixed-income market is rightly assigning a higher risk premium to companies now,'' said Stan Jonas, managing director at Fimat U.S.A., a broker-dealer in New York. He expects the Fed to raise rates on Tuesday, but unlike many economists, he thinks this increase might be the last. The higher rates, he reckons, will set off financial turmoil -- perhaps a high-profile failure -- forcing the Fed to back off from further rate increases. ''When the Fed begins to put on the brakes, somebody goes through the windshield,'' he said. ''We just don't know who it is.''</p>
