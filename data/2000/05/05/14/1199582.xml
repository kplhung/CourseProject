        <p>The stars lived up to their billing. The supporting actors delivered award-winning performances and the defense awoke for a climactic finish. The Los Angeles Lakers also won on the road, a place that suspiciously had brought out the playoff worst in them.</p>
        <p>Naturally, they weren't satisfied. Despite preserving a 105-99 victory Friday night over the Phoenix Suns with clutch free throws down the stretch, the Lakers sounded like Hollywood executives panning their own blockbuster release. Coach Phil Jackson has them believing that perfection is the only way to win a championship ring, and even with a 3-0 lead in the Western Conference semifinals, he still has their rapt attention.</p>
        <p>Some measure of happiness may come Sunday if the Lakers can sweep the Suns in Game 4 at the America West Arena. Then again, anything less than a 30-point stomping might be viewed as weakness in the Los Angeles camp.</p>
        <p>''If we can cut down on mistakes and turnovers, we can do what we did in Game 1,'' center Shaquille O'Neal said, referring to the Lakers' 105-77 victory in the series opener. ''It's not what they're doing to us, it's what we're doing to ourselves.''</p>
        <p>The Lakers, who owned a four-game road losing streak going into Game 3, had hurt themselves with slow starts at Sacramento in the previous round and suffered the consequences while being taken to five games by the Kings. That was the case again Friday night during an 18-point first quarter in which the Lakers shot an embarrassing 27.3 percent. Yet they recovered their shooting touch, quickly rallied from 12 points down and beat the Suns for the seventh consecutive time, including four games in the regular season.</p>
        <p>''That was the joke in the locker room, that we're not a good road team,'' O'Neal said. ''We still didn't play a great game. We still had a lot of mistakes. But with six minutes to go, we just clamped down and went to work.''</p>
        <p>The Lakers' script was true to the usual story line. O'Neal devastated the Suns with 37 points and 17 rebounds and put on what for him was a free-throw shooting exhibition. The Suns tried bearhugs from Oliver Miller and forearm shivers from Luc Longley, but O'Neal made them pay, knocking down 9 of 15 foul shots (8 of 10 in the first half).</p>
        <p>Kobe Bryant scored 25 points and provided a crucial spark with 6 minutes 8 seconds to play. Driving down the lane for a basket, he was fouled by Penny Hardaway and completed the 3-point play to pull the Lakers into an 87-87 tie. From there, the teams traded leads until Bryant, Glen Rice and Brian Shaw combined for six free throws to put them ahead for good.</p>
        <p>''Psychologically, Kobe's play was a big lift for us,'' Jackson said. ''It allowed us to catch up with them and turned it into a six-minute game.''</p>
        <p>The backups helped bail out the Lakers, too. Robert Horry, the ex-Sun whose exit from Phoenix was hastened when he threw a towel in the face of Danny Ainge, then the coach, while coming out of a game, silenced boos from the crowd with 15 points, 5 rebounds and 4 assists in 39 minutes. Horry began the Lakers' comeback early in the second quarter with 8 points in 68 seconds, including two 3-pointers that quickly cut the Suns' lead to 30-26. Rick Fox also came off the bench and scored all 6 of his points in the second quarter.</p>
        <p>''Robert carried us back in the ballgame single-handedly,'' Bryant said. ''After that, it was like, O.K., we know what happened on the road in Sacramento, let's go and not let that happen again. Just the experience of a sweep would be something for us. It would show the rest of the league that we're learning to close teams out.''</p>
        <p>Hardaway led the Suns with 31 points on 11-of-15 shooting. Cliff Robinson added 23 and Rodney Rogers scored 15, but the Suns could not match the Lakers at the free-throw line. The Lakers made 35 of 51 free throws while the Suns were 25 of 34.</p>
        <p>''We're desperate right now, but it's not impossible,'' Hardaway said.</p>
        <p>Jackson said: ''It's a long weekend for them, waiting for that Sunday game. That's the exciting part for us, the opportunity to close them out.''</p>
