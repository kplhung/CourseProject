        <p>Do you need prime Jaffa oranges? Avocados? Sharon fruit, an ogen melon? An outfit for the baby, running shoes for yourself? A set of keys, a doormat, a bunch of lilies? Do you want to riffle through a tray of secondhand books, try on glitzy earrings, pick up a cheap CD?</p>
        <p>If your are an Islingtonian, you head for Chapel Market on a Saturday or Sunday. The long narrow street is flanked on either side by wheeled wooden stalls, the stall holders shouting their pitch, the punters idling along in hordes (mind your purse), the air ripe with fruit, fish, flowers, humanity. And it has been thus for 150 years and counting.</p>

        <p>If your are an Islingtonian, you head for Chapel Market on a Saturday or Sunday. The long narrow street is flanked on either side by wheeled wooden stalls, the stall holders shouting their pitch, the punters idling along in hordes (mind your purse), the air ripe with fruit, fish, flowers, humanity. And it has been thus for 150 years and counting.</p>
        <p>The word is that the stall holdings are hereditary, held in one family for generations. Certainly in the 20 years that I've been using the market the faces have aged but not changed. This is old London: ''There you are, darling -- three lemons, half a pound of grapes. Bananas, bananas! Best bananas here!'' The fruit is spectacular -- great glowing piles, vibrant orange, red, purple, green in the soft gray light of a winter morning. The flower stalls too -- each one an Aladdin's cave with great shocks of chrysanthemums, foaming gypsophilia, cornucopias of tulips. In summer they are banked high with trays of bedding plants -- trailing ivy-leaf geraniums for window boxes, sparkling blue lobelia, tiny vivid pansies, blowsy begonias.</p>
        <p>The balloon man walks through the crowds tethered to a cloud of silver helium hearts and globes -- you feel he might just take off, like Mary Poppins. The music stalls blast out soul and rap. Chapel Market moves with the times; a hundred years ago the wares would have been very different, the people smaller, shabbier, but the atmosphere would have been the same. Hustling, bustling, festive.</p>
