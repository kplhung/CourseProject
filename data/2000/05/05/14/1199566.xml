        <p>Fighting continued for a second day along the border between Ethiopia and Eritrea after the United Nations Security Council condemned the renewal of war and threatened to impose sanctions if the fighting did not stop.</p>
        <p>Any threat, though, seems unlikely to have much effect: Both nations have already endured much foreign criticism, particularly in recent weeks as the deep extent of the food shortages in the region became more apparent. In Ethiopia, as many as eight million people face a shortage of food because of prolonged drought, the United Nations says.</p>
        <p>Few details about the fighting were available today, except that the clashes appear to be fierce along the westernmost of three fronts. Ethiopia reported that it had deployed tanks, artillery and warplanes and had claimed to have broken through three lines of Eritrean trenches by sunset on Friday. But today Eritrea said it had ''repulsed'' the Ethiopian attack and inflicted heavy casualties.</p>
        <p>Both sides said the two other fronts were relatively quiet today.</p>
        <p>It is impossible to know exactly what is happening along the remote, 620-mile border. No outside observers have been permitted to the front on either side. Apart from food shortages, the war has spurred alarm at the United Nations because, in fighting in the last two years, the casualties have been so high. Experts estimate a minimum of 20,000 dead, and possibly many times that number, in sporadic but fierce outbreaks of war along their disputed border.</p>
        <p>Late on Friday, the Security Council noted the potential for huge losses, quoting the report of a recent United Nations team to the region. The war, the report said, could ''not only cause enormous numbers of casualties on both sides, but would greatly add to deaths from famine.''</p>
        <p>The Council demanded an immediate resumption of talks on a peace accord brokered by the Organization of African Unity. It also agreed to meet again on Monday to discuss steps to take if the fighting did not end, including a possible arms embargo. Ethiopia and Eritrea have spent millions of dollars over the last year buying arms, which include tanks and war planes.</p>
        <p>In a statement today, Eritrea criticized the United Nations resolution for not putting the blame on Ethiopia for resuming the war, which has been in a lull for the last year. Ethiopia has not admitted to initiating an offensive, but it has not denied it either, and its prime minister, Meles Zenawi, had warned diplomats recently that he wanted a quick end to the war, which broke out in May 1998, five years after Eritrea formally gained independence from Ethiopia.</p>
