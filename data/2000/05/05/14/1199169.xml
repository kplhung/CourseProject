        <p>MESSENGER, MESSENGER</p>
        <p>By Robert Burleigh.</p>
        <p>Illustrated by Barry Root.</p>
        <p>Atheneum, $16. (Ages 5 to 7)</p>
        <p>The world is full of exotic and scary creatures: bears, police officers, witches, dentists, firefighters, to name a few. One of the jobs of young children is to begin to understand and even empathize with the other residents of the planet.</p>
        <p>In ''Messenger, Messenger,'' the hectic life of an urban bicycle messenger is explored by Robert Burleigh with a sympathetic tone and a gentle beat: ''Catch me, catch me, if you can, / I'm messenger, messenger, messenger man.''</p>
        <p>He's Calvin Curbhopper, brazen and fearless as he zigs and zags, negotiating congealed traffic, revolving doors, escalators and hapless pedestrians. But he's also cold and hungry and tired. He eats on the run and even gets a little scared when he has to pick up a package in a dangerous neighborhood.</p>
        <p>When his long day is done, he curls up with his lonely cat on a mat on the floor of his one-room apartment. Barry Root's bright and colorful illustrations of urban scenes provide plenty to keep a child interested. Calvin rides across a bridge, zips through a gaggle of taxicabs and gazes over his city (it's Chicago) from the top of a skyscraper.</p>
        <p>The illustrations, along with the story, offer fodder for a variety of discussions. Younger children may be satisfied with the story itself; older ones will have lots of questions. What if Calvin gets hit by a car? Is he being careful? What if he hurts someone with his bike? Parents may want to depart from the book's glamorization of messengers to talk about the problems some create. They have a difficult job, but is that a good reason to break the rules? Maybe not all messengers are as nice as Calvin. Life is full of shades of gray, but that's another lesson.</p>
