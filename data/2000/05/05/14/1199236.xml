        <p>IN his sparsely furnished apartment perched high above West End Avenue and dominated by a Steinway grand, the pianist Robert Taub was poring over musical manuscripts one recent afternoon, as he often does.</p>
        <p>''When I learn a piece,'' Mr. Taub says, ''I ask myself, 'Why am I learning it?' And the answer is that I feel a lot about it and think there's something about it that I can communicate. But then I ask: 'Why did the composer write it? What did it mean to him?' And the best answers are in the sketches and the autograph scores, where you can see what choices were made and why.''</p>

        <p>IN his sparsely furnished apartment perched high above West End Avenue and dominated by a Steinway grand, the pianist Robert Taub was poring over musical manuscripts one recent afternoon, as he often does.</p>
        <p>''When I learn a piece,'' Mr. Taub says, ''I ask myself, 'Why am I learning it?' And the answer is that I feel a lot about it and think there's something about it that I can communicate. But then I ask: 'Why did the composer write it? What did it mean to him?' And the best answers are in the sketches and the autograph scores, where you can see what choices were made and why.''</p>
        <p>It is not impossible to interpret a piece of music from the printed score alone, and often an artist has no choice. Still, the printed score is the diagram of a result, whereas a manuscript captures the shape of inspiration on the wing. That, ideally, is what Mr. Taub wants to see.</p>
        <p>''No editor will print a double negative,'' Mr. Taub declares by way of illustration. The point arises apropos of Beethoven's Sonata No. 30 in E, which Mr. Taub will perform on Friday evening in a rare piano recital in the Coolidge Auditorium at the Library of Congress in Washington. The library, not incidentally, owns the manuscript of the sonata, as it does those of Haydn's Sonata in E flat (Hob. XVI:52) and Milton Babbitt's ''Canonical Form,'' also on the program.</p>
        <p>The double negative occurs in the finale of the Beethoven sonata, which starts out as a conventional theme and variations but after four clearly designated variations takes on a freer, more adventurous character. The last bar of the theme appears in published editions without either a ritardando or a pedal marking -- quite rightly, since Beethoven, having written them in ink, later scratched them out in pencil, his customary implement for registering second thoughts. He brought out the pencil again at the end of the sonata, where the theme recurs in its original form. Here, he decided on reflection, the ritardando and the pedaling mark were in order, along with a new low E, for resonance.</p>
        <p>The reverse adjustments at the beginning and the end of the movement point to the same conclusion: that the theme and the opening variations are not modular segments. On the contrary, the movement unfolds as a single trajectory, no pauses for breath along the way.</p>
        <p>Like other pianists, Mr. Taub first learned the Beethoven from printed scores; to the best of his knowledge (and he has not failed to look), no facsimile of the manuscript exists. His path first led him to the Library of Congress as he was preparing his 10-CD series of the complete Beethoven piano sonatas for Vox Classics, a survey as remarkable for the intellectual grasp of the material as for its technical assurance and aura of poetic spontaneity.</p>
        <p>''That was when I really began to realize what treasures autograph scores are,'' he says. ''The immersion in the spiritual world of the composer became so much more intense. Every printed edition is sterile compared to an autograph score. The calligraphy is imbued with the composer's emotion while rehearing the music in the process of writing it down. Some of the Beethoven sonatas look very neat. Others show evidence of greater struggle to find just the right artistic statement. Some are very messy, but they give you the sweep of the music.''</p>
        <p>Thus, to an artist of Mr. Taub's turn of mind, the spacious arrangement of an arpeggio of grace notes in the manuscript of the E major Sonata gives a graphic image of the generous elasticity with tempo Beethoven had in mind. The same little notes squashed into minimum space in the printed score give priority to mere thrift, sending a subliminal and potentially misleading message.</p>
        <p>The fact that a tempo marking that readers of the printed score simply know as ''prestissimo'' (a rare term in Beethoven) is expanded in pencil from the original ink ''presto'' likewise strikes Mr. Taub as powerfully suggestive.</p>
        <p>The revelations of an autograph take many forms. The Haydn sonata on Mr. Taub's program, the composer's last, written for the sophisticated taste of audiences in London, combines the masterly plan of a formal French garden with an English garden's lush, casual exuberance.</p>
        <p>The printed editions do not obscure Haydn's unfettered, apparently improvisatory panache, but the manuscript magnifies those impressions by orders of magnitude. Like the famously immaculate manuscripts of Mozart, it is pristine, fluent, devoid of decorative flourish, essentially elegant rather than demonstratively so.</p>
        <p>Beyond the sheer beauty of Haydn's hand, however, the autograph also holds a few hidden surprises. Mr. Taub, a practiced and eloquent guide to the music he plays, goes briefly off the record to fulminate against the reputable publishers who presume, in supposedly authentic editions, to correct ''Mr. Haydn'' silently rather than face up to his occasional waywardness.</p>
        <p>He points to the evidence of bars 40 and 48 of the second movement, where the composer's clusters of 32nd-notes add up, respectively, to an extra half beat and full beat per measure. On no authority whatsoever, editors solve the equation by cutting 32nds in two, creating hasty flurries of 64th-notes that regularize the meter but disrupt the eddy and flow of the music. No, the pianist admits with a broad grin, the arithmetic doesn't up, ''and Mr. Haydn just didn't care.''</p>
        <p>The reputation of an intellectual is a dubious asset for a performer. Among contemporary pianists, perhaps only Alfred Brendel and Maurizio Pollini have reconciled it with stardom.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taub, 43, could join them. For the last six years, he has been artist in residence -- no courtesy title in this case -- at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J., an ivory tower once peopled by the likes of Albert Einstein, J. Robert Oppenheimer and John von Neumann. In truth, the institute is devoted to just four disciplines: historical studies, mathematics, natural sciences and social science. But maverick appointments may be made at the director's discretion, which accounts for the presence of Mr. Taub.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taub lives mostly in Princeton. The average I.Q. at his sold-out cycle of the Beethoven sonatas over the last three seasons at Wolfensohn Hall there -- each concert repeated three times, with introductory talks by the artist -- was assuredly far off to the right on the bell curve. (Cycles on the Princeton model are now under way at Merkin Concert Hall in New York and in other cities.)</p>
        <p>Yet for all the scholarship of Mr. Taub's preparation, there is nothing cerebral or chilly about his approach or his playing. A comment on the way his mind responds to such documents prompts a gently insistent demurrer. ''I immerse myself in the music, and the music immerses itself in me,'' he says. ''It's not just a question of what happens in the brain. It's very moving to me to hear an autograph score.''</p>
        <p>On the experience of performance, Mr. Taub quotes T. S. Eliot, the only artist previously appointed to the Institute for Advanced Study: ''You are the music while the music lasts.'' (The passage is from ''The Dry Salvages,'' one of the ''Four Quartets.'') But of course, the music is to a superior degree the composer, and with living specimens, it is possible to move beyond talismanic communion to actual dialogue.</p>
        <p>Vincent Persichetti, before his death, couched advice to Mr. Taub about his Piano Concerto in suggestive language rather than in musicians' shoptalk: ''gruff,'' for instance, or ''far off'' (and not ''pianissimo''). Leon Kirchner, having let Mr. Taub play his Sonata, said, ''Well, Bob, it's O.K., but really it goes like this,'' and ran through it as if conjuring up the whole thing on the spot.</p>
        <p>The living composer with whom Mr. Taub is now most closely associated is Milton Babbitt, his composition professor for several years at the Juilliard School and at Princeton. His intention in these studies, Mr. Taub hastens to explain, was never to become a composer but to develop an insider's understanding of musical creativity.</p>
        <p>Looking over his shoulder as he tears into ''Canonical Form,'' which Mr. Babbitt composed for him, is an especially enlightening experience. Under Mr. Taub's fingers, music widely considered dense and cerebral sings and dances. A brisk rhythmic fanfare in the left hand -- set down on the page like Neptune's trident -- jabs out a theme that instantly begins generating new transformations, while little splashes high on the keyboard tickle the ear like memories of half-remembered show tunes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Babbitt, as many music lovers know, taught Stephen Sondheim. Mr. Babbitt, we are often reminded, comes out of Tin Pan Alley. Mr. Taub's execution of Mr. Babbitt's gestures makes the imaginative connections crystal clear. This is a rendition in the face of which prejudice simply dissolves.</p>
        <p>Mr. Babbitt's calligraphy strikes my eye as square, functional, decisive: the writing of an engineer rather than, say, a physician. Mr. Taub would prefer not to hear it described as ''technical,'' a term that perhaps reinforces unfortunate prejudices. But Mr. Babbitt, like many other composers, releases only fair copies. Mr. Taub himself has never gained access to Mr. Babbitt's drafts or sketches. ''Milton keeps them to himself,'' the pianist says. ''Brahms burned his.''</p>
        <p>IN a strange twist, Mr. Taub's Library of Congress recital complements the Smithsonian Institution's current exhibit ''Piano 300.'' An inventory of musical instruments in the possession of the Medici in 1700, which mentions ''un arpicembalo che fa il piano e il forte,''  ''di nuova invenzione di Bartolomeo Cristofori'' (''a keyboard instrument that plays both soft and loud, newly invented by Bartolomeo Cristofori'') supplies the point of origin for the three-century time line, and one of only three extant Cristoforis (this one dated 1722) has been imported for the occasion from the National Museum of Musical Instruments in Rome. The occasion would seem made to order for a recital of works played on instruments of their own periods.</p>
        <p>Pianists of the historical persuasion who might relish such an exercise are legion. But the chosen instrument for Mr. Taub's art is the modern Steinway: in particular, a Steinway engineered for maximum control.</p>
        <p>A chapter of his book, ''Playing the Beethoven Piano Sonatas,'' in production with Amadeus Press, is titled ''The Myth of the Authentic Pianoforte.'' Not that Mr. Taub scorns the lessons to be learned from antiques.</p>
        <p>''I make it my business to play for my own experience pianofortes of periods appropriate to specific pieces of music,'' he says. ''I've tried the early Beethoven sonatas on pianofortes of the late 1790's, the 'Waldstein' Sonata on a pianoforte of 1804 or 1805 and the later sonatas on pianofortes of the 1810's and early 1820's. What's interesting to me is the way Beethoven's compositions transcend the instruments of their time, forcing the piano builders to develop ever greater sonority and technological refinement. The 'Waldstein' was written in 1804. You can barely play it on a piano of that time. You can't play it at all on a piano of 1797. The range, the sonorous capacity, the sensitivity of pedal mechanisms -- none of these would be sufficient.</p>
        <p>''We have to think in terms of overall perception. Not only have pianos changed, but our sphere of hearing has become enlarged. In Beethoven's time, there were no screaming fire engines, no airplanes. A thunderstorm was a major aural event. The day I play a concert on a fortepiano will be the day when the whole audience arrives by horse-drawn carriages and the hall is lit with candles and everyone has become totally immersed in the aural world of the early 19th century. And that will never be.''</p>
