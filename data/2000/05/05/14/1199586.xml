        <p>Rickey Henderson jogged himself right out of a Mets uniform Friday night when he unabashedly slipped into his home run trot without the ball leaving the ballpark.</p>
        <p>It was only the first inning when his shot hit the left-field wall at Shea Stadium, but the Mets would lose to the Florida Marlins, and Henderson's effort, compounded by his unrepentant attitude, would be the lasting memory for the team's management.</p>
        <p>Because of Henderson's half-hearted run to first base Friday, he had to settle for a single. Yesterday, after the Mets lost another game to the Florida Marlins, 7-6, the Mets would settle no more.</p>
        <p>Henderson, the 21-year veteran left fielder who is baseball's career stolen base leader, had performed his last act. After the Mets lost another lead and another game -- the 12th of their last 17 -- General Manager Steve Phillips announced that the team had given Henderson, 41, a likely Hall of Famer, his unconditional release.</p>
        <p>''At some point, when you continue to do the wrong thing and say the wrong thing, you continue to wear out your welcome,'' Phillips said. ''We were at the point where we were having to compromise our ideals too many times.  When taking everything into account, the offense, defense and the alternatives we had, and what it does to the fabric of the team, we thought it was the right thing to do.''</p>
        <p>The Mets had already put Henderson on outright waivers Monday, but no team claimed him. He was not in the starting lineup yesterday and was a defensive replacement in the ninth inning, but he did not bat in the Mets' fruitless comeback that had Manager Bobby Valentine out of bench players, forced to even use pitcher Mike Hampton at the plate.</p>
        <p>As the Mets (19-19) slipped to .500 yesterday, potential already going unfulfilled, Henderson seemed a prime example of that.</p>
        <p>''We'll have our best chance of winning now with other people playing,'' Valentine said. ''I thought some guys felt he was keeping us from winning a couple of games.''</p>
        <p>Friday's first-inning jog, Valentine said, would have been the final straw, but Henderson topped that. According to Valentine, even after he told Henderson the premature trot was unacceptable, Henderson would not apologize.</p>
        <p>''You try to build a responsibility within a group,'' Valentine said. ''I thought I could have gotten a 'I screwed up' comment. Not in as much as an apology, but in an acknowledgment of responsibility. I was having a hard time compromising my principles.''</p>
        <p>Phillips told Henderson after yesterday's game that the team had cut him. Henderson did not speak to Valentine but spoke briefly with reporters. ''I'm a little surprised, but that's fine,'' he said. ''I didn't cause them to lose; you'd better look someplace else. I've got to boogie.''</p>
        <p>And he did. If he clears waivers by Wednesday, the Mets will have paid him about $500,000 of his $2 million salary for playing a quarter of the season. If a team claims Henderson within 48 hours, it would have to pay him the remaining $1.5 million of his salary. If no team claims him, the likely scenario, and he signs with a team after 48 hours, the team would have to pay him only $150,000, a prorated amount of the $200,000 minimum. The Mets would then be responsible for the rest of Henderson's contract, $1.35 million.</p>
        <p>''It's addition by subtraction,'' Phillips said.</p>
        <p>Last season, his first with the club, Henderson was an integral part of the Mets' reaching the playoffs with a .423 on-base percentage, best in the National League. But there were signs of disruptive disinterest. He did not run out a ball off the wall in San Diego, settling for a double instead of reaching third with what would have been the potential tying run.</p>
        <p>But his most memorable act came when Mets players walked into the clubhouse after losing Game 6 of the N.L. Championship Series to the Atlanta Braves and saw him playing cards with Bobby Bonilla.</p>
        <p>Then he reported a day late to spring training this year and was less than enthused about the team's season-opening series in Tokyo. ''I think I knew in Japan,'' Valentine said of Henderson's dwindling time with the Mets.</p>
        <p>The decision was all but final yesterday morning. Phillips hinted that the clock was ticking on Henderson. Henderson himself was like a time bomb, later in the morning cursing at a reporter and launching into a tirade about a story that quoted Henderson accurately.</p>
        <p>After the game, Valentine was somber, having just spent his 50th birthday releasing a player and losing another game in which the Mets blew a lead. For the second straight game, the Marlins' Preston Wilson -- traded by the Mets with two minor leaguers for Mike Piazza in 1998 -- crushed a three-run home run, off Dennis Cook, to give the Marlins a 7-5 lead in the seventh inning. Wilson also hit a three-run homer on Friday.</p>
        <p>In the eighth inning, the Mets had the tying runs at the plate, but Piazza, pinch-hitting, and Jon Nunnally struck out against Braden Looper to end the inning.</p>
        <p>''We just lost a tough game,'' Valentine said, prefacing his feelings about Henderson's release. ''You keep hearing guys make comments. You keep having to take the high road. But there were too many comments on the situation.''</p>
        <p>Most of the players who would discuss Henderson's departure were positive about their teammate. They were a little surprised by the move, citing Henderson as a team player.</p>
        <p>''I loved playing with him, he's a Hall of Famer, he was always exciting,'' Piazza said. ''Personally, no, I did not feel he was a distraction. He was great with the guys. I know last night was tough,'' Piazza added, referring to the Friday night incident.</p>
        <p>''I think he gets a bad rap,'' Nunnally said. During yesterday's game, Henderson worked with Nunnally in the batting cages. ''I really like Rickey; he's been nothing but kind.''</p>
        <p>Because the utility infielder Melvin Mora was put on the disabled list with stitches in his right index finger, the Mets recalled Joe McEwing from Class AAA Norfolk. He was in Henderson's place batting leadoff, and went 1 for 4, doubling and scoring in the ninth inning.</p>
        <p>After the game the Mets called up first baseman Mark Johnson, who was hitting .303 with 25 runs batted in, 7 home runs and 6 stolen bases at Norfolk.</p>
        <p>Valentine did not know if he would bat McEwing leadoff again today. He did concede that nobody would get on base more than Henderson had. He left the Mets with a .387 on-base percentage and five stolen bases but a .219 batting average this season. ''If he had doubles and was able to drive in runs and was hitting .300, I don't think we would have done this,'' Valentine said. ''I think Rickey's a good guy, I know he's a great player, and maybe he is misunderstood.''</p>
        <p>But Henderson would not do anything to change that conception.</p>
        <p>With the Mets losing their second straight game to Florida, Valentine and Phillips thought the timing was right. Once again, the team squandered chances and blew leads.</p>
        <p>''I don't feel it was a lack of effort, it was a lack of execution,'' Piazza said. But for lack of effort, his teammate was gone yesterday.</p>
