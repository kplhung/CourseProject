        <p>AFTER 20 years of on-again off-again urban-renewal efforts, State Street, which was for generations Chicago's premier retail area, appears ready to reclaim its heritage.</p>
        <p>Last month, the JMB Realty Corporation unveiled plans for a new $251 million mixed-use project on a square block across from the landmark Marshall Field's department store. The project will include a five-story retail mall anchored by a Lord &amp; Taylor department store, a 34-story tower containing condominiums and a Marriott Suites Hotel.</p>

        <p>AFTER 20 years of on-again off-again urban-renewal efforts, State Street, which was for generations Chicago's premier retail area, appears ready to reclaim its heritage.</p>
        <p>Last month, the JMB Realty Corporation unveiled plans for a new $251 million mixed-use project on a square block across from the landmark Marshall Field's department store. The project will include a five-story retail mall anchored by a Lord &amp; Taylor department store, a 34-story tower containing condominiums and a Marriott Suites Hotel.</p>
        <p>The project, which is to break ground by the end of the year and is expected to be finished in stages starting in 2002, is the climax of what has already been an extraordinary year on the street.</p>
        <p>Directly across Randolph Street from  JMB Realty's project, a new theater and dormitory complex for the School of the Art Institute is nearing completion. It includes a  17-story tower as well as a renovated former office building that will have 34,000 square feet of retail space.</p>
        <p>Several blocks to the south, Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company, which has been absent from State Street for 17 years, is preparing to open a large new store on the first five floors of a recently renovated office building.</p>
        <p>In addition, a number of national chains and local retailers, ranging from Kinko's and Radio Shack to Potbelly Sandwich Works and Nuts on Clark, a candy and nut shop, have recently signed leases in other buildings on the street.</p>
        <p>''If you look at State in four years,'' said Tyrone Tabing, an assistant planning commissioner and the point man for the redevelopment of the street, ''it will be a dramatically different street than it is today. And it's dramatically different now than it was four years ago.''</p>
        <p>That may be an understatement. In the early 90's, State Street ''was being kept alive on a ventilator,'' said Bruce Kaplan, the president of the Northern Realty Group Ltd., a large real estate company in the Loop. ''It was in horrendous condition,'' he added.</p>
        <p>After a century-long run as the most prominent retail district in Chicago, if not the Midwest, State Street went into a decline in the 1970's and 80's. That decline was brought on by the rise of suburban shopping and the simultaneous development of nearby North Michigan Avenue as the new retailer to the carriage trade.</p>
        <p>Contributing significantly to State Street's decline was the urban-renewal project in 1979 that closed the street to  vehicles and turned it into an enormous -- and usually deserted -- pedestrian mall.</p>
        <p>By the early 80's, State Street, which had  boasted seven major department stores a decade earlier, was down to two: Marshall Field's and Carson Pirie Scott. What little specialty retailing that remained was increasingly of the fast-food and adult-bookstore variety.</p>
        <p>There matters stood until the early 90's, when two things happened. The first was a  housing boom, which resulted in some 12,000 new apartments in and around the Loop. The second was the city's willingness to jump-start the redevelopment process on State Street. It approved $44 million in incentive grants to 10 developers, and in 1996, a $25 million streetscape improvement project that reopened State Street to auto traffic, spruced it up with numerous planters and added lampposts and subway entrances with a turn-of-the-century look.</p>
        <p>The results have been striking. Statistics complied by the Northern Realty Group show that annual rents for retail space on State Street have doubled in the last five years, to $52 a square foot, while the vacancy rate is just under 3 percent.</p>
        <p>THE street currently has 2.5 million square feet of retail space; 1.6 million of that is accounted for by Marshall Field's and Carson Pirie Scott. In addition, another 750,000 square feet is currently under construction or on the drawing boards.</p>
        <p>''Retail is driving the street, and it's driving it harder every week,'' said J. Paul Beitler, the chairman of Douglas Elliman-Beitler, the developer of the Sears project. Mr. Beitler is also the developer, along with the Prime Group, of Dearborn Center, a new 1.8 million-square-foot, 37-story office building under way at the corner of State and Adams Streets, which will have 100,000 square feet of retail space.</p>
        <p>''The Loop is becoming a 24/7 living environment, and people need somewhere to shop,'' Mr. Beitler said. ''State has become a community center. The whole emphasis is on providing the kinds of goods and services that you find in the suburbs.''</p>
        <p>The Sears project is often mentioned by developers and real estate brokers as an example of what State Street will be like in the future. Sears opened its first store on State Street in 1932, at the corner of State and Van Buren Streets. The building still exists, but it is now occupied by Robert Morris College, a business school. The new Sears store, which is scheduled to open next spring, is four blocks farther north, at the corner of State and Madison Streets and diagonally across State Street from Carson Pirie Scott.</p>
        <p>''I think State Street customers tend to be a little more mainstream and mass America than those on Michigan Avenue,'' said Milton Mooney, the senior vice president for Sears stores in the north-central region. ''We're going to merchandise the space in a way that will play to the strengths of that market.''</p>
        <p>The store, which is costing about $30 million, will have 250,000 square feet of space, about twice as much as an average new Sears store, Mr. Mooney said.</p>
        <p>The just-announced Lord &amp; Taylor project is also being described as one that will harmonize with the newly residential character of the Loop. The project brings to a close a troubled chapter in the street's redevelopment. JMB has owned the site for over a decade, and it has been vacant -- except for a Commonwealth Edison substation and an ice-skating rink in the winter months -- for nearly that long.</p>
        <p>Neil Bluhm, the chairman of JMB, said that the collapse of the real estate market in the early 90's led to the cancellation of an  office project planned for the site. Several other projects also came and went. ''Then the city decided it wanted more retail to energize State, so our project changed to reflect that,'' Mr. Bluhm said.</p>
        <p>The new project, which is being designed by Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, the New York architectural firm, has a distinctly modern look, a departure on a street where most of the buildings date from the 1920's and earlier.</p>
        <p>The new building nearing completion as part of the School of the Art Institute project across Randolph Street is an echo of the architect Daniel Burnham's historic Reliance Building, now called the Hotel Burnham, a block south at the corner of State and Washington.</p>
        <p>The Art Institute's architect, Larry Booth of Booth Hansen &amp; Associates in Chicago, said he very much had turn-of-the-century Chicago architecture in mind when he designed the project. ''I feel like Louis Sullivan and Daniel Burnham and John Root are old pals of mine,'' Mr. Booth said, ''and this was my chance to join the party.''</p>
        <p>The project, which is costing about $55 million, will have 34,000 square feet of retail space, 300 dormitory rooms, 2 movie theaters for the Art Institute's Film Center and a legitimate theater that has been leased to the Noble Fool comedy troupe.</p>
        <p>The retail anchor for the project will be Borders Books, which will open a 30,000-square-foot store on three levels next fall.</p>
        <p>''We always wanted to be on State, based on what's been going on there for the last few years,'' said Alex Lelli, the vice president for development of the Borders Group Inc. in Ann Arbor, Mich. ''There's a lot of activity both during the day and at night and on the weekends. It's a very attractive street.''</p>
