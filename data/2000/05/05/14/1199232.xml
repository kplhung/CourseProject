        <p>BRITNEY SPEARS is a tease. That's the gist of the title song from her second album, ''Oops . . . I Did It Again,'' due to be released on Tuesday. After some introductory moans, the song tells some poor sap that she didn't mean to make him think ''we're more than just friends''; she temporarily lost her senses, but she wasn't serious. The song is by no means an apology. It's a near-boast punched home by the last line of the chorus: ''I'm not that innocent.''</p>
        <p>For the 18-year-old Ms. Spears it's also a carefully hedged bet, at once knowing and deliberately vague. As the current queen of teenage pop, she's eager to grow up a little bit, yet she's not about to alienate fans who are still in grade school. And she's taking her calculated step at a time when, across pop culture, the image of the teenage girl is up for grabs, drifting between girlish innocence and adult desires.</p>

        <p>BRITNEY SPEARS is a tease. That's the gist of the title song from her second album, ''Oops . . . I Did It Again,'' due to be released on Tuesday. After some introductory moans, the song tells some poor sap that she didn't mean to make him think ''we're more than just friends''; she temporarily lost her senses, but she wasn't serious. The song is by no means an apology. It's a near-boast punched home by the last line of the chorus: ''I'm not that innocent.''</p>
        <p>For the 18-year-old Ms. Spears it's also a carefully hedged bet, at once knowing and deliberately vague. As the current queen of teenage pop, she's eager to grow up a little bit, yet she's not about to alienate fans who are still in grade school. And she's taking her calculated step at a time when, across pop culture, the image of the teenage girl is up for grabs, drifting between girlish innocence and adult desires.</p>
        <p>Things have moved fast in the mass-marketed portion of Ms. Spears's adolescence. Her first album, ''. . . Baby One More Time,'' was released last January; it ended with her singing ''The Beat Goes on,'' declaring, ''We still dream of sharing our first kiss.'' In interviews, she always mentions how close she is to her mother, with whom she has just collaborated on a book, ''Britney Spears' Heart to Heart'' (Three Rivers Press/Random House). Sample gush: ''I wanted to write this book so people could understand what a special bond we have between us.''</p>
        <p>But while the album was shipping 12 million copies and Ms. Spears was logging thousands of miles on tour, she quickly metamorphosed from the pert parochial-school girl of her first video, ''. . . Baby One More Time,'' into a coquette in hot pants and halter tops. ''Oops . . .'' is a musical clone of ''. . . Baby One More Time,'' but its video clip leaves high school behind. Ms. Spears makes her entrance in three come-hither closeups: her unblinking eye, her glossy lips and a pan up her torso, from thighs to chest, in a skintight red suit. The clip ends with her on her back, writhing under the camera's gaze.</p>
        <p>Ms. Spears is hoping to smoothly traverse a pop career's equivalent of puberty: the no-fans'-land between the G-rated love songs of teenypop and the sexually aware songs that could hold the attention of an older, more lasting audience. Puberty is tough on everyone, but in careers based on teenypop, maturation used to be the grim reaper. Trying to have things both ways, Ms. Spears flaunts her body, then insists she's only posing. In an interview in the current issue of Rolling Stone, she says: ''I don't want to be part of someone's 'Lolita' thing. It kind of freaks me out.''</p>
        <p>If her actions contradict her words, she's not the only one confused. Right now, there are no clear-cut expectations for a teenage girl coming of age. Sexual activity arrives early. A December 1999 study by the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University found that among 15-year-olds, 38 percent of girls and 45 percent of boys reported they had engaged in sexual intercourse. For some junior-high-school students, doctors report, oral sex takes place as casually as a good-night kiss. Yet young girls, experienced or not, still show soft hearts; they flock to soft-focus romantic movies and squeal for the unthreatening blandishments of the Backstreet Boys.</p>
        <p>Pop culture is as divided on girls' roles as any other indicator. It dispenses a range of images from sticky-sweet to coyly flirtatious to lethal. Yet the majority of young women's pop hits, which were once feared as recruiting jingles for vice, are now far tamer than television and movies.</p>
        <p>For instance, Ms. Spears looks downright prissy by comparison to television's most vivid teenage character, Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Buffy, now a college freshman, is petite but intrepid as she protects all of humanity from an endless menagerie of demonic forces. She also has an acknowledged sex life, despite its tendency to lead to apocalyptic consequences. Sarah Michelle Gellar, who plays Buffy, turned foul-mouthed for ''Cruel Intentions,'' the teenage remake of ''Dangerous Liaisons''; the results were ludicrous, but the film showed that Hollywood isn't afraid to portray teenagers like sleazy adults. In films like ''American Beauty'' and ''Election,'' Hollywood also shows baby boomers lusting after high-schoolers; moaning and swiveling, Ms. Spears comes across like Angela Hayes (played by Mena Suvari) in ''American Beauty.'' She acts like she's been around but in the clinch, she's still virginal.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, recording companies have been restoring stereotypes from the 1950's and finding that they sell. There's a renewed racial divide; while young black women like Lil' Kim or Aaliyah are allowed to be salacious or openly lewd, white ones are, at most, mildly suggestive (like Christina Aguilera soliciting foreplay in ''Genie in a Bottle''). And while boys can be as decorous or punky as they choose -- even N'Sync, on its new album, sings about cybersex -- teenage girls are expected to be mannerly again. Recording companies have been scouring the talent contests, kiddie shows and hinterlands for girls who'll seem like sisters or pals to their prospective audience.</p>
        <p>They have come up with singers like Hoku, the 18-year-old daughter of Don Ho, whose hit, ''Another Dumb Blonde,'' is pure bubblegum gone feisty: she tells a boy who's ''not really interested in my heart or mind'' that she's seen through him and he can go find another pushover. Then she spends the rest of her album promising to give the guy she loves anything he needs.</p>
        <p>M2M, the duo of the 15-year-old Marion E. Ravn and the 16-year-old Marit E. Larsen, are no less dulcet but slightly more revealing. In their native Norway, they used to sing children's music; on ''Shades of Purple,'' they wrote their own songs (in English) with some professional help, and their vignettes of puppy love hint at real junior-high-school ups and downs. They tell a grabby date, ''Don't say you love me/ You don't even know me''; they confront a friend who's trying to steal a boyfriend in ''Don't Mess With My Love''; they reveal insecurity about their looks and choices in ''Girl of Your Dreams'' and ''Mirror Mirror.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Spears reveals glimmers of ambition on ''Oops . . .'' She and her producers clearly realized that her tight little voice is in the same register as Michael Jackson's. Hoping to stir up ancestral memories of blockbusters, they came up with freeze-dried versions of the synthesizer orchestras on ''Thriller,'' and Ms. Spears clips words like Mr. Jackson. (She has stopped trying to make her voice swoop like Mariah Carey; that franchise has been taken over by Ms. Aguilera.) Where Ms. Spears spent most of her debut album pining for a boyfriend, ''Oops . . .'' starts with her acting a little tougher, fending someone off in the title song, ''Stronger'' and ''Don't Go Knockin' on My Door.''</p>
        <p>The older, more seasoned Ms. Spears is chafing -- mildly and with premeditation -- against the constraints of being a nice girl. She has a pierced navel now, and a little tattoo, and she talks back to anyone who'd criticize her new wardrobe. In ''What U See (Is What U Get),'' she tells someone, ''Now you think I'm wearing too much makeup and my dress is too tight,'' then concludes, ''I can't be nobody else and I like the way I am.''</p>
        <p>Her remake of the Rolling Stones'  ''Satisfaction'' (with a synthesizer arrangement out of Mr. Jackson's ''Billie Jean'') has new lyrics that make it not an attack on commercialism or a sneer of adolescent disgust, but the complaints of a picky shopper. ''When a girl comes on and tells me how tight my skirt should be,'' Ms. Spears chirps, ''she can't tell me who to be/ I've got my own identity.''</p>
        <p>With her crisply catchy, hitbound songs, Ms. Spears is seizing her identity the way pop entrepreneurs want her to: as a consumer. She can choose her skirt length and mascara; she can bump and grind and pout. The freedom she wants is the freedom to package herself as both a pop product and an object of desire. She'll have to grow up some more to realize how many other ways a girl can assert herself.</p>
