        <p>The Boy He Left Behind</p>
        <p>A Man's Search for His Lost Father.</p>
        <p>By Mark Matousek.</p>
        <p>Riverhead, $23.95.</p>
        <p>Mark Matousek's memoir, ''The Boy He Left Behind,'' begins with the gripping sentence ''I was 4 years old when my father came back to kidnap me.'' Part reminiscence, part detective story, part spiritual musing, the book is more than the story of one man's search for his father; it is also a look at the meaning of life and how fathers contribute to that meaning. His father having failed to kidnap him, Matousek grew up with his self-absorbed mother and three sisters -- one of whom committed suicide after being sexually abused. He became a teenage prostitute and drug addict. He was later saved and doomed by an older man -- both father figure and lover -- who nourished Matousek's talent for writing and infected him with H.I.V. Talent took Matousek to New York, where he worked as a writer and editor. AIDS helped to send him on a spiritual journey, as described in his earlier book, ''Sex Death Enlightenment.'' It also pushed him to find his father. With the tension of a mystery story, the climax occurs when Matousek meets a man he believes to be his father. But is he? And does Matousek, who has reconciled with his mother as she lay dying, really care? These are just two questions leading to this memoir's surprising conclusion.</p>
