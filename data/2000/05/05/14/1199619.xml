        <p>Even if one puts aside its religious significance for a moment, the story of Jesus, as told in the Gospels, is packed with drama moments and a driving narrative power.

But after three days, he is resurrected and appears again to the his followers!</p>

        <p>Even if one puts aside its religious significance for a moment, the story of Jesus, as told in the Gospels, is packed with drama moments and a driving narrative power. Think of it: The carpenter from a village in the Galilee embarks on a mission preaching the coming of God's Kingdom. He heals the sick and casts out demons, draws vast crowds and then collides with the earthly power of the Roman Empire, which sentences him to death. But after three days, he is resurrected and appears again to the his followers!</p>
        <p>(And this doesn't even begin to consider the colorful figures around him, the faithful Mary Magdelene, the traitorous Judas and the at-times-uncertain Peter.)</p>
        <p>As a religious text, it has inspired believers for two millenia. Of late, too, it has made Jesus a most visible presence in various secular media, the subject of best-selling scholarly biographies, cover features in newsmagazines, the main character in a couple of controversial, big-screen movies.</p>
        <p>So perhaps it was inevitable, in one of the most competetive months for the networks, that Jesus would become the subject of a prime-time special -- two part movie, ''Jesus,'' shown tonight and Wednesday at 9 on CBS.</p>
        <p>People dismayed by recent scholarly books that describe Jesus primarily as a social revolutionary or a philosopher will find that CBS tells a story pretty much in keeping with the Christ of faith. Those familiar with the basic biblical narratives are likely to recognize much in the CBS movie. As portrayed by Jeremy Sisto, Jesus preaches the Sermon on the Mount, commissions 12 disciples, walks on water and raises Lazarus from the dead. He confronts evil, in earthly and cosmic forms - the Roman governor Pontius Pilate and Satan, respectively. And he is resurrected after an agonizing crucifixion.</p>
        <p>But CBS's Jesus is as fully human as he is divine. A young man among young disciples, he is often playful and down-to-earth, enjoying festive occasions and bantering with crowds. He can also weep over the death of Joseph, his earthly father.</p>
        <p>''The guiding principle,'' said Judd Parkin, one of the movie's two executive producers, was, ''you're trying to make a film that won't offend believers, but that will appeal to non-believers.''</p>
        <p>''The starting and ending point was the Gospels,'' he added, in a telephone interview. ''We used them as our overall dramatic structure.''</p>
        <p>The film draws widely from the Gospels accounts of Jesus' life. But the film-makers leaned more heavily on John's Gospel (considered by most scholars the last of the four to have been written), said Lorenzo Minoli, the film's other executive producer. So the film focuses on Jesus' adult life, with fleeting flashbacks to the manger and his appearance at the temple in Jerusalem's while still a boy.</p>
        <p>In a separate interview, Mr. Minoli said the filmmakers felt they had had some leeway to use their imaginations, at least where the biblical narratives did not seem to preclude it. Thus they show Jesus in a warm relationship with Joseph at the movie's beginning and later use special effects when a Jesus fasting in the wilderness encounters Satan (the Dutch actor Jeroen Krabbe, in a black business suit).</p>
        <p>''When the Gospel is not specific, we decided we had the freedom there to try to invent,'' said Mr. Minoli, who has much recent experience with biblical films, having made movies about Abraham, Joseph, Moses, David and others for the TNT network. ''I think the temptation is a clear example,'' he said, referring to the scene of Jesus and the Devil, ''of being creative and being respectful'' of the biblical text.</p>
        <p>In the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, Satan asks Jesus to turn stones to bread, cast himself down from the Temple so that angels will rescue him, and accept, in return for worshiping the devil, rule over the world's kingdoms. In the movie, the Devil illustrates his requests by showing Jesus hungry children, conjuring up a likeness of the temple and, finally, by taking him aloft, to look down on the earth from space.</p>
        <p>To keep the project within bounds of historical and religious accuracy, the filmmakers relied on advice of an interfaith panel of scholars. Mr. Parkin found that useful, he said, ''even though I have a religious background and my brother is an Episcopal priest.''</p>
        <p>''You want to be faithful, but it is somewhat easy to go astray,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Where the scholars particularly aided them, he and Mr. Minoli said, was in helping the filmmakers focus on the decisive role played by Pontius Pilate (Gary Oldman). In the movie, the Roman governor appears more often he does in the New Testament. The producers said this helps show he was the true political power in Judea, the region that included Jerusalem, who alone had the power to put Jesus to death. They said they regarded the movie in this way as a corrective - in addition to the major statements of Protestant and Catholic leaders - to centuries of blame against the entire Jewish community for Jesus's death.</p>
        <p>''This is something that I'm very proud of,'' said Mr. Minoli. ''Pilate was known in Rome as being a ruthless, cold blooded killer. Now he was the one who had the power to say yes or no to the killing of Jesus.''</p>
        <p>The Pilate of the movie is often accompanied by an invested character, a Roman named Livio, who helps narrate the story and provide historical information.</p>
        <p>''Jesus'' was shot in Morocco, familiar to Mr. Minoli as the location for his previous biblical works. ''Thanks to the TNT series,'' he said, ''I've been able to establish a wonderful relationship with Morocco, to build the studio, to get to know thousands of extras, to deal with the experts.''</p>
        <p>''And,'' he added, ''to learn how to deal respectfully but entertainingly with the material.''</p>
