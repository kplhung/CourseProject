        <p>FIRST PERSON</p>
        <p>An Astonishingly Frank Self-Portrait</p>

        <p>Whatever one thought of the earlier Soviet and Russian leaders, they were all fairly well known by the time they took power. The new Russian leader, Vladimir Putin, who is 47, has been a bit of a mystery man. Outside of his former colleagues in the K.G.B. and in the St. Petersburg city government, few had heard of him. But since he was anointed acting president on New Year's Eve by Boris Yeltsin and elected on March 26, we have learned something about him. Putin has been insistent on pressing the conflict in Chechnya and in trying to give the impression that he will restore order and a government of laws to his badly demoralized country. He has stressed the need to stop the erosion in Moscow's strength, at home and abroad. He pushed through ratification of the comprehensive test ban treaty, which the United States Senate has refused to do, made a quick trip to Britain even before his inauguration and has set up a meeting with President Clinton for this summer.</p>
        <p>Much of what we know is the result of ''First Person,'' first published in the Moscow newspaper Kommersant as a sort of campaign biography put together by Nataliya Gevorkyan, Natalya Timakova and Andrei Kolesnikov, journalists who interviewed him six times for a total of about 24 hours, most of the time at home. They also interviewed his wife and two young daughters, his elementary-school teacher and friends from St. Petersburg (Leningrad when Putin was born there). Given the time constraints, Catherine A. Fitzpatrick's translation is remarkably clear; the book also provides a useful set of thumbnail sketches of people mentioned in the text.</p>
        <p>As might be expected, ''First Person'' is largely favorable to Putin. He comes across as a man of simple tastes, an expert in the martial arts, a family man, someone sobered by his K.G.B. experiences and a patriot who believes in using a firm stick to preserve Russia's integrity by putting down the Chechen insurrection and restoring an honorable place for Russia in the world. The format is straight question and answer. The authors assert that they added no editorial content. And the book reads that way. One learns a great deal of background, some trivial: Putin's father's father worked as a cook in one of Stalin's dachas. Putin decided as a teenager to become a K.G.B. agent because he was inspired by a 1968 movie, ''The Sword and the Shield,'' about a Soviet double agent in Nazi Germany. ''To find out how to become a spy, sometime back around the beginning of the ninth grade, I had gone to the office of the K.G.B. Directorate,'' Putin relates. He was quickly told that to join the K.G.B., one had to have a higher education, preferably law school (which, in the Communist days, did not prepare students for much more than party or police agency service). ''What?! To catch people? What are you doing? You'll be a cop,'' his judo coach exclaimed when told of the plan. Putin put all his energies into getting into law school at Leningrad University.</p>
        <p>The year 1968 was pivotal for the Soviet Union and its East European allies. The Warsaw Pact's invasion of Czechoslovakia, swept by a form of social democracy, led in turn to the rise of political protest in the Soviet Union, marked by the spawning of the typewritten manifestoes called samizdat -- a movement that carried well into the 1970's, when Putin was asked to join the K.G.B. It is clear that the liberal currents running through the Soviet intellectual world during the late Brezhnev years found no sympathy with Putin. Asked whether he was familiar with Stalin's purges and the reputation of the security agencies when he joined up, he replies: ''To be honest, I didn't think about it at all. Not one bit. . . . My notion of the K.G.B. came from romantic spy stories. I was a pure and utterly successful product of Soviet patriotic education.''</p>
        <p>''For better or for worse, I was never a dissident,'' Putin says. ''My career was shaping up well.'' Because he spoke German, he was being trained to work either in West Germany or in East Germany. He clearly would have preferred an assignment to West Germany, but says that he was impatient to travel, and rather than endure more training, he was sent to East Germany with his new bride. He was assigned to Dresden in 1985 and left in early 1990, after the fall of the Berlin Wall. If he is to be believed, his work was that of a desk officer in routine liaison with the East German secret police, without any secret visits to the West, or any of the stuff of cloak and dagger.</p>
        <p>His departure from East Germany after it in effect ceased to exist was bitter. The Dresden K.G.B. office was in the building that housed the East German secret police. When angry crowds in 1989 tore into the police offices, Putin called the Soviet military command in East Germany for help: ''And I was told: 'We cannot do anything without orders from Moscow. And Moscow is silent.' ''Eventually, he said, military personnel did come to help, but the words ''Moscow is silent'' remained with him. Putin says he got the feeling then that the Soviet Union had disappeared.</p>
        <p>It was clear that the union was ailing, he says. And it had a disease without a cure -- a paralysis of power. This section of the book concludes with Putin's account of a conversation he had in the early 1990's with Henry Kissinger, who was in St. Petersburg to meet with Putin's boss, Anatoly Sobchak, the head of the city government (Putin had by then left the active service of the K.G.B.). Speaking of the Soviet withdrawal from Eastern Europe, Kissinger said, ''Frankly, to this day I don't understand why Gorbachev did that.'' Putin adds, ''We would have avoided a lot of problems if the Soviets had not made such a hasty exit.''</p>
        <p>By the late 1990's, Putin was working in the Yeltsin administration. Because of his K.G.B. background, he was picked to head the Federal Security Service, the successor to the K.G.B. Then, last August, he was surprisingly chosen by Yeltsin as prime minister. Putin moved decisively to build up the military force in Chechnya. The Russian people obviously liked his tough policies. ''I was convinced that if we didn't stop the extremists right away, we'd be facing a second Yugoslavia on the entire territory of the Russian Federation -- the Yugoslavization of Russia,'' Putin says. More likely, he was still traumatized by the days in Dresden when he accurately forecast the breakup of the Soviet Union.</p>
