        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Starting from an evaluation of a minor independent release by M. C. Paul Barman, Jody Rosen advances an interesting but wrongheaded argument that humor is consistently employed by white rappers as a defense mechanism against their guilt over ''cultural piracy'' [''Rapping in Whiteface (for Laughs),'' April 23]. In the process, he draws parallels between Mr. Barman and contemporary ''rappers'' like the Insane Clown Posse and Kid Rock.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Rosen has failed to consider is a growing field of independent hip-hop -- to which Mr. Barman bears a much closer relationship than to any of the aforementioned acts -- that generally eschews narrow racial divisions. He neglects mention of many acclaimed acts of recent years that have unashamedly (and without the ''defense'' of over-the-top humor) employed white M.C.'s in a multiracial mix, New York's Company Flow, Philadelphia's High and Mighty, Vancouver's Swollen Members or Los Angeles's Dilated Peoples being only a few. These artists have garnered excellent critical response and -- though not currently multiplatinum artists like Eminem or the Beastie Boys -- are rapidly advancing toward the threshold of broad popular acceptance. It is fair to say that race has not been a significant issue with these acts: not in their lyrics, and not in their audience response.</p>

It is fair to say that race has not been a significant issue with these acts: not in their lyrics, and not in their audience response.</p>
        <p>Another thing Mr. Rosen overlooks is that humor has long been a popular lyrical element in all rap, black, white or otherwise. Acts like De La Soul, Digital Underground, Kool Keith and Lil' Kim have long made humor an integral dimension of the hip-hop scene. If one goes by Mr. Rosen's model, these black rappers do not need to use humor as a defense. The point is that they simply choose to do so.</p>
        <p>As hip-hop progresses beyond its constrictive ''gangster'' trappings to encompass more diversity, commentaries like Mr. Rosen's only reinforce barriers that others are gradually breaking down.</p>
