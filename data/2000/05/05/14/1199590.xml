        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Three cheers for Max Wallace and his article about Muhammad Ali (''Today's Athletes Owe Everything to Ali,'' April 30). I was especially pleased to see his dig at the modern athlete, who instead of being interested in social causes and larger issues is concerned with his shoe contracts and hawking products for the corporate world. Too many careless athletes do not understand the impact of their actions, or should I say, inactions.</p>
        <p>Wallace's reverence for Ali as both an athlete and as a human being made me think of my generation's greatest sports hero, Michael Jordan (whom Wallace indirectly called to task). Several years ago, when asked to speak out in support of the black senatorial candidate Harvey Gantt of North Carolina, who was running against Jesse Helms, Jordan's quote was: ''Republicans buy sneakers too.''</p>

        <p>I would have accepted more readily an answer like ''I don't agree with Mr. Gantt's vision of America,'' but Jordan's simplistic and inane response is also a reflection of our society's hollow and superficial reverence for these modern athletes.</p>
