        <p>On this Mother's Day, thousands of mothers will march on Washington to demand tough new gun control legislation, but it is unlikely that the Million Mom March will prove effective in getting Congress to act. Americans have been marching on Washington to demand change ever since the populist Jacob Coxey led his ragtag army of the unemployed from Ohio to Washington during the depression of the 1890's. Some of these marches have had lasting and visible effect, but others have been quickly forgotten.</p>
        <p>The most successful marches have made straightforward, but far-reaching, demands that the president or Congress could conceivably meet. Participants in the August 1963 civil rights march demanded that Congress pass the civil rights bill that had already been introduced; the antiwar marchers in October 1967 demanded that the Johnson administration get out of Vietnam.</p>

        <p>On this Mother's Day, thousands of mothers will march on Washington to demand tough new gun control legislation, but it is unlikely that the Million Mom March will prove effective in getting Congress to act. Americans have been marching on Washington to demand change ever since the populist Jacob Coxey led his ragtag army of the unemployed from Ohio to Washington during the depression of the 1890's. Some of these marches have had lasting and visible effect, but others have been quickly forgotten.</p>
        <p>The most successful marches have made straightforward, but far-reaching, demands that the president or Congress could conceivably meet. Participants in the August 1963 civil rights march demanded that Congress pass the civil rights bill that had already been introduced; the antiwar marchers in October 1967 demanded that the Johnson administration get out of Vietnam.</p>
        <p>The effective marches have also attracted not just unexpectedly large numbers, but usually the participation of important and powerful public figures. Walter Reuther, the head of the United Auto Workers, had a prominent role in the 1963 march, along with Martin Luther King Jr. and the N.A.A.C.P.'s Roy Wilkins. The 1967 antiwar demonstration featured leading literary lights, including Robert Lowell, Allen Ginsberg and Norman Mailer, who celebrated the march in ''The Armies of the Night.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps most important, marches that have won the most serious attention have embodied, implicitly or explicitly, the threat of nonviolent civic disruption and national embarrassment. They carried an intimation of chaos, if not in the demonstration itself, then from what could occur afterward. This sort of threat was obvious in the 1932 Bonus March of World War I veterans, which helped discredit President Herbert Hoover, and in the 1967 and 1969 antiwar marches.</p>
        <p>This last characteristic has held true for the most successful civil rights demonstrations. The massive  1963 march was entirely peaceful, though its leaders included three proponents of civil disobedience:  King, James Farmer of the Congress of Racial Equality and John Lewis of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee. The march didn't just make a moral appeal; it sent a warning that the more obstreperous parts of the movement would not accept defeat.</p>
        <p>One of the most successful marches on Washington never happened at all. In 1941, as the country began preparing for war, A. Phillip Randolph, the chairman of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, began to organize a huge march on Washington to demand that President Franklin Roosevelt issue an executive order banning discrimination in defense industries and the armed forces. Roosevelt, fearful that the demonstration would weaken support among blacks for the coming war effort, capitulated and signed the executive order five days before the march was to occur.</p>
        <p>The less successful demonstrations of recent years have all fallen short in at least one crucial respect. Civil rights marches in 1983 and 1993 attracted as many people as the 1963 march, but they lacked either a clear and achievable demand or the threat of disruption. They functioned largely as uplifting social events, as have Earth Day demonstrations, which have become little more than concerts on the Mall. The A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s Solidarity Day in 1981, which attracted 260,000 demonstrators, and the 300,000-strong abortion rights march in 1989 were forgettable because it was not clear what was being demanded or what exactly would happen if the demands were not met.</p>
        <p>Today's Million Mom March promises to be a stirring event. It has certainly inspired political discussion and reflection, and it may contribute to making gun control a more salient issue in the fall elections. The leaders are calling for handgun registration and licensing -- a reasonably dramatic demand -- but they are not even insisting that the president sign on. And the only threat is far off: the marchers' opposition at the polls in November. (Won't most of them be voting for pro-gun control candidates anyway?)</p>
        <p>Moreover, there is no hint of disorder. The marchers are not contemplating picketing gun stores, clogging the aisles at gun shows or sitting in at the offices of recalcitrant politicians -- activities that would raise the costs of not taking the moms seriously.</p>
        <p>These tactics may not be necessary for getting controls on guns. It might make more sense to create a national organization of mothers who can walk precincts and run ads against politicians who oppose gun control. That's the way much of politics is conducted today, and there is nothing wrong with it. But if that is what the proponents of gun control want to do, then the Million Mom March, no matter how wonderful an occasion, is only a small, and perhaps not even needed, step.</p>
        <p>Organizations rarely grow out of marches, as Bayard Rustin, the organizer of the 1963 civil rights march learned when he tried to sustain the coalition.</p>
        <p>If the moms marching today are serious about winning the battle over gun control, they will have to show the allies of the National Rifle Association that if they continue to block legislation, they may have to face opposition more daunting than Sunday marchers or precinct walkers.</p>
