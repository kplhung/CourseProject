        <p>Rasheed Wallace was flying down the lane, cocking the ball back as an earthbound Karl Malone watched futilely. Damon Stoudamire scooted past a backpedaling John Stockton and laid the ball in with ease.</p>
        <p>About the same time the Portland Trail Blazers were on their way to postseason redemption, the Utah Jazz was writing its own obituary, several years after most observers forecast its demise.</p>
        <p>Their second-round Western Conference semifinal has been rife with symbolism the past week; the titleless, aging veterans who simply don't have enough left versus the deeper, younger team that may issue a sincere challenge to the Los Angeles Lakers.</p>
        <p>But the Utah-Portland series goes beyond merely the players.</p>
        <p>Utah's championship pursuit for much of the last decade was about a small-market franchise that gave the others hope. Unlike Minnesota or Orlando, the Jazz showed it could hold on to future Hall of Famers, make a profit and still give Michael Jordan a genuine scare. It was about a maverick owner like Larry Miller trying to figure out his finances so he could pay Karl Malone enough to stay.</p>
        <p>Portland is considered a small market, too. But the Blazers are owned by one of the world's richest men, Paul Allen. Regardless of a luxury tax that teams will have to pay if they go over a certain threshold next season -- irrespective of a collective bargaining agreement that makes it easier for teams to hold on to their own free agents -- owners like Allen will pay for success.</p>
        <p>As much as the National Basketball Association has leveled the playing field for many of its teams, it is in many ways still a league of haves and have-nots.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, The Salt Lake Tribune pointed out the incredible discrepancies in payroll and talent between the Blazers and the Jazz.</p>
        <p>The Trail Blazers spent an N.B.A.-high $73.8 million on their roster this season, $53.5 million to their starting five. They have somehow acquired seven top-10 draft picks. In three more seasons, Scottie Pippen will earn $19.7 million, Wallace will earn $17 million, Stoudamire will get $12.4 million and Steve Smith will earn $9.9 million.</p>
        <p>The Jazz, meanwhile, spent $49 million this season. That is nearly double the Utah payroll in years past. Malone, Stockton and Jeff Hornacek combined to take up nearly $30 million of that figure, money that Miller forked over partly for their longevity and loyalty. Six of the players in their rotation were taken 28th or lower in the draft. Howard Eisley, Bryon Russell and Hornacek were all picked in the second round.</p>
        <p>Beyond Allen's money, Bob Whitsitt, Portland's team president and general manager, made some strong moves to acquire certain players.</p>
        <p>It should be noted that Utah has been completely outplayed. Greg Ostertag went from being referred to as Chamberlain-like by the NBC analyst Bill Walton one game to Frankenstein by one writer the next.</p>
        <p>The 6-foot-2-inch Eisley has been forced to guard bigger guards, and he just does not physically stack up. For all the big shots Russell has made, he has missed many more.</p>
        <p>Hornacek is retiring, but you wonder if Sloan is fed up enough to finish the remaining year of his contract in 2000-1. Stockton had to coax him into staying after the 1997-98 season.</p>
        <p>''Unless you know something I don't, I'll be back,'' Sloan said. ''Now, can we still compete? I think so.''</p>
        <p>Sloan added: ''You'd like to say it's unfair, but these guys have played hard. They've given a lot to basketball in my opinion. The losing, though, leaves a sorry taste in your mouth. At the same time, you also understand the reality.''</p>
        <p>Sloan would never say it. But part of the reality is this: For $24 million more than the Jazz, the Blazers bought themselves a better team.</p>
        <p>Mutual Admiration Society</p>
        <p>As in every postseason, they have been playing politics the past few days: Miami Coach Pat Riley wondering aloud why the officials are calling the games so tight and why Jamal Mashburn does not receive as much respect from referees as players like Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell; and Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy countering that the games are not called tightly enough, that Alonzo Mourning is doing his share of dislodging his players, that the Knicks do not have the same leeway.</p>
        <p>It is the usual postseason fare for these two. Yet the games coaches play away from the court took on a very personal tone two years ago, when the relationship between Van Gundy and Riley, his former mentor in New York, changed for the worse.</p>
        <p>If the Heat and the Knicks were publicly feuding, the pupil and the teacher were feuding privately: Riley taking shots at Van Gundy for his woeful attempt at a peacemaking role in the Mourning-Larry Johnson fight; Van Gundy seeing a cold, impersonal side to a man he admired more than almost anyone else in the profession.</p>
        <p>But after last season's Game 5 playoff thriller, the tension and ill feelings subsided, replaced by the same respect that once characterized their working relationship.</p>
        <p>It began with a simple note Riley sent to Van Gundy via Federal Express after Houston's shot sank his team. Through all the conflict and adversity and uncertainty, ''You had a play,'' the note read.</p>
        <p>Riley was so proud of Van Gundy's cool under fire, how he yelled to his players from courtside to run the series-deciding play with 4.5 seconds left with no timeouts, and how his players responded. Van Gundy carries the letter everywhere with him, along with two notes from his father.</p>
        <p>As much as their relationship has been tested by the rivalry -- and will continue to be the next week -- Riley has now put in perspective.</p>
        <p>''I'm proud of Jeff,'' he said last week. ''Nobody knows how much the Van Gundys have helped me. Nobody. They think I've helped them.''</p>
        <p>Jeff's brother, Stan Van Gundy, the Miami assistant, is Riley's choice to take over the Heat after he retires.</p>
        <p>''Jeff was the savior for me in New York,'' Riley said. ''The work he did, what he could take off my desk, his ideas, his commitment, his loyalty. When you're in this job, you got to have those kinds of men.''</p>
        <p>Riley said Jeff actually recommended Stan Van Gundy for the job.</p>
        <p>''When Jeff called me about Stan, he said: 'You're not going to believe me. You think I'm just selling you my brother. Well, he's better than I am. If you had any respect for me, I'm telling you, he's better than I am.'</p>
        <p>''People who throw these assistant coaches' names out there, new blood out there, they have no idea what this guy is about,'' Riley said of Stan Van Gundy. ''He's not about politicking. This guy is a coach. Jeff is a coach. See, I wasn't a coach. That's why I appreciate the two of them. Lifelong coaches. They've been saviors. They've helped me to grow and do other things.''</p>
        <p>Reflective about their days together in New York, Riley remembered how he once staged a shouting match with Jeff Van Gundy to make a point to his feuding Knick players.</p>
        <p>''It was one of those days I had to do something because they were being very selfish and childish,'' he said. ''They were bickering and yelling at one another on the court.</p>
        <p>''So I said to Jeff: 'Look, I don't want you to be surprised. When I start on you, I want you to give it to me like you've never gave it anybody. I want all your venom. I want all your hate. I want you to criticize me. I want you to be sarcastic. I want you to swear, I want you to say: ''You don't want to know what you're talking about, I've had it with you,'' just like these players.' ''</p>
        <p>In the middle of the locker room, in front of grumpy Anthony Mason, John Starks and Charles Oakley, Riley laced into his assistant about an unfinished scouting report he deemed sloppy.</p>
        <p>''You're just like the players,'' Riley remembered saying. ''And he started yelling at me. We're yelling at one another and the players said, 'What's going on?' We went on for three minutes. It was a very, very uncomfortable moment for them. Then finally we stopped yelling at one another and blaming one another, and I looked at Patrick and I just stared at him. And stared at him. And then he got it.</p>
        <p>''He said, 'Is that how we are?'</p>
        <p>''I said: 'That's exactly how you guys are. Did we make you feel uncomfortable, Pat?'</p>
        <p>''He says, 'God, yes.'</p>
        <p>''Well, how do you think you make us feel? How do you think you make everybody else feel out there when they see a team of guys yelling and screaming at one another, criticizing each other, backbiting one another?''</p>
        <p>Riley smiled at the memory, especially Van Gundy working himself into a frothing rage to pull it off.</p>
        <p>''Jeff had a ball with that one,'' he said. ''He was a little bit nervous about throwing obscenities at me. But he did it, because that's coaching.''</p>
        <p>Mothers Do Their Share</p>
        <p>As charity drives go, few are more original than the quilt sewn together by the Mothers of Professional Basketball Players. Using their sons' autographed jerseys, they stitched together an incredible collage spanning nearly 9 feet by 11 feet.</p>
        <p>Displayed at the N.B.A. Store in Manhattan, their Mother's Day gift to charity fetched $24,010 during an auction that ended Friday. All proceeds were forwarded to the Reading Is Fundamental program, the leading nonprofit youth literacy organization in the United States.</p>
