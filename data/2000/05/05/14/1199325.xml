        <p>EVERYONE knows the old riddle about the life stages of man -- first a creature who travels on four legs as a baby, then on two, then on three as an old person with a cane.</p>
        <p>But in the burbs, you don't measure the stages of life by quadripeds, bipeds and tripeds. You measure them by homers, doubles and triples -- by Little League. Which is why I feel more than a little empty in my first spring as a post-Little League Dad.</p>

        <p>EVERYONE knows the old riddle about the life stages of man -- first a creature who travels on four legs as a baby, then on two, then on three as an old person with a cane.</p>
        <p>But in the burbs, you don't measure the stages of life by quadripeds, bipeds and tripeds. You measure them by homers, doubles and triples -- by Little League. Which is why I feel more than a little empty in my first spring as a post-Little League Dad.</p>
        <p>Maybe this is a function of coming of age in the pre-soccer era. When I was growing up on Long Island, we played plain-old neighborhood pickup games -- baseball, basketball, football -- all year round, reflecting a degree of independence that seems quaint when compared with today's hyper-scheduled, Westchester power kids.</p>
        <p>The one exception was Little League, which was almost medieval in its pageantry and heraldry. There was the Lake Success Little League Parade kicking off the season, in which every parent with a convertible donated it to the cause. Then the cars, each carrying uniformed Giants, Dodgers, Yankees and Indians, crawled triumphantly through the new treeless subdivisions and past the ranches and split-levels.</p>
        <p>There were memorable coaches like kindly, Zeus-like Mr. Gould and terrifying foes, like unhittable fireballer Kevin Clancy. There was the thrill of getting your heavy, pre-polyester uniform, the comforting thump of ball into glove or the crack of wooden Louisville Slugger on ball. It didn't last long -- two years in the minors and two in the majors -- and by sixth grade it was over. But in my memory it seems like more. For the majority of us who would never be high school jocks, it was our last shot at our tiny bit of athletic glory, and we knew something else was ending when Little League did.</p>
        <p>And then, 30 or so years later, it started all over again, with a new cycle of life from T-ball to parent pitch to machine pitch, to kid pitch, from minors to AAA to majors.</p>
        <p>My antique Ken Boyer Rawlings glove, with its short-lived, six-finger design, looked a little ridiculous. The bats were metal instead of wood. But, through my son, I got to do it again.</p>
        <p>The overstressed, nut-case sports dad, screaming at his poor kid from the sidelines is a staple of the case against suburbia. I saw some of that and some of the gratuitous cruelty the kids at the top of the sports food chain can inflict on those below.</p>
        <p>But the oldest truism of the suburbs is still true -- that they're all about kids. And, despite the tired ''American Beauty'' cliches of soulless suburban anomie (there's no urban or exurban anomie?), suburbia does a pretty good job of knitting people together through the things kids do. Knitting together the grownups is harder.</p>
        <p>So whether tearing out of work to make the early evening practices, hitting fly balls to the outfielders and warming up the pitchers, or stopping for a post-game Gatorade, Little League seemed as special the second time as the first. There was the juggernaut of the invincible minor league Braves and our fall league River Dogs with our teal caps of a mangy dog chewing on a bat. There were a few jerks, but more memorable was the unaffected way Coach Pelosi called all the Giants ''sweetheart'' (''Swing level, sweetheart. That's good. Get your bat back.'') like they were all his own kids; the Elysian green Field of Dreams, where we played ball when we lived in Atlanta. And then, somehow, that was over too.</p>
        <p>Recently, my son had to describe a moment in his life for a school paper. We thought of two from Little League last year.</p>
        <p>One was the clean home run, a powerful shot in the gap in right center that he hit one humid night last spring, which was the supreme moment of his Little League career and one more than I ever hit. The second was his last game, a 13-4 shellacking at the hands of the Braves in the league championship last year.</p>
        <p>It was too lopsided a loss to have much of a sting, and we all went out for pizza afterwards. Then Ben and I walked across the empty field, still brilliantly lit at 9 at night. Lying in the dirt behind home plate was a brand new ball, left behind inside the batting cage, like some kind of magical artifact. We picked it up and each walked to the mound, wound up and each delivered a single valedictory pitch past an invisible batter into the metal batting cage. Then we headed home.</p>
        <p>Just as it did 30 or so years ago, it felt like something ending. And riding past the green fields jammed with other people's kids this spring, it feels that way even more.</p>
