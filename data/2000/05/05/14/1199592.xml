        <p>The Miami Heat barreled back into the locker room at Madison Square Garden on Friday night nearly drunk on the angst of the Knicks and their fans, describing the scene as jubilant and joyous. The players then scattered into the warm night to celebrate their dramatic overtime victory, which gave them a 2-1 edge in the series. And Coach Pat Riley began to seethe.</p>
        <p>He had seen these celebrations before, after Game 1 last Sunday and in years past when the Heat squandered home-court advantage and close-out opportunities against the Knicks. Now, knowing he would face a determined and desperate Knicks team today, Riley was leafing through his own inspirational tomes, searching for a way to prod his aching and aging team to clench tighter on the Knicks' throat.</p>
        <p>''You know what, there's no fuzzies  here,'' Riley said yesterday. ''We worked that game and we didn't come in this morning and talk about how well everybody played, or how well the bench played and give the kudos to everybody. Everybody did their jobs last night, that's it. They did their jobs. And they did their jobs in the way we were able to eke out a win and go ahead, two to one, and we don't want to relax in any way, shape or form and take that, 'Well, we've accomplished something.' Because we haven't accomplished anything. We know that over the last two years.''</p>
        <p>These motivational ploys are familiar territory for Riley and Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy, both men aware of the narrow margin that exists between the two teams. So there was little room for rejoicing over a victory, even one that ended as Game 3 did, with the backup point guard Anthony Carter dropping in a shot that seemed more appropriate for a playground game of H-O-R-S-E than a final attempt in an Eastern Conference semifinal game.</p>
        <p>Asked further about his team's attitude, Riley grew louder and more petulant. ''I'm tired of it,'' he said. ''They're still not there. I'm tired of having the advantage, winning and relaxing. I'm tired of players' attitude, that they've got a leg up. Somewhere you have to be men and step up and put big-time pressure into them.''</p>
        <p>He added that yesterday's two-hour workout at the Garden had ''a typical loose attitude.''</p>
        <p>''I hope it changes this afternoon and tonight, and that we come back tomorrow,'' Riley said. ''They'll all tell you the opposite of that because they don't want to hear it. N.B.A. players are funny that way.''</p>
        <p>Asked what he could do to change that, Riley paused and said, ''Let me think about that,'' before walking off the court.</p>
        <p>Riley could not be blamed for searching for a way to squeeze everything from his team, well aware that it survived Game 3 on effort and that it may never be at full strength in the series.</p>
        <p>Tim Hardaway, the team's starting point guard, practiced yesterday and said he would start today. But with a sprained left foot that got worse on Friday night, keeping him on the sideline for the entire fourth quarter and overtime period, there will never be enough rest again in the series to recuperate. That leaves the Heat counting on unlikely heroes like Carter.</p>
        <p>Of Hardaway's status, Riley said: ''We just have to play that by ear. How he feels during the game, how he's playing. What we need. I don't know yet, but I do believe we'll probably start Tim. We're not playing for any cushions. We're playing to win now. And we need him, and I just thought at that particular time of the game when I took him out he looked like he was struggling a little with it, and we needed a little bit more energy. A. C. simply played great. And I think Tim was a champion of that decision. He wants to win, he wants to move on.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>PAT RILEY's brusque demeanor was not just inflicted on his own players. He wanted no part of the arguments that JEFF VAN GUNDY and the Knicks had about the legality of ANTHONY CARTER's shot, which would not have counted had the officials ruled that he had shot it over the backboard. ''I'm not even going to get into it,'' Riley said. ''The game's over with. It was the best no-call. I think anybody's who's an intelligent viewer, that has watched this game for years, it was a no-call. And whether or not it crossed barely or whatever, the game's over with.'' Riley also said that ''the home-court advantage does not mean anything. It's 6-6 over the last couple of years in Miami and we're 4-4 here. So we're moving on to Game 4, and they can lament that all they want.'' TIM HARDAWAY agreed about the shot, saying: ''I saw it this morning, I don't know what they're griping about. The ball didn't look like it went over the backboard. Good shot, game over with, everybody deal with it.''</p>
