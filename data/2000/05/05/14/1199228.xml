        <p>SAY the word spring and most people think flowers, colorful blossoms that brighten the landscape after the long winter months. No wonder, then, that springtime often brings forth exhibitions devoted to flowers. What is unusual is for two diverse institutions to present shows on the same specific aspect of botany: the interaction of flowers with the insects and birds that pollinate them.</p>
        <p>''Pollinating Partners'' at the Champion Greenhouse in Stamford and ''Flower Power: Botanical Art'' at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich each explores the ways in which flowers attract their animal mates -- the apple blossom and the bumblebee, the butterfly bush and the butterfly, the hummingbird and the trumpet vine -- and how vital these relationships are to the propagation of the species.</p>
        <p>The similarity between the two shows, however, is limited to their common theme. All else is different.</p>
        <p>The Champion Greenhouse, a handsome glass pyramid that rises from a terrace on the third floor of the Champion Building, relies on potting tables full of plants arranged by color -- bees prefer blues and yellows, moths like white, butterflies respond to shades of red -- and simple text panels that explain the interaction.</p>
        <p>The birds, bees, butterflies and bats in question are portrayed by colorful puppets. Penny Low, the consultant who created the show, handles them deftly to show how each creature approaches a flower in search of nectar to drink or pollen to eat, picking up pollen that sticks to its body. The pollen then rubs off on the next flower visited, and fertilization takes place.</p>
        <p>The puppet population is augmented by a host of butterflies, ladybugs and hummingbirds crafted by schoolchildren of different ages and abilities -- an expression of thanks after a greenhouse visit.</p>
        <p>Ms. Low, who is responsible for creating and designing three greenhouse exhibitions a year, guided a visitor from planters full of pansies, grape hyacinths, begonias, daffodils and other staples of Northeastern gardens to more exotic specimens like the bird of paradise plant, which, in its native habitat, is pollinated by bats.</p>
        <p>The bat as pollinator has great appeal for schoolchildren, Ms. Low said. So does the fly, which favors foul-smelling blossoms like those of the Stapelia gigantea, a plant that holds considerably less charm for adult visitors.</p>
        <p>''Flower Power,'' the Bruce Museum's exhibition, consists of contemporary botanical paintings and drawings executed in a variety of media.</p>
        <p>Twenty-three painters are represented in the show, many from Connecticut and nearby states and all of them members of the American Society of Botanical Artists or the Guild of Natural Science Illustrators, trained to portray their subjects with accuracy and precision but also blessed with a true artist's eye and a love of nature that glows from their work.</p>
        <p>''We tried to show the range of styles that exists within the field of botanical art,'' said Cynthia Ehlinger, the exhibition's curator.  ''We looked for examples that go from the precision of scientific and botanical illustration and plant portraits that tell the whole story of a plant, to the more emotional approach of botanical painting and flower painting.''</p>
        <p>Not every visitor will be fully aware of the stylistic differences; most will respond to a favorite flower, insect or bird.</p>
        <p>Hummingbirds are popular with artists and visitors alike. Winnie Staniford, a watercolorist from Old Greenwich, portrays a rufous hummingbird extracting nectar from a purple gerardia, while Mindy Lighthipe represents a white throated mountain gem approaching the bright red bracts of a heliconia plant.</p>
        <p>Katie Lee shows a sword-billed hummingbird reaching deep inside the trumpet-shaped blossom of a Burgmansia sanguinea. In the accompanying text, which all the artists were required to write, Ms. Lee describes this tiny bird as possessing a bill up to 12 centimeters in length, ''so long, in fact,'' she writes, ''that the hummingbird has to hold the bill upwards during perching and flight to maintain its balance.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lee, an instructor at the New York Botanical Garden botanical illustration program and the illustrator of numerous books, painted a series of eight delightful small works for the current show, featuring pollinators such as carpenter bees, bumblebees, honeybees, orchid bees, beetles, moths and even a long-nosed bat, a night-foraging creature that buries its head deep into the night-blooming white blossoms of the giant saguaro cactus. The lovely butterfly is a vital partner in the pollinating game. Dick Rauh, a resident of Norwalk who also teaches at the New York Botanical Garden and is president of the International Guild of Natural Science Illustrators, depicts a spicebush swallowtail approaching the aptly named butterfly bush, or Buddleia davidii. In another of his paintings, a great spangled fritillary drinks nectar from a purple coneflower, its wings as delicate as hand-made lace.</p>
        <p>Another butterfly, a silvery checkerspot, shares top billing with the bright orange wildflower known as butterfly weed in an unusual mixed-media work by Margaret Berdan Arnold that evokes Oriental art.</p>
        <p>Both exhibitions, different though they are, express concern that if human interference or natural causes leads to the decline of a particular animal species, the survival of its plant partner might be in doubt.</p>
        <p>''Pollinating Partners'' can be seen through June 10 at the Champion Greenhouse, One Champion Plaza, Atlantic Street and Tresser Boulevard in Stamford. The greenhouse is open free of charge from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday. Free parking is available in the Champion Garage.</p>
        <p>''Flower Power: Botanical Art'' will be on view through July 2 at the Bruce Museum, 1 Museum Drive, Greenwich. The Museum is open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday from 1 to 5 p.m. Admission is $3.50, $2.50 for adults 65 and over and children 5 to 12. Admission is free for everyone on Tuesday.</p>
