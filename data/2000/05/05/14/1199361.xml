        <p>SINCE last summer, Jane Goldberg, a real estate broker, has shown one couple about 200 apartments. Just in Murray Hill. She has discussed in depth everything from the couple's daily commutes to the lighting that their cactus requires.</p>
        <p>Still no sale, even though the couple live in temporary housing in two different cities.</p>
        <p>''I have a kind heart and am determined to help them find a home, but they are never willing to compromise,'' said Ms. Goldberg, a broker at William B. May's Midtown office. Finally, after the couple backed out of a recent deal, she decided that working with them had become too upsetting, and she had to stop.</p>
        <p>''It's my fault,'' she said. ''I wasted 10 months of my life on them. I started to get the feeling they didn't really want to live together.''</p>
        <p>Everyone knows people who have been looking relentlessly for a home, who have dedicated years of weekends and countless hours of dinner conversation and pillow talk to real estate, and still have moved nowhere, bought nothing. It's tiring and saddening just to be their friends. Imagine being their broker.</p>
        <p>One commercial real estate broker in Brooklyn Heights purposely does not sell residential real estate. She said she did not want to deal with ''people taking the nest egg they've poured their blood, sweat, tears and life savings into and are looking for a house that has to be absolutely perfect.''</p>
        <p>Commercial real estate, she said, is ''a whole lot less emotional.''</p>
        <p>The turmoil is greater now, when properties are few, stunningly expensive and going fast. Pamela D'Arc, a vice president at the Manhattan real estate agency Stribling &amp; Associates, said, ''This is a difficult market to work in because it is bringing out the worst in everyone.''</p>
        <p>Real estate brokers say many of the headaches occur because clients cling to unrealistic expectations. The brokers mention potential buyers who have rejected apartments and then been forced to reconsider them later, after the price had risen.</p>
        <p>''You really have to be willing to make compromises and alter your preordained vision of the way you want to live,'' said Barbara Fox, president of the Fox Residential Group in Manhattan. ''If you really need a place to live, you become more flexible. I have people who would only live in Carnegie Hill end up on East End Avenue.''</p>
        <p>Michaela Schaeffer, a psychologist, says the people who shop but do not buy are just exhibiting idiosyncratic regional behavior. ''New Yorkers are consummate shoppers,'' she said. ''They will go around to 20 places to look before they buy a white shirt. It's wanting to take everything in. It's an oral phenomenon.''</p>
        <p>Still, some sales are more difficult than others. Senta Sundberg, an independent real estate broker in Park Slope, described a client she took to some 30 apartments in  prewar and postwar elevator buildings in Park Slope. The last time they spoke, the client told her he would not be making an offer for any of the properties they had seen together. It turned out she had been an unwitting participant in a therapeutic exercise.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sundberg said the client said, ''I have a problem making decisions, and my therapist suggested trying to buy an apartment as a therapy.'' But there was no breakthrough for him, and no sale for her.</p>
        <p>''Even in this sophisticated world, some people don't realize we're on straight commission,'' Ms. Sundberg said.</p>
        <p>Other real estate shoppers have no intention of moving. Dr. Schaeffer said she, too, goes to open houses with no thought of buying. ''It's an afternoon's activity, it's free, and it has to do with New Yorkers' innate curiosity,'' she said. ''And besides, it's fun. You see what other people's ideas are, how they live; like, are there books in the living room or no books in the living room?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Fox, the broker, put it another way. ''A lot of people who don't have a lot to do, rather than look at the D.&amp;D. Building, they look at apartments,'' she said, referring to the Decoration and Design Building at Third Avenue and 58th Street. ''After two times, I realize they're looking for decorating tips.''</p>
        <p>Hillary Richard cannot stop taking a broker's calls even though she has a contract for her next acquisition: two studios above her current co-op in Brooklyn Heights. ''I should have said I have a signed contract,'' said Ms. Richard, a lawyer. ''But I couldn't. I listened. And then when he called again, I realized I had to be fair.'' So she told him about the contract.</p>
        <p>''Real estate is not unlike heroin addiction, or why men golf,'' she said, laughing. ''After I bought the studios upstairs, I started going through withdrawal.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Sundberg said: ''I used to pray for bad weather. Then only the serious buyers would be out.''</p>
        <p>In winter 1996, she arranged to meet a couple and their two small children at a subway station in a snowstorm, and she knew she had a sale. ''Their little baby's hands were frozen,'' she said. ''To come out in that weather, these people really wanted to move.''</p>
        <p>Other clients are serious buyers who just cannot bear the New York market. On and off for four years, Lianne and Peter Tomashow looked for a Brooklyn brownstone with a rental apartment to help pay the mortgage. ''Each year we applied more money to it, and it was still depressing,'' Ms. Tomashow said.</p>
        <p>They looked at 40 to 60 properties near their apartment in Cobble Hill. Meanwhile, their family grew to three children.</p>
        <p>At last, they have capitulated to the market. Dr. Tomashow, a psychiatrist, has a new job in Montpelier, Vt., and the family will move this summer.</p>
        <p>''We have opted out of the competition,'' Ms. Tomashow said. ''The housing frenzy is brutal. I have such a sense of relief.''</p>
        <p>For others buyers, such as a couple Ms. Goldberg worked with, internal conflicts prevent any sale. One person had been raised in a prewar building, the other in a postwar, and never the twain would meet.</p>
        <p>''She loved nooks and crannies, he wanted cut and dried,'' Ms. Goldberg said. ''The screaming in the street was not to be believed.'' They never bought, and Ms. Goldberg heard that they eventually divorced.</p>
        <p>But all is not a nightmare of broken-down brokers and fickle clients. For three years, Steve and Mary Tager hunted for their dream house, a Brooklyn brownstone. Late one night, in a moment of revelation and horror, Mr. Tager turned to his wife and asked, ''Are we becoming the Nyborgs?'' He was referring to the unseen couple in the David Mamet play ''Glengarry Glen Ross,'' who love to talk turkey with real estate brokers but have no intention of buying.</p>
        <p>But the Tagers did want to buy, badly. And after a long search, with an exploratory foray or two into the suburbs, they now have a contract for their brownstone, in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>''I've never been more happy to have a decision made in my life,'' Ms. Tager said. ''I've stopped looking in people's windows. That chapter is finished. I can get on with my life now.''</p>
