        <p>Wall Street is fond of saying that dot-coms are a breed apart, that none of the old-economy financial and valuation standards necessarily apply. Does the same go for how these new corporations are managed and governed at the top?</p>
        <p>Hardly, according to a new survey of institutional investors to be released this week. Two-thirds of respondents said they expected Internet-company boards to be well stocked with members who are independent of management and are competent to oversee important areas of the company's business, just as those on boards of old-economy companies are.</p>
        <p>''Forward-thinking dot-com companies should closely review their corporate governance practices'' in light of the findings, said John T. W. Hawkins of Russell Reynolds Associates, the executive search firm that sponsored the survey, the fifth in an annual series. ''The leading companies are starting to migrate away from the small, venture capital dominated board model to larger, more diverse boards.''</p>
        <p>Money managers surveyed by Wirthlin Worldwide early this year thought new-economy compensation practices needed another look as well. A big majority of the 409 respondents, drawn from the United States and six European countries, favored pricing the stock options granted to officers and directors at a premium, so that recipients benefit only if the stock performs well. And they opposed repricing option grants in a down market without a shareholder vote.</p>
        <p>The investors had some expectations for old-economy boards, too. More than two-thirds said every company's board should have a formal Internet issues committee, and nearly as many said every board should include at least one technology expert. And their money is where their mouth is: A majority said they steered away from investing in companies with unsatisfactory governance practices.</p>
