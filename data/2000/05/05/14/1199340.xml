        <p>ON a recent sultry afternoon, fortified only with box lunches and their own passion, a dozen government officials and an equal number of housing advocates boarded a bus at the County Center here and made a great loop around New York's wealthiest county, visiting affordable housing projects from Peekskill to Mamaroneck.</p>

        <p>ON a recent sultry afternoon, fortified only with box lunches and their own passion, a dozen government officials and an equal number of housing advocates boarded a bus at the County Center here and made a great loop around New York's wealthiest county, visiting affordable housing projects from Peekskill to Mamaroneck.</p>
        <p>They were guests of the county executive, Andrew J. Spano, who has called the lack of affordable housing Westchester's No. 1 problem, for reasons both practical and philosophical. It weakens the fabric of communities, he said, by forcing out young adults who were raised there, retirees who can't afford to stay and blue-collar stalwarts who staff the volunteer fire departments and ambulance corps.</p>
        <p>Were that not bad enough, Mr. Spano said, the difficulty of finding affordable housing in all but a few communities, like Yonkers and New Rochelle, is contributing to choking traffic on arteries like the Tappan Zee Bridge, a conduit for those who work here but must live where it is less expensive, say in Rockland or Orange Counties. It discourages economic development. And it fosters certain values that thrive in this petri dish of privilege.</p>
        <p>''When we talk about improving the quality of life for all our residents, we must attack the lack of affordable housing,'' Mr. Spano declared in his State of the County address. ''Every study -- whether the subject is transportation, economic development, planning or senior services -- refers to it as the county's most crucial problem.''</p>
        <p>But the county has no power, except for the bully pulpit, when it comes to land use decisions by its 43 municipalities. And so Mr. Spano, a Democrat, has begun a $250,000 public relations campaign to help overcome resistance from residents and elected leaders.</p>
        <p>''We've got to show that the political numbers are greater for than against,'' said Mr. Spano, whose initiatives include using county money to buy land for such developments, giving legal and technical assistance to municipalities and developers, and tying the distribution of discretionary funds to a community's record in building affordable housing.</p>
        <p>Each municipality, under authority granted by the state, drafts its own zoning regulations; approves, rejects or stalls projects as it sees fit. And with a few exceptions, most of Westchester's towns and villages vigorously resist the idea of opening the gates of paradise to those who can not afford to enter without subsidy.</p>
        <p>The problem with that attitude is that virtually nobody can afford to live here anymore, including the people who already do, since the median house price is $365,000 and rising.</p>
        <p>A case in point is Ron Bianchi, the mayor and supervisor of Harrison. ''A lot of us, including myself, couldn't buy the houses we're living in now,'' Mr. Bianchi said. ''My three sons, none of them can afford to live here.''</p>
        <p>The irony of Mr. Bianchi's lament may be lost on all but county insiders. His community, it turns out, is the most recalcitrant in Westchester when it comes to building affordable housing, refusing even to endorse a nonbinding county resolution that sets goals for each municipality. Harrison, a contiguous town and village, was urged to build 307 units in the last decade. It built none. It plans none. It wants none, Mr. Bianchi said.</p>
        <p>There are few places in the United States where the gap is greater between the cost of housing and the wages of all but the fabulously rich. ''In years gone by, the basic premise of housing policy was, If you could work you could afford a place to live,'' said Nicolas P. Retsinas, director of the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University, who recently viewed the situation here firsthand during a speaking engagement. ''Now, that connection is broken.''</p>
        <p>The numbers are eye popping, proof that Westchester has pulled the welcome mat out from under people who would be solidly middle class virtually anywhere else, but for a few exceptions like Silicon Valley in California and Fairfax County in Virginia.</p>
        <p>To be eligible for affordable housing, according to government regulations, an individual or family must earn less than 80 percent of the local median income. In Westchester, the median income for a family of four is $83,100, which means that a family earning $66,480 would qualify for help.</p>
        <p>Again using a government formula, which says housing should cost 30 percent of gross income, that hypothetical family of four should spend no more that $1,600 a month, either in rent or mortgage payments, the ceiling for housing that meets the ''affordable'' criteria. To find market-rate housing at that cost in most parts of Westchester is impossible.</p>
        <p>County planners say that without equity from a previous real estate investment, an income of $110,000 would be required to buy a typical home. And apartments have all but disappeared. About 40,000 were lost to condominium conversions in the 1980's. Only 10,000 rental units remain, or 16 percent of the housing stock countywide, so landlords can charge premium prices.</p>
        <p>It is this set of economic conditions, worsening every day, that drives the need to build affordable housing, whether in clusters of new townhouses, in derelict buildings rehabilitated for that purpose, above stores and offices or in accessory apartments in private homes.</p>
        <p>To that end, the county created the Housing Opportunity Commission a decade ago and, with assistance from the Rutgers University Center for Urban Policy Research, set goals for the county as a whole and allocations for each municipality. Westchester is the only county in New York State, outside the five boroughs, to do so.</p>
        <p>But, the results have been disheartening, to put it mildly.</p>
        <p>The countywide goal was 5,000 units in the decade just ended. Fewer than half that many were built. Of the 43 municipalities, 19 failed even to respond with a vague statement of good intentions. Two of those, Yonkers and Cortlandt, are under court order to produce low-income housing. Two others, Harrison and Port Chester, passed resolutions of opposition to the county goals. The cooperation of the remaining towns and villages has been uneven. New goals will be set after the 2000 census, with the county then playing a desperate game of catch-up.</p>
        <p>The county's campaign, including glossy informational brochures, is intended to educate the public about who it is that needs this housing, to disabuse a wary citizenry that they are being asked to welcome welfare mothers or minimum-wage workers. But explaining that the target buyer or renter is a local teacher or firefighter, the grown children or aging parents of residents is only a partial solution.</p>
        <p>Resistance is driven by other concerns, the recurring themes in all Nimby disputes. Preserving open land. Preventing clusters of bland town houses in neighborhoods of beautiful old homes. Holding down school enrollment and thus taxes. Sustaining property values. Controlling local traffic. Not interfering with one person's views or another's fondness for the woods nearby.</p>
        <p>''People are oriented to their own comforts and their own bottom line,'' said John R. Nolon, director of the Land Use Center at the Pace University School of Law. ''Our appetites, desires and whims drive this problem, absent over-riding state authority.''</p>
        <p>And there is no over-riding state authority in New York that forces municipalities to create a full range of housing opportunities.</p>
        <p>A series of court cases, beginning with Berenson v. New Castle, which was decided by the State Court of Appeals in 1975, asserts that ''regional considerations must be reflected in local zoning.''</p>
        <p>But despite its condemnation of exclusionary zoning, neither Berenson nor several cases that followed include any enforcement mechanism. Thus municipalities flout the courts at will, as North Salem has done for seven years by ignoring a court order regarding the illegal upzoning of 63 acres from multifamily dwellings to two-acre parcels, which effectively eliminates the possibility of building affordable units there.</p>
        <p>New Jersey, by contrast, has mandated the construction of affordable housing though court cases known collectively as the Mount Laurel rulings. The New Jersey court adopted a statewide allocation plan. The court also retained jurisdiction over any cases brought by developers against recalcitrant municipalities, appointed special masters to ensure follow through and set timetables for compliance, none of which was done by the New York courts.</p>
        <p>''It's the difference between 'ought to' versus 'must,' '' said George M. Raymond, chairman of the Westchester Housing Opportunity Commission, who cut his teeth in this field as special master in 14 New Jersey communities.</p>
        <p>Connecticut tackled the problem legislatively by passing the Affordable Housing Appeals Act in 1988. Any community that does not already have 10 percent of its housing in the affordable range is subject to the law. In these communities, if a developer proposes a project with 20 percent of its units affordable and is turned down because of restrictive zoning, that denial is deemed illegal unless the municipality can show a clear public purpose. That reverses the burden of proof from the usual scenario, where a developer seeking a zoning variance comes to the planning board hat in hand and is usually rejected.</p>
        <p>''Where the political will is there, it can happen,'' Mr. Raymond said.</p>
        <p>Certain Westchester communities have shown that political will. The town of Greenburgh, alone in the county, has enacted a requirement that any development in districts zoned for multifamily dwellings must include one affordable unit for every nine priced at market rate.</p>
        <p>Such inclusionary projects, as they are known, are favored by many advocates because they integrate subsidized and market-rate units, with no apparent distinction. By legislating inclusionary housing, Greenburgh is encouraging private building without dependence on government subsidies, which are highly competitive, difficult to apply for and thus beyond the expertise of all but a few developers who specialize in affordable housing.</p>
        <p>The town of New Castle, which includes the wealthy hamlets of Chappaqua and Millwood, has also shown leadership. The town was supportive of a project, developed by Wilder Balter Partners of Elmsford, with 52 two-family town houses, each with an owner-occupied portion and a rental flat below. And New Castle has a request for proposals out on another site, which it intends to rezone for multifamily dwellings.</p>
        <p>This is a reversal of the more common upzoning, which makes lots larger and larger and thus limits them to the very rich. Somers, for instance, has upzoned 15 square miles to parcels of two to three acres, over the objections of the County Planning Board. ''They have created a gated community without gates,'' said Raymond Seidelman, a professor of political science at Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers.</p>
        <p>New Castle also inspired a county program of financial and technical aid to people in large houses who are willing to add an affordable accessory apartment.</p>
        <p>The town administrator, Jerry Faiella, said his goal is to create ''cradle to grave housing options,'' and thus ''generational stability,'' while enabling town employees and volunteers to live side by side with the people they serve.</p>
        <p>He said that this attitude is not always popular and that his planning board meetings, like those across the county, draw strident opponents. ''I've heard every reason not to do it,'' he said. ''The board's got to make a decision whether they want it to happen or not.''</p>
        <p>That attitude is not shared by Mr. Bianchi, mayor and supervisor of Harrison, the county's poster child for noncompliance with its housing goals. Mr. Bianchi says his constituents are against providing housing for people who can't afford it on their own, since longtime residents ''had to pay their fair share.''</p>
        <p>When reminded that housing prices have risen exponentially and that current residents could not afford their houses today, Mr. Bianchi tacked in another direction. Residents of Harrison, he said, ''don't trust the government'' and fear that units set aside today for families earning $60,000 could wind up occupied by the poor.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bianchi said he does not share their skepticism. ''But I have great respect for the wishes of people who live in this town,'' he said. ''I'm not going to go out and do something that they feel short-changes them.''</p>
        <p>Developers of affordable housing shun communities that do not welcome them, since the task is hard enough, and the profit margins too low, to permit time-consuming and costly political battles or litigation. To make a project viable requires concessions from the local government, like density bonuses for including affordable units, along with a jigsaw puzzle of Federal, state and county subsidies.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Rose, scion of the Rose family real estate dynasty in New York City, is widely considered the guru of affordable housing here. Other developers say that no one is more expert in layering the available sources of financing, a task so time consuming and complex that few attempt it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rose argues that the obstacles to building affordable housing here are surmountable, were the development community not so profit driven. But most developers are less sanguine.</p>
        <p>They say that Westchester is in a class by itself in terms of resisting development of any kind, not merely affordable housing. ''It's hard to get anything built here -- a shopping center, a garden apartment, a million dollar house -- because of sensitivity about density,'' said Robert H. Wilder Jr. of Wilder Balter Partners, which calls itself the state's largest developer of affordable housing.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wilder and his partner, William G. Balter, proudly display renderings of their projects elsewhere -- Goshen, Middletown, Ballston Spa, Babylon, to name a few. In the last 10 years, they say, they have built more than 1,000 affordable units outside Westchester and just 92 in the county.</p>
        <p>''If we could do all our work within 20 minutes of our office, don't you think we would?'' Mr. Wilder asked. ''The opportunities don't present themselves. It's so much harder here. Sure, it's hard every place: hard but doable.''</p>
