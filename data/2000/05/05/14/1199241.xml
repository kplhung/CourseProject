        <p>WHEN Rupert Penry-Jones first started reading ''Don Carlos,'' the Friedrich Schiller play that brings him to New York this week, he was only three pages into it before he thought: ''This is too long, too wordy.''</p>
        <p>But after another 10 pages or so, as Mr. Penry-Jones, a 29-year-old English actor, recollects it: ''I couldn't put it down. I thought: 'It's like a medieval soap opera. There's nothing frightening about it.' ''</p>
        <p>The result has been the best reviews to date of Mr. Penry-Jones's career, as well as a surprise hit for the Royal Shakespeare Company in a realm -- 18th-century German expressionism -- not often explored by Britain's heavyweight theaters.</p>
        <p>''Don Carlos'' will be presented by the R.S.C. at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Harvey Lichtenstein Theater for five performances beginning Tuesday, as part of the troupe's residency this month at BAM. (The final offering, ''A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' opens at BAM next Sunday.)</p>
        <p>As the title character, Mr. Penry-Jones plays a young Spanish prince during the Inquisition who is smitten to the point of Hamlet-like derangement with Elizabeth of Valois, his father the king's third wife. Cast as the queen is Josette Simon, the willowy English actress who first gained attention in London about a decade ago as the first black Maggie in Arthur Miller's play ''After the Fall.''</p>
        <p>History tells us that the real Don Carlos died in questionable circumstances in 1568 at the age of 23. More to the point, the actual Spanish prince was known for being not just mentally unstable but physically deformed, in marked contrast to Mr. Penry-Jones's good looks. ''Don Carlos is always played by a handsome boy,'' said the play's director, Gale Edwards, laughing. ''That's the terrible thing.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Edwards has an extensive resume in musical theater and opera. She is currently represented on Broadway by the new revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber's ''Jesus Christ Superstar'' at the Ford Center for the Performing Arts, while her London version of the same composer's ''Whistle Down the Wind'' starts its third year on the West End in July. Neither production received great reviews, to put it mildly.</p>
        <p>According to Ms. Edwards, a 45-year-old Australian who has lived for the last six years in London, ''Don Carlos'' illustrates far better ''where my heart is'' than do the Lloyd Webber shows. That affiliation, she said, ''has been relatively recent and, in percentage terms, is quite small compared with other work.'' She has also directed Lord Lloyd-Webber's ''Aspects of Love'' in Australia and Britain.</p>
        <p>''I'm a classical director first and foremost,'' Ms. Edwards said. ''The gravity of most of my work has been classical theater; the musical stuff is the flotation in my life.''</p>
        <p>Still, why Schiller, a writer whose work, as Ms. Edwards acknowledges, ''is obscure enough at the best of times''?</p>
        <p>She came to the play, she said, through opera, directing Donizetti's ''Maria Stuarda'' for the English National Opera in London in 1998. Ms. Edwards found herself steeped in Schiller -- and not just ''Mary Stuart,'' on which Donizetti's 1834 opera is based. (''Don Carlos,'' of course, has inspired its own opera, the Verdi treatment of 1867.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Edwards read ''Don Carlos'' and reacted strongly to it. ''God, this is a great play,'' she recalled thinking to herself. ''But it's about 5 1/2 hours long and very dense. There's probably a rather brilliant three-hour play here.'' She ultimately took her proposal to the Royal Shakespeare Company. Several years before, she had worked there, directing a well-regarded production of ''The White Devil,'' Webster's 1612 Jacobean classic. In choosing an English-language text for Schiller's play, Ms. Edwards opted for an existing translation -- by Robert David MacDonald, a Scottish writer and director -- which she has trimmed.</p>
        <p>The Webster and Schiller plays, Ms. Edwards said, have much in common, starting with a similar density, not to mention a shared focus on bloodletting as well as issues of tyranny and injustice. In the fall, she will return to the R.S.C. to direct a third play, Webster's ''Duchess of Malfi,'' in what Ms. Edwards regards as an informal but identifiable theatrical triptych.</p>
        <p>''Each of the three plays is concerned with a system threatened by a free thinker, a free spirit,'' she said. ''And in each case, the system wins. They are dark, bloody political stories -- as well as three of the most difficult plays ever written, in terms of carrying an audience through a labyrinthine plot and an incredibly bleak view of the world.''</p>
        <p>So it was with something approaching delighted surprise that critics and audiences alike responded to ''Don Carlos,'' first in Stratford last June and then in London in January. ''Theater at its most theatrical,'' said Michael Billington in The Guardian. The performances led Charles Spencer in The Daily Telegraph to praise ''the R.S.C. at the very top of its form.'' Mr. Penry-Jones, he said, possessed ''the brooding intensity of a heart-throb star.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Penry-Jones's portrait of the distraught prince follows celebrated appearances at the National Theater in 1997 in Arnold Wesker's ''Chips With Everything'' and at the Almeida Theater in 1998 as the tearful, anxious father in Edward Albee's ''Play About the Baby.''</p>
        <p>The Schiller production has also helped remind London audiences of the authority of John Woodvine, the British stage veteran who plays the unyielding Philip II of Spain .</p>
        <p>''The narrative drive is certainly fantastic,'' said Mr. Woodvine about Schiller's story, especially, he added, given that Schiller ''is probably known no more in England than in America.'' Beethoven lovers, of course, know Schiller's ''Ode to Joy'' from the last movement of the Ninth Symphony.</p>
        <p>So here he is, at 70, returning to a city in which he last appeared on Broadway in 1981 in ''Nicholas Nickleby'' as Uncle Ralph. (Mr. Woodvine's wife, Lynn Farleigh, was seen earlier this month in the first R.S.C. production of its season at BAM, T. S. Eliot's ''Family Reunion.'')</p>
        <p>''It's been wonderful for me,'' said Mr. Woodvine of his latest role. ''There aren't too many parts this good for an elderly gentleman.''</p>
