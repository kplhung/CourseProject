        <p>REMEMBER the sensation of flying -- feet sticking straight out, the world rushing by in greens and blues, the surging feeling of power and excitement -- all from playing on a swing on a summer day?</p>
        <p>The swing is possibly the most underrated toy around. You rarely see a public playground without one. The acquisition of a backyard swing set is nearly a rite of passage for a suburban homeowner. And the most basic models -- a plank of wood suspended from two ropes or an old tire tied to a tree -- still hold their own in competition with top-of-the-line play sets of cedar redwood.</p>
        <p>Moreover, a swing is one of the few toys you can use nearly all your life. Infant swings have long been used to calm fussy babies. Children and adults alike can play on regular swings. Hammocks appeal to the older set, as do porch swings.</p>
        <p>''A swing is just the symbol of having fun, and it can be played with from the moment a child comes out of the womb until basically the day you die,'' said Louis M. Kohus, an inventor and product designer who has studied swings extensively. ''There is not a normal person -- I'm not talking about someone with a hardened heart -- but not a normal person who can pass by a swing without wanting to sit down.''</p>
        <p>Among the pleasures of swings is the soothing, rhythmic motion.</p>
        <p>''It does harken back to the cradle,'' said Dr. Flemming Graae, a child psychiatrist at the Westchester Division of New York-Presbyterian Hospital. ''How do you soothe your child? You rock your child. How do you calm the anxiety and the tears? You rock your child. There's something fundamentally soothing about it -- it's physiological and it's visceral.''</p>
        <p>Swinging can be so deeply relaxing as to become almost hypnotic. Children and adults can withdraw quietly into their own thoughts or engage in active fantasies. The fantasy play that swings inspire add to their popularity. Children on swings can pretend they are riding a horse, landing an airplane or dancing across a stage.</p>
        <p>''A swing is a magical vehicle for quickly and happily transporting us into our dreams,'' said Dr. Stevanne Auerbach, who is also known as Dr. Toy and has written two books on child's play. ''It gives children the possibility of being whatever they want their swing to be, every time they play -- and that is part of the adventure of using it. The swing takes them to other places in their minds and bodies.''</p>
        <p>Children also grow up on their swings. Gradually, they learn and improve their motor skills. There are mechanical infant swings. There are toddler swings that hold a small child safely. The cries of ''Push me! Push me!'' ringing across a playground signify another stage, when a child can hold on to the swing but still needs a parent or older sibling to set her in motion. And then there is a critical rite of passage, when a child moves from flailing his legs fruitlessly, to the first successful self-propulsion of pumping. Finally, he is flying himself.</p>
        <p>As children get older they often like to use swings to test boundaries -- flying as high as they can go, sometimes practically upside down. Jumping off a swing in midair or twisting up a swing and whirling around until almost sick with dizziness also can provide thrills for older children.</p>
        <p>Toy manufacturers say that swings are universal in other ways. Both boys and girls like them. They can be both a solitary and a group toy. And children can learn about social interaction from swings, by taking turns and sharing.</p>
        <p>It seems swings have been around forever, though historians date swings in America at public playgrounds -- originally known as sand gardens -- from the mid-1800's. But it is not difficult to imagine Colonial parents throwing a rope over a tree and attaching a wooden plank to it, or man's earliest ancestors swinging on vines simply for the fun of it.</p>
        <p>About three million swing sets were sold in the United States in 1999, said Diane Cardinale of the Toy Manufacturers of America, based in Manhattan. Ms. Cardinale said there had been several trends in mass-produced swing sets over the last two decades. First, lightweight aluminum replaced heavy iron swings. Aluminum was replaced by plastic, which in turn was replaced by treated woods like pine, fir, cedar and redwood. Swing sets have also expanded in their features, first including gliders, slides and rings and more recently forts, tunnels, canvas roofs and coverings, mock steering wheels, telescopes, and more.</p>
        <p>The cost of swing sets varies dramatically. A simple swing might retail for about $25 dollars. Hammacher Schlemmer offers a 21-foot Splinter-Free Cedar Play Center for $3,999. (The price does not include an extra $300 shipping charge on top of a regular delivery charge.) Parents should be warned that the set -- which includes a treehouse, a built-in sandbox with mesh cover, a 12-foot slide, a climbing wall with hand holds, two knotted ropes, a climbing net, two single swings and a double bronco swing, a trapeze bar and 60 maple climbing rungs -- comes only partly assembled.</p>
        <p>Swing safety is regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. The key elements to keeping play sets safe include providing a protective surface underneath the swings, keeping the area around the swing free from other equipment or obstacles and spacing the swings an adequate distance apart. Play sets also need to be inspected and maintained on a regular basis. (Check www.cpsc.gov/cpscpub/pubs/ 323.html for detailed information.)</p>
        <p>But once the swing is safely in place, there is no better prescription for summer relaxation: kick back, rock gently and be transported.</p>
        <p>''There is just nothing like a swing,'' said Mr. Kohus, the product designer. ''It is such a neat toy but everyone takes it for granted. What I find amazing is that there are tons of places you can find the 100 best most classic toys ever. They'll have marbles, jacks, frisbees, hoolahoops. I say, 'Where's the swing?' ''</p>
