        <p>FIFTEEN years ago John Livanos and his children opened an elaborate restaurant they named for the family.</p>
        <p>The restaurant, Livanos, is no longer in operation. But Mr. Livanos, his sons Nicholas and Bill and his daughter, Corina, now own three other restaurants in Westchester -- City Limits Diner on Central Avenue and City Limits Diner in the Westchester Mall, both in White Plains, and Cafe Meze in Hartsdale -- as well as two in midtown Manhattan, Oceana and Molyvos.</p>
        <p>To celebrate 15 years in business in Westchester County, on Tuesday, chefs from all five restaurants will meet at City Limits on Central Avenue and make some of their signature dishes from 5:30 to 11 p.m. They'll be served at prices ranging from $7 for appetizers to $22 for entrees. (For information and reservations, call 686-9000.)</p>
        <p>Nicholas Livanos, who lives in Ardsley, sees the evening as a kind of ''cross promoting'' of the restaurants. Already, he said, some of the  corporate chiefs who have lunch in Oceana and Moylvos during the week  can be found dining on the weekends at Cafe Meze, which has Mediterranean-Italian food and decor, or at City Limits, which offers an Art Deco look, seating for 270 people and more than 70 menu items.</p>
        <p>The diner stands in the same spot where Livanos, which had pink marble decor and palm trees, stood. Livanos was full on weekends, but did not draw weekday crowds, Mr. Livanos said.</p>
        <p>It was the first white-tablecloth venture for John Livanos, who had previously owned luncheonettes and dinners in Brooklyn and Queens. As a young man, he came to this country from Lesbos Island off Greece; now the Livanos Restaurant Group grosses $16 million.</p>
        <p>Building his business meant that Mr. Livanos had to stay tuned to changes in the dining scene. For instance, he noted that late-night dining is down while earlier meals are up. ''People are bringing their kids out to eat with them,'' he said, speculating that this was a big reason for the change.</p>
        <p>He thinks that explains the popularity of the City Limits Diner on Central Avenue. Adults can choose grilled fish, while their youngsters wolf down French fries and malteds. Health consciousness is still a factor.</p>
        <p>Still, he noted: ''Some grown-ups want their comfort foods too. We do sell cheeseburgers to adults too.''</p>
