        <p>THE once-dominant Onteora Indians high school football team sank so low that it did not even play one recent season. Seeking to stoke athletic prowess in 1997, boosters painted a mural in the gym of a tomahawk-wielding Indian, with war paint, bulging muscles and gritted teeth, bursting through a brick wall. The team is still struggling, but the Indian seems to have turned everyone else here into warriors.</p>
        <p>If the New York race for Senate is a soap opera, the Onteora school board race is the World Wrestling Federation. Body slamming has broken out in Woodstock and surrounding Ulster County towns that share the high school. One side sees the Indian mascot as a racist stereotype; the other sees a symbol of local pride under attack by the political correctness militia.</p>
        <p>There are accusations of flattened car tires, swiped campaign signs and telephone threats. Police reports have been filed, and Justice Department mediators have been called in to ease tensions. School board meetings have gotten loud and ugly, with words like ''racists'' and ''freaks'' flying freely. About 700 people have signed petitions demanding the ouster of the superintendent of the mainly white school district, Hal Rowe, who calls the mascot ''institutional racism.'' Joseph Doan, a board member who supports the mascot and coaches baseball, said a woman took her son off his team in protest.</p>
        <p>In Tuesday's school board election, there are two competing slates, one favoring the mascot, one opposing it. ''I don't say this pejoratively,'' Donna Boundy, an educational writer and antimascot candidate, said of the other side's mind-set, ''but it's less intellectual, more Reaganesque.''</p>
        <p>Fred Perry, a corrections officer and pro-mascot candidate, said: ''The Indian head is on a new silver dollar. Is that wrong?'' He added, ''Forty-nine years it was not a problem, and then you have these strange-looking Rastafarians coming in cursing.''</p>
        <p>Presumably Mr. Perry is referring to members of Color, a group of interracial families in Woodstock who asked that the board remove the mural. To their surprise, the board voted 4 to 3 in January to phase out the Indian name, beginning next school year. It was the first shot of this culture war in the Catskills.</p>
        <p>''I don't think it's appropriate for four people to reverse 50 years of history,'' said Martin Millman, the board president.</p>
        <p>Indian mascots are controversial elsewhere, but here, at least, the fight is less about Indians than about who rules.</p>
        <p>Woodstock is, well, Woodstock, and much of the rest of the school district consists of rural towns where it is not quite as easy to find a good tofu burrito. Hundreds of people have attended recent board meetings seeking to undo the vote. Mr. Millman said he proposed removing the mural yet retaining the name, but opponents would not budge.</p>
        <p>Thomas Rosato, a board member, said he opposed the mascot after realizing that Indian symbols were as sacred as a crucifix or Star of David. ''They're flesh-and-blood human beings,'' he said of Indians. ''They're still alive. They work, they have families, they're our neighbors, and they're telling us they're not honored by this.''</p>
        <p>The other side was expressed by a man at an auto supply store in the hamlet of Phoenicia. ''It's not worse than Vikings or Spartans or Trojans,'' he said, insisting on not being identified. ''This all existed. What kind of society is this if we suppress reality?''</p>
        <p>Dennis Yerry, a musician and one of the few people with Indian blood involved in the dispute, objected to the mural a few years ago. To him, the mascot is typical of the white man's odd relationship with Indians. ''My idea is when you come to an area and wipe out all the trees and deer, you then call it Deer Lane,'' he said. Onteora, he said, is a  name a white man invented in the 1800's.</p>
        <p>But Onteora High is ''Indian'' territory. There is a totem pole painted on the cafeteria wall, the school's coat of arms has three dancing Indians, and the spring social event is the Tomahawk Dance. In a straw poll students strongly favored the mascot, but student leaders are considering other names -- the Thundercats, the Storm. They are overlooking the obvious local symbol of unleashed ferocity. How about the Battlin' Board Members of Onteora High? Fight, team, fight!</p>
