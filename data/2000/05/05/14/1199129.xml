        <p>Rick Lyman reports on Los Angeles's Grand Central Market, where the 'whole diverse ethnic stew' of city comes together (Special section The Sophisticated Traveler) (Part 2 of 2-part section) (M)</p>

        <p>A man on Rollerblades, muscular, totally bald, came zipping around the corner near a fish taco stand and almost ran down a very old and frail-looking woman carrying a bag full of avocados and freshly cooked tortillas. She yelled at him in Spanish and he shrugged and kept on rolling.</p>
        <p>This encounter takes place in the Grand Central Market, where the whole diverse ethnic stew of Los Angeles comes together. Sprawling between Broadway and Hill Street in the heart of old, litter-strewn downtown, it is -- let's be honest -- a little seedy. Just across the street is the famed Bradbury Building, where some key scenes of Ridley Scott's ''Blade Runner,'' set in a futuristic, hellish Los Angeles, were filmed. A visit to the market only feeds a sense of ethnic richness meeting urban decay in near collision.</p>

        <p>This encounter takes place in the Grand Central Market, where the whole diverse ethnic stew of Los Angeles comes together. Sprawling between Broadway and Hill Street in the heart of old, litter-strewn downtown, it is -- let's be honest -- a little seedy. Just across the street is the famed Bradbury Building, where some key scenes of Ridley Scott's ''Blade Runner,'' set in a futuristic, hellish Los Angeles, were filmed. A visit to the market only feeds a sense of ethnic richness meeting urban decay in near collision.</p>
        <p>The market has been in operation since 1917 and still maintains a sense of days gone by. Do not expect gourmet cuts of meat or even the finest produce, unless you get there early, and even then, who knows? But the show cannot be beat. It's the real Los Angeles, in a nutshell. And you can buy almost anything wrapped in a tortilla. Hog maw? Of course. Tripe? Naturally. Brains? If you must.</p>
        <p>Roasts To Go, a taco and burrito stall in the center aisle, is a good bet; or maybe Sarita's Pupuseria, serving delicious Salvadoran pupusas filled with beans and pork, on the aisle just to the right of the main entrance. You can stuff yourself for $3. The market also has some of the most succulent fish tacos north of Baja. The dominant aromas are Latin, but there are dozens of food booths scattered amid the fresh produce and butcher stalls, offering everything from Vietnamese pho bowls to Chinese soups. You won't actually spot Harrison Ford chasing androids between the steamy stalls, but it's not much of a stretch to imagine it.</p>
