        <p>THE red awning outside Commune, night life's lastest crush, says, ''Eat, Drink and Be Merry.'' A few other exhortations the management might want to consider adding:</p>
        <p>''Wear skintight dresses.''</p>
        <p>''Communicate only by cell phone.''</p>
        <p>''Stagger into the street drunk.''</p>
        <p>''Arrive in white stretch limousines.''</p>
        <p>I have witnessed all of these things. It is impossible not to. I live across the street. My once-quiet, broad, tree-lined stretch of East 22nd Street, in the shadow of the Flatiron Building, has become hot hot hot -- ever since a restaurant called Commune opened last month.</p>
        <p>Commune's premiere party for ''The Virgin Suicides'' drew Sofia Coppola, Spike Jonze, Kirsten Dunst, Eddie Vedder, David Crosby, Rachel Hunter, Matt Dillon, Nathasha Lyonne, Gina Gershon, Shalom Harlow and Damien Loeb. At a Vanity Fair bash, Park Avenue princesses frolicked at the expense of the sponsor, Evian.</p>
        <p>Sadly, I have misspent much of my adult life in search of just this kind of heat. Now that it's right there in front of me, I want no part of it. Not in my backyard, as the suburbanites say. It took years to get Rascals (''The Original Restaurant,'' as its sign boasted) out of the same premises. Now this?</p>
        <p>My first Commune experience was a post-premiere dinner for the movie ''Me, Myself, I,'' on a windy evening in late March. The place was still in the soft-opening phase, with the advance hype and gossip-column coverage being masterminded by the publicist Lizzie Grubman. Her efforts were aided by Matthew Kenney, a chef known for being both pretty good and pretty good-looking. He's also the night-life-friendly toque behind Canteen, in SoHo.</p>
        <p>My friend and I got to the party early, having skipped the screening. We climbed into stools at the large communal table in the middle of the restaurant and ordered drinks. Beautiful people filtered in. Rachel Griffiths, the movie's Australian star. Serena Altshul of MVT. Half of the Sykes sisters.</p>
        <p>For the dinner, we relocated to a small table in the front and devoured our lobster appetizer, free-range rubber chicken and tasty dessert. The edibility of this basic banquet food showed promise for the kitchen. I imagined myself becoming a Commune regular, hunkering down two or three nights a week in my usual booth, putting my name on a few obscure wines in the cellar. Working my connections -- a very pleasant deputy of Mr. Kenney's who lives in my building -- I secured a table for opening night.</p>
        <p>Two weeks later, I was standing at the reservation desk offering my name to the gazelles employed as the restaurant's hostesses. One of them led us to a banquette on the back wall, next to the fireplace. In light coal miners would not envy, we squinted at the menu and shouted at each other over the rising din. About halfway through our smoked pork chops and tuna tartare, a black scrim descended from the ceiling, bisecting the restaurant. Suddenly, we were in a clubby V.I.P. zone. That's when the high-fiving started among thick-necked young men who looked as if they had paid tolls to get there. It was either too early or too late for actual V.I.P.'s. In their place, junior ''Sopranos'' types sized up one another's hair gel as their cantilevered dates tiptoed around hiking up handkerchief-size tops. I wondered how many were paying customers.</p>
        <p>In the coed sink area between the men's and ladies' rooms, a couple engaged in what Page Six might call serious canoodling. It was time to go.</p>
        <p>A week later, some out-of-towner friends wanted to see the place. My idea, actually: the lazy choice. It was late on a Saturday night, Easter weekend. ''Ben-Hur'' was on, and I could catch the end of the chariot race if I didn't have to go farther than my front door to meet them. When I showed up, about 11:05, they were already being rebuffed.</p>
        <p>''The bar is full,'' the gazelle on duty that night was saying. ''I'm afraid we can't accommodate you.''</p>
        <p>''That's outrageous!'' This was my old high-school friend, an entertainment lawyer not accustomed to refusals.</p>
        <p>I walked past the altercation to the  manager, a man of professional wrestler dimensions. I'd made contact with him at the ''Me, Myself, I'' party. He waved us all in and we huddled around a few square inches of bar space. Again, no signs of fabulousness, even with two major modeling agencies just a block away. This is, of course, the dirty little secret of It clubs. Most of the time, they're filled with nobodies. We didn't finish our drinks.</p>
        <p>Since then, I've almost gone back twice. I walked in after work the other day, thinking I'd have a beer and finish reading a magazine at the bar. But a) the bar crowd was already two suits deep, and b) the lighting had already been dimmed to lunar eclipse level. The other time was a failed attempt at a post-party nightcap. We got there at 1:05 and were told the club had stopped letting people in. I assumed that was a selective rule that would not have applied to, say, Lenny Kravitz. Then I remembered that I might have been indirectly responsible for the policy.</p>
        <p>The 1 a.m. cutoff on Saturday nights was worked out with Community Board 5, with the support of our co-op board, of which I am a member. (Actually, only the kitchen closes at 1, but who's counting?) Board 5 also refused a request to expand Commune's outdoor cafe area over more of the sidewalk. This request had seemed particularly nervy to me. The restaurant just got here and already it wants to cordon off public space? I was incensed. Not mad enough to attend a five-hour community board meeting, but enough to bore anyone who would listen to my harangue.</p>
        <p>Noise is the classic complaint from neighbors of clubs. The other day, a woman in the elevator told me it was keeping her awake all the way up on the 10th floor.</p>
        <p>My windows are on the other side of the building, so the late-night racket is not my problem with Commune. The problem is being over 30, and not in the meat market, and not wanting to see white stretch limos and sweaty suits stumbling onto the street where I live. I thank Commune for helping me get over the Scene. I'm also counting on the scene makers' limited attention spans to send them away in search of somewhere hotter and with nicer neighbors.</p>
