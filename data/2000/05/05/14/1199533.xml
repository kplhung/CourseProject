        <p>Scott Stevens is an 18-year veteran and Brian Rafalski is a rookie, and they work well as a pair on the Devils' defense. Their experience differential is not the only contrast that makes them an odd couple of roommates during the Stanley Cup playoffs.</p>
        <p>On the night before a game, Rafalski prefers to relax by watching television shows like ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' because, he said, ''I get sick of watching hockey games every single night.''</p>
        <p>His roommate has different preferences.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes, I have to say, 'Scotty, we're just not going to watch another game,' '' Rafalski said. ''He'll come up and point at the TV and say: 'This guy should have done this! That guy should have done that!' He gets into it and then he's all wound up and then it's hard to get him to sleep.''</p>
        <p>Stevens laughed when he heard this tale. ''He's right,'' Stevens said. ''Brian is pretty calm and cool. I probably watch hockey a little too much and get caught up in it.''</p>
        <p>In deference to Rafalski, Stevens has been using the players' recreation room at the hotel to watch only two periods. ''Otherwise,'' Stevens said, ''I'm too wound up.''</p>
        <p>The Devils hope both men rested well last night -- despite the telecast of the Colorado-Dallas game -- because New Jersey plays at 3 p.m. today in Philadelphia in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals. Stevens, the 36-year-old captain, was the team's central figure in the first two rounds, a four-game sweep of Florida and a six-game ouster of Toronto. He keyed on stopping Pavel Bure of the Panthers and the combination of Mats Sundin and Steve Thomas of the Maple Leafs.</p>
        <p>Against the Flyers, his assignment will be more diffuse because Eric Lindros, a big center, is out with post-concussion symptoms, and Keith Primeau, another big center, is doubtful because of a concussion. But forwards like John LeClair and Mark Recchi are dangerous in different ways. As a group, the Flyers are bigger and more rugged than the Devils' previous two opponents.</p>
        <p>At 6 feet 1 inch and a sturdy 215 pounds, Stevens has led the Devils with clean, solid body checks, many of them in open ice. Despite this, he has only 4 penalty minutes in 10 games because he has turned down invitations to extend hostilities beyond the whistles of officials, sometimes skating backward with a tight smile above his goatee as rival players taunt and challenge him. This is remarkable for a man who got 283 penalty minutes one season in his younger days with Washington.</p>
        <p>''He's got maybe a bit of a temper, sometimes,'' said Scott Niedermayer, another Devils defenseman. ''Right now, he's really got that under control. It takes a lot of discipline.''</p>
        <p>Restraint like this will be especially important against a Philadelphia team that is among the National Hockey League's roughest. Ken Daneyko, another hard-hitting Devils defenseman, said Stevens is ''like a shark who smells blood'' and ''has been our physical and emotional leader.''</p>
        <p>Stevens, Daneyko and Niedermayer were Devils in 1995, when the team won its only Stanley Cup. In recent years, the Devils have made early playoff exits after good regular seasons.</p>
        <p>''I know this year is very important to him,'' Daneyko said of Stevens, ''because it's been a tough few years and he has taken a lot of it to heart and some of the heat. He's taken some flak about leadership and about maybe the way he's played in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''We've played well of late, and Scott Stevens deserves all the credit in the world. He's been a real dominant force. We have followed him. He has lifted us.''</p>
        <p>Stevens has been a Devil since 1991 and the captain since 1992. As a veteran with talent and free-agent leverage, he might have made more money elsewhere, on a team with a higher profile. But he chose to stay and work for Lou Lamoriello, a general manager known for tight budgets and strict control of employees.</p>
        <p>Earning $4.152 million a season in the second year of a four-year contract, Stevens might be getting less than he could. Why did he choose to stay? ''I like the system, I like the team, I like the travel,'' Stevens said. ''I've learned a lot playing here. My kids are in school and doing very well. I'm very happy with that, and that is important to me. I don't think it's worth moving your children.''</p>
        <p>He and his wife, Donna, have three children under the age of 11. John Hauser, Stevens's Washington-based agent, said, ''Money was important to Scott, but he did not want to end up on a team and in a city where it was unknown how his family would react to the town and the schools.''</p>
        <p>There is some risk, Hauser added, when ''you take the flower out of the garden and attempt to transplant it.'' Hauser also said that Stevens knew that with the Devils he would have a chance to compete for the Stanley Cup every spring.</p>
        <p>Lamoriello, rarely one to gush about those who work for him, said Stevens was a valuable example to teammates both on and off the ice. ''He eats right, he sleeps right, he works hard,'' Lamoriello said. ''I don't think you'll see Scott Stevens go to a fast-food restaurant often. He takes care of himself. It's not by accident that he plays the way he does and sustains it night in and night out. He is, without question, one of the elite players in the N.H.L.''</p>
        <p>Stevens said he tried to stay away from sweets and other dubious food. Stevens has played in more than 95 percent of the Devils' games since joining the team. Referring to Lamoriello, Stevens said: ''Lou likes hard-working people and gritty guys who come to play. The blue-collar type of hockey player.''</p>
        <p>Stevens may also have benefited from playing with Rafalski, who is quick and nimble and experienced from four professional seasons in Scandinavia and four before that at the University of Wisconsin. ''He knows if he steps up, I'll be back there,'' Rafalski said. ''It allows him to be more active at the blue line. He reads me pretty well.''</p>
        <p>Although not known as an offensive attacker, Stevens has two goals and four assists for 6 points in the playoffs, tied for third on the team. Larry Robinson, who replaced Robbie Ftorek as coach with eight games left in the season, said Stevens and other Devils became too attack-oriented during the regular season. Robinson has refocused Stevens's attention ''on doing the things that you do well,'' such as checking and positional defense.</p>
        <p>''Having said that, Scotty got us some big goals in the first series and made some great offensive plays in the last series,'' Robinson said. ''He's playing very intelligently. He's really taken the leadership role and gone with it. He has shown by example.''</p>
        <p>Niedermayer said that Stevens ''is not the most vocal guy around'' but that he will speak to teammates when necessary. ''The biggest thing is how hard he plays all the time,'' Niedermayer said. ''If you can't see that, your eyes aren't open.''</p>
        <p>No longer the wide-eyed kid who broke into the N.H.L. with the Capitals in 1982, Stevens speaks now as if he has his eyes on the prize. Comparing the Devils of 2000 with the champions of 1995, Stevens said: ''We're similar. We're a close bunch of guys. We're a focused and disciplined hockey team.''</p>
        <p>Stevens added: ''It's the final four. It is pretty prestigious and very exciting. We've eliminated a lot of those past doubts and failures. We've won two big rounds. We're playing great hockey. We're going to try and grab the next round. The stakes get higher and higher now.''</p>
