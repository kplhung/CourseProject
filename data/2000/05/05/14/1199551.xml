        <p>Houses tell the stories of people who have loved and suffered there, done their work and moved on.</p>
        <p>But few houses tell them as eloquently and insistently as the white Victorian with the gauzy curtains at the windows, shutters a bit askew and tall hedges out front where Carson McCullers, literary prodigy and tortured invalid, lived for nearly half her 50 years.</p>
        <p>With McCullers's death in 1967, of a brain hemorrhage, the house might have been turned into a museum, like Edward Hopper's childhood home down the street. Instead, it lives on as an artists' colony, a miniature Yaddo, which reverberates with the spirit of its longtime owner.</p>
        <p>Its five apartments are home to a performance artist, a sculptor, an essayist and two poets, who know that they are keepers of the flame. In fact, two of them, Constance DeJong, the performance artist, and Jeanne Atkin, the sculptor, have explicitly honored McCullers's memory by collaborating on an art exhibit, which opened on May 6 at the Hopper Art Center here.</p>
        <p>The decision to subdivide McCullers's house into apartments -- work that her friend Tennessee Williams paid for -- was made while the author was still alive but struggling with extraordinary medical bills from a rheumatic heart, a series of crippling strokes, cancer, cardiac failure and repeated onslaughts of pneumonia.</p>
        <p>But the decision to continue renting the apartments after her death, first to ordinary tenants and eventually to artists and writers, was made by Dr. Mary Mercer, who was McCullers's psychiatrist at a critical time in her stormy life and gradually became her protector and closest friend. Theirs was an improbable bond, breaking all the rules of psychotherapy, but one both women described as the most significant and loving of their lives.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mercer, who is nearing her 90th birthday, bought 131 South Broadway from the McCullers estate in 1968 lest she walk by one day and ''discover the hedges cut down and the house painted purple.'' To her, it is a shrine.</p>
        <p>''I care more about the house than the tenants,'' she said, without apology, during an interview at her own Nyack home, on a bluff overlooking the Tappan Zee Bridge. It is in the psychiatrist's house that McCullers, after a lengthy writer's block, wrote her final novel, ''Clock Without Hands,'' published in 1961.</p>
        <p>At 131 South Broadway, a sketch of the author, with elfin face and haunted eyes, hangs in the foyer. A plaque outside quotes the most famous McCullers line, ''They are the we of me,'' from ''The Member of the Wedding.''</p>
        <p>The garden, which slopes east toward the Hudson River, was planted this spring with viburnum, mountain laurel and 15 varieties of hostas and opened to literary pilgrims, who come here to visit the author's grave at Oak Hill Cemetery, also the resting place of Helen Hayes and Ben Hecht.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mercer refers to the tenants as ''Carson's guests.'' That is both an inspiration and a burden for Ms. DeJong and Ms. Atkin, the two full-time artists in the house, as well as for Sandrea DeMinco, a college librarian who writes essays; Carol Gannet, a social worker and poet; and Kevin Quinn, a teacher who also writes poetry.</p>
        <p>Winning an apartment at 131 South Broadway, a choice location in a Rockland County village that has recently added Rosie O'Donnell and Jonathan Demme to its roster of celebrity residents, requires a series of challenging interviews with Dr. Mercer. She is a larger-than-life character in her own right, who quotes Sophocles and Goethe in ordinary conversation and is rarely seen without her signature strand of pearls.</p>
        <p>The interviews are not a formal test, but prospective renters are queried on which works of McCullers they have read and what they know about the author, whom Dr. Mercer and the tenants always refer to as Carson, as if there could be only one person who answered to that name.</p>
        <p>Ms. DeJong, 52, was the first artist in residence, here for 10 years and more cynical than the rest about the aura of the house. She recalled a newspaper interview around the time she moved here, related to a theater piece she had just completed. Ms. DeJong was afraid that the interviewer would focus on McCullers's work and not her own.</p>
        <p>''It's easy to be hijacked by the mystery, the mythology,'' Ms. DeJong said. Still, she said, ''I had read everything'' long ago.</p>
        <p>''Women do read her at a certain age,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. DeMinco, 51, came next, seven years ago, having read ''The Ballad of the Sad Cafe'' during her ''sojourner summer between high school and college.'' Reverently, she has since worked her way through the complete McCullers oeuvre, including film adaptations, biographies and Web sites devoted to her work.</p>
        <p>Ms. DeMinco has produced three essays since moving here. They are her first published works. ''I believe her spirit permeates everything,'' Ms. DeMinco wrote in Tea for One, a local literary journal. ''And if I'm very, very conscientious and respectful, it will visit me.''</p>
        <p>Next came Ms. Atkin, 40, who moved in half a dozen years ago. Her first exposure to McCullers was a movie version of ''The Member of the Wedding,'' which she watched on television the night she moved into her first apartment, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, poised at the tender age of 18 to cast herself as a bohemian.</p>
        <p>Ms. Atkin was working at a bookstore and bought all the McCullers books using her employee discount. More recently, at the Nyack Public Library, she has seen photographs of Marilyn Monroe, Tennessee Williams and Isak Dinesen, all friends of the author, in what is now Ms. Atkin's living room.</p>
        <p>The tenants understand that their ''hostess'' was a prodigy who published ''The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter'' at 23, a hopeless romantic who twice married the same alcoholic man, a woman whose bisexuality was an open secret and who worked and lived hard, despite illnesses worthy of Job.</p>
        <p>''She throbbed,'' said Ms. Atkin, who lives in the spacious ground-floor apartment with the screened sleeping porch where McCullers spent her last few years, mostly bedridden. It was here that the frail author, wrapped in a Persian dressing gown, dictated her unfinished autobiography, ''Illumination and Night Glare,'' which was published last year.</p>
        <p>Ms. DeJong, who describes herself as ''a person of language,'' makes her home in the attic apartment, tucked beneath the slate-covered mansard roof, where McCullers lived briefly with her husband, Reeves, during their second try at marriage. Later he would kill himself in Paris, after she refused a joint suicide.</p>
        <p>Biographers credit Dr. Mercer with keeping McCullers alive for an extra 10 years by managing her medical care and looking after her psyche. They were heady times for the psychiatrist, who traveled with McCullers and met her famous friends. Dr. Mercer still speaks of her in the present tense and shows a visitor the author's silver-topped cane.</p>
        <p>Dr. Mercer wants the tenants to identify with McCullers's passionate, heedless nature. When Ms. DeMinco first looked at her apartment, she worried that the 3-by-4-foot kitchen would be inadequate for someone who loved to cook and owned 100 cookbooks.</p>
        <p>But Dr. Mercer said, '' 'Let your work feed you,' '' Ms. DeMinco recalled. She also noted that the apartment had no closet, just three pegs for garments. ''Don't worry about the tangibles,'' Dr. Mercer said.</p>
        <p>Ms. DeMinco got rid of three-quarters of her cookbooks. She had a cherry-wood cabinet built for her clothes. Dr. Mercer reviews her unpublished manuscripts. From a cozy window seat, facing the river, she looks out on blossoming dogwood, cherry and magnolia trees, the last a gift to McCullers from the artist Henry Varnum Poor. Ms. DeMinco swoons at her good fortune.</p>
        <p>Ms. Atkin has the hardest time escaping the ghosts because she lives in the Apartment, as her housemates call it. When she moved in, 27 years after McCullers's death, the curling wallpaper was unchanged. When Dr. Mercer called her ''Carson's guest,'' she knew the landlady spoke from love and memory and meant no harm. Still, she did not want to feel like an afterthought.</p>
        <p>Ms. Atkin made her own imprint with the candlesticks, menorahs, napkin rings and hair sticks that she designs in pewter and aluminum, several for sale in the Museum of Modern Art catalog. Her dog, Delilah, romps through the sunny space.</p>
        <p>''I do love her as a writer,'' Ms. Atkin said. ''But I also have my own life, in my own house.''</p>
        <p>It is a sentiment that McCullers, a transplanted Southerner, might well have shared. She moved here with her mother in 1945, after her father's death, and never looked back. ''I was always homesick for a place I had never seen, and now I have found it,'' she wrote. ''It is here, this house, this town.''</p>
