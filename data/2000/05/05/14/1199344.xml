        <p>A BACKYARD mixed with a little imagination can be one of the wonders of the world.</p>
        <p>It can be a dinosaur nest, an English garden fit for a tea party, the scene of a Star Wars battle or the main stage for your very own summer camp.</p>
        <p>It doesn't take parents too long to discover that while it's wonderful to take children on adventures at the beach or pool or park, sometimes the packing can take as long as the playing.</p>
        <p>So, for many families, a big part of summer fun takes place right out the back door.</p>
        <p>''We have a really great time in the yard,'' said Sharyn Pepe, a Pitman mother of two. ''We've done everything from steppingstones to parties.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Pepe, a former commercial artist, has come up with plenty of projects that involve the outdoors and the garden. She has had Kathryn, 5, and Madelyn, 1, make steppingstones with their friends by mixing concrete and pouring it into inexpensive pie pans. Before the mixture sets, the children can put in their hand prints and decorate with stones or shiny objects.</p>
        <p>They have also bought flowerpots and painted them before filling them with soil and flowers.</p>
        <p>A tea party is another favorite way to spend a day, making little sandwiches, cakes and iced tea before heading into the yard for the gathering.</p>
        <p>Last summer, the family bought plastic eggs and rolled them in glue and then sand.  When they dried, they became dinosaur eggs. Parents and children could hide them in the yard and then have a hunt.</p>
        <p>''We had a dinosaur nest, and you had to run your egg back to the nest when you found it,'' Ms. Pepe said.</p>
        <p>The backyard is also the perfect place for those messy activities that can be a recipe for disaster in the house. Robin McManus of Haddonfield and her three children tie-dye in the yard every summer. They fill empty ketchup bottles with dye, roll up shirts and squirt away.</p>
        <p>''We dye anything that's white,'' Ms. McManus said. ''They hunt in their closets for white stuff. We've dyed socks, shirts and sheets.'' One year, they made T-shirts as end-of-the year teacher gifts.</p>
        <p>And don't underestimate the fun of a plastic baby pool or the sprinkler. Ms. McManus said her children loved it when she turned on the sprinkler system in the yard and they could run from spigot to spigot getting a squirt. Lemonade stands, making ice pops from juice and looking for butterflies near the butterfly bush are also favorite pastimes, she said.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the old-fashioned things are what kids like to do.''</p>
        <p>Time to simply hang out in the yard is also important.</p>
        <p>Today's overbooked children really need time to just play, said Dr. Paul Booker, a Camden County psychologist in private practice. ''Children learn through play, and cognitive development does take place through play,'' he said. ''Children are active experimenters.''</p>
        <p>Even the give and take with the children in the neighborhood is part of learning and growing, Dr. Booker said. ''Cooperation, sharing and self-control and an opportunity to solve emotional problems'' can all take place in the yard, he said.</p>
        <p>Jennifer Gregory, a mother of four in Audubon has found that the big wooden play set in her yard is where children of all ages can play, imagine and interact. They had the set built a year ago with a tower, a tunnel slide, a rope ladder, a fireman's pole and swings.</p>
        <p>''They do all types of imaginative things,'' Ms. Gregory said. ''They play Star Wars and use the play set as a fort. Before, it was always chaotic getting the kids to the park. Now, they can play when they want.''</p>
        <p>A backyard camp is another way to offer activities without packing up and getting into the car. Jane Lee and her Glen Ridge neighbors set up a five-day camp last summer for 10 children. Each of the five families was in charge of one day, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. The hosts picked a theme.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lee and her daughters were hosts of a space exploration day. They painted a refrigerator box and made it look like a rocket ship. Children made Martian ears out of head bands and everyone learned about outer space. Another neighbor held a treasure hunt that was part of ''manners day.''  Children had to be polite while going around the neighborhood and asking for items.</p>
        <p>''It was just five families banding together and doing it and they had a wonderful time,'' Ms. Lee said.</p>
        <p>For the past three summers, sisters named Alexandra and Jill Saputelli and their friend Colleen Macbride have run a camp for Luke Saputelli, 7, and his friends. It has included roller hockey, soccer, basketball and other sports activities. The cost is $10 for the week to cover supplies and candy and it runs from 4 to 6 p.m.</p>
        <p>''They buy tons of candy at the Wawa because they know kids respond to rewards,'' said their mother, Linda Saputelli,  who donates her yard in Moorestown for the project and often plays host to the other parents on the last day when the children get awards and certificates. Children have been rewarded for being most improved, most cheerful and most helpful.</p>
        <p>On summer evenings, when the sprinklers have been turned off and all the toys have been put away, the backyard can be a restful place to kick back and enjoy lightning bugs and the stars.</p>
        <p>''You need a place you can go for solitude and to remember what is important,'' said Ms. Pepe. ''That's what the backyard is for us. It's time to remember the small things.''</p>
