        <p>AS soon as we put a hole in the ground, we sell the house,'' said Jed Schutz, one of the developers of White Street Commons, a 13-house subdivision going up in the village of Southampton where seven houses have been sold or are under contract.</p>
        <p>Most of the buyers at White Street Commons -- where the houses, on one-acre lots, cost from $1.5 million to $1.9 million -- are purchasing a vacation home. And the project's success illustrates both that the market for new houses in the Hamptons is extremely strong and that the demand is high for houses that are part of a new development.</p>
        <p>''There's absolutely a big market for houses in subdivisions,'' said Frank Newbold, a senior vice president of Sotheby's International Realty and head of its East Hampton office.</p>
        <p>The usual perception has been that vacation-home buyers would prefer houses on  isolated lots away from neighbors. ''I have customers who won't touch subdivisions because that's not what they come out here for,'' said Jay Flagg, manager of the Southampton office of Prudential Long Island Realty. ''But there are others who like being part of a neighborhood.''</p>
        <p>In fact, so many subdivisions were proposed for the town of Southampton last year that it recently imposed a six-month moratorium on processing subdivision applications for four or more lots until it can implement land-use recommendations contained in an update to its master plan. The update recommends preserving scenic vistas and additional farmland.</p>
        <p>A prime reason people buy in subdivisions, Mr. Newboldt said, rather than purchasing a single lot from a spot builder, is that ''buyers know that the quality of all the houses around them will be consistent.''</p>
        <p>Developers in the Hamptons go to great lengths to make buyers feel that they are purchasing a one-of-a-kind residence, even though it may be one of a group of houses being constructed by the same builder.</p>
        <p>''I think many people are misled by the word subdivision because subdivisions out here are not like the rows of houses that you find in many other places,'' said Michael DeSario, a vice president of the Cook Pony Farm real estate agency, which has seven offices on the East End.</p>
        <p>At White Street Commons, each house will have a different design. One is a 19th-century-style farmhouse with wraparound porches. Another resembles the classic estate houses of the East End. Another will be English country style. Charles Thomas of Riverhead is the architect of three of the houses, and Katherine Gormley of Manhattan has designed five and is working on a sixth.</p>
        <p>''You want a coherence, but you also want a diversity of architecture because people out here don't want to move into a cookie-cutter world,'' said Mr. Schutz, who is developing the 15-lot subdivision -- two buyers purchased double lots -- with his partner, Eric Friedlander. ''They want a unique product.'' Four houses are completed and four others -- one unsold -- are under construction.</p>
        <p>He, Mr. Friedlander and another partner, Carol Konner of Bridgehampton, are also bringing to market a 28-acre development in Water Mill called the Pasture at Mecox where 14 acres will be set aside as an agricultural preserve and 13 houses priced from $1.8 million to $2.7 million will be built on the remaining 14 acres. Houses will range from 4,200 square feet to 5,800 square feet and will have five or six bedrooms.</p>
        <p>The partners will also sell lots -- priced from $700,000 to $850,000 -- if buyers prefer to build a house on their own. In that case,  buyers must agree to abide by covenants and restrictions he is placing on the land, Mr. Schutz said. ''People want to know that if they are buying a beautiful $2.2 million house, someone is not going to build a 2,000-square-foot house right next door to them,'' he said. Lot buyers will have to build a house that is a minimum of 3,500 square feet with an estimated maximum of 6,500 square feet.  Other restrictions will require houses to have wood or slate roofs and to have traditional-style design consistent with architecture before 1920.</p>
        <p>ROBERT JESSUP, a developer with offices in Laurel, is building seven subdivision houses in Napeague, in the town of East Hampton between Amagansett and Montauk; each house will be designed by a different architect. The development, Beach Plum Park, is on 26 oceanfront acres, but the houses will be clustered on only eight acres with the remaining property, which includes 1,000 feet of oceanfront, to be left as a private preserve under the ownership of a homeowners association.</p>
        <p>''My houses may be close together, but they all work with each other and relate to each other,'' Mr. Jessup said. ''And because they are part of a subdivision, someone buying one of my houses will know they are not going to wind up with something dreadful next door.''</p>
        <p>The first of the houses, a five-bedroom, five-and-a-half bath contemporary designed by Alanson Rogers, a Westhampton architect, is under construction and is on the market for $4.5 million. Two other houses, one designed by Barnes Coy of Bridgehampton, the other by Kapell &amp; Kostow of Manhattan, are in the planning stages.</p>
        <p>Although each house will have a distinct look, there will be a unifying theme, Mr. Jessup said. Exteriors will be of cedar, mahogany and stone, to reflect the colors of  surrounding dunes and vegetation.</p>
        <p>Mr. DeSario of the Cook Pony Farm brokerage is also a partner of the Al X. Hamilton Partnership of East Hampton, which is developing a 24-lot subdivision called the Ranger Estate on 85 acres in East Hampton.  Of the 85 acres, 45 will be left as a preserve and donated to the town of East Hampton.  The houses, about 4,000 square feet each, will have one-and-a-half-acre lots. A homeowners association will own about two acres; two tennis courts are proposed.</p>
        <p>Construction of four houses designed by different architects will start within the next two months ''to set a good tone and establish the neighborhood so that buyers will know how the property is going to be developed,'' Mr. DeSario said. Lots will also be available, but covenants and restrictions will require architecture to resemble houses built before 1930. Houses must also have wood roofs and masonry chimneys. Lots are expected to cost about $400,000.</p>
        <p>Developers say that all too often there is haphazard development of lots that are not within subdivisions. ''One of the sad things about the Hamptons is that with all the emphasis on land conservation and clustering, no one in the planning departments pays any attention at all to architecture,'' said Harry Brown, president of the Brown Companies in Manhattan, a real estate investment company. ''Good design doesn't really cost more; it's just thoughtful.''</p>
        <p>The Brown Companies owns a 160-acre tract in Sagaponack that it has divided into a 40-lot subdivision called Eastwoods. The lots range from 1.5 to 2.5 acres. The rest of the property will become a preserve. The towns of East Hampton and Southampton require that from 50 to 65 percent of land, depending on the site, be set aside as preserve areas.</p>
        <p>Houses will have an average size of 2,800 square feet and will be priced from $800,000 to $1.2 million. Lots will also be for sale -- the anticipated price is $250,000 each -- as long as buyers submit acceptable architectural plans, Mr. Brown said.</p>
        <p>Michael Braverman, an East Hampton developer, began selling a 12-lot subdivision in the Northwest Woods section of East Hampton a year ago. He has already sold 10 of the lots, which range in size from 1.5 to two acres. The remaining two lots are on the market for $255,000 each.</p>
        <p>Hilltops, as the subdivision is called, has a total of 44 acres, of which 22 will remain undeveloped; 1.5 acres will be owned by a homeowners association, which can elect to build a tennis court.</p>
        <p>''People buy here because they know what's going to happen around them,'' Mr. Braverman said. ''I reserve the right to approve any plans, and we give guidelines.''  The minimum size of a house is 2,900 square feet, traditional architecture is required, decks must be in the back and garages cannot face the street. When completed, houses will have a value in the $800,000 range, Mr. Braverman said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Braverman, among others, anticipates that upzoning being considered by the towns of East Hampton and Southampton, which could result in requirements that  building lots be at least five acres, could spell the end to large subdivisions there.</p>
        <p>Upzoning ''will make it much more difficult and much more expensive to subdivide, and also there are not that many large parcels left,'' Mr. Braverman said.</p>
        <p>George Kamper, the owner of Creative Carpentry, a Southampton building company, said that land preservation pressures are already increasing demand for subdivisions that are currently on the market.</p>
        <p>''If something is running out, like gasoline,'' he said, ''then everyone runs to the person who still has some.''</p>
