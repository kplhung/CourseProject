        <p>A SORT of dream sequence of works -- Berlioz's ''Symphonie Fantastique,'' Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto and John Corigliano's ''Three Hallucinations'' -- has been chosen by the New Haven Symphony music director Jung-Ho Pak for the symphony's season finale on Thursday evening at Yale.</p>
        <p>The theme is clear. ''On the one hand you have Berlioz, his musical imagination is extremely revolutionary for his time,'' said Mr. Pak in a telephone interview from San Diego, where he also directs that city's symphony. ''You can hear it in his musical ideas, his orchestration; the size of the orchestra is humongous for that era.''</p>

        <p>A SORT of dream sequence of works -- Berlioz's ''Symphonie Fantastique,'' Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto and John Corigliano's ''Three Hallucinations'' -- has been chosen by the New Haven Symphony music director Jung-Ho Pak for the symphony's season finale on Thursday evening at Yale.</p>
        <p>The theme is clear. ''On the one hand you have Berlioz, his musical imagination is extremely revolutionary for his time,'' said Mr. Pak in a telephone interview from San Diego, where he also directs that city's symphony. ''You can hear it in his musical ideas, his orchestration; the size of the orchestra is humongous for that era.''</p>
        <p>Then, Mr. Pak continued, ''you have John Corigliano's 'Three Hallucinations,' written in 1981, a visionary statement from the film 'Altered States.' I think it's different from what people normally think of his music. This has a bit more of an edge to it, it is more strongly evocative. Our audience will be more challenged with just enough dissonance and colorful orchestration.'' (Two pianos -- one on stage, another off stage and tuned  1/4 step down -- offer part of the challenge.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Corigliano, who is 62 years old, won an Academy Award on March 27 for the soundtrack of ''The Red Violin.'' Mr. Pak described ''Three Hallucinations'' as a difficult piece: ''It keeps me on my toes,'' he said. The first section, ''Sacrifice,'' depicts the  slaying of a seven-eyed goat. ''Hymn,'' the second section, has fragments of the hymn ''Rock of Ages,'' and ''Ritual'' is an Indian mushroom dance.</p>
        <p>Berlioz was known to indulge in opium, and some of his works, including the ''Symphonie Fantastique,'' are said to reflect the altered state deriving from that substance's use. Rey M. Longyear, the author of a book on romanticism in music, wrote that ''Berlioz paints a better picture of hell than any other composer.'' Indeed, the March to the Gallows scene in ''Symphonie Fantastique'' culminates with the chop of the guillotine, the head falling into the basket, and the cheers of the crowd. But the symphony's creation, said to have been inspired by a love obsession, led to a new idea in musical composition called idee fixe: a uniting, recurrent theme in all the work's movements.</p>
        <p>Mendelssohn's Violin Concerto has neither primitivist movements nor suggestions of science fiction; the closest the virtuoso showcase comes to having anything in common with the other two pieces on the program is that the violinist must be possessed and should come close to igniting the instrument with his or her playing. The guest violinist Chee-Yun will provide the dream connection for Mr. Pak. ''Chee-Yun is dreamy, a gorgeous violinist who plays with all her heart,'' Mr. Pak said. ''I enjoy working with her, and when you have a connection it is like a dream. Music making is a very intimate experience: when it's right it is very transfixing.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pak said that his approach to being a conductor is to be as communicative as possible. ''When I'm on stage, I try to draw the audience into what's going on on stage. I try to transport people. It takes a lot of work, but that is my goal. By putting a piece on like the Corigliano, this is to make the connection to the baby boom generation.''</p>
        <p>The concert program will also include a presentation of the symphony's first awards to music teachers. Educators from Cheshire, Guilford, Orange, North Haven and New Haven will be honored for their commitment to teaching music at the elementary, middle school and high school levels.</p>
        <p>The New Haven Symphony season finale is on Thursday evening at 7:30 p.m. at Woolsey Hall, Yale. The number to call for tickets ($15 to $48, $5 for students) is 203-776-1444 or 800-292-6476.</p>
