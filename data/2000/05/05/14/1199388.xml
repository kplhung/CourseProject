        <p>White Plains is considering a larger incentive package to entice Loews Cineplex Theaters back into the $125 million Town Center. The city originally offered Loews a $13 million investment in a $35 million parking garage and a 17-year property tax abatement package, said George D. Gretsas, chief of staff for Mayor Joseph M. Delfino. Mr. Gretsas would not say what kind of added incentives the city was considering. Earlier this spring, Loews said it was no longer interested in building a 21-screen, 5,100-seat movie theater in the Town Center, which is being developed by Tishman Speyer Properties. At the same time, Loews began negotiating to build a theater in Port Chester. Company officials, however, have assured White Plains that negotiations with Port Chester have nothing to do with its decision to pull out of the Tishman Speyer development, Mr. Gretsas said.</p>
