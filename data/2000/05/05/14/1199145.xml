        <p>THE MANY ASPECTS</p>
        <p>OF MOBILE HOME LIVING</p>
        <p>By Martin Clark.</p>
        <p>345 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Alfred A. Knopf. $24.</p>
        <p>It takes all of three paragraphs for a reader of Martin Clark's first novel to determine that the author, a circuit court judge in Virginia, has produced something other than a conventional legal thriller. That's when one arrives at this sentence: ''On the morning that Evers got his first glimpse of the albino mystery, he'd been walking into the sun, scraping down the sidewalk, burping up squalls of alcohol and two-in-the-morning microwave lasagna.'' Though courtroom intrigue figures into ''The Many Aspects of Mobile Home Living,'' temperamentally the novel owes far more to the canceled television sitcom ''Men Behaving Badly'' than to anything written by John Grisham.</p>
        <p>Like the author, the protagonist of this scruffily engaging tale, Evers Wheeling, is a judge in a small Southern town. From the sentence cited above onward, Clark challenges the reader to believe that such a man could hold any elected office, much less one that requires clearheaded dispassion. Evers Wheeling -- the very name connotes futility -- is an all-day boozer, a marijuana smoker and a slob, given to occasional racist musings and surreal non sequiturs such as, ''You ever notice how the pay phone cords look like a metal snake?'' When Wheeling learns that his wife has been cheating on him, he responds by tying her, naked, to an exit sign for the town of Climax, N.C. Much of his free time is spent in the mobile home of his seriously addled brother, Pascal; the judge describes the two of them as ''fatalistic dope smokers who've made giving up an art form.'' A kangaroo would make a more distinguished jurist.</p>
        <p>Into the torpor of Wheeling's life walks a mysterious young car saleswoman named Ruth Esther, who sheds opaque, or ''albino,'' tears. She offers the judge $25,000 if he'll find her brother not guilty of cocaine possession. Wheeling, of course, accepts the bribe (after strip-searching her in a pickup truck to see if she's wearing a wire). But Ruth Esther is rather like the white rabbit in ''Alice in Wonderland''; after he enters her world, Wheeling's proceeds to spin. It seems that her brother's real value is that he has clues about the whereabouts of a fortune their late father hid for them. Upon determining that the loot has been stashed in a safe deposit box in a Utah bank, a motley posse consisting of Judge Wheeling, Pascal, Ruth Esther, her impaired brother and her sharp-tongued African-American attorney, Pauletta Lightwren Qwai, heads westward. No sooner do they recover the cash than it is snatched up by Ruth Esther's brother and an accomplice. Ruth Esther is unruffled: of greater interest to her is a letter that she finds in the safe deposit box and refuses to show to the others. The letter's contents are subsumed into Ruth Esther's greater mystery, and Wheeling returns to North Carolina thinking himself neither better nor worse off for their acquaintanceship.</p>
        <p>He's wrong, naturally. Having preserved a few of her albino tears, Wheeling discovers that they seem to bring good fortune to those who gaze upon them. One of Wheeling's pothead friends wins the lottery; another falls into the possession of a vintage car. And when the judge wishes his unfaithful wife dead, poof! -- she winds up with a bullet in her skull. Unfortunately, Pascal stands accused of murdering her and, in keeping with the loopiness of the narrative, his confession to the crime is anything but straightforward.</p>
        <p>As plots go, Clark's ''thriller'' is as taut as cooked linguine, and at times the meandering pace seems deliberately irritating, like a Cheech and Chong routine. Additionally, the unyielding guy-ness of Wheeling and his cohorts is bound to put off some readers. At times, Clark depicts his protagonist as an arrested romantic: ''He enjoyed women more when he was 16 than when he was 39, and according to his wife this was his biggest problem in life.'' Elsewhere, though, he's merely boorish: ''It occurred to him that he had tried to have sex with almost every woman he had met since leaving his wife. He decided that this was healthy, correct, moral, just and sane.'' Rank infantilism is achieved in another scene, when the Wheeling brothers feed two kittens several laxatives and then stuff them inside the judge's wife's Lexus.</p>
        <p>Still, the author knows his guy. Like Nick Hornby in ''High Fidelity'' and Thomas McGuane in ''Nothing but Blue Skies,'' Clark has produced an oddly stirring portrait of a man in existential disarray, unable either to love or to hate with any competence -- until Ruth Esther's divine intervention jars him back to the land of the living. Evers Wheeling's charm is insidious, as Pauletta discovers. (Their unlikely romance lends the novel some much-needed crackle.) Intellectually expansive even when reeling from booze, bestowed with humility and insightfulness, he is, Clark might be suggesting, the best kind of judge society can hope for. For that matter, the justice meted out in ''The Many Aspects of Mobile Home Living'' is as crude and unfettered by legal niceties as its protagonist. Bad guys get away, good guys do rotten things and clarity takes a holiday. Albino tears and tied-up adultresses aside, the plausibility of Wheeling's odyssey mounts page by page. By the book's end -- which, cleverly but unsurprisingly, is in fact a beginning -- the judge has become a guy worth knowing, just in time for him to be whisked out of our sight.</p>
        <p>For those of us who write for a living, it's always appalling whenever someone sashays in from another walk of life and delivers the goods as Clark has here. In spare yet delightfully idiosyncratic prose, he captures a drowsy world of beaten dreamers, rendering their pathos and hilarity with the self-assuredness of a seasoned novelist. Time and again he teeters on the edge of silliness, only to balance the act with subtly affecting observations, such as: ''For all the years that Evers could recall, the Wheeling family had been more concerned with equilibrium than depth; not such a bad way to live, really.'' In this sense, he recalls Lewis Nordan and T. R. Pearson, two other Southern writers with a gift for elevating small-town vernacular in a way that isn't cloying or precious.</p>
        <p>Oh, and for what it's worth, the author struts his juridical expertise in several long courtroom scenes. Each is vivid and convincing, yet finally beside the point. ''The Many Aspects of Mobile Home Living'' is a guilty pleasure of an altogether different kind. Call it an illegal thriller.</p>
