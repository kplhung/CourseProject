        <p>William C. Ford Jr., chairman of Ford Motor and great-grandson of Henry Ford, acknowledged last week that sport utility vehicles, the automaker's most profitable products, might be as unsafe and environmentally damaging as critics say.</p>
        <p>His candor caused other corporate heirs to reflect that at times, the best interests of their families and companies require criticism of past practices. Roger Berkowitz empathized with Mr. Ford's awkward situation. His Legal Sea Foods restaurant chain recently took an environmental stand in promoting sustainable fishing practices. With the volume of fish he sells, some restaurant industry colleagues have called him hypocritical. ''I strongly endorse some of the moratoriums and quotas, even though it's a hard pill for family fisheries,'' Mr. Berkowitz said. ''It's the right thing to do down the road.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Berkowitz, whose grandfather founded Legal's Cash Market in 1904, said being up front on important issues goes along with being in a family business. ''He's talking about values,'' he said of Mr. Ford. ''You head a family where you try to teach your kids to do the right thing. As a family business, it's incumbent to do the right thing as well.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford's announcement didn't sound unreasonable to Robert W. Decherd, chairman of the A. H. Belo media company, whose family has been in the Texas newspaper business since before the automobile was invented.</p>
        <p>Mr. Decherd -- who has greatly expanded Belo and moderated the staunch conservatism of its flagship Dallas Morning News -- says he has never needed to criticize the company, or his family, in public. But because Belo is publicly owned, part of his job is addressing its long-term image. ''What I think about is our obligation to meet their expectations for the quality of our business and its long-term values,'' he said. ''That thought is ever present.''</p>
        <p>There is, of course, a difference between criticizing a business practice and digging into dirty laundry. A nasty family squabble over control of Legal Sea Foods, which made its way into the newspapers, ended in a rift between him and his brother, Marc Berkowitz. ''Really personal things,'' Roger Berkowitz said, ''should be kept private.''</p>
