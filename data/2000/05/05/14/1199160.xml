        <p>Like many teachers, when my young students can't think what to write, I sometimes suggest they retell a fairy tale. Update it, I say. Give it a new twist. This is an assignment of last resort, of course; I'd much rather they come up with something all their own. But every now and then a student reimagines a tale so completely that she might as well have written it herself. Retellings are popular in the picture-book world as well, but here, too, standouts are rare. Every generation has to newly illustrate the classics, I suppose, but I'm not sure why we feel the need to retell them. (They haven't stood the test of time for nothing.) Yet taking on a classic does require courage; comparisons are inevitable. Here are three illustrator-writers who take the challenge, with mixed results.</p>
        <p>''Froggie Went A-Courting,'' by Marjorie Priceman, reworks an old, familiar song, also known as ''Froggie Went A-Wooing.'' Various renditions exist, but all involve the courtship of a mouse by a frog. (In the well-known version illustrated by Randolph Caldecott, kittens gobble up the mouse and the cowardly frog runs off, only to meet his own end in the gullet of a swan.)</p>
        <p>Priceman is a fine and whimsical artist; I'm a fan. (She well deserved her Caldecott Honor Medal for ''Zin! Zin! Zin! A Violin!'') Her Froggie goes a-courting in New York City, and a touchingly besotted amphibian he is, a perfect match for the demure Ms. Mouse. Priceman's rich palette, sophisticated compositions and confidently casual strokes give the book warmth, energy and grace.</p>
        <p>Her retelling of the tale, however, is less satisfying. Not all the rhymes are as exacting as they should be in a read-aloud book (fourth/moth and cake/State), and her plot is too complicated for the ditty she gives us. By introducing an intolerant Auntie Rat who doesn't approve of interspecies marriage (''A slimy frog -- he's not our kind!''), she sets up possibilities she doesn't explore and expectations she doesn't quite meet.</p>
        <p>Still, the book has many pleasures, not the least of which is the cat licking its lips after making a meal of the bigoted aunt: ''Though cat ate rat, there's no denial, / Aunt Rat at last made someone smile.''</p>
        <p>If there is a more nearly perfect story in all the world than ''Henny-Penny,'' I would like to know what it is. ''The sky is falling! I must go and tell the king!'' The panicky chicken's origin among the English folk is centuries old, but simply substitute ''stock market'' for ''sky'' and ''Chairman Greenspan'' for ''king'' and you'll see how timeless Henny-Penny's folly is.</p>
        <p>Everything about Jane Wattenberg's ''Henny-Penny'' is overcharged, like a cartoon character who puts his finger in a socket -- yowza! She retells the tale in the kind of jive and bouncy lingo Robin Williams does so well: '' 'CHICKABUNGA!' squawked Henny-Penny in alarm. 'THE SKY IS FALLING! IT'S COMING ON DOWN!' ''Upon hearing this dire news, Cocky-Locky is eager to ''flap feathers and fly'' with Henny-Penny, who says, ''LET'S ROCKET, ROOSTER!'' And off they go, ''STEAMIN' to tell the king.'' Engaging as this language is, though, its manic energy sometimes upstages the story.</p>
        <p>To illustrate the mania, Wattenberg places photographs of real animals onto various landscapes in witty ways. The collages make a hyper-real world, like a television special effect, and although Wattenberg works hard to anthropomorphize her animals, there's only so much she can do. Real animals aren't human, and it's Henny-Penny's humanity that makes the story work. Fun as it may be to read, ''SHAKE, RATTLE and ROLL! THE SKY IS FALLING!,'' it's hard to believe the bird on the page is saying it.</p>
        <p>It's also hard to believe there ever was a time when people didn't know what Humpty Dumpty was, but this classic poem began as a riddle. Some scholars think it's thousands of years old, which means the Celts could have had the Romans scratching their heads over why Humpty couldn't be put together again.</p>
        <p>Humpty Dumpty has been rifled by writers before, most famously by Lewis Carroll in ''Through the Looking Glass.'' Carroll's absurd egg is still hilarious today, and so pompous that he well deserves the fate we know awaits him. Carroll found no moral in the poem, I think, but if the poem has one, it might be this: Some things in life can't be fixed. Milk spills. Cry all you want, there's nothing to be done.</p>
        <p>Not so in Daniel Kirk's retelling. His Humpty Dumpty is an enthusiastic egg so eager to see young King Moe's birthday parade that he climbs a wall for a better view. When he loses his balance and falls, shattering in front of the king, neither horses nor men can unscramble the pieces. (Kirk's Humpty Dumpty is apparently empty inside -- no yolk.) The boy-king cries until his mother encourages him to give it a go, and lo and behold, that which was broken is fixed, and Humpty and the king become best pals.</p>
        <p>This is magical thinking without the magic. Who can reassemble an egg without a wand or supernatural powers? In this bowdlerized version, Kirk, who illustrated ''Bigger'' and Chugga-Chugga Choo-Choo,'' has so smoothed out life's jagged edges, it's not surprising that he decided to paint his characters flat. They're like stickers you could peel right off the page. Which is odd, because he's superimposed them onto wonderfully collaged backgrounds that are richly textured and complex, creating a strange and multidimensional world all Kirk's own, a world where interesting, truly magical things could (and I hope one day will) happen.</p>
