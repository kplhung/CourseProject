        <p>Nicole Judith Barth and Neal Andrew Thompson were married yesterday by the Rev. Dr. Joseph E. Indano, a Presbyterian minister, at the Lighthouse at Chelsea Piers in New York.</p>
        <p>Ms. Barth, 32, is keeping her name. She is a commercial real estate broker for Tarter/Stats Realty in New York. She graduated from SUNY College at New Paltz, N.Y. She is a daughter of Stefanie Milanich Barth of Middlefield, Ohio, and the late Robert E. Barth, and a stepdaughter of Celeste Barth of Paterson, N.J., and of Dr. Robert Elvove of Ridgewood, N.J.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson, 32, is a director of foreign exchange in New York for Credit Suisse First Boston. He graduated from York University in England. He is a son of Patricia and Norman A. Thompson of Sheffield, England.</p>
        <p>The couple met in August 1994, when Ms. Barth found a stranger in her stepmother's kitchen in New Jersey. ''Uh, is my mother here?'' she asked. The stranger was English and polite. ''I believe she might be on the third floor,'' he said. Ms. Barth climbed to the third floor, only to find, she thought, the same stranger. ''I believe your mother is on the second floor,'' he said, English and polite.</p>
        <p>At last, she found her stepmother, who explained that Nigel and Neal Thompson, identical twins, were visiting for a mutual friend's wedding. For the rest of the evening, the Thompson brothers regaled them with observations of the United States.</p>
        <p>''I immediately liked them both,'' Ms. Barth said. While Nigel Thompson planned to go home to England a few days later, Neal Thompson was going to spend the next month in New York.</p>
        <p>He asked Ms. Barth for a tour of Manhattan, and in a dark cacophonous jazz club he kissed her. ''I wasn't expecting that,'' Ms. Barth gasped. ''I was,'' he said. When Neal Thompson left for England, he wrote and telephoned frequently. In January 1995, he had a permanent assignment in New York, and the two became inseparable.</p>
        <p>By last August, Mr. Thompson was eager to propose. While on vacation at Ms. Barth's stepmother's house on Cape Cod, the couple made their way to the beach under a blue sky and a bright sun. ''I am having a perfect moment,'' Ms. Barth, standing waist deep in the surf, yelled. ''You're having a perfect moment, are you?'' Mr. Thompson said. ''Well then, will you marry me?'' Ms. Barth fell back into the water and yelled, ''What?'' He got down on one knee, water up to his neck, and repeated, ''Will you marry me?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Barth pulled him out of the surf and made him propose again, on the beach. And he did. They walked the beach to the bottom of the stairs leading back to her stepmother's house, and Ms. Barth demanded a third proposal. Once more, Mr. Thompson proposed. Yelling and whooping, Ms. Barth bounded up the stairs and asked to be proposed to one more time. ''I just love hearing it,'' she said.</p>
        <p>WEDDINGS  Correction:  May 21, 2000, Sunday  A report last Sunday about the marriage of Nicole Judith Barth and Neal Andrew Thompson misstated the location of her mother and stepfather's current residence. They live together in Manhattan, not separately in Middlefield, Ohio, and Ridgewood, N.J.</p>
        <p>The report also misstated the location of Ms. Barth's first encounter with Mr. Thompson. It was at the home of her mother and stepfather, then in Ridgewood, not at her stepmother's home in Paterson. In addition the report referred incorrectly to the Cape Cod home in which the proposal took place. It is owned by her mother and stepfather, not her stepmother.</p>
