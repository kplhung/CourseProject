        <p>TIERS AND CHEERS</p>
        <p>The Devils and Nets have finished their seasons and Bruce Springsteen isn't touring this summer so, if you have the cash and the inclination, you and as many as 19,040 of your friends can rent out the Continental Arena in the Meadowlands sports complex. According to Ron VanDeVeen, the arena's assistant vice presidetn of administration, it will cost you a mere $2,000 an hour, plus expenses, which could run as high as $20,000 if you were to have a stage and a big sound system put up and hire some security guards to monitor your guests. If you want to put on your own concert and charge the public, the fee is considerably higher - 15 percent of the gross, with a minimum of $20,000. But, Mr. VanDeVeen said, private parties are welcome, the arena is air-conditioned all summer and they'll even leave up the basketball floor for you if that's your kind of fun.</p>

        <p>RENT-A-BYE, BABY  You've got your week at the beach and a boatload of stuff that isnever going to fit into the family sedan. Why not stash some of that sutff back in the garage and rent the more bulky items down at the shore? Wildwood Crib Rental Service has wheelchairs ($15 a night; $42 a week); beach umbrellas ($8 a night; $20 a week); roll-away beds ($12 a night; $32 a week); and, of course, cribs ($15 a night; $38 a week). With a $15 minimum, the company will even deliver the rentals to your door, and pick them up later. ''Some people call months in advance, but most times a day is good notice,'' said Rosana Melli, the owner.</p>
        <p>Wildwood Crib Rental Service, 4903 Pacific Avenue, Wildwood. (609)522-2724</p>
        <p>EQUINE, HOURLY</p>
        <p>Even smack dab in the center of the country's most crowded state, there are still some wonderful open spaces in which to indulge your fantasies of country living. Washington Riding Stables opens its wooded trails to the public on weekends for trail riding. An hour's ride through the woods, open fields and stream beds is $23 for those age 9 and up (helmet rental extra). No special clothes required, but jeans and sneakers or work boots are likely to be most comfortable. Shorter pony rides for children ages 2 to 8 are $7. Riding lessons are $35 an hour. Hours are Saturday and Sunday 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., or by appointment.</p>
        <p>Washington Riding Stables, 1707 South Washington Avenue, Piscataway. (732)249-2471 or (732)545-6220</p>
        <p>HEAR, HEAR</p>
        <p>Say you wanted a New Jersey Net to speak at the bash you plan in August, or maybe a world-renowned scientist from Princeton, or maybe even someone who will motivate you to lose that 15 pounds. Janet R. Pickover stands ready to find that special someone to blab at you. She owns the Right Speaker, part of her JR Associates meeting planning service in Princeton. While she has a stable of 800 speakers from former Olympic athletes to motivational gurus, she'll go out and find whomever you might want and try to book them. Typical fees start at $2,500 and go well into five figures. Oddly enough, celebrities might be easier to get on short notice than others. ''Professional speakers like to be booked as much as a year out,'' said Ms. Pickover. ''Celebrities hate to be committed too far in advance, though, of course, they may command the biggest fee.''</p>
        <p>The Right Speaker, 86 Poe Road, Princeton. (609)921-6605</p>
        <p>ON THE AIR</p>
        <p>Bill Umstattd thinks he can cure most anyone's fear of flying. ''Why, I once had a guy who said he couldn't even fly in a plane without being scared,'' said Mr. Umstattd. ''I took him up hang gliding and he couldn't wait formore.'' The tandem aero-low hang glider that is Mr. Umstattd's classroom has you sidy-by-side with him as a plane drags you up 3,000 feet in the air. Then the 250-foot-long tow rope drops and you steer (along with Mr. Umstattd) through thermal waves and cumulus clouds until you touch down on Earth about 15 minutes later. ''The tandem is zero physical effort and 100 percent marvelous,'' said Mr. Umstattd, who will charge you $95 for the glide and the safety lesson, flying out of the little Red Wing Airport in Columbus, Burlington County.</p>

        <p>STEP INTO MY PARLOR</p>
        <p>Though the Jersey Shore abounds in marvelous ice cream parlors, there is nowhere else like the Showplace, where your servers stop in mid-scoop to deliver up show tunes and bus your tables amid tap dances and other histrionics. You can rent out the whole joint for yourselves from 4:30 to 5:45 p.m. daily in the summer. For an ice cream sundae and cabaret show, it's $9 a person (any minimum). Add a 6 p.m. children's theater production at the Surflight Theater next door and it's $14 a person; this package is available only Wednesdays through Sundays.) Drop another $25 and Winnie the Pooh will be at the party, too. If you are just doing things a la carte, maybe you'd like the Anything Goes sundae: 12 flavors of ice cream, two sorbets, seven toppings, banana wheels, we walnuts, whipped cream and cherries. Said to serve from one (hmmmm!) to 10 people at $50.</p>
        <p>The Showplace, Centre Street and Beach Ave, Beach Haven. (609)492-0018.</p>
        <p>SCREEN DREAM</p>
        <p>The Ritz isn't like old movie palaces, but it's what modern movie houses should be. Its arched lobby is full of plush, modern chairs and couches. It has a coffee bar with reasonably priced espresso ($2), biscotti ($1.25), four flavors of hot chocolate ($2.50) and even raspberry-and-white-chocolate cheesecake ($3.75). Take your refreshments over to the hip steel-and-Formica seating area and choose an American Photo or Wall Street Journal or Opera News from the magazine rack. The regular food stand has such worthies as Guylian Sugar-Free Dark Chocolate ($2.50), Haagan-Dazs Sorbet Yogurt Bars ($2) and Toblerone ($2.50), but also old movie faves like Jujyfruits and Goobers ($2). The Ritz sells movie posters the day after the movie ends for $7.50 and, best of all, the voices are top-of-the-lione, be they art house, retrospectives or just better Hollywood offerings. Rent the best movie experience in the state for $7.50 for an evening or $5 before 5 p.m. or all day Wednesdays. One restriction: children under 6 aren't allowed and those aged 6 to 16 must be accompanied by a parent.</p>
