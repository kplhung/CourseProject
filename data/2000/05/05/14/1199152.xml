        <p>RENATO'S LUCK</p>
        <p>By Jeff Shapiro.</p>
        <p>334 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>HarperCollins Publishers. $24.</p>
        <p>No sun-shot clime has inspired more passionate writing than Tuscany, and the best of it ranges across a wide thematic territory: everything from modern novels like Penelope Fitzgerald's ''Innocence'' and Michael Ondaatje's ''English Patient'' to Renaissance classics like Vasari's ''Lives of the Artists'' and, even earlier, Dante's ''Commedia.'' But ''Renato's Luck,'' Jeff Shapiro's first novel, threatens to take the cake, at least theologically speaking. For what is revealed in Shapiro's Tuscany is nothing less than the wisdom of the first, the truest Christians, whose mark, the sign of the fish, figures largely in the plot.</p>
        <p>The time is the present. Twenty miles from Siena, the town of Sant'Angelo D'Asso is about to disappear, scheduled to be flooded by a dam. But that's just one of many reasons Renato Tizzoni, a waterworks engineer and part-time shepherd, is in a funk. Not only is he responsible for pipes that are outmoded and about to become superfluous, he's also mourning the recent death of his mentor and best friend. In addition, despite valiant efforts to remain a good husband, he no longer lusts exclusively for his wife, Milena. Worse, their 17-year-old daughter is pregnant by her saxophone-playing boyfriend.</p>
        <p>The luck of the title is prefigured by a dream in which Renato sees a hand hovering in the darkness, one ringed finger glinting with a red stone, beckoning him outside to discover a wooden box filled with gold. In the meantime, the waking Renato is hired to fix the faulty plumbing of an English actress, Meg Barker, who shamelessly flirts with him as soon as they're alone. While he manages to resist her advances, he can't help brooding about the pair of secrets -- his portentous dream and the unwanted allure of this woman -- that he must keep from his beloved Milena. In confusion, he consults with the occupants of his pasture: ''I was an idiot, he told the woolly white ears of the second sheep. Truly an idiot to think the dream was literal. Fool! Why should I think a wooden box is really a wooden box? . . . No, it's symbolic, is what it is. But symbolic of what?'' In reply, ''the sheep burped.''</p>
        <p>Luckily, another sheep is nearby, one that proves to be more on Renato's wavelength. And so he is inspired to see that the hand in his dream belongs to the pope, and that what Renato needs is un bel colpo di culo -- a phrase that means both ''a stroke of luck'' and a stroke across someone's rump. After all, he concludes, ''Luck is a force of nature, the same as water. And water flows through conduits, like the pipes I run around fixing every day.'' In other words, the pope's luck will flow to Renato if he touches the Holy Father's hand. But in order to change his luck, Renato figures that he must touch his own rump ''in that very same moment in which I shake the hand of the pope.'' All this is narrated with neither the author's, Renato's nor the sheep's tongue in cheek.</p>
        <p>In lieu of irony or humor, Shapiro asks us to revel in ''the simple human heart that lived inside Renato'' -- and perhaps, unfortunately, his simple mind as well. When he hears unfamiliar music, for example, all Renato knows is that it is ''something classical. He wasn't sure, maybe Vivaldi. Or maybe somebody else. Music wasn't something he knew about.'' Another drawback is that Shapiro often confuses simplicity with the merely obvious. (A typical sentence has Milena ''back in the kitchen preparing things for dinner, to be served later.'')</p>
        <p>In ''Renato's Luck,'' Shapiro has created a cartoon world populated by evil Fascists and mothers-in-law, beneficent peasants and pontiffs -- and, of course, wondrously shrewd sheep. Not surprisingly, his orchestration of events begins to seem risibly overdetermined. A scene in which Renato fails to finish making love to his wife is soon followed by one in which the actress pays inordinate attention to him. Later, Renato recalls lending Milena his wool sweater when they were young and feeling, after she gave it back, that it was ''as holy to him as if the Virgin Mary herself had used it to keep her baby warm.''</p>
        <p>Embedded within the blubbery prose of ''Renato's Luck'' there may well be a sunny, God-fearing little novel. Renato's struggle to overcome earthly temptation, to face his loved ones' mortality and his daughter's pregnancy, to save his town, is often tenderly convincing. But the story is so larded with obvious symbolism and bleating platitudes that the reader may never see past them. And the finale, which begins when the pope trips and falls into Renato's arms, can only be called a contrivance of ecumenical proportions.</p>
