        <p>THOUGH the singer-songwriter Margo Hennebach of Bloomfield earned her undergraduate degree from the Oberlin Conservatory, she said it was her experience as a music therapist that taught her how best to relate to an audience.</p>
        <p>''I played hospitals and nursing homes,'' said Ms. Hennebach, who performs with her husband, Mark Saunders, on Saturday at St. John's Episcopal Church in Salisbury. ''The main thing I learned from doing musical therapy is to ride the flow of your audience. It's important to make that connection.''</p>
        <p>Since leaving her job at Fair Oaks Hospital in New Jersey 10 years ago, Ms. Hennebach has connected with quite a few audiences. Her rapport is such that even at large shows, like at the Falcon Ridge Folk Festival in Hillsdale, N.Y., she creates a living-room atmosphere.</p>
        <p>''Music, by its nature, is a private and public event,'' said Ms. Hennebach, who often worked with pediatric cancer patients. ''Every work of art begins with an impulse, an a-ha moment of finally understanding something or being profoundly moved. My job is to breathe life into this tiny ember without being too willful about it, otherwise it will elude me.''</p>
        <p>Not too much eludes Ms. Hennebach. She has recorded four CD's of her own (Mr. Saunders has performed on all but her first) and appears on several compilation recordings. In 1994 she released her eponymous CD, followed two years later by ''Michaelean.'' ''Big Love'' came out in 1998 and her Christmas recording, ''Comfort and Joy,'' came out last year. Since Ms. Hennebach and Mr. Saunders both come from conservatory backgrounds -- Mr. Saunders studied classical guitar at Hartford Conservatory -- their style includes classical as well as folk, pop and Celtic styles.</p>
        <p>''Mark started out as a side man,''  Ms. Hennebach said. ''Then we started collaborating a lot more. I may write most of the songs, but he has a lot of influence on the music.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Saunders said that before he hooked up with Ms. Hennebach, he had all but abandoned live performance for nearly 10 years. ''I went from playing classical guitar in school to playing R &amp; B in the clubs for several years. It was steady work, but after a while it just wasn't very fulfilling.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Saunders took time for some soul searching, managing a music store outside Hartford and exploring new styles on his Martin guitar. Because of the way things turned out, he said he doesn't regret taking a hiatus from his performance career. ''The way I look at it,'' he said, ''I feel pretty blessed to spend time with my wife, travel around and get paid for performing music we like.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Saunders also enjoys playing the occasional date in prisons, psychiatric hospitals and oncology units with Ms. Hennebach, who has not entirely quit playing such venues.</p>
        <p>''It helps keep me connected,'' said Ms. Hennebach, who earned her master's degree in music therapy from the Guildhall School of Music and Theater in London. ''Just when I'm taking my career -- and myself -- too seriously, I do one of these concerts and remember what's important.</p>
        <p>''Once at Connecticut Valley Hospital in Middletown, Mark and I were playing 'Stand by Me,' and everyone was singing,'' she said. ''One of the patients walked up to the stage and I thought he wanted to sing into the mike with me, but he just stood there. Of course, he wanted to 'stand by me.' Now he was aware of the dialogue I was describing before. Talk about a moment of shared joy.</p>
        <p>''As a performer and trained music therapist, I'm interested in creating a space safe enough for people to experience some of those original impulses or truths that are imbedded in those songs,'' Ms. Hennebach said. ''These truths are the centerpiece of the concert. The music is just window dressing around a conversation that is happening between me and the audience.''</p>
        <p>Margo Hennebach performs with Mark Saunders on Saturday at St. John's Episcopal Church, 12 Main St., Salisbury. Show time is 8 p.m. The number to call for information is (860) 435-6240. The duo performs a 9 p.m. show on May 21 at the Towne Crier Cafe, Route 22, Pawling, NY. (914) 855-1300.</p>
