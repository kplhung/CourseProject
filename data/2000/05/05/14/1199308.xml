        <p>WILL it be third-time-lucky for swimmers here?</p>
        <p>Somers is one of only three towns in Westchester without a public pool, and debate over building one has persisted since the early 1970's. Proposed pools have been rejected twice in referendums.</p>
        <p>On June 20, there will be a third referendum, this time on a $5 million, four-pool complex next to Reis Park, the town's main recreational spot and the site of the public library.</p>
        <p>Many see it as a showdown between two schools of thought about the town's future: Young families seeking that most basic of suburban staples, an outdoor town pool, and traditionalists who call the pool complex a threat to the rural and historic character of this pre-Revolutionary-era town.</p>
        <p>''It's a polarized issue that really needs to be voted on,'' Mary Beth Murphy, the town supervisor, said. ''People feel so strongly one way or the other.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Murphy, who favors the project, added: ''A pool would bring a sense of community here in the summer. Right now, there's really no sense of cohesiveness that brings the town together. This location is central and close to other recreation areas.''</p>
        <p>But Frank Billingsley, president of the Somers Historical Society, called it inappropriate to build the complex ''smack in the middle of an historic corridor.''</p>
        <p>The pool complex would be close to the 200-year-old Mount Zion Church, one of the oldest Methodist meetinghouses in Westchester, and not far from other historic sites along Route 139. Crowds of splashing children within view and earshot of the church, Mr. Billingsley said, would disrupt the historic character of the church and its cemetery, with its time-worn gravestones, wrought-iron fence and stone walls.</p>
        <p>''If this isn't worth protecting in this town, what is?'' Mr. Billingsley said. The first settlers here date back to before the Revolutionary War, he added, and the pool site may contain archaeological artifacts.</p>
        <p>When it comes to swimming, there have long been the haves and have-nots here. Residents of the ''lake communities'' swim in the lakes around which houses sprung up decades ago. Most of the condominium developments in Somers have private pools.</p>
        <p>But many of Somers' 19,000 residents have no access to a pool or a lake.</p>
        <p>''Besides just offering swimming, a town pool would create a place for everyone in town to socialize during the summer months and enhance our sense of community,'' said Patti Bancone, who has united about 65 volunteers, mostly local mothers, to support the project. ''There's never been any place for the community to go in the summer.''</p>
        <p>The complex, which would open by June 2002, would be built on land that is currently owned by a private developer. It would include a kiddie pool, a diving pool, a water-slide pool mostly for teenagers and a main pool with an adult section, an area for handicapped swimmers and an attached lap pool. All the pools would be outdoors.</p>
        <p>Plans also include a bathhouse, a refreshment stand and picnic areas.</p>
        <p>Separate pools were planned, Mrs. Bancone said, so that users ''would not be on top of each other'' and so teenagers would enjoy having ''their own pool'' to use.</p>
        <p>Through membership fees ($415 for a family each summer), the pool would operate at a profit, Mrs. Bancone said.</p>
        <p>''If this fails, we'll have to wait another 10 years,'' she said, observing that plans were revised to include a landscape buffer to minimize any intrusion on the church site and that the parking lot was moved to  preserve more of the southerly views from the church.</p>
        <p>Some opponents say the pool issue reflects a demographic shift in Somers, which has seen more young couples with children move in recently.</p>
        <p>The push for the pool reflects the mindset of newcomers from New York City and southern Westchester who expect services normally associated with those areas, not  ''the semirural character of northern Westchester,'' said Geri Riegger, chairwoman of 20/20 Vision, a coalition of residents, civic and business leaders, conservationists and property associations.</p>
        <p>''When my son was growing up, I felt it was more important to preserve the town's rural character than to build a pool,'' she said. ''It's about what you value more, and that's what this referendum is going to be about.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Riegger called the pool site inappropriate and suggested building the pool either near the Reis Park ball fields or on the grounds of the new high school now under construction. She added that the project would raise taxes, which were increased by an average of $300 recently to finance new schools.</p>
        <p>The project would be financed through a 20-year municipal bond. The pool would add an additional $55 in taxes annually to the average home in Somers.</p>
        <p>Nancy Gold, also a longtime Somers resident, said that in 1971 she supported an effort to build a town pool that her child could use. Now she fears her grandchild will grow up spending hot summers with nowhere to swim.</p>
        <p>With 33 square miles, Somers is one of Westchester's largest towns geographically. But, Mrs. Gold said, the town has remained fragmented, in part because there is no real village, just scattered pockets of stores.</p>
        <p>The pool site, an overgrown field once used as a chicken farm, is on 11 acres that are part of a 630-acre parcel along Route 139, known as the Eagle River development. It is owned by a group of private investors called the Eaglet Company, which is applying to the town for zoning approval for more than 100 homes.</p>
        <p>Henry M. Hocherman, a lawyer in Mount Kisco representing the developers, said that Somers has never asked to buy the land. Last year, his clients offered to donate the parcel to Somers, provided that the town planning board refrain from downzoning the land. The town refused.</p>
        <p>''They said that when they were ready, they would just condemn the property,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Murphy, the town supervisor, said that if voters approve the pool complex next month, Somers would offer fair market value -- not to exceed $1.4 million -- for the land. If the offer is refused, she said, the town would consider taking the land through a court order for public use. She also said that, if voted down, the proposal would likely be shelved for several years.</p>
