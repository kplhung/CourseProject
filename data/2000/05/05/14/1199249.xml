        <p>TO literate Europeans of the 19th century, the poet, playwright and historian Friedrich Schiller (1759-1805) ranked right up with Shakespeare, an idol he honored not only by conscious imitation but also in a translation of ''Macbeth.''</p>
        <p>Today, even in his native Germany, Schiller's works for the stage survive mostly as refracted through operas by Rossini, Verdi and Tchaikovsky -- a mere handful of the dozens their revolutionary idealism inspired. And over the last half century, ''Don Carlos,'' formerly a pillar of the classical German canon, has gone into eclipse, even as the majestically flawed Franco-Italian epic by Verdi has moved from the fringe of the repertory very nearly into the center.</p>
        <p>Once a classic, now a footnote. And tomorrow?</p>
        <p>From Tuesday through Saturday at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, a brief run of the play by the Royal Shakespeare Company provides a rare chance to take our Schiller straight. Straight, that is, within the parameters of a production that Gale Edwards has directed in modern dress, and a verse translation by Robert David MacDonald that was described by one London critic as ''fleet, colloquial but often remarkably resonant'' -- phrases of limited application to Schiller's original. (Resonant his language is, fleet it can be, colloquial it is not.)</p>
        <p>The production could prove a revelation for theater fans and opera buffs alike. The case, it bears noting, resembles that of Verdi's late Shakespearean masterpieces not at all. To know ''Otello'' and ''Falstaff'' is in some sense to know their Shakespearean prototypes. To know ''Don Carlos'' through Verdi is hardly to know the play.</p>
        <p>Yes, the five principal characters in the stage version form the constellation familiar from the opera. The icy, tyrannical King Philip II of Spain, old enough to be the father or grandfather of his historical counterpart and gnawed by private griefs and doubts. Elizabeth of Valois, his virtuous queen, the pawn of royal matrimonial politics, once betrothed (as in truth she was) to Philip's high-strung son, Don Carlos, whose feelings for her remain those of a desperate lover. The Marquis of Posa, the prince's close friend, drawn fatally into the gravitational field of the king. Princess Eboli, the king's mistress, enamored of the prince.</p>
        <p>Driving the action are the prince's deranged attempts to recapture the queen's heart, and Posa's effort to win the prince for his own, no less dangerous, cause: religious independence for the Spanish-occupied Low Countries.</p>
        <p>The big political picture -- the thought police of the reactionary church and state ranged against the upstart libertarians of faraway Flanders -- is another constant carried over from the play to the opera. But in the overall plotting, general matters of style and tone and strategic use of spectacle, not to mention countless minute particulars, the libretto Joseph Mery and Camille du Locle fashioned for Verdi takes lordly liberties.</p>
        <p>With transparently ''operatic'' intent, they introduced a new opening act, furnishing a brief idyll of bliss for Don Carlos and Elizabeth before destiny tears them apart. They punctuated the play's succession of mainly private scenes with big public episodes (including a brutal auto-da-fe) and major opportunities for the chorus. Cutting and pasting with abandon, they eliminated lesser roles, not always improving the dramatic logic. Nor did they spare the principal figures, either. En route to the opera house, Elizabeth (who to the prince's chagrin is forever being referred to as his mother) lost the children she has in Schiller's play, which perhaps renders her a more plausible object of romantic devotion but no longer sharpens the terms of her conflict between desire and duty. Less usefully, they excised cloak-and-dagger absurdities in the final scene (Don Carlos dresses up as his grandfather's ghost) in favor of a botched trick ending of their own.</p>
        <p>We have yet to factor in the music, which paints a succession of powerfully contrasting frescoes in an inexhaustible palette of ravishing colors. Not only that. Verdi's genius for melody and cadence means that each character has a personal voice -- a trait foreign to the play, in which, by design, everyone speaks (as it were) the same language.</p>
        <p>The consistency of tone in the play ''Don Carlos'' (ceremonious, rhetorical, unsullied by the wit, grit and malapropisms that energize Shakespeare) is one hint of many that its true home is not the playhouse but the study. In fact, Schiller called ''Don Carlos'' neither play nor tragedy but ''a dramatic poem,'' thus a medium less for actors than for the voice of the poet. That voice, and it alone, is Schiller's ''music.''</p>
        <p>The poem's genesis lasted some five years, yielding five acts totaling 5,370 lines of blank verse -- the equivalent of three full-length plays of Racine. (A prose version prepared by the playwright exists.) The world premiere, in 1787 when Schiller was not yet 30, was a triumph. Still, the advance publication of drafted scenes (some with stage directions of all but novelistic density), as well as a series of 12 open letters by the playwright in response to criticism, are ample evidence that ''Don Carlos'' was a literary -- even philosophical -- phenomenon at least as much as it was a theatrical one.</p>
        <p>A true son of the Enlightenment, Schiller abominated absolutism and deified civil liberty. Virtually all he wrote -- ''Don Carlos'' emphatically included -- forms part of his lifelong manifesto against tyranny in all its forms: personal, social, political and ecclesiastical.</p>
        <p>Attempts to perform the full text have been few. Huge cuts were a necessity from the start, and while salvaging the plot is quite easy, crucial qualities of the dialogue inevitably suffer. Schiller's polished blank verse (often indistinguishable from his friend Goethe's) sits curiously with the stuttering, jumpy movement of the characters' thought. When speeches run long (and they often do), it is not because a person has complicated new information to impart but because that person is at a loss to seize a clear thought from a blur of emotion.</p>
        <p>A spectator, or even a reader pedantically parsing the ambiguities on the printed page, may well encounter the same difficulty, further aggravated by mechanics of the plot. A flurry of highly sensitive letters, amorous and political (anonymous, misinterpreted, deliberately deceptive) generate no end of smoke. The players' myriad naive or optimistic misreadings of others' temperament or motives add that much more. Within the gloomy cloud of unknowing, a simple, declarative sentence shines like a beacon. ''I need love.'' ''He thinks 'tis proven.''  ''She is false.''  ''The king has wept.''</p>
        <p>The first of these lines is spoken by the prince early on, the third by his father, deep into the drama. The second, summing up the problem with Posa, belongs to Domingo, the king's Machiavellian father-confessor, the last to Count Lerma, head of the royal bodyguard.</p>
        <p>Schiller's debts to Shakespeare take many forms -- literary allusion, outright quotation and patterns of metaphor among them. But most Shakespearean of all is his attention to subsidiary players. In ''Don Carlos,'' the most imposing of them is the Grand Inquisitor, an evil deus ex machina, 90 years old, blind and yet still capable of crushing the proud Philip by superior intellect and brute force of will.</p>
        <p>Two lesser dignitaries are the subjects of master portraits: the military commander the Duke of Alba, whose iron-fisted rule of Flanders the prince in his starry-eyed delusions proposes to supplant with a tolerant regime of his own; and Lerma, captain of the royal bodyguard, who finds ways to reconcile his loyalty to the king with dangerous, unsolicited confidences to the prince.</p>
        <p>Of others, Schiller offers quicker, still brilliant sketches: the Duke of Medina Sidonia, the undisgraced admiral of the lost armada; Don Raimond of Taxis, postmaster in chief, under whose eagle eye no private correspondence is secure; the Marquesa of Mondecar, who loves her bullfights and burning heretics. Eboli's popinjay of a page comes in for a brilliant miniature.</p>
        <p>These are characters who leap off the printed page. From the perspective of the study, the principals' jobs look much harder. Don Carlos, Schiller's answer to Hamlet, caroms from self-pity to mad elation, his heart forever on his sleeve; what triggers Eboli's infatuation and Posa's self-sacrificial devotion is hard to fathom. King Philip, whose emotional world collapses not quite as painfully as Lear's, weathers his storms and knuckles under to the Inquisition, sacrificing love to power. The Queen's impressive integrity does more to put others in their place (the aged Philip among them) than to win admiration or sympathy for herself. Spurned by the prince, Schiller's Eboli negotiates the surrender of her virginity to the king with the sangfroid of a geisha. Verdi's more formidable Eboli is Philip's mistress from the start -- and has Arab-scented songs to sing that make her much more alluring.</p>
        <p>AND then there is Posa, who has reminded some of Hamlet's schoolmate Horatio, the beloved friend to whom the prince can bare his soul. The resemblance, if granted, is rather strained. Horatio is a witness, Posa a provocateur -- one, moreover, who to his own astonishment captures the eye and heart of his friend's mortal enemy, the king. The position is, of course, untenable.</p>
        <p>Verdi reconfigures Posa as the exemplar of friendship, virtue and selfless tolerance. The character starts out that way in the play, but royal favor goes to his head, and soon he is spinning out of control, play-acting a betrayal of the prince in a suicidal attempt to save him. In truth, though even the prince is fooled for a while, the one Posa betrays is the king. Philip and Don Carlos carry on over his corpse like rival widows.</p>
        <p>To the bitter end, Posa's mantra is humanity. Never does he surrender the dream of a future when thought will be free -- a future of which he elects his self-centered, undisciplined friend, of all people, as architect. A German wit once called the character ''ein Prinzip im Trikot,'' a doctrine in tights.</p>
        <p>That would have been in the days of old-fashioned costume drama. Can an actor in modern clothes turn him into flesh and blood? Soon we will know. With luck, this ''Don Carlos'' could open the door for a later and greater dramatic poem of Schiller's: ''Wallenstein,'' his epic trilogy of the Thirty Years' War, a more challenging and more purposefully chaotic proposition. Tim Albery staged the work's belated, drastically cut professional British premiere (some three hours out of seven), at the Pit, the Royal Shakespeare Company's second London stage, seven years ago. ''In every sense a great occasion,'' said The Guardian. ''A long slog,'' countered The Times of London.</p>
        <p>Perhaps now it is time for a full treatment.</p>
        <p>Do it, England. You have the actors, and Germany lacks the will.</p>
