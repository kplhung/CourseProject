        <p>PREPPING is important, whether the project is personal or professional. That's why a ticket for a preview is less than one for a Broadway opening; why spring training is held in Florida and Arizona where devoted fans can't see the early bonehead plays.</p>
        <p>Even in the paradise of New Jersey, there's much to be done before edging out into the summer wonderland. And for those who want to show off their best, the message is clear: Nobody said it's going to be easy.</p>
        <p>Lifeguarding</p>
        <p>For eight months of the year, Harry and Patrice Back live in the landlocked Catskill foothills, teaching in the physical education department at Binghamton University.  ''But then I turn in my grades on May 12, and I'm in Cape May on the beach on the 13th,'' said Harry Back, who will be lifeguarding in Cape May for the 14th consecutive year. It's also his ninth season as a lieutenant on the Cape May Beach Patrol, where one of his charges is his wife, Patrice,  in her ninth year herself as a lifeguard on the beach at Cape May.</p>
        <p>Actually, the transition involves a little more effort than just finishing the final report cards.</p>
        <p>''I swim four days a week and lift weights three days,'' he said. ''Sometimes I run  three or four miles.'' Mr. Back said he swam ''only'' 3,000 yards a day. ''I'm not a competitive swimmer or anything.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Back said that his wife, who is the assistant swimming coach at Binghamton, was able to keep in shape all year just between her classes and her coaching. She has also been doing aerobics and hitting the rowing machine.</p>
        <p>''She's also into that new thing, Spinning,'' he said, talking about the aerobic bike machines popular in gyms these days.</p>
        <p>Mr. Back also had his moles checked and had one removed as a precautionary measure. ''You are in the sun all day, so you really should get these things checked out,'' he said. ''But we have umbrellas on every stand and issue shirts and jackets, so if you want to stay out of the sun, you can.''</p>
        <p>In Cape May, guards work 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. on two-person stands. They usually do some paddling or rowing each day, just to stay ready in case of an ocean rescue.  Otherwise, the stands have their lunch, jugs of water, simple first-aid kits, suntan lotion and, of course, good bodies.</p>
        <p>The Pedicure</p>
        <p>Lynne Levin of Voorhees was getting ready for the family trip to Cancun, a precursor to a summer of beachtime foot-baring. So she scratched a couple of precious hours into her busy schedule as a speech therapist to get some important foot therapy -- a pedicure.</p>
        <p>Dawn Robinson of Glendora is Ms. Levin's technician and treats her feet with cuddling care. Ms. Robinson prepared the foot-wash basin with tea tree oil, warm water and mineral salts before Ms. Levin even arrived. When Ms. Levin came to sit in her chair, she took off her shoes, rolled up her pantsuit legs, plunged her feet into the bath and sighed longingly -- closing her eyes and thinking about that Mexican beach.</p>
        <p>She soaked her feet for about five minutes to soften the calluses. Then Ms. Robinson carefully pulled her left foot out of the bath, dried it with a soft towel and started pushing back her cuticles with a long, pointed orangewood stick. ''You can't be rough with cuticles,'' she said. ''But they have to be back to get the proper place for the polish.''</p>
        <p>She took off the old polish with nail-polish remover dipped on a cotton pad. After that, Ms. Robinson cut Ms. Levin's toenails straight across with a regular metal nail clipper. ''It prevents ingrowns,'' she said. ''Curved nails can easily become hurt.'' She then filed the nails with a large nail file and trimmed the excess cuticles with a cuticle nipper, that small scissorslike appliance in women's travel kits.</p>
        <p>Next, Ms. Robinson put buffing massage oil on Ms. Levin's nails with a soft, oblong  polystyrene brush to remove any rough  surfaces. The next step was to put a clay mask on Ms. Levin's whole foot to soften dead skin; then it was back in the mineral soak. Ms. Robinson repeated everything on the right foot and then pulled out her footlong foot file.</p>
        <p>With different levels of file grit on each side, she worked over Ms. Levin's calluses from her big toe in for about 10 minutes on each foot. Then she put on a sloughing lotion, an exfoliate that further softens the feet and massaged each foot with spa cream whose main ingredients are deionized water, witch hazel and various herb extracts. She then rubbed in some almond bark pedicure talc and Ms. Levin sighed again, ''It's magic.''</p>
        <p>Finally, Ms. Robinson brought forth the sprightly named ''Toe Thingies,'' which separate the toes widely so they don't interrupt nail polishing. Ms. Robinson put on a base coat and then one coat of clear polish. ''When it's clear and it chips, you don't notice it like you would a color,'' said Ms. Levin. ''And I intend to show off these feet for a while.''</p>
        <p>The Golf Course</p>
        <p>Tom Grimac has been the golf course supervisor at Tavistock Country Club for 25 years, and that means 25 springs of making sure hackers and low-handicappers alike get a chance to play the round of their dreams at one of New Jersey's most exclusive courses. Local legend has it that Tavistock, the club and the town (population 10), seceded from nearby Haddonfield in a dispute over whether the club could serve liquor in otherwise dry Quaker Haddonfield.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grimac is one of those 10 Tavistock residents (he's also the school board president), getting a house in the middle of the course as part of his supervisorship. The man stays close to his work, and sometimes it's pretty close work.</p>
        <p>For instance, each green, rough and tee area has to be aerated every spring. Riding aerators are used for the larger areas; on the greens and tees, the groundskeepers use  ''walk-behinds'' which have rods at the bottom that push out plugs four inches deep.  The idea is to relieve compression created by water throughout the year. The holes are then filled with sand, which allows the greens, especially, to drain better.</p>
        <p>The greens are manicured down to a hundredth of an inch. They are also cut vertically to keep tight and even with a strange-looking hand-pushed mower that has short and long blades. The collar of the green gets the same treatment, although to seven sixteenths of an inch. The intermediate rough gets its haircut with a sit-down diesel-powered mower, calibrated to cut the grass an inch and a quarter high, while the higher rough stands at three and a half  inches. This is not something hoi polloi would have in the garage, but a $50,000 custom-made rough mower that takes an eight-foot-wide swath and can be minutely adjusted.</p>
        <p>Then the sand traps are packed carefully to their edges with riding bunker rakes, and the grass beside them is edged with a regular garden edger. The sand is 50 percent crushed quartz and 50 percent silica, which is better at withstanding the wind and heat of the summer. In the early 1980's, Mr. Grimac persuaded the club to spend money on zoysia grass, a tough variety that was initially expensive to cultivate. But now that it's in, according to Mr. Grimac, it saves thousands of dollars a year in maintenance since it doesn't require pesticides and needs far less watering than most other golf course grasses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grimac is also proud of the variety of plantings around Tavistock. He has put in cherry blossoms to remind members of the traditional tree that lines the course at Augusta National, home of the Masters, golf's most prestigious tournament. Tavistock also has many dogwoods, rhododendrons and azaleas along its course.</p>
        <p>''I try to pick things that are very pretty, but also low-maintenance,'' he said, noting that he keeps a full-time horticulturist on his staff of 20. ''People get on this course heavily in April and don't get off until October, and they expect beauty with their round.''</p>
        <p>The Beach</p>
        <p>The winter northeasters did a number on the beaches at Stone Harbor from 100th to 108th Streets. The dune grass planted two years ago preserved the dunes at the back of the beach, but where the plantings ended, so did the curve of the dunes. In some places, the sheer drop was as much as eight feet to the flatter part of the beach, not good for walking to the water and certainly not good for the stabilization of the dunes.</p>
        <p>So the borough decided to take sand from a more southerly, less-used beach around 125th Street and cart it north to shore up those dunes. The key to the sandy move -- since federal and local officials gave the borough only two weeks in April to do the job -- was cooperation from the neighboring towns of North Wildwood and Avalon, which own the huge equipment called sand pans.</p>
        <p>The sand pans are converted military earth-movers, 400-horsepower monsters with tires six feet high. They are 24 feet long and weigh 55,100 pounds. They have no brakes, so they lumber along quite slowly and stop mostly by scraping the pans on the sand. It's no wonder North Wildwood has named its machine the Beach Beast.</p>
        <p>Basically, the Beach Beast is a bulldozer with a huge container in back. The container has a pan that lowers and, as the dozer moves along, scrapes up sand into the container. For the Stone Harbor beach project, steam shovels helped fill the sand pans with up to 65,000 pounds of sand at a pop. The sand pans then carted their loads back up the beach and, through careful lowering of the back pans, spread it evenly by the dunes.</p>
        <p>''Sand migrates naturally north to south, so we're just bringing it back south to north,'' said Brian J. Murphy of M. V. Engineering in Cape May Court House, who helped supervise the beach project. ''We sell paradise here, so it has to look like nothing was ever wrong by Memorial Day.''</p>
        <p>That project done, Stone Harbor will do its normal beach maintenance. Regular tractors with scrapers attached to the back go up and down the beach picking up trash and other detritus like driftwood and dead sea life. The pine bulkheads and walkways at the edge of the beach will be repaired as necessary. The 25 lifeguard stands are being painted, and finally the stands and trash cans will be put out. The beach will be ready for the many footprints that will dot the sand, old and new, for the summer.</p>
        <p>The Diamond</p>
        <p>Murray Cook spends an awful lot of time in the dirt each spring, for Cook is one of the experts in the care and feeding of professional baseball diamonds. Though Mr. Cook is always jetting off to this client or that -- among themare the Tampa Bay Devil Rays and Baltimore Orioles -- some of his favorite fields are the in the low minors, like the Sandcastle, the home of the Atlantic City Surf of the independent Atlantic League.</p>
        <p>While the Surf's season begins in May, Cook's work actually starts the October before, when he supervises planting the grassy areas of the stadium.</p>
        <p>''We use several types of bluegrass, Kentucky and midnight blue doing particularly well in the Northeast,'' he said. ''It's important to get a good mixture, since each has a different tolerance for heat, cold and sun. If you only planted one type of grass and, say, it got too hot in the summer and that was one that didn't like heat, well, you'd go down pretty quickly.''</p>
        <p>The sand underneath the grass is just as important as the grass itself, Mr. Cook said.  At the Sandcastle, he uses a midrange sand, not too coarse or fine, for the amount of rain that seeps in to keep the grass's nutrients at the right level.</p>
        <p>The infield dirt is a mix of 40 percent clay and 60 percent fine sand, but the batters' boxes and pitcher's mound are about 50-50.</p>
        <p>Building a pitcher's mound, though, is not just a case of finding a mold and packing it in. These days, the mound is not just an ice-cream-cone-shaped dome with all equal sides. Actually, it is squared off in the front with a metal-bar template. Cook explains that pitchers need a 10-foot area in front of the mound on which to land on their extended follow-throughs. ''And if you look close, you find that the pitching rubber is not in the center of the mound, but about 12 inches behind the center,'' he said. ''Also, the mound is not rounded at the top, but has a plateau, a 4-by-5-foot square area, so that the pitcher stands flat.'' The back of the mound is more rounded, with about three feet beyond that plateau to the infield grass.</p>
        <p>''This has evolved over the years,'' said Cook. ''Pitchers have different needs now than in earlier times. They want to have firm footing above all else, and to have the height and length standardized. That's my job, to make sure when the season starts, everything is regular as can be.''</p>
        <p>Bed and Breakfast</p>
        <p>The bad news is that Richard Samuelson used to have a lot more time to prepare his Poor Richard's Inn in Cape May for the summer season. But, of course, the good news is that the season in Cape May now starts in mid-March, at least for weekend visitors.</p>
        <p>''It means we have to do more things earlier and jam it in during the week,'' said Mr. Samuelson, an artist by training, who has owns the three-story gingerbread Victorian that is three houses in from the beach.</p>
        <p>This year, Poor Richard's is getting a lot of touch-up paint in the front, where its primarily green-and-red seven-color scheme has had a lot of salt-air wear. ''The theory was you would go around the house and paint a little every year,'' said Mr.  Samuelson, with a laugh. ''In practice, you tend to skip the hard parts.'' Despite his artistic inclinations, he has changed the color scheme of Poor Richard's only once in the 24 years he has owned it.</p>
        <p>This year, Mr. Samuelson has upgraded the furniture in the communal breakfast room and ditched ''two or three rockers around the house that weren't worth fixing for the 18th time,'' but otherwise the Victorian-style furnishings and bric-a-brac that crowd Poor Richard's will be pretty much the same.</p>
        <p>The backyard is a different matter. Storm damage last fall forced Mr. Samuelson to cut down two 40-foot-tall birch trees, and the bamboo along the back fence had to be trimmed back fiercely. The French drain also had to be unclogged.</p>
        <p>Several of the old roofing tiles had slipped off the mansard roof. ''I used to feel young and limber and strong and fix them myself,'' he said. ''Now I get someone younger and more limber and stronger to do it for me.'' One ceiling had a leak and Mr. Samuelson is crossing his fingers that he patched the roof in the right place.</p>
        <p>''I've also done a number of the normal things a B&amp;B owner does,'' he said. ''I curse the linens that fray after only one year and have to be yard-saled. I try to remember that while I'm doing the fixing up, I don't forget the paperwork. I lugged 30 cans of yard cuttings to the dump because the city doesn't take them there in March. And I hope the ivy is holding up the old wooden fence and not pulling it down. And I'm hoping I don't forget as many familiar faces as I did last year.''</p>
        <p>As usual, he said, he had great ideas for  rearranging the flowers out front, but is going with impatiens, an easy-to-maintain choice, for the 24th straight year.</p>
        <p>The big new thing this spring is to update Poor Richard's Web site. (www.poorrichardsinn.com). Mr. Samuelson said that 53 percent of his new customers last year found him through the Web site. ''That's astounding,'' he said, ''so it's important to keep it up.'' An itinerant photographer took wide-angle shots of the inn, so some of them are now up on the site. And Mr. Samuelson, who draws cartoons in his spare time, has added a bit of humor:</p>
        <p>''Price range due to the usual variables: size of room, size of beds, private bath or shared bath, whether my son's college tuition has been raised again, etc.''</p>
