        <p>It is extremely difficult to write books on the openings these days, or even to give off-the-cuff advice to average players about current variations.</p>
        <p>In recent years, the openings have gone through such a roller-coaster ride that what was judged to be overwhelming for White is put aside a mere month later.</p>
        <p>It is not published analysis that creates such a conclusion, but dissection worked out in private by top players.</p>
        <p>They know a lot, but they are not talking.</p>
        <p>The game between Garry Kasparov and the grandmaster Alexander Wojtkiewicz of Poland in the Kopavagur Quick-Play Tournament in early April in Iceland is a case in point. Kasparov deviated from what he had won with before, and Wojtkiewicz had to follow him into a no-man's land.</p>
        <p>The system with 6 Be3, 7 f3, 8 g4 and 9 Qd2 against the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defense is all the rage now. White solidifies his pawn center and mobilizes so that he can attack on whichever wing Black castles his king.</p>
        <p>Kasparov plays both sides of this system with incredible energy. That may be why he is the strongest player in the world.</p>
        <p>After 8 g4, it had become routine for Black to play 8 . . . h6, but Wojtkiewicz defiantly developed with 8 . . . Nbd7!?</p>
        <p>He wasn't afraid of 9 g5, which he might have met by 9 . . . Nh5, and if 10 f4, then 10 . . . g6 11 f5 ef 12 ef Bb7 13 Rg1 b4 14 Na4 Qa5 looks unclear. Kasparov affirmed that judgment by declining the proposition.</p>
        <p>After 12 Na4, recent games have shown that 12 . . . Qa5 does not work out well for Black: 13 b3 Nc5 14 a3! Na4 15 ab Qc7 16 ba d5 17 e5 Nd7 18 f4 Nb6 19 Rh3!?, as in Bologan-Novikov in Philadelphia last year, led to victory for White.</p>
        <p>Through 13 . . . g5, the players were copying Kasparov's game against Loek van Wely in Wijk-aan-Zee in February, but now in place of 14 Bg2 gh 15 Rh4 de 16 g5 Nd5 17 Re4, which had produced a scintillating victory for him, he diverged with 14 hg hg 15 e5!? Ne5 16 Bg5.</p>
        <p>He surely believed that Wojtkiewicz had unearthed a vital improvement, and wanted to beat him to the punch.</p>
        <p>After 17 Nb6, Wojtkiewicz should have played 17 . . . Qb6 18 Bf6 Nc4 19 Qd3 Rg6 20 Bh4 Bh6 20 Kb1, although Kasparov, with a safer king, would still have had a slight advantage.</p>
        <p>But Wojtkiewicz erred with 17 . . . Nc4? and after 18 Nc4 dc 19 Bf6! Qf6 20 Ne6!, Kasparov started a roaring attack on the black king.</p>
        <p>After 20 . . . Bh6 21 g5, Wojtkiewicz could not play 21 . . . Bg5, because 22 Ng5 Qb2 (22 . . . Qg5 23 f4 wins for White, and so does 22 . . . Rg5 23 Bd7 Kf8 24 Qb4 Kg7 25 Qb7) 23 Kb2 c3 24 Kb1 cd 25 Ne4 wins a piece.</p>
        <p>So Wojtkiewicz tried 21 . . . fe, but after 22 Qd7 Kf8 23 gh Bd5 24 Qd6 Qe7 25 Qf4 Qf7 26 Qe5, he despaired of finding a defense and gave up.</p>
        <p>If he had tried 26 . . . b3, then 27 ab cb 28 Rd5! ed 29 Be6 Qg6 30 Qd6 Ke8 31 Qc6 Ke7 32 Qc7! Kf6 (or 32 . . . Ke6 33 Re1 Kf5 34 Qe5mate) 33 Bg8 Rg8 34 Qd6 Kf7 35 Qd5 Qe6 36 Qe6 Ke6 37 h7 Rh8 38 cb wins the endgame.</p>
