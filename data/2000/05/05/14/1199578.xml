        <p>In a race that included five of the six top finishers from the Breeders' Cup Classic last year, Golden Missile won the $750,000 Pimlico Special over Pleasant Breeze and Lemon Drop Kid yesterday at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore.</p>
        <p>Golden Missile, a 5-year-old son of A. P. Indy, who had not won in six starts since last August, drew clear in the middle of the track in the homestretch and coasted the rest of the way. In a photo finish two lengths behind him, Pleasant Breeze nipped Lemon Drop Kid for second place.</p>

        <p>In a race that included five of the six top finishers from the Breeders' Cup Classic last year, Golden Missile won the $750,000 Pimlico Special over Pleasant Breeze and Lemon Drop Kid yesterday at Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore.</p>
        <p>Golden Missile, a 5-year-old son of A. P. Indy, who had not won in six starts since last August, drew clear in the middle of the track in the homestretch and coasted the rest of the way. In a photo finish two lengths behind him, Pleasant Breeze nipped Lemon Drop Kid for second place.</p>
        <p>Kent Desormeaux, who won the Kentucky Derby a week ago aboard Fusaichi Pegasus and will ride him next week in the Preakness, rode Golden Missile, who is owned by Frank Stronach and trained by Joe Orseno. Afterward, the jockey said his horse won with a fairly easy run, and added, ''When I asked him for more in the stretch, he exploded.''</p>
        <p>Cat Thief, the star of the D. Wayne Lukas stable last year, who won the Breeders' Cup Classic in November over Budroyale and Golden Missile, led most of the way before surrendering his lead and fading to fifth. The 9-5 favorite, K One King, with Mike Smith riding, found no room on the inside, was blocked from overtaking the winner in the homestretch and finished sixth.</p>
        <p>Golden Missile ran the mile and three-sixteenths in 1:543/5  and returned $11.40 for a $2 bet to win.</p>
        <p>At Belmont Park, the Genuine Risk Handicap was won by Imperfect World, a 4-year-old filly who raced mainly in France before last October.</p>
        <p>She made her stakes debut in this country by winning a homestretch duel by half a length over Gold Princess, who had a length and a quarter on Tropical Punch, the favorite.</p>
        <p>As they turned for home, four of the seven fillies in the field were racing together, separated by less than a length. But Imperfect World, trained by Bobby Frankel with Robbie Davis riding, got there first in the rush for the wire. She ran the six furlongs in 1:10 flat, paid $11.80 for a $2 bet to win and earned $90,000.</p>
        <p>''It was a hot pace up front,'' Davis reported, ''and my goal was to get a clear path. She was full of run in the lane.''</p>
