        <p>Randall Anderson letter disputes Lisa Zeidner's April 30 article on best cinematic kisses (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In her analysis of the best cinematic osculation [''When a Kiss Isn't Just a Kiss,'' April 30], Lisa Zeidner conjures up a wonderful index basiorum. As with any such list, one can always make the case for an overlooked exemplar. Following Ms. Zeidner's criterion -- the screen kiss must ''produce a quantifiable rise in blood pressure'' -- let me nominate the first kiss between Grace Kelly and Cary Grant in ''To Catch a Thief'' (and not their more famous kiss on the balcony, set against a backdrop of fireworks exploding over the Mediterranean). In my favorite scene, John Robie has just walked Frances Stevens to her hotel room; Kelly unlocks the door, wheels, and grazes on Grant's lips. We really only see Grant's back, but his tuxedo jacket provides the canvas for the strong, slender fingers of Kelly's left hand to flex and undulate as they pull him closer. If that doesn't result in systolic elevation, you probably aren't breathing.</p>
