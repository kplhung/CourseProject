        <p>FOR months and months, Jacob Bump looked at apartments, riding his bicycle to open houses all over Manhattan. He knew he wanted to spend no more than $150,000 -- but other than that he was flexible.</p>
        <p>Not so flexible, however, that he was willing to consider the studio apartment on the Lower East Side with the toilet down the hall, not even connected to the space that was for sale.</p>
        <p>These days, the budget he set for himself won't buy much in the neighborhoods of Manhattan that are magnets for people like Mr. Bump, who is 26 and the vice president for production and technology at Kardz.com, an Internet card and gift site.</p>
        <p>In SoHo and on the Upper West Side, he said, studio apartments were at least $200,000, well out of his reach. Places he could afford were boxes with low ceilings. And so he kept looking, living for two years in a room he rented in a family friend's apartment at Amsterdam Avenue and 116th Street.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for Mr. Bump, his vision, when it comes to looking at space, is acute. The son of a contractor, he grew up in Barrytown in the Hudson Valley in a house that was constantly being renovated and expanded for the family of seven. While studying German and international relations at Notre Dame, he worked with his father over several summers, learning to build.</p>
        <p>Whether the urge to renovate is genetic or learned is hard to say. But every time he looked at a place, he considered not what it was but what it could be. He wanted a place that could be remodeled to create both a bedroom and a living room. That's something buyers and renters frequently do with L-shaped studios, simply putting up a wall to create a division.</p>
        <p>SEEING the possibilities in a simple rectangle was more challenging. But when he first looked at the studio apartment in the co-op on Madison Avenue near 32nd Street, in a stretch most notable for its rug dealers, he knew he had found it. He figured that by moving the kitchen to the wide hallway and the bedroom into the kitchen, he could create privacy as well as a large dining and living area. He will also lift the ceiling where it was dropped, because the 11-foot height does much to create a sense of space.</p>
        <p>Because of Manhattan's peculiar real estate system, even finding out about the apartment had been a matter of persistence and luck. He had a friend from high school who lived in the building, and he had looked at several studios there. None fit his requirements, but he told the broker who handled them that he was interested in anything for sale there.</p>
        <p>Even as that broker was telling him that nothing else was available, another broker, showing him a place he didn't like, suggested the building. ''They don't want to share with you what they don't get to handle,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Determined to get the place after six months of looking, he went to the bank to be prequalified for the mortgage, and with that paper in hand went to the open house and made a bid. ''I was the first one here,'' he said. ''They could see I was serious.'' He got the apartment for $118,000,  just $2,000 below the asking price, and moved in in March. He likes the place, the location, even the way the light coming down Madison Avenue strikes the building. His office is only a few blocks away.</p>
        <p>Most of his friends are renting their first apartments. ''I have a friend in a 600-square-foot studio who's going to pay rent of $50,000 over two years,'' he said. ''I just wasn't going to do that with my money.''</p>
        <p>With a monthly mortgage payment of $912 and a maintenance of $592, the cost before tax deductions is $1,504, similar to or less than the rent for a comparable place.</p>
        <p>HE'S not worried about outgrowing the apartment. ''I'm the oldest of five kids,'' he said, ''and two or three will pass through New York.'' If he's lucky, some of them may even pass through sooner to help with the work; he expects to start in the fall, when he has more time and money. He will do most of the construction himself,  paying only for plumbing, electric and appliances.</p>
        <p>He bought his furniture -- even the very large television set -- from a friend who was moving away to go to law school. ''I've never owned a TV,''  he said. ''I suppose the next step would be cable.''</p>
        <p>While the place can be reinvented, certain limits of space will remain. Even though the stove is small and storage limited, he invested in some hefty high-quality pots and pans. One skillet sitting on top of the stove straddles two burners. A large stockpot is stored in the freezer.</p>
        <p>But he can't imagine getting small skillets and making dinner for just a few people. Family affairs tend to be large; his mother had 15 siblings, and he has 57 cousins. ''I'm not going to be here for the rest of my life,'' he said. ''It's stupid to upgrade the pots in three years.''</p>
        <p>Besides, anything he can't store can go to the house he bought upstate a few years ago, a three-bedroom place near Oswego with 60 feet of lakefront, in an Adirondack town on Lake Ontario that his family has been visiting every summer for most of his life.</p>
        <p>A small apartment in New York and a house that's a five-hour drive make for a somewhat odd combination. His father tells him, he said, that ''You're the only 26-year-old I know with two second homes and no first home.''</p>
