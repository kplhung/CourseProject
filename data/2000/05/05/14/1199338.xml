        <p>SEEDS of friendship were planted last July in Connecticut between an 11-year-old boy in rural Thompson and a 10-year-old inner-city youngster from the Crown Heights' section of Brooklyn, N.Y.</p>
        <p>This summer the friendship will get some hands-on nurturing when the boy from Brooklyn returns for a second visit to exchange more Pokemon cards, swim, ride horses and take a walk down to Mr. Ernie O'Leary's dairy barn or hide out in a backyard tree house.</p>

        <p>SEEDS of friendship were planted last July in Connecticut between an 11-year-old boy in rural Thompson and a 10-year-old inner-city youngster from the Crown Heights' section of Brooklyn, N.Y.</p>
        <p>This summer the friendship will get some hands-on nurturing when the boy from Brooklyn returns for a second visit to exchange more Pokemon cards, swim, ride horses and take a walk down to Mr. Ernie O'Leary's dairy barn or hide out in a backyard tree house.</p>
        <p>''I think he'll be my friend for life,'' said Tyler Bentley, a fifth grader, about his friend, Maxie Ryles, a fourth grader who loves math at P.S. 221.</p>
        <p>''This summer we're going to a place that has a lot of water slides and we're going to visit my cousin Nick again in North Andover, Massachusetts,'' Tyler said.</p>
        <p>Maxie will arrive in late July by bus with other New York City children who are coming to Connecticut as guests of families in The Fresh Air Fund's Friendly Town program.</p>
        <p>The Fresh Air Fund is a nonprofit agency that has provided free summer vacations to more than 1.7 million disadvantaged New York City children since its inception in 1877. Last year some 400 Fresh Air children were guests of Connecticut families. The number is expected to stay about the same this summer and recruitment for host families is under way.</p>
        <p>As last summer, Maxie will spend two weeks with the Bentley family in their Victorian-style farmhouse where wild turkeys and deer are regular visitors, too.</p>
        <p>''We really miss him,'' said Chelsea Bentley, Tyler's 8-year-old sister. ''Last year we got lost in the cornfield behind my house.''</p>
        <p>Tyler said he didn't always include Chelsea and Samantha, his 4-year-old sister, in activities. ''Sometimes, Maxie and I tried to get away from my sisters,'' Tyler said. He said he has stayed in touch with his Brooklyn friend during the past year by letter and phone.</p>
        <p>Awaiting Maxie's visit this year are also two new family pets, Buddy, the hedgehog and Skittles, the guinea pig. Then, there are some old friends waiting to welcome him back: Al, the water frog; Colby and Bandit, two Labrador retrievers; and Jewels, a cockatoo who whistles ''The Bridge on the River Kwai'' and the theme from ''Bonanza,'' the old western television series.</p>
        <p>''I really like all their animals,'' Maxie said. ''We're going to visit Nick again this year, too.''</p>
        <p>Maxie's mother, Yvette Bumpus, a Pentecostal preacher and a Brooklyn school aide to special needs children, and the boys' father, Maxie Ryles Sr., a retired Army sergeant, said they're happy about their son's relationship with the Connecticut family.</p>
        <p>''He loves this family and can't wait to go back,'' said Ms. Bumpus.  ''I'm thankful to them.'' They taught him how to swim and sent him water goggles and a watch.''</p>
        <p>Doreen Bentley, 43, a self-described ''stay-at-home mom'' and her husband, Bob, 45, a retail furniture business owner, described the Fresh Air program as a welcome experience. And although the couple confided some initial concerns about inviting a stranger into their home, those concerns were outweighed by a strong desire to teach their children values.</p>
        <p>''It turned out we had some misplaced notions,'' said Mr. Bentley.  ''Maxie has enriched our lives more than we ever thought possible. He's giving us more than we're giving him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bentley, a native of New Britain who holds a master's degree in business from Boston College, said he and his wife became aware of the program through a mutual friend who had participated.</p>
        <p>''Our interest was stirred last summer when we read an advertisement in our local newspaper looking for a host family,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Bentley, a local education activist who gave up a career in public relations and marketing, said her children already have all kinds of advantages and opportunities along with material things.</p>
        <p>''It was an awakening for them to bring a stranger into the house, share their things, and appreciate that someone came from a different environment,'' she said. ''The children were incredulous that Maxie had never seen corn growing in a field. They were thrilled for him.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bentley recalled that when Maxie arrived last year, he was afraid to go swimming because he thought there were monsters in the lake, but before he returned to the city, he was the first in, the last out.</p>
        <p>''It took a remarkable leap of faith on the part of Maxie's parents to send him to us,'' Ms. Bentley said.</p>
        <p>''He had never been away from home and we might as well have been in a different country.''</p>
        <p>But perhaps the most memorable part of the visit was the youngster's first night in Thompson.</p>
        <p>''He was sleeping in the bottom bunk in Tyler's room and when I went to tuck the boys in, Maxie told me he prayed at night,'' Ms. Bentley said. ''So we all got on our knees, folded our hands and he led us in prayer.'' It became an evening ritual.</p>
        <p>Jenny Berkett, a Fresh Air Fund volunteer representative for central and northeastern Connecticut, said the program works, touching lives.</p>
        <p>''When our son, Alex, was 8, we brought a Fresh Air child into our home,'' she said of Khenyada Welcome. ''Khenyada is now 24 and about to graduate from Eastern Connecticut State University,'' she said. Her husband is the university's controller.</p>
        <p>Ms. Berkett, who is a receptionist at Windham High School in Willimantic, said she devotes her summer to the Fund's Friendly Town program.</p>
        <p>''Twenty-five years ago, we were bringing some 16,000 youngsters from New York to homes from Maine to Virginia,'' she said. But the numbers are dramatically down, she said, in part because in many households both parents work and also because of negative publicity about inner cities.</p>
        <p>She said there are ways to get around the workplace issue by taking vacation time or sending the youngster to a local day camp and devoting evenings and weekends to their visit.</p>
        <p>''You don't have to kill yourself to entertain these youngsters,'' she said. ''The children will benefit from things we take for granted,'' she said, ''like looking up at the stars or cooking hot dogs.''</p>
        <p>But, she added, it's difficult to get host families.</p>
        <p>''We're looking and interviewing almost up to when the kids board the bus in New York,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Families seeking to become hosts or those who would like to register their children for a Fresh Air summer vacation can call (800) 367-0003. Tax-deductible contributions can be sent to the Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018.</p>
