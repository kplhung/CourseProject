        <p>SAVION!</p>
        <p>My Life in Tap.</p>
        <p>By Savion Glover and Bruce Weber.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 79 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>William Morrow &amp; Company. $19.95.</p>
        <p>(Ages 10 and up)</p>
        <p>Tap fits uneasily into book form. The dance is all about sound and movement; Gutenberg's descendants sit silent and static. The tap star Savion Glover, in particular, is all about loud: a heel hard enough to break the floor, a shuffle to make you skip a heartbeat.</p>
        <p>The second-best thing about ''Savion! My Life in Tap,'' written in alternating chapters by Glover and Bruce Weber, is that it manages to transcribe the noise. It's a tough job: Weber explains that ''noise and funk are not just words to Savion; they are concepts, they are an attitude. What they mean to him is more easily expressed in rhythm than in language.''</p>
        <p>But the book works -- in part because it uses more than language. Sometimes its medium is a written approximation of metal against floor: ''Tickety BLOO kah tickety bloo kah SHUCK.'' Sometimes the noise and the funk come in the many evocative photographs, or the eye-popping graphic design by Paula Kelly, who deserves much of the praise for the book's success.</p>
        <p>Most of all, we understand noise and funk because Glover makes them matter for our lives. The best thing about ''Savion! My Life in Tap'' is how affectingly it imparts lessons outside tap. The book makes true Glover's paean to his mentors: ''You ask what they taught me? Everything. . . . It doesn't matter where I am, something one of them said'll hit me, mad things, like footnotes -- Make sure you put the right foot first, even if it's the left one,' or 'If you can't flow with it, don't go with it' -- and I'll have to ask myself: Are you talking about the dance or life?''</p>
        <p>The loose narrative takes readers through Glover's preschool drummer days and the Broadway success of ''Bring In da Noise, Bring In da Funk,'' which he choreographed and starred in. The story has intrinsic interest, because, as Gregory Hines says in his introduction, Glover is ''the greatest tap-dancer to ever lace up a pair of Capezios or any other tap shoes.'' But the real interest is in Glover's commentary: as he explains what he learned at each stage, his voice is light, straightforward and yet convincing as that of a unique and world-class artist.</p>
        <p>Glover is fluent in tongue as well as foot, able to analyze his own work better than most artists. He gets us inside the creative process, which, for him, seems equal parts muse-sent inspiration and simple logic: brilliant insight and some elbow (or knee) grease. He never seems otherworldly, but his art is impressive nonetheless. Weber writes that ''you count a dozen or more places on his feet that hit the floor and make different sounds: a whole rattletrap full of thwacks, clacks, tippy-tippies, thunks, sweeps, swishes and slams. Plus, he's loud.'' Glover actually describes those places for us -- and, in one of the book's many design pleasures, we get a two-page diagram of a foot with sound locations.</p>
        <p>The combination of artistry and sheer noise is what makes Glover so appealing to young people. He's hip-hop, proudly, but ''Savion! My Life in Tap'' is also a homage to heritage. Weber, a theater critic for The New York Times, gives us the history of 20th-century tap, and Glover gives us what it means and how it feels. His sense of responsibility to his predecessors is one of the book's most inspiring aspects. And those predecessors are not only tappers: ''Give the people some history,'' he writes, ''because that's what tap is, that's what tap carries, history, and not just the history of tap but what was going on while tap-dancing was going on.''</p>
        <p>THE best surprise is how likable Glover is. This is a book full of love -- for family, for teachers and for art. It is also an education -- about tap, and, as Glover writes, about how to be: ''Whatever you do, dancing or whatever, you got to hit. Don't sleep on it. Just hit. Because for me, dancing is like life. The lessons of one are the lessons of the other.''</p>
        <p>These are perfect lessons for young adolescents, who will appreciate the injunction to ''hit,'' and whose parents will appreciate the creative discipline of this rebellion. Glover shows his readers how to bring the noise and the funk with the force of history. The best audience for ''Savion! My Life in Tap'' is probably dancers and those who have loved one of Glover's many projects. But because of what the book tells us about artistic process -- and artistic progress -- it is worthwhile for all.</p>
        <p>A caveat: it will be the precocious 10-year-old who can deal with all the vocabulary words in this book. But it will be the rare 10-year-old who is not inspired to be precocious by Savion Glover's story.</p>
