        <p>IN the annals of bureaucratic slip-ups, this one was a beaut.

        <p>IN the annals of bureaucratic slip-ups, this one was a beaut. Last December, an obscure government agency known as the European Patent Office mistakenly issued the first patent to allow the cloning of a human being. More alarmingly, critics say, it may have granted scientists the right to change the genetic makeup of the entire human species.</p>
        <p>The patent, issued in Munich, is No. EP-0695351B1. It gives its holder, the University of Edinburgh in Scotland, the sole right to make, use and sell human beings created in its laboratory. The university has the legal right, at least for the next 20 years, to prevent competitors in 19 European countries from copying its techniques without paying the university a fee.</p>
        <p>True, the University of Edinburgh, where Darwin once studied, intended none of this -- it wanted only to patent certain laboratory methods that may prove useful in fighting diseases like Parkinson's. The patent office intended none of this, either -- someone forgot to require the correct legal disclaimers during nearly six years of patent review. Greenpeace, the environmental group, discovered the flawed patent and mounted a noisy protest in February, after which the office acknowledged its error.</p>
        <p>Moreover, there are no reported techniques for producing people (except for the time-honored one) and even if there were, European research rules ban human cloning. If renegade Scottish scientists chose to clone humans anyway, the scientists would presumably be arrested under anti-slavery laws.</p>
        <p>Whatever anyone did or did not do, this case of ''Brave New World'' meets the Marx Brothers will not be untangled anytime soon. The appeals process for overturning the 1999 patent is sure to take years. An unrelated 1997 patent involving pig production is flawed in the same way, according to Greenpeace researchers, who filed an appeal, but the patent office disagrees.</p>
        <p>Patents have long been issued by governments, granting the exclusive right to profit from commercially applicable inventions. Biopatents, however, are recent and are based largely on one laboratory mouse. In 1988, Harvard University patented the first ''transgenic'' animal, a genetically altered mouse predisposed to getting cancer. After a patent moratorium in the United States ended in 1993, biotech investors turned bullish on brave new mice (and cows, pigs and, most famously, Dolly, the cloned sheep) because of biopatents.</p>
        <p>Patents don't stop with four-legged animals. Private companies and a United States-British consortium, the Human Genome Project, have been racing for years to compile the complete catalog of mankind's genes, or genome. It may be only weeks before a research team claims credit for explicating a human being as a list of chemical ''letters'' longer than 800 Bibles.</p>
        <p>In March, President Clinton and Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain proposed that data from the human genome be made publicly available without the legal restrictions of patents.</p>
        <p>Patent lawyers, however, say the Clinton-Blair proposal does nothing to diminish the value of gene patents. ''Making the alphabet publicly available has not reduced the value of novels,'' said Colin Sandercock, a patent lawyer specializing in biotechnology in Washington, D.C.</p>
        <p>But patent law will have to be revised and strengthened in the biotech age, some lawyers say. In Europe, at least, an appeals process can overturn challenged patents as in the Edinburgh case. But in the United States challenged patents simply lead to drawn-out litigation without a clear resolution.</p>
        <p>BIOTECHNOLOGY, meanwhile, has raced so far ahead of patent law that scientists are encouraged to try to patent everything in their labs. Eric Jungst, a former director of the ethics program at the Human Genome Project, compares overly broad patents to the Oklahoma land rush of the 1890's. ''You had every incentive to say, 'I claim everything between here and the river,' no matter what was in between,'' said Mr. Jungst, a professor at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.</p>
        <p>Broad patents may grant far-reaching rights at a time when genetic engineering is still in its infancy. For example, something called germline manipulation may have more long-term consequences than human cloning, experts say. A clone, after all, is simply an identical twin separated in time. But animals, including human beings, whose genetic makeup, or germline, has been altered pass on a new set of genes to their children and their children's children, and so, through many generations, have a potential impact on the species.</p>
        <p>''Narrowly speaking, you can't patent a gene because everyone's genes are their own,'' said David Magnus, a philosophy professor who led a recent scholarly conference at the University of Pennsylvania titled ''Who Owns Life?'' But, he said, scientists can and do patent the use of genes and parts of genes known as ''expressed sequence tags.''</p>
        <p>In the future, when someone's susceptibility to, say, breast cancer is cured with a patented gene therapy, Mr. Magnus said, the patient is not patentable nor are her children.</p>
        <p>But the repaired genes are the scientist's patented genes, he said. Noting that it would be a ''public relations disaster,'' Mr. Magnus nonetheless noted that ''it may be legally possible for the scientist to restrict your right to have children and pass on the patented genes, without his permission.''</p>
        <p>In the Edinburgh case, the patent application applies to a mousetrap not yet invented. It was drafted in 1994 without disclaimers like ''transgenic non-human animal'' that are routine today. ''In the context of this invention,'' the approved patent reads, ''the term animal cell is intended to embrace all animal cells, especially of mammalian species, including human cells.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, the laboratory techniques described in the patent apply to special human cells known as stem cells, which are a kind of primordial clay that may someday be cultured into organ tissue and, perhaps, entire human beings.</p>
        <p>For its part, the European Patent Office said its 200 biopatent examiners would be even more vigilant in reviewing the 6,500 applications received last year, up from 5,100 the year before. The Edinburgh application was more than 200 pages.</p>
