        <p>The University of Phoenix, a leader in providing higher education to adults, has improperly allowed students to obtain millions of dollars in federal loans and grants, the inspector general for the Department of Education has found.</p>
        <p>The government's review concluded that the university's students had obtained more than $50.6 million in federal loans and $4 million in Pell Grants in excess of the amounts they were entitled to receive. The financial aid is granted to students to help with tuition and other expenses. The audit recommended that the university pay back the money.</p>
        <p>The parent company of the university, the Apollo Group of Phoenix, disputed the auditors' findings in documents released with the report on March 31. But a spokeswoman with the Department of Education said that the company had agreed to a $6 million settlement at the time of the report.</p>
        <p>Between October 1995 and September 1997, the university, which is run as a for-profit business, distributed $339 million in federal loans and nearly $9 million in Pell Grants, awards that help low-income families pay for college.</p>
        <p>When the report was issued, Todd S. Nelson, the president of the Apollo Group, said in a statement, ''There is no basis either in statute or regulation for this assessment.''</p>
        <p>In an interview this week, Mr. Nelson said that by settling with the department, the Apollo Group had avoided an estimated $3 million to $4 million it would have cost to appeal the case over several years. ''That would be unfair for the students,'' he said. ''We are glad to have this resolved.''</p>
        <p>Government auditors found that the school did not provide its students enough instructional time to qualify for much of the federal loans and grants. The university also included cost-of-living expenses inappropriately when determining financial need for students enrolled in correspondence courses, the review found.</p>
        <p>The university measures its educational programs in credit hours, but does not use a semester, trimester or quarter system.</p>
        <p>To receive federal funds, institutions that do not follow the standard approach must provide 12 hours of regularly scheduled instruction, examinations or preparation for examinations during each week of instructional time.</p>
        <p>This regulation, known as the 12-hour rule, requires the equivalent of at least 360 instructional hours per academic year.</p>
        <p>The inspector general found that the university's academic year provided only 180 instructional hours, with the university relying primarily on student study groups instead of classroom time. That meant that some students were not eligible for the aid they received.</p>
        <p>The University of Phoenix enrolls more than 74,000 students at sites in 15 states in undergraduate and graduate degree programs and certificate programs, making it the largest private accredited university for working adults, according to the school's Web site. Students must be at least 23 and employed. The university also offers online degree programs.</p>
        <p>The university's owner, the Apollo Group, is a rapidly growing provider of higher education for working adults. It operates three other educational services in addition to the University of Phoenix. The company, whose stock began trading in 1994, on the Nasdaq market, had $59 million in net income for the fiscal year that ended last August.</p>
