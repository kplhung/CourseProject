        <p>THE YAMATO DYNASTY</p>
        <p>The Secret History of Japan's Imperial Family.</p>
        <p>By Sterling Seagrave and Peggy Seagrave.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 394 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Broadway Books. $27.50.</p>
        <p>For fans of vast right-wing conspiracies, ''The Yamato Dynasty: The Secret History of Japan's Imperial Family'' posits a doozy: Over the last 150 years, four Japanese emperors, and assorted princes and consorts, have been so fiendishly wrapped around the fingers of a cabal of sinister power brokers, financiers and politicians as to make the Chrysanthemum Throne little more than a front for greed, corruption and fraud. That, say Sterling and Peggy Seagrave, the authors of ''Dragon Lady: The Life and Legend of the Last Empress of China,'' helps explain why Japan is today one of the ''world's richest and most deceitful governments.''</p>
        <p>Having reported on Japan for a decade, I was surprised by how much I had missed. For instance, despite long hours spent listening to Japanese leaders dilate on the intricacies of rice subsidies or the dangers of importing aluminum baseball bats from the United States, I learned for the first time that ''many Japanese politicians . . . still state flatly that Japan did not lose the war.'' Here is another of the Seagraves' news flashes: Japan's economy was not really shattered by World War II -- its secret agents had socked away enough fascist gold to underwrite a buoyant rise from the ashes.</p>
        <p>Behind this long-running imperial racket is a crew of Dick Tracy-like characters, including the former prime minister Nobusuke Kishi, who ''resembled a salamander,'' and the ''prune-faced'' former prime minister Noboru Takeshita. (It's true that Kishi, whom I had occasion to interview, was no Clark Gable, and did have a complicated past, but I confess that I totally missed the face thing with Takeshita and, on the whole, found Japanese pols no slipperier, say, than Al Gore among the Buddhist nuns.)</p>
        <p>But predation has its price. By the late 1980's, the Seagraves tell us, ''so much black money was in circulation from war loot'' that Japan's speculative bubble eventually burst. And to think that some of us were bamboozled into believing that it was Economics 101 at work -- too many surplus dollars from exports channeled into too few Cartier wristwatches, overpriced Impressionist paintings and gaudy Tokyo condos.</p>
        <p>The book's real blockbuster, though, is the story of how Emperor Hirohito escaped prosecution as a war criminal. By 1945, we're told, Japan owed American lenders huge amounts of money. Enter former President Herbert Hoover. A well-known Quaker, he conspired with ''a network of Quakers and near-Quakers'' within Japan's elite to preserve the royal family. Hoover and his allies worked to ensure, first, that Japan did not go Communist; second, that its financial gnomes stayed in place; and, third, that Wall Street got its money back.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Gen. Douglas MacArthur, the ruler of occupied Japan, was suborning key witnesses in the Tokyo war crimes trials to keep Hirohito out of the dock, in hopes that one day Hoover and his Republican friends would help him occupy the White House. In saving the throne, the Seagraves argue, MacArthur deviously undermined real democratic reforms in Japan and became a ''perfect patsy'' for the men who had ruled Japan before the war and would continue to do so secretly after the war. (Well, not all that secretly -- several generations of foreign reporters stationed in Tokyo knew where to find them.)</p>
        <p>The occupation had its share of dark corners and high-handed behavior, to be sure. MacArthur did flirt with the presidency, even if his towering self-regard made him an unlikely patsy for anybody. He did use the throne, but as a tool for what the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian John W. Dower calls his ''almost messianic zeal'' for democratizing Japan. Even though Communist advances in China and Korea forced a reversal of early policies, postwar Japan emerged, as Dower points out, ''a vastly freer and more egalitarian nation'' than before the war.</p>
        <p>One needs to be open to new theories, of course, but big conspiracy theories require big proof, and the Seagraves fail to provide it. Despite copious footnotes, key sources are weak, or missing altogether. The authors tell us, for example, that ''documents show'' that MacArthur and Hoover knew about a ''massive recovery'' of Japanese war loot and, further, that large deposits of gold bullion were placed in accounts bearing their names -- yet I could find no further details in their book about these pivotal papers.</p>
        <p>But then you can't be too careful. ''Old ways die hard in Japan,'' we learn, ''where it can still cost your life to speak aloud.'' My opinionated 77-year-old mother-in-law in Tokyo would find that one almost as rich as the idea that ''older generations of Japanese still believe that if they look directly into an emperor's face, they will be blinded.''</p>
        <p>Yet even a book that presents a darkly cartoonish view of modern Japan contains elements of truth. The Seagraves are right to say we should not remember Emperor Hirohito as simply the charming old gent who met Mickey Mouse on a 1975 trip to Disneyland and overlook his role in a war that ravaged Asia in his name. But you have to wonder if it really helps drive the point home to sum up Hirohito's long, roller-coaster reign by likening it to ''the kingdom of Mickey -- his only true rival.''</p>

        <p>we will not be here.</p>

        <p>there is an elderly woman on a bench</p>
        <p>looking up from a crossword puzzle.</p>
        <p>And on the train a girl cuts the curls</p>
        <p>on a doll and talks to it</p>

        <p>I used to meet in the restroom</p>
        <p>in Penn Station was always fussing</p>
        <p>and baby talking into a carriage</p>
        <p>that, except for a few cans</p>
        <p>and some garbage, was empty.</p>
