        <p>A plan to preserve a dozen historic town houses on East 54th and 55th Streets has hit some stumbling blocks.</p>
        <p>The town houses were built from 1870 to 1930 in colonial revival, Georgian, Italianate and other styles. They are among the last examples of such buildings in Midtown.</p>
        <p>Last year, preservationists and others asked the city Landmarks Preservation Commission to create a historic district around the 12 buildings. The commission agreed to consider two, at Nos. 116-118 and 124 East 55th Street.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, last fall, the State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation determined that the 12 buildings deserved placement on the state and national historic registers.</p>
        <p>But six of the nine owners of the 12 buildings objected, and the proposal was tabled. Government guidelines say that properties are ineligible if a majority of owners object.</p>
        <p>''We are currently sending more information about placement on the register to the owners, to see if they might change their mind,'' said Randall Sawyer, a spokesman for the state agency.</p>
        <p>The owners of the two buildings to be considered for city landmark status were among the objectors. They were the Bank of Chile, which says it owns No. 124, and Ancla Investments, which owns No. 116-118. ''I think it's safe to assume that they will oppose landmarking these two buildings as well,'' said Frank Sanchis, executive director of the Municipal Arts Society, which favored a historic district. Many owners object to the landmark process because it can place restrictions on their alteration of the property. Calls to both owners were not returned.</p>
        <p>The city landmarks commission, meanwhile, has planned a review of the two buildings. Terri Rosen Deutsch, a spokeswoman, said ownership of No. 124 is in litigation, delaying the hearing.</p>
        <p>But, she added, ''Because they were calendared, we must be informed before any work on the buildings can proceed.''</p>
