        <p>Mannequins, like the seasonal clothes they wear, have short lives. In 1998, the artist Kenny Scharf designed pointy-headed, one-eyed aliens for Pucci International, a mannequin manufacturer. But in this season of handbags, knee-length skirts and other ladylike looks, Pucci has commissioned Robert Clyde Anderson, a Manhattan illustrator, to design a coterie of mannequins representing the more mature aesthetic of the moment -- highly manicured, blithely self-confident, chin-erect people of the Establishment. The mannequins are precise and tidy. No blowsy look for them. No pierced orifices. ''I wanted an uptown series,'' said Ralph Pucci, president of Pucci International, ''people you associate with Fifth Avenue and a house in Greenwich, Conn.'' Each has a personality, job and name: Hamilton, shown in a dark suit, is a silver-haired banker in his 60's; Caroline, second from left, is a gallery owner also in her 60's. Among the younger well-bred friends are Leander, third from left, a Wall Street broker; Helen, far left, an aspiring model; and Sam, an English pointer. A pit bull wouldn't do. The mannequins, which are called the ''Brownstone'' collection, sell for $1,100 each. Sony Style Stores, at Madison Avenue and 55th Street, ordered 15 of them.</p>
