        <p>ON a brilliant afternoon recently, fresh off a flight from Detroit and eager to absorb the sun's rays pouring into a frenzied haunt near Lincoln Center, Michael Daugherty was doing what he claims to do best: peeling away layers.</p>
        <p>''What are you?'' he asked his unwitting accomplice, a waitress, sizing her up. ''Are you an actress or a dancer?''</p>
        <p>''An actress and a singer, mostly musical theater,'' she responded, complete with a new Screen Actors Guild card, a small part in an Off Off Broadway show and hopes for a break, soon.</p>
        <p>''Well, you have to be patient,'' Mr. Daugherty said, gesturing toward Avery Fisher Hall, the home of the New York Philharmonic. ''I'm 45 years old, and I'm just having my first piece played over there. It takes a long time.''</p>
        <p>''Sure, yeah,'' she said. ''In fact, I just got a guy who is 38 or something, and he just got a Broadway play.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Daugherty smiled, his bubble only slightly deflated by the woman's reluctance to play his game. ''Well, some people have it young,'' he said, ''but usually it takes time.''</p>
        <p>''By the way, is there a Xerox machine anywhere in the restaurant?'' he asked, not quite matter-of-factly. ''Would you mind making a few copies for me?''</p>
        <p>Charmed, the waitress headed toward the back office, papers in hand.</p>
        <p>''That's what my father has done his whole life,'' Mr. Daugherty explained. ''Wherever I am, I talk with people: the store owner, the concertmaster, the waitress. I like to talk. I like to listen. Some composers are always filtering everything out to write 'pure' music. I'm always tuned to the outside.''</p>
        <p>With its pop-culture imagery and playful inclusion of jazz, rock and funk, Mr. Daugherty's music could hardly be called pure in any sense of the word. And where on earth -- or beyond -- he is tuned, listeners may judge for themselves beginning on Wednesday evening, when the Philharmonic, conducted by Leonard Slatkin, presents Mr. Daugherty's ''U.F.O.,'' a concerto written for and about the Scottish percussionist Evelyn Glennie. Commissioned by Mr. Slatkin and the National Symphony, the work was given its premiere last year in Washington.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daugherty described the effervescent Ms. Glennie, who, improbably for a percussionist, is deaf, as having an ''otherworldly, magical presence.'' The work, drawing its inspiration from the flying-saucer shape of cymbals (one of Ms. Glennie's is named Alien Disc by the manufacturer) and from the myriad other unidentifiable objects in a percussionist's battery, fits neatly into Mr. Daugherty's gimmick-laden catalog.</p>
        <p>He has, after all, paid musical homage to Liberace (''Le Tombeau de Liberace'' for piano and orchestra), Elvis Presley (''Dead Elvis'' for bassoon and orchestra), J. Edgar Hoover (the string quartet ''Sing Sing''), Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis (the opera ''Jackie O''), Desi Arnaz (''Desi'' for symphonic winds), Barbie (''What's That Spell?'' for two vocalists and small ensemble) and Superman (''Metropolis Symphony''); sometimes, even in non operatic works, the characters are represented by musicians in costume. A cursory glance also reveals titles evocative of 1930's pulp magazines, names like ''Sunset Strip,'' ''Route 66,''  ''Flamingo'' and ''Bizarro.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Daugherty has held news conferences in bowling alleys. And the cover of his CD ''American Icons'' shows him, all 6 feet 8 inches, wearing a beret and a leather vest, and pattering on bongos in the middle of a heartland highway.</p>
        <p>All of which raises the question: is this stuff for real?</p>
        <p>''Absolutely,'' Mr. Daugherty said, rattling off a list of commissions in the works for ensembles including the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, which this year awarded him its Elise L. Stoeger Prize. ''There's a veneer of pop culture, but think about the way film critics write about alternative movies: say, 'Buffalo 66' or 'Pulp Fiction.' They play off American culture. In classical music, this really hasn't been done much. It is a lonely journey in some ways.''</p>
        <p>It was a journey Mr. Daugherty began in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where his mother was a physical-education teacher and his father a dance-band drummer who subsidized his livelihood with stints as a used-car salesman, an ambulance driver and a manager of a women's clothing store. The oldest of five musical brothers, who all turned professional, Mr. Daugherty grew up playing keyboards in local bands, enamored of the soulful syncopation of early Motown and the wails and growls of James Brown, whose recordings he tracked down in black-owned beauty shops across town.</p>
        <p>He studied jazz at North Texas State University but discovered instead a passion for orchestral music. In 1976, he moved to New York, where Pierre Boulez was the Philharmonic's music director, and the driving force in composition was an exhaustive complexity.</p>
        <p>In 1979, on a Fulbright fellowship, he traveled to Paris to study at Ircam, the center for acoustical and musical research founded by Mr. Boulez. There, in front of his computer, Mr. Daugherty himself subscribed to the more-is-more theory.</p>
        <p>''I decided that I wanted to understand the most complex music being written at the time, and I learned how to do that,'' he said. ''And then I had all the techniques under my belt, but at the same time I couldn't find a connection with my past. Anything emotional to me, I couldn't make that connection in any way.''</p>
        <p>He fared better at Yale, to which he had been drawn by his curiosity about the Connecticut composer Charles Ives and, in turn, Ives's interest in another New Englander, Ralph Waldo Emerson. While working toward a doctorate (which he earned in 1986), he studied composition with Earle Brown, Jacob Druckman, Bernard Rands and Roger Reynolds, trying to determine, in his words, ''what it meant to be a composer, emotionally.''</p>
        <p>''That was something that was never discussed in all my schooling,'' he said. ''All through the years, you're going to concerts, meeting composers, but the emphasis is always on the technical: how to build, how to write, how to come up with new tuning systems or new ways to structure music using mathematical principles like algorithms. Now I was searching for an emotional core.''</p>
        <p>He found it through the nurturing of the Hungarian composer Gyorgy Ligeti, with whom he studied from 1982 to 1984 in Hamburg, Germany. ''Ligeti was the one who encouraged me to look back to my roots,'' he said. ''Here you had one of the heavy avant-garde composers of the 20th century telling me that European contemporary music was dead and to look back to America.''</p>
        <p>Returning to the Midwest for the first time since he had left for college, to a teaching gig at Oberlin College in Ohio, Mr. Daugherty rekindled his love of car culture and embarked on an adventure of rediscovery, driving through the back roads of America, rummaging around book stores and antique markets and mulling over the tales he pried from strangers who passed his way.</p>
        <p>''I used to spend hours going through outdoor flea markets, with thousands of people selling knickknacks,'' he said. ''I would discover one thing, maybe an old postcard, and I'd get the idea for a piece. It was something that connected with me, like an icon or a relic from the past. Going through those flea markets was like going through the Louvre, but instead of Egyptian artifacts you'd have American artifacts.''</p>
        <p>In his studio in Ann Arbor, where he now teaches composition at the University of Michigan and lives with his wife, Yopie Prins, a professor of English and comparative literature, and their 11-year-old daughter, Evelyn, named after Mr. Daugherty's mother, he tinkers on his computers far into the night, responding to visual stimuli scattered across walls and shelves, the fruits of his never-ending peregrinations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Daugherty's music, imbued with a wry sense of timing and eerie references to the past, is a sort of collage, though he loathes the term (along with ''postmodern'') for its implied sterility and lack of integrity. A single concept is explored in its most literal sense; then layer after layer is peeled away, in the manner of an archaeological exercise, until countless associations have been examined.</p>
        <p>In ''U.F.O.,'' Mr. Daugherty envisioned limitless possibilities in the changing nature of the percussion world. ''If you say, 'eight metal instruments,' and you let the percussionist choose them,'' he said, ''the piece will always be evolving, because each percussionist will always come up with new things to play, new ideas, new sounds.''</p>
        <p>Surrounded by a replica of Ms. Glennie's arsenal, he tinkered with a variety of atmospheric sounds he imagined that his alien muse might have brought along on her trip to this planet. He imagined other, less obvious things as well.</p>
        <p>''I knew that Leonard Slatkin's parents had played in Hollywood movie scores of the 1950's, and they most certainly played some of those science-fiction scores. I love that sound of trilling strings, and I wanted to evoke that.''</p>
        <p>For Ms. Glennie, the composer's embrace of performance-theater issues within the framework of symphonic music has long held an appeal.</p>
        <p>''He is not at all afraid to display aspects of his life through music which have been of influence to him,'' she said by e-mail. ''He has a distinct musical voice from which we can always expect an element of surprise. I have to be a fan of a composer's work in order to ask them to write a piece for me, as it was in Michael's case.</p>
        <p>''I love to play a character, and this is a strong element in the concerto. I am an alien encountering all things 'earthy' through my many 'alien' instruments.''</p>
        <p>Next month, another of Mr. Daugherty's cultural compilations will begin to take shape when the Detroit Symphony Orchestra, of which he is composer in residence, gives the premiere of ''Rosa Parks Boulevard,'' a tribute to the civil-rights legend, and the first segment of ''Motor City Triptych,'' commissioned for the city's tri centennial in 2001.</p>
        <p>''His music is fresh and full of life, very rhythmic, very modern, appealing to a young generation,'' said Neeme Jarvi, the orchestra's music director, who was introduced to Mr. Daugherty's work by his son, Kristjan, the director of the Absolute Ensemble. ''I think Michael is one of the greatest composers in our young generation. He is a young man trying to find his way in this world, writing music that the audience likes, that the orchestra likes: fresh sounds, good sounds, without too many tricks.</p>
        <p>''I think that time is already over when composers are trying to find extremes. I think we're performing for audiences now, performing for people. The popularity of a composer is an important thing.''</p>
        <p>Popularity or no, Mr. Daugherty doesn't anticipate leaving America or its mythology behind any time soon.</p>
        <p>''That's where my soul is,'' he said. ''I suppose one could ask, 'Do I ever worry about being pigeonholed as a composer writing about American icons?' My response would be that when my pieces are programmed on a concert, they're real, unique works, and each work has a very particular thing going for it, and then I move on.</p>
        <p>''All these icons are something that is identifiable to people all over the world, or to many people. It takes the place of a common language in music, since there is none.''</p>
