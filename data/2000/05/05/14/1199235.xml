        <p>AFTER the discovery was made in February, John C. Waddell, a New York collector and retired businessman, said it was like finding ''Tut's tomb beyond the attic door of a little Monopoly house in Queens.'' It happened when a dealer came to the house in New Hyde Park to buy valuables and, finding none, was told to inspect the attic.</p>
        <p>There he discovered a long-lost American Modern treasure from 1938: the first plastic shell chair ever made. Actually, there were two of them. The shimmering chairs with curvy clear-plastic seats framed in tubular steel were handmade prototypes of Gilbert Rohde's least-well-known and most innovative design. The chairs represented a futuristic approach to furniture design, using Plexiglas, a new acrylic plastic made by the chemical company Rohm and Haas, for whom Rohde worked as a consultant. The chairs were publicized during the 1939 World's Fair in New York but were never manufactured because Plexiglas was taken out of commercial use by the federal government and diverted for windshields of military aircraft when war broke out in Europe that year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Waddell and other American Modern enthusiasts had known of the existence of the chair for decades, but only from photographs. ''No one knew whether the chair had been produced or whether the prototypes had survived,'' Mr. Waddell said. And no one realized that two such chairs were hidden away in an attic of a sister-in-law of Rohde, probably since he died in 1944. Mr. Waddell was among the first to be told of the discovery and within days bought one of the chairs. The other was bought by Mark McDonald, a New York dealer.</p>
        <p>Now both chairs are on view in New York. Mr. Waddell's in ''American Modern, 1925-1940: Design for a New Age,'' an exhibition of 175 objects at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 120 of which are gifts Mr. Waddell has made to the museum or has promised to make in the future. The show, which remains through Jan. 7, 2001, was organized by the museum and the American Federation of Arts and will travel nationally through 2002. Mr. McDonald's chair is on display at his Gansevoort Gallery in the West Village.</p>
        <p>Mr. Waddell's gifts to the Metropolitan Museum have left many empty spaces in his New York apartment. But this will not end his collecting of American Modern objects. ''I intend to keep buying as long as I can afford it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He added that he would sorely miss the Rohde chair because ''my favorite is always the last piece I bought.'' But there are many other rare pieces that will also be missed: a 1927 desk with a stepped form, inspired by a skyscraper, by Paul Frankl; a 1934 stainless steel and Bakelite triangular coffee pot and creamer from a service by Helen A. Hughes Dulany; a boldly graphic 1928 ''Step-On-It'' penny scale by Joseph Sinel and a sleek cone-shaded floor lamp by Walter von Nessen, also from 1928.</p>
        <p>The lamp was Mr. Waddell's first American Modern acquisition 25 years ago, when he had no idea he would start a collection of that genre. ''I don't think anyone has a fully formed agenda when they begin buying in a new category,'' he said. The American Modern appealed to him because he had tired of the French Art Deco furnishings he owned. ''Everything seemed a bit over the top,'' he said. At the time, he was also buying American and European photography of the 1920's and 1930's. The 500 images he collected were valued at $2.7 million when they were acquired by the Metropolitan Museum in 1989 from Mr. Waddell. The Ford Motor Company paid $1.8 million toward the purchase and Mr. Waddell donated the rest.</p>
        <p>Mr. Waddell concentrated intensely on the American Modern collection in the 1990's, especially after he retired in 1994 as president and chairman of Arrow Electronics, the world's largest distributor of electronic components. Two years ago he began talking with J. Stewart Johnson, a consultant on design and architecture to the Department of Modern Art at the Metropolitan Museum. ''I decided that the collection belonged there,'' Mr. Waddell said. ''It was the Metropolitan Museum that did the industrial shows in the 20's and 30's. Those landmark exhibitions dignified the material, popularized it and encouraged designers to work with American industry.''</p>
        <p>Industrial designers are well represented in Mr. Waddell's collection, beginning with the European-born Americans Frankl and von Nessen, who led the way in the 1920's. By 1930, American-born designers had moved into high gear in Manhattan, streamlining, chroming and glamorizing the newly colorful vacuum clearers, radios, dinnerware and furniture. Norman Bel Geddes produced the show's most iconic object, the red-white-and-blue-striped ''Patriot'' radio,  manufactured by Emerson in 1940. And Donald Deskey made the black Formica and aluminum tables in the exhibition, which were designed in 1932 for Radio City Music Hall and look elegant enough for a palace.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson said he had always appreciated the urban character of American Modern but had decided to focus on how New York was reflected in the objects after he saw Mr. Waddell's collection.</p>
        <p>''As I became more aware of his objects, the exhibition became more and more a show about Astaire and Rogers,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''The people who lived in those Manhattan penthouses, they had made it; they had arrived. That was the wonderful mystique of Manhattan, its towers and its skyline. And John Waddell's objects bore that out.''</p>
