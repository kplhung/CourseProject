        <p>BIG STONE GAP</p>
        <p>By Adriana Trigiani.</p>
        <p>Random House, $23.95.</p>
        <p>Ave Maria is a big country gal with a few big secrets to uncover, among them the identity of her real father and the true nature of family, love and life. A tall order? Adriana Trigiani is up to the challenge, delivering an outsize first novel about this 35-year-old pharmacist and self-proclaimed town spinster, who is hankering for a bigger, better world than her own in the Blue Ridge Mountains of Virginia in the late 1970's. Here the folks (of the poor but clean variety) smoke like chimneys and procreate like rabbits, and tend to call their parents ''mamaw'' and ''papaw.'' They are pure of heart, except for schemers like Ave Maria's bitter Aunt Alice and the beauty-queen majorette, Tayloe Slagle, both of whom get their comeuppance. It's a town where a guy loses two toes in a mine explosion so he goes to work at Legg's Auto World. Ave Maria is considered a ''feriner'' (her mamaw was Italian), tossed together with the likes of Lew Eisenberg, a lawyer who is the town Jew, and Zackie Wakin, a Lebanese peddler. Ave Maria thinks she loves her best friend, Theodore Tipton, the questionably celibate band and choral director of Powell Valley High. She admires his work (''What a perfectionist he is!''), but he pushes her away. The event that galvanizes the town is a halftime show, orchestrated by that perfectionist Theodore, and gala dinner for Elizabeth Taylor and her husband of the moment, the Senate candidate John Warner. Unfortunately, Taylor's appetite gets the better of her, and she chokes on a chicken bone. The events of the evening -- the choking incident actually happened -- end in disaster, but not before Ave Maria sets her sights on a more fruitful path. ''Big Stone Gap'' is as comforting as a mug of chamomile tea on a rainy Sunday served with Ave Maria's specialty: freshly baked oatmeal cookies.</p>
