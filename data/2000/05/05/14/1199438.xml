        <p>THE stock market has turned ugly, cutting off potential cash for Internet companies, many of which can measure their life expectancies in months. And accounting concerns, so often ignored when stocks are rising, are again becoming an issue in corporate America.</p>
        <p>In a speech last Wednesday, Arthur Levitt, chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, threw a harsh spotlight on the often close relationships between accounting firms and the companies they audit. Mr. Levitt warned that accounting firms doubling as consultants might be tempted to go easy on audits to keep clients happy and the consulting business flowing.</p>
        <p>It seems like a good time to talk to Wilbur L. Ross Jr., who has made a very successful career of buying stakes in seriously troubled companies. At 62, an age when many people are considering retirement, Mr. Ross has not lost his appetite for the game. Two months ago, he made waves when he announced that he would leave Rothschild Inc., his home for 24 years, to form his own investment firm, W. L. Ross &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ross took some time last week to offer his thoughts on accounting, Internet stocks and the broader market. Following are excerpts from the conversation.</p>
        <p>ALEX BERENSON</p>
        <p>Q.  Is there a structural conflict when accounting firms offer consulting services?</p>
        <p>A.  That is a bit of an issue. I think there's a question -- I think it's dangerous when a person tries to wear more hats than he has heads, because it makes for complicated relationships. What I think gets more complex is if somebody is a partner in a firm and therefore is benefiting from both the accounting profits and the consulting profits.</p>
        <p>At the actual working level, it's accomplishable, but I think it makes more sense to have some kind of separation between the two firms.</p>
        <p>Q.  What do you think has led to the increased number of restatements of corporate earnings over the last few years?</p>
        <p>A.  I frankly think it's the whole concept of the stock market driving business decisions in this country. I think there are an awful lot of companies that are hugely obsessed with the progression of quarterly earnings. There's such intense pressure on the earnings results that companies are tempted to find ways to regularize their earnings and meet forecasts. Too many companies have reacted by using very aggressive concepts of reported earnings, and that has led to a lot of pressure on the accountants.</p>
        <p>Q.  For investors, what is the No. 1 red flag? Some analysts say it is companies with positive reported earnings but negative cash flow.</p>
        <p>A.  You can invent earnings. It's really hard to invent cash flow. And when a company goes bankrupt, it's not usually because they run out of earnings. It's because they run out of cash.</p>
        <p>Q.  A lot of young companies are now bleeding cash. Are they likely to go bankrupt?</p>
        <p>A.  People forget that when the automobile industry started, there were something like 100 manufacturers of cars. Now there are only three. And it wasn't because the car wasn't a revolutionary product, because it was. And it wasn't because the market didn't become a huge market, because it did.</p>
        <p>I think it's very unfortunate that investors have moved into the position of venture capitalists, financing early-stage companies. It's very hard for the private individual investor just looking at the prospectus, and not having a business plan, and not doing any due diligence, and maybe not even reading it, to make an informed decision.</p>
        <p>For the companies, I think there will be three different outcomes. I think some will just go by the boards; they will run out of cash and go bankrupt. A few already have, and I think more to come. I think there will be another pattern that will get venture money, even though that's the reverse of the current pattern, getting venture money after you go public, and maybe strategic partner financing. And I think the third category will get normal financing, from banks or the public markets. But I think the public markets are largely closed for most companies.</p>
        <p>Q.  What about the overall economy?</p>
        <p>A.  I don't think it's Armageddon, but I do believe the probabilities are that our economy is headed to a slower period. I do think there have been a lot of individual excesses in the marketplace, and those will have to be corrected. It shouldn't be that any brand-new person with a few hours in a training course can make a fortune trading stocks.</p>
