        <p>Democratic Trouble In Broward County</p>
        <p>Florida looks like Bush country. The presidential preference polls there have Gov. George W. Bush of Texas leading Vice President Al Gore by half a dozen points or more. One reason: George W.'s brother Jeb is the Sunshine State's governor.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore says he nevertheless intends to compete for Florida's big trove of electoral votes. And he insists he has a good shot.</p>
        <p>Maybe. Or maybe he's just bluffing.</p>
        <p>Whatever the case, if he is to have any reasonable chance of carrying Florida, he must overwhelmingly carry Broward County, on the state's southeast coast. Broward is Democratic country, home to thousands and thousands of condo-dwelling retirees from the Northeast, particularly the New York area.</p>
        <p>On election days, they vote by the thousands and thousands, spurred to turn out by the county's 40 or so Democratic clubs. In a country and state in which election turnout has dropped to an embarrassing low, Election Day in Broward is a political sight to see.</p>
        <p>But this year there is trouble in Broward. Rather than concentrating at this point on drumming up support for Mr. Gore, the county's Democratic clubs are locked in a divisive squabble over who is to be chairman of the Council of Presidents, the umbrella organization for the clubs.</p>
        <p>The problem: Broward is still teeming with retirees. But as in much of the rest of Florida, more and more young people are moving in (including some Republicans, though Democrats still predominate). Some of the new young Democrats think it is time for the Broward old guard to move aside and let them run things, including the Council of Presidents.</p>
        <p>Last weekend, when they tried to install 40-year-old Randy Fleischer, the head of the county's Young Democrats organization, as Council president, the old guard, many in their 80's, balked and the meeting broke up in an uproar.</p>
        <p>Another meeting has been called for June and the county's Democratic leader, Mitch Ceasar, is working to cool tempers and restore unity lest Al Gore be the ultimate loser.</p>
        <p>''The clubs are a critical element in our get-out-the-vote campaign in the fall,'' he warned the other day.</p>
        <p>Religion in Utah On the High Court?</p>
        <p>Utah was founded by Mormons. Two of every three residents of the state are Mormons, members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and Mormons, most of them conservative Republicans, dominate Utah politics. The Congressional delegation is all Mormon. The state Legislature is predominantly Mormon. The governor, Michael O. Leavitt, is a Mormon.</p>
        <p>But since 1926, the year when the five justices on the Utah Supreme Court began to be appointed (before that they were elected), the unwritten rule in Utah government has been that at least one non-Mormon would always sit on the high bench.</p>
        <p>Or at least that was the understanding until February.</p>
        <p>Then Governor Leavitt broke with tradition. When the sole non-Mormon on the court stepped down, he filled the slot with a Mormon.</p>
        <p>The Utah Society of Separationists, which tried unsuccessfully in 1993 to persuade the court to forbid opening prayers at governmental meetings, strongly objected to the appointment. But Mr. Leavitt stuck with it.</p>
        <p>The society's director, Christopher Allen, contends that the court was ''spineless'' when it was dominated by four Mormon justices and henceforth will be even more so. Utah, he argues, is not a state but ''a solid theocracy'' with a theocratic high court.</p>
        <p>The chief justice, Richard C. Howe, disagrees. He told The Associated Press the other day in a rare interview that he saw nothing wrong with an all-Mormon court, then added:</p>
        <p>''Whether you belong to one church or another shouldn't make any difference. What we want on this court are men and women of good character and legal ability, and their own private view on religion really doesn't enter into their decisions. There may be an exception once in awhile, but it would be very subtle.''</p>
        <p>Students Ready To Speak With Votes</p>
        <p>The way the freshman class at Northglenn High School in suburban Denver saw it, if Gov. Bill Owens was so dead set on joining the national rush to test students at various grade levels to see if they are learning anything, or their teachers are teaching them anything, he should come in and take the test himself. They sent him an invite. After all, they reasoned, a lot of them oppose assessment tests, along with their teachers, and the Colorado Legislature very well might have rejected the bill that made the tests mandatory had Mr. Owens not bulled it through.</p>
        <p>The governor didn't bite.</p>
        <p>Rather, last week he sent back a letter that stung worse than a whack on the hand by a 12-inch ruler.</p>
        <p>''I am certainly not concerned with my ability to pass a test,'' he wrote, ''but I will certainly not take a test because a group of students -- or others -- demand that I do so. If interest groups feel that I can be threatened, pressured or intimidated, then that is a formula for a weak governor. I will not give in.''</p>
        <p>But soon enough the sting wore off. And the freshmen, having learned a thing or two, were ready to counter when a reporter from The Rocky Mountain News showed up.</p>
        <p>''Kind of immature,'' said Kaitlin Hudson.</p>
        <p>''Setting a really bad example,'' added Brittany Stahl.</p>
        <p>Whereupon the governor's spokesman, Dick Wadhams, chimed in with some Politics 101.</p>
        <p>''Can't have it both ways,'' he said. ''If you wade into the public arena and make demands of a public official, then this is the kind of response that might be made.''</p>
        <p>Lesson learned -- and then some, offered Jessica Quimby.</p>
        <p>''We won't be threatened, either,'' she said. ''He's just our governor. We'll be turning 18 pretty soon, and if he keeps this up, we'll probably kick him out of office.''</p>
        <p>Latest Polls Show Bush the Winner</p>
        <p>The Hotline, the popular Internet political tip sheet, keeps a running tab of presidential preference polls in various states as they become available. Last week, 13 polls were added to the list. Here is how things stood over all at the end of last week:</p>
        <p>Gov. George W. Bush led in 23 states, worth 271 electoral votes. Vice President Al Gore led in 11 states, worth 160 electoral votes.</p>
        <p>Needed to win: 270 electoral votes.</p>
