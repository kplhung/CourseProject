        <p>IN the midst of Tiger Woods's golf reign, it's too bad Beau Stedman isn't alive to challenge him.</p>
        <p>Then again, Beau was never alive.</p>
        <p>In a golf mystery that you can put in your back pocket like a scorecard, Beau Stedman is ''The Greatest Player Who Never Lived'' (Sleeping Bear Press, $22.95). Now in its third printing, J. Michael Veron's first novel is golf's literary rookie of the year. It has sold nearly 85,000 copies and the publisher, Brian Lewis, has retained the Artists Management Group to negotiate offers for a Hollywood tee time.</p>
        <p>As literature rather than sport, golf often proves George Plimpton's philosophy that the smaller the ball, the better the writing.</p>
        <p>Not always. Too many golf books are too frivolous. Too many of those books deserve the same title: ''How I Three-Putted Every Hole.'' Because nobody else cares.</p>
        <p>But in ''The Greatest Player Who Never Lived,'' readers are introduced to a golfer just elusive enough to be believed. And to be revered as a mythical cult figure.</p>
        <p>Beau Stedman is the golfer that every duffer never was.</p>
        <p>Chunky at only 5 feet 6 inches, with wild curly hair, using various aliases in his quiet duels with famous golfers over three decades, Beau was on the lam for a murder he didn't commit. All this is told and investigated by Charley Hunter, a law-school hire in an Atlanta firm who discovers Stedman's exploits while filing the late Bobby Jones's papers.</p>
        <p>Yes, the Bobby Jones.</p>
        <p>As anybody who has ever hit a golf ball out of bounds knows, Jones really was an Atlanta lawyer even before he retired from tournament golf after his 1930 Grand Slam: winning the United States Open and Amateur as well as the British Open and Amateur.</p>
        <p>But as nobody knew until now, in the 1928 Southern Amateur at Seminole, Jones lost his semifinal match on the 20th hole when a 15-year-old amateur, one Beauregard Stedman, sank a 40-foot birdie putt.</p>
        <p>In 1930, while Stedman was working odd jobs in the pro shop of a Hilton Head, S.C., country club, he discovered the bloodstained body of Mrs. Henry Gladstone, stabbed 47 times. Her husband accused Stedman, who took off but wrote a letter to Jones, for whom he had caddied at East Lake in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>''You know I wooden do nuthin so bad,'' the unschooled Stedman wrote, ''but what chance have I got? They say I will get the chare. I don't want to die for sumthin I didn't do.''</p>
        <p>In a series of letters, Jones advised Stedman to lay low but keep teeing his ball high. Soon a stranger named Dave Malone won the Mississippi Amateur. Another stranger named Clarence Walker won the Louisiana Amateur. And then Jones began arranging money matches for various other strangers with the best players of that era: Tommy Armour, Francis Ouimet, Gene Sarazen, Walter Hagen.</p>
        <p>It's this connection to golf's real people and real places that makes Beau Stedman seem real, whatever his alias was as a stranger in town.</p>
        <p>In later years, another stranger tees off with Byron Nelson, Jimmy Demaret and Jack Burke Jr.; another goes 54 holes with Arnold Palmer.</p>
        <p>After discovering newspaper clippings and Jones's letters regarding these matches, Hunter, the law-school hire, not only persuades the United States Golf Association to assemble a Beau Stedman exhibit in its Golf House headquarters in Far Hills, N.J., but he also uncovers evidence clearing the by now vanished golfer of Mrs. Gladstone's murder.</p>
        <p>To disclose the author's twist here would be worse than faking a sneeze during somebody's backswing.</p>
        <p>As happens to so many unsolicited novels, Veron's manuscript sat unread for several months in publisher Lewis's office in Chelsea, Mich., until his administrative assistant, Karmel Bycraft, took it home one night.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't put it down,'' she told Lewis the next morning.</p>
        <p>Lewis couldn't put it down either. Veron, a trial lawyer in Lake Charles, La., who has served as a U.S.G.A. committee member and rules official, had a publisher.</p>
        <p>Sleeping Bear usually publishes classy nonfiction about golf and golf courses, but ''The Greatest Player Who Never Lived'' is its first novel and its first movie deal.</p>
        <p>Now it's about to publish Veron's second novel, ''The Greatest Course That Never Was.'' Even though Beau Stedman never played it.</p>
