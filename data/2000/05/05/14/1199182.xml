        <p>THE odds of getting into the competition, ''Vital Signs: Drawing as Inquiry,'' at Creative Arts Workshop in New Haven were long. There were 750 drawings entered from all over North America, and only 65 were chosen by the judge, Robert Reed, a painting professor at the Yale School of Art. It is evident from the exhibition's title that Mr. Reed wanted to produce a coherent show.</p>
        <p>At the start of the 20th century, Robert Henri, the innovative founder of the Ash Can School, said that so much art is just a collection of stock images. With this in mind, much in the show fails to qualify as an inquiry or investigation. Many of the drawings seem formulaic, good exercise for the arm, wrist and fingers.</p>

        <p>THE odds of getting into the competition, ''Vital Signs: Drawing as Inquiry,'' at Creative Arts Workshop in New Haven were long. There were 750 drawings entered from all over North America, and only 65 were chosen by the judge, Robert Reed, a painting professor at the Yale School of Art. It is evident from the exhibition's title that Mr. Reed wanted to produce a coherent show.</p>
        <p>At the start of the 20th century, Robert Henri, the innovative founder of the Ash Can School, said that so much art is just a collection of stock images. With this in mind, much in the show fails to qualify as an inquiry or investigation. Many of the drawings seem formulaic, good exercise for the arm, wrist and fingers.</p>
        <p>But there is enough freshness to make viewers realize once again that drawing is primary to almost all modes of art making. Evaluating drawing entails different issues from painting or sculpture. Viewers are led to speculate where an artist intends to go with what he or she has gotten down on paper. Also, idiosyncracies abound; they're almost commonplace, and part of the game is finding ones with real bite.</p>
        <p>The show also gives rise to a few gripes about the way it is presented: while titles and dimensions are given on the checklist, media is not. Having this information would have been helpful later on, away from the exhibition, for reflection. One of the characteristics of contemporary drawings is that they are made not only with a great variety of inks, pencils, charcoal and more, but also on a variety of surfaces. Some of this information is provided on wall labels, but viewers still run into the stumbling block ''mixed media.'' At times some fascinating substances seem to be in a mix, but there's no means of identifying them for sure.</p>
        <p>Abstraction and representationalism are both amply represented, and examples of both can be stimulating. As an example, hanging near each other are Zoe Sheehan Saldana's ''Drawn Comb'' and ''Tornado No. 14,'' by Kathy Holland. The first is a patient repetition in ink of the hexagonal shape that is the unit of a honey comb. Ms. Saldana seems to be searching for ways to avoid being routine and so she varies the spacing between the units. These seeming imperfections pique interest. Ms. Holland's drawing is dramatically realistic, but the artist has fit a funnel cloud into the confining dimensions of the paper, and it seems thereby to gain power.</p>
        <p>Redoubtable charcoal, which can provide a gray haze or the deepest black, emerges as the star medium in the show. Christopher Burnside's untitled work is distinguished by the liberal use of joint compound, a material used in building construction, which he contrasts to charcoal. Since the black marks in this drawing are arrayed like girders, the novel medium that fills the spaces between the marks has a metaphorical, as well as a technical, purpose.</p>
        <p>An attractive curiosity is ''Drawing Journal No. 98-3'' by Susan Lazar Hart. If this work is truly a page from a journal, that journal is four feet high. But the drawing does have the investigational, laboratory quality of a notebook. Firmly, in charcoal, Ms. Hart has sketched a pedestal with a crouching figure on top. The pedestal indicates that she is giving importance to her ideas, but the ambiguous figure also indicates that she hasn't fully defined them.</p>
        <p>Charcoal's ability to make quick marks that indicate motion is evident in ''Untitled (Hat),'' by Sarah Goldstein. The eponymous hat frames the young woman's face with its downcast expression, but equally important is her hand and arm drawn sketchily to look as if she is waving vigorously at someone outside the drawing.</p>
        <p>One of the basic and most popular functions of art is to tell stories, and from the hundreds of submissions, Mr. Reed chose some good if open-ended protonarratives. The most panoramic is, ''The Life of St. So-And-So, Panel No. 2,'' by Lynn Imperatore. The scene is set in the playground of a school, which is made to look like a town in an early Renaissance painting where perspective is charmingly distorted. A volleyball game is in progress and colorfully-wrapped hard candies are depicted flying across the drawing's surface. A girl with a halo is awkwardly taller than the other children, and a reluctant volleyball player. This is rich material for a story.</p>
        <p>Less context is provided for the woman who stands at the center of ''Me in Hat and Rubber Gloves,'' by Sharon Steuer. The woman's odd costume arouses curiosity, which might not happen if the figure weren't so well drawn.</p>
        <p>Of course, the woman mounted on an animal in Laurence J. B. Tarrant's ''Europa and the Bull'' is a mythological character whose story is well-known, but Mr. Tarrant gives the legend a little twist, by making the bull as meek as a donkey. The two characters in Mikhail Gubin's ''Youth'' are allegorical, and, befitting this, are strapping. Yet, the image of a giant boy astride a stick horse is ludicrously comic, too.</p>
        <p>The simple ''Net Drawing No. 12'' by Sandra Butler is a rote abstract exercise on the order of ''Drawn Combo,'' and it might also be a representational study of a basketball net. But since this is a mostly black and white show, this drawing, done predominately in lime green, serves as a sight for color-deprived eyes.</p>
        <p>''Vital Signs: Drawing as Inquiry'' is at Creative Arts Workshop in New Haven through May 26.</p>
