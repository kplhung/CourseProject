        <p>Jaid Barrymore, the estranged mother of the actress Drew Barrymore, was charged with gun possession early yesterday after police officers who arrested her on charges of putting up promotional posters for a rock band in SoHo said they found a loaded revolver in her purse.</p>
        <p>The elder Ms. Barrymore, 53, who lives in the East Village, and a 26-year-old man were arrested about 2 a.m. at the corner of Houston Street and Broadway by police officers from the department's Graffiti Unit, said Officer Chris Cottingham, a police spokesman.</p>
        <p>Ms. Barrymore was charged with third-degree criminal possession of a weapon, a felony for which she could face a maximum of seven years in prison if convicted, the authorities said. Both she and the man she was with, Paul Charnin, who listed the same East Village address, were charged with criminal mischief, making graffiti and possession of graffiti instruments.</p>
        <p>The two were putting up posters for the Paul Cote band on a plywood wall outside a construction site when they were arrested, Officer Cottingham said. The officers found a Ruger .357 Magnum handgun in her purse, Officer Cottingham said, with bullets in two of its six chambers.</p>
        <p>Ms. Barrymore is often a guest on Howard Stern's radio and television shows, and has talked publicly about her troubled relationship with her daughter Drew, 25, whose successful acting career has overshadowed her own.</p>
        <p>The elder Ms. Barrymore is reportedly writing a tell-all book including stories about her relationships with the actor Jack Nicholson and the rock star Jim Morrison.</p>
