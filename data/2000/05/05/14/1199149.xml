        <p>CRAZY</p>
        <p>By Benjamin Lebert.</p>
        <p>Translated by Carol Brown Janeway.</p>
        <p>178 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Alfred A. Knopf. $17.95.</p>
        <p>''Wunderkind'' is, pretty obviously, a German word, and its latest manifestation on home soil is Benjamin Lebert, who published his first novel, ''Crazy,'' at 16. The book met with tremendous success in Germany, occupying a spot on best-seller lists for nearly a year. Now 18, Lebert is being published in America, where he will earn the distinction, rare in literary history, of not getting served at his own book party.</p>
        <p>Certain art forms favor the young. It's not surprising that Britney Spears is a success at 18. Britney Spears is a success because she's 18. Pop stars are meant to be looked at and, for that, youth is always a plus. True, Tom Jones has a new hit in Europe called ''Sex Bomb.'' But watch the video of the 59-year-old crooner and the song's title takes on a new meaning.</p>
        <p>It's less obvious why youth should be a recommendation in literature. After all, except for a photo on the dust jacket, the reader may easily ignore the state of authorial decrepitude. Then again, being young is itself a talent, a knack for responding freshly to things. The Wunderkind doesn't have to be the equal of his grown-up colleagues. He or she only has to express what it feels like to be young today to those of us who no longer are.</p>
        <p>''Crazy'' is told in the first person by a teenage boy with the same name as the author. Usually, with a book written from the point of view of an adolescent, the first question to ask is, is the voice credible? Lebert gets a pass on this. Anything he writes is, by definition, pitch perfect. This is the novel's main achievement. It is narrated by a 16-year-old and sounds like it.</p>
        <p>The plot, like the prose, is simple. Benni (short for Benjamin) arrives at a boarding school after having been thrown out of a series of others. There, he falls in with a band of boys. Over the course of one night, these boys sneak into the girls' dormitory and drink a lot of alcohol, and Benni has his first sexual encounter. Later on, the boys run away from school and go to Munich, where they get drunk at a topless bar. Benni's grades do not improve. At book's end, he has to leave once again for another school.</p>
        <p>There are the problems you'd expect. Sketchy characterization. Unjustified behavior. The book isn't written so much as it is filled in with a No. 2 pencil. Benni, we are told, suffers from partial paralysis on the left side of his body. As far as the book is concerned, this disability functions as a device to give him ''character'' and to evoke pity in the reader. Because he can't tie shoelaces, Benni has to wear shoes with Velcro straps. His friend Janosch assures him that this is no reason to get upset, but Benni insists: ''I still don't feel comfortable with the sneakers. Probably just have to get used to them.'' The question arises, however, why would Velcro snaps be a novelty to someone partly paralyzed since birth? Wouldn't Benni have had them his whole life? I didn't believe Benni's paralysis for a minute. Imagine my surprise, then, to learn that the real Benjamin Lebert suffers from just such a paralysis! Write what you know, the old adage goes. But that isn't as easy as it sounds. Lebert fails to convince the reader of a condition he in fact possesses.</p>
        <p>Still, no doubt about it, for a 16-year-old to write a novel, to put so many pages together, one following the next, to remember his characters' names, to try his hand at a sex scene, to sit still so long, is an achievement. Lebert's prose, deftly translated by the overmatched Carol Brown Janeway, is without the usual juvenile flaws: the clotted syntax, the chronic cliches. On a purely linguistic level he writes clearly and adequately.</p>
        <p>Mostly, however, what he does is blather on and on. Aside from ''The Catcher in the Rye,'' the influence that kept coming to mind was Quentin Tarantino's ''Pulp Fiction.'' Like the hit men who discuss theological issues in that film, Lebert's band of schoolboys wax philosophic, too.</p>
        <p>'' 'Friends?' croaks Fat Felix. 'So what's friendship?'</p>
        <p>''Janosch thinks. 'Friendship is something inside you,' he says finally. 'You can't see it, but it's there all the same.'</p>
        <p>'' 'Yes, it's there all the same,' interjects Skinny Felix. 'Just the way a day is.'</p>
        <p>'' 'A day?' asks Fat Felix. 'If friendship is supposed to be like a day, what the hell does that make the sun?'</p>
        <p>'' 'Us, of course,' says Skinny Felix. 'We're the sun.' ''</p>
        <p>Near the end of the novel, my suspicions were confirmed. ''Did any of you see 'Pulp Fiction'?'' a character asks. ''Everybody's seen 'Pulp Fiction,' ''another replies.</p>
        <p>Youth is no guarantee of originality. More often, it's a period of imitation. The nice thing about writing is that you begin to look your best on paper when you no longer do in life.</p>
        <p>And if you don't look so good on paper? Then they put your face on the cover, which is where we find the blond, blue-eyed Lebert. It may work. That people would buy a book simply because of the author's youth is, these days, certainly no wonder.</p>
