        <p>Affordable San Francisco</p>
        <p>Q. Our group of seven women will travel to San Francisco next month. Can you recommend any moderately priced hotels? -- Rachel Witmer, Lake Oswego, Ore.</p>
        <p>A. There are a number of moderately priced hotels in the city, but remember that the 14 percent tax must be added to the rates below.</p>
        <p>The Sam Wong Hotel, 615 Broadway, (415) 362-2999, fax (415) 362-1808, has 81 rooms, not far from Coit Tower, at the Chinatown-North Beach border. After a recent renovation, the rooms have Florentine wallpaper and cherrywood furniture in a Ming style. All have private bath and voice mail. Doubles from $119. On the Web: www.swhotelsf.com.</p>
        <p>For a nicely furnished older hotel (the building dates from 1926) near Union Square, there is the Pickwick, 85 Fifth Street; (415) 421-7500, fax (415) 243-8066. The 189 rooms are done in French Provincial style and all have private bath. Standard doubles are $99 to $189, depending on demand; discounts are often available when booking in advance.</p>
        <p>Away from downtown, facing Golden Gate Park, you can try the  Stanyan Park Hotel, 750 Stanyan Street, (415) 751-1000, fax (415) 668-5454. This 36-room hotel on the edge of Haight-Ashbury is in a registered landmark building dating from 1905. The rooms have period furniture, and some have pencil-post beds. All have private bath. Doubles from $110; www.stanyanpark.com.</p>
        <p>If you don't mind accommodations with shared bath, you may want to  consider a bed-and-breakfast inn. The Casa Arguello, 225 Arguello Boulevard, telephone and fax (415) 752-9482, is in a large 1920's building  where the Pacific Heights, Laurel Heights and Richmond districts come together. It has four double rooms, two with shared bath ($66) and two with private bath ($90 to $110), as well as a large suite accommodating up to five ($135 for two people, $155 for three, $175 for four, $195 for five). Decor is a mix of pastels, brass and some antiques; www.sftravel.com/casarg.html.</p>
        <p>Small Ship, Big State</p>
        <p>Q. I am interested in small-ship cruises to Alaska. Can you give me the names of companies offering such voyages? -- Janet Hitschler, Commack, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A. You have a number of choices. Cruise West, for example, has a fleet of seven ships, ranging in passenger capacity from 52 to 102. Its selection of sailings ranges from three-night trips through the Alaskan fjords to a 15-night excursion that includes three nights in the Denali Park Lodge. The trips have naturalists on board and offer a good range of shore excursions. A three-night cruise on Prince William Sound starts at $875 a person, double occupancy, including all taxes, fees and port charges. The 15-night cruise-land tour starts at $5,245. Call (800) 888-9378 for brochures or visit www.cruisewest.com.</p>
        <p>Glacier Bay Tours and Cruises, with a fleet of four ships carrying from 34 to 88 passengers, conducts typical port-to-port cruises on the Inside Passage as well as cruises for the more adventuresome, featuring sea kayaking and Zodiac excursions in wilderness areas. The company also operates Glacier Bay Lodge, the only hotel in Glacier Bay. Prices start at $1,530 a person, double occupancy, for a five-night cruise to $3,580 for seven nights. Contact (800) 451-5952 or on the Web visit  www.glacierbaytours.com.</p>
        <p>American Safari Cruises uses vessels that carry 12 or 21 passengers, small enough to explore narrow inlets and bays. Because of this more-intimate size, the rates are higher. An eight-night cruise through the Inside Passage, from Juneau to Prince Rupert, or the reverse, for $5,195 to $7,395 a person, double occupancy, depending on cabin and date. These rates include all meals, shore excursions, wine and drinks, taxes and port charges. In September, a 10-night Inside Passage cruise will cost from $4,895 to $6,595. Contact www. amsafari.com; (888) 862-8881.</p>
        <p>French Car Museums</p>
        <p>Q. We will be going to the French Grand Prix auto race at the Magny-Cours track, near Nevers, in July and then plan to meander through Burgundy, ending up in Nice. We will visit the Ligier Museum of racing cars at the track and have already visited the car museum near Mougins. Do you know of any other auto museums along our route? -- Susan Sawyer, Oakland, Calif.</p>
        <p>A. There are a few along the way, as well as one that you may want to make a detour for.</p>
        <p>Close to Vezelay in Burgundy  is the Musee de Voitures des  Chefs d'Etat, in the Chateau de Montjalin in Sauvigny-le-Bois; (33-3) 86.34.46.42, fax (33-3) 86.31.66.83. This is a collection of 30 cars used by various heads of state from 1940 to 1965. Among them are a 1939 Renault Vivistella (Marshal Petain), a Lincoln Continental (President Kennedy), a 1959 Simca Presidence (Charles de Gaulle) and a Pope mobile used by Paul VI. Open daily May 1 to Nov. 11; admission: $4.25 at 7.1 francs to the dollar.</p>
        <p>About three miles north of Beaune is another museum in a castle, the Musee du Chateau de Savigny, in Savigny-les-Beaune. The 14th-century castle contains 200 motorcycles from 1903 to 1960 and 14 Abarth racing cars. Open daily; (33-3) 80.21.55.03. Admission: $5.65.</p>
        <p>As you head farther south toward Nice, just north of Lyons is the Musee Henri-Malartre, (33-4) 78.22.18.80, at the entrance to Rochetaillee-sur-Saone. Old cars must have an affinity for castles, because this collection of 140 cars and 40 motorcycles is in a restored 15th-century chateau. There are 50 cars from before 1914, and 18 were built in Lyons, an early car-manufacturing center. There's another car here used by de Gaulle, and a Renault Espace used by another frequent traveler, Pope John Paul II. It is open daily. Admission: $5.</p>
        <p>Although Mulhouse is a considerable detour off your route, if you can get there, you will find the Musee  National de l'Automobile -- Collection Schlumpf, the premier car collection in France and one of the world's largest, with over 500 cars. Not all are on display at one time, but the ones that are trace the history of motoring, starting with an 1878 steam-driven Jacquot. The highlights are the 120 Bugattis, built in Molsheim. There are 120 racing, luxury and sports models, including the enormous and extremely rare Bugatti Royale. The museum, at 192, avenue de Colmar, Mulhouse, is open  daily (except Tuesday in winter); (33-3) 89.33.23.23, fax (33-3) 89.32.08.90. $8.50.</p>
