        <p>MOTHERS aren't what they used to be. When I was a child, all mothers were huge and terrifying and agelessly old. They had voices like the Greek hero Stentor and the disciplinary habits of the Hindu goddess Kali. I had no trouble believing that they were all direct descendants of the original mother-goddess of antiquity and shared her terrible powers.</p>
        <p>The modern moms I see waiting to pick up their children from the school bus are not at all like the mothers I remember. They seem kinder and gentler, slimmer and prettier, and alarmingly young. I'm sure my mother was never like that. I don't know why this change happened, but I suspect it has something to do with the magazines at the supermarket checkout, celebrating the virtues of eternal youth and beauty. In the past, once women became mothers they became, well, motherly, or perhaps matriarchal is a better word. But not here, not now, in the eternally youthful 21st century.</p>

        <p>MOTHERS aren't what they used to be. When I was a child, all mothers were huge and terrifying and agelessly old. They had voices like the Greek hero Stentor and the disciplinary habits of the Hindu goddess Kali. I had no trouble believing that they were all direct descendants of the original mother-goddess of antiquity and shared her terrible powers.</p>
        <p>The modern moms I see waiting to pick up their children from the school bus are not at all like the mothers I remember. They seem kinder and gentler, slimmer and prettier, and alarmingly young. I'm sure my mother was never like that. I don't know why this change happened, but I suspect it has something to do with the magazines at the supermarket checkout, celebrating the virtues of eternal youth and beauty. In the past, once women became mothers they became, well, motherly, or perhaps matriarchal is a better word. But not here, not now, in the eternally youthful 21st century.</p>
        <p>The American tradition of having Mothers' Day in May is symbolically all wrong. It confuses motherhood with springtime and happiness and sex, which, as any mother will tell you, have nothing at all to do with it. So the modern mother gets no respect and can scarcely hope for a humble visit, a potted geranium and a Mother's Day card.</p>
        <p>Some sociologist should carry out a study of Mother's Day cards. My own unscientific survey at three different stores showed that, on her special day, a mother is very likely to be assaulted by vividly colored and badly executed flower paintings, usually roses or tulips. If she is lucky, she may get cute bunnies or ducklings, a strange hangover from Easter.</p>
        <p>Most of these cards are designed to make up for a year of neglect, so there is a nervous, defensive tone about the messages. They lack the qualities of irony and satire found in so many other greeting cards. The adjective most frequently employed to describe mother is ''special,'' which can scarcely get you in trouble. Superlatives like ''Best Mom'' and ''Unique Mom'' appear on many cards although, grammatically speaking, only one best or unique mother in the world could qualify for this distinction.</p>
        <p>There used to be hundreds of of songs about mothers: ''Mammy'';  ''A Boy's Best Friend Is His Mother''; ''Ma, He's Making Eyes at Me''; ''My Yiddishe Momme''; ''Your Mother Should Know.'' But mothers have almost vanished from popular music.</p>
        <p>It's no accident that songs celebrating mother started fading out in the 50's, just when mothers were liberating themselves. The new style of motherhood was warm and permissive, and mothers everywhere embraced the do-as-you-please child rearing system of Dr. Benjamin Spock.</p>
        <p>The policy of the old-fashioned mother was: you do as I please. Mother always knew best. She fought the good fight against the forces of chaos, represented by dirt and germs, husbands and children and cats. And she prevailed.</p>
        <p>Fathers and sons were a constant challenge to her orderly regime. In particular, she disapproved of their tendency to drift away. The whole nature of motherhood was to stay, to anchor the family and keep it safe. Mothers were fixed in place, almost paralyzed by their enormous responsibilities. Men have this idiotic desire to rush off, to migrate or to explore or to conquer something; -- it doesn't matter what. The only thing that saves the world from total chaos is that mothers can sometimes persuade their boys to stay home and behave.</p>
        <p>If mothers had had their way, the great migrations of history would never have happened. The Huns would still be happily herding their goats out in central Asia, the Visigoths would be eating sausages in Germany, and the Roman Empire would consist of a few suburban developments on the west coast of Italy. If mothers had been in charge, America would never have been discovered. You can imagine Columbus's mother grabbing him by the ruff as he headed out to where the Santa Maria was parked.</p>
        <p>''Come back here, Christopher,'' she would have said. ''The goat needs milking, and we have 200 pounds of olives to stuff. So just forget that nonsense about finding the Indies.''</p>
        <p>But the most important role of mother is to instill in her children a general, all-purpose sense of guilt. Guilt, as Freud revealed, is the cement that holds civilization together, and we owe it all to mother. That's an enormous debt. As you deliver your bunch of tulips and sentimental card this morning, don't forget to feel guilty about it.</p>
