        <p>IN ancient Rome, all wheel traffic was banned within city limits for a 10-hour period beginning at dawn. Consequently, throughout the night a steady traffic of wagons and carts thundered through narrow, twisted alleyways, drovers caught in nocturnal traffic jams hurled  Latin oaths, and tenement dwellers in urban apartments suffered chronic insomnia.  ''Unbroken nights,'' wrote the poet Juvenal in the first century A.D., ''are a rich man's privilege.''</p>
        <p>Two thousand years later, little has changed. Alleys are still narrow, albeit lined nowadays with parked cars. And garbage trucks ply their trade before dawn and after dark. During a recent stay at a friend's apartment in Rome, I noted that garbage from one side of her building was picked up -- or rather slam-dunked -- precisely at 7 a.m., while garbage on the other side was collected at 7:10. This interval allowed just enough time for me to fall back to sleep so that I could be awakened not once but twice each morning by the garbage collectors.  Titans with tambourines could not have matched their din.</p>

        <p>IN ancient Rome, all wheel traffic was banned within city limits for a 10-hour period beginning at dawn. Consequently, throughout the night a steady traffic of wagons and carts thundered through narrow, twisted alleyways, drovers caught in nocturnal traffic jams hurled  Latin oaths, and tenement dwellers in urban apartments suffered chronic insomnia.  ''Unbroken nights,'' wrote the poet Juvenal in the first century A.D., ''are a rich man's privilege.''</p>
        <p>Two thousand years later, little has changed. Alleys are still narrow, albeit lined nowadays with parked cars. And garbage trucks ply their trade before dawn and after dark. During a recent stay at a friend's apartment in Rome, I noted that garbage from one side of her building was picked up -- or rather slam-dunked -- precisely at 7 a.m., while garbage on the other side was collected at 7:10. This interval allowed just enough time for me to fall back to sleep so that I could be awakened not once but twice each morning by the garbage collectors.  Titans with tambourines could not have matched their din.</p>
        <p>And then there were the recycling bins.  Twice a week, just after I'd fallen asleep, the recycling truck would rumble down the street and wheeze to a stop next to the plastic bin outside the building. Hydraulic-powered clamps would hurl a weekend's worth of wine bottles high into the air so that they tumbled onto the metal truck bed in an avalanche of broken glass.</p>
        <p>Sandwiched between garbage collection and the recycling trucks were ordinary nighttime noises. The chimes from nearby Sant'Agnese on the Via Nomentana struck each quarter hour. Truck drivers drove down the street backward so that they could test their automatic warning systems. And car alarms blared so frequently that I half-expected all the cars to be gone by morning.</p>
        <p>''How can anyone sleep?'' I asked my host.</p>
        <p>''Romans don't mind noise,'' she explained. ''It's silence that makes us uneasy.  Silence means something is broken or somebody's on strike.'' The most frightening part of the 1980 earthquake in southern Italy, she went on to explain, was the silence that came at the very end.</p>
        <p>Later that week, I visited Rome's newest exhibition space, the Scuderie Papali, or Papal stables, on the Piazza Quirinale. The stunning transformation from stable to art gallery was the work of the Italian designer Gae Aulenti, best known for her renovation of the Gare d'Orsay into the Musee d'Orsay in Paris. I was particularly intrigued by the security system. Electric eyes beeped if anyone got too close to the artworks. Few of the hundreds of patrons noted a connection between their actions and the continual beeping. Newly hired guards scurried about the galleries in frantic attempts to educate visitors. But to little avail. The beeps  persisted as a sort of atonal accompaniment to the art, which, fortunately, was mostly  modern.</p>
        <p>I should not have been surprised by this  benevolence toward noise. Years ago my husband, David, and I spent our first night in Italy in a little fishing village on an island, the Isola dei Pescatori in Lake Maggiore. It would have been difficult to find a more tranquil setting. What we hadn't realized was that the final match of the World Cup soccer tournament was scheduled for that evening. When all the waiters disappeared halfway through dinner, we gathered that Italy was playing.</p>
        <p>Later that night, when the noise began, we figured that Italy had won. We raced to the window and watched a barrage of fireworks on the shoreline, not from isolated parking lots or spacious fields but from every rooftop in Stresa. Car horns came on and stayed on. Voices from dozens of megaphones boomed across the cool surface of the lake.  And it continued until dawn.</p>
        <p>Given my commitment to eight hours a night, I should have taken this as a warning and traveled elsewhere. Instead, over the years, I have been drawn like a moth to this land of high fidelity, where saints' days, liberation remembrances, and unification celebrations fuel a constant stream of fireworks throughout the year and where decibels register with a particularly rich resonance. Predictably, my sleep has suffered.</p>
        <p>On a visit several years ago to Syracuse in Sicily, I had a hotel room below the marble-floored rooftop restaurant. I didn't mind the piano music that started at 11:30 p.m., but I did mind the cocktail waitress with stiletto heels. While sonically tracking her route from bar to table to piano, I had ample time to reflect upon my growing irritation. By the time I finally drifted off, I felt that I knew those shoes intimately -- their size, their height, even their color.</p>
        <p>The next morning I mentioned the situation to the desk clerk, who seemed unable to grasp the problem.</p>
        <p>''But you should have come up for a drink,'' he finally replied with exasperation.  I probably should have.</p>
        <p>On another occasion I spent several nights at a guest house near the archaeological ruins of Cuma on the Bay of Naples. No cocktail waitress, no piano bars. Instead, it was dogs, dozens of dogs throughout the countryside, each chained to its own garden gate, yelping throughout the night. I asked at breakfast if the dogs barked like that every night.</p>
        <p>The cook, who hadn't actually heard them, said it might have been the moon and then shrugged, ''Dogs bark.''</p>
        <p>And people, she might have added, talk, especially if they're Italian. Consider the following episode.</p>
        <p>A friend of mine boarded the express train from Rome to Milan. Having settled into her seat, she pulled out a novel, hoping it would last the length of the trip. An Italian businessman took the seat opposite her, and moments later another businessman sat down next to her. The two men, who she felt certain did not know each other, struck up an immediate conversation, like tennis players booked for a match.</p>
        <p>BUT this was no best of three. It continued seamlessly for the next five hours: no hiccup, no pause, no moment of contemplation. They talked while the conductor punched their tickets, they talked in the pitch black of tunnels, they talked until the train pulled into the station in Milan, where they collected their bags and went their separate ways.</p>
        <p>In this land of constant chatter, the one remaining bastion of silence is the Church, where discourse is meant to be of a spiritual nature, and never more so than during the current Holy Year when tens of millions of pilgrims are expected to visit.</p>
        <p>This past March, while visiting the Sistine Chapel, I noted that new battle lines had been drawn. In the final corridor leading into the chapel, voice recordings in a variety  of languages barked stern admonitions against talking. Inside the chapel, a battalion of guards enforced gag orders with a zeal not practiced since the time of the Inquisition. This strict mandate for silence extended beyond the shadow of St. Peter's.</p>
        <p>Days later at the Basilica of St. Francis in Assisi, we were greeted by a monk in rough-hewn cassock and sandals. ''Silenzio'' he mimed to us. Each time we stopped to whisper, our monk would miraculously reappear, his index finger pressed to his mouth. Here truly was a man of faith. Without uniformed guards, hidden beepers or recorded messages, he was determined nevertheless to preserve a silent haven in an otherwise noisy world.</p>
