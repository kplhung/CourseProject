        <p>Q. When one of the Mets hits a home run, television cameras zoom in on the giant red apple that rises, flashing, from the upside-down top hat by the scoreboard in center field. Did it have a previous life as a parade float or theatrical prop?</p>
        <p>A. Though it does have that lumpy, homemade quality one tends to associate with a high school production of  ''Gulliver's Travels,'' the Home Run Apple, as it is known, was specifically built for Shea Stadium as part of the Mets' promotional campaign for 1980, the year that Doubleday &amp; Company bought the last-place franchise for $21.1 million. Where the words ''Home Run'' now blink on and off, the apple originally carried the team's blustery motto that season: ''The Magic Is Back.''</p>

        <p>Q. When one of the Mets hits a home run, television cameras zoom in on the giant red apple that rises, flashing, from the upside-down top hat by the scoreboard in center field. Did it have a previous life as a parade float or theatrical prop?</p>
        <p>A. Though it does have that lumpy, homemade quality one tends to associate with a high school production of  ''Gulliver's Travels,'' the Home Run Apple, as it is known, was specifically built for Shea Stadium as part of the Mets' promotional campaign for 1980, the year that Doubleday &amp; Company bought the last-place franchise for $21.1 million. Where the words ''Home Run'' now blink on and off, the apple originally carried the team's blustery motto that season: ''The Magic Is Back.''</p>
        <p>The ''magic'' theme at least explains the top hat, a 10-foot tall, kettle-like cylinder with a rim, constructed of quarter-inch plywood and painted matte black. The levitating apple, about nine feet in diameter, is built of plaster and lath, and can be  raised or lowered in about 30 seconds by an electric motor. It is controlled by three buttons (marked ''up,'' ''down'' and ''stop'') in a booth in the press area. It has a stem, made from a real tree stump, and a leaf. ''The leaf was actually missing for several years, until I found it sitting in a storeroom and reattached it,'' said Kevin McCarthy, director of stadium operations for the Mets.</p>
        <p>The magic, as it turned out, did not return to Flushing in 1980, and the slogan, created by the Manhattan advertising firm of Della Femina, Travisano &amp; Partners, was ridiculed after the Mets finished the roller-coaster year with a 67-95 record. Despite occasional talk of removing it, the Home Run Apple has been repaired and repainted before the start of each subsequent season. Mr. Kennedy said it sometimes gets stuck, there are electrical problems and water seeps into it when it rains.</p>
        <p>''The apple is dated, but it's a big fan favorite,'' he said. ''It is what it is.''</p>
        <p>Phantom Routes</p>
        <p>Q. A few weekends ago, I spotted a subway car marked with a ''10'', on a green background, attached to a downtown No. 1 train. The same day, I saw an ''11,'' with a magenta background, on the same track. Were these cars displaying route designations from long ago, or new ones that have yet to be added?</p>
        <p>A. New ones, which have yet to be added to the subway system and, for that matter, might never be. Melissa Farley, a spokeswoman for the M.T.A., said the last of the Bombardier R-62A subway cars delivered to the city in the late 1980's included Mylar route signs with the projected numbers and colors you describe.</p>
        <p>As a practical matter, routes still in the planning stages have frequently been included when new roll signs are produced, she said. Route or destination curtains, as they are called, are adjusted by train operators or car technicians with a key-like instrument; the ones you saw may have been erroneously rolled into the wrong position, she said.</p>
        <p>Among the still-imaginary routes on the R-62A roster: a Lexington Avenue No. 10, a skip-stop 11 train on the Flushing line, and the sinister-sounding No. 13, which would run on the Broadway/Seventh Avenue line.</p>
        <p>Pets, Radio and Prayer</p>
        <p>Q. When I was a child, my father took me to a retail district in lower Manhattan that consisted only of pet shops and pet supply stores. Where was it?</p>
        <p>A. South of Barclay Street, on West Broadway and Greenwich Streets. Like the radio district and the religious supply district, the pet shop district was flattened in the mid-1960's for the construction of the World Trade Center.</p>
