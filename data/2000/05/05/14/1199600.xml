        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The assertion by Paul Krugman (column, May 10) of the current argument that markets have some affinity with open societies and democracy is perfectly wrong. Markets, which predate capitalism, let alone democracy, have coexisted with every social order -- even Communism, with its anti-market ideology.</p>
        <p>If anything, market systems have an affinity for authoritarianism. The most powerful and characteristic institutions of market societies are corporations, which are authoritarian structures specifically designed so that the side with the most money can out-vote the side with the most people.</p>
