        <p>UNTIL recently, people who wanted to sell their homes had two basic options: they could list their home with a broker -- and in most cases pay a six percent commission -- or they could avoid a commission by putting a ''For Sale by Owner'' sign on the front lawn.</p>
        <p>Now, however, with the Internet available to anyone with a computer and a telephone line, the options have increased. Real estate brokers say that homeowners can now fine-tune the marketing of their house -- and determine the commission they will ultimately pay -- by actively participating in the selling process.</p>

        <p>UNTIL recently, people who wanted to sell their homes had two basic options: they could list their home with a broker -- and in most cases pay a six percent commission -- or they could avoid a commission by putting a ''For Sale by Owner'' sign on the front lawn.</p>
        <p>Now, however, with the Internet available to anyone with a computer and a telephone line, the options have increased. Real estate brokers say that homeowners can now fine-tune the marketing of their house -- and determine the commission they will ultimately pay -- by actively participating in the selling process.</p>
        <p>''We provide sellers with the opportunity to market their homes at a fair price and on their own terms,'' said Glenn Cohen, president of YourHomeDirect.com, a real estate brokerage company based in West Long Branch, N.J.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen said that his company offers sellers throughout New Jersey various levels of service for commissions that range from 2 to 3.9 percent. He said that since his company's sales agents are both licensed real estate agents and registered loan officers in New Jersey, they can provide whatever level of service a seller and a buyer need.</p>
        <p>With YourHomeDirect's ''Seller's Choice Package,'' he said, a company sales agents visits the seller's home to get an idea of the size, location and condition. The agent then conducts an analysis of sales of similar homes in the area to give the seller an idea of the appropriate price range.</p>
        <p>Once the price is set and the property is listed with YourHomeDirect, the company then advertises in major newspapers, and lists home on its Internet site (www.yhd.com) and many of the larger real estate Web sites and provides the seller with a yard sign.</p>
        <p>The agent who visits the home will also photograph it to create a virtual tour that can be viewed on the Web site. The listing and the sign will usually have the company telephone number -- rather than the owner's -- and a code number to allow prospective purchasers who have seen the listing or the lawn sign to take the virtual tour of the home on their computer.</p>
        <p>''We prequalify all buyers,'' Mr. Cohen said, adding that once it has been determined that the potential buyer is both serious and qualified, the sales agent contacts the seller to arrange for the house to be shown. ''Then it's up to the sellers to decide whether they want us to show the house or whether they feel comfortable showing it themselves.''</p>
        <p>Any offers that are made, Mr. Cohen said, go through the sales agent, who then negotiates on behalf of the seller. If a deal is struck, he said, the agent does all the things a full-service broker would do, including preparing the necessary paperwork, arranging financing if necessary and scheduling the usual inspections.</p>
        <p>If a seller shows the house himself, Mr. Cohen said, YourHomeDirect charges a 2 percent commission. If the seller prefers having an agent escort buyers through the home, he said, the commission is 3 percent.  And since YourHomeDirect is a licensed real estate broker, it can also submit listings to the local Multiple Listing Service, making it likely that local brokers will bring their potential buyers to the property. The fee for the ''MLS Plan'' is 3.9 percent, Mr. Cohen said, adding that of that amount a 2.5 percent commission is paid to the selling broker, and YourHomeDirect keeps the rest as the listing broker.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cohen added that while his company is now licensed only in New Jersey, he expects to be licensed in New York and Pennsylvania by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>Another company that allows sellers to choose the services they want from a real estate broker is Help-U-Sell, a nationwide franchise company with East Coast headquarters on in Syosset, Long Island.</p>
        <p>''My company is based upon the premise that sellers can save a tremendous amount of money by simply doing some of the work of the sale themselves,'' said Rick O'Neil, president of Help-U-Sell. The company's Web site is www.helpusell.com.</p>
        <p>Mr. O'Neil said that the commission charged by Help-U-Sell franchisees -- a flat fee agreed on in advance between the company and the seller -- usually ends up being anywhere from 2.1 percent to 2.8 percent of the sale price. For that, he said, sellers get their house listed on the company's Web site, a yard sign, and whatever hand-holding they need once an interested buyer shows up.</p>
        <p>''We basically do everything a full-service broker would do,'' Mr. O'Neil said, ''except show the house.''</p>
        <p>Another Internet-based company that caters to sellers who would rather not pay a full 6 percent commission is the Realty Exchange Network in Ossining, N.Y. ''What we're doing is creating a portal that will provide instant access to discount real estate brokers across the country,'' said James Troia, president of the company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Troia said the company recently entered into agreements with 23 large discount brokerage companies in which the companies automatically post all their listings on the Realty Exchange Network's Web site, www.REXnetwork.com.</p>
        <p>''This is definitely the wave of the future,'' Mr. Troia said.</p>
        <p>One place that wave is unlikely to hit with any real force, however, is Manhattan. Frederick Peters, president of Ashforth Warburg, a Manhattan full-service brokerage, said that while discount brokers who have access to a local Multiple Listing Service may be attractive to some sellers, they will likely have little success in Manhattan's co-op and condominium market.</p>
        <p>''The process that brokers have to go through here is much more complicated than it is in the suburbs,'' Mr. Peters said. ''You really do need an experienced broker who is able to screen buyers not only for sellers and lenders, but for co-op boards as well.''</p>
        <p>He explained that it is unlikely that a discount broker who does not have an intimate understanding of the co-op and condominium market would be able to provide the level of service  needed to usher such deals through to completion.</p>
        <p>In fact, he said, even sellers of luxury homes outside Manhattan have grown used to having their brokers provide them with copious amounts of personal service and attention.  And it is unlikely, Mr. Peters said, that such sellers would be willing to compromise on the level of service they are accustomed to in exchange for paying a lower commission.</p>
        <p>''There are lots of people who can drive a car who don't mind paying to have a driver,'' he said. ''It's really a question of how you can best use your time.''</p>
