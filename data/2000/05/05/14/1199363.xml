        <p>ONE spring a few years ago I stopped at a farm with my son, who was then about 5, to buy some seedlings. Behind the barn was an enormous field full of young spinach, and we were told we could pick our own. When we got home I showed him how to make a dressing I knew he would like because it contained soy sauce. It was my sneaky way of getting him to eat spinach, and since then we've had this salad many times.</p>
        <p>Despite the fact that most children won't have it in the house, spinach is the most widely grown green vegetable in the United States, at its best in spring and fall, when the temperature is cool. It should be bright and squeaky, the leaves dark green, not yellow or withered. Small tender leaves are good for salads, the thicker ones for cooking.</p>

        <p>ONE spring a few years ago I stopped at a farm with my son, who was then about 5, to buy some seedlings. Behind the barn was an enormous field full of young spinach, and we were told we could pick our own. When we got home I showed him how to make a dressing I knew he would like because it contained soy sauce. It was my sneaky way of getting him to eat spinach, and since then we've had this salad many times.</p>
        <p>Despite the fact that most children won't have it in the house, spinach is the most widely grown green vegetable in the United States, at its best in spring and fall, when the temperature is cool. It should be bright and squeaky, the leaves dark green, not yellow or withered. Small tender leaves are good for salads, the thicker ones for cooking.</p>
        <p>Spinach soup is fast and easy to make, but you cannot hold it for long or it loses its bright green color. The spinach is added to hot chicken stock just long enough to wilt, and then it is pureed (vegetarians can use plain water instead of stock). The soup is served sprinkled with Parmesan, extra-virgin olive oil and garlic croutons. It is also good with a dollop of creme fraiche.</p>
        <p>At Cafe Boulud, Chef Daniel Boulud serves a spring chicken and spinach salad that he calls ''thoroughly French.'' The dressing, a mixture of the chicken cooking juices with shallots and sherry vinegar, is whisked in the pan. Baby artichokes, tarragon and basil are added at the end. Mr. Boulud says that, served with a loaf of country bread, this makes a good family supper dish.</p>
        <p>In my house, however, we would have to sprinkle in some soy sauce.</p>
        <p>Spinach Salad  Total time: 20 minutes</p>
        <p>1 pound young spinach leaves, washed and drained  1 teaspoon soy sauce  1 tablespoon lemon juice  1 clove garlic, crushed  2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar (or to taste)  1 tablespoon sesame oil</p>
        <p>1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil  Coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Wash and spin dry the spinach leaves. Put them in a large salad bowl.</p>
        <p>2. Combine the soy sauce, lemon juice, garlic and vinegar. Gradually whisk in the oils. Season to taste with salt and pepper and remove the garlic clove.</p>
        <p>3. Pour the dressing over the spinach leaves. Toss, correct seasoning and serve.  Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Spinach Soup  Total time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>1 large carrot, diced  1 stalk celery, diced  1 clove garlic, diced  1 medium yellow onion, diced  3 tablespoons unsalted butter or olive oil  5 cups chicken stock  1 1/2 pounds spinach, stemmed, washed and drained  Coarse sea salt and freshly ground pepper  Freshly grated Parmesan  About 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  Homemade garlic croutons.</p>
        <p>1. In a large stock pot, soften the carrot, celery, garlic and onion in the butter or olive oil. Add the chicken stock, bring to a boil and simmer gently for 20 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Add the spinach and cook for a minute uncovered, stirring all the time, until all the leaves are wilted. Puree immediately in a blender (you will need to do this in batches). Pour the puree into a hot tureen or individual heated soup bowls and season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>3. Sprinkle with cheese, olive oil and croutons and serve at once. If you leave it longer than 15 to 20 minutes, the soup will lose its bright green color.  Yield: 6-8 servings.</p>
        <p>Warm Chicken And Spinach Salad  Total time: 45 minutes</p>
        <p>2/3 cup plus 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil  4 bone-in chicken breasts, skin removed, cut into small strips  Coarse sea salt and freshly ground white pepper  6 baby artichokes, trimmed and quartered  1 clove garlic, peeled and crushed  1 sprig thyme  1 tablespoon water  2 medium shallots, peeled, trimmed, diced, rinsed and dried</p>
        <p>1/4 cup sherry vinegar  2 tablespoons snipped basil leaves  1 tablespoon tarragon leaves, chopped fine  4 plum tomatoes, peeled, seeded and cut into thin strips  8 cups baby spinach, well washed and dried.</p>
        <p>1. Center a rack in the oven and preheat the oven to 400 degrees.</p>
        <p>2. Warm two tablespoons of the olive oil in a large, ovenproof saute pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, and when the oil is hot, slip the breasts, skin side (or what would have been skin side) down into the pan. Sear the chicken on one side until golden (3 to 4 minutes), then turn it over and give the other side equal treatment. Turn the breasts again and slide the pan into the oven. Roast the chicken until it is cooked through, about 12 to 14 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. Meanwhile, warm a tablespoon of the olive oil in a saute pan or skillet over medium-high heat. Add the strips of chicken skin and cook until they start to color lightly. Add the artichokes, garlic and thyme, season with salt and pepper, cover, and cook for three minutes. Lift the lid and stir in the water. Cover the pan and cook for another three to four minutes, until artichokes are tender. Discard the garlic and thyme. Remove the pan from the heat and keep warm.</p>
        <p>4. When the chicken is cooked, transfer it to a cutting board and put the pan over medium heat. Add the shallots to the pan and cook, stirring, until they soften (about two minutes). Pour in the vinegar and scrape up whatever little bits of meat may have adhered to the pan. Reduce the vinegar by half, then whisk in the remaining two-thirds of a cup of olive oil and the herbs. This is the dressing for your salad. Remove the pan from the heat, correct seasoning and stir in the tomatoes.</p>
        <p>5. Put the spinach in a large bowl and season to taste with salt and pepper. Slice the chicken breasts and put the strips, along with the artichokes and pieces of chicken skin, in the bowl. Toss the salad with the warm chicken pan juices and serve immediately.  Yield: 4 servings.</p>
