        <p>HUDSON &amp; McCOY has swept onto the ''nautical mile'' in Freeport like a fresh sea breeze. On Woodcleft Avenue, across the street from the water, where the Tides Restaurant used to be, the newcomer gives an exciting reason to visit this appealing, summery area.</p>
        <p>The restaurant is a three-story charmer that evokes classy fish houses of an earlier era. The walls are dotted with large blackboards listing the evening specials, with bold antique French posters and with a black-and-silver frieze with Art Deco lettering enumerating food and drinks (lobster, gimlets, crabs, and so on). There are high ceilings with exposed heat ducts, swirling fans and old-fashioned lights.</p>

        <p>HUDSON &amp; McCOY has swept onto the ''nautical mile'' in Freeport like a fresh sea breeze. On Woodcleft Avenue, across the street from the water, where the Tides Restaurant used to be, the newcomer gives an exciting reason to visit this appealing, summery area.</p>
        <p>The restaurant is a three-story charmer that evokes classy fish houses of an earlier era. The walls are dotted with large blackboards listing the evening specials, with bold antique French posters and with a black-and-silver frieze with Art Deco lettering enumerating food and drinks (lobster, gimlets, crabs, and so on). There are high ceilings with exposed heat ducts, swirling fans and old-fashioned lights.</p>
        <p>Servers are well meaning, hard-working and numerous, but their efforts produced mixed results. On a busy Saturday, confused runners were delivering dishes to the wrong tables. On every visit they asked those age-old questions: ''Who ordered the salad? the chicken? the baked clams?'' Waiters, on the other hand, noted who had ordered each dish and tried to direct it to the correct place. Someone must have drilled the busboys on pouring water.  One fellow was so diligent he not only topped off nearly full glasses but emptied those that had stood awhile and refilled them with fresh ice water.</p>
        <p>The ordinary semolina loaf of bread (cut your own, placed on a board) is not indicative of the splendid food to come.</p>
        <p>Take the shrimp cocktail. It's a snazzy assembly of five firm jumbos arranged in an ice-filled martini glass and mated with an assertive cocktail sauce.</p>
        <p>Oysters are other pristine picks.  Recently, there was a choice of three varieties, priced by the piece (diners can select as many of each as they like), placed on a bed of ice and served with two sauces.</p>
        <p>Other seafood standards that put in a way-above-par showing were the bacon-flavored, creamy New England chowder, full of clams; the tender baked clams under a light sprinkling of buttery crumbs; clay-pot roasted mussels, sweet and plump; and no-filler crab cakes with zingy Moroccan seasonings.</p>
        <p>A few specials also rang the bell: a grilled portobello glazed with melted taleggio cheese, placed over greens; and lightly charred slices of rare, lush tuna rolled in white and black sesame seeds and presented with salad in a sesame vinaigrette.</p>
        <p>Speaking of salad, the chopped version is the one to order. It includes feta cheese, cucumbers, tomatoes, chickpeas, celery and lightly cooked green beans and carrots. The ordinary Caesar is dull in comparison.</p>
        <p>At entree time, be sure to check out the blackboard specials -- the best fish are found there. Baked halibut placed above a delicious herbed risotto with a sherry beurre blanc and a topknot of frizzled leeks was tops. Chilean sea bass in a citrus crust mated with grilled vegetables and roasted red potatoes was nearly as good. All fish from the menu (salmon and tuna) were cooked correctly and earned praise.</p>
        <p>Lobster shows up on the specials board and makes a fine choice. We tried a one-and-a-half-pound beauty ($27) that was tender and sweet.</p>
        <p>From the menu, fried shrimp and broiled sea scallops in a lemony scampi-style sauce were also fine.</p>
        <p>Landlubbers are not second-class citizens here. The hamburger is thick, juicy and comes with fries, crisp bacon and melted cheese ($9).  A double-cut pork chop, glazed in an orange sauce, with mashed potatoes and spinach is its equal.</p>
        <p>Ordinary cole slaw arrives with all entrees. So, too does a choice of potato or rice. Go with the French fries.  They are terrific: thin, crisp, hot, well seasoned.</p>
        <p>There are no duds among the desserts, either. The homemade apple tarte Tatin is thin, crisp and served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce. Equal amounts of praise were heaped on the warm pecan pie, tangy Key lime pie and rich chocolate earthquake cake. Junior's cheesecake is offered and was as creamy as remembered.  Still, I was surprised that a marbled (chocolate swirl) cake was served rather than the expected classic.</p>
