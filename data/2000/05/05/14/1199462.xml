        <p>In a May 7 news article about education legislation, Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire, is quoted as saying that with 35 years of Democratic programs ''we've had 35 years of kids who haven't been able to read or write.''

What he and other critics of our troubled schools conveniently ignore is that insufficient efforts have been made to convert these schools into quality ones.</p>
        <p>If lawmakers sincerely wish to give our disadvantaged children their human right to a good education, they will support legislation to pay for enrolling all 3-year-olds in Head Start, smaller classes, buildings to house those classes, intensive tutoring, teacher development and increased teacher salaries. We would no longer be misled with charter schools and unconstitutional vouchers.</p>
