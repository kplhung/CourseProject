      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Watching Ridley Scott's audience-immersing Roman epic, ''Gladiator,'' the first blockbuster of the summer movie season, at times feels like you have gone camping with the Versaces. The story of Maximus (Russell Crowe), a soldier-turned-slave-turned-gladiator, is a study in maximalist style. The lavish costumes designed by Janty Yates -- body armor for men, body jewelry for women, body fur for everyone -- take their cues from the work of the English painter Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema. The result is ''a Roman look with pre-Raphaelite overtones,'' Ms. Yates said last week via cell phone from the streets of Florence, where she is doing the costumes for ''Hannibal,'' Mr. Scott's sequel to ''Silence of the Lambs.'' But while ''Gladiator'' is set in A.D. 180, many of the clothes and accessories mirror current runway trends: Lucilla (Connie Nielsen), the emperor's daughter, is done up in pearl-beaded wraps and exquisite headbands that could easily be worn this summer. Her dresses, laced over the bodice, are reminiscent of the bikinis at Gucci; and armbands are just like those seen on stars like Cate Blanchett at the Academy Awards. Of course, fashion-conscious moviegoers know that period movies always say as much about the period in which they're made as they do about the period in which they're set. As for the men, the designer eschewed the embarrassingly short lengths that resulted in so many bare legs in ''Spartacus'' and ''Ben Hur'' during the last great round of toga movies. ''We made sure the men's tunics were more like Scottish kilts -- more funky and macho,'' Ms. Yates said. Where was she when Charlton Heston needed her?</p>
