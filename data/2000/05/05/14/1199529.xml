        <p>As the nation's capital and other cities prepared for Mother's Day demonstrations favoring stricter gun control laws, President Clinton said the events on Sunday would show that the gun lobby ''is no match for America's moms.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton used his regularly scheduled radio address today to praise the Million Mom March, the label organizers have given to nationwide demonstrations. The organizers expected to draw about 150,000 people to the main march in Washington. The president has repeatedly spoken out for the march in the past few days, urging Congress to act on gun control legislation.</p>
        <p>A counterdemonstration is also scheduled on Sunday in Washington by a group of women who oppose new controls on guns. While the larger crowd occupies the huge grassy Mall at the foot of Capitol Hill, the counterdemonstrators, sponsored by a Dallas group called the Second Amendment Sisters, will march nearby up Constitution Avenue to the Capitol.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the Million Mom March have said it is not, as organizers characterize it, a true grass-roots movement but rather a political operation in masquerade. But while some political figures, including Hillary Rodham Clinton, are expected to join in the march, the featured speakers are to be ordinary people whose lives have been shattered by gun violence.</p>
        <p>''Many of the organizers have lost children of their own and other loved ones to gunfire,'' said Mr. Clinton, who met some organizers at the White House recently as part of his publicity campaign on the gun issue.</p>
        <p>At the same time, the march is striking a deep chord in women who have not been touched by gun violence, but who simply fear for the safety of their children.</p>
        <p>Among them is Caren Appel, a 38-year-old mother of three from Atlanta. After coordinating a companion Million Mom March in that city, she brought her family to Washington this weekend for the main demonstration.</p>
        <p>''It was my way of showing complete support for this movement,'' Mrs. Appel said. ''I just felt that I personally needed to do something so that there were no more shootings in schools. I want my children to be safe.''</p>
        <p>Although Mrs. Appel said she felt ''lucky that gun violence hasn't hit me,'' she said she did have a scare recently. Her 8-year-old daughter went to visit a friend, and came home to report that children in the house had produced ''the family gun,'' which they claimed was real. Mrs. Appel did not pursue the issue with the other parents.</p>
        <p>But, she said, ''From now on, if I do not know the family, I will ask if there is a gun in the house, and I will ask if it is locked up, and then I will decide.''</p>
        <p>Organizers of the counterdemonstration said that their keynote speaker would be Suzanna Gratia-Hupp, a state representative from Texas whose parents were among 21 people killed in a rampage shooting at a restaurant in 1991. She has said that she might have shot the assailant and prevented the massacre if she had been allowed by law to carry her legally owned sidearm into the restaurant.</p>
        <p>In his speech, President Clinton credited the Million Mom March as ''a gras-sroots effort that has already put stronger laws in place in states like California, Massachusetts and Maryland. They're letting the gun lobby know it is no match for America's moms. But our nationwide fight won't be over tomorrow, no matter how many march. We have so much work still to do.''</p>
        <p>The legislation Mr. Clinton favors would close a loophole allowing the sale of some firearms at gun shows without full background checks of the buyers; mandate child safety locks with every handgun sold; ban high capacity ammunition clips; bar the most violent juveniles from possessing firearms as adults; and hold adults accountable if they allow children access to guns. He has also proposed research on safer ''smart guns'' and a state-based licensing system, and sought $280 million for increasing enforcement of gun laws.</p>
        <p>The National Rifle Association has countered with a pledge to spend an additional $1 million on gun safety education in elementary schools.</p>
