        <p>The Consolations</p>
        <p>of Philosophy</p>
        <p>By Alain de Botton.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 265 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Pantheon Books. $22.95.</p>
        <p>On a plane over the Atlantic a few years ago Alain de Botton looked down at a postcard of ''The Death of Socrates,'' by Jacques-Louis David, and, as he describes it, had a life-changing experience. Socrates' ''independence of mind was a revelation and an incitement,'' he writes; it seemed ''to offer an invitation to take on a task at once profound and laughable: to become wise through philosophy.''</p>
        <p>''If the postcard struck me so forcefully,'' he had noted, ''it was perhaps because the behavior it depicted contrasted so sharply with my own. In conversations, my priority was to be liked, rather than to speak the truth. A desire to please led me to laugh at modest jokes like a parent on the opening night of a school play. With strangers, I adopted the servile manner of a concierge greeting wealthy clients in a hotel -- salival enthusiasm born of a morbid, indiscriminate desire for affection. I did not publicly doubt ideas to which the majority was committed. I sought the approval of figures of authority and after encounters with them, worried at length whether they had thought me acceptable.''</p>
        <p>''The Consolations of Philosophy'' supposedly issues from an existential change of heart. My problem as a reader is that the book has persuaded me that the conversion story, though charming, isn't true. There is no love of truth in this book, and thus no real change of character could have led to its production.</p>
        <p>There is a need for someone to bring that joyful activity of mind we call philosophy to the wider reading public. And de Botton, the author of ''How Proust Can Change Your Life,'' writes with verve. Academic philosophy in the United States has virtually abandoned the attempt to speak to the culture at large, but philosophy professors are doing something of incredible importance: they are trying to get things right. That is the thread that connects them back to Socrates -- even if they are not willing to follow him into the marketplace -- and that is the thread that ''The Consolations of Philosophy'' cuts.</p>
        <p>Indeed, de Botton's Socrates, for all the huffing and puffing about his greatness, is indistinguishable from a second-rate sophist. He is merely someone who questioned common-sense conventions and got people angry. How could anyone think that a world-historical figure could emerge by taking such a small step from timid conformity? The picture not only flattens Socrates, it trivializes the concerns of the populace. The ancient Greeks, de Botton says, ''would have been confounded and angered to be asked exactly why they sacrificed cocks to Asclepius or why men needed to kill to be virtuous.'' In fact, the Greeks had plenty to say about why sacrifice was important and why it was important to achieve glory in war. Generalizing to today, de Botton continues, ''If we refrain from questioning the status quo, it is -- aside from the weather and the size of our cities -- primarily because we associate what is popular with what is right.''</p>
        <p>But who, then, are we? In Britain, where de Botton lives part of the time, the election of Margaret Thatcher brought about a giant transformation of social, economic and educational structure. There is very little that one could continue to call ''the status quo.'' The United States has seen huge shifts in social and economic opportunities for women, changes in race relations; the Internet may be ushering in an economic revolution. Above all, we are a country that allows social transformations -- desegregation, legalized abortion, uncoerced confessions -- to issue from lawsuits. The social institution of the lawsuit is the embodiment of the idea that we, as a culture, do not simply associate what is popular with what is right. Obviously, in a democracy there is always danger of the intolerance of the group, and mass media and consumer culture do instill pressures to conform. But de Botton's ''we'' is not us; it is the cliche of a herd.</p>
        <p>Still, according to de Botton, if you want to leave the herd, it is easy enough: ''Anyone with a curious and well-ordered mind who seeks to evaluate a common-sense belief can start a conversation with a friend in a city street and, by following a Socratic method, may arrive at one or two groundbreaking ideas in under half an hour.'' Only two? The account of the Socratic method is of such stunning banality -- find a common-sense generalization and then find a counterexample, make a new generalization and continue the process -- that it would seem the only reason every one of us hasn't become another Socrates is that the activity is too boring to endure. Socrates clearly did look for counterexamples, but there is no understanding of the context. Nor is there any understanding of how Alcibiades, in Plato's ''Symposium,'' could call Socrates unique in all of human existence.</p>
        <p>If there is no philosophy here, there is no consolation to be had from philosophy. As a consolation for feelings of intellectual inadequacy, de Botton raises Montaigne's question -- What good did their great erudition do for Varro and Aristotle? Did it free them from human ills?'' -- and sets out to help us ''understand why the two men could have been both so erudite and so unhappy.'' He then criticizes an institution of higher learning: ''It excelled at imparting learning but failed entirely at imparting wisdom -- repeating at an institutional level the errors that had marred the personal lives of Varro and Aristotle.'' The only problem is that there isn't a shred of evidence that Aristotle was an unhappy man. De Botton has moved from a rhetorical question to an established fact in one sentence.</p>
        <p>Indeed, all the evidence we do have suggests that Aristotle took himself to have lived a profoundly happy life. In the ''Nicomachean Ethics,'' he argues that the best and happiest human life is one that is oriented toward contemplation. Obviously, he may have had problems we don't know about, but that's just it: we don't know about them. In effect, de Botton invites us to take comfort in the thought that a person of profound mind and astounding intellectual accomplishment wasn't really happy -- in spite of the fact that all available evidence suggests he was really happy and it was precisely his intellectual activity that contributed to his happiness. This is not a consolation of philosophy, it is the consolation of envy and ressentiment.</p>
        <p>In general, de Botton's consolations are worthy of Polonius. In consolation for not having enough money, we are told that ''expensive things cannot bring us remarkable joy'' (while ignoring the crucial question of whether they might contribute to our joy). As a consolation for frustration: ''The wise will learn to identify what is necessary and follow it at once, rather than exhaust themselves in protest.'' At the beginning of a chapter on sexual inadequacy, we are told that it is problematic ''to have both a body and a mind, for the former stands in almost monstrous contrast to the latter's dignity and intelligence.'' But at the end of the chapter we are given this consolation: ''True wisdom must involve an accommodation with our baser selves, it must adopt a modest view about the role that intelligence and high culture can play in any life and accept the urgent and at times deeply unedifying demands of our mortal frame.'' And so on.</p>
        <p>IN the chapter on sexual inadequacy, de Botton tells us of a friend of Montaigne's who ''had grown impotent after failing to achieve the unwavering rational command over his penis that he assumed to be an indispensable feature of normal manhood.'' It is difficult to believe that Montaigne's friend was worried about unwavering rational command. The perennial problem of the penis is precisely that because it is not under a man's rational control, it is taken to reveal his manly desire. That's why a limp penis has often been taken to provide independent evidence against official protestations of masculine desire. Still: ''The solution was to redraw the portrait; it was by accepting a loss of command over the penis as a harmless possibility in lovemaking that one could pre-empt its occurrence -- as the stricken man eventually discovered.'' Good advice at any time, no doubt; excellent advice in a 16th-century French village. But, let's face it, this isn't philosophy. What a relief.</p>
