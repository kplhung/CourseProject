        <p>BANKERS are wringing their hands; tour operators are applauding.</p>
        <p>European countries are enjoying a decade-long boom in American tourism, and the continued weakness of the new European currency, the euro, is expected to attract even more Americans.</p>
        <p>''It's not as though the moment there's a strong dollar people start packing their suitcases,'' said Giuliano Corsi, general manager of the elegant Hotel Danieli in Venice. ''But the strong dollar will certainly tempt people to come to Europe.''</p>
        <p>At the luxurious Hotel Vier Jahreszeiten in Munich, capacity is already 80 to 85 percent, some of which is due to American visitors, and Gerhard Bosse, the front office manager, said, ''People are shopping and buying more, whether its simple souvenirs or expensive items, even china.''</p>
        <p>Of course, not everyone is so bullish.</p>
        <p>''I'm not sure whether a tourist from Burbank is going to come here just because the dollar is a little stronger,'' said an official at Euro Disney, which runs Disneyland Paris. Yet Disney reported that park revenue had risen considerably in the first three months of this year, though it did not say how much of that was from Americans.</p>
        <p>Sixteen months ago, when the euro was introduced, the European travel industry feared the new currency might be so strong it would frighten visitors away. The opposite has happened.</p>
        <p>In January 1999, 11 countries -- Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Austria, Ireland, Finland and Portugal -- adopted the euro. Since then, any transaction not involving cash may be done in euros. Thus, banks offer euro accounts and credit cards, and travel agencies like Thomas Cook and American Express euro-denominated traveler's checks; European stores, like the Galeries Lafayette in Paris, advertise prominently that they will accept them.</p>
        <p>But even if you pay for your Italian fashions or French meals in francs or lire, you are still using euros, since the national currencies, like French francs and Italian lire, are now mere denominations of the euro. At the end of next year, national bills and coins will disappear entirely. Government mints and private contractors across Europe are busy printing 13 billion euro banknotes and minting 56 billion coins.</p>
        <p>Since its introduction, the euro has lost value continuously against other currencies. In fact, the euro has plummeted so far that while an American buying euros a year ago got 0.85 of a euro for every dollar, by May 5, he was getting 1.12. In local currencies, that meant 7.3 French francs, instead of 5.5; 2.19 German marks instead of 1.65, and 2,172 Italian lire rather than 1,645.</p>
        <p>Walter Leu, director of the Brussels-based European Travel Commission, says his organization expects 12 million American tourists this year, compared with 11.6 million last year, continuing a string of annual increases that began in 1993. The increases are due partly, he says, not only to the ''astonishing fact that a cup of coffee costs 50 percent less than only a few years ago,'' but also to America's booming economy. In the last decade, he said, the pool of American travelers that European tourism relies on most -- those with average annual earnings exceeding $75,000 a year -- has doubled, to 30 million.</p>
        <p>Peter Shackleford, regional director for Europe at the World Tourism Organization in Madrid, recalls how before the euro was introduced, European tour operators and hotel owners feared that a powerful euro would deflect tourists to cheaper destinations, like Turkey and Morocco. The present mix of weak euro, low European inflation and a strong American economy, he said, ''is a tour operator's dream.''</p>
        <p>Now, airlines and cruise ship operators are cashing in. The number of nonstop flights from American cities to Europe is growing. In March, Air France began flying from Philadelphia to Paris; this month, Northwest Airlines added flights from Detroit to Rome and Milan.</p>
        <p>This year, Crystal Cruises of Los Angeles added several more destinations, bringing its European cruises to 17, and lengthened the season to mid-November, from late September; Holland America increased its ships to three, from one. Cruise Lines International Association, an industry group, says 1.2 million people will cruise in Europe this year, double the number five years ago.</p>
        <p>Gavin Tollman, president and chief executive of Trafalgar Tours in New York, said the powerful American economy and strong dollar painted ''a jewel picture.'' Trafalgar travelers to Europe will rise 30 percent this year over 1999, he said.</p>
        <p>To be sure, not everyone in Europe is exulting. In Britain, which decided against adopting the euro, the pound has gained in value, making Britain more expensive for travelers from the Continent. This month, the British Tourist Authority revised tourism growth estimates down, from 5 percent to 3 percent. Britain risks losing visitors to France and Italy, it warned, where prices, measured in dollars, are as much as 20 percent lower than a year ago.</p>
