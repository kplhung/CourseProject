Those were the opening words of The Associated Press's Pulitzer-Prize winning report documenting the massacre in 1950 of hundreds of South Korean civilians by American troops at No Gun Ri.

        <p>''It was a story no one wanted to hear.'' Those were the opening words of The Associated Press's Pulitzer-Prize winning report documenting the massacre in 1950 of hundreds of South Korean civilians by American troops at No Gun Ri. When they were crafted by an editor during one of the numerous rewrites, the report's authors found them an apt description of A.P. executives' initial response to their findings.</p>
        <p>Now, attacks on the credibility of three witnesses have given the words an even more ironic cast. U.S. News &amp; World Report and the Web site Stripes.com are citing documents that undermine the credibility of three of a dozen soldiers cited by the A.P. report. All the soldiers' accounts dovetailed with those of two dozen Korean survivors cited by The A.P.</p>
        <p>From the moment in April 1998 when the news agency's special projects unit decided to check Korean civilians' claims of a massacre, to the recent publication of debunking reports by the Internet site and by U.S. News &amp; World Report, the No Gun Ri reporting has been something of a battlefield in its own right.</p>
        <p>In March 1999, six months before the report's publication, top news service executives moved to shelve it, according to a reporter and an editor who worked on the project.</p>
        <p>''I knew we were going to win, because we had such a powerful story, powerfully reported, and we were not going to let it be killed. Period,'' said the reporter, Charles J. Hanley, who has spent most of his career at The Associated Press, once serving as deputy managing editor.</p>
        <p>Robert Port, initial editor on the project until he left the news service last June, said: ''I'm surprised it took this long for the attacks to begin. We expected it. I was certainly ready for it. The reporters were ready. I am not sure the leadership of The A.P. will ever be ready. They are too restrained in defending their own work, out of a sense of remaining objective and neutral.''</p>
        <p>Asked if the No Gun Ri account will stand up under scrutiny, Jon Wolman, the executive editor of the news service, said: ''It's been a complicated and important project, and we've always felt it deserves full scrutiny. We're confident that the reporting is sound and that the central information will be borne out by the investigations by governments in both the United States and Korea.''</p>
        <p>The internal struggle over the account, as members of the reporting and editing team describe it, reflected in part a clash of cultures in a large and journalistically conservative organization that sets fairness and balance as its core values.</p>
        <p>But it also reflected the difficulty of adapting such values to the messy and contradictory business of reconstructing 50-year-old events.</p>
        <p>Finally, the internal struggle played out during the year of the Lewinsky scandal, a year in which a series of embarassing journalistic missteps had put the whole profession on the defensive.</p>
        <p>One of the most publicized missteps also involved witnesses' accounts of an apparent military atrocity: The ''Tailwind'' report, investigated and retracted by CNN, alleged that American troops in Vietnam had used nerve gas in a mission to kill defectors. In fact, in the aftermath of Tailwind, the No Gun Ri team sent a memo to their superiors explaining how their evidence differed from the material supporting the Tailwind report, according to two team members.</p>
        <p>The reporters on the No Gun Ri story were Mr. Hanley, Martha Mendoza and Sang-Hun Choe; the editors directing the project were first Mr. Port, who left to join APBNews.com, then Kevin Noblet, who left to spend a year teaching at an Ohio college, and finally Nick Tatro. ''This was a difficult and frustrating process,'' said Ms. Mendoza, who now works in the A.P.'s San Jose bureau.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Port and Mr. Hanley, the most consistent objections were raised by the former executive editor of The A.P., William Ahearn. Mr. Hanley said that at a meeting in the fall of 1998, Mr. Ahearn was skeptical about the importance of the incident. Mr. Ahearn could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>Six months later, on March 2, 1999, according to Mr. Port and Mr. Hanley, Mr. Ahearn told the team that he did not believe that the account, by then redrafted several times, should be published. Mr. Port said he had appealed to Louis D. Boccardi, the president and chief executive of The A.P., who suggested that if further changes would damage the report, Mr. Port should consider abandoning it. Mr. Boccardi also could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>Next, Mr. Port talked to Mr. Wolman, then the managing editor. As Mr. Wolman recalled, ''I know I told him it was an important story and I was sure we'd make it to the wire.''</p>
        <p>It took six more months for the report to appear in its final form.</p>
        <p>During the early months of the project, Mr. Hanley said, ''We were revising and refining, looking for some magic approach that would break this chill on the story without any direction from above.''</p>
        <p>For Mr. Wolman, any editing process can be contentious. ''We needed to satisfy our standards for accuracy, context, fairness and thoroughness, and we wanted to provide a multimedia account as well as a newspaper story,'' he said. ''It can be a bumpy process, and it was, but the story will stand up.''</p>
