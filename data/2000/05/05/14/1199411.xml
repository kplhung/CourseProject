        <p>Presidential candidates talk about paying down the country's debt, but only Douglas Durst can actually make it disappear.</p>
        <p>The National Debt Clock, which has been reckoning the nation's outstanding loans -- and each family's share -- since 1989, will be covered up this fall in light of an improving debt picture. The clock was the brainchild of Seymour Durst, the real estate magnate and Douglas's father, who put up the dollar-bill-green display at 42nd Street and the Avenue of the Americas as a reminder of the growing trillions the government owed.</p>
        <p>''It's served its purpose,'' said Douglas Durst, president of the Durst Organization since his father's death in 1995. ''The debt now is definitely coming down.'' The clock is to be veiled in a ceremony on Sept. 7, Seymour Durst's birthday. The plan was reported this month in Our Town, a weekly paper on the East Side.</p>
        <p>Seymour Durst built the Durst Organization, founded by his father, into a leading commercial real estate firm. He was also very public about his political beliefs, including a concern about the national debt, which he expressed with passionate letters and advertisements.</p>
        <p>''The first thing he tried was he sent out a New Year's card in 1980 saying, 'Happy New Year, your share of the national debt is $35,000,' or something like that, to all the legislators and all the Congressmen,'' his son said. ''That didn't have the reaction he wanted.''</p>
        <p>Tama Starr, president of Artkraft Strauss, the billboard company that designed and runs the computerized gadfly, said Seymour Durst had first approached her father with the idea in 1981. But because the debt was rising at such a fast rate -- $13,000 a second -- ''he didn't build the clock until the computers came around that could handle that kind of speed'' on an illuminated billboard, she said. ''His idea preceded the technology.''</p>
        <p>The tally is updated weekly from an automated recording at the federal Treasury, Ms. Starr said.</p>
        <p>Bill Bock, a spokesman for the Treasury Department, said that the 60 percent of the national debt that is held by the public through Treasury bonds and the like peaked in 1997. ''We've been paying it down for the last two plus years,'' he said. The total debt, which the clock tracks, also includes money the government borrows from itself to pay for Social Security. It will continue to grow.</p>
        <p>One passing New Yorker wondered why the clock was being retired now, just when the debt picture was finally getting rosy: ''So we only need to be aware of it when it's going up? Oh. O.K.''</p>
