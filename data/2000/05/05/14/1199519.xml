        <p>After so many years of watching him miniaturized on TV and, occasionally, life-sized at courtside, I prepared to flinch as he thundered toward me Kong-sized on the huge Imax screen in the opening scene of ''Michael Jordan to the Max.'' But then, curiously, just before contact, the camera changed its point of view, circling Michael, then rising above him. Interesting, flashy, but ultimately disappointing. Once again, we didn't get close.</p>
        <p>Even for those gasping for just another whiff of Airness, this documercial seems earthbound, slick and bland. Maybe Michael was, after all, just about a few expensive thrills, now fading in rerun without the drama of winning and losing. The film seems particularly empty compared with the recent PBS documentary on Joe DiMaggio, which was brilliant and dark, and the latest flurry of reinterpretations of Muhammad Ali.</p>

        <p>After so many years of watching him miniaturized on TV and, occasionally, life-sized at courtside, I prepared to flinch as he thundered toward me Kong-sized on the huge Imax screen in the opening scene of ''Michael Jordan to the Max.'' But then, curiously, just before contact, the camera changed its point of view, circling Michael, then rising above him. Interesting, flashy, but ultimately disappointing. Once again, we didn't get close.</p>
        <p>Even for those gasping for just another whiff of Airness, this documercial seems earthbound, slick and bland. Maybe Michael was, after all, just about a few expensive thrills, now fading in rerun without the drama of winning and losing. The film seems particularly empty compared with the recent PBS documentary on Joe DiMaggio, which was brilliant and dark, and the latest flurry of reinterpretations of Muhammad Ali.</p>
        <p>We still know nothing about Michael. Which, of course, may be enough. Posed on a stool in the middle of an empty basketball court, he talks glibly about the pain of being cut from his high school team; it was the trauma that drove him. He offers sound advice; make sure kids learn to love the game first, and, always, try. He says he is grateful that he had his dad, who was murdered, for 32 years, because so many grow up with no dads at all.</p>
        <p>That's about it for up close and personal. The highlight reel has the winning shots and the best commercials with Spike Lee. The music is heroic movie sound, very little N.B.A. anthem hip-hop here. Commissioner David Stern utters the benediction: ''Globalization.''</p>
        <p>And the last words we hear, from Michael, are fit for a hero-prophet: ''There will be a player greater than me.''</p>
        <p>So what do you expect for $9.50? Even the steak sauce at the memorabilia shop at his pricey Grand Central Terminal restaurant is $6 a bottle.</p>
        <p>Early in the 45-minute film, Bob Greene, the Chicago columnist and Jordanologist, cites one reason for Michael's competitive ferocity -- he doesn't want to disappoint that one person in the audience who might never have seen him before. This is a vanity often attributed to Joe DiMaggio, another fierce competitor who never seemed to stand for much more than performance and cash flow.</p>
        <p>Written and narrated by the DiMaggio biographer Richard Ben Cramer, with telling insights by the sportswriter Maury Allen, this 90-minute chapter in the ''American Experience'' series is a cold look at the hollowness of ''The Hero's Life.'' A former Yankee teammate, Jerry Coleman, without apparent affection, calls DiMaggio ''a giant'' in the game, but admits he isn't sure why. A friend of Marilyn Monroe's, Brad Dexter (my favorite gunslinger in my favorite western, ''The Magnificent Seven''), describes DiMaggio as justifiably tortured with guilt because he, as much as anyone else, contributed to her deadly overdose.</p>
        <p>Mean, petty, spiteful, insecure, Joltin' Joe may also have been a wife-beater. He had little to do with his only child, Joe Jr., who had his own problems.</p>
        <p>Toward the end of his life, according to the documentary, DiMaggio earned $250,000 for two days at card shows. It isn't steak sauce, but it adds up.</p>
        <p>Some icons are reinterpreted every generation. Ali seems to get a fresh look every five years or so. In two recently published books, he is portrayed as an overhyped clown and as the most important sports figure of last century.</p>
        <p>In Nick Tosches's ''The Devil and Sonny Liston'' (Little, Brown), Cassius Clay/Muhammad Ali is described as ''tiresome drably colorful'' and ''the darling of a white intelligentsia who sought meaning and metaphor in boxing.'' Liston, ''the most unconquerable of heavyweight boxers enslaved by the forces of darkness,'' tanked both fights against Ali for the mob, Tosches writes, although Ali never knew because ''the main burden of making the fix look real'' is carried by ''the preordained winner.''</p>
        <p>In ''Muhammad Ali's Greatest Fight: Cassius Clay vs. The United States of America,'' (M. Evans), Ali's best friend, the photographer Howard Bingham, and Max Wallace advance the case that Ali's refusal to be drafted during the Vietnam War was a pivotal moment in American history. It stiffened the resolve of other protesters and was a catalyst for further change.</p>
        <p>The background music to this boomlet is being written by John Duffy, composer of the opera ''Muhammad Ali,'' scenes from which were showcased last week by the New York City Opera. Not to be too coy, I am writing the libretto.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the Muhammad Ali Center in Louisville will begin a national campaign next month to raise $60 million for its riverfront site and its school outreach programs on tolerance and conflict resolution. The state of Kentucky has already budgeted $10 million, and there is $10 million from private donors, according to Barry Alberts, the project manager.</p>
        <p>Maybe there could be a few bucks in there for Jim Thorpe. In her latest public-relations sortie, his daughter, the indomitable Grace Thorpe, has recruited Anna McKibben, the 10th National Miss Indian U.S.A. (Quapaw tribe of Oklahoma), to campaign for Thorpe's picture on a Wheaties box. Jim mesmerized the globe at the Stockholm Olympics in 1912, long before globalization.</p>
        <p>A dark documentary, a perennial re-evaluation, cereal fame, none of these may be in Michael's future. He and his agents seem to have shut the lid on his image box. History will get the highlight reel, which may be all there is anyway.</p>
