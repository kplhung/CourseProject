        <p>THE choreographer and performance artist Ann Carlson has a knack for astonishing audiences with simplicity. Downtown dance mavens still oh and ah when recalling ''Visit Woman Move Story Cat Cat Cat'' (1987), in which the voluptuous 5-foot-tall performer danced naked while clutching a tiny kitten, vividly recreating the image of Koko, the 300-pound female gorilla who learned to communicate through sign language, and her pet kitten, All Ball.</p>
        <p>It was one of a series of dance works Ms. Carlson made in which animals became her partners. And then there was the time in 1992 when she transformed the forbidding black-box theater at Dance Theater Workshop into a gleaming white cube for an evening of dances called ''Etihw,'' white spelled backward, that dealt with purity, blindness and the afterlife.</p>
        <p>Ms. Carlson, 45, has repeatedly based dances on ''what if'' scenarios -- often incorporating nontraditional performers -- while exploring issues of community, femininity and mortality. In the process, she often breaks down the barrier between performer and spectator while redefining what constitutes performance. Ms. Carlson is a conceptual artist who uses gesture, text and humor to break your heart. As Jennifer Dunning wrote in The New York Times in 1998, ''Ms. Carlson has an extraordinary gift for connecting the real and the imaginary in ways that leave their mystery vibrantly intact.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Carlson's new work will stretch the boundaries of dance performance once again. ''Night Light,'' presented by Dancing in the Streets in association with the Kitchen for eight performances beginning on Wednesday, is a nighttime walking tour through the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan. Eight guides -- people who live or work in Chelsea -- will lead groups of 15 to several locations where they will happen upon tableaux vivants in which historic photographs taken at those sites will be reconstructed by dancers. The dancers don't move, the audience does, but then again, ideas about stillness have long been a part of Ms. Carlson's choreographic vocabulary. For reservations and location, call the Kitchen at (212) 255-5793, Extension 11.</p>
        <p>There will be seven tableaus in all, although no single tour will visit every site. Included are images of three women in towels at a Turkish bath, based on a photograph from 1904, priests leaving General Theological Seminary carrying suitcases (a recruitment advertisement from 1955), a murder victim and an 1895 Alice Austen photo of a young woman selling newspapers on the corner of Sixth Avenue and 23rd Street in Manhattan. Ms. Austen, an amateur photographer who took about 8,000 images, is considered a precursor of documentary photography. Ms. Carlson, with the help of two photo researchers and the Museum of the City of New York, scavenged through thousands of images before settling on these.</p>
        <p>''There are so many issues in each photo,'' Ms. Carlson said. ''I don't have a photographic background and it's been interesting to learn about what photos are staged or not staged -- in one sense, they are all staged -- and what the archives hold. You fall into this abyss of whose history we are talking about when you look at the archives. What gets kept? What gets remembered? It's very difficult, for instance, to find historic images of people of color. The photos also reveal issues of class. My concern is how do you talk about that and not be didactic?''</p>
        <p>On one level, ''Night Light'' is a timely examination of gentrification and displacement, of how one industrial section of New York -- not accessible by public transportation -- has become one of the centers of the contemporary art world. Dozens of galleries have transformed garages into sleek exhibition spaces. And it's not uncommon to bump into tour groups wandering through the galleries on weekends. At the same time, Ms. Carlson is winking at herself as part of this privileged, hipster world. Her portrait, taken with the videographer Mary Ellen Strom, her partner of the last 10 years, was included in the recent Catherine Opie show at Gorney Bravin Lee on West 26th Street.</p>
        <p>The idea of ordinary people and their extraordinary stories has been a recurrent element in Ms. Carlson's work. She burst onto the New York performance scene in 1986 with ''Sloss, Kerr, Rosenberg and Moore,'' a nine-minute dance for four real-life attorneys. The performers were confined to a rectangular area taped on the floor and never looked at one another. Through their wild gesticulations, Ms. Carlson hilariously captured the competitive and insecure world of corporate life. Other pieces using nuns, security guards and basketball players have followed.</p>
        <p>MS. CARLSON, who grew up in Park Ridge, Ill., graduated magna cum laude from the University of Utah with a bachelor's degree in dance. She earned a graduate degree at the University of Arizona before moving to New York in 1984. Specifically, she came hoping to work with Meredith Monk, a multidisciplinary artist she had read about but had never met or seen perform. She auditioned and did not get into the troupe at first, but in 1986 she did join Ms. Monk, who subsequently insisted that Ms. Carlson leave to pursue her own muse. Today, Ms. Carlson lives in Stuyvesant Town with Ms. Strom and their three adopted children, 7-year-old twin boys and a daughter, 6.</p>
        <p>Over the next two years, ''Night Light'' will be recreated in Boston, Chicago, Portland, Ore., and Riverside, Calif. In each city, the presenter will pick the neighborhood for the tours, and Ms. Carlson will then do the photographic research. Meanwhile, she is presenting a new solo at the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C., on June 11 and 12, a companion piece to ''Grass/ Bird/Rodeo,'' a triptych of solos she performed in February at P. S. 122. In that piece, Ms. Carlson tries to demystify the choreographic process by telling stories about the work and taking questions from the audience before each section.</p>
        <p>'' 'Night Light' is looking into a moment that is gone,'' Ms. Carlson said. ''I loved the idea of seeing these two-dimensional photos brought back into three dimensions. I'm recreating these images in a gray scale -- these ghostly images in a full-toned world.''</p>
