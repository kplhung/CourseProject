        <p>THE very idea of ''Man of La Mancha'' revisited is more  of a tip for the incidental tourist than a mandate for the musical theater aficionado.</p>
        <p>Few musicals have been as relentlessly revived in community theaters and dinner theaters. It's even a groaner to high school drama coaches.</p>
        <p>But the return of ''Man of La Mancha'' to Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam in what is being widely trumpeted as a 35th anniversary production is an occasion beyond musical theater annals. For here is where the musical, which became a worldwide phenomenon, was first performed. Has any show been recorded by ''original casts'' in so many languages? Or to put it coarsely, here is the birth place of a cash cow.</p>
        <p>How a once rare musical adventure sank to commonplace stock stuff is another story. Who remembers the advertisements: ''What? You've only seen 'Man of La Mancha' once?'' as the show was ascending to its 1,000th, then 2,000th performance on Broadway? And then to at least three Broadway revivals in about a decade? No wonder that question about seeing it just once soon elicited the answer: Please, not again.</p>
        <p>But mega-success did not even begin as moderate acceptance. As soon as an inventive musical -- upbeat in theme, dour and, in its own words, woeful in countenance -- arrived in New York, at the since demolished ANTA Washington Square Theater, it appeared destined to go down as a flop. Connecticut raved, but New York didn't care. Critics were indifferent, audiences did not come. Only an impassioned cult spread the word. But then there was that song!</p>
        <p>Ask any composer or star of a failed musical based on a classic to explain why their show bombed in New York, and it's likely they won't blame the critics; the answer is apt to be a variation of the same whine: ''We didn't have our 'Impossible Dream,' '' or as it is really called, ''The Quest.''</p>
        <p>Of course, the score by Mitch Leigh (music) and Joe Darion (lyrics) is no one-song affair. But that one song, it is commonly perceived, did it, and keeps doing it.</p>
        <p>The inspirational message, ''follow the quest,'' is synonymous with a  never-say-die musical.</p>
        <p>If only the new Goodspeed production, which also marks the farewell to theater by Gerald Gutierrez, who staged the indelible Broadway revivals of ''The Heiress'' and ''A Delicate Balance,'' in addition to three musicals in East Haddam, rose to one occasion or another.</p>
        <p>Besides welcomely restoring the piece to one act, as it was conceived and is hardly ever played, most theater managers believing that what audiences need most is an intermission, the production of Mr. Gutierrez is less a renewal than a retread, and a very weary one at that.</p>
        <p>Theatrical masterstrokes -- the imprisoned Cervantes putting on his makeup, the artifice essential to inhabit Don Quixote -- are minimized, if not missing.</p>
        <p>An inspired play within a play deteriorates into a charade, a mock trial into a mockery. What remains of original concept is done in by central casting.</p>
        <p>Shawn Elliot in the dual role of an artist, incarcerated for idealism, sallying forth, in the guise of his noble creation, to ''right all wrongs'' and to ''add a measure of grace to the world'' emerges neither as a singing-actor nor as an actor-singer. His rendition of the rapturous ''Dulcinea,'' always the musical's defining song to this listener, is feeble. Even the show's signature song fails to rouse. The key performance is not heroic.</p>
        <p>Nancy Ticotin is a Dulcinea wannabe, but a self-loathing Aldonza, never. No down and dirty strumpet born in a ditch, Ms. Ticotin looks more scrubbed than drubbed, appealingly ready and more than able to audition for the new flamenco company in town. Indeed, the director's workable concept, to accentuate the musical's intrinsic, previously ignored reflection of a diverse Hispanic culture, is obeyed if not fulfilled by Ramon Oller's new flamenco dances, and disserved by stilted slow-motion effects. Ms. Ticotin, who has performed with Ballet Hispanico of New York, is stepping out authentically, without standing out dramatically or vocally, though her reprise of ''Dulcinea'' at the Don's deathbed is no letdown.</p>
        <p>Happily, Sancho (Stephen Mo Hanan) is not being overdone as a lamentable Jewish vaudeville stereotype. The actor's case of the cutes may not be terminal, but it needs to be treated, and forever dopey songs like ''I Really Like Him'' and ''A Little Gossip'' are forever damaging to the cause of changing Sancho into a bearable character.</p>
        <p>But as long as impossible dreams are dreamed, it may not matter who the master dreamer is. Once it did.</p>
        <p>''Man of La Mancha'' at Goodspeed Opera House, East Haddam, (860) 873-8668. Performances run through July 10.</p>
