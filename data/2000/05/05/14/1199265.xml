        <p>Horst  Nassau County Museum of Art, 1 Museum Drive, Roslyn Harbor. Through May 29. (516) 484-9337.</p>
        <p>The late Horst P. Horst, an Oyster Bay resident for more than 50 years, acquired international renown for the way his inventive photographs furthered fame. Subtitled ''A World of Celebrities,'' this large overview is a reminder of the power his work had in marketing personas.</p>
        <p>Paulette Goddard looks seductive as she peers through gloved fingers. Exaggerated illumination makes Noel Coward's face seem to sparkle with wit, and Salvador Dali appears to be in a seance with some other world. Striking portraits of Bianca Jagger, Edith Sitwell, Coco Chanel and Marlene Dietrich are other memorable examples.</p>
        <p>Wisely, the exhibition also includes selections of Horst images, many now considered classics, that fall into other categories: still lifes, nudes and fashion. For many years, it was the Horst photographs in magazines that made elegance something tangible and shaped attitudes about this ephemeral quality.</p>
        <p>Constantly manipulating lighting, Horst had a way of making subjects majestic, often turning them into icons by making them seem sculptural. There is ample evidence here of how he achieved this by clarifying gray tones to give them impact and emphasize volume and solidity.</p>
        <p>Effective compositions of shapes and tones are basic to the Horst impact. The aloof detachment of his subjects seems to keep them from any audience engagement that might distract from the artistry that weaves all components into a single strong scheme.</p>
        <p>An early interest in architecture and the prevalence of Surrealism as the avant-garde art of his formative years contributed to the imaginative way Horst constructed each setting. His careful creation of an artificial world, sometimes with abstract shapes and pseudo furnishings and structures, was a forerunner of the staged photography that emerged significantly in the 1990's.</p>
        <p>Examining Horst's use of torso, head and limb gestures provides insights, too. They are contrived, but always justified in the context of the overall design he sought.</p>
        <p>Kathleen Turner pushing her hair back manages to place a diagonal at just the right location, and Ginger Rogers's right arm on a stage-prop lampost provides a perfect central linear motif.</p>
        <p>Waxworks</p>
        <p>Graphic Eye Gallery, 301 Main Street, Port Washington. Through May 21. (516) 883-9668.</p>
        <p>Encaustic painting, based on a wax technique, offers an appealing viscosity and pliability. The Metropolitan Museum's recent exhibition of ancient Egyptian mummy portraits painted in encaustic is a reminder of the medium's heritage.</p>
        <p>Works produced by contemporary artists often tend to emphasize wax's inherent potential for expressive texture and a certain amount of translucence and light diffusion. Some of these characteristics are explored in recent paintings by Gloria Cunnick and Angela Milner, artists who have exhibited extensively on Long Island for more than a decade.</p>
        <p>In general, examples chosen for this show seem to compress experiences into abstractions that are occasionally sparked with recognizable images.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most intriguing use of light diffusion occurs in Ms. Milner's ''Alaskan Atoll,'' an elongated collage that adds irregular chunks of clear plastic to suggest ice crystals imbedded in an illusory body of water and undulating string to define a hilly terrain emerging from the seemingly fluid, semitransparent colored wax.</p>
        <p>Texture has a principal expressive role in a series that Ms. Cunnick based on a trip to Italy. Tactile qualities of old walls, buildings and the landscape are frequently sensed in these carefully plotted compositions.</p>
        <p>''Paese,'' a good example of the artist's ability to blend geometric order with undisciplined organic shapes, is particularly effective, because of the way it uses its textured green-pigmented wax to suggest both worldly and abstract images.</p>
        <p>There are other notable pieces in this somewhat uneven show. Ms. Milner's ''Knowledge Totem'' is a blend of tough, built-out grid motifs and abstract facets densely pigmented with fleshy and blood-red tones that lend a mysterious human aura. Ms. Cunnick's ''Rocca'' and ''Aspetta'' concentrate on muted but vibrating tones and spatial divisions that entice shifting optical sensations.</p>
        <p>Mexican Folk Art  Morgan Rank Gallery, 4 Newtown Lane, East Hampton. Through June 4. (631) 324-7615.</p>
        <p>Throughout history it has been customary for artists to accept requests to create work associated with spiritual beliefs. In Mexico, the tradition of producing devotional paintings is particularly strong.</p>
        <p>This sizable and fascinating exhibition, ''Life Is a Dream: South of the Border Folk Art,'' concentrates on small images painted by anonymous artists during the first half of the 20th century. They are executed on tin, like many of the retablos that inspired them, but were made as acknowledgments of a personal problem solved or a prayer answered.</p>
        <p>Intervention by a holy figure is implied, and many examples include a depiction of the Virgin or a patron saint, as well as a citation in the neatly lettered text along the lower edge. The gallery provides translations in adjacent labels.</p>
        <p>The material hovers somewhere between genre and the visionary. Health restored or a rescue from accidental death are recurring themes, but there is much to be gleaned about local society in subjects referring to crime, domestic situations and everyday trials and tribulations, like property disputes and farm and business incidents. The content is real, and the genuine sincerity of the work is affecting.</p>
        <p>A flat, simplified rendering of figures is fairly consistent, and reinforces the sense of stylization in these similarly scaled pieces. It is often the characteristics of the painted lettering that make one artist stand apart from another. A degree of rigidity is present, but it is engaging to note suggestions of the psychological pressures implicit in some depictions.</p>
        <p>Interior and exterior settings surrounding the simplified figures tend to use standard conventions for perspective. Views of household rooms, with their detailed furnishings, are especially absorbing.</p>
