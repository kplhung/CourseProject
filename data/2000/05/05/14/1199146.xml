        <p>Anil's Ghost</p>
        <p>By Michael Ondaatje.</p>
        <p>307 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Alfred A. Knopf. $25.</p>
        <p>Michael Ondaatje's novels swing on fiction's rope -- they launch into a flight of myth, and are caught up once more in agile narrative hands. Like trapeze artists, they fly from one arm-straining gravity to another, across a shocking gap of weightlessness.</p>
        <p>His heroes are adepts of reality and backlit in legend. They are, all of them, workers. ''Work for the night is coming'' goes an old hymn. For Ondaatje, work fights the night. Craft in the widest sense (art, perhaps, or labor's skills or a scientist's devotion) is illumination in the darkness of a world blood-drenched and fed on abstractions.</p>
        <p>Ondaatje's craftsmen rise to the miraculous. There are the sapper in ''The English Patient,'' the high-steel rigger in the less-known ''In the Skin of a Lion'' and, in ''Anil's Ghost,'' two Sri Lankan brothers: Sarath, an archaeologist, and Gamini, a doctor. In opposite ways, and going from fraternal estrangement to tragic reconciliation, they labor through their country's miasmic three-way horror: two distinct insurrections -- separatist and leftist -- and the government's repression. The estimated 20-year toll is 17,000 dead.</p>
        <p>''Anil's Ghost'' is more tightly focused than ''The English Patient,'' and not as wide-ranging. It has one or two dead spots. Ultimately, though, it overwhelms in much the same way. We experience a catastrophe -- World War II in ''The English Patient,'' the Sri Lankan terror here -- in a fashion made more intense precisely because of the entrancing or disconcerting odd ambles that turn us so we don't see the slam approaching the back of the head. Ondaatje's moral urgency comes less as statement than as asides; not as a directed beam but as a series of cross-reflections and refractions.</p>
        <p>Recall Sapper hoisting the nurse by a pulley in Arezzo's Church of San Francesco so she can see the Piero frescoes up close. It seems a bit of gorgeous literary plumage until we realize that it is also an affirmation of what can fly above war's destruction. Take one of many such doubling moments in ''Anil's Ghost'':</p>
        <p>Sarath relates a village abduction. Two armed men on bicycles grab a villager, barefoot and clad in a sarong. They mount him on a bicycle crossbar and pedal off. To hang on, the victim must loop an arm around his captor's neck. ''It was this necessary intimacy that was disturbing,'' Sarath recalls. ''The blindfolded man had to balance his body in tune with his possible killer. They cycled off and at the far end of the street, beyond the market buildings, they turned and disappeared.''</p>
        <p>An abducted man who leans cooperatively into the curves. What an image for the mutual closeness that distinguishes the contemporary hells: neighbors slaughtering neighbors in Bosnia, Kosovo, Rwanda, Sri Lanka. ''Anil's Ghost'' may be the fiction that comes closest to wresting this horror from reportage and analysis into a more expansive human context. Only art can provide it: a context of images seen and half-seen, of subconscious emotions, of memory and foreboding, the mind shutting down and (the soul in clinical shock) the bicycle swaying between ''this can't be happening'' and ''this is what is happening.''</p>
        <p>Sarath recalls the incident for Anil. She is a young Sri Lankan who went abroad to study medicine, specialized in forensic pathology and has come back on a United Nations human rights mission to examine some of the victims of the terror. The government agreed reluctantly to the mission and keeps a grim eye on it. Sarath, whose specialty is sixth-century archaeology (things, not people), has been officially -- and thus perhaps suspectly -- designated to accompany her.</p>
        <p>Anil is the story's active agent, its protagonist even, but in the way that Gulliver is the protagonist of his travels. He was Swift's instrument and touchstone for depicting the satiric worlds that were his real subject. Anil is more active and her fervor for truth precipitates events, but her role is a reagent's: to venture in peril along with the two brothers, who denote their country's tragedy, and with two others -- a monk-scientist and an artist who paints eyes on the Buddhas that tower over the island's landscape. They denote spaces beyond tragedy.</p>
        <p>The form of ''Anil's Ghost'' is that of a river with tributaries feeding into it. Anil's adventures with Sarath are the main channel. Investigating an archaeological site, they find a burned skeleton among the remains. The evidence points to violent death and to the body's having been moved from somewhere else. Since the site is closed and guarded by the army, this would be the first specific evidence of the government's long-rumored black operations.</p>
        <p>How can they identify the dead man? They visit Sarath's old mentor, Paripana, a once-eminent archaeologist retired to an abandoned monastery and close to death. He knows of someone who might construct from the skull a representation of the face. Ananda is last in a line of craftsmen appointed to paint eyes on statues of the Buddha. Only when the eyes were in place did the statues possess a living holiness. To avoid a direct glance from the divinity they had just implanted, the artists worked with their backs turned, using a mirror.</p>
        <p>Ananda fashions a face that would be recognizable and usable for identification -- except that it wears the generic Buddha's expression of serenity. Ananda's wife disappeared in the terror; the painter cannot bear to configure death as anything but a state of peace.</p>
        <p>The Ananda scenes are one of the novel's enriching tributaries. Another is the visit to Paripana, whose scientific dazzle has receded into meditation: ''For him, now, all history was filled with sunlight.'' Nowhere has Ondaatje written more beautifully than in these two apparent diversions from the main current of atrocity and its pursuit. Or more to his many-headed point.</p>
        <p>The point develops over the course of Anil and Sarath's complicated partnership as they journey through Sri Lanka's mysteries and countryside. Chill wariness alternates with stumbles into understanding, one leading to transfiguration, in an astonishing and inevitable climax.</p>
        <p>Anil comes with Western-bred investigative passion: the certainty that facts are there to be unearthed and that truth is to be constructed out of them. Sarath, a polymorphous spirit and the book's most memorable figure, cautions that the real truth of his country is ambiguous and unobtainable. ''I want you to understand the archaeological surround of a fact,'' he tells her. ''Or you'll be like one of those journalists who file reports about flies and scabs while staying at the Galle Face Hotel. That false empathy and blame.''</p>
        <p>But he takes an increasingly active and perilous part in the quest. If Anil has no doubts about truth, Sarath, like the painter of eyes, believes that to gaze at it can be lethal, and that mirrors must be used for as long as they will serve. But perhaps for no longer.</p>
        <p>That ''perhaps'' holds the story in moral tension almost until the end. His doubts are the opposite -- again, almost to the end -- of Gamini's unquestioning affirmation. Throughout, in compelling force and detail, we witness the brother's punishing nonstop work in the emergency ward of Colombo's main hospital. He has given up everything (his wife has left him) for sleepless vigils treating the unending victims of bombings, shootings and maimings. There is an intensity reminiscent of the gripping scenes of Sapper disarming bombs in ''The English Patient.'' Both are eschatological battles for the life principle against the forces of death.</p>
        <p>The only real weakness in ''Anil's Ghost'' is the depiction of Anil's life -- a failed marriage and love affair, an intimate friendship -- in the West. The scenes are ingenious but seem bestowed; the author only has vital need of her once she is back in Sri Lanka; so, only, does the reader.</p>
        <p>Years ago, Ondaatje, who was born in Sri Lanka, wrote ''Running in the Family,'' an entrancing, part-fictional memoir of his parents' and grandparents' lives in a quieter time. Though much shorter, it has some of the serio-magical quality of Gabriel Garcia Mrquez's ''Love in the Time of Cholera.'' Garcia Mrquez has more recently dealt with Colombia's bloody present, and very well, but with expansive rather than magical realism. It is Ondaatje's extraordinary achievement to use magic in order to make the blood of his own country real.</p>
