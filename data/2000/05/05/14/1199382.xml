        <p>As part of a multimillion dollar redevelopment plan for Port Chester's downtown, the county will assist in the creation of a public promenade along the village's waterfront. Under the plan, G &amp; S Investors of Bethpage on Long Island, the developer of the redevelopment project, would build the public promenade along a half-mile stretch of waterfront. The county would lease the land to help with the financing. The village would be responsible for the promenade's upkeep. ''This plan is in keeping with my commitment to revitalize our cities and urban areas by promoting economic development that will expand our tax base and create jobs,'' County Executive Andrew J. Spano said.</p>
