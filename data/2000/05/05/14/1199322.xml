        <p>DAVID ROCHE is throwing it all away for a slice of pizza.</p>
        <p>''No, I don't have any business plans for the future,'' he said, looking bored.</p>
        <p>He had missed my point. Slightly annoyed, I tried again. ''Do you have a business plan -- have you written down your business ideas?''</p>
        <p>He thought for a moment. ''I do have a business paragraph,'' he said, staring longingly at the tetherball court.</p>
        <p>David is 11.</p>
        <p>In Silicon Valley, the nexus of a great technological and get-rich-quick revolution, where opportunity flows like bottled water at a health club, entrepreneurs are getting younger by the day. A few have become millionaires before reaching 20. Busloads are forgoing fraternity rush and heading directly to exit strategies.</p>
        <p>Growing up here must give local children a terrific head start. Just how young do they catch the entrepreneurial bug? I was off to local elementary schools to find out.</p>
        <p>Astonishingly, plenty of children here are not with the program. They seem entirely unobsessed with starting dot-coms, tracking the Nasdaq or buying new Saabs. Perhaps I could  straighten them out.</p>
        <p>David, a fifth grader at Arundel School, declared that he wanted to be a fighter pilot or paleontologist. He said that writing his ''business paragraph'' -- a few sentences for a class assignment on starting a business -- was not as much fun as tetherball. Or Pizza Day at school.</p>
        <p>''I'd rather go to the dentist,'' he said. ''I have a really nice dentist.''</p>
        <p>I asked his classmates: Do you know who is more important than the president, your parents and Barney combined? Blank stares. ''Venture capitalists,'' I reminded them.</p>
        <p>''Are they people who venture to different capitals,'' asked Nicole Gordon, 11. ''I'd like to go to visit capitals like Washington, D.C.''</p>
        <p>Teacher, doctor, naturalist -- what kind of dreams are those for a new generation of digerati? Have they absorbed no values from grown-ups around them who burn the midnight oil at dot-com jobs to bring home piles of stock options that, before April 14 anyway, could buy huge houses and BMW's? The kids, it seems, want to have fun. Imagine!</p>
        <p>More depressing, they want it even though they have the technology savvy to be the next Bill Gates. Witness: Brian Quiggle, 8, changed all the screen savers in the White Oaks Elementary School computer lab to display logos of Yahoo, where his father works. ''I said two things to him,'' reported Betty Casey, the principal. ''One was 'You can't do that.' The other was 'How do we take them off?' ''</p>
        <p>Sitting with two classmates, Christopher Bertetta and Samantha Robinson, Brian said he was not sure that he was ready to capitalize on his computer skills. He was keen to show me a stick he had whittled to a sharp point. He looked at two passing police motorcycles and said, ''Cool.''</p>
        <p>I figured that this was my chance. I asked the three third graders if they would be willing to quit school and start an Internet company with me.</p>
        <p>I was hopeful at first. They all said that they thought the Internet was neat and that they regularly used e-mail and surfed the Web. Brian explained that the com in dot-com stands for commercial, suggesting he was primed to quit thinking recess and start thinking equity.</p>
        <p>But Christopher, who said he would rather be a rock star or a cartoonist, was skeptical, muttering something about wanting an education. ''If you promise I could be a multibillionaire, I'd learn all that cruddy Internet stuff,'' he said. ''I'd do that or start an amusement park, like Raging Waters and Great America put together.''</p>
        <p>Samantha said she would prefer being a scientist or missionary. She wants to help people. That sounded O.K., I had to admit. Raging Waters might be fun, too. Riding a roller-coaster must be easier on the stomach than watching real-time stock quotations.</p>
        <p>CONFUSED, I sat on a bench and talked to Jenny Pho, 8. Her smile was wider than San Francisco Bay. This girl has charisma, I thought. I'll hire her as my chief executive!</p>
        <p>If I started a company, I asked her, would she be willing to run it? I'd pay her gobs of money. ''Money's not that important,'' she said.</p>
        <p>So what is most important? She thought deeply, displaying a focus that any board of directors would appreciate. ''Friendship,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Hmm. Maybe net worth and workaholism aren't everything, I thought. Maybe she's on to something. No doubt we'll grind it out of her in high school.</p>
