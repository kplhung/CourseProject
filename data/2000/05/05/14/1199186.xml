        <p>Where are all those pesky little Stalinists from PETA when you need them? Instead of tossing paint bombs at million-dollar runway models and skulking around Fifth Avenue waiting for Aretha Franklin to show up in her mink, they should be out in the Hudson River throwing their red goo on the ichthyocidal striped bass. It's hard to make a villain out of any fish now that Great Whites have somehow or other become Man's Best Friend, but that little striper may well have become so plump and tasty by eating -- and now nearly destroying -- the shad population of the Hudson River.</p>
        <p>The American shad has been a rite of spring at least since the days of Jefferson, but today her population is dwindling rapidly. It seems there are too many striped bass for their own good -- and every one of them loves to eat shad, particularly when she's a 3-inch fingerling. (Don't you wish you had dinner guests who all liked the same food?) Christopher Letts, a naturalist from the Hudson River Foundation who is responsible for many of the shad bakes this month, has a friend who recently took a boat out and returned with 100 pounds of shad -- and 700 pounds of striped bass. So why wouldn't an entrepreneurial fisherman sell those stripers either along with or instead of the beloved shad? Because he can't. Some years ago, when the Hudson was one of the most-trashed rivers in the country, New York State determined that stripers were so loaded with PCB's that a single bite could land you in a nursing home well before your time. Although Letts believes this no longer applies, the state still hasn't lifted its warning; hence the 700 pounds of striped bass in Letts's friend's boat can't be sold and must be thrown back.</p>

        <p>Farther south, shad fare no better. In New Jersey, the striper hasn't been declared dangerous; it has been declared a sport fish and hence off-limits for commercial fisherpeople. (Can you think of a clumsier word than ''fisherpeople?'' No? Well, Sir Tim Rice can.) The American shad's season is lengthy -- if you happen to be walking from Georgia to Nova Scotia between the months of January and July. As long as you keep moving, you can eat Alosa sapidissima every step of the way as the fish swims the Atlantic farther and farther north, following the 50-degree waters. (Like salmon and sturgeon, shad is anadromous -- it cavorts in saltwater but spawns and breeds in fresh.) However, if you've got a home at a fixed longitude like most of us, the season is short -- somewhere between four and eight weeks. Not only do you have to hurry to eat her, she's trouble: shad is the boniest fish in the river; she's tricky to cook and, what's more, she's only a big old herring.</p>
        <p>Is shad worth the trouble? Well, in addition to my being a caring, sharing nurturer concerned about every living species on Planet Earth, blah, blah, blah, I think it is absolutely delicious, stuffed with spinach or bread crumbs, gently poached in wine or milk or even grilled simply with a few onions. Cooked, it has the structure of a sandwich: it reveals layers of color, from pinkish beige to dark brown, the flavor matching the color in intensity. The top layer is delicate and slightly mushy, and the deeper your fork rappels, the firmer the texture and the more intense the color and taste. Its roe, tiny orange grains that feel but don't taste like cheap caviar, is unique -- a rich and sort of fishy sweetbread. And if you use fish as a verb, they're a great fight. Just ask John McPhee.</p>
        <p>Shad's knottiest problem, and why she has failed to enter the piscatorial pantheon, is her bones. (Notice when there are bad things to say about shad, the fish turns feminine? This in no way reflects my view of the world.) According to Micmac Indian legend, the shad was originally an unhappy porcupine who asked the Great Spirit Manitou to recreate it in another form. Manitou obliged by turning the porcupine inside out, dubbing it ''shad'' and hurling it into the river. An ichthyologist friend of Letts actually counted them: 769!</p>
        <p>How do you get rid of 769 shad bones? The craft is dying. ''Used to have a great deboner,'' Letts says, ''but he quit to become a fencing instructor.'' Joe Zaientz, a retired dentist who helps run the fingernail-size shad museum in Higganum, Conn., says of deboning a shad: ''Oh, it can be done. But I can't do it.''</p>
        <p>The undisputed champs of getting rid of those bones are the Marino sisters of Dill's Seafood in Bridgeton, N.J. Dill's has been in the Marino family for 48 years, first under the guidance of Everett Marino Sr., now run with a jolly hand by his sons Everett Jr. and Earl. It is about the merriest seafood emporium you could hope for -- 10 to 14 family members (no one seems to know) work the takeout counters, kitchen stoves, dining room tables and fish-cleaning areas, five days a week. And when the shad come in, the performance of the Marino sisters is downright balletic. On a recent visit there, Leona Marino Chinnici told me, ''I can bone a shad in 37 seconds -- 42 if you're watching.'' But don't expect her to put on a display. ''When the girls see anybody watching them bone shad, they put down their knives,'' said Earl. ''No one outside the family has ever seen them bone one. It's a family secret.''</p>
        <p>Maybe it was luck or maybe it was just the pathetic look on my face, but somehow Earl managed to persuade Leona to let me watch. Once. Well, if you ever want to see a vorpal blade go snicker-snack, Leona is your girl. Sister Shirley, sister-in-law Nancy and cousin Phil watched as my jaw slackened. Thwick, thwack, thwick -- in three strokes Leona slipped sheets of fish flesh onto the cutting table. The side of fish was boneless before I'd even had a chance to see what she was doing, making a single opening down its middle with two large flaps of meat to surround the spinach stuffing the restaurant would later provide. ''Most slicing techniques leave only 32 percent of the meat,'' said Everett Jr. ''Ours, you get 44 percent.'' At dinner that night, the shad was completely unossiferous. And most pleasing.</p>
        <p>And sure enough, the filletted and boned shad I bought at Citarella and Balducci's days later looked thinner than Dill's. Citarella charged $7.99 a pound and Balducci's, which has a telephone defense system as impenetrable as Saddam Hussein's, was $10.99.</p>
        <p>In the old days, when Dill's sold shad and other fish wholesale (rather than supply its own restaurant, store and takeout shop, its primary outlet now), all the sisters lined up to run through a countdown in which they had to bone 100 pounds of shad in 12 minutes. ''You roe it, you scale it, you head it, you split it, you bone it,'' Everett said as he sauted a shad with one hand and with the other stirred a crab jus so delectable I'm going to write about it next time.</p>
        <p>''We'd work 8 to 4, and at the end of the day 3,000 pounds of fish would be cleaned and ready for shipping,'' he said. I tried to persuade Leona to do it once more -- after all, there was no way I was going to be able to steal the family secret just by watching. Leona looked impish. The other sisters, their cousins, whom Everett reckons by the dozens, and their aunt just rolled their eyes.</p>
        <p>Marino's Shad Stuffed With Spinach  (adapted from Dill's Seafood)</p>
        <p>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
        <p>1/2 cup onion, finely chopped</p>

        <p>4 tablespoons cream cheese, cut into pieces</p>
        <p>1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, shredded</p>
        <p>1/2 cup Monterey Jack cheese, shredded</p>
        <p>Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p>
        <p>3 tablespoons toasted bread crumbs</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons grated pecorino Romano</p>
        <p>2 teaspoons parsley or cilantro, finely chopped</p>
        <p>2 boneless shad fillets, about</p>
        <p>3/4 pounds each</p>
        <p>1 cup onion, very thinly sliced</p>
        <p>Paprika.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.</p>
        <p>2. In 2 tablespoons of butter, saute the onion and 1 teaspoon of garlic until transparent. Stir in 2 tablespoons of wine. Add the spinach, cover and cook over low heat for 5 minutes. Stir in the cream cheese, mozzarella and Monterey Jack. Add another teaspoon of garlic. Season with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>3. In a small bowl, combine the bread crumbs, pecorino, parsley and remaining garlic.</p>
        <p>4. Place the shad, skin side down, on a well-buttered baking dish and season with salt and pepper. Spoon the spinach filling under the flaps and pat them closed. Top with the bread-crumb mixture, then the sliced onion. Sprinkle on paprika and the rest of the wine and dot with the remaining butter.</p>
        <p>5. Cover with aluminum foil and bake 25-30 minutes. Uncover and brown under the broiler.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
        <p>Thomas Jefferson's Shad-Roe Souffle  (adapted from ''American FolkLife Cookbook,'' by Joan Nathan, Schocken Books)</p>
        <p>3/4 pound fresh shad roe</p>
        <p>1 bay leaf</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon lemon juice</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
        <p>1 small onion, finely chopped</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons flour</p>
        <p>1/4 cup strained liquid from parboiling roe</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons fresh parsley or cilantro, chopped</p>
        <p>2 egg yolks</p>
        <p>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</p>
        <p>5 egg whites</p>
        <p>Paprika</p>
        <p>12 slices bacon, cooked crisp and drained (optional).</p>
        <p>1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees.</p>
        <p>2. Gently parboil the roe in water to cover, with the bay leaf, lemon juice and salt, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain and reserve  1/4 cup of the liquid.</p>
        <p>3. Remove the roe's outer membrane and veins.</p>
        <p>4. Saute the onion in the butter until transparent. Add the roe, break it gently with a fork and sprinkle with flour until well coated. Blend in the reserved liquid, cool for a few minutes and add the parsley. Stir in the yolks. Add salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>5. Beat egg whites until stiff but not dry. Stir  1/4of them into the roe mixture. Fold in the rest. Place in a buttered 1-quart souffle dish, sprinkle with paprika and bake in a pan of boiling water for 35 minutes. Serve bacon on the side or crumbled on top.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4-6 servings.</p>
