        <p>FEARING a national monopoly in the military aircraft business, the Pentagon is now rethinking a decision to award a $200 billion jet fighter contract, the largest in its history, to a single company.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon's ''winner take all'' competition has pitted Lockheed Martin against Boeing in what was once seen as a bold effort to bring commercial practices to the Defense Department.</p>
        <p>But now the government fears that the nation could be left with only a single supplier as it begins to build the next-generation fighter jets, the Joint Strike Fighters, which will replace aging F-16's and other planes.</p>
        <p>While the Pentagon has not announced its intention to split the contract, there are signs that it may soon. It recently set up a panel to decide whether having a single winner still made sense. Both Boeing and Lockheed have been asked by the Pentagon to come up with plans to share the contract, and top Pentagon officials have questioned whether having a single supplier is wise.</p>
        <p>In late April, in a meeting with investors, Vance D. Coffman, chief executive of Lockheed, repeated an earlier statement that the ''odds are more than 50-50'' that the Pentagon will divide the contract, which is expected to produce more than 3,000 planes.</p>
        <p>And in a speech on April 19, Frank Statkus, Boeing's vice president for the program, said, ''A winner-take-all is not going to be the end scenario.''</p>
        <p>Yet in making this analysis, the Pentagon is caught between trying to protect an industrial base and trying to reduce costs. If it splits the contract, the overall cost will surely rise, because the Pentagon will have to support two manufacturing processes instead of one. For now, there are no estimates of the effect on the program's price.</p>
        <p>''Any time you have two biggies, like Lockheed and Boeing, sparring on how they will carve up the goodies,'' said Eugene J. Carroll, vice president of the Center for Defense Information, a Washington nonprofit group, ''the compromises tend to favor the companies' interests and Uncle Sam ends up footing the bill for additional costs.''</p>
        <p>BUT Mr. Carroll, a retired admiral and a frequent Pentagon critic, said a split contract was inevitable. ''It's not a question of whether it is good or bad,'' he said. ''It's a question of what else the Pentagon could do when you are down to just two players.''</p>
        <p>The Pentagon has not commented. Its committee, a three-member panel, could make a decision as early as this month.</p>
        <p>Still, top Pentagon officials have hinted of a change. Air Force Secretary Whitten Peters, in recent Congressional testimony, said the Pentagon was concerned that ''given the current state of the defense industry, going to a single contractor at this time could effectively leave us with a single contractor for many years.'' Other top officials, including former Defense Under Secretary John J. Hamre, have made similar statements recently.</p>
        <p>Many factors go into the Pentagon's thinking, ranging from election-year politics to the current depressed state of military industry stocks to concerns that the decadelong consolidation among military contractors may have gone too far, especially now that only two makers of fighter aircraft remain and there is little new business.</p>
        <p>''The Pentagon has discovered that this program is so big that awarding it to one company effectively creates a fighter aircraft monopoly,'' said Loren B. Thompson, a military industry analyst at the Lexington Institute, an Arlington, Va., research group. ''There would be no business left for anyone else to pursue, so they have no choice.''</p>
        <p>Jon B. Kutler, a military industry expert and president of Quarterdeck Investment Partners of Los Angeles, added, ''If it was winner-take-all, the loser might as well turn over the keys to the plant.''</p>
        <p>The Joint Strike Fighter is an experiment both in how the Pentagon does business and in the use of new technology. The plane is to be a low-cost, single-engine, single-pilot fighter that can be used by all three services and sold to NATO allies. It must fly faster than the speed of sound, be invisible to enemy radar and, because of streamlined production techniques, be produced for what by Pentagon standards is a bargain-basement price -- around $30 million a plane.</p>
        <p>Part of the cost savings were to result from the plane's being produced by a single company, meaning that only one production line would need to be kept open, not two. Other savings would come from using new technologies in design and production, as well as from operating efficiencies. The Senate Armed Services Committee, wanting to make sure engineering problems are resolved, is urging a six-month delay for the plane. And last week, the General Accounting office agreed, but said any delay should not be interpreted as a lessening of support for the fighter.</p>
        <p>Much has changed since the program was conceived nearly a decade ago. Procurement dollars -- representing what the Pentagon spends on new equipment -- have fallen steadily over the last decade. They hit a low of around $60 billion a year, and have only now begun to trend slightly upward. This means the Pentagon has little business to sprinkle over the military industry other than the Joint Strike Fighter.</p>
        <p>And it is an election year. The leading Pentagon backers of the fighter, Defense Secretary William S. Cohen and the Pentagon acquisitions chief, Jacques S. Gansler, are political appointees and are likely to be replaced after January. The more the program's work can be spread across more states, more employees and more companies, the greater the constituency for this program in Congress -- even after its main supporters leave town.</p>
        <p>NO one wants to alienate any large voting bloc, or important contributor, during an election year -- which could happen if only one company is selected. ''If you split the contract, you can keep everyone happy,'' said Mr. Kutler of Quarterdeck. ''You will have fewer people to lobby and vote against you.''</p>
        <p>In the last few years, the government has begun to take a dimmer view of the shrinking military base, having denied several proposed corporate mergers, like the acquisition of Northrop Grumman by Lockheed, and consolidations in military shipbuilding.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Wall Street has rewarded faster-growing high-technology companies with fresh capital and bypassed military companies, making them even more dependent on Pentagon dollars.</p>
        <p>''Wall Street would hate winner-take-all,'' said Charles Gabriel, a Washington-based analyst for Prudential Securities.</p>
        <p>Howard A. Rubel, an analyst with Goldman Sachs, added, ''It's not so much a question of who will win but how the contract can be structured so the industry earns adequate returns.''</p>
        <p>There has been some thought that the Joint Strike Fighter would not have to have two full assembly lines, but that part of it could be made by Lockheed in Texas and part by Boeing in Seattle. For instance, the current F-22 is made in various places in the United States, but assembled at one site.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Carroll says, this is how costs rise. ''Once politics enter into it, you will have Congressional delegations from Seattle, from Texas, from St. Louis and everywhere wanting their share of this contract. There will be a lot of logs to be rolled.''</p>
