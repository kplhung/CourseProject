Dan Montez, director of Taconic Opera's current production, ''Cosi Fan Tutte,'' says he rarely presents operas the old-fashioned way, set in their own time periods.

        <p>This ''Cosi'' takes place on an unnamed planet two hundred years from now, and yes, women are still like that, fickle creatures who cannot be faithful to their lovers. The scheming men who have placed temptation in the women's path do not get off scot-free, however. Mr. Montez will not reveal the ending, but he describes it as vastly satisfying. ''Everybody is so shallow and despicable by the end that you wonder how they can just make up'' as they usually do, he said. In this production, ''the subtext is how people would genuinely act.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Montez said he borrowed the ending from the San Francisco Opera, whose audiences stood and applauded the modern twist. The opera, conducted by Neal Goren, can be seen at the Yorktown Stage in Yorktown on Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. and Sunday at 2 p.m. The production features two separate casts, a full orchestra and English supertitles. Tickets, from $32 to $47, can be reserved by calling 739-2165.</p>
