        <p>Ever wonder why loose cotton pants are called bloomers? Apparently, they're named after Amelia Bloomer, a 19th-century women's rights advocate and newspaper editor who flouted the corsets and hoop skirts of her day by wearing loose pantaloons under a short skirt. Her story is told in YOU FORGOT YOUR SKIRT, AMELIA BLOOMER! (Scholastic, $16.95; ages 4 to 8), an appealing picture book by Shana Corey, illustrated with style and wit by Chesley McLaren.</p>
        <p>The women's rights message, overt in lines like ''Amelia Bloomer thought it was silly that proper ladies were not supposed to work,'' is never heavy-handed. Instead, it is carried by the engaging tale of the decidedly improper Amelia and her friends. Elizabeth Cady Stanton just comes to visit one day with her cousin Libby. The details of Amelia's life in Seneca Falls, N.Y., a suffragist hotbed, are saved for an author's note at the end.</p>

        <p>Ever wonder why loose cotton pants are called bloomers? Apparently, they're named after Amelia Bloomer, a 19th-century women's rights advocate and newspaper editor who flouted the corsets and hoop skirts of her day by wearing loose pantaloons under a short skirt. Her story is told in YOU FORGOT YOUR SKIRT, AMELIA BLOOMER! (Scholastic, $16.95; ages 4 to 8), an appealing picture book by Shana Corey, illustrated with style and wit by Chesley McLaren.</p>
        <p>The women's rights message, overt in lines like ''Amelia Bloomer thought it was silly that proper ladies were not supposed to work,'' is never heavy-handed. Instead, it is carried by the engaging tale of the decidedly improper Amelia and her friends. Elizabeth Cady Stanton just comes to visit one day with her cousin Libby. The details of Amelia's life in Seneca Falls, N.Y., a suffragist hotbed, are saved for an author's note at the end.</p>
        <p>That's also where we learn that Amelia and other bloomer-wearers eventually abandoned the costume because they didn't want to detract attention from the woman suffrage movement. But the story ends on a positive note: the influence of Amelia Bloomer is implied in a blithe illustration showing contemporary young women in bluejeans and bell-bottoms.</p>
        <p>Every page is enhanced by McLaren's witty and colorful gouache illustrations. The scene of ''proper'' ladies fainting from too-tight corsets is particularly amusing (''What was proper about that?''). The book jacket includes instructions for turning it into a poster, and the offer is tempting. ''You Forgot Your Skirt, Amelia Bloomer!'' is a picture book girls are likely to love, because it encourages them to be improper, something most young girls need little urging to attempt. The trick is to think of improper as nonconformist instead of rude.</p>
