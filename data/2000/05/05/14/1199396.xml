        <p>A 200-year-old tree grows in Brooklyn. Another inspired the borough's unofficial poet laureate, Marianne Moore, to write about ''the filigree of an elm overhead'' that she named ''our crowning curio.''</p>
        <p>They are among the 105 trees chosen from 2.5 million other natural skyscrapers for ''Great Trees of New York City,'' a new book published by the Parks and Recreation Department.</p>
        <p>The 48-page guide lists  the most important trees and groves that tell the history of New York, Commissioner Henry J. Stern wrote in the introduction. The book, which arrived in city bookstores and museums this month, was intended to encourage self-guided tours.</p>
        <p>''Trees are our living landmarks,'' Mr. Stern explained. ''What the city's  landmarks commission did for buildings, I wanted to do for trees.''</p>
        <p>The trees are brought to life through colorful descriptions and black-and-white photographs that capture their majestic spans and soaring heights, as well as their perseverance in a city inhospitable to nature.</p>
        <p>One picture shows two blossoming cherry trees along the Central Park Reservoir towering over the distant high-rises of the Upper West Side. According to the guide, the cherry trees were given to the city by the Japanese government in 1912,  part of the same arboreal gift that attracts tourists to  Washington each spring.</p>
        <p>Many trees originated in foreign soil. ''That New York is a city of immigrants is as true for its trees as for its people,'' wrote Benjamin Swett, director of the department's Parks in Print program and the book's principal photographer and author.</p>
        <p>Other trees were included for their unusual features, including a 150-foot-tall tulip tree in the Riverdale section of the Bronx that has a cavity the size of ''a small bathroom,'' according to Mr. Swett.</p>
        <p>''These trees aren't necessarily the biggest or oldest, but the ones nominated by their communities because they are important to residents,'' he said in an interview.</p>
        <p>The book grew out of a tree census conducted by volunteers in 1985. ''We count people every 10 years, why not trees?'' Mr. Stern asked. A tree enthusiast named Gordon Helman took it upon himself in 1990 to supplement those findings in a handmade booklet that paired historical facts with literary asides. When Mr. Helman died in 1996, Mr. Stern pledged at his memorial to dedicate a new book in his memory.</p>
        <p>''Our trees have never been treated with the proper respect,'' Mr. Stern said. ''One day we will be judged by how we treat other species and life forms.''</p>
