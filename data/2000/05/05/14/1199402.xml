        <p>HAVE you heard the noise?</p>
        <p>Madelyn Wils has. A longtime resident of TriBeCa, where three- and four-star restaurants make their home, she listens every evening as motorists honk their horns at double- and triple-parked limousines and their well-dressed passengers, who bark into cell phones as they arrive and depart.</p>
        <p>''It's like the movie 'Network,' where the characters yell, 'I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take it any more,' '' said Ms. Wils, a freelance television producer, complaining about yet another restaurant that recently applied for permission to open on Duane Street, where she lives. ''That's what my neighbors and I are saying now.''</p>
        <p>Marcia Lemmon, chairwoman of the Ludlow Street Block Association, has also heard the noise. She lives on the Lower East Side, where the freewheeling drug traffic of a decade ago has been replaced by residential gentrification and an explosion in cacophonous bars and ''scene'' restaurants. On Orchard Street alone she has counted seven places that serve liquor.</p>
        <p>''People have said to me that they look back on the time of the drugs as the halcyon days of the neighborhood,'' Ms. Lemmon said, ''especially compared to now, with the noise, taxis and yelling in the street.''</p>
        <p>For Max Strauss, who runs an aluminum recycling business and lives in an apartment facing West 67th Street, just off Central Park West, the din is ''just off the scale.'' He blames Makor, a Jewish cultural center that opened on the block last fall and runs evening programs aimed at young singles.</p>
        <p>''You can feel the music vibrating through the walls,'' said Mr. Strauss, who added that he and his wife are so frustrated they plan to knock through the walls of another apartment they own in the back of their building and move their bedroom there, away from the commotion.</p>
        <p>''We're lucky that we can do that,'' he said. ''Otherwise, we'd have to move.''</p>
        <p>Noise has always been a part of Manhattan life. But in recent years, people have moved to areas where few, if any, used to live. Spurred by a red-hot economy, they are also demanding, and getting, entertainment in those neighborhoods, as well as in communities that have traditionally been residential.</p>
        <p>As a result, the disturbances drawing public ire are not just the jackhammers, car alarms and fire sirens that have long assaulted urban eardrums. Today, nearly everywhere around town, people are also complaining about restaurants, movie theaters, clubs, bars and other gathering places. Many of those complaining were raised outside the city in quieter places and are unwilling to accept the growing din.</p>
        <p>Attend a meeting of virtually any community group, and you will hear the same story: despite a stricter city noise code, the racket is growing.</p>
        <p>Increasing numbers of residents say they want offending establishments exiled to the fringes of the city or kicked out of Manhattan altogether.</p>
        <p>In some cases, they are succeeding. In 1997, Manhattan State Supreme Court Justice Sheila Abdus-Salaam overturned a liquor license that had been approved for a bar at 72 Grand Street in SoHo, ruling that the detriment to the community far outweighed any gain to it. In 1998, the State Liquor Authority rejected a license application  from a bar at 76 Wooster Street, also in SoHo. It was one of the few times the agency had refused to grant a license for the sake of neighborhood tranquillity.</p>
        <p>In February, Justice Franklin R. Weissberg of State Supreme Court in Manhattan  rejected an application for a license for a proposed nightclub at 372 Broadway, south of Canal Street, on the ground that the club was likely to disrupt the community. The club would have occupied an old four-story building next to a residential high-rise surrounded by stores selling fabric, futons and discount jeans. At night, when the stores are  closed, the area is silent save for a few cars and trucks heading down Broadway.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if it's a change in people's sensibilities or if the noise is actually louder,'' said Charles G. Sturcken, chief of staff of the city Department of Environmental Protection, which fields so-called quality of life complaints on a 24-hour phone line. In the last year or two, he said, far more people seem to be complaining about noise from social events and gathering places than ever before.</p>
        <p>Judy Duffy, the assistant manager for Community Board 1, said of the din from restaurants, clubs and bars, ''It is the most increased kind of complaint we've seen in the last few years.''</p>
        <p>Her district includes much of Lower Manhattan, where, she said, such noise is ''more and more the key issue.'' Even normal conversation on the street occasionally provokes the wrath of residents.</p>
        <p>''We just flat out have more people living here and more people coming here,'' Ms. Duffy said. ''And people make noise.''</p>
        <p>Now, the Once-Sleepless City Dreams of Peace and Quiet</p>
        <p>To New Yorkers, it used to be a matter of civic pride that this was the city that never slept. Manhattan, especially, was a mix, a hodgepodge of homes, stores, theaters, restaurants and bars. And that was fine with New Yorkers, who wanted to be able to buy a quart of milk in their neighborhoods, or go out for a drink, a meal or a show.</p>
        <p>But that was when the populace had a greater ''tradition of tolerance for noise'' than it does today, said Philip Kasinitz, a professor of sociology at Hunter College and the City University Graduate Center, who specializes in urban affairs.</p>
        <p>With elevated trains screeching past and windows open on summer nights, ''there were different norms of noise,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Times changed. In the 1950's and 60's, great waves of newly affluent or at least middle-class young families packed up and headed for the quiet of the suburbs. Then times changed again. Many grown children of the suburbs returned to Manhattan and many of them are raising their families here, preferring the verve and excitement of the city to what they perceived as the boredom and sterility of the suburbs.</p>
        <p>Yet despite their enthusiasm for urban life, these returnees and other new Manhattanites have acquired ''certain expectations of behavior that are really quite suburban,'' Professor Kasinitz said.</p>
        <p>They feel entitled to conditions similar to those that prevailed in the places they were raised. ''Like peace and quiet,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But there are other reasons for the new militancy against party noise. A major one is the influx of New Yorkers moving into marginally residential or newly gentrified areas like TriBeCa, the Lower East Side, far west Chelsea and the East Village, where elevated noise levels might be expected. The city's prosperity also results in more noise, largely because of the peculiarities of the city's zoning regulations, in which commercial districts are overlaid on Manhattan's residential neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>As a result, many of the worst offenses occur in places where New Yorkers have always lived, like the Upper East Side or the block on West 67th Street where Max Strauss and his neighbors suffer.</p>
        <p>As Joseph B. Rose, director of the Department of City Planning, points out, Manhattan is a small place, and the commercial heart of the city. If the city is to thrive, he said, both residential and commercial uses must coexist on one relatively tiny island. In Manhattan, unlike the suburbs, there is  hardly any residential-only zoning, and even historically residential areas are studded with restaurants, clubs and bars. In boom times, coexistence between the two worlds is increasingly precarious.</p>
        <p>''The goal of land use regulation is to achieve and maintain a balance, and noise per se is not a general land use issue,'' Mr. Rose said. ''We are not going to do away with the commercial overlay on residential areas in Manhattan.''</p>
        <p>Problems of Prosperity In the East Village</p>
        <p>One neighborhood where the problem has become particularly intense in recent years is the East Village.</p>
        <p>From Second Avenue to the East River, the area is zoned as a general residence district, with restrictions on building size, height and uses. On the avenues, however, and some side streets, zoning allows commercial uses, which can include everything from antiques stores to supermarkets to shoe repair shops to bars.</p>
        <p>Once an impoverished haven for drug dealers, the East Village was increasingly gentrified in the last decade. It also became host to several New York University dormitories.</p>
        <p>Lisa Ramaci, a member of Community Board 3, said the presence of students led to the opening of dozens of bars and clubs, many of which displaced delis, dry cleaners, shoe repair shops and other businesses that could not pay higher rents.</p>
        <p>''You now have wolf packs of 20-somethings roaming residential side streets at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, screaming, kicking over garbage cans and fighting,'' Ms. Ramaci said.</p>
        <p>''There are also plenty with fake ID's,'' she said. ''It's like Disneyland East.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Ramaci cited the Cock, a bar at 188 Avenue A at East 12th Street, as an example.</p>
        <p>The Cock was cited seven times between spring 1997 and summer 1999 for violations  like selling alcohol to minors and after-hours operations. During that period, it was  fined $20,000.</p>
        <p>Davis Tong, the building's owner, declined to comment on the present status of the Cock, and the club's owner, Allan Mannarelli, could not be reached.</p>
        <p>In December, the liquor authority suspended the bar's license, citing multiple violations, and shut it down for 30 days. But the bar has since reopened. The music is so loud, Ms. Ramaci said, ''you have to plug your ears as you go by.''</p>
        <p>Not even the prospect of college finals could deter midweek revelers from visiting Avenue A on a recent weeknight. Well after midnight, the street was filled with knots of people in various stages of tipsiness, laughing and talking loudly.</p>
        <p>At the Cock and other bars, like the Raven near 13th Street, loud, percussive music drifted out the door.</p>
        <p>If You Can't Throw Them Out, Zone Them Out</p>
        <p>One way to improve the situation is to redefine the kinds of businesses that can operate in a certain place. Mr. Rose said the City Planning Department would recommend some modifications along those lines later this spring as part of a major overhaul of the city's 1961 Zoning Resolution.</p>
        <p>The City Council has the power to enact zoning changes. But the Council usually acts only in tandem with the planning department. As a result, one proposal to modify uses allowed in specific neighborhoods, made two years ago, has been languishing in committee with little chance of passage.</p>
        <p>In October 1997, the Council did pass a law drastically increasing the penalties for multiple violations of the noise code. Establishments that repeatedly ''cause or permit'' music louder than 45 decibels to be heard in neighboring residences can be fined up to $24,000; the maximum fine had been $8,000. (For purposes of comparison, normal conversation is 60 decibels, while the level for the audience of a rock concert can be 115 decibels or more.)</p>
        <p>But there is no agreement on whether the new law has been effective.</p>
        <p>''We can't see any correlation between the change in fines and the number of summonses or complaints one way or the other,'' said John Scanlon, chief of patrol for the Police Department. He and Mr. Sturcken of the Department of Environmental Protection both said that the number of calls to their agencies' complaint lines went way up when the change in the law was first made public, but had since fallen off.</p>
        <p>''Most people don't bother to call up to complain about noise,'' said Ms. Duffy of Community Board 1. Instead, people tend to complain at community meetings.</p>
        <p>Even A. Gifford Miller, the councilman from the Upper East Side of Manhattan who sponsored the bill, is qualified in his assessment of the harsher penalties.</p>
        <p>''It deals only with repeat offenders,'' he said, ''and there are lots of cases of people who are not being repeatedly cited.''</p>
        <p>''We've still got a long way to go,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Community groups agree. Frustrated at their inability to remove offending businesses and social halls from their neighborhoods  through zoning, they have turned to the courts and other government agencies, with varying degrees of success.</p>
        <p>Most turn first to the State Liquor Authority. By law, all bars and restaurants serving alcohol must be licensed by the authority. Community boards review the appropriateness of each prospective license, and forward their findings to the authority. Although their recommendations are only advisory, most boards take their role seriously, as do their constituents.</p>
        <p>''In some ways, people are treating us as if we were the zoning agency,'' said Ms. Duffy of Community Board 1.</p>
        <p>Some boards act as if they were. Even though licensed establishments in Manhattan may stay open until 4 a.m., Community Board 4 in Chelsea recently recommended to the liquor agency that a planned restaurant to be called Chelsea Place be granted a license only on the condition that it close at 2 a.m., and that its owners meet monthly with board members to deal with any problems.</p>
        <p>The owners agreed to some of the conditions, including the 2 a.m. closing. They promised that Chelsea Place would remain a restaurant and not become a bar or a club, as has happened with other establishments in the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>''I call it morphing,'' said Maria Garcia, a member of the community board. She fears that the restaurant may try to amend its license if it can show some kind of hardship.</p>
        <p>''The liquor authority is there to keep places in business,'' she said. ''If that happens, they're never going to close down a place like this.''</p>
        <p>Her misgivings are shared by members of many Manhattan community boards. As a result, most concentrate their efforts on stopping new bars from opening altogether.</p>
        <p>Their recommendations center on the so-called 500-foot law passed by the State Legislature in 1993. That law forbids any new drinking establishment if there are already three others within a 500-foot radius. The law permits exemptions, however, if the authority finds that they are in the public interest.</p>
        <p>Public interest can mean many things, like increases in jobs and tax revenues. Over the years, many bars and restaurants that fall within the purview of the 500-foot law have received licenses on that basis, despite opposition from some residents.</p>
        <p>Fighting Back, And Sometimes Winning</p>
        <p>But residents have been fighting back, and sometimes they have won. One recent victory involved a building at 372 Broadway, on the border of TriBeCa and Chinatown. Last year the liquor agency turned down a proposal by the Bowery Room Corporation, which had previously run a club in Greenwich Village, to open a nightclub there.</p>
        <p>Community board members, the East TriBeCa Community Association, a local group, and Councilwoman Kathryn E. Freed banded together to oppose the granting of a liquor license. They contended that the area had become increasingly residential during the last few years, and that the proposed club, which would have had more than 10,000 square feet on three floors, accommodating 800 patrons, was simply too much for the neighborhood. The liquor agency agreed, and its decision was upheld in State Supreme Court.</p>
        <p>''I think there's been a real turnaround with the State Liquor Authority,'' said Barry Mallin, the lawyer who represented local groups in the case. In other words, licenses are no longer approved without question.</p>
        <p>In other neighborhoods, like the East Village, the authority has allowed dozens of bars to open, many on the same block. The authority's willingness to defer to community concern is of no help when there is no liquor license, as in the case of Makor, the Jewish social center on West 67th Street, where residents complained of loud music and noisy young people on the street.</p>
        <p>Because of the growing protest, there is concern on the part of many of the city's clubs and restaurants. One person who is especially worried is Robert Bookman, the lawyer for the New York Nightlife Association, a trade group representing about 80 cabaret, bar and restaurant owners.</p>
        <p>He acknowledges that there are bars and clubs at which patrons are unruly. But he asserts that many neighbors have ''unrealistic expectations'' about the amount of noise that is appropriate in the city.</p>
        <p>He also contends that the police often cite clubs and bars as offenders when their customers should be blamed. ''If a patron after a hockey game gets into a fight in the street,'' he wrote in a recent issue of his association's newsletter, ''Madison Square Garden is not issued a summons.''</p>
        <p>Mostly, though, Mr. Bookman says, outdated zoning is at the heart of the problem.</p>
        <p>''Nightclubs always explored new areas of the city, opened new neighborhoods,'' he said. ''Now these neighborhoods are increasingly residential, and there is no place where there isn't some sort of opposition.''</p>
        <p>''You can have a place on the West Side Highway, and then people will move in next door,'' he said. As a result, ''professional entrepreneurs are looking to other cities'' like Aspen, Los Angeles or Miami, all of which he called more business-friendly.</p>
        <p>Such an exodus would undoubtedly delight opponents of noisy bars and restaurants,  like Ms. Ramaci of Community Board 3, who said she would welcome the return of ''the shoe repair shops, dry cleaners and pet food stores that the clubs have driven from the neighborhood,'' not to mention ''a good night's sleep.''</p>
        <p>But it would bode ill for New York's nightlife industry, which entertains 24 million patrons annually, Mr. Bookman said.</p>
        <p>''If the trend continues, it will change the city,'' he said. ''And not for the better.''</p>
