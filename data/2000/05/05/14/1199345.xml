        <p>THE temptation to mourn for summer as it used to be is overwhelming for New Jerseyans of a certain age. As they queue up for an overpriced shore rental or write out yet another check for yet another kiddie soccer camp, computer camp, theater camp, they emit the universal sigh: ''Whatever happened to lazy days at the swimming hole, the neighborhood softball game, the summer day spent doing nothing but playing tic-tac-toe with chalk on the sidewalk?''</p>

        <p>THE temptation to mourn for summer as it used to be is overwhelming for New Jerseyans of a certain age. As they queue up for an overpriced shore rental or write out yet another check for yet another kiddie soccer camp, computer camp, theater camp, they emit the universal sigh: ''Whatever happened to lazy days at the swimming hole, the neighborhood softball game, the summer day spent doing nothing but playing tic-tac-toe with chalk on the sidewalk?''</p>
        <p>Yet summer nostalgia is not a particularly new sentiment. Look backward and it's easy to find other summertimes when, at a particular moment in a particular place, people must have been suddenly struck by the realization that summer, and life in general, had been changed for good.</p>
        <p>Take, for instance, Aug. 25, 1905, when 20,000 people came to the boardwalk in Cape May to watch two days of racing featuring those newfangled things, automobiles. Although cars were becoming more common, it was by no means clear in 1905 what the ultimate role of the automobile was going to be. Many people just plain didn't like the noisy contraptions; some, who came of age in the just-departed Victorian era, thought they threatened the very foundations of society.</p>
        <p>So it must have been more than a little disconcerting to some in the crowd at Cape May that day when one of the short races, for cars up to 30 horsepower driven from a standing start, was won by a woman. Mrs. Clarence Cecil Fitler took the contest in a 28-horsepower Packard.</p>
        <p>The next day the old guard was dealt another blow when Mrs. Fitler won two more races, one-milers, again in the Packard. Her best time was 1 minute 13 seconds. So unusual were such victories by a woman that The New York Times, in its news story, felt compelled to veer from objective reportage.</p>
        <p>''She deserved her honors,'' the newspaper said, ''for she drove with skill and judgment.'' (She certainly drove with more skill and judgment than a fellow named A. L. Campbell, who in trying to pass a car in his race ''ran out into the ocean, sending up clouds of foam.'')</p>
        <p>It is easy to imagine that many in the crowd must have been left scratching their heads by Mrs. Fitler's achievements. ''These danged cars are everywhere,'' they might have said, ''and now women are driving them! Summers aren't supposed to be like this.'' Such forebodings would prove accurate, of course. Cars would quickly become ubiquitous. Summer would soon be largely defined by driving. And, yes, much of that driving would be done by women.</p>
        <p>Michael J. Launay, proprietor of the Web site New Jersey History's Mysteries, (members.xoom.com/ launaymi1/index.htm) nominated another moment when people must have felt a sudden longing for a simpler, and certainly safer, type of summer. It was the summer of 1916, when, 59 years before the movie ''Jaws,'' New Jersey had its own true-life horror in the water.</p>
        <p>On July 1, 1916, a 25-year-old Philadelphia student was attacked 50 feet offshore at Beach Haven by a large shark. He died the next day. Five days later at Spring Lake, about 30 miles north, a young bellboy was swimming a few hundred feet from shore when he began to scream. When he was pulled onto land, his rescuers found that both of his legs had been torn from his body. He died on the beach.</p>
        <p>A full panic developed. Jersey Shore businessmen tried to save the  season by enclosing the bathing areas in wire netting and establishing motorboat patrols.</p>
        <p>BUT, Mr. Launay related, just as everyone began to think it was safe to return to the water, on July 12 a boy swimming in the creek at Matawan  disappeared. It seemed an unlikely spot for a shark -- Matawan lies 11 miles inland from the Raritan Bay, linked to it by the creek -- but moments before the attack a fisherman had seen an underwater shadow moving upstream and had known exactly what he was looking at.</p>
        <p>The fisherman, in fact, had tried to sound a warning, but too late for the boy, and for a rescuer who ran to the child's aid and was also mauled. Both died. On its way back downstream the shark bit a teenage boy; he lived.</p>
        <p>Three days after the attack at Matawan -- and after a deluge of international publicity -- a nine-foot great white shark was caught in the Raritan Bay. Human remains were found in its stomach.</p>
        <p>The attacks ceased, but the fear lingered. Again, it's easy to imagine people at the time wondering whether summer would ever be the same. And, in a way, it would not. The shark scare eventually subsided, but others replaced it: fear of pollution, of red tide, of hypodermic needles and other medical waste washing up on the sand. The beach lost its innocence.</p>
        <p>A decade later there was a more frivolous -- but still, no doubt, discomforting -- loss of innocence, one involving clothing and dance steps. On the Fourth of July weekend in 1925, Atlantic City, apparently moved by a revealing turn in women's bathing-suit fashions, announced that it was determined to enforce a city law that forbade bathers to go to and from the beach without some kind of cloak over their suits. A newspaper account of the day related that the crackdown had at least one beneficiary: an enterprising young man opened a robe-rental business, charging 10 cents.</p>
        <p>BUT that was just the beginning in a summer that challenged all sorts of mores. On July 25, the city issued an order banning women at the Million-Dollar Pier from dancing without stockings. The New York Times reported that the order was deemed necessary ''after a number of pretty girls had appeared on the dance floor . . . in extremely short skirts and with bare legs.'' Henceforth, the paper said, the rules dictated that dancers' outfits ''must include hosiery, even if only of the almost invisible variety.''</p>
        <p>That same day in Bradley Beach, Mayor Frank C. Borden Jr. banned the Charleston from the dance floor of the municipally owned casino, asserting that the dance was dangerous, frequently resulting in broken shins.</p>
        <p>''I have no objection to a person dancing their feet and head off,'' the mayor said, ''but I think it best that they keep away from the Charleston.'' Surely, by the time that scandalous summer ended, many shore residents and visitors were longing for the simpler, more decorous summers of their youths.</p>
        <p>But not all watershed moments from summers past are negative. Robert Santelli, a former New Jerseyan who is now vice president of education and public programs at the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, nominated Memorial Day weekend 1976. That, he said, was when New Jersey shared one of its greatest assets with the world.</p>
        <p>The previous October, Time and Newsweek magazines had primed the pump with their famous simultaneous cover stories on Bruce Springsteen. But fall and winter are not really high season for rock 'n' roll; summer is. So it was left to a summer-opening concert at the Stone Pony, the now legendary Asbury Park club, to finish the job.</p>
        <p>The concert, Mr. Santelli said, was headlined by Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes, and many of the big names of Jersey Shore rock were there -- big names locally, but largely unknown elsewhere. The concert changed all that, Mr. Santelli said, because it was broadcast live over a national network of radio stations.</p>
        <p>T HAT was a defining moment in Jersey Shore rock history,'' he said. ''What we had going on there was pretty much a well-kept secret until then.''</p>
        <p>Afterward, Mr. Santelli said, both tourists and record company scouts discovered the clubs of the Jersey Shore. ''It gave Jersey a credibility in rock 'n' roll that it still has to this day,'' he said. And again -- this time in a positive way -- summer, and life, would never be the same. The New Jersey chic that continues today with Whitman-for-Vice-President talk and ''Sopranos'' mania can be thought of as having roots in that weekend.</p>
        <p>There are, of course, many more such sea-change episodes, many of them more profound than the anecdotes cited here -- summers of racial strife in Camden and Newark, summers of young men suiting up for war. For those tempted to wonder what happened to summer as it used to be, it's all fodder for a reassessment. Perhaps summer isn't something that used to be one way and now isn't; perhaps it's an ever-evolving process.</p>
