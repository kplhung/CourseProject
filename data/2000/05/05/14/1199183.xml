        <p>It was just an ordinary day in the life of Britain's most prominent working couple when Cherie Blair dropped in unannounced on her husband, Tony, the British prime minister, as he went about the nation's business in his Downing Street office.</p>
        <p>Nothing surprising about that. The official residence sports a laid-back appearance these days, with aides in shirt sleeves and loosened ties keeping up a lively banter in the corridors of British power and the wife of the prime minister frequently breezing past the busts of William Pitt and Benjamin Disraeli on her way down from the family quarters upstairs, out the famous black front door with the white numeral 10 and off to her job as one of London's top downtown lawyers.</p>
        <p>But where Blair's opponents had been trying with scant success for three years to catch the sure-footed British leader off balance, it took his wife that September day only a few minutes.</p>
        <p>''I was here at the desk writing my party conference speech,'' Blair recalls as a spring rain rattles against the windows. He looks over at the simple leather-top table in his den-size space, which is entirely free of flags and portraits or any other signs that a world leader occupies it. ''And she came to me and said, 'I've got some news for you, and it's going to be rather shocking about the family.' Well, I immediately thought there was something wrong, that there was something wrong with our kids.</p>
        <p>''She said there was nothing wrong with the kids that we had.'' He lays emphasis on the last word with a roll of his eyes. '' 'But Tony, I think we're going to have another.'</p>
        <p>''It was not a moment to forget, but I do a little because I was so shocked. Delighted, of course, but really shocked. I think I said, 'You're joking,' and she said, 'No, I'm not.' I asked, you know, all the usual questions. And I think I did get around to saying, 'That's wonderful, darling.' But that was after a few minutes.''</p>
        <p>This month Blair, 47, and Cherie, 45, are expecting their fourth child and their first in 12 years, and the newcomer is presenting Blair with a test right in his own home of his frequently voiced notions of a new, improved, up-to-date, socially advanced, even cool Britain. He is faced with widespread public anticipation that he will take some of the paternity leave that his reform-minded government has just made part of British law, and his modern-man reputation is on the line.</p>
        <p>It was his wife, who specializes in employment law, who first raised the issue, calling the attention of a London legal forum to the decision by Finland's prime minister, Paavo Lipponen, 59, to spend a week at home in March with his newborn daughter. ''I, for one, am promoting the widespread adoption of his fine example,'' she said.</p>
        <p>All eyes turned to Blair, who has made family stability a centerpiece of his mission to shed his country of its trappings of tradition and turn it into a more contemporary society. In a typical challenge, the National Childbirth Trust said, ''What Tony Blair does when his</p>
        <p>baby is born will be a very powerful signal to other men about what real men do.''</p>
        <p>Real men. When I bring up the phrase Blair winces and shifts in his chair. ''I know what people want me to say, but the truth is, if I went away and stopped taking any calls or having any conversations, it just wouldn't be real,'' he says. ''I'll take more time off. I'll try to cut down on official things. You've got to have some common sense about it. I mean, you want to spend more time with your baby, but you don't give up the job. If people want their politicians to be honest, they have to know I cannot stop being prime minister. It's not that kind of job. With all the other kids, I used to do this regularly. And it's usually my job to take care of things at night anyway. Cherie has many excellent qualities, but once she goes to sleep, it takes a minor nuclear explosion to wake her up.''</p>
        <p>The announcement itself in November was a bomb, instantly propelling Blair free of a series of parliamentary squabbles, cabinet disputes and gathering complaints about breakdowns in public services that had prompted his Conservative rivals to predict that at last his extended political honeymoon was coming to an end. The arrival of the first baby to be born to a sitting prime minister in 150 years is likely to give Blair's political fortunes a fresh bounce despite some disappointing results in local elections this month, affording him another of the repeated escapes from real damage that have prompted the right-wing Daily Telegraph to call him Teflon Tony.</p>
        <p>Exercising his power in a personal manner more akin to an American president than a British prime minister, Blair has become the most closely observed and -- despite some vocal irritation these days at his unchallenged dominance of British public life -- the most popular prime minister in history. He is lionized by the foreign politicians who pass through Whitehall and held up as a model by most of continental Europe's leaders, who have traditionally gazed across the channel with little interest in adopting the quaint customs of the people who live there.</p>
        <p>He has become a player on the world stage in what is very likely the first act of a long run. Opinion polls continue to show the Labor Party 20 points ahead of the Conservatives, and the only question about the outcome of the next election, expected a year from now, is how much Blair can preserve of the 179-seat majority in Parliament he arrived with in 1997.</p>
        <p>He has attracted international attention as a reliable go-to guy with some unflinching acts at moments marked by hesitation in other Western capitals. He was the first allied leader to pledge solidarity with President Clinton after the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke, he was the most outspoken advocate of NATO's bombing in Kosovo and he has become the allies' point man with the new Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin.</p>
        <p>When Putin looked for an introduction to the West this spring, he rang up London. The two men exchanged summit visits in St. Petersburg in March and in London in April, and the British leader bestowed upon the Russian what amounts to a Blairite benediction, the title he reserves for himself and his true believers: ''modernizer.''</p>
        <p>The transaction validated Blair's wish that modern Britain be thought of as the pivotal nation bridging Europe, a continent he says he wants to help lead, with the United States, a country he says he doesn't mind following.</p>
        <p>''This is our great strength,'' he says. ''There's no doubt in my mind that Britain has an important role with Europe and a strong relationship with the United States, and the two complement each other. I will wage perpetual war against the view that Britain should choose America rather than Europe or Europe rather than America. It is completely and utterly counterproductive for this country.''</p>
        <p>Blair freely admits taking a lot of leads from President Clinton's politics, but he has led a distinctly different personal life. There seem to be no embarrassments lurking in Blair's past or imminent eruptions of shoddy conduct in his present. For people who liked Clinton's promise but felt betrayed by his performance, Tony Blair might just be their man.</p>
        <p>Blair likes to measure his modernizing project in terms of upgrading the country's technological prowess, stocking its skills bank and keeping it on the front lines of global competition. But the coming of a baby to 10 Downing Street is casting things in more human terms. The progress of the mission may no longer be computed in just gigabytes, new job opportunities and trade figures but in less tangible things like the hours he devotes to his family, the dinners he has at home, the school meetings he attends, the postnatal duties he shares and -- for the more tangible-minded -- the pile of diapers changed on his nighttime vigil.</p>
        <p>Blair runs none of the risk that many people in temptation-laden public life do when they posture as defenders of family values and supporters of marriage. He has a solid and whisper-free 20-year union with a woman who has a remarkable career of her own and a proven dedication to balancing an oppressively busy professional life with real time at home.</p>
        <p>On arriving at 10 Downing Street, he established a routine of working habits designed to guarantee him time for his wife and children, Euan, now 16, Nicky, 14, and Kathryn, 12. State dinners were to be substituted by state lunches wherever possible. The morning hour of 7:30 to 8:30 was inviolate while he took breakfast with his family upstairs. At the other end of the day, 7:30 marked his departure from work for family dinner. The red box of working papers that accompany each British cabinet member home every day was opened in the Blair household only after the family hour.</p>
        <p>''It seems to me he has a balance between his work and family which just makes you think, Well, this is actually somebody who's more like the rest of us and therefore he's more likely to make the right call,'' says a Downing Street civil servant who is a holdover from past Conservative governments. ''That's because he's doing it against a more normal background than, say, a politician who's all work and no play, like Thatcher coming down to work at 4 in the morning.''</p>
        <p>The Blair kids' friends come over in the afternoon, and the scene is said by visitors to be the merry chaos you'd expect. ''We're very close as a family, but I think you'd be surprised to know just how completely normal our family life is,'' Blair says. ''I mean, I do the same things, more or less, as any bloke does with his kids.''</p>
        <p>Weekends are often spent at Chequers, the official country residence in Buckinghamshire where the Blairs kick a soccer ball around the grounds in the day and in the evening frequently entertain, mixing old friends from outside politics with the occasional cabinet officer and celebrities from the worlds of entertainment and sports. The Blairs go about their churchgoing faithfully but privately, with photographers encouraged to stay away.</p>
        <p>The Blairs are fiercely protective of the privacy of their children. They appear as a family in public only once each year, during their summer holidays on the continent. Otherwise, the kids are off limits, and Blair says, ''Having to be fair, in this regard, our press has behaved pretty well.'' Let that behavior lapse, however, and the Blairs strike back swiftly.</p>
        <p>When the tabloid Mail on Sunday planned to print an utterly benign account of their family life by a former nanny, Cherie Blair obtained a Saturday night injunction against publication and then threatened to sue the young woman unless she promised to honor the confidentiality clause of her employment contract. They were willing to withstand accusations of gagging the press and bullying a well-intentioned young woman to make the point that any public mention, even favorable, of their private life was out of bounds.</p>
        <p>I asked Blair if he felt he had succeeded in immunizing his children against the effects of growing up at Britain's most important address. ''So far, touch wood, we've been lucky,'' he says. ''It's very important because it isn't their fault that their dad is prime minister. They've got to live the rest of their lives, and there are two problems here. One is that their friends at school become too impressed by it and the other is in a sense they get used to it and not know that I will one day stop being prime minister. A lot of people may not then be so keen on them and all the rest of it. We teach them to choose their friends very carefully, choose friends who are real friends, and just to realize that this here, it's in some ways a magic moment for them. They're very lucky to be in a place like Downing Street and to be part of this, but in the end it will stop, life will move on and their lives have got to be lived and they've got to make the most of that.''</p>
        <p>On an afternoon I spent at No. 10 talking to Blair's associates, Blair went through the grueling prime minister's questions time at the House of Commons, trading barked insults with the Conservative leader William Hague, returned to No. 10 for a sensitive meeting with David Trimble, the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party, and then piled into a car with Cherie to attend a parents' gathering at Kathryn's school.</p>
        <p>Anji Hunter, his special assistant and a friend since they were teenagers together in Scotland, says Blair has always been that way. ''Even as a backbencher, he was never someone who hung around the tearoom or the bars,'' she says. ''At the end of the day, he would vote and go home to his family.''</p>
        <p>When Blair succeeded the wintry John Major as prime minister he began promoting Britain very effectively as a place with flash. It wasn't long before models, pop singers and movie stars began flocking to a land they called Cool Britannia, with the shiny new prime minister as its master of ceremonies. Charles Falconer, another old friend and member of the House of Lords who shared living quarters with Blair when the two were young lawyers in London, says the image was misleading.</p>
        <p>''He vastly prefers a private life to the social life that comes with being leader of the opposition or a head of government. He became an M.P. in 1983, a lawyer at 30 or slightly younger. Although he was totally involved in politics in those years, he didn't have that sort of engagement with the bits around the edges that most politicians have. He would very rarely be drinking in a bar or spending long nights in the Commons. His home has always been London; his family has always been nearby. He saw lots more of his family than many of his contemporaries did during the 80's, and now he works in the same building where his family lives. He's never been on great national campaigns like yours, and he doesn't have to be away for any length of time from his family.''</p>
        <p>Blair claims his government will always take actions mindful of their effects on family stability, and one of the five key planks in the platform for the next electoral campaign is called helping families. I ask Blair how something as public and unwieldy as government could be effective in stabilizing something as private and volatile as a family. ''I've wrestled with this for 10 years really because I believe passionately in family life,'' he says. ''It's an important part of the stability of society. That's common sense and everyone would agree. But on the other hand, if as politicians you end up kind of preaching to people about their private lives, you get into trouble very, very quickly.''</p>
        <p>His list of vehicles for government attention include tax policy, child-care support, schools, truancy, jobs for young people, flexible working hours, parental leave, sex education and opportunities for advancement for residents of inner-city neighborhoods. ''You can't substitute government for parents,'' he says, ''but you can where it is possible and sensible support family life.''</p>
        <p>Blair is more comfortable talking in family-values generalities than he is about his own family, but the subject was hard to avoid in the days following the announcement of Cherie's pregnancy. Reporters busied themselves doing the math, and they computed that the whole thing must have started sometime during the Blairs' vacation travels last summer. When they asked if the child had been conceived in England, France or Italy, Blair wasn't above noting wolfishly that any of the three were possible. Later, he said he thought England was the place. But he added, ''Not that Tuscany wasn't romantic.''</p>
        <p>Snow was falling softly at Pulkovo Airport in St. Petersburg on the March evening when the Royal Air Force VC-10 that had borne the Blairs on a three-hour flight from Edinburgh landed and taxied to a side of the field cordoned off for security. Though seven months pregnant and still holding down her job as a lawyer and part-time judge back home, Cherie Blair had gamely come along on the trip to fulfill her diplomatic duties as Blair's consort at major public appearances. The only indication of any special health precautions were large military-issue boxes marked ''Blood'' stowed in the mess area.</p>
        <p>As the motors whined down and flakes swirled by the windows, diplomats in hats with fur earflaps and officers in high-peaked Russian military caps emerged from the darkness into an eerie white glow cast from the illuminated Cyrillic letters on top of a hangar. One official on Blair's plane watched the couple descend the flight stairs and commented, ''All this scene needs is for someone to say, 'Welcome, we've been waiting for you, Mr. Bond.' ''</p>
        <p>In the back of their official black Zil limousine, Blair pulled back the pleated brown window curtains to look outside as the motorcade sped by the church domes, stately buildings, sinister-looking canals and dimly lighted side streets of the grand old city. Though he was visibly tired from two days of speeches and appearances in Scotland, and she was in her advanced state of pregnancy, they chattered excitedly like any other tourists on a new adventure.</p>
        <p>''The baby just woke up,'' she said brightly at one point and then worried out loud that her husband hadn't brought along enough clean shirts to last the journey. She said she had missed seeing him in recent days and sounded as if she meant it. The driver and Russian security man in the front seat stared stonily ahead past the snapping Union Jacks at either side of the car hood.</p>
        <p>Often outwardly affectionate with her husband, Cherie clutched his arm and rested her head on his shoulder. They snuggled and fell silent. The long following day would include meetings and news conferences with Vladimir Putin for him and a separate schedule of events with Lyudmila Putin for her. Topping it off would be Prokofiev's four-hour ''War and Peace'' at the Mariinsky Opera for both couples and then a midnight departure for the Blairs.</p>
        <p>Cherie Blair is viewed as something of a wonder woman for her ability to balance her high-powered professional life, high-visibility public life and intensely consuming private life. The secret would appear to be self-discipline and good planning, but her old friend Lord Falconer sees it differently.</p>
        <p>''The defining feature about Cherie which has made what is a quite complicated life possible for both of them is the fact that she is disorganized,'' he says. ''So she's not managed to be a really successful lawyer, mother of three children and an involved wife of the leader of the opposition and now the prime minister by great organization. She's done it by just, as it were, accepting, with a sort of 'Well, there you are, that's what happened,' completely unaffected sort of manner. Things do go wrong quite a lot, she's quite frequently late, she's often in the wrong place at the wrong time, but she makes things bearable and possible because she doesn't get in a great state about it.''</p>
        <p>He adds: ''She's also very popular, always able to connect with people, and that makes life hugely easier. It is not easy, their life, but it is so in the end because of Cherie's not being a perfectionist.''</p>
        <p>The Blairs evidently delight in spending time with each other. At a Commonwealth Conference in South Africa last year, there came a moment when the government leaders and their spouses were obliged to travel up a long escalator out of the range of television cameras. While all the other couples stood rigid and grim, the Blairs were seen holding hands and laughing and chatting animatedly.</p>
        <p>It is hard to find out much about the Blairs from their friends beyond the fact that they have a good sense of humor and are excellent company. In the preface to his 1995 biography, ''Tony Blair the Moderniser,'' Jon Sopel wrote of ''the countless friends and associates whom I have badgered to 'dish the dirt' on Blair. It is either a mark of their loyalty, my failure or the blamelessness with which Tony Blair has conducted his life that I have come up with so little in that department.''</p>
        <p>Both Cherie and Tony Blair had childhood disruptions in their own upbringings that have contributed to a fierce desire to produce a stable family of their own. In his case, it was witnessing his father get struck down in the prime of his professional life by a catastrophic stroke when Blair himself was 10. In hers, it was being abandoned by her show-business father, who then became a national symbol of serial womanizing and after-hours carousing.</p>
        <p>He was born on May 6, 1953, in Edinburgh and reared in the northern English city of Durham, where his father was a university law professor and rising figure in Conservative politics. She came from a working-class Labor family in Liverpool that fell apart when she was 7.</p>
        <p>It was that year, 1961, that her mother was left by her father, a television actor named Tony Booth, whose bent for what the British tabloids call ''crumpeteering'' was to produce five more children, three more marriages and a string of other relationships. Cherie saw little of her errant father for much of her youth, but the estrangement ended when he was severely burned in a 1979 accident and gave up drinking. He and his fourth wife, Stephanie, are now visitors to No. 10 and Chequers.</p>
        <p>Cherie and her younger sister, Lyndsey, were reared by their mother, Gale, in a small row house in Liverpool. Cherie inherited the Catholicism of her mother and the Socialist views of her father. Her commitment to feminism is said to have come from three strong women in her life -- her mother, who did odd jobs, including working in a fish-and-chips shop, her father's sister, Audrey, who lived with the family for a time, and a grandmother.</p>
        <p>Cherie was a star student at the Catholic schools she attended, and in 1972 entered the London School of Economics, where she was to top all candidates in her bar exams. She entered practice in 1976 and in 1995 was made a queen's counsel, a title held by only 10 percent of English lawyers.</p>
        <p>A year later she qualified to be an assistant recorder, the first rung on the ladder to becoming a High Court justice, her ultimate ambition. During the election campaign, she and her husband made it clear that she would be returning to work once the election was over, and just days after the family moved into Downing Street she was seated in a high-backed judge's chair in the Mayor's and City of London Court presiding over a workers' compensation case. She is the first spouse of a British prime minister to hold a full-time job, and her Downing Street stationery carries her professional name, Cherie Booth.</p>
        <p>There is no provision in British public life for the job of first lady, and no expectation among the public that there should be any such role. Blair's political managers stressed throughout the campaign that the comparisons being drawn between her and her fellow lawyer Hillary Clinton were misleading, since she had no interest in mixing in government and every intention of returning to her job.</p>
        <p>I can remember going to court to observe Cherie Booth Q.C. in the week after the election and expecting to find a sashed-off area for the press. In fact, I was the only reporter there, and no one in the courtroom seemed to take any notice of the fact that the woman in the black silk robe and curly white wig was the wife of the new prime minister, and that her picture had been on the world's front pages just days earlier.</p>
        <p>In her casework she focuses on employee rights and workplace discrimination, while among the charities that she supports with events at 10 Downing Street are groups concerned with domestic violence, child care, breast cancer and children with cancer. She moves about London with minimal fuss, orders salads to go from sandwich bars in the Inns of Court district and often rides public transportation. That came to light last fall when she was stopped by a London underground guard and fined $15 for having an underpaid ticket for her journey.</p>
        <p>She and Blair met in 1976, when they went to work in the law chambers of Derry Irvine, today Britain's lord chancellor. The romance kindling in his office didn't catch Lord Irvine's eye until one evening at a dinner at Luigi's restaurant in Covent Garden. He said he suddenly sensed ''a certain frisson'' between them. ''Having paid the bill,'' he says, ''I pushed off.'' They were married at St. John's, Oxford, Blair's college, in 1980, with Irvine identifying himself in a toast as ''Cupid Q.C.''</p>
        <p>Blair never expressed any interest in a political career as a young man, but classmates of Cherie's say she told them in her convent grammar school that she planned to become Britain's first female prime minister. She pursued her political ambitions in 1983, running for Parliament and losing in a Tory district in southeastern England at the same time that Blair, who had lost in his first try a year earlier, was winning his present seat in an old coal-mining Labor stronghold in the northeastern district of Sedgefield. She ran a more left-wing race than he did, fueling rumors that persist to this day that she harbors the Socialist views that he has so rigorously expunged from the reformed party he now calls New Labor.</p>
        <p>If she does, and it's doubtful, she keeps them to herself except when it involves her own work. Her independence was evident earlier this year when she urged union leaders to sue the Blair government and offered to represent them if they went ahead. Last week, she joined Matrix Chambers, a new legal group concentrating on civil liberties, constitutional law and human rights, a menu that could put her in further legal conflict with the government.</p>
        <p>Her role in government is to accompany Blair at ceremonial and travel events and to say nothing publicly. She is more attractive in person than in pictures, and she has upgraded her formerly lank-haired, professorial image. On foreign trips, she takes a hairdresser and will appear in as many as four different outfits the same day, a big change for a woman who used to dress as if she well knew that she would be spending most of her working day covered by a black silk robe.</p>
        <p>Though she is never interviewed, in one uncharacteristic venture she was guest editor for an issue of the women's magazine Prima during the election campaign. There the public learned of her 30-minute dinner solutions, her warnings about letting the mystery go out of marriage and her assessment of her husband's household skills. (''He's very good at polishing shoes and has been known to cook a meal -- I wouldn't say he is intimate with our washing machine, but he does know where it is.'') That is the last she has been heard from on that kind of subject.</p>
        <p>I ask Blair if, bright and involved as Cherie is, she doesn't give him a hard time every once in a while. ''You probably won't believe this, but the answer is no,'' he says. ''I'm not saying we never discuss politics, because it would be a bit bizarre to say that. Of course we discuss what's going on. She's been fantastic to me, and I wouldn't be in the position I am without her. She's an enormous source of strength and an extraordinary person in her own right. I mean, I never know how she manages with all the different things she does, the work, the family.'' His voice trails off. ''But really, when the door of the flat closes, it's time for the kids. ''</p>
        <p>For Blair's principal aides, weekend leisure comes to an abrupt end on Sunday nights when their home faxes light up with sheets of notes he has made to himself about subjects to be brought up at the start-of-the-week meeting Monday morning at No. 10. ''I always know it has arrived when my husband shouts out, 'Here comes your Sunday night stream of consciousness,' ''Anji Hunter says.</p>
        <p>Stream of consciousness from the famously ordered mind of Tony Blair? ''Oh,'' says Alastair Campbell, his press spokesman, ''maybe it'll say: 'Spain -where are we on this? Foreign policy, AC speaks to me; Northern Ireland, I'm really worried about this, Trimble needs shoring up. Adoption, why does it take six months before a couple gets to know the result of something? Business -- three times last week people were complaining to me about too much regulation. Do we have a grip on this? London mayor, when should I go and do something?''</p>
        <p>Where the last would-be revolutionary in 10 Downing Street, Margaret Thatcher, was thought of as polarizing, Blair calls himself a practitioner of ''inclusive'' politics. He says he aims to create a Britain that is free of the class, economic and racial distinctions that he argues have stood in the way of equal access. ''I'm sort of a one-nation-for-all-the-people politician,'' Blair says, uttering one of the vague and pious-sounding Third Way bromides that make his opponents apoplectic. ''I'm essentially a value-based politician. I don't believe in ideology but in the basic values, the concepts of community and social justice, opportunity and security for all.''</p>
        <p>He describes the overall philosophy as an effort to reconcile the incompatible. His government cuts corporate taxes, Blair says, while establishing Britain's first minimum wage. It puts young people to work and at the same time gets tough with youth crime. It increases social spending while decreasing income taxes. It unites social justice with economic dynamism, ambition with compassion, fairness with enterprise.</p>
        <p>He is the embodiment of some contrary impulses himself. The boyish, tousle-haired leader who arrives jauntily on platforms and peppers his speeches with references to blokes and mates is also known for dagger-in-the-toga ruthlessness in political back rooms.</p>
        <p>He came to power with reforming ideas for British society and global ambitions of how his island nation could fulfill its assigned role of punching above its weight. He has made significant headway in his objectives of moving the United Kingdom away from ideological and classbound politics, energizing the individual parts of it -- Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland -- by yielding some of London's authority over them, liberating British business from restrictions that discourage risk-taking, getting rid of fusty anachronisms like the hereditary peers of the House of Lords, reducing the poor's dependence on the state and turning countrymen famous for their bloody-minded independence into at least grudging Europeans.</p>
        <p>With a depleted Conservative opposition offering no real alternative to his agenda and still smarting from seeing many of its old ideas gussied up in the more alluring apparel of New Labor, critics have had to settle on his style as their target. And they have made modest inroads into his surreal levels of public approval by demonstrating that some of what originally ingratiated now just grates.</p>
        <p>People these days express weariness with his stubbornly upbeat manner, feel manipulated by his regime's tight management of information and find him to be, in the most frequently uttered complaint, a ''control freak.'' Though he has realized his goal of turning his notoriously quarrelsome party into one with a new reputation for competence, a lot of Britons have become bored with the tame and colorless substitute, seeing it as an army of policy-wonk apparatchiks in gray suits and wire-frame glasses robotically reciting the sayings of Chairman Tony.</p>
        <p>In a land known for its eccentrics, Blair is studiously normal, a rational and industrious professional with prim habits and unshakable self-control. He is the kind of person, an acquaintance once said, who might press his jeans.</p>
        <p>His sense of certainty and iron discipline may have gained him the admiration of a majority of the 60 million Britons, but it hasn't won him their affection. In a land justly famous for treating earnestness with irony, Blair is all business, often beginning sentences with a cut-the-nonsense ''Look'' and then moving into a corporate-retreat inspirational rhetoric that a lot of people find simply sanctimonious. Private Eye, the satirical magazine, calls him Vicar Blair of St. Albion Parish. The enormous appeal of a Blair nemesis, the populist Labor maverick Ken Livingstone, who on May 4 won the first election for mayor of London, was widely attributed to people's impatience with their carefully stage-managed government.</p>
        <p>With 13 highly competitive national newspapers selling a total of more than 14 million copies a day, Britain subjects its politicians to intense scrutiny. ''We don't have a great constituency in the media these days,'' Blair says. ''There is a tendency for the right to attack us because we are Labor and the left to attack us because we are New Labor.''</p>
        <p>The press is largely hostile to Britain's becoming more active in European politics, a campaign that Blair is pushing forcefully if delicately because the country is not participating in the continent's major undertaking, adoption of the euro as its common currency. Blair was hailed in papers across the continent as the hero of a March summit meeting in Lisbon that ended up praising his ideas for economic restructuring. But his success went largely unrecorded in Britain, where the front pages concentrated on the fact that he and his principal ministers used three separate government airplanes to get to Portugal.</p>
        <p>The current general whine in Britain may be nothing more than a necessary correction on the national tolerance-of-triumphalism meter. ''Tony Blair has been so successful for sufficiently long,'' says Sin Simon, a political writer sympathetic to him, ''that there is now a part of every Briton, including most of his closest friends and allies, that would like to see him humiliated and broken.''</p>
        <p>The man I find in his study at 10 Downing Street appears in no mood to accommodate them. ''Look, ''Blair says, ''it was inevitable that this was going to happen. I mean, I used to think sometimes in that first year, For goodness' sake, let's get back into normal politics again.''</p>
        <p>A lot of the incomings at the official residence are being launched from the traditional forces in his party who believe that New Labor ought to be more generous with state aid to the poor and needy, that Blair is selling out the party's principles. Blair doesn't duck. ''If I went back to the old tunes of the left, I would immediately get a whole lot of support from certain groups of people,'' he says. ''I mean, it would be daft because it wouldn't be what the country needed, but people could locate me. You know, I think one of the problems is that I am totally grounded to what I believe in, and I have complete confidence in it too. But it isn't the same grounding as traditional right and left categories, and so people go around saying I am not grounded.''</p>
        <p>But can't you express this confidence without making so many people think you're a control freak? ''Look, this is the classic political trick of turning a strength into a weakness,'' he says. ''People like me who grew up with the Labor Party remember what they said about us during our 18 years in opposition -- that we were undisciplined, we had no leadership, we were a bunch of pressure groups and left-wing groups, the party conferences every year were bun fights, you'd have revolutions coming from the conference chairs and total chaos and at the end of the week the media would say, 'That's been a really interesting conference,' and the public would vote with their feet and disappear.</p>
        <p>''Yes, we changed all that, but I'm very pleased to have changed all that and I'm not going to allow people to turn what is a strength into a weakness. People talk about me being a control freak. I have decentralized more power than any prime minister in 100 years, but within the Labor Party I will continue to keep a tight grip.''</p>
        <p>Anji hunter and Blair first knew each other in Edinburgh, where she lived and he went to Fettes, an elite boarding school that is sometimes called Eton with a kilt. She went to work for him in Parliament in 1986 and today is his personal gatekeeper, one of the two aides who, it is said, can walk into Blair's office without knocking.</p>
        <p>The other is Alastair Campbell, a former tabloid political writer who has turned the job of press spokesman into one of the most powerful policy positions in the government. He bullies reporters and their editors, shapes the presentation of government initiatives and assures that all public information goes through the Downing Street sieve, keeping out of circulation any items that don't bear fine on-message contours.</p>
        <p>The three of us talked one afternoon in Campbell's spacious office with a bellying window that conveniently looks out on the Downing Street cul-de-sac that everyone going in or out of No. 10 must pass through. The subject was Blair's fabled ''ruthlessness,'' a part of his character that is never on public display but proved necessary during the years he was recasting the Labor Party and comes in for use now when major cabinet personnel decisions arise.</p>
        <p>Neither of them quarrels with the word being applied to their boss. ''It's not something he likes to call upon, not something that is natural to him,'' Hunter says. Campbell says: ''He knows he must do it, and he tries to be tactful. I think he spends a lot of time before a reshuffle not so much steeling himself as kind of thinking it through and being absolutely sure he is being fair and doing the right thing. I've been with him when he has sacked people, and he even has a sort of charming way of doing it, being aware of the impact he's having. But then, you know -- I wouldn't necessarily want to see this in print with my name to it -- once he's out of the room, he's on to the next thing.''</p>
        <p>Lord Falconer says: ''He has an unaggressive personality, and it misleads people into believing he doesn't have the sort of drive he does. Actually Kosovo was an example of his ruthlessness but not in the sense of his trampling over people but in his utter single-mindedness, exclusive of everything else going on.''</p>
        <p>He mentions an incident from their bachelor years together in South London. ''I remember waking up in the middle of the night, and there he was fully dressed, apparently about to go to work at 3 in the morning. I said, 'What on earth are you doing?' and he said, 'I'm going to work.' He was so absorbed in a particular case that he had absolutely no idea whether it was the middle of the night or the middle of the morning.</p>
        <p>''That,'' he says, ''was the same man you saw get so totally involved in Kosovo.''</p>
        <p>Twilight settles unnoticed over Scottish towns like Kilsyth where the northern sky can get dusky by midday. Tendrils of gray smoke curl up into the evening murk from the chimneys of brick houses that march up hillsides in tidy rows. Puddles dot the town's streets and sidewalks, and mist rises off the Campsie Fells and the Fannyside Lochs just beyond the town's borders. This is the Britain far removed from Big Ben and 10 Downing Street.</p>
        <p>Blair has come to a town meeting this March night to pit his personal appeal against the gathering individual annoyances with his government, and milling about the auditorium is the kind of crowd to test his ability to practice his inclusive politics. There are men in smart tweed sport coats and dark suits, and others in crumpled wool flat hats and farm overalls. Young women who look as if they've just reached voting age show up in black tights and leather jackets and mix with other women in print dresses and with touches of blue and lavender in their white hair.</p>
        <p>Flashbulbs pop in the audience as Blair bounds into the hall, waving and beaming his sunburst smile. He strides purposefully toward the stage, his slightly pigeon-toed walk adding a touch of youthfulness to his appearance. Once he's onstage, he sheds his suit jacket and hangs it on the back of a fold-up chair. He tamps down the applause with outstretched hands and sets out on the mission of presenting himself to the crowd as different from the humorless control freak in London they might have read about.</p>
        <p>''Now, people can ask whatever they like,'' he says, then casts darting, fearful looks around the room. ''Well, more or less,'' he adds. People laugh. A little self-deprecation has just gone a long way.</p>
        <p>He says he knows they've heard him talk about how Britain has to modernize, get in sync with globalization, become comfortable in front of a keyboard. Scary stuff, his expression is saying, but then he tells a story that seeks to reassure.</p>
        <p>''You know, I'm just getting accustomed to this myself,'' he says. ''Cherie's brilliant at it, and the kids are good. But I'm taking an online course in Durham. And this bloke is sitting next to me in class, and we're putting down our answers, and I can see that he looks a little uncomfortable. So I say, 'Look, I know you must be feeling nervous because you're sitting next to me, but relax, I'm just a normal guy like you.' And he says: 'No, that's not why I'm feeling uncomfortable. It's that on every test, I'm getting the right answers and you're getting the wrong ones, and I'm long-term unemployed and you're the bloody prime minister.''</p>
        <p>Blair is good at appealing to groups like this, but the encounters have become more trying now that he has been in office for three years and can't put all the blame on the last Tory government. Blair's stirring rhetoric on Kosovo and his White House toasts to the special relationship with Washington mean little in Kilsyth. Here everyone has had an experience they feel he's now responsible for, and the questions track their disappointments. They've been kept waiting too long for an appointment with the National Health Service, fares are going up on their trains and service is more crowded and less punctual, cheap agricultural imports are driving out local farmers, schools aren't offering adult education, the strong pound is hurting business.</p>
        <p>It's an awkward spot for Blair, a restless man who frequently proclaims impatience with the status quo and pledges ''radical'' solutions. To get his footing, he prepares the ground. ''You're going to hear the phrase 'It takes time' a lot tonight, you'll probably hear me say it many times. But in fact it does take time.'' An hour later after he has given various versions of his standard response about the ineffectiveness of old-fashioned, short-term fixes and the need for structural change, he has made the saying the shared wisdom of the room. ''I told you,'' he says with a conspiratorial smile, ''I told you this phrase would become tedious after a while.''</p>
        <p>In our conversation at Downing Street, Blair protests portrayals of him as a man feeling beaten down by criticisms even as he moves toward the acclamation of almost certain re-election a year from now. ''I am not dispirited, but you do have to keep driving the argument forward,'' he says. ''The fact that our opponents have to coalesce around this notion of 'Well, they're arrogant' or 'Let's make the country cynical about them' is because they don't have a big argument. If they were saying, 'You're destroying the British economy' or 'Look, you're running the country wrongly, you're taking it in the wrong direction, and here are the reasons,' but they're not.''</p>
        <p>Blair wants to be thought of as more than just a Labor leader who has overcome the party's reputation for chaotic management or a prime minister who used his power to become a competent custodian of the country. He is fond of calling his government ''a project,'' implying not just a rearrangement of British politics but its permanent restructuring.</p>
        <p>''I would say that we are winning the intellectual argument in Britain,'' he says. ''I don't see any serious alternative. And I think if you look around the world, most successful governments are moving more or less in the same direction. It is that there is a role for government and for community today, but it is an empowering role, an equipping role. It's not old, big-style government imposing top-down, heavy-handed intervention. And it's making sure that it's not an exclusive but an inclusive type of political society that you've created.''</p>
        <p>The project envisions Blair himself and successors from Labor running Britain for many years to come. Labor has never held power for two consecutive full terms, and Blair talks of this history as the party's shame. A principal goal is to make Labor the party of government that the Conservatives were in the last century, to make Blair's brand of inclusive social democratic politics the one that most Britons identify with.</p>
        <p>The project is cast in conceptual terms -- the dominant force in Britain in the next century should be the broad progressive one that ruled in Victorian times but then split when Labor was created in 1900 to agitate for the newly politicized working class. But the success of the project is cast in personal terms. It depends upon Blair, the leader who may strike some people as smug and controlling but who wants you to believe that while he has grand ambitions for his country and no reluctance to be authoritarian in pursuing them, he is just a regular bloke with a working wife, trying to keep up at the office and rear a normal family.</p>
        <p>I ask Blair if, three years after starting it, he can keep the project on the rise even without the public exuberance that helped send it aloft. ''All governments in the end never satisfy everybody's expectations,'' Blair says. ''But you've got to ask yourself: 'Are we moving the country in the right direction? Are we modernizing the country in the face of massive change and trying to do it so that the benefits of change reach all the people? Are we basically delivering on the things that we came into politics to deliver?' I would say that I can answer those questions with a fairly comfortable yes.''</p>
