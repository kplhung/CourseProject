        <p>Alfred Spurlock, shot in the head by the police during a burglary and in jail most of his life, did not know he was H.I.V. positive until after he wandered drunk on railroad tracks in New Jersey and got clobbered by a train that knocked him into a pond.</p>
        <p>That could be the first sentence of an exceptionally depressing hard-luck story.</p>
        <p>This is anything but.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spurlock is one of a group of formerly luckless people, all poor and infected with the virus that causes AIDS, who in the past year have hung out on a balcony in the Bowery and witnessed the coming of a paradise that replaced a parking lot.</p>
        <p>It's a garden center where Billy Holiday sings over loudspeakers for young professionals who are hunting potted plants. Weeping Japanese maples sell for $600. Hoes that Wal-Mart sells for $14.96 sell in the former parking lot for $29.95.</p>
        <p>The Chelsea Garden Center, then, is exactly the kind of place that Mr. Spurlock and his fellow clients at the Bowery Residents' Committee Adult Day Health Center would not be able to enjoy unless fate had offered them a perch that looks down upon, among other things, yuppies buying mulch.</p>
        <p>''You see people in there you don't even know existed,'' said Eduvige Rosario, 39, who was told he had the AIDS virus 15 years ago. ''It is like seeing monkeys in the zoo.''</p>
        <p>It's the greenery, more than the credit-card-carrying humanity, that brings pleasure to the men and women who sit on a warm spring afternoon, smoking cigarettes and gazing at a Thundercloud Purple Leaf Plum tree (the tallest item in the garden store) swaying in the breeze.</p>
        <p>''I can say without a doubt that the attitude of our clients has changed since Central Park moved into the parking lot,'' said Josephine Gilliam, a substance-abuse counselor at the center. ''They are more friendly, more open and they started to rally around each other.''</p>
        <p>That's no exaggeration at all, says Ms. Gilliam, who herself sits and smokes on the second-story porch between counseling sessions and admires the Thundercloud Purple Leaf Plum.</p>
        <p>''I watch it blow in the wind, and my stress goes away,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Stress usually goes up, not away, when businesses that cater to the affluent rub shoulders on the Bowery with agencies that serve the poor, the sick and the previously incarcerated. A dot-com invasion has sent rents climbing in the neighborhood. Cheap housing, even cheap bad housing, is increasingly scarce on the formerly infamous skid row where fancy restaurants now sell grilled paillard of veal for $18 a plate.</p>
        <p>But the adult care center at 317 Bowery is lucky. Four years ago, just ahead of the dot-com curve, the center signed a lease that guarantees 50 years of affordable rent, according to John Sheehan, acting director of the center, which is financed by its clients' Medicaid benefits.</p>
        <p>Chelsea Garden Center, too, has had an atypical stress reaction. Its owner, David Protell, moved last summer to the corner of Bowery and Second Street not knowing who his neighbors would be and certainly not anticipating that they would hang out on a reviewing stand, eyeballing his customers and loving his shrubs.</p>
        <p>''I had concerns about the neighborhood for all the obvious reasons,'' said Mr. Protell, who was forced to move from Chelsea to make room for an apartment building.</p>
        <p>''But these people up there,'' he said, casting his eyes in the direction of the smokers on the balcony, ''are excellent neighbors. I am sure we amuse them. We are the animals in the zoo.''</p>
        <p>The Chelsea Garden Center has given a Christmas tree and some plants to the day care center. Mr. Protell said he might be interested in offering jobs, too, but that he has not yet been asked.</p>
        <p>And what of Mr. Spurlock, the man who got knocked into the pond by the train only to learn from doctors who put him back together that he was infected with H.I.V.?</p>
        <p>He has healed up and, he said, he has been clean of drugs and drink since July of last year -- about the time the Chelsea Garden Center moved in next door. Mr. Spurlock does not believe coincidence is causality, but he loves looking at the greenery. He describes its arrival as ''the best thing that could have happened.''</p>
        <p>One doleful concern of Mr. Spurlock and all his fellow clients is the long wooden shrubbery planters that they see stacked on the roof of the garden center's office. On the edge of a parking-lot paradise, the planters look like coffins.</p>
