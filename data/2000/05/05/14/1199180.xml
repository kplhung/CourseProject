        <p>Susan Merrell's first novel, A MEMBER OF THE FAMILY (HarperCollins, $25), is a heartbreaking story about an adoption gone very wrong; more generally, it's about the limits of familial love. Chris and Deborah Latham, a clean-cut, all-American couple living in Sag Harbor, N.Y. -- he's a dentist, she's a part-time photographer -- decide to adopt a young Romanian orphan rather than have a second child on their own. Their new son, whom they call Michael, is bright and attractive and affectionate. He's also severely emotionally disturbed. The Lathams try everything from traditional psychology to homeopathy, from indulgence to tough love, in an attempt to give Michael a normal future. Michael has several terrifyingly violent episodes, alienates his friends and is thrown out of school for disruptive behavior. A child psychiatrist (who ''had been picking through human wreckage for years, and . . . knew the difference between detritus and the seeds of possibility'') reads a scan of Michael's brain and informs his parents that ''betting on Michael's chances for becoming a functioning citizen . . . was akin to buying fool's gold.'' But not until someone outside the family draws their attention to the damage Michael is doing to his sister, Caroline, and by extension to them, do the Lathams begin to think about the tough decisions that lie before them. Interwoven into the family drama is a subplot involving Chris, himself orphaned as a child, who has a big secret in his past. Though the attempt to link Chris's past with his current travails is less than successful, ''A Member of the Family'' is a nuanced exploration of what it means to be just that.</p>
