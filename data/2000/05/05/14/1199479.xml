        <p>TWO titans of index investing are getting ready to rumble.</p>
        <p>For more than two decades, Barclays Global Investors and the Vanguard Group, which each manage hundreds of billions of dollars, have operated in mostly distinct fiefs. Barclays, a subsidiary of Barclays P.L.C. of London, manages index funds that try to mimic various stock gauges, predominantly for institutional clients. Vanguard, of Malvern, Pa., is the world's leading manager of index funds for individual investors.</p>
        <p>Last week, the two appeared poised to fight a price war squarely on Vanguard's turf.</p>
        <p>For months, Barclays has been preparing to invade Vanguard's retail empire with a group of index funds that trade like stocks. A few of these exchange-traded funds are already offered by the American Stock Exchange and have struck a chord with investors because they are generally cheaper than traditional mutual funds and can be bought and sold throughout the day.</p>
        <p>Barclays, which manages $624 billion in index funds, expects to start 47 of these exchange-traded funds beginning this week. The funds will track indexes as popular as the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index and as obscure, for domestic investors, as a South Korean market index.</p>
        <p>Despite previously questioning how exchange-traded funds will perform in volatile situations, Vanguard executives said on Friday that the company planned to offer five such funds. The new Vanguard exchange-traded funds will track the same indexes as some of its largest traditional domestic index funds, including the S.&amp; P. 500.</p>
        <p>Vanguard plans to let current fund investors transfer money, at no cost, from their traditional mutual funds into the new products.</p>
        <p>Vanguard officials say the move is unrelated to the Barclays plan or to competition from other exchange-traded funds.</p>
        <p>''We continue to think traditional mutual funds will attract most of the cash flow,'' said George U. Sauter, who runs Vanguard's $225 billion indexing division.</p>
        <p>Vanguard has been studying the idea of an exchange-traded fund for 15 years, Mr. Sauter said, and is acting now to shield the long-term investors in its traditional index funds by giving more active traders an alternative.</p>
        <p>A Barclays official took issue with Mr. Sauter's explanation.</p>
        <p>''Vanguard's move is clearly a reaction and a validation of the exchange-traded fund concept,'' said Thomas L. Taggart, a Barclays Global Investors spokesman.</p>
        <p>Exchange-traded funds have become popular over the last couple of years on the American Stock Exchange. Its SPDR's fund, whose shares are known as spiders, tracks the S.&amp; P. 500 and is second in volume on the Amex only to another exchange-traded fund, which tracks the Nasdaq 100 index.</p>
        <p>While the annual expenses charged by spiders are less than those charged by Vanguard's flagship S.&amp; P. 500 index fund, a commission is charged when investors buy or sell shares in exchange-traded funds, as with regular stock trades.</p>
        <p>And unlike traditional mutual funds, which are priced after the market closes, exchange-traded funds trade throughout the day. Vanguard has not set the fees for its new funds.</p>
        <p>The entrance of the new Barclays funds has added a potent threat to Vanguard. Adapting to the new products is a ''huge fundamental shift'' for Vanguard, which has until now required its investors to buy its index funds by mail, said Daniel P. Wiener, an editor of a newsletter that tracks Vanguard funds.</p>
        <p>''In the new economy, having to use the Postal Service is decidedly old fashioned,'' Mr. Wiener said. ''Barclays not only came at the gates of Vanguard's castle, they came right over the parapets.''</p>
