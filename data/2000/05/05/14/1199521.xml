        <p>The last time the Supreme Court ruled that Congress had unconstitutionally given away too much of its lawmaking authority to the executive branch, a majority of the justices who sit on the court today had not even been born.</p>
        <p>That was in 1935, and since then, the doctrine of ''nondelegation,'' which the court invoked to strike down part of a major New Deal program, the National Industrial Recovery Act, has appeared little more than a historical footnote. It lingered as a quaint reminder of a formalistic approach to the constitutional separation of powers, even as the modern administrative state, with powerful regulatory agencies engaging in what often looks very much like lawmaking, grew up around it.</p>
        <p>But while it disappeared from public view, the nondelegation doctrine has not lacked for friends in high places: academics, lawyers for regulated industries, as well as the occasional judge, who found a disturbing lack of political accountability in Congress's penchant for shifting important policy choices to administrative agencies.</p>
        <p>Now, after 65 years, the issue has cycled back to the Supreme Court. The court will announce, perhaps as early as Monday, whether it will hear an appeal from a ruling last year that invalidated two clean air standards issued in 1997 by the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>While the decision last May by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit concerned an important issue of environmental law, what set off shock waves was not so much the actual ruling as its rationale: that the Clean Air Act, as interpreted by the agency, ''effects an unconstitutional delegation of legislative power.''</p>
        <p>After failing to persuade the full appeals court last fall to reconsider the panel's 2-to-1 decision, the Clinton administration, calling the case one of ''extraordinary governmental concern,'' filed a Supreme Court appeal in January. So did Massachusetts and New Jersey, along with the American Lung Association, which had participated at the appeals court level to defend the new clean air standards.</p>
        <p>The coalition of industry groups that successfully challenged the standards, including the American Trucking Associations, the United States Chamber of Commerce and the American Farm Bureau Federation, is also urging the justices to accept the case, for the purpose of affirming the decision that the new standards are invalid. The coalition, in fact, wants the court to broaden the scope of the case and decide for the first time whether the Clean Air Act requires the Environmental Protection Agency, in setting national standards, to engage in some form of cost-benefit analysis.</p>
        <p>The industry coalition argues that by reading a cost-benefit requirement into the statute, the justices would be providing the ''intelligible principles'' that the appeals court found lacking and would thus be able to avoid the whole sticky nondelegation issue. Whether the justices will find industry's invitation attractive is highly uncertain.</p>
        <p>But virtually everyone familiar with the case, Browner v. American Trucking Associations, No. 99-1257, assumes that the court will grant at least the federal government's petition and decide, in its next term, whether the nondelegation doctrine merits the new lease on life the appeals court gave it in what Solicitor General Seth P. Waxman's petition for the government calls a ''radical departure from settled law.''</p>
        <p>The implications are enormous. ''It's the basic challenge to the administrative state,'' Prof. Richard J. Lazarus, an expert in administrative and environmental law at Georgetown University Law Center, said in a recent interview. ''A huge amount of regulated activity depends on it.''</p>
        <p>The Clean Air Act is hardly unique in the amount of administrative discretion it leaves in the hands of the agency; if this law is unconstitutional on the basis of excessive delegation, then so, plausibly, are many others, from the Communications Act of 1934, which authorized the Federal Communications Commission to regulate broadcasting in light of ''public interest, convenience, and necessity,'' to the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, which established and placed in the judicial branch a commission charged with establishing the range of sentences for every federal offense, an almost quintessentially legislative power.</p>
        <p>These delegations and countless others -- with the exception of two New Deal-era initiatives struck down in 1935 -- have been upheld by the Supreme Court under a test established in a 1928 opinion by Chief Justice William Howard Taft. Under that test, a delegation of legislative authority will be upheld as long as Congress ''shall lay down by legislative act an intelligible principle'' to which the agency ''is directed to conform.''</p>
        <p>That is what Judges Stephen F. Williams and Douglas H. Ginsburg, over the dissent of Judge David S. Tatel, found lacking in the Clean Air Act. The law directs the Environmental Protection Agency to set national air quality standards at levels that ''in the judgment of the administrator'' and ''allowing an adequate margin of safety'' are ''requisite to protect the public health.''</p>
        <p>The appeals court majority said that for pollutants like those at issue in the case, ozone and fine airborne particles, for which there is no level above zero that does not pose a health risk, the agency lacked ''any determinate criterion for drawing lines'' and had ''no intelligible principle by which to identify a stopping point.'' The agency's unconfined discretion ''leaves it free to pick any point between zero and a hair below the concentrations yielding London's Killer Fog,'' the decision said, referring to the 4,000 deaths that occurred in a weeklong pollution crisis in 1952.</p>
        <p>Both Judge Tatel's dissenting opinion and the various Supreme Court appeals assert that the agency's process for setting its new standards, based on dozens of studies as well as review by an independent scientific advisory panel, bore no relationship to the casual and high-handed approach portrayed by the appeals court majority. Supporters of broad agency discretion often argue that Congress cannot possibly make the fine-tuned scientific judgments necessary to keep modern regulatory programs up to date, a point that Congress recognized in the Clean Air Act by instructing the E.P.A. to review national air quality standards every five years.</p>
        <p>In any event, the government petition notes, agency regulations are always subject to being set aside as ''arbitrary and capricious,'' a well-known administrative law concept that serves adequately as a judicial brake on agency behavior without calling the entire regulatory structure into question.</p>
        <p>But the appeals court majority clearly had a more expansive game plan than setting aside a regulation or two. In a 1995 essay in the magazine Regulation, published by the libertarian Cato Institute, Judge Ginsburg offered a paean to the nondelegation doctrine, which he said had existed, along with other concepts repudiated as the Supreme Court acquiesced in the New Deal vision of a strong national government, for 60 years ''only as part of the Constitution-in-exile.'' He wrote:</p>
        <p>''The memory of these ancient exiles, banished for standing in opposition to unlimited government, is kept alive by a few scholars who labor on in the hope of a restoration, a second coming of the Constitution of liberty -- even if perhaps not in their own lifetimes.''</p>
        <p>Whatever the eventual fate of the Clear Air Act case, Judge Ginsburg's words sound decidedly less out of context today than they did even five years ago, just before the court began issuing a series of decisions reviving a limited vision of federal power. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist has written many of those opinions, and if the nondelegation doctrine resonates for any member of the court, it does so for him. Twenty years ago, as an associate justice, Mr. Rehnquist was a solitary voice in any earlier regulatory case when he wrote, ''We ought not to shy away from our judicial duty to invalidate unconstitutional delegations of legislative authority solely out of concern that we should thereby reinvigorate discredited constitutional doctrines of the pre-New Deal era.''</p>
