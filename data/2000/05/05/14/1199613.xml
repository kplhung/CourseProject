        <p>Lt. Gen. Claudia J. Kennedy, the Army's top female officer, won an early round in her sexual harassment case when the Army's inspector general concluded that she had been the victim of sexual harassment four years ago. At least two reviews are needed before a final decision by the Vice Chief of the Army. General Kennedy charged that Brig. Gen. Larry G. Smith accosted her in her Pentagon office after a routine briefing. It is the first time one general has accused another of sexual harassment.</p>
