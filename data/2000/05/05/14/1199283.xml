        <p>FOR 27 years, Rabbi Amiel Wohl has presided over countless milestones in the lives of his congregants at Temple Israel, a reform synagogue here. He has officiated at circumcisions, at bar and bat mitzvahs, at weddings and funerals.</p>
        <p>Last weekend, he marked a turning point of his own: the transition at age 70, from senior rabbi to rabbi emeritus.</p>
        <p>The event was celebrated by 1,000 people at a special service at the temple Friday night, and on Saturday night a havdalah service and dinner party.</p>
        <p>''I know that they're putting me on a shelf,'' a grinning Rabbi Wohl told the partygoers in his trademark Midwestern drawl. ''I know this is a nice way of doing it.</p>
        <p>''People keep asking me what I'm going to do. They're worried about what I'm going to do. I'm worried about it too. But I'm sure I'll find something. This has been an adventure of faith. I still have so many ideas and aspirations for the Jewish people. I'm not going to rest on my imagined laurels.''</p>
        <p>Rabbi Wohl defies the stereotypes of those in his calling; he never takes a holier-than-thou approach. He was born and raised in Cincinnati and has a lively sense of humor and a love of country music: during Saturday night's cocktail hour, he quoted Ernest Tubb's songs to a nephew from Nashville.</p>
        <p>Besides serving his congregants, Rabbi Wohl is perhaps best known for his work to bring about racial harmony.</p>
        <p>In 1979, for example, relations between Jews and blacks were at a nadir of sorts, nationally and in New Rochelle.</p>
        <p>Andrew Young, who was President Jimmy Carter's ambassador to the United Nations, had held a secret meeting with the Palestine Liberation Organization. Jews protested. Mr. Young was relieved of his post and many blacks, in turn, held protests of their own, blaming Jewish voters.</p>
        <p>To deal with the resulting tensions, Rabbi Wohl met with the Rev. Vernon Shannon, then pastor of St. Catherine A.M.E. Zion Church in New Rochelle. Together they formed the Coalition for Mutual Respect, an amalgam of Jews and blacks, which is still going strong today.</p>
        <p>''The trick is, you create friendly interaction, you relate to people as individuals on a social level, first, before tackling big, abstract questions,'' Rabbi Wohl said. ''The coalition held covered-dish suppers, theater parties, shared worship services, including a very popular interfaith Passover Seder -- we did things that were enjoyable. We -- African-Americans and Jews -- formed friendships that were quite natural. Then we could sit down and discuss difficult issues, after we had shared enjoyable activities.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, if there was an operative exhortation at Saturday night's festivities, it could have been ''enjoy.''</p>
        <p>The havdalah is a short, quiet ceremony to close the Sabbath with prayer, fragrant spices, to remind one of the holy day's sweetness, and a special braided, multi-wicked candle, symbolic of the intertwining of knowledge. This havdalah service had all that, and also included the Harold Seletsky Klezmer Trio.</p>
        <p>These men on drums, accordion and clarinet played the traditional folk music of Eastern European Jews, lilting and lively with a hint of melancholy behind the syncopation.</p>
        <p>Then it was time to leave the vast, contemporary sanctuary and move to an equally large room for cocktails and hors d'oeuvres. As they nibbled on potato pancakes with caviar and skewered Middle Eastern-style lamb, people spoke of the rabbi's legacy.</p>
        <p>''Rabbi Wohl translates spirituality into human dialogue,'' said Lois T. Bronz, vice chairwoman of the county's Board of Legislators and the legislator from the Eighth District, which includes parts of New Rochelle. She added that his interest in race relations has personal resonance for her: she is black and her husband, Charles, a fitness consultant, is white and Jewish.</p>
        <p>Also on hand were members of the rabbi's family. His 40-year-old son, Dewey, had traveled from Malibu, Calif., where he owns seven mail-order companies on the Internet.</p>
        <p>''He was very cool when I was growing up,'' he said. ''If I got into trouble, he was always there. He is a wonderful person.''</p>
        <p>Between courses during the dinner, everyone saw a short film about the rabbi's life, beginning with his childhood in Cincinnati as the son of a well-known rabbi, his service early in his career in a small congregation in Waco, Tex., and his later meetings with local and world leaders. In one scene, he reminisces laughingly about meeting President Carter. ''Here he is, asking about Jewish voters, and as I'm talking, he's actually taking notes on what I'm saying. It was like a dream.''</p>
