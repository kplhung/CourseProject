        <p>At least the Capulets and Montagues didn't have to share a name. Not so the descendants of a 19th-century Neapolitan who opened an Italian deli on Ninth Avenue 107 years ago. In high fairy-tale tradition, the business eventually passed to descendants: four brothers named Dell'Orto who, citing differences in management style, divided it up between the oldest and youngest pairs.</p>
        <p>That was in 1961, and family relations were never the same.</p>
        <p>Salvatore and Vincent, the older brothers, took over the original store, Manganaro's Grosseria Italiano, a prosperous business that sold groceries and had a small sandwich counter in the back. James and Mario, the younger brothers, got the business next door, a budding sandwich shop called Manganaro's Hero Boy. Both businesses were given the right to use the Manganaro name, but relations between them quickly soured. By the early 1960's the two sides had stopped speaking, and since then a trail of litigation has kept the feud alive.</p>
        <p>These days, the owners express their rancor through telephone directory one-upmanship. Together the stores have two phone numbers but 10 listings under variations of the Manganaro name -- and, in the Grosseria's case, through signs. ''Hero Boy is Not Affiliated with Us! --  Manganaro Foods,'' read placards inside and outside the old-style deli at No. 488, between 37th and 38th Streets.</p>
        <p>James objects to the signs. ''They're saying I'm not a Manganaro,'' he said, sitting behind the counter in the spacious, white-tiled establishment at Nos. 492 and 494 that he runs with his three sons. ''I have just as much right as they do. We both got the name from the patriarchs in the family.''</p>
        <p>The stores locked horns in court in the 1980's, when Hero Boy sued the Grosseria for establishing a telephone line called ''Manganaro's Hero Party Hotline'' that sold six-foot and party hero sandwiches.</p>
        <p>''By doing that, he bummed into my business,'' said James, asserting that in the 1960's and 1970's he spent considerable sums to promote his six-foot heroes, a sandwich he says Salvatore had hardly dabbled with until the 1980's.</p>
        <p>But Salvatore strongly disagrees.  In fact, he said, ''We originated the six-foot sandwich.''</p>
        <p>The court fights, which also focus on use of the Manganaro name and other issues, continue today.</p>
        <p>One of James's sons, Anthony Dell'Orto, says he can't recall ever speaking to Salvatore's daughters, though they grew up side by side.</p>
        <p>''In pictures of my christening, some of my cousins are there and I don't even know who they are,'' he said, looking down the few feet of sidewalk toward his uncle's store. Has he ever said hi to them? ''No, not really,'' he said, shrugging.</p>
