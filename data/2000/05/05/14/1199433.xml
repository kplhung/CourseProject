        <p>The sun was still setting in the window of Sardi's. A couple of cabbies cruised the empty dusk of 46th Street. And the suburban burghers hadn't yet filled the saloons of Broadway with their pretheater gas-baggery. In other words, it was a perfect time for a stagehand to sneak in a quick one before the curtain rises.</p>
        <p>Ed Martone put his feet on the rail, glancing nervously at the clock as he called for a long-necked Bud. '' 'Zat the right time, pal?'' he snapped at the bartender, already three sips into a six-sip beer. ''I mean, is it accurate? I've got an early cue tonight.''</p>

        <p>The sun was still setting in the window of Sardi's. A couple of cabbies cruised the empty dusk of 46th Street. And the suburban burghers hadn't yet filled the saloons of Broadway with their pretheater gas-baggery. In other words, it was a perfect time for a stagehand to sneak in a quick one before the curtain rises.</p>
        <p>Ed Martone put his feet on the rail, glancing nervously at the clock as he called for a long-necked Bud. '' 'Zat the right time, pal?'' he snapped at the bartender, already three sips into a six-sip beer. ''I mean, is it accurate? I've got an early cue tonight.''</p>
        <p>T. J. Keane's, on Eighth Avenue in the heart of the theater district, is a bare stage of a bar that provides the essentials -- drafts of Guinness, polished wood and a stool-side menu heavy on beef -- in a fashion that draws both the patrons of the Great White Way and the sturdy, quick-drinking fellows behind the scenes who make it all work. It is a simple Irish pub surrounded by Irish pubs so similar that it is easy to picture a regular patron swerving at least once through the wrong door.</p>
        <p>What sets T. J.'s apart from its neighbors, though, is the number of International Alliance of Stagehand and Theatrical Employees members who drink there before, and sometimes during, their shows.  For a fly-reel hand with 46 minutes between cues, a cold draft just a couple of hundred yards away is tough to resist.</p>
        <p>''Technically, I'm working right now doing set-up,'' said Manny, the scruffy, bottom-heavy elevator man at the Eugene O'Neill, who preferred that his surname be buried in the annals of thespian lore. ''But as long as I'm back for the curtain at 8, the show goes on.''</p>
        <p>A stagehand's lot has gotten somewhat rougher in the last few years, as automated winches and fancy computer boards have pushed out tired muscles and calloused palms in some of Broadway's biggest theaters. ''That's show business for you, squeezing the little guy,'' says a shrugging Manny, slurping his rum and Coke.</p>
        <p>A consolation for the grunts who do hold jobs is that the union pay is more than enough to keep your bar tab open. Ed Martone owns a house in the Bahamas and a home in Brewster, N.Y., shares an apartment on 14th Street, drives an '88 Corvette convertible and is saving for a brand-new Harley-Davidson. His base pay is $42 an hour, double time on Sundays and double double time if he works through Sunday lunch.</p>
        <p>''But who do you think is busting their hump to make that kind of dough?'' he asks, poking a finger the size of a hot dog at his own chest. ''You got guys out there making more than that pushing papers around a desk. I put in 90 hours last week.''</p>
        <p>Which leaves little time for sitting at the bar; at least, off the clock. Thankfully, Ed's cues are conducive to drinking. In his current show, ''Uncle Vanya'' at the Brooks Atkinson Theater, the first cue comes at curtain. The second is 21 minutes later. Then 41. Then 28. Then 38.</p>
        <p>With the curtain looming, Ed tilts his bottle, his Adam's apple glugging, until the liquid is gone. Then he leaves three singles on the oak for the barman, Roger, and scoots out the door.</p>
        <p>''Guy must have a cue,'' says the man passing through beside him, another stagehand named Peter Wright. ''Me? I don't have jack for at least another hour.''</p>
        <p>''Let's go, Roge,'' he says. ''Gimme a beer.''</p>
