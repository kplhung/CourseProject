        <p>CAR CAMPING</p>
        <p>The Book of Desert Adventures.</p>
        <p>By Mark Sundeen.</p>
        <p>Illustrated by Erik R. Bluhm.</p>

        <p>Quill/HarperCollins Publishers.</p>

        <p>MARK SUNDEEN'S first book could provide a valuable service for young slackers. In fact, for anyone who's overly fond of Kerouac's ''On the Road'' and toying with the idea of taking off on an aimless cross-country drive, ''Car Camping'' might well be the perfect antidote.</p>
        <p>There is little adventure -- and little romance -- in Sundeen's ''desert adventures,'' and the scenery he describes best in these wide-open spaces consists largely of trailer parks, junkyards, campgrounds and ''recreational areas.'' Here there are no larger-than-life characters, no sinner-saints or inspired madmen -- just listless, marginal dreamers, scavengers who seem to have become deluded by some long-forgotten notion of the desert, only to find themselves eking out a hardscrabble existence among the detritus of those who've been this way before.</p>
        <p>''If you don't have enough money to buy whatever you want, it's hard to prove that you are Yourself,'' explains Sundeen's narrator (who, we are informed, is an only slightly fictionalized version of the author). ''And if you don't get money from your parents or a trust fund then you have to get a job, and then everyone can see you're not really Yourself but some conformist instead.''</p>
        <p>This is not Jack Kerouac or Hunter Thompson -- or Charles Starkweather, for that matter. Sundeen's road warrior is decidedly unenthusiastic about the landscape, commenting with ironic detachment on what he sees through the windshield and reacting to events with an eerie, somewhat off-putting submissiveness. He falls in and out of love as if failure were preordained, diffidently reporting on his encounters with September, a young kleptomaniac. To him, even sex is another fraudulent roadside attraction. When the girl throws him over for his friend Beach, the narrator is barely able to summon the energy for bitterness.</p>
        <p>Sundeen's dry, juiceless cynicism can sometimes be very funny: ''A lot of people from big cities are moving into spiritual towns like Sedona and Telluride where they can be Themself and get in touch with the earth. A good spiritual town should have some Indians within 100 miles and good skiing or mountain biking within 10. The stores should sell turquoise bracelets and cappuccino, and there has to be a place to hook up a modem.'' Usually, though, the irony is laid on too thick -- and far too relentlessly.</p>
        <p>Collected from a series of articles written for Great God Pan, a literary magazine Sundeen helped found, the chapters in ''Car Camping'' have been cobbled together fairly well, gaining an unsettling if ultimately unsatisfying cumulative weight. In what passes for the book's plot, three young men -- two part-time house painters and a guitarist with a failing marriage -- decide to head out into the desert on an ill-conceived road trip. But their plans evaporate as quickly as the narrative. Pausing between mishaps and detours, the narrator gives us a little history here and there, none of it terribly compelling; in his eyes, the waste, cruelty and stupidity of the past blend seamlessly into the present, a vapid continuum of goofballs, eccentrics and scroungers.</p>
        <p>The prose comes truly alive only when Sundeen is describing the technical satisfactions of house painting, ditch digging and pipe repair. Leisure time is dead time -- our hero always seems unsure about where to go, what to do or why. His friends aren't really such good friends, and he hangs out with them mainly because they happen to turn up.</p>
        <p>As the book progresses, some enthusiasm does creep into the flat expanses between paragraph breaks. An account of a few hours spent racing around in powerboats makes exhilarating reading after so much lifelessness. And the end of Beach's relationship with September is nicely drawn. But the narrator's tone is so detached, and the characters around him so unlikable, that the reader is content simply to let this driver and his passengers disappear over the horizon.</p>
