        <p>''Is each borough part of the same city?'' This is one of the provocative questions that will be asked Thursday evening of five front-line commanders from the New York City Buildings Department, who each face distinct issues as they regulate more than 800,000 buildings among them.</p>
        <p>All five of the agency's borough superintendents -- Rick Chandler of the Bronx, James Leonard of Queens, Terrence Lin of Staten Island, Ron Livian of Manhattan and Tarek Zeid of Brooklyn -- are scheduled to attend the panel discussion sponsored by the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects.

        <p>''Is each borough part of the same city?'' This is one of the provocative questions that will be asked Thursday evening of five front-line commanders from the New York City Buildings Department, who each face distinct issues as they regulate more than 800,000 buildings among them.</p>
        <p>All five of the agency's borough superintendents -- Rick Chandler of the Bronx, James Leonard of Queens, Terrence Lin of Staten Island, Ron Livian of Manhattan and Tarek Zeid of Brooklyn -- are scheduled to attend the panel discussion sponsored by the New York Chapter of the American Institute of Architects. The moderator will be Steven Zirinsky, an architect in Long Island City, Queens, who is chairman of the chapter's building code committee.</p>
        <p>Some issues, like the self-certification of building plans by architects and engineers, are of citywide interest, particularly after the collapse of a building in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, last November, in which a worker was killed.</p>
        <p>Others are more peculiar to the boroughs. The big headache for buildings officials in Queens, Mr. Zirinsky said, is the illegal conversion of row houses into multifamily dwellings. In Brooklyn, he said, the hot issue involves structures built as doctors' offices or nursing homes under the more liberal ''community facility'' zoning that are then converted to commercial or residential developments.</p>
        <p>The panel is to convene at 6 p.m. in the chapter office, 200 Lexington Avenue, at 32nd Street. The fee is $5 for A.I.A. members, $10 for nonmembers. Seating is limited.</p>
