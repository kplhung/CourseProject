        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I read with interest the lead article in the April 30 Real Estate section, ''When Rent Becomes the Show Stopper,'' about performing-arts groups and their long-term space-rental patterns.</p>
        <p>Although the writer did not discuss the real estate needs of the music community, they exist too. The vast majority of music groups, from emerging to established, are itinerant. Their rentals for rehearsal and performance space are short-term, by the hour or day or multiples thereof. They need space for rehearsing and performing that is acoustically supportive, affordable and conveniently located. Now music groups ''settle,'' and for orchestras the shortage of adequate rehearsal space is particularly acute.</p>

        <p>I read with interest the lead article in the April 30 Real Estate section, ''When Rent Becomes the Show Stopper,'' about performing-arts groups and their long-term space-rental patterns.</p>
        <p>Although the writer did not discuss the real estate needs of the music community, they exist too. The vast majority of music groups, from emerging to established, are itinerant. Their rentals for rehearsal and performance space are short-term, by the hour or day or multiples thereof. They need space for rehearsing and performing that is acoustically supportive, affordable and conveniently located. Now music groups ''settle,'' and for orchestras the shortage of adequate rehearsal space is particularly acute.</p>
        <p>This August, to help lessen this systemic problem, Exploring the Metropolis will launch a free interactive Web site clearinghouse called www.nycmusicplaces.org. The clearinghouse will identify available spaces in the five boroughs for music groups to rehearse and perform.</p>
        <p>This systematic approach will include data on appropriate spaces not just in the standard rehearsal and performance venues but also in nontraditional settings, such as educational and religious institutions, museums and libraries, cultural and community centers. For these facilities, using their down time more productively will also mean earned income.</p>
