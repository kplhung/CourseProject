        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>Fortunately for Corey Johnson, he has received the crucial support he needs from his family, coaches, peers and school. That he hails from Massachusetts and has been able to come out as an athlete is not unrelated. There, educators have worked very hard to see homophobia in our schools for what it is: a public health problem.</p>
        <p>In the 1995 Massachusetts Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students were asked to identify themselves as gay, lesbian, bisexual or straight. When compared to their peers, the nonstraight respondents were four times more likely to have attempted suicide, five times more likely to miss school because of feeling unsafe, and nearly five times more likely to have used cocaine. Armed with this and other information, there was a statewide response.</p>

        <p>In the 1995 Massachusetts Youth Risk Behavior Survey, students were asked to identify themselves as gay, lesbian, bisexual or straight. When compared to their peers, the nonstraight respondents were four times more likely to have attempted suicide, five times more likely to miss school because of feeling unsafe, and nearly five times more likely to have used cocaine. Armed with this and other information, there was a statewide response.</p>
        <p>I am convinced that Corey Johnson was able to gain the support he needed from his coaches and teachers because of the efforts to train faculty and others who work with our youth.</p>
        <p>But we still have a long way to go. Studies have reported that a high school student of any orientation hears an anti-gay comment about every seven minutes, 26 times per school day. These comments are ignored by teachers 97 percent of the time and more than half of all students have heard the same remarks by a school employee.</p>
        <p>The kind of training and education on homophobia that is going on in the Middletown, Mass., school district is desperately needed in communities everywhere.</p>
