        <p>John Steele Gordon letter on Stephen Sondheim and Ned Rorem's April 30 article on difference between opera and musicals holds difference lies in words, not music</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It seems to me that both Stephen Sondheim and Ned Rorem missed the boat slightly in their discussion of the difference between opera and musicals [''Musical or Opera: Which Is It?,'' April 30]. That difference lies not so much in the music, which has increasingly overlapped. It lies in the words.</p>
        <p>Except for Lorenzo da Ponte, I can't think of the name of a single opera librettist. Even da Ponte is as famous for adding to the cultural tone of early 19th-century New York and having his portrait painted by Samuel F. B. Morse as he is for writing the words to ''Don Giovanni'' and ''Le Nozze di Figaro.'' There's a reason for this: even if you understand the language they are written in, it is nearly impossible to understand the words as they are sung in opera. Hence they are unimportant.</p>

        <p>Except for Lorenzo da Ponte, I can't think of the name of a single opera librettist. Even da Ponte is as famous for adding to the cultural tone of early 19th-century New York and having his portrait painted by Samuel F. B.

There's a reason for this: even if you understand the language they are written in, it is nearly impossible to understand the words as they are sung in opera. Hence they are unimportant.</p>
        <p>But the Broadway lyric in its earliest days was heavily influenced by Gilbert and Sullivan. And Gilbert, who loved wordplay, wrote very carefully and insisted that his words be understandable. As American musical theater matured, Broadway lyrics came to be much more than just clever puns and intricate rhymes; they became profound. Thus they became as important to the song as the music itself.</p>
        <p>That's why, while Kern, George Gershwin and Rodgers (and Sondheim) are immortal, so, equally, are Hart, Ira Gershwin and Hammerstein (and Sondheim).</p>
