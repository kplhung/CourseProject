        <p>There are indexes for countries. There are indexes for industries. So why not indexes for the sexes?</p>
        <p>Finding benchmarks for the male side of the equation would be a cinch. Consider the Dow Jones industrial average. Not only is it named after a couple of guys -- Charles Dow and Edward Jones -- but so are various of its 30 companies: J. P. Morgan and Walt Disney, for example, and McDonald's, as in Ronald.</p>
        <p>More significant is that just one of its companies has a woman chief executive, Carleton S. Fiorina of Hewlett-Packard.</p>
        <p>So what about an index for companies headed by women?</p>
        <p>An answer is the Equity index, a new, price-weighted benchmark of 25 companies. It is the creation of Jane Berentson, editor of Equity magazine, which is devoted to women's financial matters.</p>
        <p>In addition to Hewlett-Packard, the index includes a surprising number of Internet buzz stocks like eBay, where Meg Whitman is chief executive; Exodus Communications (Ellen M. Hancock); and iVillage (Candice Carpenter).</p>
        <p>''Women are well represented in corporate America but not in the Fortune 500,'' said Ms. Berentson, who is also an executive editor of Worth magazine. ''A lot of them are in technology and the Internet.''</p>
        <p>The new index isn't all new economy. Avon Products (Andrea Jung, chief executive) made the cut. So did a textile maker,  Springs Industries (Crandall Close Bowles), and the Tennant Company, a manufacturer of floor-cleaning machines (Janet M. Dolan).</p>
        <p>In compiling the list, Ms. Berentson said she looked for companies with market capitalizations of more than $200 million and for a fair degree of share liquidity. But she was not particularly scientific in the process.</p>
        <p>The mettle of any index, of course, is performance. Zacks Investment Research of Chicago back-tested the Equity index and the Dow to March 5, 1999, and found that the women beat the men: through May 5, the Equity index returned 20.8 percent, compared with 8.6 percent for the Dow.</p>
        <p>Ms. Berentson attributes the Equity index's outperformance over that time to the fact that women have been able to climb to the chief executive's job more easily at technology companies, which led the market. Some 45 percent of the index's stocks are technology companies.</p>
