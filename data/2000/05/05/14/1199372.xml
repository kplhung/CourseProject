        <p>As a retired high school teacher and longtime adjunct at various colleges, I applaud ''Adjunct Professors: Low Pay And Hard Going'' [May 7].</p>
        <p>I take exception, however, to a misstatement of fact the author attributes to Charles Fleischman of Hofstra University, referring to the adjuncts not bringing the level of expertise the colleges require and to their lesser experience.</p>
        <p>The truth of the matter is that a considerable number of adjuncts hold doctorates and most have had more years in the classroom than full-time college teachers. In my own case, I have spent half a century in the profession, including 11 years as an adjunct at Hofstra.</p>
