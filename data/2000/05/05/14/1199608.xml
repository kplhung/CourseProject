        <p>When Bill Clinton leaves the presidency in less than a year, few assume that he will hang out a shingle and practice law. Nonetheless, he is battling to keep his law license in Arkansas in a proceeding that could result in his being disbarred or suspended from the practice of law. In a recent filing, Mr. Clinton disputed the main charge against him -- that he lied under oath when he denied having had a sexual relationship with Monica S. Lewinsky -- by continuing to insist that his answers were technically accurate if misleading. A decision may come later this month.</p>
