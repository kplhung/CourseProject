        <p>ALMOST everyone who knows Larry Fink, the photographer, describes him as a wild man, part Hunter S. Thompson, part Roberto Benigni, who embraces life with a bearhug and plenty of howling.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fink, 59, lives in a stone house on a farm in Martins Creek, Pa., where the crowing of roosters blends with saxophone riffs. (He is a jazz fan.) One tree near the house appears to be decorated with white ribbons a la Martha Stewart. In fact, on closer inspection, the ribbons turn out to be animal bones.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fink's photography studio is in a ramshackle, crumbling barn that's furnished with unexpected Oriental rugs and pictures of fashion shows and parties from his new book, ''Runway: Photographs by Larry Fink'' (Powerhouse Books). In his pictures, supermodels and socialites appear bored, fragile, full of stage fright or as exhausted as furniture movers.</p>
        <p>Eight years ago, Mr. Fink barreled down his dirt driveway to attend a party in nearby Easton. That night, he met Martha Posner, a sculptor and painter with a gravelly voice and red, unruly hair. On the dance floor, she moves like a belly dancer. ''There she was, essentially sweet but unbelievably hot,'' Mr. Fink remembered. ''She's energy-filled, frazzled but centered at the same time.''</p>
        <p>A few nights later, he invited her out to dinner, arriving at her apartment door in Easton holding a bouquet of hand-picked red peppers. ''I thought, 'this is very cool, very smart, very thoughtful,' '' Ms. Posner, 43, remembered. ''Flowers are easy. Peppers are hot!''</p>
        <p>Still, Ms. Posner, who had recently been divorced, was reluctant to get involved. ''Larry really, really courted me,'' she said. ''He made dinners for me. He took me to jazz clubs. He converted part of his barn into a studio for me. That was a big one. We're talking massive renovations.''</p>
        <p>Six months after they met, she moved onto his farm, not certain how things would work out. ''It wasn't love at first sight,'' she said. ''It wasn't even a slow burn. It was just a simmer, and then all of a sudden we were boiling away.''</p>
        <p>Now they can often be found soaking in their hot tub, planting flower gardens, looking at each other's work, dancing on the porch or arguing. Mr. Fink, who has been divorced twice, describes their relationship as ''contentious but harmonic.''</p>
        <p>For their contentious periods, he built her a cabin. ''I have my own little house here, which is always good for relationships,'' Ms. Posner said. ''Sometimes, I just need to chill and dance around to Santana.''</p>
        <p>Their wedding, on May 7 in a meadow on the farm, was full of music, animal sounds, and people in Hawaiian shirts. The bridegroom, who wore olive pants and an olive shirt from Orvis, looked ready to cover a war in the tropics. The bride, in a bronze-color raw silk skirt and a bustier, looked like a country flirt in an Edna O'Brien novel. As goats bleated, Champagne corks popped and cameras clicked, they were married under a tangled twig archway that seemed to grow out of the ground.</p>
        <p>Afterward, guests followed paths all over the farm. In a clearing, a musician played a washboard, while guests danced around rabbit hutches and a tulip garden. Elsewhere, a small tent was set up to showcase a tall, ochre and blue Margaret Braun wedding cake, which looked as if it were made of painted plaster that had peeled over the years. Late in the hot day, the bride took off her top and changed into a black bra, which she wore with her skirt. ''It's her party, and she'll disrobe if she wants to,'' said Katherine Russell Rich, a writer among the guests.</p>
        <p>Another guest, Bill Hunt, a picture dealer from Louisiana, said the couple had the Cajun spirit -- down to earth, friendly, fiery people who love music and food and are comfortable around all kinds of wildlife. ''I've never seen two people touch each other more than they do,'' Mr. Hunt said. ''That's not Cajun, though. That's lucky.''</p>
