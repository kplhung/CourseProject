        <p>George W. Bush had just nailed down the Republican Party's presidential nomination with his Super Tuesday primary victories, and in Texas it was a night to celebrate. (The campaign contributions were not down the drain after all, thank you, Jesus.) Yet the winner's top strategist, Karl Rove, moved uncomfortably through the victory bash at the Four Seasons in Austin that evening. ''The king has arrived!'' someone shouted at Rove, and the king winced. ''This is because of you,'' said a woman who dribbled her drink on his jacket as she hugged him. When Michael Levy, the publisher of Texas Monthly, knelt before him with a flourish and pretended to kiss his ring, Rove turned around, bent over at the waist and hiked up his jacket. As in, ''Kiss this.''</p>
        <p>Rove was laughing, of course. Everyone was. But bristling, too, not so far underneath, at even this celebratory moment. When I asked him if he was enjoying himself, he said no. ''Boring, man, boring,'' he yelled, raising his voice to make himself heard. He didn't seem so much bored, though, as thrown by all the attention -- particularly the positive stuff. As his wife, Darby, later remarked, ''He knows they can turn on you at any time.'' Rove looked nervous about taking any credit away from his old friend George, who is wary of high-profile handlers.</p>
        <p>It was Rove who hatched the whole concept of the Bush campaign, starting with the parade of Republicans who showed up in Austin begging the governor to run. But after Bush lost to Senator John McCain in New Hampshire and later in Michigan, there was widespread panic among campaign contributors and plenty of grousing from Daddy Bush's old team: what did this Rove really know about running a national campaign? The question hasn't gone away either. In his own party, he is seen by many as both too inexperienced and too smitten by his candidate to be of much use. Yet the story here is not ''Jethro Runs a Presidential Campaign.'' If George W. Bush is not elected president, it won't be because Karl Rove isn't tough enough. And he is not in love.</p>
        <p>In the last 20 years, Rove has run and won most every major Republican campaign in Texas, and he has been relentless in the service of his clients and their conservative cause. And if some of his cutthroat, cowboy image is hype -- he is awfully eager to talk about his old buddy Lee Atwater's profound influence on his life -- the least that can be said is that it's hype that has worked. In Austin, his hometown, he is generally regarded as either: a) a genius, or b) an evil genius, with a subspecialty in screaming, over-the-top phone calls about perceived betrayals, usually of George W. When I started to ask him about the phone calls recently, he cut me off: ''Somebody who had done the wrong thing with somebody I was working for? You bet. Somebody out there bad-mouthing? You bet I'll chew on them. You bet I get in their face.'' His anger is real enough.</p>
        <p>And when I brought up the talk about his experience being too provincial, his response again was pretty macho: ''No, I haven't run a national campaign, but who has? Jim Baker?'' This he said as if being James Baker, who reluctantly ran President Bush's 1992 campaign, is maybe not such a good thing. Rove said he would, of course, be bringing in reinforcements, and already, a number of better-known operatives, including Haley Barbour and Mary Matalin, have been hired to lend advice. Yet Rove could not help adding, sneeringly: ''But do you repopulate the campaign with people from 1908? No!''</p>
        <p>There are other concerns about Rove: he cannot hope to maintain airtight message control -- the hallmark of his earlier campaigns, including W.'s gubernatorial runs -- in the circus atmosphere of a presidential race. And quite possibly, Rove's arrogance and his tendency to take politics personally are not the ideal check on Bush's arrogance and tendency to take politics personally. But Republicans can stop worrying that Karl Rove is too down-home, laid-back, blissed out or otherwise insufficiently aggressive for the job.</p>
        <p>At one point during that big evening at the Four Seasons, Rove retreated to a hotel suite upstairs to crunch numbers and monitor TV chat. He phoned the Bush campaign's communications director, Karen Hughes, to tell her what to say on the air. (Earlier, he had also told her what to tell Bush to say.) Then he disappeared into the bathroom with his cell phone to take a call from Bush.</p>
        <p>Rove and his boss had been on the phone throughout the day, and from his office at Bush central that afternoon, he gave Bush the good news from the exit polls, taking special pleasure in the McCain campaign ''meltdown,'' as he called it.</p>
        <p>''It's not pretty, they say,'' he told Bush on the phone. ''It's not pretty how the numbers are being received. He's going to Arizona, and the scuttlebutt is he's going to his cabin and nobody thinks he can continue. Yeah, recriminations, finger-pointing. No, over there. Oh, big time. It's unbelievable.'' They dished McCain's campaign manager, Rick Davis, or at least Rove did: ''Yeah, he is a bad guy. This guy was a lobbyist for Imelda Marcos and General Abacha of Nigeria! Just the consummate inside-D.C. thug. He needs adult supervision.'' (Davis's firm, though not Davis himself, did some work for Marcos and for Nigeria when Abacha was in power.)</p>
        <p>Just as Rove finished talking to Bush from the hotel bathroom that evening, boisterous, good-natured Karen Hughes burst into the suite, and Rove told her he just wanted to ''get New York over with so we can go home.''</p>
        <p>''Go home?'' Hughes yelled. ''I want to celebrate.''</p>
        <p>Rove sighed, and she rubbed his shoulders for a minute. ''Congratulations,'' she told him -- quietly, for her. As in, could you try to enjoy it a little?</p>
        <p>They hovered near the TV, and when Bush finally came on CNN, Hughes marveled at how well he was performing. ''He's really gotten good at doing these satellite feeds,'' she said. ''He'd never done any before.''</p>
        <p>Rove, though, was still frowning. And when Bernard Shaw asked the governor whether, ''if you were to win the delegates in California but lose the popular vote,'' McCain might conceivably stay in the race, Rove bellowed at the screen: ''Hey, what if we win both? Will you --''Then he said something that was not ''kiss my ring.''</p>
        <p>You won't be seeing any gauzy, feel-good clips from Karl Rove's early life in a campaign video at the convention this summer. Dad -- his adoptive dad -- was gone a lot, working. Mom moved the family around, restless. The kid missed him, fought with her. Finally Dad left for good. On a Christmas Day, actually. Then Mom packed for Reno. And later, when he was all grown up, she killed herself. ''Nothing special about the Roves,'' Karl summed up defiantly when asked some pap question about where he had grown up. (Answer: Out West, Colorado mostly, though he went to high school in Salt Lake City.)</p>
        <p>At 49, all round and successful and stressed out by the right things now, Rove sat in his Austin office and looked back on his younger self as a ''strange kid'' who grew into a ''big nerd, complete with the pocket protector, briefcase, the whole deal.'' He loved history and books of all kinds, really, and spent most of his free time in the library, preparing for his debating-team competitions.</p>
        <p>His debating partner and best friend in Salt Lake City, Mark Dangerfield, now an attorney in Phoenix, said that one thing that really seemed to bother his friend back then was that ''he was raised in a completely nonreligious home.'' When I asked Rove about this, he said: ''I'm not sure I've ever found faith. Others here'' -- others in the campaign, including George W. -- I know how much their faith sustains them. Some of them have a prayer group. I haven't been good enough yet.''</p>
        <p>At some point, politics, conservative politics, became Rove's true religion -- though his family wasn't Republican or in any way political, for that matter. And right from the beginning, he saw politics as a contact sport: ''The little girl across the street I can remember beating the hell out of me in 1960 because I was for Nixon and she was for Kennedy. She had a couple of years and a few pounds on me, and I can remember being on the pavement.'' He volunteered for one of the campaigns of Wallace F. Bennett, the Utah senator, while still in high school, and essentially he never came off the trail.</p>
        <p>College was off and on: Rove began at the University of Utah in 1969, thinking of majoring in political science, but after his parents split up during his freshman year, he says, ''I had to start to fend for myself.'' To earn money for school, he worked in a convenience store and was robbed at gunpoint. And he never did get a degree, still a tender spot with him. One thing he seems to like best about Bush, in fact, is that the governor seems to share some of Rove's resentment of Ivy Leaguers, though he is one himself.</p>
        <p>All that Rove went through when he was young made him into a man his wife, Darby, describes as ''a combination of in-your-face and sensitive.'' Darby Rove is a graphic artist who worked for her husband's political direct-mail business before they were married, and over a long lunch earlier this spring she was both admiring and bracingly frank about him. She called him a creative genius and a committed father to their 11-year-old son, Andrew, but also said he can be fierce and quite intimidating, even when he's trying not to be.</p>
        <p>''He's learned to lay back a little bit when he and Andrew play chess,'' she told me, ''but even in croquet he'd be hitting my ball so far I was crying on vacation.'' It isn't only that he's always working, she said, but that working for Republicans is the organizing principle of his life, at the center of his world, which he tends to divide into friends and foes. ''I told Karl the other day,'' she said, ''You see things in black and white. I see lots of gray.'''</p>
        <p>Rove does have a softer side; when I mentioned how much I had liked his wife, who has had a long battle with breast cancer, his eyes filled with tears. ''She is one of the most courageous people I know,'' he said. But as she suggested, he does talk a lot about the forces of good and evil.</p>
        <p>Even in the race he ran to head the College Republicans in his early 20's, he and his allies were ''the good guys'' and his opponent and his supporters were ''the bad guys.'' Atwater, his fellow College Republican, fixed it so that he'd win that campaign, Rove says. Nothing too nefarious, though, just charming some women, who even in that election turned out to be the swing voters. Afterward, Rove hired Atwater to help him in the job, his first real job. And they traveled the country together, recruiting college kids. This was smack in the middle of Watergate -- not exactly go-go years for campus Republicans. But the thing that came across most plainly as Rove talked about his work, then and now, is the sense that he is absolutely unafraid.</p>
        <p>So is he like Atwater?</p>
        <p>''I guess I'm more cerebral and lack his great people skills,'' Rove said. ''And I'm more of a nerd. Lee was a nerd in high school, but then he learned to play the guitar and talk to girls, and I never did. That's serious.'' They both met George Bush in that job, of course, and his son George W. too. And both Rove and Atwater ended up going to work for the elder Bush -- Rove down in Texas, where he has been ever since.</p>
        <p>When I asked people who have worked with Rove in Texas what makes a classic ''Karl campaign,'' they all used the same word: control. He picks a few campaign themes and goes to great pains to keep his candidates on message. A year before Bush first ran for governor, against Ann Richards in 1994, he was invited to participate in a little skit being put on by a Republican women's group in Dallas, and Rob Allyn, a Republican consultant who was working on the event, got a call from Rove. ''He said Bush would make fun of himself, his mother or whatever,'' Allyn recalled recently, ''but he would not under any circumstances make fun of Ann Richards and would appear only on that condition.'' Allyn was floored: ''It's a year out! Bush hasn't even said he's running. This is a skit for the faithful. But Karl has decided that they're not going to run against Ann's personality, because she has a great personality, so he's on the phone, all serious.''</p>
        <p>There are also a lot of stories of Rove's bullying on behalf of Bush. Frank Cahoon, one of the first Republicans ever elected to the Texas House (he is now retired from politics and living in Midland) heard from Rove after Cahoon openly disagreed with some of the appointments Bush made upon being elected governor. He called one Sunday night and went on for an hour, Cahoon recalled: ''Karl was reading me the riot act as a traitor. I said, 'Who cares what some old man out here in the desert thinks?''' Cathie Adams, who heads the Texas Eagle Forum, a conservative antifeminist group, said that after she criticized some of Bush's policies, she got a call from Rove, too: ''You don't cross him unless you want a lot of grief and threats.''</p>
        <p>Rove also tries to keep the press in line. When an Austin publication, The Lone Star Report, ran negative stories about the governor's tax plan in 1997, Rove not only called to complain but also yelled for 45 minutes straight. ''I was sitting 10 feet away'' from the guy who took the call, said the current managing editor, David Guenthner, ''and I could hear every word.''</p>
        <p>A friend of mine in Texas, Anne Marie Kilday, a former colleague at The Dallas Morning News, says Rove called her at home early one morning during Bush's race against Richards. Republicans had been shopping a story about supposed malfeasance by a female state official Kilday covered. According to Kilday, Rove said he was looking over the telephone records of this official, who is a lesbian, and said he found it interesting that there had been a number of calls to Kilday from the official ''at your residence.'' Kilday recalled, ''He said, 'You've just got to be careful about your reputation and what people might think.'''</p>
        <p>When I asked Rove about the story without mentioning names, he said: ''I have no recollection of that. I know exactly who it is, though.'' The official's sexuality, he said, would have had nothing to do with it. ''I would never have had that conversation,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Probably the weirdest story about Rove-related intrigue goes back to 1986, when he was working for Bill Clements, a Republican and a former governor, in his run against Gov. Mark White. Literally hours before the two were supposed to debate for the first and only time in that race, the big news broke that a listening device had been discovered in Rove's office, hidden behind a red, white and blue needlepoint of the G.O.P. elephant. An investigation came to nothing, but the incident infuriated White's people, who accused Rove of planting the bug himself to distract the White camp and muddy White's reputation at a crucial moment. Would Rove really have gone that far for a client? Probably not, I had thought.</p>
        <p>But then I rented a movie he recommended, a Sidney Lumet film, ''Power,'' about the high-flying, low-sinking life of one really smart political consultant, played by Richard Gere. ''I thought of myself as the Richard Gere character,'' Rove had said wryly. ''He has the fabulous office and the New York high-rise and he gets paid $25,000 a month by everybody. You gotta rent this, it's so unbelievably stupid. He's working for this guy who's a total schlump, and of course they get the schlump elected governor.'' Rove's point, he made clear, was that Hollywood was wrong, deliciously wrong. Because in real life, he believes, the schlumps are generally found out.</p>
        <p>It's not such an unrealistic movie, really, but I was surprised to watch as Gere's character discovers, in the heat of a gubernatorial race . . . that his office has been bugged. And as it happens, the movie was released in 1986, the same year Rove's office was said to have been bugged. When I asked him about the coincidence, he laughed, then stopped laughing and kind of cocked his head. Then he said, ''I don't have any recollection of that.''</p>
        <p>The feeling in the Bush camp seems to be that whatever Rove has done has worked pretty well so far; he is fully in charge and likely to remain so. Rove's friend Reggie Bashur, who has worked for Bush in the past, probably summed it up best: ''They're winning, so it's like that old saying, 'If it ain't broke, don't fix it.''' And Rove himself sounds downright complacent about making the leap onto the national stage. ''It's not much different,'' he said. ''In some ways, it's easier, because there are more places where they haven't heard the same thing'' repeated over and over. Moving into the summer, Rove seems to be relying on classic back-to-the-middle moves, getting Bush talking about health care for the poor, for example.</p>
        <p>One piece of good news for Bush is that Rove is not starry-eyed about his man, as is widely believed -- he has enough distance to make cool decisions. There is no question he is wild about Bush as a candidate. But he seems to see Bush as much as a symbol as a man. Once, when I asked him if the Republican takeover in Texas would have been possible without a George W. Bush, he thought about it for a minute, then said, ''If George W. Bush didn't exist, we'd have to find a way to create somebody like him.''</p>
        <p>As Darby Rove sees it, her husband's relationship with the governor is more philosophical than personal. Rove ''has hundreds of friends and no one he's intimate with'' outside the family, she said.</p>
        <p>Not even the governor?</p>
        <p>She shook her head. ''I don't think so,'' she said. ''Neither one of them is going to volunteer their deepest feelings. It's a relationship where Bush just tells you how it is. If he's hungry, it's, 'When's dinner?' and if he's tired, it's, 'I'm going to bed.'''</p>
        <p>Bush has often said he loves Rove's loyalty, and there is the fact that Rove sold his business to devote all his energies to him. But how the candidate really feels about his chief handler is difficult to say; he doesn't like to see too many articles about the help and initially didn't want to be quoted in this one about Rove. ''We handed him the phone and he refused -- he said he just wasn't going to do it,'' a Bush aide explained apologetically. ''He doesn't mind you doing staff stories,'' this aide added, though no one had suggested that he did. ''But he doesn't always weigh in.''</p>
        <p>Finally, the candidate did leave this phone message for me: ''This is Gov. George Bush. I understand you're writing an article on Karl. I've known Karl a long time, since about 1972. I know him as a friend, and I've been in combat with him, political combat, on more than one occasion. I think -- I know -- he's brilliant. He is very witty and fun to be around. He's well read and an all-around good man. Thank you for your interest'' -- long pause -- in Karl.''</p>
