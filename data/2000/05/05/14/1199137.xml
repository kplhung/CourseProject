        <p>And Bear in Mind  (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>BEING DEAD, by Jim Crace. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $21.) Biology is applied to biologists in this blunt novel, which begins with a dead couple, professors of zoology, then flashes back to see how they came so and forward to watch them decompose.</p>
        <p>BLUE ANGEL, by Francine Prose. (HarperCollins, $25.) The sexes and the generations no longer speak in this high comic novel, in which a middle-aged professor is the target of the student he supposes he is exploiting.</p>
        <p>DREAMBIRDS: The Strange History of the Ostrich in Fashion, Food, and Fortune, by Rob Nixon. (Picador USA, $23.) Camouflaged as natural history, ode to gawky beauty (great legs, lipstick, lashes to die for) and social study of precarious empires built on feathers, this book is at bottom a haunting memoir of the author's South African boyhood.</p>
        <p>THE FEAST OF LOVE, by Charles Baxter. (Pantheon, $24.) A luminous he-said-she-said of a novel, in which He (a handsome toadlike man) and She (Ex-Wife No. 1) unspool contrary narratives of their life together, with cameos by Ex-Wife No. 2 and a pair of love-drunk slackers, played out on a stage shot through with moonlight and inky shadow.</p>
        <p>THE HUMAN STAIN, by Philip Roth. (Houghton Mifflin, $26.) The novel's doomed protagonist is a modern converso: a black man passing as a Jew so he'll be taken for white. Our old friend Nathan Zuckerman tells his story, which explores the freighted border between transformation and trespass.</p>
        <p>IN THE FALL, by Jeffrey Lent. (Atlantic Monthly, $25.) Yes, a wounded soldier walks home from the Civil War, but this novel emerges from the shadow of ''C--- M-------'' to tell of the hero's marriage to a runaway slave and their family's disturbing legacy.</p>
        <p>MR. PHILLIPS, by John Lanchester. (Marian Wood/Putnam, $24.95.) When the accountant at the center of this novel is fired, he begins a curious new life, involving a bungee jumper, performance art and a blue movie (these are three separate things).</p>
        <p>RAILS UNDER MY BACK, by Jeffery Renard Allen. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $26.) This restless, sprawling first novel, the story of two brothers married to two sisters, is ultimately a survey of the varieties of African-American experience.</p>
        <p>STORK CLUB: America's Most Famous Nightspot and the Lost World of Cafe Society, by Ralph Blumenthal. (Little, Brown, $25.95.) It was posh, it was swanky, it was tony, but most of all it was New Yorky; a reporter for The Times chronicles the history of the golden-roped nightclub from its birth in 1929 to its asphyxiation by television in 1965.</p>
        <p>WHITE TEETH, by Zadie Smith. (Random House, $24.95.) The novelist, 24, tackles large questions of identity and assimilation in her irreverent debut, which follows two friends, one English, one Bengali, and their families in a tatty London suburb.</p>

        <p>And Bear in Mind  (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>BEING DEAD, by Jim Crace. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $21.) Biology is applied to biologists in this blunt novel, which begins with a dead couple, professors of zoology, then flashes back to see how they came so and forward to watch them decompose.</p>
        <p>BLUE ANGEL, by Francine Prose. (HarperCollins, $25.) The sexes and the generations no longer speak in this high comic novel, in which a middle-aged professor is the target of the student he supposes he is exploiting.</p>
        <p>DREAMBIRDS: The Strange History of the Ostrich in Fashion, Food, and Fortune, by Rob Nixon. (Picador USA, $23.) Camouflaged as natural history, ode to gawky beauty (great legs, lipstick, lashes to die for) and social study of precarious empires built on feathers, this book is at bottom a haunting memoir of the author's South African boyhood.</p>
        <p>THE FEAST OF LOVE, by Charles Baxter. (Pantheon, $24.) A luminous he-said-she-said of a novel, in which He (a handsome toadlike man) and She (Ex-Wife No. 1) unspool contrary narratives of their life together, with cameos by Ex-Wife No. 2 and a pair of love-drunk slackers, played out on a stage shot through with moonlight and inky shadow.</p>
        <p>THE HUMAN STAIN, by Philip Roth. (Houghton Mifflin, $26.) The novel's doomed protagonist is a modern converso: a black man passing as a Jew so he'll be taken for white. Our old friend Nathan Zuckerman tells his story, which explores the freighted border between transformation and trespass.</p>
        <p>IN THE FALL, by Jeffrey Lent. (Atlantic Monthly, $25.) Yes, a wounded soldier walks home from the Civil War, but this novel emerges from the shadow of ''C--- M-------'' to tell of the hero's marriage to a runaway slave and their family's disturbing legacy.</p>
        <p>MR. PHILLIPS, by John Lanchester. (Marian Wood/Putnam, $24.95.) When the accountant at the center of this novel is fired, he begins a curious new life, involving a bungee jumper, performance art and a blue movie (these are three separate things).</p>
        <p>RAILS UNDER MY BACK, by Jeffery Renard Allen. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $26.) This restless, sprawling first novel, the story of two brothers married to two sisters, is ultimately a survey of the varieties of African-American experience.</p>
        <p>STORK CLUB: America's Most Famous Nightspot and the Lost World of Cafe Society, by Ralph Blumenthal. (Little, Brown, $25.95.) It was posh, it was swanky, it was tony, but most of all it was New Yorky; a reporter for The Times chronicles the history of the golden-roped nightclub from its birth in 1929 to its asphyxiation by television in 1965.</p>
        <p>WHITE TEETH, by Zadie Smith. (Random House, $24.95.) The novelist, 24, tackles large questions of identity and assimilation in her irreverent debut, which follows two friends, one English, one Bengali, and their families in a tatty London suburb.</p>
