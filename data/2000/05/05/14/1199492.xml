        <p>MUCH has been made of the National Basketball Association's post-Michael Jordan blues, epitomized by financially troubled franchises, declining television ratings, a rash of empty seats at regular season games and overly drawn-out playoff series.</p>
        <p>But while the Cassandras bemoan the current state of a league that does, after all, generate over a billion dollars in revenue, the Basketball Hall of Fame is considering the inclusion of a long-forgotten Italian immigrant bowling alley proprietor from Syracuse, N.Y., who saved the game when it was really in trouble.</p>
        <p>By the end of the 1953-1954 season, the future of the five-year old N.B.A. was very much in doubt. The game's biggest star, George Mikan, had retired, and attendance was falling sharply in a league that had dwindled to 9 teams from 17 just five years earlier. Making matters worse was the increasing tendency of teams to slow down the game to protect leads or prevent more talented opponents from getting the ball. The final score of one game in 1950 was 19-18, and it wasn't uncommon for a team to pass the ball around for five minutes before taking a shot.</p>
        <p>Pro basketball, which after all was in the entertainment business, had committed a mortal sin: it had become boring.</p>
        <p>''Things went from bad to worse,'' said Maurice Podoloff, the league commissioner at the time. ''The games were interminable. Attendance was suffering. We were in a desperate situation.''</p>
        <p>Enter Danny Biasone, the feisty owner of the Syracuse Nationals. Biasone had emigrated from Sicily in 1918, when he was 10 years old, and by 1946 he owned a bowling alley and a liquor store in Syracuse. Biasone, a self-described sports nut, got so upset when the nearby Rochester Royals allegedly refused to play a game in Syracuse that he vowed to get the city its own pro basketball team. Which he promptly did, procuring a franchise from the National Basketball League in 1946 for the grand sum of $1,000.</p>
        <p>The players became part of Biasone's family. His wife cooked pasta and laundered uniforms for the young men, who had to hold down other jobs in the off-season to make ends meet. In Syracuse, they hung out at Biasone's blue-collar bowling alley. On the road they took long bus and train rides to play in smoky arenas with names like ''The Tub of Blood,'' where hostile fans would shake the basket while the players were shooting and occasionally run out on the floor to slug them with pocketbooks or bare fists.</p>
        <p>Biasone loved it all, and couldn't bear to see his beloved Nats, now in the N.B.A., go under.</p>
        <p>''I knew fans weren't paying to see the ball being dribbled around all night,'' he said in an interview in the mid-1980's. ''So I went to those fellas in the league and said I'm having a tough time selling something here. There's one thing basketball needs, I said. It needs a time. I don't care what the time is. Put in a time!''</p>
        <p>The other owners were skeptical. But Biasone won them over in August 1954 when he invited them to Syracuse to watch his idea in action. On a hot and humid afternoon at Biasone's alma mater, Vocational High School, the future Hall-of-Famer Dolph Schayes and other local players played the first game in which each team had to shoot the ball within 24 seconds or lose possession.</p>
        <p>Biasone started yelling at them if the clock got down to five seconds, while N.B.A. patriarchs like Ned Irish of the New York Knicks and Walter Brown of the Boston Celtics saw the future of the game unfold before them as the players streaked up and down the court.</p>
        <p>THE league instituted the 24-second rule that fall, scoring soared and the pro game was revived. (The Syracuse Nats also won their first and only championship that season).</p>
        <p>''The adoption of the clock was the most important event in the N.B.A.,'' Podoloff said, ''and Danny Biasone is the most important man in the N.B.A.''</p>
        <p>But after he sold the Syracuse Nats to a group of Philadelphia businessmen in 1963 for $500,000, Biasone languished in obscurity. He continued to run the neighborhood bowling alley until his death 30 years later, and, despite several nominations, was never voted into the Basketball Hall of Fame. His supporters hope that historical neglect will be rectified next week, however, when the Hall of Fame, which is once again reviewing Biasone's contributions, announces the newest members of the league's pantheon.</p>
        <p>And why 24 seconds?</p>
        <p>''I figured we were averaging about 60 shots a game per team,'' Biasone said. ''If each team used up 24 seconds for a shot, they would average 60 shots. But the exact number wasn't important. My idea was to keep the game going, to speed it up.''</p>
