        <p>ON a recent Thursday evening, at the grand opening of Maize restaurant, a crowd of men in five-button suits and young women wearing Prada and DKNY mingled over passed hors d'oeuvres of tuna tartare, sipping glasses of Gray Goose vodka. As a jazz singer in a spaghetti-strap dress sang ''La Vie en Rose,'' flashbulbs captured the smiles of young artists and musicians, next to the beaming mayor, two former governors and the ageless baseball icon Yogi Berra.</p>
        <p>It may have looked like the opening of the latest bistro on Park Avenue South or Spring Street, but what made the gathering notable was that it wasn't in Manhattan at all; it was in downtown Newark, a city not much known for chichi restaurants and the clientele to match.</p>
        <p>''There's this incredible energy of young artists and writers and musicians coming here, drawn to the realness of the city,'' said Verushka Spirito, a young woman with a Sinead O'Connor haircut, who stood at the bar with friends.</p>
        <p>The opening of Maize, at 50 Park Place, inside the historic Robert Treat Hotel, was certainly a big event by Newark standards; it is easily the most fashionable restaurant the city has seen in years, with a sleek, airy dining room, cigar lounge and tearoom, and an executive chef, Pat Kotsonis, whose resume includes Le Bernardin and Bouley.</p>
        <p>It's another indication that a city long moribund, an easy target of late-night monologuists (''First prize is one week in Newark; second prize is two weeks in Newark'') is reawakening. Besides an economic resurgence and ambitious real estate developments, Newark is seeing a much less publicized flowering of artists, writers and musicians -- honest-to-goodness bohemians. Hard to believe, but it may be transforming itself into a cool city.</p>
        <p>Last Saturday night, Queen Latifah -- the rapper, actress, talk show host and Newark native -- gave a record-release party for her Flavor Unit Entertainment stable of hip-hop artists at Groove, a local nightclub. She is negotiating to develop the Griffith Building on Broad Street into luxury apartments, a restaurant and a nightclub. Shaquille O'Neal, the National Basketball Association's most valuable player, sneaks back to his native Newark from Los Angeles for soul food at Je's Restaurant on Halsey Street, and he is also looking to invest in the city, Mayor Sharpe James said.</p>
        <p>Rumors have swirled that Robert De Niro is taking over a waterfront restaurant, though Mr. De Niro's partner in the TriBeCa Grill in Manhattan, Drew Nieporent, said he was unaware of any such plans. Well then, maybe James Gandolfini should think of buying into a riverfront bistro; after all, his Tony Soprano -- inarguably the coolest character on television today -- came by his childhood neuroses in Newark.</p>
        <p>It is not the Jersey chic of ''The Sopranos,'' however, that is luring artistically inclined young people to inner Newark. Nor is it the recent building boom, which includes a new baseball park where the minor-league Newark Bears play and a downtown arena that will be home to the New Jersey Nets and the Devils by 2004.</p>
        <p>Instead, young transplants cite the reasonable rents and 15-minute trip to Manhattan by New Jersey Transit train; the vibrant mix of Portuguese, Spanish and Brazilian restaurants and bars in the Ironbound section; and a grass-roots fine arts and music scene, which draws even New Yorkers on a reverse night-time commute.</p>
        <p>''We've got a lot of friends that come out from Brooklyn and Manhattan for Sounds of the City,'' Elisabeth Ssenjovu, a programmer of events at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, said of the free outdoor series she oversees. It begins June 1 and features spoken word, rap, reggae, Latin jazz, Dominican and Haitian music. ''It's Sounds of the City, not sounds of the suburbs,'' she added.</p>
        <p>Lawrence P. Goldman, the president of the three-year-old performing arts center, which normally books top national artists like the Mark Morris Dance Group, pointed out that the home-grown outdoor series has played an interesting role in the city's social life. ''There's a huge young middle-class now in Newark -- white, African-American and Hispanic -- for which there had previously been no civic gathering place,'' he said. ''Basically, what Newark really needed was a good singles scene. That's what Sounds of the City provides, and it doesn't require police or security guards. All it requires is young people willing to meet each other and have a good time.''</p>
        <p>Naturally, there are skeptics. Many Manhattanites, familiar with the stigma of crime and urban decay that has long hung over this, New Jersey's largest city and still one of its poorest, refuse to believe there's a new Newark. ''Get out of here,'' said Chris Hulbert, a publicist, who has represented trendy New York clubs like Hush and Ohm. ''There's no way Newark is cool.''</p>
        <p>But to spend an afternoon and evening with Ms. Ssenjovu and some of her friends is to get an unmistakable taste of the East Village on the Passaic River. There is a thriving literary movement, ranging from the online Newark Review to a spoken-word series -- whose host is Ras Baraka, a son of Amiri Baraka, the former LeRoi Jones -- at the Lama Lounge on Linden Street.</p>
        <p>There's the smoky, couch-filled Euphoria Cafe, in the shadow of the Prudential Insurance Company's global headquarters, at Broad and Academy Streets, which draws a dreadlocked collegiate crowd (and even some suits from Prudential) to poetry slams.</p>
        <p>In many ways, Ms. Ssenjovu, 24, tall, lean and wildly energetic, seems to embody the hip side of Newark. ''I grew up in the Jersey suburbs, in Union County,'' she said. ''My family's originally from the Ironbound. They're Italians who moved out to the suburbs, and I guess I've come full circle now.'' She lives with her husband, Patrick, a Ugandan-born actor and performer, in a renovated chocolate factory in the Ironbound, which got its name from the rail lines that encircle it.</p>
        <p>Stephanie Voulgaris, the owner of Maize, who was born and raised in Kalamata, Greece, says she has waited years for the city's long-trumpeted renaissance to finally take hold. ''I got excited about three years ago in all the activities upcoming in Newark, and I decided that's where I wanted to invest in and to stay,'' she said. When the arts center opened, ''there was no doubt in my mind that it was no longer just a dream -- it was a reality,'' she continued, adding: ''I'd say that the difference I've seen in three years is breathtaking. There are streets where nobody ever wanted to be around 6 p.m., and now people freely walk around at 10 or 11 o'clock.''</p>
        <p>A generation ago, Harper's magazine called Newark, which never fully recovered from the rioting of the 1960's, the ''worst city in America.'' Its vast tracts of housing projects inspired the nickname Brick City. Nowadays, violent crime is down more than 50 percent from 1995, and real estate values in the immigrant-heavy Ironbound have risen 30 to 40 percent since 1997.</p>
        <p>As they toured the streets of the working-class Ironbound, Ms. Ssenjovue and her posse of friends, including Fernando Baptista, born in Portugal, and Khabirah Myers, a native of Newark, jokingly acknowledged that they have the look of a walking Benetton ad.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if it's just my generation, or my group of friends, but everybody seems to be in an interracial relationship,'' Ms. Ssenjovu said. ''My husband and I feel very comfortable here, he being African, me being white. I've traveled a lot, but this is the first place I feel is home. I lived in Berlin, I lived in London. I certainly don't feel at home in the suburbs, but it's weird, I really feel at home in Newark.''</p>
        <p>Lori Barcliff, a young woman who also works at the performing arts center, said, ''My family came to Newark in the 30's; my grandparents lived in the West Ward, near South Orange Avenue.'' After attending college in California and living in Florida, she returned to New Jersey to live in the Ironbound. ''I like the cafe culture that's on Ferry Street,'' she added. ''You go to the grocery store, the bakery, the Portuguese fish market, and you can basically do all your shopping on Ferry Street and not have to get in the car.''</p>
        <p>Asked about recent high-profile investment in the city, including the 11-acre sports arena site that also calls for bars, shops and restaurants, Ms. Ssenjovu said with mock horror: ''Just please don't say we're the new Hoboken! That's my biggest fear in the world.'' She sees Hoboken as a case of gentrification run amok.</p>
        <p>''Newark's still got an urban flavor that I don't think will be changed by that,'' she said. ''It's still really edgy.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Spirito agreed. ''You don't want people moving in and all these yuppie bars erupting and suddenly you're losing the Brazilian flavor and the Portuguese flavor,'' she said. ''You'll lose the Haitian community and the Cuban community. That's what makes Newark, and we have to make sure it stays.''</p>
        <p>For years, Newark has been known as a hip-hop and rhythm and blues hotbed, spawning such artists as Redman, Canibus, Faith Evans, Rah Digga and Lauryn Hill, whose remembrances of her childhood there are captured in her song ''Every Ghetto, Every City.'' (''Every ghetto, every city and suburban place I've been/ Make me recall my days in the New Jerusalem.'')</p>
        <p>At his desk in the Beaux-Arts City Hall, which has served as the backdrop for Hollywood films like ''Presumed Innocent,'' Mayor James said, ''Many of these up-and-coming rap artists have gained strength through struggle, have stepped over a crack vial, stepped over a hypodermic needle, and onto the stage of life.''</p>
        <p>The city's greatest living cultural figure, however, is a Newark expatriate. From his debut novel, ''Goodbye, Columbus,'' in 1959 to his latest, ''The Human Stain,'' Philip Roth, a product of Newark's Weequahic section, has ''turned his bleak part of Jersey and its people into a kind of Jewish Yoknapatawpha County,'' Robert Stone wrote in a review of another novel, referring to Faulkner's fictional setting.</p>
        <p>Mr. Roth's Newark is spectral; the lower- and middle-class Jewish milieu has largely vanished, and his references to contemporary Newark can be biting. ''My father was one of those Prince Street guys who loved that city all his life,'' recounts Swede Levov, the tragic hero of ''American Pastoral.'' ''What happened to Newark broke his heart. It's the worst city in the world.'' He adds: ''Used to be the city where they manufactured everything. Now it's the car-theft capital of the world.''</p>
        <p>Those fictional reminiscences, circa 1995, are now out of date. For one thing, Newark no longer leads the nation in car theft. And many of the 19th-century factories that housed the city's leather, garment and toy manufacturers are seeing a rebirth. On Tuesday, as the temperature topped 90 degrees, Ben Polsky paced around his fourth-floor loft in a factory building on New Jersey Railroad Avenue, wearing shorts and flip-flops.</p>
        <p>Mr. Polsky, 34, is a painter, and he shares a 3,500-square-foot loft with his wife, Holli Schworno, 35, also an artist. ''The scene here is very organic,'' he said. ''The artists who have come to Newark are a lot less interested in meeting a bunch of other artists down at a cafe; they're interested in having enough space to work and still have some semblance of a family life.''</p>
        <p>Originally from Miami, Mr. Polsky moved to Newark eight years ago from New York's Lower East Side. He and Ms. Schworno came before the economic boom, when it was still possible to rent 3,000 square feet for $600 a month. And while rents have risen substantially since then, huge  studios in the Ironbound still cost a fraction of those in New York City.</p>
        <p>In Manhattan, ''what they call artists' lofts all look like multimillion-dollar Ikea ads,'' he said. His loft, across the street from the elevated railroad tracks separating the downtown from the Ironbound, is undeniably authentic: stiflingly hot, paint-splattered, strewn with art-making debris. He smiled and sopped the sweat from his forehead as a New Jersey Transit train whirred past his window at eye level. ''We call that our toy train.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Polsky still hears the skepticism from his Brooklyn and Manhattan friends about Newark's newfound hipness. ''We get that all the time,'' he said, ''and quite frankly I hope it continues.''</p>
