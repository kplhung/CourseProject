        <p>FOR the better part of a decade, critics have extolled the food and ambience at The Ryland Inn in Whitehouse. Craig Shelton, the inn's chef, extolls something else: the glories of its garden. ''The garden is the restaurant,'' he said. ''It dictates the approach to cuisine.''</p>
        <p>This holistic philosophy, linking kitchen, garden, cuisine and ambience, is not new. American chefs, led by Alice Waters of Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif., have championed the concept since the 1970's. But in New Jersey, economic factors make it less practical to surround a restaurant with lush gardens, even if they produce raw materials for the menu. Jack Boehlert, owner of the Stockton Inn in Stockton, summarized the problem neatly; ''Most people who think about the costs of doing business are not going to use one-third of the seating area to make a garden.''</p>

        <p>FOR the better part of a decade, critics have extolled the food and ambience at The Ryland Inn in Whitehouse. Craig Shelton, the inn's chef, extolls something else: the glories of its garden. ''The garden is the restaurant,'' he said. ''It dictates the approach to cuisine.''</p>
        <p>This holistic philosophy, linking kitchen, garden, cuisine and ambience, is not new. American chefs, led by Alice Waters of Chez Panisse in Berkeley, Calif., have championed the concept since the 1970's. But in New Jersey, economic factors make it less practical to surround a restaurant with lush gardens, even if they produce raw materials for the menu. Jack Boehlert, owner of the Stockton Inn in Stockton, summarized the problem neatly; ''Most people who think about the costs of doing business are not going to use one-third of the seating area to make a garden.''</p>
        <p>At the Stockton Inn, shady conditions and rocky soil limit large-scale production of edibles, but homegrown mints appear in sauces and desserts, and flowers are tossed into salads and used as garnishes. The garden is planted with shade-tolerant annuals, perennials and shrubs. Standing amid the rocky outcroppings and waterfalls that surround the terraced outdoor eating area, it defines the restaurant.</p>
        <p>At the Ryland Inn, the main garden consists of two fenced acres that produce vegetables, herbs, fruits and ornamental and edible flowers. Another unfenced acre is home to mulberry and elderberry bushes.  The head gardener, Chip Shepherd, uses the ''French intensive gardening'' system, growing plants close together in raised beds full of organically enriched soil to produce larger yields in relatively small spaces.</p>
        <p>A walk through Mr. Shepherd's beds is a lesson in the art of composing a kitchen garden. Bare earth is rarely visible. Magenta bee balm, the herb best known as the flavoring in Earl Grey tea, leaps out of one bed, as bees hover over its blossoms. The purple blooms of thyme sprawl along the ground. Red-leafed lettuces face upward, their heads resembling many-petaled flowers. A row of basil plants with green and purple varieties planted alternately runs alongside a bushy row of orange-flowered nasturtiums, creating a combination that would be equally at home on a plate or in a vase.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shepherd is convinced that raising fresh, organic produce makes economic, philosophical and gustatory sense. ''It's cheaper to grow your own organic produce,'' he said. (To be certified as organic in New Jersey means, among other things, that fruits and vegetables must be  grown in soil that has not been treated with pesticides or herbicides for at least three years.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Shepherd, who may be the only organic gardener with previous professional experience in the hazardous waste disposal industry, has supervised the garden for  three years. Since the Ryland Inn does not yet have a commercial-size greenhouse, Mr. Shepherd starts the inn's seedlings -- all from heirloom seed varieties -- at his home a short distance away. If all goes according to plan, Mr. Shepherd hopes the majority of the seeds he sows in coming seasons will come from the plants grown in the garden.  The germination rate of these collected seeds is comparable to that of commercially obtained seeds, making them an economical alternative.</p>
        <p>EVERY spring at Mia Sorella, Abbas Aboelata, the father of the chef and owner, Sam Aboelata, plants seeds and starter plants of basil, sage, rosemary, thyme and Italian parsley in the beds that run like ribbons around the restaurant's sunny outdoor patio. By midsummer, the garden is also producing the tomatoes, peppers, scallions, French beans and arugula used in the younger Mr. Aboelata's Italian cooking. This year, according to the chef, walls will be constructed to raise the beds, enabling diners to be close enough to smell and touch the fragrant herbs.</p>
        <p>Because of the ''cut and come again'' nature of the herbs in the garden, Mr. Aboelata is able to supply the restaurant all summer. If there is a surplus of basil, it is dried or frozen for winter use, or made into classic pesto sauce.</p>
        <p>Then there are the flowers. Abbas Aboelata plants them in any space not occupied by vegetables and herbs. Some stay outside to beautify the patio; others are cut for table arrangements inside the restaurant. Homegrown flowers, like homegrown produce, make both aesthetic and economic sense in a business where profit margins can be thinner than French crepes.</p>
        <p>The connection between restaurant and garden is as tangible at the Stockton Inn as the stone that was quarried on the spot to construct the restaurant's original building.  The space beside the structure, created when the stone was removed, is now home to the three-tiered outdoor dining area and garden. Water cascades down the stone walls, and an array of plants fills the raised beds. In the spring, Virginia bluebells share space with boldly colored ranunculus and pansies. Later on, ostrich ferns and other varieties wave over double impatiens. Azaleas and rhododendrons bloom on the steep hillside behind the dining area, and a pair of lace-leaf maples mark the boundary between tiers of the patio. A pair of hibiscus standards, presented to Mr. Boehlert by a customer, claim a sunny spot flanking a walkway.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boehlert began his gardening career at the age of 12, and his career at the Stockton Inn as a waiter six years ago. Since that time he has become chief gardener as well as owner. When he bought the property in 1998, the garden beds were engulfed in English ivy, and the hillside was covered with scrubby vegetation. Gradually he and his crew of part-time helpers weeded out the unwanted greenery and began putting in other plants. In the future Mr. Boehlert hopes to install fragrant lilac and viburnum bushes in the outdoor dining area. For the present he will plant hanging baskets with trailing nasturtium. By summer the flowers will be doing double duty in the kitchen and garden.</p>
        <p>Mr. Boehlert is an avocational painter whose renderings of cyclamens and water lilies hang in one of the indoor dining rooms.  He approaches the garden as both horticulturist and artist, bringing the same sense of composition and color to his outdoor and indoor canvases.</p>
        <p>The fruits of Mr. Boehlert's labors are on display from Mother's Day until the end of the growing season. ''Some people will only come during the summertime,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The gardens at the Ryland Inn are open to both the general public and the restaurant's patrons. Garden tours are available as Mr. Shepherd's time permits, and unaccompanied strolling is encouraged. ''People come here to walk in the garden all the time,'' said Mr. Shelton, who described the gardens as an important link between the Inn and the surrounding community.</p>
        <p>MR. SHELTON and Mr. Shepherd look ahead to the day when the Ryland Inn will extend its horticultural outreach and provide seedlings of organically grown flowers and vegetables to the public. ''Ryland should be part of the community,'' said the chef. Eventually, he and Mr. Shepherd envision cooking and gardening apprenticeship programs at the Inn. ''We want to invite people to participate on an individual level,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Though there is no space to expand Mia Sorella's garden, Mr. Aboelata has his own plans. He wants to build a pergola over part of the terrace. The structure will then be covered with grapevines, providing shade for diners as well as leaves that will make their way into special dishes.</p>
        <p>All three restaurateurs view their establishments as part of a larger community.  ''There is such history here,'' said Mr. Boehlert of his 300-year-old-inn and its 50-year-old gardens and waterfalls. ''My job is to keep it all together.''</p>
