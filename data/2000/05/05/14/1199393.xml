        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Regarding the article ''Hot Market, Bad Blood'' last Sunday, one important piece is missing. When someone sells their home, it is not always just a cold business transaction.</p>
        <p>When I bought my current home, I was very disappointed in the agent I was working with. She did not initially show it to me -- probably because it was not her listing. She knew that the purchase was a very difficult process for me. She not only wasn't at the closing, but never bothered to find out how it went. From past experience I have learned that even though an agent will try to convince you that they will show you everything, that is not always the case.</p>

        <p>Regarding the article ''Hot Market, Bad Blood'' last Sunday, one important piece is missing. When someone sells their home, it is not always just a cold business transaction.</p>
        <p>When I bought my current home, I was very disappointed in the agent I was working with. She did not initially show it to me -- probably because it was not her listing. She knew that the purchase was a very difficult process for me. She not only wasn't at the closing, but never bothered to find out how it went. From past experience I have learned that even though an agent will try to convince you that they will show you everything, that is not always the case.</p>
        <p>After three years, I decided to sell and did not want to use the same agency. I contacted another agent who I liked very much. I was told that I would need to sign a contract and he had to put the listing on the Multiple Listing Service. I did not want to give my money or business to someone else. I know I definitely didn't want to do business with the last agent. I couldn't believe that I had to share my listing with every agent in the county. Somehow this seems ludicrous. Why am I not allowed to do business with only those people I choose to do business with?</p>
