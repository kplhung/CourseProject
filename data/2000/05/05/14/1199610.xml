        <p>Onel de Guzman, a 23-year-old computer student, came forward after several days of hiding and admitted in Manila that ''it is possible'' he had unleashed the program that crippled e-mail systems around the world. The Philippine National Bureau of Investigation did not immediately call Mr. de Guzman a suspect, but said agents would question him. Mr. de Guzman, a student at the AMA Computer College, was suspected after it was learned that he had submitted a thesis proposal that resembled the destructive virus that paralyzed the accounts of e-mail recipients who opened an attachment with the subject line, ''I Love You.'' His lawyer said Mr. de Guzman was ''not really aware that the act imputed to him was done by him.''</p>
