        <p>In the view of the Huntington Yacht Club, a recent appeals court ruling has cleared the way for it to add 14 additional floating dock slips. But the Village of Huntington Bay, which has opposed the expansion, insists the matter is far from over.</p>
        <p>''In no way is it a done deal,'' said the village mayor, Herbert F. Morrow.</p>
        <p>The yacht club's 1997 application to expand had been submitted to the Town of Huntington, which referred it to the village. The village gave conditional approval, but when the yacht club balked at the conditions, the village rescinded its approval and the club sued and won. Justice William L. Underwood Jr. of State Supreme Court ruled that the village had acted in an ''arbitrary and capricious'' manner and had ''arbitrarily singled out'' the club in assessing an application processing fee. He ordered both the town and the village to issue the necessary construction permits immediately.</p>
        <p>The town complied, but the village appealed. On May 1, the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn unanimously sustained the court order and also found that the village ''never had any jurisdiction or authority over the tidewaters and underwater lands over which the petitioner sought to create additional boat slips.''</p>
        <p>The club's lawyer, John L. Rivkin of Uniondale, said it was ''nice to have the yacht club vindicated after all of these years in front of the village, during which the club argued that the village never had jurisdiction.'' He said the ruling meant that jurisdiction over the harbors in Nassau and Suffolk Counties lies ''exclusively with the towns and not the villages.'' He said he expected the expansion to take place in the fall.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Morrow said he believed that the decision was unique to this case and that the village had not yet decided whether to appeal. He also said that the club still needed approvals from three state and federal agencies before it could add the slips.</p>
