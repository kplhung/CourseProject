        <p>ERNEST RUTHERFORD turned out the lights in his laboratory, flipped the switch on a simple machine he had built, then leaned into his microscope and watched as a tiny light show flickered before his eyes.</p>
        <p>He watched as the machine fired helium nuclei into a thin piece of gold foil. The gold atoms deflected the barrelling particles and sent them crashing into a photographic plate placed behind the foil. Each collision created a tiny flash and left a mark that the scientist and his assistant, Hans Geiger, recorded in their notebooks.</p>
        <p>The year was 1910, and Rutherford's famous ''scattering experiment'' led the Nobel Prize-winning physicist to discover the structure of the atomic nucleus, and his assistant to invent the Geiger counter, which would count the particles they had strained in the dark to see. It also began the race to build ever more powerful machines called accelerators, which increased the force of these controlled atomic collisions, enabling scientists to search deeper for the basic components of nature.</p>
        <p>Later this month, the most powerful accelerator to date is scheduled to start up at Brookhaven National Laboratory. The Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, called RHIC by scientists, has been in the making for more than a decade and cost $600 million to build. Nearly 1,000 scientists from around the globe have contributed to the planning of RHIC's 2.4-mile circular subatomic racetracks or to the detectors that will measure what happens when bunches of gold nuclei, circling the racetracks in opposite directions, slam into one another at nearly the speed of light.</p>
        <p>Particle physicists, cosmologists and astrophysicists will learn from RHIC experiments, which are expected to recreate the quark-gluon plasma, a never-observed state of matter believed to have existed in the instant after the Big Bang. At the RHIC dedication ceremony last fall, Dr. T.D. Lee, one of the RHIC theorists and winner of the 1957 Nobel Prize in physics, put RHIC in the vanguard of ''holism,'' the modern approach to science that integrates the study of the tiniest bits of matter with that of the larger universe, or, in the case of RHIC, uses subatomic nuclei to recreate events of the cosmos on a miniature scale.</p>
        <p>What sets RHIC apart from other accelerators is its power. It has 10 times the energy of any previous accelerator, theoretically enough to put scientists over the top in the effort to recreate the quark-gluon plasma. While hints of the plasma were recently reported by scientists at the CERN laboratory in Switzerland, they concluded that CERN's accelerator wasn't powerful enough to provide strong evidence.</p>
        <p>''In collisions of heavy nuclei at ultrarelativistic RHIC energies, we expect not only to make this new form of matter but to measure its properties,'' said Miklos Gyulassy of Columbia University, one of the scientists working on RHIC experiments. ''Up to now, this search has been hampered by the availability of only much lower-energy accelerators at B.N.L. and CERN.''</p>
        <p>If RHIC gets up and running after months of postponements and fine-tuning, a batch of gold ions will be injected into the collider about every 10 hours or so. The ions -- atoms that have been stripped of electrons -- are created from a thin gold foil, which is heated until gold atoms ''boil off'' and are placed in an electric field that fires individual atoms like bullets into a booster that speeds the ions up even more. Then the ions are slingshotted into an older B.N.L. accelerator, the Alternating Gradient Synchrotron, to speed them further until the ions are racing at nearly the speed of light.</p>
        <p>The ion beam is finally steered into the RHIC machine, where it is broken up into separate bunches that whiz around the parallel 2.4-mile rings in opposite directions at 99.99 percent of the speed of light. The paths of the beams are controlled by magnetic fields generated by 1,740 supercooled, superconducting magnets lining the rings.</p>
        <p>All this activity, especially the refrigeration required to keep the RHIC magnets near absolute zero, will require vast amounts of electric power. RHIC is expected to draw between 20 and 30 megawatts from an upstate power plant during operation (one megawatt is enough to power 1,000 homes) and will run round the clock most of the year, according to Thomas Ludlam, associate RHIC project director.</p>
        <p>When the two beams meet at any of six crossover points along the rings, some ions will collide head-on, creating temperatures reaching 200 million times that of the surface of the sun and intense pressure that will dissolve the bonds binding their component parts, the tiniest bits of matter. The resulting dense plasma of loosened particles will last for an infinitesimal fraction of a second, then cool and recombine into a shower of thousands of exotic particles shooting out in all directions and bombarding immense detectors that surround four of the crossover points. The detectors (one, called Phenix, weighs 3,000 tons) are hooked up to arrays of computers that can process thousands of ''snapshots'' of RHIC collisions in a blink of Rutherford's eye and, RHIC scientists hope, provide information about the quark-gluon plasma from which the particles were born.</p>
        <p>Scientists are looking for quark-gluon plasma to answer questions about the interactions of quarks, the fundamental building blocks of all matter. The theory called quantum chromodynamics, or just QCD, classifies quarks into six ''flavors'' -- up, down, top, bottom, charm and strange. Up and down quarks combine to form more commonly known particles like the protons and neutrons of the nucleus.</p>
        <p>According to QCD, quarks are bound together by a force carried by another particle called a gluon. Gluons have an unusual ''stickiness'' -- the harder you try to pull quarks apart the more strongly the gluons hold them together. Conversely, it's also theorized that the gluon force is weaker when it is slack, when quarks are squeezed together. That's exactly what is expected to happen at RHIC, when two gold nuclei containing hundreds of protons and neutrons (each made up of quarks and gluons) collide with such tremendous energy that the ions pass right through one another before they realize they've been hit.</p>
        <p>At that instant, the gluon forces go slack and the quarks become like a bunch of point-sized potatoes floating freely in a drop of thick gluon soup created by the collision. The soup -- at more than one trillion degrees, too hot to eat -- is expected to last for only 0.00000000000000000000001 of a second.  Then the plasma expands until the particles reach a distance where the gluon's binding force kicks in again.</p>
        <p>The quarks then start combining with one another and with antiquarks -- particles with the opposite characteristics of quarks that are created when energy from the ion collision is converted to matter -- in exotic combinations rarely seen outside an accelerator experiment.</p>
        <p>Some such combinations could be dangerous. Last July, an article about RHIC in The Sunday Times of London raised fears that RHIC collisions would create a dense, negatively charged clump of strange quarks -- one of the six types of quarks -- that would gobble up other surrounding nuclei. Theoretically, the article said, the so-called strangelet would attract and swallow every nucleus it came in contact with, eating RHIC, Long Island, even the planet.</p>
        <p>In response to public alarm caused by the article -- one man in Hawaii filed a lawsuit to stop RHIC from starting up -- the B.N.L. director, John Marburger, put together a team of physicists to investigate the risk.</p>
        <p>''The probability that they will be created in the entire lifetime of RHIC is less than one part in 10 billion,'' Larry McLerran, a physicist working on RHIC experiments, said of the strangelet threat. ''I would say, for all practical purposes, it's zero.''</p>
        <p>More evidence against this disaster occurring, Dr. McLerran added, is that it has not yet happened in interstellar space, where high-energy collisions of nuclei are believed to take place all the time.</p>
        <p>Physicists hope that RHIC will help to explain why quarks can't break their gluon bonds under normal conditions and why the mass of a proton is so much larger than the combined mass of its constituent quarks and gluons. Scientists also want to study the transition from ordinary matter to quark-gluon plasma: whether it is a sharp, ''linear'' phase transition like water boiling and turning into steam, or whether the change is much smoother.</p>
        <p>''We want to understand this process -- is there really a phase transition in QCD?'' Dr. McLerran said. ''Does this transition have consequences for the creation of the universe?''</p>
        <p>RHIC is also of interest to astrophysicists who study neutron stars. Though there are not many gluons in neutron stars, the energy-per-unit volume in the core of a neutron star is close to the energy-per-unit volume that will be produced in RHIC.</p>
        <p>''RHIC will be as revolutionary to the understanding of nuclear physics and strong interactions as the Hubble telescope was to astronomy,'' Dr. Gyulassy wrote. ''We will be able to see that much better and much further into this frontier of science.''</p>
