        <p>Completing the Revolution</p>
        <p>A Vision for Victory in 2000.</p>
        <p>By Robert D. Novak.</p>
        <p>241 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>The Free Press. $24.</p>
        <p>IT is extraordinary to recall, given its parlous condition, just how irresistible the Republican revolution looked as recently as 1994. The party of the future was storming the Capitol under Bombardier Gingrich and advancing steadily through the states; the Democrats were rapidly becoming yesterday's men, rooted in big labor and big government, and doomed to irrelevance by a technological revolution that rewarded individual initiative rather than collective muscle.</p>
        <p>What went wrong? Robert D. Novak's new book is billed as ''a vision for victory,'' a call to arms by one of the most recognizable conservative pundits in the business. (For those who cannot put a face to the name, a photograph of Novak on the cover has him looking suitably saturnine.) But much of the book is taken up less with rallying the troops than with castigating the fainthearts who run the party.</p>
        <p>Novak thinks that a big reason for the party's disarray is that it has succumbed to the illusion that it can govern the country from Capitol Hill. Republicans watched George Mitchell run rings around George Bush and concluded not just that they had landed a dud for a president but that the balance of power had shifted. The result was disaster. The White House is a centralized operation that can shape day-to-day political debate. Capitol Hill is a world of warring chieftains and headless chickens. The unequal battle has left the Republicans thoroughly ''Clintonized'': obsessed with polls and competing to spend more public money than their rivals. The only way that the Republicans can complete the revolution is to retake the White House.</p>
        <p>But how? Novak advocates a right-wing version of the ''Bulworth doctrine'': stick to your principles and the polls will take care of themselves. The central political question of our time is actually quite simple, Novak contends: do you prefer freedom or government? Choose freedom and your agenda writes itself: cut taxes, embrace the global free market and use term limits to force politicians to side with the people rather than with the system.</p>
        <p>Novak presents his case with all the verve that you might expect from the co-host of CNN's ''Crossfire''; ''Completing the Revolution'' also contains plenty of delicious detail, reminding us that Novak is a real reporter as well as a talking head. And yet, for all its virtues, his book is more of an exercise in recycling Gingrichism than a genuine attempt to come to terms with conservatism's predicament. Novak regards hostility to government as the beginning of all wisdom. But these days most people are too prosperous to join antigovernment crusades, and too aware of the volatility of the global economy to want to get rid of the safety net.</p>
        <p>Novak wastes a great deal of time in a vain attempt to discredit polls that show waning support for tax cuts. Worse still, he refuses to engage in a much more interesting argument: whether quasi-market mechanisms can be used to redefine public services. One of the best chances Republicans have of winning over women and minorities is to embrace school vouchers, which Novak hardly deigns to mention.</p>
        <p>He is equally unadventurous when it comes to rethinking the Republican coalition. He argues vigorously that the party needs to keep its links with religious fundamentalists. But people like Pat Robertson and Bob Jones are not only incompatible with the ideal of freedom that Novak says he puts at the heart of his politics. They are positively antagonistic to it.</p>
        <p>The Republicans really ought to be the natural party of government, given the triumph of markets and entrepreneurialism. Yet they may not even be able to defeat a scandal-plagued vice president with little in the way of charm or charisma. The problem, put simply, is that the party is now the prisoner of special interests, from lobbyists to religious fundamentalists, who are undermining its ability to appeal to ordinary Americans. Completing the revolution will require rather more internal upheaval than Novak is willing to sanction.</p>
