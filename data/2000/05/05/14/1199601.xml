        <p>Jeff Van Gundy took his usual seat after practice yesterday, leaning back on a collapsible pressed-wood table in front of a trophy case at SUNY-Purchase. His hair mussed, his Knicks T-shirt slightly damp with sweat, he fielded the usual inquiries about his team, including the one about a possible Game 3 hangover today.</p>
        <p>''Certainly it's a blow to us,'' Van Gundy said of the 77-76 overtime loss to the Heat on Friday night. ''But we have the opportunity to bounce back and play well. Indiana went through that last year with the 4-point play. They came back.</p>
        <p>''And you know what? If we don't come back, and if we stay down, then you know what? We don't have what it takes anyway.''</p>
        <p>Basketball analysis is a hobby in greater New York each spring. We debate whether Larry Johnson should be on the bench in the final 12 minutes, whether Marcus Camby should play all 48, why Latrell Sprewell and Allan Houston aren't taking every shot and why Patrick Ewing is allowed to take 10.</p>
        <p>We talk about the Knicks' great offensive weapons and the Heat's athletically challenged roster. We conclude that it will be over in six games, tops. They argue over the same things in other National Basketball Association cities, but not with the same fervor.</p>
        <p>So when we often miss what the playoffs boil down to, how teams advance, we miss in a big way. You can break this series down by the numbers, or reason that one team has psychologically made the other quit.</p>
        <p>Or you can watch Anthony Carter accumulate strawberries on his knees, fearlessly throwing his small body into the fray and emerging with a loose ball the other night. If you play for the Knicks, you have to ask:</p>
        <p>Who's going to be our Anthony Carter? Who's going to risk injury because he simply wants the basketball more than the guy in the other jersey, irrespective of contract, talent level or postseason experience?</p>
        <p>It's all coachspeak in the end, all this talk of desire and purpose. But it's also appropriate today at Madison Square Garden. For the first time all season, the Knicks have put themselves in a position where they must win a game. They cannot go down, three games to one, and have a decent shot of defending their conference title.</p>
        <p>They alternated between underachieving and playing well in the regular season, with flashes of brilliance. They came back against some good teams and won some close games. They discovered how good they could be.</p>
        <p>That comfort level, born out of becoming the first eighth-seeded team in league history to advance to the finals a year ago, may ultimately be the Knicks' undoing.</p>
        <p>The previous 88 games of their season barely matter. Today, in Game 4, we will learn what a team anchored by Ewing, Houston and Sprewell has left, whether this combination of old and new has genuine character.</p>
        <p>Van Gundy referred yesterday to Miami's final possession in Game 3, but he interestingly steered clear of Carter's almost impossible shot from behind the backboard. ''The most telling thing on that last play, when the ball went in, was that Mourning was up over the rim,'' he said of Alonzo Mourning, the Heat center who nearly tapped the ball in. ''He had nobody on him. Pat went to help, and not one small guy sunk and put a body on him.''</p>
        <p>Van Gundy shook his head and added, ''We're just not doing what we need to do.''</p>
        <p>He went on about how Houston's shot ended Miami's season a year ago, while Carter's playground prayer merely put the Heat up, 2-1, in the four-of-seven-game series.</p>
        <p>''One of the things I told the team was, that ended Miami's dream last year,'' Van Gundy said. ''This doesn't have to kill our dream. Our dream doesn't have to die because of his shot, unless we allow it to.</p>
        <p>''That's a critical difference.''</p>
        <p>For all their flaws, watching the Knicks mature this season has been mostly a pleasure. They have developed a closeness on the floor like few teams. They also have a swagger, almost a feeling of invincibility.</p>
        <p>You wonder if that swagger has hurt them at times, the idea that they can rely on things like their wingspans and smooth strokes.</p>
        <p>Houston tried a cutesy behind-the-back pass on a three-on-one in Game 3, resulting in a turnover. ''It's no-look, behind-the-back passes, and that'll get you beat in this league,'' Van Gundy said. ''If you have 1-point games, one turnover, a missed free throw, a block-out. . . .''</p>
        <p>Camby should have held on to a crucial rebound that was swatted away in the final minutes, ending up as a second shot for Miami.</p>
        <p>''This team has a lot of heart, character and pride,'' Camby said. ''It is definitely tough. It's nothing to be proud of when you get outrebounded. They are outhustling us. They seem to want it more.''</p>
        <p>Van Gundy: ''I'm not saying we weren't fighting hard. But they fought a little bit harder last night. They fought for the ball. And you know what? When you fight for the ball, like they did, the basketball gods shone down on them on that shot.''</p>
        <p>We've been told how much talent the Knicks have. Today we'll get a good look at their heart.</p>
