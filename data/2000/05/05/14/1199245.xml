        <p>EARLY on, we had an agreement,'' said the playwright Horton Foote, speaking of his playwright daughter, Daisy, whose ''When They Speak of Rita'' opens on Wednesday at Primary Stages Off Broadway. ''I wouldn't write about New England and she wouldn't write about the South.''</p>
        <p>Taking a tip from her father, the bulk of whose plays are set in the fictional Texas town of Harrison, all but one of Daisy Foote's dramas, including ''Rita,'' take place in imaginary Tremont, N.H.</p>
        <p>To assist in her first major New York production, the author has called on her family -- in the Foote tradition. Her father is directing, while her sister Hallie is playing the title role. Foote devotees are used to seeing the family collaborate. Hallie Foote has for the last 20 years been her father's chief interpreter and has also appeared regionally in Daisy's plays. But the three have never worked on a production together.</p>
        <p>''My father came to a reading'' of ''Rita,'' Daisy Foote explained. ''Afterwards, he said, 'Oh, I think I'd like to direct that.' I said, 'Well, that's a good idea.' '' The part of Rita, a rural housewife whose aspirations are stifled by the men around her, wasn't written with Hallie Foote in mind, but after she read the part, casting her seemed inevitable, her sister said.</p>
        <p>While Daisy Foote's plays are set in the present and possess the trappings of modern life, both father and daughter tend to examine the placid surfaces and turbulent depths of deceptively simple lives. And so the characters in ''Rita'' generate their share of melodrama, from adulterous affairs to even murder.</p>
        <p>Mr. Foote, 84, is forever associated with Wharton, Tex., the small town in which he grew up. (His first New York play, staged in 1941, was called ''Texas Town.'') But a portion of his life, beginning in 1966, was spent in New Boston, N.H., then a one-store hamlet. Out of step with the film and theater industries at the time (though he had won an Oscar for ''To Kill a Mockingbird,'' the one for ''Tender Mercies'' was still in the future, as was the Pulitzer Prize for his play ''The Young Man From Atlanta''), he had retreated into semi-retirement to write, asking his children, he recalled, ''if they would try it for a year and if they didn't like it, we'd leave.''</p>
        <p>Hallie Foote remembered it clearly: ''I was very unhappy. It was the middle of my high school years.''</p>
        <p>Daisy Foote elaborated: ''We went from living on a street in pretty suburban Nyack, N.Y., to being one of four houses on a four-mile stretch of dirt road. It was woods all around us.'' She was 5 at the time of the move and New Boston eventually worked its way under her skin. Asked if the characters in the play are based on people she knew, Mr. Foote lets out a knowing groan before his daughter can reply.</p>
        <p>''Being from a Southern town, there were all kinds of scandals,'' Mr. Foote mused. ''But I never knew such peculiar goings-on as I saw in New Boston. This business of shacking up with another man's wife, it happened a lot, and then they would go right back. That's what I could never get. In the South, they would shoot each other.''</p>
