        <p>Mary Taylor Simeti reports on Ballaro market in Palermo, Sicily, market that has remained faithful to original Arab commerce of fruit, vegetables and grain; drawing (Special Section, The Sophisticated Traveler) (Part 2 of 2-part section) (M)</p>

        <p>Palermo's Ballaro market is as multilayered as Sicily itself. On the ground level, a riveting display of foodstuffs winds along a crowded street in the heart of the Albergheria neighborhood, then spills out into the square in front of the Church of the Carmine, where the serpentine checkerboard of awnings and tarps, red, orange and green overhead, gives way to umbrellas, striped in blue and white as if in deference to the Madonna looking down from the church's facade. And higher still, stern Norman towers, florid majolica cupolas and crumbling Baroque cornices keep watch.</p>
        <p>Ballaro itself is older than any of its sentinels. In the 11th century Saracens did their shopping here, joined by Normans in the 12th. The market has remained faithful to the original Arab commerce of fruit, vegetables and grain, adapting to the short cycle of seasonal change and the longer rhythms of social and economic flux.</p>

        <p>Palermo's Ballaro market is as multilayered as Sicily itself. On the ground level, a riveting display of foodstuffs winds along a crowded street in the heart of the Albergheria neighborhood, then spills out into the square in front of the Church of the Carmine, where the serpentine checkerboard of awnings and tarps, red, orange and green overhead, gives way to umbrellas, striped in blue and white as if in deference to the Madonna looking down from the church's facade. And higher still, stern Norman towers, florid majolica cupolas and crumbling Baroque cornices keep watch.</p>
        <p>Ballaro itself is older than any of its sentinels. In the 11th century Saracens did their shopping here, joined by Normans in the 12th. The market has remained faithful to the original Arab commerce of fruit, vegetables and grain, adapting to the short cycle of seasonal change and the longer rhythms of social and economic flux.</p>
        <p>At my last visit, in early April, spring dominated: pale green fava beans in precarious piles, sheaves of long-stemmed green and purple artichokes, baskets of red strawberries and red again in the blood oranges split open to show their scarlet centers. In front of the bakeries the first trays of marzipan paschal lambs were edging out the last of winter's fig-filled pastries.</p>
        <p>Mingling with spring were hothouse precursors of summer: tomatoes, zucchini, dark oval eggplants and rounder, paler ''Tunisian'' eggplants fading to lavender around their stems. Bunches of mint and basil announced the aromas of the heat to come.</p>
        <p>Recent affluence has multiplied the butcher shops at the expense of those selling grains, yet the latter now offer a greater variety of beans and lentils, together with spices from the Maghreb and the Orient, catering to Palermo's increasing numbers of immigrants. Once again, there are Arabs shopping in Ballaro.</p>
