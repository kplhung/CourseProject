        <p>IS architecture an art? What restrictions can government place on architects without violating constitutional principles?</p>
        <p>A new proposal to overhaul the city's zoning laws is now forcing New Yorkers to confront these fundamental questions. Titled the Uniform Bulk Program, the proposal amounts to the architectural manifesto of the Giuliani administration -- a major statement on the most famous skyline in the universe. The statement goes something like this: New York to Architecture: Drop Dead! At the precise moment when things are looking up for the continuous art of building our great city, here comes the cultural equivalent of the street crimes unit. Back in line! Back in line! We got architecture off the streets 40 years ago, and we're not going to let it back now!</p>
        <p>Proposed by the Department of City Planning, the Uniform Bulk Program is now wending its way through the public review process required before it can become law. The plan has already been endorsed by community boards. The City Council is expected to vote on it sometime this summer.</p>
        <p>But what is it? And why is it here? What's the point? It's hard to get straight answers to such questions. At a public hearing in late April, it was obvious that even members of the city's Planning Commission were in the dark. In a series of exchanges with representatives from civic and real estate groups, the commissioners seemed as eager as anyone to figure out just what their own staff had cooked up. With only a few weeks left to make revisions, the plan headed for the City Council vote has many people asking ''say what?''</p>
        <p>But there is no apparent strategy to deceive the public. The issue is much more complicated. Real estate development and municipal government are two relics of the 19th-century industrial city. In the information age, the power of both groups has vastly diminished. They are both in major denial about this. Both sense that the center of power has shifted to the cultural plane. But neither of them knows how to climb up there. The Uniform Bulk Program is supposed to give them a boost. It's designed to give a cultural aura to what are fundamentally economic and political transactions. Unfortunately, it does so at the expense of architecture that has a genuine cultural contribution to make.</p>
        <p>Some features are discernible within the program's nebula of charts, graphs, codes and bureaucratic jargon. Three of these would have a substantial impact on architecture in New York. The first two we might call the Tops and Bottoms of the new urban silhouette.</p>
        <p>* The plan would set height limits on new skyscrapers throughout the city. Depending on location, the height would vary from 360 feet to 495 feet to 720 feet. Large swaths of midtown and lower Manhattan would be exempt, along with downtown Brooklyn and Long Island City, Queens.</p>
        <p>* The plan would abolish current zoning regulations that encourage developers to create small public parks and plazas in exchange for added height. Instead, new towers would sit on low-rise bases that extend to the street wall. These would typically be used for retail. The planning department describes this so-called contextual format as a rejection of the towers-in-a-park concept encouraged by the 1961 zoning resolution, which is still in effect.</p>
        <p>* The third provision, by far the most ominous of the three, calls for the creation of a design review panel within the city planning department. Chosen by the department's chairman, a political appointee, the panel would consist of ''architects and others concerned with design issues.'' Assuming a function now held by the city's Board of Standards and Appeals, it would review applications from developers seeking special permits that would exempt them from the new contextual zoning.</p>
        <p>Since the Uniform Bulk Program is a political as well as a cultural document, it's worth speculating about the political motives behind it, even though, with such a secretive and rigid city administration, it is natural to suspect the worst. Here are some suspicions.</p>
        <p>The Law of the Instrument states: the instrument must be used. With so many planning functions now performed by other city, state and federal agencies, as well as private business improvement districts, something must be found for City Planning to do. Here it is.</p>
        <p>With only two years remaining in his term as planning chairman, Joseph B. Rose wants to be remembered for doing Something. The Something could just as easily be Something Else. It happens to be this.</p>
        <p>The program is an elaborate operation intended primarily to give Mr. Rose control over the special permit procedure now supervised by the Board of Standards and Appeals. Mr. Rose, who comes from one of New York's most illustrious real estate families, has the makings of a frustrated architect. The special permit process would enable him and his successors to fiddle with forms and shapes without being subject to public scrutiny or accountability.</p>
        <p>Hence, the ultimate goal of the Uniform Bulk Program is to turn the city planning chairman -- whoever it may be -- into the design czar of New York, with sweeping powers to define the cityscape for years to come.</p>
        <p>Like architecture, the Uniform Bulk Program can be analyzed on two planes: the material and the metaphoric. Real estate developers will find the program's material implications of greater interest. What must they do to comply? How much will compliance cost them, in time and square feet? Will there be a grace period for projects in the works? Will the new zoning simplify permits? How will it affect the market?</p>
        <p>Those interested primarily in architectural values must reckon with the program's symbolic as well as its material value. The two realms are interlocked. In architecture, quantity can be a quality. To some developers, tall buildings may signify little more than tall profits. But they are also elements in a skyline that rivals the Gothic cathedral in symbolic power. By the same token, developers may regard a bonus plaza simply as a device that enables them to add more rentable floors. But it is also a void in a city that has little tolerance for undeveloped land. In this case, lack of quantity is a quality, at least if you like voids.</p>
        <p>The sky and the street are in themselves symbolic. They are contested spaces where the rights of private ownership and public use come into frequent conflict. Contestation, in fact, is what these spaces symbolize. We can quantify them in terms of shadow, sky exposure, required seating and trees, but their symbolic value lies in the tension between freedom and equality in a democratic society.</p>
        <p>Contextualism, the overarching ideology of the Uniform Bulk Program, offers to resolve this tension in symbolic form. By limiting the visual impact of new buildings, contextual architecture is supposed to give people the sense that they are in control of their surroundings. This, at least, is the underlying theory. The abolition of plazas, the requirement that buildings extend to street walls, is intended to preserve the existing character of neighborhoods. The adoption of height limits, similarly, is meant to preserve the existing skyline as a picture postcard. The competitive urges of developers like Donald Trump will not be permitted to disturb its Art Deco ziggurat contour.</p>
        <p>In practice things are far less ideal. It is easy to find examples of bonus plazas to illustrate the argument that these public spaces should be abolished. What such examples actually show, of course, is that they were poorly designed, that their developers have no stake in maintaining them and that city officials lack the will to demand improvements. But there are other examples -- I happen to live in a building blessed with one -- in which the bonus park beautifully fulfills its original concept. In real as well as symbolic terms, the park helps bridge the chasm between private luxury and public amenity. This was a worthy experiment for the capital of modern democracy to undertake.</p>
        <p>It scares me to imagine the mentality that wants to preserve the skyline in its present form. It is painful, of course, to make that skyward stretch each time a new skyscraper takes shape and towers over its neighbors. But that stretch is the context of New York. Changes in scale, evolutions in form: these are traditional training exercises for a city that prides itself on its ability to adapt to change. If you don't stop before the miracle happens, a building that once seemed objectionably out of scale may eventually look custom-made to your perception. It is hard to believe that New Yorkers will take to squat, stubby towers with quite the same pride they take in the Woolworth Building, the Chrysler Building and Rockefeller Center.</p>
        <p>At one time, it may have made sense to equate the term ''context'' with a new building's immediate physical surroundings. But the context has changed. The informational city is global. New buildings in New York are inevitably seen in the context of new buildings going up in London, Tokyo, Paris, Sydney and other cosmopolitan centers. And as New York has demonstrated all too glaringly in recent years, abject obedience to the conventional idea of context may violate the expanded context of contemporary urban life.</p>
        <p>History is repeating itself. This is the first thing about the Uniform Bulk Program that will strike those whose memories stretch back as far as the 1960's. Once again, the New York planning department is laying down a set of zoning regulations based on ideas that have been around for 40 years.</p>
        <p>The 1961 zoning resolution, which the Uniform Bulk Program is intended to counteract, was based on ideas first proposed by the French architect Le Corbusier in the 1920's. A critique of picturesque city planning principles then in effect, Le Corbusier's 1923 plan for the Contemporary City was a hybrid of the English garden city and the Futurist utopia of mechanized transportation. By replacing traditional streets with highways and elevators, the plan would clear congested ground area for green, open space.</p>
        <p>The model was taken up by American planners and architects in the postwar years, with mixed results. In New York, Stuyvesant Town, Silver Towers, Waterside remain fine examples of the towers-in-a-park genre. Used as a formula for low-income housing, however, the concept became synonymous with the projects, highrise ghettos for blacks. By the time of the 1961 zoning, in other words, what began as a critique of the status quo had hardened into a new version of it. It had become the dogma of its time.</p>
        <p>Contextualism began as a critique of that dogma, in fact. In 1961, Jane Jacobs's ''Death and Life of Great American Cities'' was an explicit attack on the towers-in-a-park model. Not long after, preservationists widened their scope from individual buildings to entire so-called historic districts. By the late 1960's, it was customary to regard developers and architects as enemies of the city. The animosity was intensified by the postmodern movement, which promised to create buildings more attuned to popular taste.</p>
        <p>Now this critique, too, has congealed into dogma, and is about to be codified into law in turn. And we have already seen the current dogma's dubious architectural consequences. Historic neighborhoods, like South Street Seaport, converted into shopping malls. New neighborhoods, like Battery Park City, designed like prewar theme parks. And stumpy towers on low-rise bases, like One Union Square South.</p>
        <p>But the most toxic effect of the contextualist dogma is invisible. It is the virtual disappearance of architecture from New York in recent decades. The theme park stuff would be almost tolerable if the city had encouraged the development of architecture as an art of reckoning creatively with the changing urban condition. But it has not. Instead, it has continued to regard architecture as an alien presence, an immanent invasion from Mars.</p>
        <p>ONE positive thing must be said about the Uniform Bulk Program. It represents a long-overdue challenge to the excessive power wielded by the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission in recent years. With the creation of historic districts, the landmarks commission has usurped the role of city planning and led the way in the conversion of Manhattan into a theme park. Unfortunately, city planning's effort to check this development does not go far enough. The program's uncritical acceptance of contextualism in fact portends more Disneyfication.</p>
        <p>Too tall, too short, or just right for Goldilocks. Here's the weird thing: everything proposed by the Uniform Bulk Program is entirely a matter of taste. Height, context and quality are all areas where subjectivity reigns. They are matters of personal opinion. I like tall buildings and voids. Others don't. We may all disagree about what distinguishes architecture from real estate. This is as it should be. But how did we get to the point where the legislation of taste could be considered an acceptable function of city planning?</p>
        <p>Zoning began in 1916 as an instrument for protecting public health. People shouldn't live in airless tenements or work in office or industrial buildings that lack adequate light and ventilation. Housing shouldn't be built next to factories or slaughterhouses. The Corbusian Ville Radieuse was promoted as a public health mission. Open space would bring in light and fresh air, eliminating the congestion that bred disease. This was a reasonable, even a scientific, approach to designing cities before penicillin had been introduced.</p>
        <p>In the postwar decades, urban renewal in the United States also came packaged with the rhetoric of hygiene. Slums were cancer. Planners were surgeons. Slum clearance was an operation to remove tumors from the urban body. The goal of planning for public health had shifted from the realm of physical reality to that of metaphor. A tuberculosis pathogen is a physical entity. But a tenement is not a tumor. To view it as such required a certain way of seeing. It reflected culturally constructed ideas about good and bad ways to live.</p>
        <p>Mercifully, the Uniform Bulk Program doesn't even bother with public health metaphors. But contextualism comes with a mythology of its own -- the veneer of Junior League politesse often wielded by philistines on a rampage. ''Practical,''  ''attractive,''  ''innovative,''  ''within the city's enduring traditions'' -- or: sensible pumps, a string of pearls and a splash of naughty French perfume.</p>
        <p>With this program, city planning has crossed a decisive line. Without even a nod to the quantifiable goals that brought zoning into being, it has set up shop in the sphere of aesthetic preference. By embracing contextualism -- or any other aesthetic concept -- city planning enters an area where constitutional protections could apply. While the First Amendment does not protect all forms of communication, the Uniform Bulk Program compels us to ask to what extent architecture is a protected form of speech.</p>
        <p>In the field of urban semiotics, taste is defined as ideology codified in space. The Uniform Bulk Program is a highly ideological document in this sense. It aims to impose an aesthetic standard on buildings throughout New York. But it also offers a golden opportunity to crack the contextual code.</p>
        <p>We inhabit the hub of the advanced capitalist world. We love it here, and even if we wanted to leave, there's no other world to go to. But many of the ills associated with cities -- economic inequality, social fragmentation, disregard for the economically unproductive, the gap between public and private amenity -- are by-products of our way of life. Saskia Sassen, a professor of urban planning at Columbia University, has described ours as the Eviction Society. We exist in a perpetual state of displacement and dislocation created by the economic cycles that drive the fluctuating value of land.</p>
        <p>Architecture has traditionally been used to compensate for these unsavory effects. A century ago, the robber barons of the Gilded Age commissioned architects to design such beloved landmarks as the New York Public Library and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Later, the magnificent spectacle of the Manhattan skyline went far toward mitigating the violence its construction inflicted on the urban landscape. The bonus plaza was conceived as a benefit for those who do not profit from the real estate industry.</p>
        <p>Another compensation -- some might even say redemption -- is the freedom to respond creatively to our way of life. This is no less true in architecture than it is in literature, painting, photography, song or dance. From the Brooklyn Bridge to Frank Gehry's design for a new Guggenheim museum proposed for a site close by, New York's greatest buildings have provided signposts to change. They are forms of communication in which the imagination is placed at the service of truth about its time.</p>
        <p>Up to a point, contextualism offers a useful compensation for the eviction economy. It is in the public interest to protect the environment from being incessantly blown to smithereens. Beyond that point, contextualism becomes a form of brainwashing. Like the private shopping mall designed to look like a public town square, the contextual veneer sends out a false message about the city we actually inhabit.</p>
        <p>The single most powerful deterrent to architecture in New York is the blurring of the distinction between architecture and real estate. Cities may be able to survive without architecture. They can't survive without discrimination in taste. What would be the point? Cities are places where people are supposed to give their best. Without discrimination, who's to know what ''best'' means? Few would claim that Harlequin Romances are literature, yet we now have a skyline packed with Harlequin Romance buildings, clamoring to be recognized as architecture. How to deny them this status in a city where the real thing hardly ever comes along?</p>
        <p>It's easy to overlook one crucial fact about the urban shift from industrial to cultural production: one major industry has not been left behind. Real estate development is an industry of the old economy that remains active in the city of the new. Other forms of manufacturing have been squeezed out of town or shipped overseas. But real estate development still cranks out material product in a city where all else has dematerialized into pixels. When we peer up and watch the cranes swiveling on the skyline, we should keep in mind that we are looking at relics of the old industrial city towering -- if unsteadily -- over the rise of the new.</p>
        <p>And we should keep in mind that municipal government, too, is a relic of the old industrial city -- a dinosaur from the era of ''Meet John Doe.'' Smoke-pumping factories, cigar-chomping tycoons, duplicitous union bosses, agitating longshoremen -- all gone now. Alas, our pols seem to think they're still governing this vanished burg. Except when it comes to hiring campaign strategists, our pols know little about the city of symbolic analysis they govern.</p>
        <p>REAL estate developers and politicians, in other words, need each other more than ever. In addition to their traditional economic codependence -- donations made by developers in exchange for a climate favorable to them -- there is the need for moral support as the pair of them venture into a city that they do not understand or particularly care for. And why should they like a city that is fast accelerating beyond their 19th-century reach?</p>
        <p>The Uniform Bulk Program represents a strategic alliance between these two aging powers trying to survive in a rapidly changing urban environment. Because of its proposed height restrictions, some regard the program as anti-development. The real estate community has responded as if this were in fact the case. But this is just a bit of roughhouse between the dinosaurs. The truth is that both City Hall and developers stand to gain from this transaction. There are those who still believe that contextualism is a positive architectural idea, rather than the anti-architectural refuge it has become. By embracing contextualism as an aesthetic, developers and politicians acquire the aura of cultural value. In their own minds, at least, this qualifies them for citizenship in the cultural city.</p>
        <p>The design review process proposed by the Uniform Bulk Program will provide a more hazardous route to cultural distinction. Imagine that you are a developer. Your architect has proposed a design that does not conform to the contextual zoning. You have two options. You can apply to the Department of City Planning for a special permit. The approval process could take up to a year, with no guarantee that a permit would be granted. Or you can fire your architect and hire a hack.</p>
        <p>But let's suppose that you really want to do the right thing. You apply for the permit. The design review panel is convened. The architect walks into the room to present his project, and the entire table is seated with hacks. The worst kind of hacks. Hacks with opinions. One hack wants a stepped silhouette; another wants an Art Deco crown; a third wants an avant-garde fold; a fourth wants glass instead of stone. If your architect will agree to these modifications, the panel will recommend granting the permit. Otherwise -- hack, hack, hack.</p>
        <p>You will still end up with hackery, just as if you hadn't bothered to go through the process. And the hackery will be much more expensive. But for the extra dough you'll get to put a little golden sticker on your hack job: the City Hall Mark of Excellence. People can go on mistaking real estate for architecture, and rejecting genuine architecture for being weird, far-out and alien.</p>
        <p>Government does have a role to play in raising architectural standards. Paris, Barcelona, Helsinki, Berlin, Tokyo and many other cities use the independent jury system for that purpose. The function of the jury system is to protect architecture from political and economic pressures. As framed by the Uniform Bulk Program, the design review panel could well have the opposite effect.</p>
        <p>This appraisal could not have been written in 1961, even if the Uniform Bulk Program had existed then. Forty years ago, planners and architects operated in a city where the concept of culture had little significance outside the sphere of anthropology. This has changed. The term now extends far beyond the compass of any particular field and has become a common tool for making connections between art, economics, psychology, philosophy and many other fields.</p>
        <p>Architects today are operating in this expanded cultural framework. This is the context of architecture today. It is emerging in the work of designers as various as Renzo Piano, Peter Eisenman, Frank Gehry, Rem Koolhaas, Steven Holl, Eric Owen Moss, Thom Mayne and Zaha Hadid.</p>
        <p>The Uniform Bulk Program has stumbled into this context but is in no way part of it. That is what makes its cultural pretensions so ludicrous. Here was an opportunity for city planning to enlarge the conceptual framework for architecture in New York, to bring architecture into line with the transformations now overtaking urban life everywhere. That opportunity has been lost. Instead, city planning has reheated stale ideas and proposes to pass them into law. It's difficult to accept the inevitability of this.</p>
