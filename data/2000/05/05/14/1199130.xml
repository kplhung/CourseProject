        <p>Six days a week, migrants from Brazil's parched and impoverished northeast occupy the bottom rungs of Rio de Janeiro's social ladder, clinging to jobs as maids or doormen while pining for the simpler life they left behind. Come Sunday, though, they flock to the one place that offers them a chance to satisfy their craving for the music, literature, food and folklore of their native region.</p>
        <p>A dizzying mixture of market and carnival, the Feira dos nordestinos, or Northeasterners' Fair, has operated for decades out of the parking lot of the Campo de S</p>
        <p>The main reason for foreigners to visit the fair, however, is for its music.</p>
        <p>Armed with guitars, duelling pairs of repentistas make up songs on the spot, based on subjects suggested by onlookers; they also sing elaborate multiversed tales that can be traced back to the troubadors of medieval Portugal. There is no better place in Rio to find cordel, bound pamphlets of Brazilian folk legends and songs illustrated with striking woodcuts.</p>
        <p>Rio sophisticates view the fair as something of an embarrassment, and so there is always one movement or another afoot to force it to move to some less visible location. At the moment, though, the city is studying a plan to refurbish the existing site, which is a welcome move. As a visitor to the fair since 1972, I am convinced that the life of the city is enriched by this unaffected expression of a rural Brazilian culture that is rapidly vanishing.</p>
