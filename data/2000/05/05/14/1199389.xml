      <abstract>
        <p>Choreographer Diane Coburn Brunning hopes to attract public to summer project in which professional dancers, accompanied by live chamber music, will rehearse new works at Purchase College; first guest choreographer will be William Soleau (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The choreographer Diane Coburn Bruning has a radical notion -- to show the public the intimate act of dance making. In her view, the goofs in a rehearsal are as enlightening as the sudden inspirations because all are part of the creative process. Her Chamber Dance Project, which she hopes will become a summer staple, will allow plodding mortals to take vicarious wing by watching new works take shape.</p>
        <p>Dance is an uphill push in Westchester, but Ms. Bruning, who works with companies around the country, has rounded up PepsiCo and Fuji Photo Film U.S.A. as corporate sponsors. Three chamber musicians are on board to provide live music, and William Soleau is the first guest choreographer. ''I want a real commitment to dance and music as a collaborative art form,'' Ms. Bruning said. ''If you use canned music, then you don't have artists working together.''</p>

        <p>Dance is an uphill push in Westchester, but Ms. Bruning, who works with companies around the country, has rounded up PepsiCo and Fuji Photo Film U.S.A. as corporate sponsors. Three chamber musicians are on board to provide live music, and William Soleau is the first guest choreographer. ''I want a real commitment to dance and music as a collaborative art form,'' Ms. Bruning said. ''If you use canned music, then you don't have artists working together.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bruning, a Sleepy Hollow resident, makes contemporary ballets, which she defines as ''taking a 400-year-old technique and twisting it in new ways.'' Rehearsals will take place at Purchase College, where groups like the Carver Center in White Plains, a social service agency, will be among the first onlookers. A benefit concert on June 25 at Sleepy Hollow Country Club will mark the project's debut. For more information, the number to call is 332-7762.</p>
