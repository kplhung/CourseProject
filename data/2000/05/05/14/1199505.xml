        <p>A dash of positive economic news and strong quarterly earnings helped pull some stocks out of the dumps, but most investors remain fixated on the Federal Reserve.</p>
        <p>We had a nice rally at the end of the week, but the volume has been very light, said Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W. Baird &amp; Company in Milwaukee. The market is really on a Fed watch.</p>
        <p>Fed policy makers are expected to raise short-term interest rates by as much as half a percentage point when they meet on Tuesday. The central bank is concerned that the economy is growing too rapidly and that inflation will heat up.</p>
        <p>But economic data released last week gave some indication that the economy is slowing. The government reported that wholesale prices showed a 0.3 percent decline in April, reversing two months of increases, and that retail sales slowed in the same month.</p>
        <p>Blue-chip stocks posted gains, and many companies reported solid earnings, including Dell Computer.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week at 10,609.37, up 31.51 points. The Nasdaq composite index settled at 3,529.06, down 287.76</p>
