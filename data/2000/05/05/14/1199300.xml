        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Herbert Muschamp has the germ of a good idea when he links the portrayal of the hero in Ridley Scott's ''Gladiator'' to the glorification of the World War II veteran and the suburbanization of American cities [''Throwing Our Anxieties to the Lions,'' April 30]. As another child of the ''greatest generation'' (born in 1950 in Indiana), I find his cultural interpretation rather one-sided.</p>
        <p>Why revive the cliche, as Mr. Muschamp does, that the peace and normality of the suburbs are merely a facade for rigid gender and social hierarchies? The reality is much more complex. Suburban and family life after World War II were the source of major innovations in gender relations. Husbands and wives replaced notions of wifely obedience with ideals of companionship and respect. When families could, they supported the education of their daughters as well as their sons. As women's education and opportunities increased, ideals of personal freedom and equality for women grew deeper roots and became part of our everyday expectations.</p>

        <p>Why revive the cliche, as Mr. Muschamp does, that the peace and normality of the suburbs are merely a facade for rigid gender and social hierarchies? The reality is much more complex. Suburban and family life after World War II were the source of major innovations in gender relations. Husbands and wives replaced notions of wifely obedience with ideals of companionship and respect. When families could, they supported the education of their daughters as well as their sons. As women's education and opportunities increased, ideals of personal freedom and equality for women grew deeper roots and became part of our everyday expectations.</p>
        <p>As women's social influence has grown, the portrayal of even the most masculine of heroes has changed. The ideal man is the family man. He fights only out of necessity, and in service of his family. This new hero is everywhere. He was Braveheart. He is the hero in popular romance novels and a significant number of mysteries. He is even Mick Foley of the W.W.F. Most important, he is the idealized father of the ''Greatest Generation.'' It is no wonder to me that he is also the hero of ''Gladiator.''</p>
