        <p>A recorded message at (718) 553-8500 tells ticket holders to apply to their travel agencies for refunds. If tickets were bought directly from the airline with a credit card, ticket holders should request refunds from the card company on the ground that the trip could not be made. Correspondence can be sent to Tower Air, Hangar 17, J.F.K. International Airport, Jamaica, N.Y. 11430.</p>
