        <p>A growing docket and a dwindling pool of lawyers available to represent the poor have so crippled the New York City Family Court system that judges are forced to adjourn  cases repeatedly, children are forced to remain in foster care far longer than they ought to, and parents accused of child abuse are frequently denied their due process rights, according to a report to be released today by the city's public advocate, Mark Green.</p>
        <p>Lawyers and judges agree that the shortage of court-appointed counsel for the indigent, known as the 18-B panel, is driven chiefly by the low reimbursement rates. Since 1986, hourly fees have remained at $40 an hour for in-court services and $25 an hour for time preparing out of court. And while the shortage affects the entire state court system, in Family Court, the quality of legal representation -- and delays in getting any representation at all -- can profoundly disrupt children's lives. They can be separated from their parents, sometimes unjustifiably, for months.</p>

        <p>A growing docket and a dwindling pool of lawyers available to represent the poor have so crippled the New York City Family Court system that judges are forced to adjourn  cases repeatedly, children are forced to remain in foster care far longer than they ought to, and parents accused of child abuse are frequently denied their due process rights, according to a report to be released today by the city's public advocate, Mark Green.</p>
        <p>Lawyers and judges agree that the shortage of court-appointed counsel for the indigent, known as the 18-B panel, is driven chiefly by the low reimbursement rates. Since 1986, hourly fees have remained at $40 an hour for in-court services and $25 an hour for time preparing out of court. And while the shortage affects the entire state court system, in Family Court, the quality of legal representation -- and delays in getting any representation at all -- can profoundly disrupt children's lives. They can be separated from their parents, sometimes unjustifiably, for months.</p>
        <p>''In the current beleaguered system, everyone loses,'' the report reads. ''The parents suffer an injustice, the children languish in care, and the judicial process is sorely undermined.''</p>
        <p>The administrative judge of the city's Family Court, Joseph M. Lauria, said court officials had themselves drawn attention to the shortage of lawyers, although he added that he did not think due process was necessarily being violated. In addition, Judge Lauria noted, the chief judge of the state courts, Judith S. Kaye, has repeatedly pressed the governor and the Legislature to raise reimbursement rates to $75 an hour, to be paid for partly by criminal surcharge fees collected by the state.</p>
        <p>The report, titled ''Justice Denied: The Crisis in Legal Representation of Birth Parents in Child Welfare Proceedings,'' is the latest in a series of critical assessments of the Family Court.</p>
        <p>In January, a report by the Vera Institute of Justice, a nonprofit research institution, found that parents who used the Family Court most frequently complained about long waits -- an average of three hours in Manhattan before seeing a judge -- and about representation. Some lacked lawyers; others said their lawyers were either unhelpful or unavailable to meet with them about their cases.</p>
        <p>In March, the Special Child Welfare Advisory Panel, an independent group of experts charged by a federal court with investigating the Administration for Children's Services, turned its gaze to the Family Court, unexpectedly and to the chagrin of court officials. The panel was particularly critical of judges who, it said, frequently placed children in foster care even when the city child welfare officials failed to provide sufficient evidence of abuse and neglect.</p>
        <p>Mr. Green's report walks a delicate political line. It criticizes neither judges nor the quality of lawyers on the 18-B panel, and it takes pains to note how the lack of counsel can affect children, not just their parents.</p>
        <p>After all, as Mr. Green pointed out, it is politically difficult to advocate for lawyers who represent parents who are accused of child abuse. That is chief among the reasons, he said, why there has been such tepid political will in Albany to raise reimbursement rates for the panel.</p>
        <p>The report recommends raising reimbursement rates to $75 an hour.</p>
        <p>''There's no obvious political coalition or political capital to pay lawyers more money on behalf of parents who might be possible abusers,'' Mr. Green said. But, he added, ''the current system is not merely unfair to them. It also hurts kids who stay too long in undesirable foster care.  And it hurts taxpayers who spend too much for unnecessary foster care.''</p>
        <p>Mirroring national trends, the Family Court caseload in New York City has grown by a third in the last decade alone, according to the report. At the same time, the number of lawyers available to represent the poor has shrunk by 15 percent. Lawyers carry a load of up to 100 cases each. On days when there are no 18-B lawyers available in a particular courtroom, judges frequently dispatch their court officers to scour the building for a lawyer who may be free to take on a case.</p>
        <p>Every week, in each borough, 10 to 20 cases are adjourned because there are no lawyers available to represent a parent, the report states, citing an interview with Judge Lauria. On average, it can take six months before the court can determine if charges against a parent are substantiated.</p>
        <p>The scope of the problem of representation is suggested by the rare instances in which parents accused of child abuse win their cases: 1.6 percent of the time, according to the public advocate's report.</p>
        <p>''No one can know with certainty whether parents should prevail 20 percent or 50 percent of the time,'' Mr. Green said. ''But 1.6 percent is so stunningly low as to be a thermometer of the illness of the system.''</p>
