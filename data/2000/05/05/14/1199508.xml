        <p>Ford Motor Co holds annual meeting at Atlanta Zoo (S)</p>

        <p>Where does one of the nation's best-known smokestack companies hold its annual meeting when it wants to demonstrate a new commitment to the environment? Under Mr. Ford, an outspoken environmentalist, Ford Motor chose the Atlanta Zoo. Situated near Ford's Taurus assembly plant and heavily dependent on Ford  sponsorship for the last 15 years, the zoo had a large tent decorated like a jungle to show off prototype car models, while the platform for Mr. Ford and other company leaders was fringed with bamboo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ford announced his desire to make sport utilities safer and environmentally friendlier. But some of the futuristic models on display sent a different message. About 25 yards from the podium was a Ford Equator, an experimental vehicle with a short pickup bed, that is essentially an even wider version of the already substantial Ford Expedition. Ford officials say no decision has been made on whether to mass-produce the Equator.</p>
