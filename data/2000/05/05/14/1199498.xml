        <p>Looking a bit like a teenager forced to attend a classical music concert, Senator John McCain stood shoulder to shoulder with Gov. George W. Bush at a news conference on Tuesday in Pittsburgh.</p>
        <p>''I endorse Governor Bush, I endorse Governor Bush, I endorse Governor Bush,'' Mr. McCain intoned over and over, after a reporter asked why he seemed so reluctant to use the word.</p>
        <p>The repetition probably had the effect Mr. McCain intended: it reduced the term to ridiculousness. Still smarting over the negative turn that the primary campaign -- and some of Mr. Bush's commercials -- had taken, Mr. McCain had for weeks resisted falling into line behind the presumptive Republican nominee. When he finally did so last week, saying Mr. Bush had the ''vision, knowledge and expertise'' to be president -- and that he himself had no interest in being Mr. Bush's vice president -- there was a tight, grudging quality to the event.</p>
        <p>As if to confirm that the political and journalistic worlds have for months been hanging on Mr. McCain's every word, his utterance of that single word was the major political news of the week.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush seemed pleased to have gotten over that hump, but Vice President Al Gore reminded audiences that the two Republicans were not all that in sync. Speaking that same day in Washington to the Anti-Defamation League, Mr. Gore brought up an issue that divides Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain, the Confederate flag that flies over the South Carolina statehouse.</p>
        <p>''It is wrong to remain silent about it,'' Mr. Gore said, an allusion to Mr. Bush's deferring to the people of South Carolina on the issue. (Mr. McCain recently declared he had erred in not announcing earlier that he favors the flag's removal.)</p>
        <p>When it comes to politics, Mr. Gore's boss is not remaining silent, either. It was disclosed last week that President Clinton is serving as a behind-the-scenes adviser to many Democratic candidates across the country.</p>
        <p>''The guy can't live without a campaign in his life,'' Senator John Breaux of Louisiana said.</p>
