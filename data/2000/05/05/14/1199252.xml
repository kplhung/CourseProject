        <p>An exhibition focusing on the role of the horse in 3,000 years of Chinese history and culture is on display through Aug. 31 at the Kentucky Horse Park, in the Bluegrass region. The exhibition, ''Imperial China: The Art of the Horse in Chinese History,'' features more than 300 artifacts from museums in Shaanxi Province, including Xi'an, the ancient Chinese capital.</p>
        <p>The exhibit explores the significance of the horse in the unification of China, the exchange of equestrian culture with the West through the Silk Road, significant Chinese advances in horse accouterments and training, and the use of the horse in leisure activities. Each dynastic period from the Western Zhou (1027-771 B.C.) through the Qing (1644-1911) will be covered.</p>

        <p>An exhibition focusing on the role of the horse in 3,000 years of Chinese history and culture is on display through Aug. 31 at the Kentucky Horse Park, in the Bluegrass region. The exhibition, ''Imperial China: The Art of the Horse in Chinese History,'' features more than 300 artifacts from museums in Shaanxi Province, including Xi'an, the ancient Chinese capital.</p>
        <p>The exhibit explores the significance of the horse in the unification of China, the exchange of equestrian culture with the West through the Silk Road, significant Chinese advances in horse accouterments and training, and the use of the horse in leisure activities. Each dynastic period from the Western Zhou (1027-771 B.C.) through the Qing (1644-1911) will be covered.</p>
        <p>Among the artifacts are gold, porcelain and jade figures, bronze vessels, tricolored Tang dynasty ceramic statues, and a gold-  and silver-inlaid bronze Western Han Dynasty chariot, which was restored for the exhibit. Also included are 13 life-size figures from the famous terra-cotta army discovered about 25 years ago in the tomb of Qin Shi Huangdi, China's first emperor.</p>
        <p>Tickets for ''Imperial China'' are $16, $11 for ages 7 to 12; they will be issued for specific times and can be booked in advance. A taped audio tour is included in the price, as is admission to the 1,030-acre Kentucky Horse Park, a working farm and educational theme park that features more than 40 breeds of horses and two museums.</p>
        <p>The park is off I-75, four miles north of Lexington. Information: (800) 568-8813, or at www.kyhorsepark.com.</p>
