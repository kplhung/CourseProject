        <p>Officials in Westchester County, NY, celebrating 75th anniversary of Bronx River Parkway--America's first parkway--mount show of photographs at Bridge Gallery in White Plains (S)</p>

        <p>Take a roadway, weave it through 15 miles of greenery and what do you have? Landscape art, if it's the Bronx River Parkway. To celebrate the 75th anniversary of America's first parkway, the county has culled photographs from its archives and mounted them in a show at the Bridge Gallery in White Plains. This is a much loved highway, as passionately defended against the Philistines (anyone wanting to straighten or widen it) as any place in the county. Westchester also claims the parkway as the first ''linear park'' in the country.</p>
        <p>This album presents the roadway from preconception through its first nine years.  Here is its future site alongside the polluted Bronx River, where the wooden houses, factories and farms reveal life 100 years ago. (Some houses were moved to make way for the parkway, as a picture from 1915 shows.) There are Sunday painters with their easels, children playing hockey at Scarsdale Lake and a modern-looking baseball game in White Plains -- except the men watching wore suits and hats and the women wore long dresses on a July day.</p>

        <p>A 1922 car accident in Bronxville, and a sign posting the speed limit at 35 miles per hour (it is 40 m.p.h. now), make the past seem not so distant. Yet the 48 black-and-white photographs invite reveries. At the opening, George S. Latimer, chairman of the county's Board of Legislators, mused about the bygone faces. ''You realize there was a Westchester out there that was as alive as you and I are today,'' he said. ''It makes you aware that someday we won't be here -- that people will look back on the decisions we made, and no one will remember our names.''</p>
