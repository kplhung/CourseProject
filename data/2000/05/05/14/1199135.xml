        <p>THEY'VE been extinct for millions of years, but dinosaurs have managed to overcome that nagging little detail and are very much alive today in many forms of popular entertainment. Perhaps because they look somewhat familiar yet rather exotic and strange, dinosaurs have always held a particular fascination for many children. Whether in the form of giant skeletons in the natural history museum, digital re-creations lumbering through big-budget Hollywood films like ''Jurassic Park'' or yapping house pets on ''Flintstones'' reruns, dinosaurs can be kid magnets. And they have always looked as if they would be really good at stomping things, which for many children is the essence of cool.</p>
        <p>Not to be confused with the Disney summer movie ''Dinosaur,'' opening this week, ''Dinosaur!,'' by Peter Sis, is a wordless picture book about a little boy taking a bath with his plastic dinosaur toy. As the boy splashes about with his bath toy, he suddenly ''sees'' a real dinosaur peek its head up out of the bath water. Then a herd of assorted prehistoric species runs by, page after page, as the child imagines himself bathing in a dinosaur drinking pond. Using a color scheme primarily of greens and browns, Sis creates simple yet expressive illustrations with a mix of gouache paints, watercolors and pen-and-ink to capture the familiar sight of a young child lost in the joy of bath-time adventures.</p>
        <p>The dinosaurs in ''The Most Amazing Dinosaur,'' by the prolific James Stevenson, aren't quite as active as the imaginary ones in ''Dinosaur!'' For one thing, they're skeletons in a museum and serve mostly as background for the story of Wilfred the Rat. Bringing to mind rambling Ralph Mouse on his miniature plastic Harley in ''The Mouse and the Motorcycle,'' Beverly Cleary's timeless classic from 1965, Wilfred is first seen pedaling his bicycle through a snowstorm and looking for shelter.</p>
        <p>A stranger in town, Wilfred has no food, no friends and no place to stay for the night. He eventually finds safe haven by sneaking into a museum after hours and meets fellow squatters Pritchett the Owl, Harry the Snail, Leo the Squirrel and Buxton the Skunk. No humans reside in Stevenson's book, and the museum itself is run by Mr. Thrawl, who appears to be some sort of iguana-type creature clad in a purple pinstripe suit. The drawings, created with black pen and watercolors, have a sketchy, cartoonish feel that still manages to cram in a lot of detail across the pages.</p>
        <p>The story meanders a bit as Wilfred and his friends pass the winter roaming the museum and pilfering snacks from the cafeteria. But when they accidentally implode a large dinosaur skeleton just before the museum inspectors pay a visit to Mr. Thrawl, they all pitch in together to save the day -- and give the book its title.</p>
        <p>Dinosaurs turn up in museums in ''Dinosaurs Forever'' as well, but this time they're tourists, complete with cameras, guidebooks and loud Hawaiian shirts in Lynn Munsinger's hilarious but accurately detailed illustrations. The book is a collection of individual dinosaur tales and historical facts told in verse by William Wise, who manages to incorporate quite a challenging vocabulary into his aerobic rhyme schemes:</p>
        <p>Now, some Dinosaurs quarreled</p>
        <p>And some Dinosaurs fought,</p>
        <p>For a number were fierce</p>
        <p>and pugnacious,</p>
        <p>Though they lived with their peers,</p>
        <p>For millions of years,</p>
        <p>In Triassic -Jurassic -- Cretaceous!</p>
        <p>The dinosaurs in the book go to dinner, ballroom dances and college. Many of the popular, recognizable dinosaur species, like the Tyrannosaurus Rex and the Triceratops, get their own odes. A lesser-known species, the Deinonychus, which sported a sizable set of claws, also gets a page. In order to rhyme ''as swiftly as a zipper,'' the author has chosen the phrase ''an early Jack the Ripper'' to describe the beast's reputation, and the comparison to the legendary 19th-century London serial killer strikes a jarring, discordant note in the overall whimsical text. Although many youngsters may read right over the reference, there may be a few uncomfortable ''Daddy, who's Jack the Ripper?'' queries at bedtime. In general, however, the mix of Wise's creative couplets with Munsinger's comical watercolor and pen-and-ink creations makes ''Dinosaurs Forever'' fun to read.</p>
        <p>Another dinosaur-driven storybook that beautifully combines text and illustration is ''How Do Dinosaurs Say Good Night?'' Using the universal argument between parents and children about just exactly when it is time to go to bed, the book recasts stubborn children as full-sized dinosaurs whining, screaming, stalling and pouting as their human parents try to convince them that it's time for lights out. Jane Yolen's text is minimal but effective, and Mark Teague's exuberant paintings perfectly display all the traditional prepubescent posturing, from a Corythosaurus throwing itself across the bed in a hissy fit to the Trachodon begging for just one more book to be read aloud.</p>
        <p>With each type of dinosaur's name hidden somewhere on each page, the book is also an educational treasure hunt for kids just learning which dinosaur is which. And since it's all about hitting the sack, ''How Do Dinosaurs Say Good Night?'' makes a perfect bedtime book for the Brontosaurus-entranced child.</p>
