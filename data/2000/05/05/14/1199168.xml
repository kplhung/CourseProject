        <p>THE MAN WHO WROTE THE BOOK</p>
        <p>By Erik Tarloff.</p>
        <p>308 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Crown Publishers. $23.</p>
        <p>Poor, pitiful Ezra Gordon. At 35 he finds himself dead-ended as a literature professor at a small, suffocating Baptist college in California. He's bored, broke and mired in a frustrating relationship with the chaplain's daughter, who is either sexually frigid or hopelessly uninterested.</p>
        <p>Worse, a spurned student's phony harassment claim has put Ezra on shaky ground with the tenure committee, which has strongly encouraged him to publish something memorable soon or risk losing his job. Which, a morose Ezra realizes, is all he's got.</p>
        <p>A visit to the doctor confirms that while Ezra suffers from no ghastly terminal diseases, he is ''definitely on the back nine'' of life. Wildly depressed, he sets off for Los Angeles to visit an old grad-school chum, Isaac Schwimmer, who has become an immensely prosperous pornographer.</p>
        <p>''Wake up, pal,'' Isaac chides a shocked Ezra. ''It's a new millennium. The good books have all been published.'' Isaac, who is the most likable and bighearted smut peddler you'll ever meet, offers his friend $10,000 to write an X-rated novel for Schwimmer Press.</p>
        <p>Although desperately in need of cash, Ezra balks, citing his limited and mostly conventional experiences with sex. Isaac solves the problem by hooking him up with Tessa, a gorgeous and worldly Penthouse magazine model. Within days, Ezra is novelizing like a man possessed, which of course he is: ''Strange how much pleasure he'd found in writing a stupid little dirty book; it had actually reawakened his joy in literature, reminded him why he'd gone to graduate school in the first place.''</p>
        <p>The improbability of the eye-popping Tessa falling for ordinary Ezra is one of the charms of ''The Man Who Wrote the Book,'' Erik Tarloff's second novel (the first was the well-received ''Face-Time''). Tessa, fed up with L.A. and the soft-porn grind, adores the tranquil campus life back at sleepy Beuhler College.</p>
        <p>Ezra himself can't believe such a creature as Tessa could be attracted to him, and his disbelief is so endearingly stoic and unshakable that we somehow end up buying the whole red-hot affair. It's a neat trick.</p>
        <p>More predictable is the fate of Ezra's carnal epic, ''Every Inch a Lady,'' which he cranks out in 16 sweaty days and delivers under the heretical pseudonym of E. A. Peau. It becomes a runaway best seller, naturally, complete with a front-page review in this very publication by none other than John Updike.</p>
        <p>Ezra is by turns giddy at his unexpected success and wretched in his anonymity. Meanwhile, a tabloid newspaper traces the postmark on the book's manuscript to Beuhler College, which is pitched into scandal. A search is begun to unmask and punish the real E. A. Peau, and Ezra quakes as the noose seems to tighten.</p>
        <p>Readers will wonder why he simply doesn't quit his dreary faculty gig and go off to make millions writing more dirty books. The answer is as old as the written word: writer's block. Ezra is one tapped-out pornmeister: ''If only he were able to write . . . that would almost qualify as deliverance. But it was also a pipe dream. He'd had one lovely, fluky success, but laborious effort had failed to produce anything further. Even produce something bad.''</p>
        <p>The plot's payoff is fun, though not especially nimble. Tarloff's greater strength is his characters, who are full of surprises. The best is Carol, the chaplain's daughter, who evolves mysteriously from prude to siren, ultimately shattering Ezra's long-held notions about the nature of lust.</p>
        <p>As for the dreamy, wistful Tessa, she lingers only long enough to tease and promise more. Her exit, however abrupt, was probably necessary so that Ezra, and Tarloff, could buckle down and finish their books.</p>
