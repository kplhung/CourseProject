        <p>Three New Yorkers recently changed careers, revived a 40-year-old Upper East Side florist and in doing so, came up with a twist. They opened Euforia Cafe at 167 West 83rd Street, where they sell flower designs under the name of the old business, Enchanted Garden, as well as smoothies, blended fresh-fruit drinks.</p>
        <p>''People come in trying to figure out what the space is,'' said Jeff Lee, an owner. Both names are written on the green awning, and two sets of business cards are placed near the door.</p>
        <p>''A lot of people don't know that Enchanted Garden is actually a business,'' said Tohru Takashima, another owner. ''They thought we actually had an enchanted garden.''</p>
        <p>White lilies, lavender orchids and white lisianthus line well-lighted  shelves. On the opposite side, bananas, strawberries and mangos are piled in the smoothie area. ''You have the smells from the fruits, you have the smells from the flowers,'' Mr. Lee said. ''All of the inventory's actually decorative for the space.''</p>
        <p>The owners -- Mr. Lee, Mr. Takashima and Masa Yamazaki -- are friends who left jobs in research analysis, three-dimensional animation and investment banking to take over the Enchanted Garden a little over a year ago. The shop was on East 86th Street at the time, but the partners decided to move west for a location with a backyard.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yamazaki said that, in Manhattan, flowers are an impulse purchase, typically sold on busy avenues, so they needed ''to get people to come in.''</p>
        <p>They virtually closed down walk-in business for seven or eight months, gutted the store and created a clean, minimalist look. As people fond of cooking (two of the owners used to have cook-offs to settle who was the  better chef), they thought of smoothies and began experimenting with exotic fruit in mixing their own combinations.</p>
        <p>They are still getting used to the possibilities of a two-in-one business.  Some customers who call in orders for bouquets are also asking for cappuccinos or smoothies.</p>
