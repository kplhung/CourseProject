        <p>ON a visit last week to the Swarovski Creative Services Center, the Austrian crystal maker's new showroom on West 57th Street, the fashion designer Victor Costa glanced at a pink chiffon Versace evening dress.

        <p>ON a visit last week to the Swarovski Creative Services Center, the Austrian crystal maker's new showroom on West 57th Street, the fashion designer Victor Costa glanced at a pink chiffon Versace evening dress. Patterned with palm leaves and encrusted with crystals, the dress was to go on display in an exhibition organized by D. Swarovski &amp;  Company to mark the showroom's opening on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>A man with an eye for the splashy effect, Mr. Costa envisioned it in a more lustrous setting. Turning to Nadja Swarovski, a fifth-generation member of the family business, he teased, ''Are you going to wear it to your party?''</p>
        <p>Ms. Swarovski, who was planning to celebrate her 30th birthday with friends that night at Cipriani, laughed on cue, but her mind was plainly elsewhere. ''You always imagine,'' she finally said, ''that by the time you reach 30 you have done this, you will have done that.''</p>
        <p>She trailed off, leaving unspoken a catalog of regrets. For the youngest, liveliest, most visible and certainly hippest member of a formerly insular Old World family, her pensive tone seemed out of character.</p>
        <p>Since joining the company in New York five years ago, Ms. Swarovski has been its most ebullient cheerleader, assigning herself the task of drastically expanding its fashion profile, while at the same time raising her own.</p>
        <p>There was a time when the name Swarovski brought to mind those twinkling menageries of crystal swans and polar bears, mice and butterflies sold in Times Square and at airport duty-free shops. These days, in large part thanks to Ms. Swarovski, it trips off the tongues of young socialites, Seventh Avenue designers and those haughty vendeuses who cater to the carriage trade, few of whom can say ''Swarovski'' without a rapturous catch in their breath.</p>
        <p>Polly Mellen, the former creative director of Allure magazine, is among the style-struck. ''These stones are tactile, they're glamorous, that's what they are,'' Ms. Mellen cooed. ''When you use them on a dress, they are the jewels. You don't need anything else.''</p>
        <p>In the fashion community, where a glossy veneer is vital to survival, Ms. Swarovski was instrumental in buffing the company's image, creating the perception that its gemstone look-alikes, made of intricately cut glass, might have spilled from the Habsburg royal coffers.</p>
        <p>When she arrived at the company's New York offices in 1995, after a childhood in Austria and a degree from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, the family business stood, in her mind, for everything staid and uptight. Ms. Swarovski termed it ''terribly conservative.'' Its chief products were decorative objects and industrial components like road-safety reflectors and optical instruments. A global business, in 1998 it had $1.2 billion in sales, the most recent figure available.</p>
        <p>Determined to bring luster to the brand, Ms. Swarovski worked at courting the most illustrious names in fashion, including Versace, Dolce &amp; Gabbana and Alexander McQueen, and persuading those designers to use the company's shimmery stones to embellish everything from shoes to hats to evening gowns. Her timing couldn't have been luckier: as minimalism waned as a fashion trend, it was replaced by its opposite, with an impulse to dazzle with color, beading and, in many cases, crystals sewn or clamped to garments.</p>
        <p>Soon, Swarovski crystals were adorning outfits on catwalks from Milan to New York, and the name was mentioned prominently in picture captions for those garments in fashion magazines.</p>
        <p>One of Ms. Swarovski's former employers, Matthew Evins, a New York fashion publicist, said, ''She has taken the mass out of what was seen as a mass product and positioned it as a luxury brand.''</p>
        <p>The company was not above pressuring fashion editors to feature its products (from high-end Daniel Swarovski evening bags to crystal mesh and body jewelry) in exchange for its advertising.</p>
        <p>''They were quite aggressive,'' recalled Lucy Wallace, who worked as an accessories editor at several fashion magazines, including Harper's Bazaar and Elle, during the late 90's when Swarovski was struggling to raise its fashion profile. ''I think they understood that one hand washes the other. I was aware to always be good to them at all the books.''</p>
        <p>Another accessories editor explained in detail how that works: her publisher, in pursuit of Swarovski's ads, asks editors to feature its products in layouts, including handbags and costume jewelry, and to mention the company name in captions describing designers' beaded dresses.</p>
        <p>Ms. Swarovski has also pursued another front in her image-building campaign: promoting the family name and its wares at gala fund-raisers. In the last several years, she has been an eye-catching fixture at New York parties, serving on the benefit committees for the Asia Society, Save Venice and the Whitney Museum. Her name has also appeared on the invitations to other galas, including the reopening of the Hayden Planetarium, for which she said she did no work -- a sure sign of having arrived socially.</p>
        <p>Ms. Swarovski is a flamboyant person, given to wearing plumes in her hair and dancing on tabletops, as she did in March at the Save Venice ball, a six-foot feather boa cascading down her crystal-beaded dress.</p>
        <p>Her pursuit of designers and her personal ubiquity seem to have paid off. Irenka Jakubiak, editor in chief of Accessories magazine, an industry monthly, said, ''Under her direction, Swarovski has contributed strongly to a revival of the accessories business.''</p>
        <p>Paul Morton, a vice president of sales for Swarovski, said, ''Nadja has certainly played an active role in further expanding the awareness of Swarovski in the design community.'' Ten years ago, Baccarat, the crystal maker, where Mr. Morton was then employed, commissioned a consumer-awareness survey. ''At that point,'' he recalled, ''as a recognized brand among the U.S. population, Swarovski barely registered.'' It may have had 2 or 3 percent of the market, he said. In a similar survey commissioned last year by Swarovski, that figure had jumped to 27 percent. ''We nearly fell out of our chairs,'' Mr. Morton recalled.</p>
        <p>But in struggling to repackage the company, and refashion herself, Ms. Swarovski has raised a few eyebrows. Single-minded as she is when it comes to promoting the business, she also likes a good time, bringing to mind the young Diane Von Furstenberg, who made her name in the 1970's peddling dresses out of a suitcase by day, mingling with the beautiful people by night. Unlike that designer, who married a prince, Ms. Swarovski has no ''von'' in her name.</p>
        <p>The great-great-granddaughter of Daniel Swarovski, a poor Bohemian stonecutter who founded the company in 1895, Ms. Swarovski grew up in Wattens in the Austrian Tirol, where the business is headquartered. She studied art history in Texas and worked in New York as a trainee at Sotheby's, as an assistant to the art dealer Larry Gagosian and as a fashion publicist before joining the family business.</p>
        <p>She is one of a new breed of young socialites, including Aerin Lauder Zinterhofer and Tiffany Dubin, who think nothing of marrying good works with commercial interests. She has harvested the resentment of a segment of Manhattan's old guard, which perceives her as a promoter.  Conceding that Ms. Swarovski has managed to penetrate a circle once as airtight as a pickling jar, a former debutante who worked with Ms. Swarovski on several benefit committees observed: ''This world has changed so much. In the old days membership on a benefit committee was conferred through a screening process. It was about your parents, about people you went to school with. You came up through the ranks.''</p>
        <p>''Now,'' she added gloomily, ''it's all about publicity. What happened in Hollywood had to come here.''</p>
        <p>But Ms. Swarovski makes no apology for borrowing a Hollywood publicist's techniques. The company has lately joined a parade of luxury goods makers, including Gucci, Prada and Harry Winston, that have enlisted celebrities to wear their pricey goods at well-publicized events. For the Oscars, Swarovski collaborated with the shoemaker Jimmy Choo to create crystal-embellished evening pumps and sandals for Hilary Swank and others. This week, Ms. Swarovski is off to Cannes to persuade other stars to wear Swarovski at the film festival.</p>
        <p>At Save Venice's recent Marco Polo ball, which Swarovski sponsored with Escada for a joint contribution of $15,000, Ms. Swarovski invited designers like Richard Tyler, Narciso Rodriguez and Mary McFadden to create crystal-adorned masks for the event.</p>
        <p>Yet, she shrugs off assertions that she has contaminated junior society with commercialism. ''I hear that, but I don't care,'' she said evenly, hinting that since she arrived in New York, that sort of sniping has been the least of her troubles.</p>
        <p>''Even within the company, I had to push so many mountains, push open so many doors,'' she said. Ms. Swarovski is nothing if not intense, shifting to the edge of her chair as she speaks, eyes wide as plates and fogging with emotion.</p>
        <p>Her initial efforts to shake the company out of a certain complacency met with internal resistance, she said. When she first suggested opening a showroom where designers can examine loose crystals and see fashions others have adorned with them, ''people laughed at me,'' she said. But today, the new Creative Services Center, designed at a cost of about $750,000, is the latest in a string of such showrooms that by summer will stretch from Milan, London and Paris to New Delhi. Ms. Swarovski will manage the New York center.</p>
        <p>She encountered the same in-house skepticism when she suggested hiring the British fashion muse Isabella Blow as a design consultant. Karl-Heinz Rampold, director of the Swarovski showrooms worldwide, acknowledged that hiring Ms. Blow, whom he regarded as an extreme eccentric, seemed a stretch at first. ''A company that concentrated a great deal on industrial products in its first century might not have understood the mission of such a person,'' he said. This changed, however, under Ms. Swarovski's perseverance. And in the late 90's, Ms. Blow, working for the company, began encouraging friends of hers like Mr.  McQueen and Vivienne Westwood to add crystals to evening dresses. Once those fashion incendiaries led the way, other designers followed.</p>
        <p>Before long, even Michael Kors and Mr. Rodriguez, who dress a more conservative crowd, were lining up for the company's shimmering stones. Mr. Rodriguez, who unveiled a procession of crystal-spattered coats and dresses in his spring 2000 collection for Loewe, said the crystals catapulted the price of a $2,400 leather coat to $15,000.</p>
        <p>Nor is Ms. Swarovski much surprised. Satisfied that she has succeeded in restoring to Swarovski a cachet it hasn't had since her grandfather supplied crystals for Christian Dior, she guides a visitor to a glass case in her new showroom. Propped on a satin cushion inside were a pair of crystal-studded earrings the Duchess of Windsor once wore. When she saw them in a recent Sotheby's auction catalog, with her family's crystals credited, Ms. Swarovski was over the moon. ''That was the moment,'' she recalled, ''when I knew we had finally arrived.''</p>
