        <p>To many Americans, the stock market boom has been like a solitary breeze on a torrid summer night: just when they turn to enjoy the coolness, it seems to go away.</p>
        <p>Two-thirds of Americans who responded to a survey about their retirement plans said they had not gained substantially from the decadelong bull market.</p>
        <p>Six hundred people over the age of 25 took part in the poll, which was commissioned by the Keyport Life Insurance Company in Boston. Of the respondents,  278 were working and 322 were retired.</p>
        <p>Of the current workers, only 10 percent said their stock market gains would allow them to retire early; 3 percent of the retired respondents said such gains had let them retire early.</p>
        <p>Keyport, which conducted a similar survey in 1995, found contradictory attitudes and expectations about retirement needs and lifestyles. Three-fourths of the current workers said their standard of living in retirement would be the same or higher than it was now, but just over half could not estimate how much money they would need to retire in the lifestyle they wanted. That was up from 43 percent in 1995.</p>
        <p>Among the current workers who listed an amount, the median was $400,000, but 26 percent said they would need less than $100,000.</p>
        <p>''This lack of financial realism is very disturbing,'' said Philip K. Polkinghorn, president of Keyport. ''Financial planners and other experts that take inflation, life span and other factors into account when setting retirement savings goals would find that $100,000 is only a fraction of what an individual needs as a retirement nest egg.''</p>
        <p>He said $400,000 was more realistic.</p>
        <p>The survey found that half of current workers expected to be working for pay in retirement; 56 percent of those said they would need the money. By contrast, 22  percent of the retirees said they were working part-time now, up from 13 percent in 1995.</p>
        <p>Only 23 percent of current workers expect Social Security to be a major source of retirement income, down from 35 percent in 1995. Most expect the majority of retirement income to come from 401(k)'s, individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans.</p>
