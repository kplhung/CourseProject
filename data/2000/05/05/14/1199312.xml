        <p>EIGHT major events.</p>
        <p>Fifteen days.</p>
        <p>Thousands of workers.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of thousands of participants.</p>
        <p>That's summer in Red Bank.</p>
        <p>Anyone who has ever planned a party for two dozen or a wedding for 200 knows how mind-boggling the details can be. Multiply that by thousands and you would still not have a handle on what it takes to put together the summer events in Red Bank, where the season started with the Pipes and Drums of the Atlantic Watch last weekend and runs through Sept. 16 and the Stroll for Strays, sponsored by the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.</p>
        <p>Some of the events in between routinely draw as many as 150,000 people to Marine Park along the Navesink River in this central New Jersey borough, which has 11,000 permanent residents and a downtown made up of only two major intersecting streets.</p>
        <p>It also has a reputation, developed over the last decade, as one of the ''hippest'' and most interesting places to live in New Jersey. At least part of the credit for that goes to the borough's special events committee, a group of municipal officials whose job it is to smooth the way for anyone given permission to hold a summer event in Red Bank.</p>
        <p>''The borough does not sponsor these events, but we don't give just anyone permission to hold one either,'' said Stanley J. Sickels, Red Bank administrator. ''We don't want to overburden the town. We want to have time for everyone, including the residents, to recuperate between events.''</p>
        <p>The special events committee was created shortly after Mayor Edward J. McKenna Jr. took office in 1991 and is made up of representatives from each borough department with a hand in any event within the borough borders, like the police, public works, the electrical inspector, emergency management and the health inspector.</p>
        <p>It takes year-round planning to stage any of the events, from those that last a few hours like the dog walk or fireworks, to the three-day music and food extravaganza that the Riverfest has become.</p>
        <p>''When one Riverfest ends, we start planning the next one,'' said Deanna Hunt, event manager for This Is It! Productions in Hoboken, which helps put the event together. ''As soon as it is over we start looking at what we can add next year to make it better. This year we added a stage for acoustic music. We have 24 area restaurants showing off their best dishes. Each restaurant has maybe a dozen people on site and that does not include the people needed to prep the food.''</p>
        <p>While visitors see only the end product, those who stage the events have to deal with stacks of permission slips, insurance forms and safety instructions before they can begin to welcome anyone to Marine Park.</p>
        <p>The Red Bank Construction Office has 17 requirements for portable propane tanks alone, including having ''one approved wet chemical type portable fire extinguisher for every three deep fat fryers in use.'' ''Dial stem thermometers'' must be available to insure that hot foods are kept at 140 degrees or higher and cold food at 45 degrees or lower.</p>
        <p>Liability insurance has to be purchased, a borough food vendor's license must be obtained, and arrangements have to be made for traffic and parking.</p>
        <p>That's just the beginning. There are pages and pages of instructions to read and questions to answer. But Red Bank has managed to put everything together into one package.</p>
        <p>''If anybody wants to have an event, Red Bank is the place to do it,'' said Ernie Lackey, director of games for the Pipes and Drums of the Atlantic Watch, which sponsors two days of Celtic music and competitions held last weekend.</p>
        <p>''We have 400 to 500 pipers and drummers at the Count Basie Sports Field, where we also have Highland dancing and athletic events,'' Mr. Lackey said. ''We talked to a lot of mayors before we picked a town, and Red Bank acted like they really wanted us. In turn, we march in their parades. The borough loans us their buses to shuttle people from the train station and from remote parking lots; we pay the drivers and buy the insurance.</p>
        <p>''The support we get is unreal,'' he added. ''If we have a question about the health codes, the head of the health department is right there to answer them.''</p>
        <p>Some events are held in Red Bank because there is a connection to the borough, like the George Sheehan Classic, which attracts 4,000 on the first Saturday in August for a children's event, a two-mile health walk and a five-mile running race. The late George Sheehan, a well-known local runner, was a doctor who practiced out of Riverview Medical Center in Red Bank. While the race does not require as many volunteers to pull it off as it has runners, the numbers are close.</p>
        <p>A five-person board of directors meets regularly year round to set policy and a 30-person committee starts meeting monthly in midwinter to solicit sponsors and begin planning the logistics.</p>
        <p>''We recruit community groups such as the Boy Scouts to help,'' said Bob Rosa, the race director. ''We give T-shirts to the volunteers and we always give out 1,000. You have to have water stops and bathrooms and bagels at the end of the race.''</p>
        <p>In August, when the race is done, a debriefing session is held with the Red Bank special events committee.</p>
        <p>''We inventory our supplies, put everything in the warehouse and start soliciting sponsors,'' Mr. Rosa said. ''The planning never stops. Our commitment to the towns is that one hour after the race is over you can't tell we were ever there.''</p>
        <p>One event that used to be sponsored by the borough, the fireworks set off on July 3 each year to avoid conflicting with New York City's display, has now been taken over by a private committee made up mostly of residents and borough merchants. Billed as the largest in New Jersey, the 30-minute display costs $110,000, much of it raised from private donations of $5 and $10, and attracts an audience of 150,000, said John Sharp, one of the chairmen of the planning committees.</p>
        <p>Some of the people involved are obviously needed. Engineers are necessary to locate the fireworks barge in the Navesink River, and workers from Fireworks by Grucci on Long Island must set up the display. Every police officer in the borough works that night to help close streets and direct traffic that can take two hours to clear afterward.</p>
        <p>''But there are also firemen who sit on a fire truck in a parking lot somewhere just in case there is a fire, Mr. Sharp said, ''and there are the first-aid squad members stationed around town because the fire houses and roads to the hospital are blocked and we have to be able to get help to people if they need it.''</p>
        <p>Other events involve private citizens who end up getting involved in the planning almost by accident.</p>
        <p>An interest in classic cars turned Dr. James Dubel, a chiropractor from neighboring Shrewsbury, into the founder of next weekend's Cruisin' With Oldies Weekend. The event started a decade ago when Dr. Dubel thought he and some friends would like to show off their antique cars by parking then on the street in Red Bank. From there, the idea grew, and grew some more.</p>
        <p>Now 100,000 people come to see the hundreds of old cars, eat the food and listen to the bands that perform in Marine Park that weekend. Dr. Dubel's wife, Barbara, has taken over much of the organizing with the help of a 10-member committee.</p>
        <p>''Somebody has to find places for the band members to stay, make sure the stages and sound systems are in place, rent a trolley that shuttles people around town for free, get volunteers to park the antique cars and a million other details,'' Dr. Dubel said. ''Luckily the borough helps by telling us where to put the fences, where the electric lines should go, and how many police we need on a given corner. I don't know those kinds of things. We pay for everything and the profits go to a charity -- and somebody has to pick the charity.''</p>
        <p>Charity events like the Stroll for Strays, which lets people walk their dogs and raise money for the S.P.C.A., also need volunteers to deal with the details.</p>
        <p>''The local Girl Scouts make the pooper bags for us, then someone has to give them out to the dog walkers,'' said Ursula Goetz, Monmouth County S.P.C.A.'s executive director. ''We need water stops for the animals and the walkers and veterinarians to make sure no animals become stressed. Then we have a team walk the area afterward to make sure every thing is clean.''</p>
        <p>Then there are the line-dance lessons, jazz concerts and movies in the park that are still sponsored by the borough and planned by staff members of the parks and recreation department, although much of the cost is borne by sponsors.</p>
        <p>Before any of the events actually hit the streets, the borough has a media day in a local hotel where each event's organizers can set up a booth to show what they have planned in order to attract sponsors and media attention.</p>
        <p>''I think everything runs smoothly because every department involved is in the same room planning with the event organizers al year,'' Mr. Sickels said. ''At each special events meeting, the sponsor of each event has a chance to go over the details and after the event there is a post-mortem. It becomes part of the community and is part of the reason Red Bank has developed a good reputation.''</p>
