        <p>We stood fidgeting at the edge of the trail, acting more like schoolchildren than seasoned travelers. The advance man for the royal party came bouncing down the path carrying a walkie-talkie. A redstart -- a crimson and black bird with white cap -- landed on a farmhouse roof, gave three flicks of its tail and, as if on cue, the king, Jigme Singye Wangchuck, rounded the bend, nattily turned out in a silver gray gho -- a traditional belted knee-length robe -- long socks and white sneakers. He stopped to shake each of our hands and, in perfect English, inquired where we were from and where we were going. He had been camped at the base of Mount Jumolhari on a fishing vacation with three of his four wives, one of whom also stopped to say hello. The other two, on tiny horses with red saddles, smiled their greetings.</p>
        <p>Of course, not every visitor to Bhutan meets the king, as we did, but it's the kind of thing that can happen in this small country (about the size of Switzerland) that occupies the southeastern slopes of the Himalayas. To Western eyes Bhutan can seem like a precious relic from a lost century. It is underpopulated -- some estimates are as low as 600,000 people -- and heavily forested. Most Bhutanese own and work small farms.</p>
        <p>Automobiles are rare; much of the country is connected only by walking trails. As in medieval Europe, religion permeates Bhutan, the last remaining independent Buddhist kingdom in the Himalayas. Twelve-foot-tall prayer flags flutter on lonely ridges. Small temples called chortens squat beside trails and settlements. Austere dzongs, fortress-monasteries, preside over deep valleys.</p>
        <p>In our group there were three besides my husband, Mike, and me: our friends Marilyn and Leigh Stowell of Jackson Hole, Wyo., and John Van Dyke, from Seattle. We chose to travel by foot where no roads go. Our mission, undertaken in late September, right after the official end of the monsoon season, was to explore the northwest area of Bhutan, much of it covered by Jigme Dorji National Park, home to such endangered species as blue sheep, red panda, snow leopard and takin -- a large-bodied, short-legged ruminant with a bulbous nose. Starting from Paro, the town where the international airport is located, we would walk 13 days and rest 3, crossing high mountain passes near the Tibetan border and descending to a spot where a van would pick us up and take us to Thimphu, the capital, then back to Paro. Guides and a cook would make camp for us; mules, horses -- and in high altitude, yaks -- would carry baggage.</p>
        <p>Marilyn and Leigh, who had been to Bhutan twice before, made arrangements through their Bhutanese friend and tour operator, Passang Tshering. Passang, a tall man in his early 40's, met Mike and me at the airport with a driver and late-model Toyota van. On the short trip to our hotel, the Olathang, above Paro, I was charmed by the landscape. Cosmos in every shade of pink bordered fields of red rice. Pagodalike roofs appeared to float over timber-and-white farmhouses decorated with Buddhist motifs.</p>
        <p>Red chilies were spread on roofs to dry, foretelling the fiery sauce we would soon come to crave, even on eggs in the morning.</p>
        <p>Marilyn and Leigh joined us later that day; John would fly in the next.</p>
        <p>While we were waiting, we had our first fortunate encounter. Passang took us to a ruined dzong outside town. On the path we passed a farmhouse. Through open windows we could hear low horns, drums and chanting. Before I knew it we were climbing a ladder to the second story (the first floor was reserved for animals). Women were cooking at a large wood stove in washtub-size pots. Like most Bhutanese farmhouses, this one had no chimney.</p>
        <p>Smoke wafted through the room and out open windows. Sitting on the floor in a corner, a man was hacking raw meat from a bone.</p>
        <p>We took off our shoes and filed into the next room. One wall was devoted to a colorful Buddhist shrine with yak-butter lamps and copper bowls of water as offerings. Another was filled with narrow books of scripture that had been rescued from the dzong when it burned years before. Seated on the floor, a monk in red robes and four men were chanting from Sanskrit texts.</p>
        <p>Two would blow the seven-foot-long metal horns. One kept time on cymbals and a pedestal drum. Another picked up a horn made from a human thighbone and blew a harsh wild note.</p>
        <p>The men took a break for tea. Passang said they would chant for two days as part of a harvest festival. We sat on the floor, drank cups of salty tea with yak butter and nibbled the flaky uncooked newly harvested rice.</p>
        <p>It was our first farmhouse but by no means our last. We would sometimes take shelter in houses to eat our packed lunch. The guides would offer our hosts small gratuities, but on the trail, where there are no inns, it is accepted that a traveler can join a household for a meal, or even overnight.</p>
        <p>The day we began our trek, it was raining. We ransacked the small general stores of Paro for folding umbrellas, which would turn out to be valuable purchases. Our van took us out of town, where 14 little mules were looking damp and dismal as they received the burdens of our packs. Passang, who had an injured knee, was entrusting us to his nephews: 23-year-old Phub (pronounced Pope) Tshering, a veteran of seven years of trekking, and 18-year-old Namgay Tshering, who had been pulled out of computer school for this, his first trek. Also along was a cook, Palden Dorjee, a slight, quiet man of 30, and Jigme, a short, stalwart 53-year-old, whose steady strength we would call on in some dark days to come.</p>
        <p>But that time was far ahead of us. We set out, using umbrellas like balancing parasols, between rice paddies and fields of bright pink turnips, following the Paro Chhu (chhu means ''river'') upstream. We reached camp, Shama Zampa, before 5 p.m., where we found three snug North Face tents set up for us, with air mattresses inside. While we were changing into dry clothes, Namgay served us tea and cookies in our tents. Around 7 we were called to dinner in the kitchen tent, which was big enough to stand in. Phub was glad we had brought our own chairs -air mattresses with slings to form seats and backs -- as their aluminum frame chairs had met with some mishap involving the mules. Leigh had warned us to expect little more than rice and lentil sauce for dinner, so we were amazed at the feast before us, all cooked over a propane stove: vegetable cream soup, rosy Bhutanese rice, carrots in cheese sauce, greens with fresh ginger, beef stewed with turnips, chicken masala, hot spiced canned tuna. Dessert was fruit cocktail in a warm custard sauce. Although Leigh cautioned that variety would suffer as we traveled into high remote country, if anything, meals became more inventive. Palden made Indian breads and homemade potato chips, and he found yak meat and dried Tibetan fish when the meat ran out. There were always fresh vegetables.</p>
        <p>The next day Phub wanted to start early since we had to cover more than 13 miles and gain 1,500 feet in altitude. Namgay brought tea to our tents at 6:30, along with a basin of hot water for washing. By 7:15 we were putting away oatmeal with raisins, eggs and toast. Although there was tea, Nescafe and cocoa mix, we made filtered coffee with supplies brought from home. Then came word that we would have to wait until the king passed by at 9 o'clock. We, of course, were perfectly delighted. At that point only Phub, who knew that the trail was muddy and rocky, and that darkness would fall promptly at 6:30 p.m., had misgivings.</p>
        <p>After the king had gone, we retraced his route upriver. Women were still outside their houses, wearing their best kiras, the traditional floor-length dresses they had put on in the king's honor. Footing was treacherous. I stopped once in a while to look at water crashing over boulders or at giant trees hung with ferns and lichen like bright green streamers. At one point, Mike and I noticed with relief that the way had gotten drier. Phub came running up to call us back: we had veered off onto the trail to Tibet. (For the entire trek we saw absolutely no direction signs.) It was rainy and dark when we dragged into Thangthangk.</p>
        <p>We woke to sun and a view of Mount Jumolhari. Although we were at about 12,000 feet, the sacred peak, at some 24,000 feet, loomed over us, a perfect cone gleaming with fresh snow. Yesterday, Phub had talked to porters on the trail who had been turned back by heavy snow at a high pass we were scheduled to cross in less than a week. We had planned our trek close to the end of the monsoon (which didn't seem to be ending quite on schedule) to avoid later snows, but in the mountains weather is always chancy. Deciduous trees gave way to twisted junipers as we climbed out of the narrow valley into high country. A yak herder's house, with looping ropes of grass hanging to dry from outside eaves, was our stop for lunch. When Leigh saw our hostess, he recognized her from 12 years earlier.</p>
        <p>She remembered that he had bought a pair of red tassels for yak's ears, and offered him a braided black-and-white yak-hair rope, which Leigh could not resist. John purchased a brass bell on a leather harness that was hanging from the rafters. I wondered if this woman, who lives without electricity and is snowed in from November to March, assumed that we were buying these items for our yaks.</p>
        <p>Jangothang campground, at the base of Jumolhari, was impossibly picturesque. Ringed by high peaks, with a ruined stone fort as a backdrop and mountain streams crashing on either side, it didn't even need the rainbow that greeted us. We took tea outside our tents, watching the mist reveal one part of Jumolhari and then another. A flock of snow pigeons flashed white against the sky.</p>
        <p>Our first rest day began with a picnic breakfast, then washing muddy clothes in a stream. Namgay, Marilyn, Leigh and I crossed the river and climbed to a broad basin with lakes. As we came into the valley, suddenly Jichu Drake appeared, a pyramid of snow next to Jumolarhi. Yaks grazed on either side of the path. Huge marmots stood beside their burrows and whistled warnings. Blue gentians were everywhere. We were nearing the first lake when Namgay spotted a herd of about 100 blue sheep heading for the hills. Their markings, in tan, white and a slate gray that might be called blue, rendered them almost invisible against the rocky slope. We watched them through binoculars as we ate sandwiches in a roofless stone yak herder's shelter.</p>
        <p>Now that we were going into country too high for the mules, yaks would be carrying our equipment.</p>
        <p>These shaggy, oxlike, horned beasts are as nimble as goats in steep terrain but cannot survive below 10,000 feet. We left camp right after breakfast and did not meet our yaks until we were lunching on hot fried rice and curried eggplant, sitting just down from our first high pass: Nyile La (la means ''pass''), at about 14,000 feet.</p>
        <p>The head yak, decked in red ear tassels and headpiece, came thundering over the ridge, bucking and hopping and shaking his packs. He worked them over his head and they went bouncing down the slope. Even the yak drivers were laughing at the show. The yak, which we named Fluffy, was eventually subdued and persuaded to accept the packs again. For the rest of the trip he remained docile, if a trifle sullen.</p>
        <p>Coming down, we were overwhelmed with a richness of scenery. Behind us were the glacier fields of Jichu Drake. Below were steep-cut valleys. We passed herders' black yak-hair tents and looked across thousand-foot gorges to deep green rhododendron forests. Shortly after 3 p.m., we spotted our tents set up in the Lingzhi basin, an area noted for its wild medicinal herbs.</p>
        <p>For the next five days we hiked and camped at about 13,000 feet and above. We moved slowly, drank plenty of water and thus avoided altitude sickness. We crossed two more passes; the higher was Sinche La, at more than 16,000 feet (by this time free of snow). We saw Himalayan griffons -- vultures with 10-foot wing spans -- coasting the thermals over a valley; a covey of gray-and-white blood pheasants crossed our path, the males striking with red legs and tails. There were thousand-foot waterfalls, firs with purple or indigo cones and wild rose bushes with giant scarlet hips. We saw no other trekkers, but did encounter families of yak herders on the move, the women with butter churns strapped to their heads.</p>
        <p>We spent a rest day in Laya, four clusters of houses surrounded by wheat fields, all on a steeply terraced hillside -- a hidden land within a hidden land. The Layap, as the people are called, have a culture and a language of their own.</p>
        <p>I woke to hear our yak driver whistling his usual song, a haunting liquid tune. The refrain was taken up by a farmer walking to his field; soon children going to school trooped by singing the song. We passed women, in conical bamboo hats, yak-hair skirts and braid-trimmed jackets, threshing wheat in a courtyard. They burst into the same song. It seemed impossible, as if we had wandered into a set for ''Lost Horizon.'' The Layap women tried to sell us their hats and heavy turquoise, coral and silver jewelry. We, however, were still intent on providing for our yaks. Mike was happy to find a baby yak collar with red and blue tassels, meant to ward off evil. He also bought an intricately braided yak rope from our driver.</p>
        <p>A British man living with his family in Laya and working with the World Wildlife Federation said he'd seen red pandas, leopards and takin on the trail we would be taking, and that a friend of his claimed he'd seen a yeti, the elusive, and possibly mythical, wild man of the Himalayas. If we could meet the king, why not a yeti? It was with great expectations that we set out the next day.</p>
        <p>We were now leaving the high country, and the route became progressively more traveled, by Bhutanese students with headsets, women with chairs or tables strapped to their backs, even a man carrying a piece of corrugated roofing. We said goodbye to Fluffy and company and greeted the new horses that would accompany us the rest of the way. Because there were no valleys broad enough for campsites, we spent the night in Koina in a house recently built by the forest service. About 20 Bhutanese crowded into two rooms with smoky wood fires. Leigh, Marilyn and John took a third room and Mike and I a fourth, sleeping on air mattresses on the floor. By 9 p.m. the house was dark and silent.</p>
        <p>''The sky is our enemy,'' Namgay told John the next day. Indeed, it had rained at least part of every day. Mild temperatures (even in the mountains at night it hadn't gone below 40 degrees) meant that there were still leeches in the lower altitudes. Creepy but harmless, they look like small brown inchworms and insinuate themselves into clothing. I was bitten several times but only discovered it by the blood on my clothes.</p>
        <p>On the way to the little village of Gasa, where we'd hoped to visit the dzong, John slipped and fell off the trail. When he climbed back up he couldn't put his weight on one foot. He thought he'd sprained an ankle. (He wouldn't discover that it was broken until he was home in Seattle.) Phub and Jigme took turns carrying him to Gasa, where there was a doctor and a medical center, but no X-ray equipment. The doctor massaged and bandaged John's ankle and, since it was dark, invited him, Leigh and Marilyn to stay the night at his house. Mike and I, guided by forest service employees, had gone on to the camp at hot springs a thousand feet below.</p>
        <p>Phub and Jigme carried John to camp the next morning, where we had a scheduled rest day. We washed in the springs -- concrete-enclosed pools with moving, faintly sulfuric water, beside a crashing river. Besides us, there were two other trekkers camped in the little valley and some Bhutanese men staying at a guest house.</p>
        <p>The last two days, John rode one of the pack horses, or when the trail was too narrow and steep, he went piggyback on Phub or Jigme. At the rice-growing village of Damji, we met the schoolmaster, a friend of Phub's, who invited us to his school. We watched the children in their uniforms salute the flag, sing the national anthem and execute a calisthenics drill.</p>
        <p>Even the youngest study English, and were eager to practice with us.</p>
        <p>Shortly after lunch, we crossed a suspension footbridge and spotted Passang with two vans. We drove four hours to Thimphu, where we stayed in the Yeedzin Guest House for two nights while Phub or Passang ferried us by van to various sights. Since we had missed seeing takin on the trail, we went to view some contented captives in a fenced-in glade at the edge of town. We were happy to explore Thimphu, a pleasant city of about 45,000, but we were already yearning for the high wild country we'd left behind. I overheard Leigh and Marilyn making plans with Passang for another trek soon, this time in the east to see the black-necked cranes.</p>
        <p>Directions to Shangri-La</p>
        <p>Bhutan has been open to tourism only since 1974, and the industry is still tightly regulated. The rates are controlled by the BHUTAN TOURISM AUTHORITY, and even if you go through an American touring company, you must be sponsored by a Bhutanese travel guide. The rate per person per day is $200 (for groups of more than four), of which 10 percent is paid to the overseas travel agency. The money then is deposited with the Bhutan Tourism Authority, which takes 37 percent as a royalty. The rest of the money goes to the local tour operator, in local currency, and pays for food, accommodations, transportation and fees to the staff. If you are in a group of fewer than four, there is a daily surcharge of $40 each for one person, $30 for two people and $25 for three people. For a group of 16 and above, one person goes free; for a group of 11 to 15, one person goes at half price.</p>
        <p>We went through THUNDERBOLT TRAVEL, Post Office Box 162, Thimphu, Bhutan (telephone: 975-2-321-956; e-mail: tbolt@druknet.net.bt).</p>
        <p>In the United States, GEOGRAPHIC EXPEDITIONS, 2627 Lombard Street, San Francisco, Calif. 94123 (800-777-8183 or 415-922-0448; fax: 415-346-5535; e-mail: info@geoex.com) offers a variety of trips to Bhutan.</p>
