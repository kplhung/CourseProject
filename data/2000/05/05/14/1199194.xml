        <p>The elegant Hotel Meurice, across from the Tuileries gardens in Paris, is scheduled to reopen its mahogany doors in June after two years of renovation that gutted the interior, pared 180 rooms to 160, and pushed the infrastructure toward the 21st century. The renovation, aimed at restoring the building to its turn-of-the-20th-century opulence, uncovered a forgotten Art Nouveau glass dome with delicate fish-scale panels now adorning the hotel's gilded Winter Garden tea salon. The main restaurant, Le Meurice, is a Rococo jewel box with crystal chandeliers, antique beveled mirrors and one Michelin star.</p>
        <p>A new, 2,206-square-foot rooftop suite, dubbed the Belle Etoile, revolutionizes the idea of a room with a view. A zinc-roofed Belle Epoque folly encased in reflective glass, this $7,000-a-night, two-bedroom suite offers panoramic views from many points, including a round whirlpool encased in marble.</p>

        <p>The elegant Hotel Meurice, across from the Tuileries gardens in Paris, is scheduled to reopen its mahogany doors in June after two years of renovation that gutted the interior, pared 180 rooms to 160, and pushed the infrastructure toward the 21st century. The renovation, aimed at restoring the building to its turn-of-the-20th-century opulence, uncovered a forgotten Art Nouveau glass dome with delicate fish-scale panels now adorning the hotel's gilded Winter Garden tea salon. The main restaurant, Le Meurice, is a Rococo jewel box with crystal chandeliers, antique beveled mirrors and one Michelin star.</p>
        <p>A new, 2,206-square-foot rooftop suite, dubbed the Belle Etoile, revolutionizes the idea of a room with a view. A zinc-roofed Belle Epoque folly encased in reflective glass, this $7,000-a-night, two-bedroom suite offers panoramic views from many points, including a round whirlpool encased in marble.</p>
        <p>Rooms for business travelers, clustered on the second and third floors, are decorated in a simpler, more streamlined style than others and have work areas, safes big enough for laptop computers and separate lines for computers and fax machines. A new spa includes saunas, exercise machines and a beauty center.</p>
        <p>Since Augustin Meurice relocated his Paris establishment to the chic Rue de Rivoli in 1835, the Meurice has attracted a celebrity guest roster: the Shah of Iran was staying there when he was overthrown, King George VI was a regular, and Salvador Dali once filled his suite with sheep and staged a mock ovine execution. Rates start at $425 night, at 7.1 francs to the dollar. Hotel Meurice, 228, rue de Rivoli, 75001; (33-1) 44.58.10.10, fax (33-1) 44.58.10.17; www.meuricehotel.com.</p>
