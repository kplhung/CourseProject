        <p>On the eve of a meeting of the Indiana University trustees to decide whether his successful but volatile career will continue here, the embattled basketball coach Bob Knight acknowledged today that his temper had led him into past confrontations, and he promised to work harder at developing a more diplomatic approach.</p>

        <p>On the eve of a meeting of the Indiana University trustees to decide whether his successful but volatile career will continue here, the embattled basketball coach Bob Knight acknowledged today that his temper had led him into past confrontations, and he promised to work harder at developing a more diplomatic approach.</p>
        <p>Knight, whose 763 victories are seventh on college basketball's career victory list and who became an icon in Indiana by winning three national titles, also made it clear to the nine trustees meeting here today that he wanted to keep his job.</p>
        <p>''Practically all of us have some problem to deal with in life,'' Knight said in a six-paragraph statement released this afternoon. ''For some, it's something as simple as meeting people or talking in front of people. My temper problem is a lot more troublesome than those, and it is something I have had to deal with for as long as I can remember.</p>
        <p>''There are times in my passion for basketball that led me into confrontations that I could have handled a lot better. I have always been too confrontational, especially when I know I'm right. I know as well as anyone does: I have to develop a more diplomatic approach. I'm not very good at just forgetting something and going on, and I am truly sorry about that.''</p>
        <p>Knight, 59, stopped short of admitting to a host of allegations that began last March with a charge by a former player, Neil Reed, that Knight physically abused him. In fact, Knight appeared to refute Reed's allegation that Knight put a hand on his throat during a 1997 practice -- a videotape of which has fueled the investigation by the trustees -- saying his temper ''was not a factor in the investigated incident.''</p>
        <p>''I do feel that I should address something that was not a factor in the investigated incident: my temper,'' Knight said in the statement.</p>
        <p>In the months since two trustees were given the task of investigating Knight, the coach has been accused of choking and punching Kit Klingelhoffer, then an assistant sports information director, in the mid-1970's; intimidating an athletic department secretary, Jeanette Hartgraves, by throwing a vase against a wall in her office in 1988; accosting Ron Felling, then an assistant coach, in late 1999 and upbraiding his boss, Athletic Director Clarence Doninger, in a near-altercation earlier this year.</p>
        <p>It is unclear what the trustees will decide about Knight's fate in the wake of what for him is an extraordinary apology. The trustees have three options: recommending his dismissal, sanctioning him or continuing an already embarrassing investigation that has attracted national attention and divided Indiana faculty, students, alumni and fans.</p>
        <p>''I think that Mr. Knight's statement will provide the trustees with a compromise solution to the situation,'' said Murray Sperber, an Indiana professor and a frequent critic of Knight who writes frequently about college athletics. ''But I personally believe in accepting individual responsibility for one's actions, and so I hope that the trustees will continue the investigation and examine the facts of the case, and make their judgments on those alone.''</p>
        <p>In his statement, Knight made it clear he wanted another chance. Knight said he was working on his temper with the help of his wife, who has posted signs around the couple's home that read: The horse is dead. Get off it. ''I think I'm getting better at it, because of her and those signs,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Knight also acknowledged remorse for the times that he had been too zealous with his players on the practice floor.</p>
        <p>''I always wind up more upset with myself than with anyone else,'' he said in the statement. ''I can, and invariably do, make it up to our kids, but I cannot do that with myself. I can, and I will, try a little harder.''</p>
        <p>Knight also made it clear he was proud of building a program that has high graduation rates and has never been besmirched by National Collegiate Athletic Association sanctions. He is passionate about wanting the chance to continue to do so.</p>
        <p>''I'm as proud as a man can be of the basketball program we have been able to build over the last 29 years, prouder of the great kids that have made up that program and what they have gone on to do and be than I am of the games and of the championships they have won,'' he said in the statement.</p>
        <p>''Intense, demand and temper have been a three-braided rope for me, and I really believe that the first two have been a major reason for the success of our kids and teams. It is my job and my determination to temper that third braid. I will leave it up to our kids to judge if I'm improving, just as it is my job to keep improving them.''</p>
