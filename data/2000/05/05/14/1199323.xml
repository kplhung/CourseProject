        <p>LINDA NICKMAN was looking for three things when she decided to move from Philadelphia in the summer of 1998: a shorter commute to her job as an art teacher at Princeton High School, an affordable house with room for a studio and a community where she stood a good chance of getting to know her neighbors. She found all three in Lambertville, an old New Jersey river town of 4,300 tucked into the southwest corner of Hunterdon County that has undergone a striking rebirth in the last 20 years.</p>
        <p>Ms. Nickman's 35-minute drive to work is a pleasant trip through farm country. After renting for a year, she bought a row house near the Delaware River last May and is quickly getting to know everyone on the block. ''It's safe, clean, friendly, and I can walk practically everywhere,'' she said. ''There's a relaxed, laid-back feeling. People look at you on the street and smile. They ask how you are. And it's a diverse population -- there are families, singles, gays, old-timers and new people moving in.''</p>

        <p>LINDA NICKMAN was looking for three things when she decided to move from Philadelphia in the summer of 1998: a shorter commute to her job as an art teacher at Princeton High School, an affordable house with room for a studio and a community where she stood a good chance of getting to know her neighbors. She found all three in Lambertville, an old New Jersey river town of 4,300 tucked into the southwest corner of Hunterdon County that has undergone a striking rebirth in the last 20 years.</p>
        <p>Ms. Nickman's 35-minute drive to work is a pleasant trip through farm country. After renting for a year, she bought a row house near the Delaware River last May and is quickly getting to know everyone on the block. ''It's safe, clean, friendly, and I can walk practically everywhere,'' she said. ''There's a relaxed, laid-back feeling. People look at you on the street and smile. They ask how you are. And it's a diverse population -- there are families, singles, gays, old-timers and new people moving in.''</p>
        <p>When Ms. Nickman began looking for a house, though, she found there were plenty of others just as charmed by Lambertville  as she was. A former mill town that covers just over a square mile, Lambertville is full of Victorian and Federal-style brick row houses and brownstones, many with ornate woodwork, high ceilings and other period details still intact. In the last 15 years it has also become a weekend tourist stop for New Yorkers and Philadelphians who are drawn by block after block of antique shops, art galleries, restaurants and B &amp; B's.</p>
        <p>After a year and a half of searching, Ms. Nickman made an offer on the very same day she went to see a two-story, two-bedroom Victorian with pine floors, exposed wood beams, a finished basement and a fish pool in back. A bidding war ensued with another prospective buyer, but Ms. Nickman was the eventual winner at $141,000.  She describes the house this way: ''It's tiny, but really quaint.''</p>
        <p>Stories like Ms. Nickman's are becoming commonplace in Lambertville. ''There are too many buyers and not enough sellers,'' said Jeanne Galloway, a broker and the manager of Gloria Nilson Realtors. ''That's been true the last several years, but especially so in the last year.''</p>
        <p>To the delight, perhaps, of many of Lambertville's longtime residents, a row house that costs $150,000 today could have been picked up 25 years ago for $6,000. During the 60's and 70's, it was New Hope -- an artists' colony across the bridge on the Pennsylvania side of the Delaware -- that got all the attention. Lambertville, always a working-class town, suffered through factory closings and boarded-up shops.</p>
        <p>Now, some people contend that New Hope has become too noisy and crowded, with a surplus of ice cream parlors and T-shirt shops. Lambertville's civic leaders have tried to keep development in check, with mixed results. Although all the restaurants, antique shops and galleries have created parking and traffic bottlenecks, town officials have sought to limit the number of cars in town on weekends by encouraging developers to convert factory buildings into office space rather than retail or residential developments.</p>
        <p>The biggest complaint among residents, besides the scarcity of parking, is the fact that there is no longer a supermarket in town. The last one closed five years ago, opened again under new ownership for a year, and then went out of business. Residents have to drive to New Hope to do their food shopping. The antique shops have also replaced the practical mom-and-pop stores, like shoe shops and bakeries, that used to serve local customers.</p>
        <p>Bonnie J. Eick, Lambertville's tax collector and a part-time real estate agent for the  E. J. Lelie agency, said that about half of the home buyers in the last year have been Manhattanites who were looking for weekend homes or wanted a permanent move.  Some even commute to Manhattan by bus or by driving to Trenton to catch a train.</p>
        <p>T HEY'RE attracted by the small-town atmosphere, the lack of crime, and the decent school system,'' said Ms. Eick, 48, who has lived all her  life in Lambertville.</p>
        <p>Although a Lambertville house may look like a bargain in comparison to a Manhattan apartment, some local residents find the increase in prices alarming. They fear that children will no longer be able to buy a house down the street from their parents, as many have done for generations.</p>
        <p>The most affordable homes are small two-and-a-half story row houses about 10 blocks north of the main commercial street, Bridge Street. Typically, they sell for $135,000 to $180,000, said Ms. Eick, depending on whether they have been renovated. They have three bedrooms, one bath and an attic. The lots are 18 to 20 feet wide, with just enough backyard for a picnic table, a grill and a few chairs.</p>
        <p>Larger three-story houses with three or four bedrooms closer to Bridge Street range from $160,000 to $225,000, she said.</p>
        <p>A little farther west, there are three hills, and three-bedroom semidetached houses in this area, still within walking distance to the center of town, go for $150,000 and $250,000.</p>
        <p>Freestanding homes with four or more bedrooms command the highest prices in Lambertville, as do those on the river and those that border the Delaware &amp; Raritan Canal, which parallels the river. On Clinton Street, where houses on the canal go for up to $300,000, more modest properties directly across the street with smaller yards may be only $150,000, Ms. Eick said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Galloway of Gloria Nilson Realtors said that mansions on the town's most desireable streets, built in the 1800's by the owners of Lambertville's factories, have gone up in price faster than smaller houses and now sell for $300,000 to $400,000. One nine-bedroom brick Victorian on York Street, across from City Hall, was recently bought for $330,000 and is now undergoing extensive renovations.</p>
        <p>Although there are a fair number of apartments, demand is high, and they are snapped up quickly, Ms. Eick said. Typical rents for a one-bedroom are $750 to $1,000 a month, and for a two-bedroom, $850 to $1,200. There are also two buildings with a total of 75 federally subsidized apartments  for the elderly.</p>
        <p>Much of present-day Lambertville was built between 1820 and 1870, according to Gene Dennison, the president of the Historical Society.</p>
        <p>It became a thriving factory town, with rubber, paper, flax, flour, rope, twine and cotton mills, and factories making clothespins, hairpins, lace and wooden spokes for the wheels of Civil War wagons. The canal was built in the 1830's by Irish immigrants to transport coal and other goods.</p>
        <p>The town's earliest settlers were the Coryell, Holcombe and Lambert families. In 1812, John Lambert, a United States senator during Thomas Jefferson's administration, petitioned the government to open the first post office, changed the name of the town from Coryell's Ferry to Lambertville and made his nephew John the first postmaster.</p>
        <p>The Lambertville Public School in the center of town has 250 students in the first through the sixth grades, with a half-day kindergarten program. Average class size is 17, and Edward Stoloski, the district superintendent, said the school was designated a ''School of the Future'' last year at the New Jersey School Boards Association's annual convention because of its emphasis on technology. The school has 150 computers, including four in each classroom, plus a computer lab. The school is also known for its artist-in-residence program, in which local artists are invited in to work with students.</p>
        <p>On the Metropolitan Achievement Tests, which are given in the second, third, fifth and sixth grades, students' scores ranged from the 70st to the 92nd percentile this year, with the highest scores in math, science and language. Ninety-seven percent of the students were at or above grade level in reading.</p>
        <p>For grades 7 through 12, Lambertville's students attend the South Hunterdon Regional High School in nearby West Amwell, one of the smallest public high schools in New Jersey with only 400 students from three towns: Lambertville, Stockton and West Amwell.</p>
        <p>A typical English class has just 18 students, and some upper-level courses have only four or five students, said Dr. Thomas R. Davidson, superintendent of schools. About 85 percent of this year's graduating class of 71 seniors will go to a two- or four-year college. Last year, SAT averages were 518 in math and 516 in verbal, slightly higher than the state averages of 510 in math and 498 in verbal.</p>
        <p>The school is known for the wide range of extracurricular activities in its after-school program, including athletics, theater, newspaper and yearbook. Because of the school's small size, any student who wants to play on a sports team can.</p>
        <p>Private schools in the immediate area include the Pennington School and across the river in Bucks County, Pa., the Solebury  School and two Quaker schools, Buckingham Friends, with kindergarten through the eighth grade, and the George School, with grades 9 through 12.</p>
        <p>Because Lambertville is a river town, recreation is centered on the water. The 64-mile-long Delaware &amp; Raritan Canal State Park, which runs through Lambertville, is the longest and narrowest park in the state. The canal's old towpath is used by bikers, hikers, joggers and cross-country skiers.</p>
        <p>Lambertville also has Ely Field, a playground and baseball field, and Cavallo Park, a popular playground for toddlers. A 50-member orchestra, the Riverside Symphonia, performs at the Church of St. John the Evangelist in Lambertville seven times a year.</p>
