        <p>In New Orleans for Mardi Gras and drinking heavily, my friends and I got separated. When I returned to our hotel, I found my college roommate in bed with a girl from our school. Days later, I learned he'd had sex with her while she was in a drug-and-alcohol-induced stupor. In my view, he is a rapist, but I don't know how to react, given my friendship with him and my sympathies for her. -- Anonymous, Virginia  This does sound like date rape, and the first thing you should consider are the wishes of the victim. How is she responding? Does she want to report this to the police? What help would she like from you? Her interests are paramount.</p>

        <p>In New Orleans for Mardi Gras and drinking heavily, my friends and I got separated. When I returned to our hotel, I found my college roommate in bed with a girl from our school. Days later, I learned he'd had sex with her while she was in a drug-and-alcohol-induced stupor. In my view, he is a rapist, but I don't know how to react, given my friendship with him and my sympathies for her. -- Anonymous, Virginia  This does sound like date rape, and the first thing you should consider are the wishes of the victim. How is she responding? Does she want to report this to the police? What help would she like from you? Her interests are paramount.</p>
        <p>Your attitude toward the rapist should be shaped by his attitude toward his crime. If he is remorseful and has asked his victim's forgiveness and looked for a way to make amends and sought counseling, then you can continue your friendship. Remember, people make bad -- even dreadful -- choices. It is how they respond to their errors that is key. However, if he brushes off the entire matter, then you should have no more to do with him.</p>
        <p>After all, how could you? Will you introduce him to your other female friends? Will you warn them to avoid him? It is difficult to see how you could ever again think of him in an amicable and unguarded way.</p>
        <p>And you should say all this to him. Tell him that you value his friendship, but that unless he takes this seriously and realizes that he has a problem with drinking, or alcohol, or women, then you can no longer be his friend.</p>
        <p>Back in high school, a girlfriend and I debated the abortion issue in Sunday school. I favored legal abortion; she did not, even to save the mother's life, because if a woman died it was God's will. A few years later, she sent me a letter detailing her own abortion. Now, decades later, she is a professor at a college of our denomination. Should I out her? -- Anonymous, Illinois</p>
        <p>I'd chalk up her conversion to necessity; life has a way of altering our adolescent ideas. If I were held to everything I advocated in high school, I'd still be listening to the Dave Clark Five and sporting an unattractive haircut -- not a pretty picture.</p>
        <p>If her work at the college does not include taking an anti-abortion stand, then her personal beliefs on this issue are not relevant, and you should respect her privacy: that is, no outing. If, however, she aggressively takes a public anti-abortion stand, then her hypocrisy is entirely to the point, and you can include it in the debate. But before you take so strong a step, have a conversation with your old friend. It can't hurt to know more about the causes of her action and the consequences of yours.</p>
        <p>While working for a major studio, some co-workers and I were mistakenly issued extra paychecks. I suggested that we alert the payroll department, but my friends disagreed. Since the show was almost over, payroll would not have time to uncover the mistake. Plus, we had worked extra hours for a particularly parsimonious studio. I put my check away uncashed but never called payroll because that would be snitching on my friends. Was my response appropriate? -- Anonymous, Los Angeles</p>
        <p>Some people think that the American film industry is stale and unimaginative, but I'm encouraged by the boundless ingenuity of your colleagues when it comes to justifying whatever happens to be in their interest. Of course you can't keep the money. And while you needn't explicitly inform on your friends, you must tell the payroll office about the mistake with your check.</p>
