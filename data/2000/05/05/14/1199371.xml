        <p>In a major advance for cleanup of Long Island Sound, the House passed a bill last week authorizing $320 million in federal spending for upgrades of shoreline sewer plants and other efforts.</p>
        <p>The measure, the Long Island Sound Restoration Act, still requires Senate approval and faces appropriation hurdles. The money would be divided between New York and Connecticut, which are carrying out the cleanup with the Environmental Protection Agency.</p>
        <p>The 391-29 House vote came after the co-author, Rick Lazio, Republican of Brightwaters, declined to include as an amendment a bill written by Michael P. Forbes, Democrat of Quogue.</p>
        <p>The Forbes bill would have required the federal government to observe ocean dumping restrictions placed on private companies. Mr. Forbes has been a critic of a federal dredging project in the Thames River in New London, Conn., that allowed navigation by the Navy's Sea Wolf nuclear submarines. The contaminated spoil was dumped off Fishers Island in Long Island Sound.</p>
        <p>Mr. Forbes and others have questioned whether federal dumping has played a part in the killing of lobsters in the Sound, where the lobster industry has collapsed in the past year.</p>
        <p>The two states and the E.P.A. said in 1999 that estimated upgrades of all sewage plants would cost $6.5 billion, but estimates have declined to $1 billion because of better technology and reductions in the number of plants that would need upgrades.</p>
