        <p>Strawberry lovers who prize the sweet, intensely flavored but fragile strawberries from nearby farms usually have to curb their appetites until the end of May. But Raymond and Susie Dare, who own Cherry Lane Farms in Bridgeton, N.J., are already selling their delicious berries, at $2.50 a pint, in the Union Square Greenmarket on Wednesdays, Fridays and Saturdays.</p>
        <p>They had hoped that by using a new planting method -- setting the seedlings in late summer and keeping them under protective cloth and mulch all winter -- they would produce ripe berries as early as mid-April, but the unseasonably cold, rainy spring interfered.</p>

        <p>Strawberry lovers who prize the sweet, intensely flavored but fragile strawberries from nearby farms usually have to curb their appetites until the end of May.

        <p>They had hoped that by using a new planting method -- setting the seedlings in late summer and keeping them under protective cloth and mulch all winter -- they would produce ripe berries as early as mid-April, but the unseasonably cold, rainy spring interfered.</p>
        <p>Berry lovers also know it's never too early for shortcake. Here's a quick alternative:</p>
        <p>Beat 2 eggs with  1/2 cup milk, and soak four thick slices of brioche or hallah in the liquid until saturated. Dip the slices on both sides in some sugar spread on a plate. Fry the bread in melted butter until lightly browned and caramelized. Trim and slice a pint of strawberries, sugared if necessary, and arrange them atop the slices of warm French toast. Top each with a dollop of creme fraiche and serve.</p>
