        <p>Walker Evans wanted to be a writer, not a photographer. You can almost see the regret seeping into his photographs of signs and posters, window menus and tools embossed with the company name. These pictures of ordinary objects are, after all, also pictures of words.</p>
        <p>But Evans the photographer is unrivaled in one kind of writing: list writing. This may sound like faint praise, but Evans's lists -- of his likes and dislikes, of his prospective subjects, of his negatives, of the things he needed and the things he saw -- are powerful bits of vertical writing. They are everything that his photographs are: laconic, deadpan, sad, true and relentless.</p>

        <p>Walker Evans wanted to be a writer, not a photographer. You can almost see the regret seeping into his photographs of signs and posters, window menus and tools embossed with the company name. These pictures of ordinary objects are, after all, also pictures of words.</p>
        <p>But Evans the photographer is unrivaled in one kind of writing: list writing. This may sound like faint praise, but Evans's lists -- of his likes and dislikes, of his prospective subjects, of his negatives, of the things he needed and the things he saw -- are powerful bits of vertical writing. They are everything that his photographs are: laconic, deadpan, sad, true and relentless.</p>
        <p>It is not too much of a stretch to say that one of Evans's biggest gifts -- and one of his strongest ties to some of his modern descendants, especially Robert Frank, Edward Ruscha and Andy Warhol -- was his knack for making great lists, for laying things out thrillingly one after the other, with no connection except a string of ''ands.'' If lists counted as a literary form, Evans might have been a writer. As it was, he became a photographer and many of his great pictures look like lists.</p>
        <p>''Throughout his life, Evans wrote intense little prose poems, lists and sketches for proposed visual and literary projects,'' Jeff L. Rosenheim and Douglas Eklund write in ''Unclassified: A Walker Evans Anthology'' (Metropolitan Museum of Art/Scalo). In 1926-27 Evans composed a ''prose poem'' that is really a diary in the form of a list. It begins: ''Disgust in the boat train. The taxi horns of Paris. In the Tuileries Gardens. Wallace Backus, Shakespeare + Co.'' It includes numerous entries of just the word solitude.</p>
        <p>In 1929 Evans wrote the short story ''Brooms'' as ''a kind of unconscious literary farewell, in which he decided to 'omit' all of the troubling confessional elements of his 'inner life' '' and to assume instead an impersonal style, the authors of ''Unclassified'' write. In the middle of this goodbye to narrative, Evans included this list: ''Imperative Needs: suspenders, drawers, collar pin, bath slippers, Crime and Punishment, rubber cement.''</p>
        <p>In 1937 Evans and his friend and collaborator James Agee each made a list of the things they hated. Agee's list, beginning with ''The Anglo-Saxon tristesse,'' is self-conscious and high-flown. But Evans's list is a propulsive piece of modern writing. Under the heading ''Contempt for,'' Evans listed: ''men who try to fascinate women with their minds, gourmets, liberals, cultivated women, writers, successful artists who use the left to buttress their standing, the sex life of America, limited editions, 'atmosphere,' Bennington College, politics, men of my generation who became photographers during the Depression, journalists, new dealers, readers of the New Yorker, the corner of Madison Avenue and 56th St.'' And the list kept going, fueled by Evans's seemingly endless, free associative scorn.</p>
        <p>But what does all this list-making have to do with photography? It helps to compare Evans with his predecessors. ''Evans often spoke of photography as a form of collecting,'' Peter Galassi writes in the catalog for ''Walker Evans &amp; Company,'' an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art that shows Evans's alongside his forebears and followers. In this way he is very much like Eugene Atget and August Sander, two of the photographers he admired most.</p>
        <p>The German photographer Sander collected people. He made portraits of his countrymen profession by profession -- manufacturer, industrialist, sailor, farmer, butcher, baker, peasant. The French photographer Atget was a collector too. He surveyed turn-of-the-century Paris, taking pictures of this archway, that gate, this cul-de-sac, that shop window.</p>
        <p>In many of his photographs Evans was a collector like Sander and Atget. You can almost see him ticking off the items on his list: Town barbershop, click. Town monument, click. Town church, click. Sharecropper, click. Sharecropper's wife, click. Sharecropper's daughter, click.</p>
        <p>But not all his photographs are items picked off a list. Evans's most modern pictures are themselves lists with the rhythm, repetition, speed, momentum and humor of his written lists. Like his written lists, they have many items: this and this and this. They are propelled from within, as if by a motor. And they have a directional pull, a vector of implied movement.</p>
        <p>Look at the lineup of Model T's on a rainy street in Saratoga Springs (1931), receding diagonally into the distance. Or ''Roadside View'' (1936), taken in a coal-mining town in Alabama, where the houses and electrical poles march sullenly out of the frame. Or the sad pileup of cars in ''Joe's Auto Graveyard'' that pours out over the picture's borders. These arrays could go on and on.</p>
        <p>In their relentlessness, these photographs have much less to do with Evan's predecessors than with Evans's descendants. Evans's ''Frame Houses in Virginia'' (1936), a deadpan strip of houses trotting horizontally across the frame, looks like a practice run for Edward Ruscha's marathon of a list, ''Every Building on the Sunset Strip'' (1966), which is laid out in a long, accordion-folded strip.</p>
        <p>Some of Evans's portraits are lists too. In 1938 he went into the New York subways with his camera hidden in his coat and shot across the aisle. Most of the pictures he took are individual portraits. But if you look at the prints that include several subjects or at the contact sheets (reproduced in ''Unclassified''), on which the portraits are laid end to end, you can see the list. These have a drive that the individual portraits lack. Evans must have seen this, because he published the pictures as a series in a book titled ''Many Are Called.''</p>
        <p>In their sweet anonymity, they are close to the pictures taken by Evans's descendant Robert Frank. Mr. Frank's ''Trolley, New Orleans,'' with its faces lined up and looking blankly out of every window, is a list. The implied movement of the trolley, registered in the blur of the reflections in the upper windows, suggests that when these faces move along, others will take their place.</p>
        <p>So Evans took his gift for writing lists and turned it into something photographic. And when he went to Fortune magazine as the special photographic editor in the 40's, he brought it full circle, back to writing.</p>
        <p>Rather than using photographs as illustrations for a written text or as sources of information, he made the photographs dominant and the text submissive, with a series of photographs that had a nonnarrative logic and momentum of their own. He called them portfolios.</p>
        <p>Evans assigned the portfolios to young photographers. In 1953 he had Robert Frank, who was working on his great opus, ''The Americans,'' photograph businessmen on ''The Congressional,'' the train that ran from Washington to New York. He had Robert Mottor photograph American office life. And Evans photographed some of the portfolios himself.</p>
        <p>For instance, in August 1946, he photographed pedestrians walking in front of a blank wall at a street corner in Detroit. The result was ''Labor Anonymous.'' Tellingly, Evans began this project with a very specific typewritten list: he cut the want ads from a newspaper to get the names of jobs, then he listed the different types of workers he planned to shoot. But what he ended up with was an anonymous stream of people replacing his clearly written specifications.</p>
        <p>So Evans the list maker invented a new kind of photographic writing. The last line of Evans's 1929 short story ''Brooms'' contains this promise: ''Now I shall suck the dust out of chaos.'' What Evans meant is unclear, but whatever it was, his followers seemed to get it. In the introduction to Mr. Frank's ''Americans,'' Jack Kerouac wrote a memorable line that is a clear paraphrase of Evans's promise: ''He sucked a sad poem right out of America.'' And the sad poem was a list.</p>
