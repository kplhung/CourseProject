        <p>With access to millions of acres of public lands in the balance, a lobbying battle unfolding around the country is being portrayed by powerful groups on both sides as critical to the shape of America's outdoor future.</p>
        <p>At stake is the fate of vast tracts of national forest that the Clinton administration, in its last months in office, is rushing to put permanently off limits to road building. More than any other issue in recent years, the proposal has stirred environmental organizations and their opponents into political action, in a fresh test of the muscle that each side can wield.</p>
        <p>Much of the battle will be played out in high school cafeterias and community centers in places like Orofino, Idaho, and Flagstaff, Ariz., where the first of more than 300 public meetings the Forest Service is organizing were held yesterday to solicit public reaction to a draft plan for the roadless areas.</p>
        <p>But already the fight has begun to spill out in advertisements, on Web sites and in mass mailings from organizations like the Wilderness Society and the Blue Ribbon Coalition, a group of off-road vehicle advocates, all of which say they have placed the issue at the top of their agendas.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, there's a race going on to capture the grass roots and to influence the debate,'' said Josh Kardon, chief of staff to Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat whose state is shaping up as an important battleground.</p>
        <p>The draft plan, made public by the Forest Service last week, would bar road construction across nearly a quarter of the national forest lands, or 2 percent of the nation's land mass. In their own way, the arguments being sounded for and against the plan are equally broad in scope.</p>
        <p>A television advertisement being broadcast by the Heritage Forests Campaign depicts ghostly images of wilderness despoiled by logging, and warns, in reference to the forests: ''Once they're gone, they're gone forever.'' By contrast, the timber industry, which would lose access to some logging under the plan, has conjured up its own Armageddon, by pointing to the fires in Los Alamos, N.M., to warn that the same may occur elsewhere if a broad ban on road building is put in place.</p>
        <p>''Basically, you're condemning the areas that have no roads to just these kinds of holocausts in the future,'' said W. Henson Moore, a former congressman from Louisiana who is head of the American Forest and Paper Association.</p>
        <p>Edward Moreland, Washington representative for the American Motorcyclist Association, said, ''This to us is the single largest threat in many, many years to continued access to public land, and we're taking the threat very seriously.''</p>
        <p>The bitterness of the debate reflects deep differences about the proper role of the national forests, but it also seems to reflect a shared view that the issue can push the right hot buttons at a time of general softening in the environmental debate.</p>
        <p>''On both sides, these groups want to build their membership base, and in an election year, this is the kind of mobilizing that can also spill over into the political process,'' said Mark Rey, a former timber industry official who is now staff director of the Senate subcommittee that oversees forestry issues.</p>
        <p>The draft plan was developed at President Clinton's directive and would prohibit road building across 43 million acres of national forest, comprising most of the land that has never been developed but has never explicitly been set aside as a wilderness area.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton vowed last year to ''protect all of this before it's too late,'' but most leading environmental groups argue that the plan should go further, by banning logging as well as roads, and by addressing Alaska's Tongass National Forest, the nation's largest.</p>
        <p>But in articulating a rival view, most off-road vehicle advocates and timber industry officials have been arguing that too much public land has already been placed off limits to public use, and the roadless approach would deal a final, fatal blow to that principle.</p>
        <p>That the battle over roadless areas will next play out in the public meetings follows from a decision by the administration to bypass Congress, and try to impose the ban through administrative powers.</p>
        <p>The approach is an effort to skirt opposition from powerful Western lawmakers like Senator Larry E. Craig of Idaho, but by law, it also requires a prolonged period of public comment, and the administration is going to great lengths to shield itself from complaints that it was unwilling to hear out the plan's foes.</p>
        <p>The series of public meetings now planned over the next 60 days is by far the most extensive such review ever held for a proposed change in federal rules, said Chris Wood, senior policy adviser to the chief of the Forest Service.</p>
        <p>About 200 meetings were held last winter, and, having already reviewed about 500,000 letters and postcards on the issue, the Forest Service is now preparing to sift through as many as one million more, many of which have already been generated through forms posted on various organization's Web sites.</p>
        <p>''We're going above and beyond, and some people say excessively so, in order to make sure that people have a full opportunity to comment,'' said Mr. Wood. A Forest Service official said the cost of the review would exceed $10 million.</p>
        <p>This round of meetings, to be held through June 2, is intended to allow the Forest Service to present its plan, so any real fireworks are not likely to emerge until another round, which begins in mid-June.</p>
        <p>The White House has made clear that its intention is to see the new rules issued well before Mr. Clinton leaves office in January, to cement what presidential aides have called an important part of his legacy.</p>
        <p>Though Vice President Al Gore has been an enthusiastic advocate of wider roadless areas, his Republican opponent, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, has not. And Mr. Bush has said that he would address such issues through close consultation with state and local officials, who in Idaho and other states have been battling the administration's plans.</p>
        <p>That backdrop has added a sharply partisan tone to some of the lobbying now under way, with some environmentalists warning that Mr. Bush would attempt to reverse any roadless policy the administration puts in place while some critics of the plan say they doubt they will receive a fair hearing.</p>
        <p>''Nobody has any illusions about whether or not their comments will be seriously considered by the Forest Service under this administration's leadership,'' said Stefany Bayles of the Intermountain Forest Association in Pocatello, Idaho, a timber organization that has filed suit to challenge the rule-making process.</p>
        <p>In planning their lobbying, officials of organizations most actively involved in the fight say they are working more closely than ever before to coordinate what in the past have been fragmented efforts.</p>
        <p>For example, the leaders from the Sierra Club, the Wilderness Society and other major environmental groups have been consulting by conference call at least once a week to hone an advocacy campaign that Ken Rait, director of the Heritage Forests Campaign, said will ultimately include more than $4 million in spending. Much of that was provided to Mr. Rait's group in a grant from the Pew Charitable Trusts.</p>
        <p>Among major opponents of roadless efforts, timber industry officials and off-road vehicle advocates say their budgets will be far smaller, but they would not disclose how much they plan to spend. Along with its lobbying efforts, the timber industry's role as a major campaign donor has long magnified its political clout.</p>
        <p>Still, as in any public debate, at least some of the noise over the roadless issue is clearly intended in part for narrow ends. All of the groups using the Internet to mobilize their followers also use the sites to enlist contributions and new members.</p>
        <p>''These sorts of threats make it easier to convince folks that they need to team up with others in an organization like ours,'' said Clark Collins, executive director of the Blue Ribbon Coalition, which says it represents about 600,000 off-road vehicle advocates and other public land users.</p>
