        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>You report (front page, May 15)  that for six years researchers refused to study Erich Karl Fuchs, a gay man who had had unprotected sex for years yet who remained immune to the AIDS virus. After all the fear, not to mention the AIDS epidemic in Africa, the researchers' inaction was reckless. In their hurry to dismiss a volunteer, they bypassed an important discovery.</p>

        <p>You report (front page, May 15)  that for six years researchers refused to study Erich Karl Fuchs, a gay man who had had unprotected sex for years yet who remained immune to the AIDS virus. After all the fear, not to mention the AIDS epidemic in Africa, the researchers' inaction was reckless. In their hurry to dismiss a volunteer, they bypassed an important discovery.</p>
        <p>Six whole years could have been spent figuring out and understanding why some people seem to have a special gene that makes them immune to the deadly virus. How can the human race be expected to progress and survive if researchers let an opportunity like that slip through their fingers without even batting an eye?</p>
