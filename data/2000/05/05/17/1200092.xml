        <p>There was James Bradley. There was the larger-than-life-size Iwo Jima memorial in the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum, with its iconic image of the Stars and Stripes rising on Mount Suribachi on Feb. 23, 1945. And there was a photographer.</p>

        <p>There was James Bradley. There was the larger-than-life-size Iwo Jima memorial in the Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum, with its iconic image of the Stars and Stripes rising on Mount Suribachi on Feb. 23, 1945. And there was a photographer.</p>
        <p>There was only one possible picture.</p>
        <p>''Let's just do it!'' Mr. Bradley said.</p>
        <p>Snappy in a blazer and red tie, he climbed onto the rocky base of the monument, a model of the Marine Corps Memorial at Arlington National Cemetery, and balanced himself among the six helmeted figures who were frozen in one four-hundredth of a second in one of the most famous tableaus of all time.</p>
        <p>It was a moment's camaraderie binding Mr. Bradley not only to the ordinary Americans who performed extraordinary acts of heroism in the fiercest battle of World War II but also to one man in particular. The second-lowest figure gripping the pipe onto which a flag had been tied when a chance encounter with an Associated Press photographer yielded an indelible image of victory was his father, John Henry Bradley, a Navy medical corpsman known as Doc who subsequently won the Navy Cross, a notch below the Medal of Honor.</p>
        <p>The younger Bradley's quest for his father's strangely secretive past and the stories of the Easy Company flag-raisers behind ''The Photograph,'' as he calls Joe Rosenthal's serendipitous Pulitzer Prize-winning shot, are recounted in his book, ''Flags of Our Fathers,'' written with Ron Powers and published this month by Bantam. It will rank No. 3 on The New York Times's nonfiction best-seller list on Sunday and the following week it rises to No. 2.</p>
        <p>. The book has been praised by the historian Stephen Ambrose as ''the best battle book I ever read.'' In a review for The Times, Richard Bernstein cited it as ''one of the most instructive and moving books on war and its aftermath that we are likely to see.''</p>
        <p>In the harrowing 36-day struggle to dislodge 22,000 Japanese defenders from eight square miles of sulphurous rock and its 550-foot volcanic crater, the 80,000 Marine invaders took 25,851 casualties, including 6,825 dead. Three flag-raisers died in the fighting that continued after the flag went up. Virtually all the Japanese were wiped out.</p>
        <p>''I never set out to write a book,'' said Mr. Bradley, 46, a traveling salesman and maker of corporate films. ''I set out to find my father's past.''</p>
        <p>It was no easy task. The elder Bradley, a funeral director in Antigo, Wis., died in 1994, the last of the six flag-raisers. But throughout his life, James Bradley said, his father maintained a studied silence about the A.P. photograph and the war, claiming he had forgotten everything. ''The heroes of Iwo Jima,'' he told his son, ''are the guys who didn't come back.'' Just once he let the wall down, when he told James, then 16, about a buddy who had been captured by the Japanese and tortured.</p>
        <p>It was only after his father's death, Mr. Bradley said, that, searching for a will, the family found, tossed in a box, a copy of the A.P. photograph and other war memorabilia. ''It was like sedimentary layers -- nothing was disturbed,'' he said. One letter was particularly striking. His father had mailed it from Iwo Jima three days after the flag-raising, calling it ''the happiest moment of my life.''</p>
        <p>It stunned the family. ''I burst out crying,'' Mr. Bradley said. ''There was this chasm here. If that was the happiest moment of his life, why had he never talked about it?''</p>
        <p>Years before, he said, he had shown his father and other family members the Waldorf-Astoria on a tour. He learned later that his father and other flag-raisers had been thronged at the hotel after Franklin D. Roosevelt brought them home in the last months of the war for a victory bond drive. ''He never said, 'Oh, I slept here,' or 'The Duke and Duchess tried to get my autograph,' '' Mr. Bradley recalled.</p>
        <p>That gave rise to other questions. What had happened to the other flag-raisers?</p>
        <p>He discovered, he said, new meaning in the slogan on the Marine Corps Memorial reproduced on the Intrepid and elsewhere: ''Uncommon Valor Was a Common Virtue.''</p>
        <p>''I was looking for uncommon valor,'' he said. ''I was looking at the wrong end of the equation. It was common virtue. These had been good little boys growing up, and they were good boys on the island. They were just trying to save their friends' lives.''</p>
        <p>Although not a professional writer or researcher, or a soldier like one of his seven siblings who was nearly killed in Vietnam, Mr. Bradley said he had another skill that had come in handy in trying to pry out long-hidden secrets. ''I was the No. 1 pots and pans salesman in the U.S.,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As a freshman at Notre Dame in 1973, he said, he took a summer job selling Ekco kitchenware door to door. ''We'd drive to a small town. Within a few hours, I'd know who was getting married and everything else. I love getting into someone else's life. My mother said I'll always be knocking on doors.''</p>
        <p>His horizons broadened further in his sophomore year when he enrolled in a study program abroad. . ''To pick France or Germany, you had to be fluent in the language,'' he explained. ''But no sophomore was fluent in Japanese.'' Besides, he said, ''I did not connect my father fighting the Japanese to going to Japan.''  Typically, the laconic senior Bradley offered no objection. ''If the good fathers of Notre Dame approve of it, it's O.K. with me,'' he recalled his father as saying.</p>
        <p>Japan so enthralled him, Mr. Bradley said, that he dropped out of Notre Dame at 19 to return to Tokyo. There he ran off with an 18-year-old Japanese woman, trailed by private detectives hired by her outraged family. They traveled throughout Asia and to Iran, where Mr. Bradley taught English, and to Afghanistan, where, he said, he nearly died of amoebic dysentery and got help from the American Embassy by throwing himself on the gate and daring marines to shoot him.</p>
        <p>It wasn't that he was rootless or rebellious, he said; it was just that for a child of rural Wisconsin the world suddenly offered all its wonders. But then, his wanderlust quelled, he enrolled at the University of Wisconsin at Madison to study history, only to pull up stakes for Europe when his degree and 300 resumes resulted in not one job offer.</p>
        <p>All he knew of his father's past then, he said, was that he had been a Navy corpsman and had appeared in the famous flag-raising photo.</p>
        <p>In 1979 he traveled to New York to visit a friend and found ''the pulse of a huge city'' and a home. He found a job making corporate films with hired celebrities, and within months, he said, ''I was riding around with Bill Cosby, Gladys Knight and the Pips and Tony Bennett.'' He started his own film company and traveled back and forth to Japan to produce a television series about New York.</p>
        <p>No one there knew, he said, that he was the son of a flag-raiser, but it would not have made any difference. ''We won the war,'' he said. ''It was an old story.'' At times he met with Japanese war veterans, and once thought: ''This is such a nice man -- and he was out to kill my dad.''</p>
        <p>He traveled the world courting adventure, watching lions in Africa and visiting the base camp of Mount Everest. In an early exploitation of the Internet, he developed an international telephone business in 1994. But everywhere he went, he said, when he mentioned his connection to ''The Photograph,'' people's eyes widened.</p>
        <p>Something the mystery writer Dick Francis said started him writing, Mr. Bradley said. ''He said to write your own story first.'' So he starting sketching out an autobiography, filling 800 notebook pages.</p>
        <p>But with his father's death, he said, he shifted to an even more compelling subject: Doc Bradley and the history his father had tried so assiduously to blank out.</p>
        <p>Other Iwo Jima veterans were often as close-mouthed as his father, he found. Still, by recounting his own story as the son of a flag-raiser, he often broke through. One man he called, Mr. Bradley said, began by insisting he didn't remember anything. ''Then he spent 40 minutes crying and talking,'' he said. ''At the end, he said, 'That's all I can say' and hung up.''</p>
        <p>''Man,'' Mr. Bradley said, ''I can tell you my keyboard was all wet. I was beyond wiping my face. I shut the computer off.''</p>
        <p>He ended up reconstructing the young lives of the other flag-raisers, Franklin Sousley, Harlon Block, Ira Hayes, Rene Gagnon and Mike Strank, and much of the battle, including John Bradley's heroic rescue of many wounded buddies.</p>
        <p>Among the myths Mr. Bradley said he was able to put to rest was that the photograph was posed. Actually, there had been an earlier flag-raising that day, but when an officer wanted the first flag as a souvenir, an order came to hoist a larger one. It happened so fast that Rosenthal of the A. P. shot the photograph without looking in the viewfinder.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bradley, twice divorced and the father of four children, worked for several years on the book at home in Manhattan and in Rye, N.Y. In awe of the men of Iwo Jima, he said, ''I would not allow my name to be put in the book.'' But 27 publishers rejected the work, finding it, as he said, ''one of the more boring ideas in the last century.'' Then, with a new agent, Jim Hornfischer, and a co-writer, Mr. Powers, a Pulitzer-Prize winning journalist and author, Mr. Bradley said, ''We refocused it on a son's search.''</p>
        <p>He learned a lot about his father -- and his father's foes, Mr. Bradley wrote. ''Only now, years later, do I realize that the values of the Japanese and John Bradley were so similar,'' he said. ''Quietness, politeness, integrity, honor, simplicity, devotion to family.''</p>
        <p>Would his father regard the book as a betrayal of his silence?</p>
        <p>''He'd love it,'' Mr. Bradley said. ''He didn't like to talk about it because the focal point was always on him. He would have loved deflecting the attention to those who were the real heroes.''</p>
        <p>Memories Still Echoing, Even After 55 Years</p>
        <p>Fifty-five years after World War II ended, memories are still rekindled by books and films that focus on the experiences of veterans, including two books by Tom Brokaw, ''The Greatest Generation'' and ''The Greatest Generation Speaks.'' Following are excerpts from letters Mr. Brokaw has received from readers.</p>
        <p>From Jacqueline Chmela Scott, whose father was a veteran:</p>
        <p>I am 42 years old, and my father was in World War II, stationed in occupied Japan after the bombing. His Army career was mentioned in passing but never discussed in any great lengths. When I was in the third grade, one of my projects was to interview a veteran. While my father read his evening paper, I asked him what war sounded like. He lowered the newspaper and said, ''It sounded like hell.'' That was the end of the interview.</p>
        <p>From Ruth M. Berryman, whose brother, Don, who served with the 30th Infantry Division, was killed in Germany on April 21, 1945, and is buried in the military cemetery at Maastricht in the Netherlands:</p>
        <p>Fifty years later, I was working in a Hotel in Auburn Hills, Mich., and met a family from Holland. . . . Of course, I had to tell them about my brother, and the young man, who was only 19 at the time, told me he would put flowers on my brother's grave. . . . The following April, I was at work and in walked a group of people with camera rolling, asking if I was Ruth Berryman.</p>
        <p>KLM had sponsored a contest, celebrating their 75th anniversary and basically, it said, ''Make a wish.'' This young man wrote and wished that KLM would fly me to Holland to visit my brother's grave. He won! Only 19 years old (approximately the age of my brother when he was killed), and this was his wish. . . . I was so awed by that cemetery that I could only sob. Words will never be able to describe 8,301 glistening white crosses laid out in that perfect semicircle. There was a feeling of closure as I laid roses on that 50-year-old grave.</p>
        <p>From Curt Johnson, a member of the 20th Armored Division:</p>
        <p>The most traumatic event occurred when, as the chief of staff's radio operator, I received a haunting message in early April that became a horribly appalling problem and the basis for the Nuremberg war crimes trials of Nazis accused of crimes against humanity. The message was from our armored cavalry company commander and sounded so desperate that I became edgy as I copied the words coming from my radio. I paraphrase: ''Found prison camp at Dachau with a few men desperately clinging to life, piles of bodies and skeletons. Send all available medical assistance, a doctor, nutritional supplies, blankets, clothing and mortuary technicians. Am working with 45th Infantry Division. Problem is enormous. SS Guards under arrest. Most Urgent!''</p>
        <p>From Bernard Sippin, whose brother Victor, a navy machinist, was killed when his PT boat struck a German mine just off southern France:</p>
        <p>Five men were killed, including my brother, none of whom were found. . . . I can remember when my mother received the telegram that Vic was missing in action. For the next year we always hoped and prayed he would turn up alive. Our family is Jewish and during Passover services, my father would always ask God to return him. Even now when I think about it, it gets me choked up. A year after he was reported missing, a final telegram came telling us the military and Navy considered him killed in action.</p>
