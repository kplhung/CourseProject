        <p>The American flag flies over Wal-Mart in this Minneapolis suburb. The parking lot is packed with Ford S.U.V.'s and Chevy pickups. Even the stucco facade is a patriotic melange of red, white and blue.</p>
        <p>Yet the appeal of America's most successful retail chain, with its ''We Sell for Less'' slogan emblazoned over the front door, stems in part from the enormous low-cost production capacity of a faraway nation that many people in this country view as a moral outcast and potential military rival: China.</p>
        <p>From $16.95 Looney Tunes Tweeties to $5.94 Rawlings N.C.A.A. Final Four basketballs, Wal-Marts are two-square-acre valentines to the idea that America should trade with China -- or, as President Clinton put it when visiting a nearby farm last week, ''reaching out a hand, not shaking a clenched fist.''</p>
        <p>But even as they fill their carts, shoppers have their doubts.</p>
        <p>Dawn Hentges, a housewife, was browsing specials in the shoe section, where ''China'' is inscribed on seemingly every tongue or sole.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hentges ruminated about a friend who had recently adopted a Chinese baby girl. The girl, she said, had to be treated for eczema and lice she acquired in a government-run orphanage. ''They just throw their little girls out like the trash,'' she said. ''That place really scares me.''</p>
        <p>She said she would prefer not to buy Chinese goods, but suggested that it was not easy to keep the faith when ''every other thing'' she looked at was made there.</p>
        <p>Mike Hanaho helped his daughter lace up new made-in-China Nike sneakers as he discussed China's growing military might. A Navy veteran who was stationed in the Pacific in the late 1980's, Mr. Hanaho said China's Asian neighbors worried about its regional ambitions. ''Taiwan sure sees them as the evil empire,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Congress is to vote next week on whether to upgrade economic ties with Beijing, a step that would allow American companies to take full advantage of concessions China made to enter the World Trade Organization. The cliffhanger in the House, where supporters and opponents are locked in a battle to control the future of United States-China relations, echoes in the Midwest as dissonance.  People play with Chinese-made toys, fish with Chinese-made rods and ride Chinese-made bicycles, all decent products at low prices, the staples of Wal-Mart. But they also worry about China's human rights abuses and its military buildup.</p>
        <p>Most of the shoppers said they were aware that many consumer products come from China. Some say America's appetite for goods from China encourages capitalism and promotes change there.</p>
        <p>Others say they worry that the tens of billions of dollars Americans spend on Chinese goods each year only entrenches the Beijing leadership, though they rarely use their wallets to support their convictions.</p>
        <p>Shopping for spray paint, Fred Holloway said he did not see what the fuss was about. Mr. Holloway, a software engineer for Medtronic, a Minneapolis-based maker of medical products, argues that trade and politics don't mix. ''We sell them some of our pacemakers,'' he said, referring to a Medtronic product. ''So why shouldn't I buy their stuff? I mean, that's normal.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Holloway compared the China trade debate to the ongoing feud about whether Elian Gonzalez should go back to Cuba to live with his father. ''That should be about family, and China should be about trade,'' he said. ''I don't agree with those people who want to mix it up with whether they're Communists.''</p>
        <p>Still, when asked how he would vote on the issue before lawmakers -- whether to continue to review China's trade status each year or, as President Clinton has asked, grant so-called permanent normal trade relations -- he stepped back, scratched his beard and hedged. ''We probably still need the power to review it every so often,'' he said. ''Say if they attack Taiwan, then it can't just be business as usual.''</p>
        <p>If there is a big group of Americans who refuse to buy Chinese-made goods for political reasons, they probably are not Wal-Mart shoppers. Though the store drapes itself in Americana and uses bright shelf tags to advertise ''Made in the U.S.A.'' products, the chain is an importing goliath.</p>
        <p>From car stereos to steel-toed work boots, Wal-Mart is the single largest United States importer. About half of its imports come from China, according to a study of Customs Department documents conducted by the Citizens Trade Campaign, which is critical of the company. Wal-Mart declined to comment on what percentage of its merchandise was made in China.</p>
        <p>Overall, the United States bought $82 billion worth of China-made goods last year, $69 billion more than the value of what it sold to China. The trade deficit, America's second largest, was slightly smaller than the one with Japan.</p>
        <p>Japan in the 1980's inspired fears that its high-quality, high-tech products would put Americans out of business. The anti-China lobby complains more about an affront to American values. Some crusaders have targeted Wal-Mart itself, accusing the company of exploiting Chinese workers in sweatshops.</p>
        <p>For unions and some lawmakers, Chinese labor and human rights practices are a central issue in the trade debate.</p>
        <p>Wal-Mart says it neither operates nor does business with sweatshops. The company says it frequently inspects conditions at all of its own factories and those of many of its suppliers to ensure that they maintain Western standards.</p>
        <p>Americans implicitly vote on the issue every day.</p>
        <p>Joyce Smith, a worker in a Minneapolis factory that makes Harley Davidson motorcycle parts, said she wondered how Chinese laborers bear the strain of working 14-hour days for 3 cents an hour, if a recent television expose she saw is true.</p>
        <p>''It's just really sad about those women,'' she said of the Chinese workers. She dangled a pair of girls' slippers and searched for the price tag. ''These cost $7.95, but you can bet that those workers don't see more than a penny or two.''</p>
        <p>Asked if that meant she would shun such products, she raised her eyebrows and pushed her cart ahead.</p>
        <p>China is an enigma. It is Communist and occasionally bellicose, but less powerful or menacing than the former Soviet Union. Its economy has grown quickly and it has become one of the world's largest exporters, but its industries have yet to challenge the United States directly the way Japan and Germany did in the 80's.</p>
        <p>All that leaves some people preferring the middle course -- neither confrontation nor acquiescence.</p>
        <p>''We should be in there picking their brains,'' said Don Gavic, a World War II veteran with a wizened face, well tanned from his days teaching golf in Minneapolis. He is not one to dismiss what he calls the ''Asia threat.'' But he argues that China's opponents have it all wrong. He said he believes in engagement.</p>
        <p>''If you want to know what they are thinking, you can't cut them off,'' he said, pausing to put a $10.88 Ozark Trail packable armchair, made in China, into his cart.</p>
        <p>Like many others in Minnesota, Mr. Gavic has more than a passing interest in the question. His son-in-law has a 600-acre family soybean farm near here. Farmers have been among the strongest supporters of granting China permanent normal trade relations, because they see doing so as giving them more access to that country's huge but tightly regulated grain market.</p>
        <p>''We sold wheat to the Soviets, didn't we?'' Mr. Gavic said. ''My son-in-law has bank loans riding on this.''</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Clinton said on Friday during his visit to this area that the China vote in Congress was vital to protecting America's economic and national security interests, ''permanent normal trade relations'' do not rattle people the way Sputnik and ''mutually assured destruction'' once did, at least not Minnesota residents on the first day of walleye fishing season.</p>
        <p>Deborah Hackett, a white-haired sock shopper of 60, brushed off a question about United States relations with China with a one-sentence answer. The more money Americans spend on Chinese imports, the better to promote capitalism, she said.</p>
        <p>Asked how she would choose among Wal-Mart's socks -- some made in the United States, others in Costa Rica and many others, of course, in China -- she said, ''I want the ones that match my pants.''</p>
