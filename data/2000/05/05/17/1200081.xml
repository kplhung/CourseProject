        <p>On Saturday night, shortly before the concert by the soprano Dawn Upshaw and the Kronos Quartet began at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola on Park Avenue, a woman with a ticket was distressed to learn that seating was first come first served. All the seats up close had been taken.</p>
        <p>''Don't worry,'' an usher reassured her. ''The music will sound the same no matter where you are in the church.''</p>
        <p>The usher was not complimenting the resonant acoustics of this popular concert site. She meant that the quartet and Ms. Upshaw were to be amplified, so the sound would be processed evenly throughout the space. For years amplification has been integral both to the works written for the Kronos and to their playing style, so that nuances and details tend to get blended into murky soups of sound. That was especially so in this reverberant church.</p>
        <p>This was the second of three concerts that Ms. Upshaw is presenting called ''Images of Dawn,'' sponsored by Lincoln Center. But with negligible works by composers from India, Argentina, Egypt and elsewhere, it might have been called ''Crossover Music From Around the World.'' The Kronos prides itself on its explorations of international music. Yet most of these pieces, at least as performed here in arrangements for Ms. Upshaw and the quartet, seemed like sound environments to back up the shifting colored lights. Everything sounded vaguely ethnic and oddly similar.</p>
        <p>Take, for example, ''Aaj Ki Raat'' (''Tonight Is the Night''), by the Indian composer Rahul Dev Burman, which was played twice in arrangements by Osvaldo Golijov, one with and one without soprano. The work included the recorded performance of the Hindustani tabla master Zakir Hussain, a living genius, whose unadulterated performances of Indian music are among the most thrilling concerts to be heard anywhere. Here Mr. Hussain's contribution was used like some rhythmic track for a piece of Indian pop.</p>
        <p>An artist who has been as substantive and serious as Ms. Upshaw should be able to do anything she wants. She has explored a wide array of music and has given wonderfully stylish performances of songs by Rodgers and Hart, Woody Guthrie and Stephen Sondheim.</p>
        <p>Perhaps when heard in a musically simpler and more idiomatic setting, the song that Ms. Upshaw sang by the Egyptian composer Al-Shayk Abul-Ila Muhammad has an elegiac beauty. But here, the amplified sound effects and cloying string quartet writing made it seem like some mawkish and pseudomystical pop ballad. Mr. Golijov's arrangement of ''Quisiera Yo Renegar,'' a traditional Spanish song, was almost embarrassing. While the quartet played the instrumental introduction with its hints of flamenco and slithering glissandi, Ms. Upshaw stood to the side shouting ''Ole!'' through her body microphone.</p>
        <p>The treacly arrangement of Stephen Foster's ''Ah! May the Red Rose Live Alway,'' which featured David Harrington's schmoozy rendering of the violin solo line, was hard to take, especially when one recalled that Ms. Upshaw's revered mentor, Jan De Gaetani, recorded this repertory with such simplicity and elegance -- and no amplified echo effects.</p>
