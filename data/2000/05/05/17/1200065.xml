        <p>The ice cream mix-ins at the new Petrossian Cafe and Boutique, 911 Seventh Avenue, a few steps from the restaurant on the corner of 58th Street, are a far cry from the usual. Passion fruit seeds, caraway seeds, orange zest, praline jelly and pistachios are arrayed in small containers on the bakery counter, where ice cream ($6 to $8 a portion), fruit tarts ($6), filled beignets ($6 for six) and layered coupes of cream, cake, jelly and mousse ($7 to $8) are assembled a la minute -- in two to four minutes -- while you wait.</p>
        <p>For the chef, Philippe Conticini, and the company's president, Armen Petrossian, freshness is paramount. The caramelized apple tart with riesling gelee is assembled and warmed just before serving, so that the crisp pastry shell does not become soggy. The vanilla ice cream is churned fresh, order by order. Classic French pastries like gat eau St.-Honore must be ordered in advance.</p>

        <p>Opposite the bakery in the dark wood, marble and tile shop is a counter laden with Petrossian's signature caviar and smoked fish specialties, some of which go into sandwiches ($8 to $14), served at tables on the balcony. There are also breads, croissants, cheese buns and savory quick breads ($2 to $5), which are sold starting at 7 a.m. But those are not baked to order. At that hour, who can wait?</p>
