        <p>DINNER at the freshly renovated Sea Grill starts with a bang. No sooner have you taken your seat than a team of waiters approaches, bearing clear, cylindrical glasses filled with a white substance. On my first visit to the restaurant, I assumed they were votive candles, until the waiters placed little spoons on the table and, looking more closely, I saw a small dollop of caviar in the glass.</p>
        <p>The candle turned out to be a sturgeon parfait, a custardy mousse topped with osetra caviar and concealing, way down at the bottom, luscious chunks of smoked sturgeon, a happy reward for those who dig deep. In the nightly courtship ritual of dining, most chefs offer a small but tasteful gemstone, but Edward Brown, the Sea Grill's longtime executive chef, is looking for big-time romance on the first date. The sturgeon starter is a Joan Collins-league diamond.</p>

        <p>DINNER at the freshly renovated Sea Grill starts with a bang. No sooner have you taken your seat than a team of waiters approaches, bearing clear, cylindrical glasses filled with a white substance. On my first visit to the restaurant, I assumed they were votive candles, until the waiters placed little spoons on the table and, looking more closely, I saw a small dollop of caviar in the glass.</p>
        <p>The candle turned out to be a sturgeon parfait, a custardy mousse topped with osetra caviar and concealing, way down at the bottom, luscious chunks of smoked sturgeon, a happy reward for those who dig deep. In the nightly courtship ritual of dining, most chefs offer a small but tasteful gemstone, but Edward Brown, the Sea Grill's longtime executive chef, is looking for big-time romance on the first date. The sturgeon starter is a Joan Collins-league diamond.</p>
        <p>Like Ms. Collins, the Sea Grill has had some work done. A refiguring of the Rockefeller Center concourse has made it smaller, and a redesign by Adam Tihany has given it a cooler, cleaner and snappier appearance. Large cobalt-blue cubes near the entrance give off an aloof, luxurious glow, and cheery-looking circles on the floor suggest Champagne bubbles, or some new international symbol indicating a happy mood.</p>
        <p>The main draw remains unchanged. Look out the windows and you see the golden figure of Prometheus, splashed by colored jets of water. In winter, skaters circle the ice. In warm weather, the rink is an outdoor extension of the restaurant, with canvas umbrellas and potted shrubs. The view disguises some serious drawbacks. The Sea Grill occupies an awkward, uncomfortable space, long and narrow, and the underground concourse looks gloomy and abandoned at night. But the outdoor view is priceless.</p>
        <p>Like the new design, the Sea Grill's menu aims at a new target: casual luxury. Much of the menu, with trimmed-back prices, has a brasserie feel to it, with heaping, almost alarmingly abundant shellfish platters, and a changing daily menu of day-boat fish that are simply grilled, sauteed or seared, Mediterranean style, a la plancha, on a thin steel grill, and served with wilted arugula and a lobster coral emulsion. In a clever touch, the menu prints the name of the boat each fish comes from, and where the fish was caught. It's one thing to poke your fork into a fillet of red snapper, another to know that it comes straight off the 40 Roses, from the Florida reefs.</p>
        <p>There's a fresh new breeze blowing over the rest of the menu as well, with the accent on vibrant flavors and simple preparations. Fat, rosy mussels come in a subtly spiced Thai curry broth. A translucent sheet of striped bass carpaccio needs no more than a sprinkling of baby cilantro and a slick of olive oil and lime juice to come alive. Ruby-colored dice of salmon belly cured in sea salt glisten invitingly, garnished with slivers of radish and lemon zest. As a tartare, it gets a raw egg -- a tiny speckled quail egg that's cracked at the table and poured into a shallow depression in the top of the fish.</p>
        <p>Scallop ceviche, marinated in tropical fruit juices, was muddled and sweet, however, and lobster chowder, crowded with potato, leeks and celery, was goopy and bland. And grilled sardines, served with a pleasingly tangy-sweet red-onion marmalade, suffered from an overdose of sherry vinegar.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown made a renowned crab cake at the old Sea Grill. It returns, a lumpy-looking thing, more ball than patty, displaying the rough-hewn virtues that distinguish a real crab cake from a thousand prettified pretenders. The breading is fine-textured and thinly applied. The cake itself is 97 percent crab and nothing but. The accompanying grainy mustard sauce bites just enough to underline the sweetness of the meat. Of course, the crab itself must carry the production. On one visit it was sublime. On another it was nearly tasteless.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brown, one of those chefs who know when enough is enough, leaps right over the boredom hurdle with his salmon, pairing it with a shocking-green pea puree, so fresh that it gives off a little whiff of rain-drenched earth.</p>
        <p>As a tactical move, the sturgeon showstopper may be a slight mistake, setting up unrealistic expectations. When Mr. Brown merely pleases, it can seem a little disappointing. There's nothing wrong with his halibut and tiny clams, for example, or his grilled sea scallops served with Peruvian lima beans, bright scraps of piquillo pepper and baby artichokes. Both dishes are fine. But I felt a little restless working my way through them.</p>
        <p>Someone in the kitchen is terribly infatuated with a dessert billed as ''palette of sorbets,'' because it was sent out to my table, unsolicited, on three occasions. It comes on a shiny silver platter shaped like a painter's palette, with a half dozen tiny ice cream cones placed in the holes. Each cone holds a marble-size scoop of sorbet in a Kodachrome color and a bonus chunk of chocolate in the base. As a tourist pleaser, this one is hard to beat, but it gets serious competition from the mile-high chocolate parfait, served on a giant plate with a silhouette of the New York skyline executed in powdered cocoa. I preferred the more modest honey vanilla panna cotta, with a tiny triangle of ricotta cheese tart, and fresh lemon confit. It didn't eclipse the sturgeon, but it would probably take Michelle Kwan executing a triple axel on the rink to do that.</p>
