        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani spent most of yesterday consulting with doctors to determine his cancer treatment, then returned to City Hall late in the day to review his options. There was no hint on whether he would remain in the race for the  Senate against Hillary Rodham Clinton, but advisers said a decision would come later this week.</p>
        <p>''I am feeling pretty good under the circumstances,'' Mr. Giuliani said to a small group of reporters on the City Hall steps.</p>
        <p>Senior advisers at City Hall spent much of the day asking one another what they thought the mayor would do. Nobody claimed to know. But there were two prevailing views.</p>
        <p>One, that the mayor would get out of the race because there were too many complications in his life, specifically his prostate cancer; his female friend, Judith Nathan; his pending separation from his wife; and his wife's suggestion last week that Mr. Giuliani had had a relationship with another woman, Cristyne Lategano-Nicholas, when she was his  communications director. Mr. Giuliani and Ms. Lategano-Nicholas have denied the accusation.</p>
        <p>Two, that he would stay in the race, because withdrawing this late would ruin his political future by forever incurring the wrath of state and national Republicans, who would blame him for making it easier for Mrs. Clinton to capture the Senate seat. State Republicans, who must nominate a Senate candidate on May 30, are increasingly exasperated with Mr. Giuliani for taking this long to make a decision. The mayor announced that he had prostate cancer on April 27.</p>
        <p>''He has no choice but to run,'' said George Arzt, a political consultant to Democrats and Republicans. ''This is not the Duke of Windsor giving up the throne for the woman he loves.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Mrs. Clinton's advisers, who were in Albany watching the State Democratic Party nominate her as its candidate for Senate, said they had no fear of running against Representative Rick A. Lazio of western Suffolk County, the emerging choice of the Republicans should Mr. Giuliani not run.</p>
        <p>''He may smile like a moderate, but he votes like a conservative,'' said one of Mrs. Clinton's advisers. The adviser asserted that Mr. Lazio, who supports a ban on a form of late term abortion and who allied himself with Newt Gingrich when he was speaker of the House, is out of touch with many New York voters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio would not discuss his plans yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani has no public events scheduled for today, and is to continue reviewing his plans. Donna Hanover, the mayor's wife, is expected to return later in the day to Gracie Mansion after a trip she made with the couple's two children to visit her parents in California.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hanover was stunned when Mr. Giuliani announced without her knowledge last week that he was seeking a separation, but she has since spoken to him by phone about his cancer and their children. Yesterday Ms. Hanover's press secretary, Joannie Danielides, said her was ''sad and reflective.''</p>
        <p>A mayoral adviser said Mr. Giuliani had spoken to perhaps a dozen prostate cancer experts, both in New York City and beyond.</p>
        <p>Advisers said it appeared that Mr. Giuliani would undergo his treatment in New York City, and that he was still uncertain whether he would choose surgery or radiation. At his news conference on Monday, Mr. Giuliani said he wavered on his treatment options.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes I wake up and I think one way will be best, and other times I wake up and think another way would be best,'' Mr. Giuliani said.</p>
        <p>Doctors say most men of Mr. Giuliani's age, 55, have surgery. They also say many men of his age who have surgery return to work after three or four weeks.</p>
        <p>Last night, Mr. Giuliani left City Hall shortly before 8 and indicated that he had not reached a decision. ''I don't know what direction I'm going in,'' he said. ''When I know the direction, I'll tell you.''</p>
