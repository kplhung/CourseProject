        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas has reignited the debate over the future of Social Security and whether it is a good idea to allow individuals to invest some of their payroll taxes in the stock market.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Mr. Bush provided few specifics, saying they would be worked out in bipartisan negotiations.</p>
        <p>So supporters and critics were left talking yesterday in the same generalities that have dominated the debate for years. And voters were still a long way from being able to figure out how they might be affected and whether a change would be beneficial.</p>
        <p>Still, the announcement has signaled a change in the debate. Although Vice President Al Gore has attacked the idea as inherently risky, the concept of investing some money from payroll taxes in the stock market seemed to be more acceptable today than it was several years ago.</p>
        <p>William Shipman, a principal at State Street Global Advisers who is co-chairman of the Cato Institute program on Social Security and a proponent of individual Social Security accounts, said, ''I think that we are coming closer together; the idea that there should be some stock market investment was not in the cards six years ago.''</p>
        <p>Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who opposes the idea of individuals investing their payroll taxes in the stock market, agreed. ''The idea of investing in the stock market is right,'' Mr. Aaron said. ''It's a good idea to increase the return as much as possible.''</p>
        <p>But he wants the government to do the investing, not individuals, a position President Clinton once proposed. ''The problem with the individual accounts is that they waste money on needless administrative costs,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Aaron's comment indicated, debate over who does the investing, and how, will continue. And that is where the lack of specifics undermines any analysis.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shipman, for example, would not comment on how Mr. Bush's proposal dealt with the cost of administering the Social Security accounts of private investors because it did not provide enough detail.</p>
        <p>But the issue is important: will the costs of running the private accounts by Wall Street firms or mutual fund companies be so high that they will significantly reduce the returns that the individual would get from those accounts?</p>
        <p>''It is not a necessary condition that administrative costs eat up returns,'' Mr. Shipman said. ''It depends on how you design the system.''</p>
        <p>He said he has designed a system with very low costs, ranging from two-tenths of 1 percent to three-tenths of 1 percent of the assets in the account.</p>
        <p>John Mueller, a principal at Lehrman Bell Mueller Cannon Inc., a financial market forecasting company in Chevy Chase, Md., argued that the cost would be much higher.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mueller, a onetime supporter of privatizing the entire Social Security System, noted that the administrative costs for stock mutual funds in 1998, according to the Investment Company Institute, were 1.35 percent of the assets in the funds.</p>
        <p>He and others argued that both the administrative costs and the transition costs for shifting to a system with private accounts would consume much of the additional return for many investors. Mr. Mueller's studies contend that investors would be better off under the existing system than the numerous versions that have been proposed.</p>
        <p>He also faulted Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush for not developing proposals that he said would actually deal with the solvency of Social Security. The system will start paying out more in benefits than it is collecting in payroll taxes in 2015.</p>
        <p>''Neither Gore nor Bush have a plan for balancing the system,'' Mr. Mueller said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shipman dismissed the issue of the transition costs. He argued that if nothing is done to finance Social Security properly, ''there is a transition cost and that is, reasonably, the unfunded liability of the system -- $3 trillion to $8 trillion.''</p>
        <p>So, he said, the cost of a transition to a new system -- which some suggest would top $1 trillion -- must be compared to the cost of doing nothing about the current system.</p>
        <p>Among other issues that have not been addressed was how investors who build private Social Security accounts would be treated when they retire. Will they get both the return from their individual account and the benefits that accrued from the rest of their payroll deductions?</p>
        <p>Mr. Aaron said that a proposal for individual Social Security accounts that had been studied by the House Ways and Means Committee would allow retirees to keep what gave them the largest return -- the benefits based on payroll deductions or the benefits based on individual accounts.</p>
        <p>He said that an analysis of this proposal showed that only 5 percent of the money from the individual accounts actually went to beneficiaries. The rest went back into the Social Security system and would be used, he said, to help pay off the transition costs.</p>
        <p>And what benefits would a retiree get -- and how would the Social Security system cover them -- if the retiree was allowed, as Mr. Bush proposed, to pass on the assets in the individual accounts to his or her heirs?</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush will also face another nagging question: why does he put so much faith in the stock market if his chief economic adviser, Lawrence B. Lindsey, is so bearish?</p>
        <p>Almost two years ago, Mr. Lindsey said that he had sold all of his equity holdings because stock prices were overvalued. At the time, the Dow Jones industrial average was around 8,500. Despite this year's almost 5 percent sell-off, the Dow closed yesterday at 10934.57.</p>
