        <p>Astoria Graphics is a financial and commercial printing company that has been operating in buildings owned by Trinity Church Real Estate for the last 50 or so years. And it will continue to do so as a result of an unusual deal under which it gave up space at an extraordinarily favorable rental rate in one building in return for space in another Trinity location at a higher, but still favorable, rate.</p>
        <p>Astoria, a family-owned company in its fourth generation, is fortunate compared with other companies, many of which have been forced out of Manhattan by rising rents and the desire of landlords to replace manufacturing with office tenants. But more than good fortune was involved, executives on both sides agree. Astoria has substantially converted from traditional methods to new forms of electronic printing that have little of the noise and vibration that make office tenants reluctant to share buildings with printers.</p>
        <p>''We are a digital manufacturing company,'' said Ronald D. Koff, the president of Astoria. ''We do not have heavy, vibrating equipment.''</p>
        <p>Steven D. Heyman, director of commercial leasing for Trinity Real Estate, which is owned by the Parish of Trinity Church, said: ''Office tenants can't live next to or above the noise of a conventional printer. But Ron is in the brave new world of printing, and he doesn't make much noise.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Koff said he had grown up in Trinity-owned buildings, first at 435 Hudson Street and later at 75 Varick Street. But great change has come to 75 Varick, which Trinity is marketing as 1 Hudson Square. Responding to the strength of the office market in Manhattan, the church has invested nearly $70 million to convert it from light manufacturing to Class A offices.</p>
        <p>With asking rental rates in the building now topping $50 a square foot annually, Trinity officials were eager to retrieve the 15,000 square feet occupied by Astoria, all the more because the company was operating under an old lease and paying just $6 a square foot.</p>
        <p>Mr. Koff said he was willing to move because he needed more space. But he said he was intent on staying in Manhattan and not following the printing companies that had departed for New Jersey and the city's other boroughs.</p>
        <p>''We thought it was prudent to stay in Manhattan,'' Mr. Koff said. ''Clients like to see the plant, even if they only spend a few minutes walking through it. It's good to be close to your customers.''</p>
        <p>The changes in Lower Manhattan, particularly the influx of dot-com companies, Internet service providers and telecommunications companies, provided a powerful incentive to stay, said Mitchell Koff, Ronald's brother and co-president of the company. ''They have enveloped the area and are a big part of our business.''</p>
        <p>In addition, he said, the presence of the high-tech companies meant that there was a high-capacity telecommunications infrastructure already installed in the area, which is important to printers who now receive much of their source material as electronic files over the Internet.</p>
        <p>But finding suitable space in Manhattan proved to be difficult. ''Landlords want new-economy companies such as dot-coms, not printers,'' said Andrew P. Sachs, a director of Insignia/ESG and the broker for Astoria.</p>
        <p>After failing to find what the company was looking for, Mr. Sachs said,  he went back to Trinity's managers and asked if there was a way for Astoria to stay in the church's portfolio of 5.5 million square feet of space. Although its property was once occupied almost entirely by industrial tenants, Trinity has in recent years converted much of it to office use.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the three parties worked out a deal that included buying out the last three years of Astoria's deeply below-market lease at 75 Varick Street and having the company move to 30,000 square feet of space in another Trinity-owned building at 225 Varick Street.</p>
        <p>Since buying out the old lease would have required a substantial payment by Trinity to Astoria, the value of that payment was transferred to 225 Varick. As a result, the printing company is paying $18 a square foot for 10 years in a building where asking rents are in the range of $40 a square foot.</p>
        <p>''It was a huge benefit for Trinity to get Astoria out of 75 Varick without having to write a check,'' Mr. Sachs said. And the printing company benefits from getting below-market rent. ''This is a good deal for both sides,'' Mr. Sachs said.</p>
        <p>Ronald Koff said the company was now planning for the move north on Varick Street, which will take one to two weeks. ''It's not something you want to do very often,'' he said.</p>
