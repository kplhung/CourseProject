        <p>Posted: Wednesday, May 17, 8:06 a.m.</p>
        <p>THIS JUST IN: ME!</p>
        <p>By Jed Stinger</p>
        <p>At 6:15 this morning, Jed Stinger, an up-and-coming investigative media-journalist, rolled off his futon, fired up his laptop and listened to the bingbongs of his modem announce the new day. He began the hard work of research by typing ''Jed Stinger'' into a search engine to see what turned up.</p>
        <p>Paydirt. Yesterday's lead story posted on www.mediawatercooler.com -- ''JED STINGER SCORES LUNCH AT JUDSON GRILL WITH BOOK AGENT FROM WILLIAM MORRIS'' -- had been hyperlinked on www.medialunchshmoozers.com.</p>
        <p>It was just the kind of heat he had been trying to generate, buoying his hope that his book proposal for ''The Inside Story on How a Hot Young Media-Journalist Published His First Book on the Media'' might be published after all. If not, he would have to retreat to his fallback topic: ''The Inside Story on How a Hot Young Media-Journalist Never Got His Book on the Media Published,'' which he envisioned as a more modest trade paperback.</p>
        <p>But Jed Stinger also had a new project in mind: a big think piece about the media's fascination with the media. As an investigative media-journalist, he had long been fascinated by the subject. Why are the media so fascinated with the media? When did the media's fascination with the media begin? Is the media's coverage of the media's fascination with the media affected by the fascination itself? Each question was more interesting than the next.</p>
        <p>His angle was innovative as well: tracing the origins of Jed Stinger's fascination with the media's fascination with the media. Stinger knew that this was the piece that only he could write.</p>
        <p>Stinger hoped that his article might find placement on a media-savvy site like Slate, Salon or Inside.com. But he also knew that the rejection of his piece might also make news on salonscuttlebutt.com, slatescoop.com or insideinside.com. Stinger could actually feel a palpable buzz, until he discovered he had mistakenly set his beeper to vibrate.</p>
        <p>Stinger felt proud. ''This is exactly the kind of journalism I've longed to do since the early days of my career,'' he said as he waited for his Pop-Tart to cool.</p>
        <p>It was a career now well into its sixth month. Stinger's meteoric rise had been well documented. In November, he had operated the deep fryer at the NBC commissary, but he found quick notoriety with a posting on www.msnbc/messageboard/media exposing the rank hypocrisy of Tom Brokaw. Brokaw, Stinger revealed, still enjoyed a daily dose of onion rings despite bragging about his devotion to the Atkins diet on Conan O'Brien. This story was the lead headline on mediabigcheese.com for nine hours straight, establishing Stinger as the media darling that he is today.</p>
        <p>Despite this scoop, Stinger found no takers for his meta-media fascination piece. All the media Web pages were preoccupied with the parlor game of guessing the author of Joe Klein's new book.</p>
        <p>As Stinger stared out the window of his studio apartment, sipping the day's third cup of coffee, he found this development discouraging.</p>
        <p>''Honestly, it makes me wonder why I ever got into serious journalism in the first place.''</p>
