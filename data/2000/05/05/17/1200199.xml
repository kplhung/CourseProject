        <p>A team of investigators has arrived in this fire-stricken region to help determine whether the National Park Service acted responsibly when it ignited a blaze that is still burning out of control in the tinder-dry hillsides and canyons here.</p>
        <p>The investigators, who are to release preliminary findings on Thursday, are examining one of the nation's most destructive wildfires in recent years. The fire has already burned 46,000 acres and more than 400 homes and damaged parts of Los Alamos National Laboratory, the nation's largest nuclear laboratory.</p>
        <p>With afternoon winds reaching 50 miles an hour, fire officials were worried that the blaze would spread even farther, perhaps touching off fires in areas like the Santa Clara Canyon, a densely wooded area that is a favorite of many hikers. Among the concerns are lands that include archaeological sites.</p>
        <p>It has been 12 days since the fire was touched off by officials of the National Park Service in what was intended to be a controlled burn to clear away underbrush that could feed a rampaging natural blaze.</p>
        <p>The federal investigation seeks to determine why the fire was started despite forecasts by the National Weather Service of high winds and low humidity that could make the fire difficult to control. On the six-point Haines index, used to help measure volatility, the Weather Service estimated conditions at 6.</p>
        <p>Park Service officials have said they considered all the factors before deciding to go ahead with the burn, including the density of the growth, the moisture in the wood, the relative humidity, the temperature and the wind speed.</p>
        <p>Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt is expected to travel here on Thursday to announce the results of the investigation, which could be deeply embarrassing to federal officials.</p>
        <p>Investigators include representatives from the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department, the Santa Clara and San Ildefonso Indian pueblos, the National Weather Service and the United States Forest Service.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, thousands of residents returned to this fire-devastated city today, finding smoke lingering in the air and most stores closed.</p>
        <p>At the height of the fire, all 11,000 residents of Los Alamos and 14,000 people from surrounding communities were ordered out of their homes.</p>
        <p>Twenty percent of Los Alamos was still off-limits. Entire neighborhoods were burned by a fire that left the few trees still standing looking like blackened toothpicks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Babbitt and his aides have defended the decision to start the fire, saying that such actions are necessary to clear out brush.</p>
        <p>''The investigative team that we have formed will help us to understand what went wrong, and to determine if our prescribed fire policy is sound and the established procedures are adequate,'' Mr. Babbitt said in a statement.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman, Joan Anzelmo, said investigators would try to retrace steps taken when the fire was set on May 4, and immediately after.</p>
        <p>Among the issues investigators will examine are whether there was an urgent need to address the danger of future fires and whether other federal agencies, particularly the Forest Service, responded promptly to a Park Service request for help once the controlled blaze began to burn out of control.</p>
        <p>Park Superintendent Roy Weaver, who has taken responsibility for the  blaze, has been placed on paid leave pending the outcome of the investigation.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the Interior Department said that about 1 percent of prescribed fires had escape the intended boundaries. In the last five years, the Park Service has had 14 such escapes in 1,153 fires. This year, the spokesman added, the Park Service has had 2 escapes out of 102 fires, including the one here.</p>
