        <p>Vice President Al Gore has assembled a large team of foreign policy advisers whose members could form the national security nucleus of a Gore administration.</p>
        <p>The current role of the advisory group is somewhat nebulous, however, since Mr. Gore has never relied on outsiders for advice on foreign policy, and the new panel has not yet contributed much of substance to his campaign.</p>
        <p>The vice president has great faith in his own national security experience and instincts. He has a close, 20-year relationship with his national security alter ego, Leon Fuerth, through whom all foreign policy information flows. The vice president has participated in every major national security debate over the past decade and has access to intelligence and foreign policy expertise throughout the government.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gore believes he needs to hear fresh voices on foreign policy, several Gore aides say, and he has begun to assemble a group of advisers who can address foreign policy questions during the campaign and assist in the transition should Mr. Gore win in November.</p>
        <p>The vice president's advisory group now includes 25 people, many of whom are veterans of the early years of the Clinton administration, and the list of experts is expected to swell to include as many as 100 names over the next several weeks.</p>
        <p>The advisory board will someday provide material for speeches and position papers, but for now the group appears to exist chiefly as the foreign policy arm of a government-in-waiting.</p>
        <p>The panel includes a number of respected academics, former ambassadors and former subcabinet officers, but its members are less well known than Gov. George W. Bush's team of foreign policy advisers, who call themselves the Vulcans after the Greek god of fire and the forge.</p>
        <p>The Bush group includes Paul D. Wolfowitz, Richard L. Armitage, Richard Perle, Robert B. Zoellick and Stephen J. Hadley, all of whom served in senior national security posts in the Reagan and Bush administrations. Mr. Bush also consults with Richard B. Cheney, the former secretary of defense, and George P. Shultz, the former secretary of state. Condoleezza Rice, a former top Russia specialist at the National Security Council, coordinates the Bush foreign policy advisory team.</p>
        <p>''Bush needs them,'' said Marc C. Ginsberg, a longtime friend of President Clinton who served as envoy to Morocco from 1994 to 1998 and who is now one of two coordinators of the Gore foreign policy group. ''He needs the best possible A-list of foreign policy advisers to compensate for his lack of experience and knowledge. Al Gore doesn't suffer from the same deficiencies.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's group includes former Senator James Sasser, who was ambassador to China from 1996 to 1999; Laura D'Andrea Tyson, the former head of the National Economic Council; Joan E. Spero, former under secretary of state for economic affairs, and Ashton B. Carter and Graham T. Allison, Harvard professors who served at the Pentagon in President Clinton's first term. Mel Levine, a former Democratic congressman from Los Angeles, Robert E. Hunter, a former ambassador to NATO, and Richard N. Gardner, whose government experience dates to the Kennedy administration, are also on the list.</p>
        <p>Their role remains indistinct and there is little evidence that Mr. Gore will turn to them for foreign policy guidance any time soon. Unlike the Bush group, they are not holding regular briefings for the vice president, who is as broadly knowledgeable about foreign policy as anyone in the Democratic Party. They have not been canvassed for policy advice or speech drafts. Nor are they authorized to speak to the press on behalf of the Gore campaign. The list of their names was produced only after repeated requests from a reporter.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, competition for spots on the list is fierce because the group is seen as the farm team for senior jobs in a Gore administration, should the vice president win in November. Serving on the ad hoc Gore committee is also a prestigious resume addition for the part-time advisers, many of whom also advise private clients at the same time they give foreign policy counsel to the Gore campaign.</p>
        <p>Part of the work of Mr. Ginsberg and his co-director, Bruce W. Jentleson, director of the Terry Sanford Institute of Public Policy at Duke University, is to screen potential members of the advisory group for conflicts of interest. They said that nobody who had pending business before the government or who was a registered lobbyist for a foreign country would be invited to join the group.</p>
        <p>Since returning from Morocco in 1998, Mr. Ginsberg, a lawyer, has gone into business raising capital for small firms and advising companies on doing business in North Africa and the Middle East. He said he did not represent any foreign governments, nor does his name show up on the Justice Department's list of registered foreign agents.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ginsberg said he had tried to help Gerber Products build a baby formula factory in Gaza with Israeli and Palestinian participation, but the project never got off the ground. This week Mr. Ginsberg was in Morocco to speak at a conference on electronic commerce sponsored by Havas MediMedia, the health care information division of a French advertising company.</p>
        <p>The policy of keeping lobbyists off the advisory panel may be hard to enforce, since some of those on the list, including Mr. Levine, work at large law firms that do some lobbying.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jentleson, who served in the State Department's office of policy planning early in the Clinton administration, said Mr. Gore was reaching beyond the Beltway for fresh ideas. He said Mr. Gore depended on Mr. Fuerth and Samuel R. Berger, the White House national security adviser, for day-to-day foreign policy guidance. Mr. Gore also consults regularly with Richard C. Holbrooke, the United Nations ambassador, whom many consider the leading candidate for secretary of state in a Gore administration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore wants to hear a range of voices as he begins to formulate an approach to global affairs that may at times differ from that of Mr. Clinton, Mr. Jentleson said. But the members of the group are well within the mainstream of the Democratic Party, generally supporting global engagement, protection of the environment and free trade, he added.</p>
        <p>The panel is being assembled with an eye toward quickly staffing a Gore administration, Mr. Jentleson said. ''By asking them to join this group we're not making any promises, he said. ''But if Gore wins the election, it's a lot better to start on Wednesday with a group of people you know than to start looking at a pile of resumes.''</p>
        <p>Foreign policy veterans and even some advisers to Mr. Gore suggest that the group is largely window-dressing at this point, assembled in part to make it look as though Mr. Gore is not dependent wholly on his own foreign policy ideas and those of Mr. Fuerth. Membership on the panel also gives foreign policy thinkers in the Democratic Party a stake in a victory by the vice president in November.</p>
        <p>''Every campaign I've ever heard of does this,'' said a foreign policy expert who has advised several campaigns and who insisted that his name not be printed. ''But I can say that I've never heard of a single instance of a paper from that system making its way to the candidate.''</p>
        <p>He said that Mr. Fuerth tightly controlled what reached Mr. Gore and that the two of them made all important decisions with little outside advice. Mr. Gore did not draw on the advisory group in preparing his most recent address on foreign policy, delivered on May 1 in Boston, aides said. The vice president wrote much of the speech himself, with assistance from Mr. Fuerth and other members of the White House national security staff, they said. In the speech, Mr. Gore called for an activist foreign policy of ''forward engagement'' and criticized Mr. Bush for hewing to what he called an obsolete cold-war mentality.</p>
        <p>The advisory group structure serves one useful purpose: bypassing the limitations placed on political activity by government employees. Most full-time government workers cannot engage in political activity, although certain senior advisers like Mr. Fuerth are exempt from the rule.</p>
        <p>''I cannot use members of the vice president's national security staff or others on the federal payroll to provide political advice for the campaign,'' Mr. Fuerth said. ''I need an external skeleton of people to provide advice for me so I can provide advice for the vice president.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fuerth said the outside advisers would become more active as the campaign progressed, serving as surrogate speakers, drafting speeches and responding to press questions on national security matters. But they will never serve as the foreign policy ''brain'' of the Gore operation. That job is already taken, Mr. Fuerth said.</p>
        <p>''Everyone needs bright minds,'' Mr. Fuerth said, ''but I could drop dead tomorrow and the vice president could keep going for quite some time based simply on what he personally knows and understands.''</p>
