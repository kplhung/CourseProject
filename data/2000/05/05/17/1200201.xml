        <p>The cackle could be heard from clear across the gymnasium, a laugh that had all the subtlety of a churning locomotive.</p>
        <p>Bill Russell took purposeful strides across the court and into an adjacent room, and sat down next to a younger man almost as tall as himself, behind a pair of microphones and in front of a National Basketball Association banner.</p>
        <p>''There's not anyone on this planet that's ever seen you play who doubts what you want,'' Russell said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Alonzo Mourning gazed at him admiringly, the way most impressionable 12-year-olds now look at him.</p>
        <p>''I want two things for you.</p>
        <p>''A championship,'' Russell began, before a long pause, ''and joy.</p>
        <p>''Because one without the other, it doesn't work.''</p>
        <p>Mourning nodded with reverence. Enjoy the game more, he was gently told. Stop treating basketball as the epic struggle your coach so often makes it out to be. Run, gun, have fun. And while you're at it, win an N.B.A. title.</p>
        <p>This is easy to say for Russell, the greatest team player in the history of American sport -- 11 championships in 13 season with the Boston Celtics. He anchored an N.B.A. era, played on the most talented team in the league.</p>
        <p>Mourning, the All-Star center whom Russell presented with his second consecutive defensive player of the year award, is not as fortunate. Mourning's Miami Heat is much like Patrick Ewing's Knicks in the 1990's: determined but hardly dynastic, flawed in ways that may prevent Mourning from feeling the joy that accompanies a title.</p>
        <p>Miami Coach Pat Riley introduced Russell, recounted the Hall of Fame center's career achievements and ended with ''but more importantly, he never really experienced the misery of losing.''</p>
        <p>Riley laughed, knowing humor sometimes best camouflages the truth.</p>
        <p>''I'm also honored to be able to be here because I do believe in Alonzo Mourning,'' Riley said. ''If there is anyone who has exemplified him in a way -- the shot-blocking, the defensive mannerisms and the heart and courage to really want to win . . . ''</p>
        <p>Mourning, a 6-foot-10-inch center who plays bigger than many of the 7-footers he must defend, works out year-round, sculpting a massive frame that would make most of Russell's contemporaries shy away from contact.</p>
        <p>Like Russell's philosophy, Mourning believes winning is paramount. But the parallels end there. Russell had an abundance of help; Mourning straps the Heat's world on his shoulders each night.</p>
        <p>''One thing that it has to be, it has to be fun,'' Russell said. ''It's so serious. And the game to me was always fun. It's like when those little guys come in there with their weak stuff.''</p>
        <p>Mourning smiled as Russell unleashed another cackling belly laugh. He was asked if he could have gotten off a shot against Russell.</p>
        <p>''I would have tried to,'' Mourning said.</p>
        <p>Russell replied: ''Sometimes. Oh, he would have got his shot off. But we would've won the game.''</p>
        <p>They resembled a wise, old uncle and a humble nephew sitting there: a dignified Russell, wearing a charcoal gray blazer and slacks with a light blue golf shirt, his salt-and-pepper beard and wire-rimmed glasses. The casual Mourning looked very Miami: the long designer shorts and a tan, linen short-sleeve shirt, leather sandals and that smooth, young complexion.</p>
        <p>''I've got to thank my teammates for letting their men blow by them,'' Mourning joked before he held up the trophy and posed for pictures with Russell.</p>
        <p>''I have a satellite dish, too,'' he said to Russell. ''I've watched the classic sports network quite a bit and I've seen you play. It's amazing how the game has changed. Just watching how you control the game with your presence on the court is amazing to me.''</p>
        <p>Mourning gazed longingly at the two rings on Russell's fingers, looking at them like you would at the new bike in the toy store window that you know your parents cannot afford.</p>
        <p>On the left hand, Russell wore the first of his 11 championship rings, won in 1957. On the right, he wore the ring from his last title, 1969.</p>
        <p>''I've experienced a lot of joy in this game,'' Mourning said. ''But one of the enjoyments I haven't experienced is winning it all. That's why I look down at your hands, looked at your rings.''</p>
        <p>''It's on its way,'' Russell said.</p>
        <p>''I'm patient,'' Mourning said. ''I'm getting a little impatient, but I'm patient.</p>
        <p>''I take this game very seriously. You might not see the joy in the game, especially when I'm out there on the floor. But I am having a good time. I think I'm having a better time now than all of my career, because I think the game has slowed down a whole lot more for me. It's becoming a little bit easier for me.''</p>
        <p>He allowed a half-smile and took another peek at Russell's large hands.</p>
