        <p>An Australian astrophysicist died suddenly of undetermined causes Friday at the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station, a research center operated by the National Science Foundation, and his body must remain there until the Southern winter ends in October. It was only the third death at the pole in nearly 35 years.</p>
        <p>While the death of the astrophysicist, Rodney Marks, is not thought to be related to the harsh conditions at the pole, it is a reminder that scientists operating the growing number of experiments there must contend with a perilous isolation when medical emergencies arise.</p>
        <p>Individuals at the pole during the southern winter are trapped by the severe weather, no matter how ill they might become. Last year, a doctor at the station, Jerri L. Nielsen, found a lump in her breast and treated herself until she could be flown out at winter's end.</p>
        <p>Dr. Marks, who was 32, had complained of severe breathing difficulties and reported to the station's physician, said Adair Lane, an astronomer at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory.</p>
        <p>''His condition did improve for a while,'' Dr. Lane said. ''And he was conscious and was able to converse with the people attending him. And suddenly his heart stopped and all the resuscitation failed.''</p>
        <p>The cause of death will probably not be determined until the body is removed and an autopsy performed, said Karl Erb, director of the foundation's Office of Polar Programs.</p>
        <p>Dr. Marks was ''wintering over'' at the station, with about 10 other scientists and technicians and 40 staff and construction personnel. Projects at the station include measuring ozone in the atmosphere and capturing subatomic particles, neutrinos from space.</p>
        <p>Dr. Marks was operating a submillimeter telescope, which observes radiation from gas clouds around star-forming regions in space.</p>
        <p>Like all people who work at the pole, Dr. Marks passed a battery of physical and psychological tests. He had also wintered there once before.</p>
        <p>The previous two deaths at the pole involved accidents, a foundation spokesman said. In 1980, a worker clearing snow from an air shaft was killed when the snow suddenly collapsed. In 1966, a worker died while an aircraft was being unloaded.</p>
