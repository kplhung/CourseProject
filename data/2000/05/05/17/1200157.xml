        <p>A Near-Carbuncle, Not 'Just a Lump'</p>

        <p>A Near-Carbuncle, Not 'Just a Lump'</p>
        <p>PEGGY NOONAN, who was a speechwriter for Presidents George Bush and Ronald Reagan, quoted Charles, the Prince of Wales, and the actor KEVIN KLINE quoted Shakespeare as they joined the chorus opposing an apartment building planned for the Upper East Side.</p>
        <p>They appeared before the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission yesterday, following in the footsteps of WOODY ALLEN, who testified in February.</p>
        <p>At issue is a 16-story tower that a developer wants to build atop a single-story bank branch at Madison Avenue at East 91st Street. Ms. Noonan quoted Prince Charles, who in 1998 compared the planned extension of the facade of the National Gallery in London to ''a monstrous carbuncle on the face of a much loved and elegant friend.''</p>
        <p>''This is not a monstrous carbuncle,'' she said of the Madison Avenue project, ''but it is a blocker of the sun.''</p>
        <p>The lines from Act V of ''Richard II'' that Mr. Kline recited -- ''How sour sweet music is when time is broke and no proportion kept'' -- served as a counterpoint to a presentation by the architect PAUL BYARD, whose partner CHARLES A. PLATT was the building's main designer. Mr. Byard said the plan was appropriate for the neighborhood and that the tower would not be ''just a lump on the corner.'' JENNIFER J. RAAB, the commission's chairwoman, said the panel would announce a decision on the project next month.</p>
        <p>For Puffy Combs, More Waiting</p>
        <p>The rap impresario SEAN COMBS is getting used to Lower Manhattan. Yesterday, Mr. Combs, known as Puff Daddy or Puffy Combs, was at State Supreme Court in connection with gun possession and bribery charges tied to a shooting at a Times Square club last year. A judge rejected his request for a trial separate from his co-defendant JAMAL BARROW, who has been charged with three counts of attempted murder for firing shots that hit bystanders. Mr. Combs is accused only of displaying a pistol, not firing it.</p>
        <p>Not taking no for an answer, one of Mr. Combs's lawyers, BENJAMIN BRAFMAN, argued that Mr. Combs should be tried immediately. The judge, CHARLES H. SOLOMON, did not agree to such a speedy timetable. He said he would rule on the matter next month.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to start the case today so I can get on with my life,'' Mr. Combs said outside the courtroom.</p>
        <p>The criminal case is not the only matter that is bringing Mr. Combs to court. Jury selection is scheduled to begin next week in a civil case arising from a 1991 stampede at a City College gymnasium during a celebrity basketball game he promoted. Nine young people were trampled to death, and 29 were injured.</p>
        <p>''That's a fraudulent case,'' Mr. Combs said yesterday.</p>
        <p>A Return to NBC In Letterman Land</p>
        <p>So DAVID LETTERMAN is going to have a show on NBC again. Not a talk show, but ''Ed,'' a sitcom created by his executive producer, ROB BURNETT, and a former head writer and supervising producer on ''Late Show,'' JON BECKERMAN.</p>
        <p>This led to a joke by Mr. Burnett -- ''If I had known things were going to work out this well, we never would have stolen the computers on the way out the door at NBC in '93'' -- and for two more ''Late Show'' executive producers, MARIA POPE and BARBARA GAINES. Both are longtime figures in the Letterman universe. Ms. Pope coordinated Mr. Letterman's mother's appearances at the 1994 Winter Olympics; Ms. Gaines has been with him since his 1980 show on NBC and has worked on all 1,810 ''Late Night'' broadcasts on NBC and all 1,405 ''Late Show'' broadcasts on CBS.</p>
        <p>''Ed'' is not the only show Mr. Burnett and Mr. Letterman's production company, Worldwide Pants, have been working on. CBS is expected to announce it is scheduling a Worldwide Pants program starring CHRISTINE BARANSKI and JIM GAFFIGAN as a weather forecaster from Indiana. It is a sitcom, not a biography of Mr. Letterman, who was once a weather forecaster and grew up in Indiana.</p>
