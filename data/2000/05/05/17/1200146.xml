        <p>The National Women's Law Center, a nonprofit research and advocacy group in Washington, said in its report that the military had remade a program once described as a ''ghetto'' of child care -- with long waiting lists, uneven care and costs too high for many military families -- into one providing affordable, high-quality care to more than 200,000 children worldwide.</p>

        <p>The military has so improved its child care system in the past decade that it has become a model for state and national programs, according to a study released today.</p>
        <p>The National Women's Law Center, a nonprofit research and advocacy group in Washington, said in its report that the military had remade a program once described as a ''ghetto'' of child care -- with long waiting lists, uneven care and costs too high for many military families -- into one providing affordable, high-quality care to more than 200,000 children worldwide.</p>
        <p>The military, according to Nancy Duff Campbell, co-president of the center, who discussed the report at a Pentagon briefing, ''transformed a seriously deficient child care system into one that now serves as a model for child care reform nationwide.''</p>
        <p>In those 10 years, the Defense Department and the services created a network of child care centers, family care homes, after-school programs and referral services. The military tripled the number of children in its system and now meets 58 percent of the needs of service members' children requiring care, the study estimated, a level far exceeding that of the civilian child care industry.</p>
        <p>In the last fiscal year, the military spent $339 million for child care, the study found, as the Pentagon realized such services required large subsidies to assure that military families could afford them. Fees are based on the parents' income.</p>
        <p>Ms. Campbell said her group hoped to use the study ''to push the civilian side and say 'these are the things you can do.' ''</p>
        <p>Adequate child care became part of the armed forces' efforts to retain members of the all-volunteer services. The military also realized that quality care was needed to cut the service time lost while parents were home caring for their children.</p>
        <p>''At first there was no money allocated for child care and we had to compete with tanks and weapons for funding,'' recalled M.-A. Lucas, the civilian manager for the Army's child care program.</p>
        <p>The study praised the military for setting caregiver training requirements and improving the wages. Hourly wages for military caregivers start at $8 and rise to $10 after two years. Pay for civilian childcare workers averages $7.13 an hour.</p>
        <p>As a result, staff turnover -- a serious problem in civilian child care centers -- fell from more than 300 percent a year on some bases to less than 30 percent today.</p>
        <p>''This isn't a mere nicety; it's a military necessity,'' said William S. Cohen, the secretary of defense. ''We simply can't afford to have our service members worried about the basic well-being of their families.''</p>
        <p>Also attending the briefing were Senators Christopher Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, and James M. Jefford, Republican of Vermont, sponsors of legislation to raise child care financing in the civilian sector.</p>
        <p>''Child care, as it's offered to our men and women in uniform, is the gold standard,'' Mr. Dodd said. ''You can't do a job well if you're worried about how your infant child is doing in a child care center or where the care is being given. And so this is about as fundamental as it gets.''</p>
