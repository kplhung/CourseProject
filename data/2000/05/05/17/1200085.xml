        <p>Letter from Joseph A Califano Jr, president of National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, says parents who are engaged in their children's lives, set and keep curfews, are religiously involved with their children and send clear and consistent messages about illicit behavior are far likelier to have children who grow up drug-free (May 13 Op-Ed)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Quality Time Is Authority Time'' (Op-Ed, May 13), by Kay S. Hymowitz, is right.</p>
        <p>The comment by President Clinton that she mentions was a reference to our surveys, which have consistently found that the more often 12-  to 17-year-olds have dinner with their parents, the less likely they are to smoke, drink or use illegal drugs. We have always pointed out that this finding should be read as a surrogate for parental love, concern and discipline.</p>
