        <p>CAR models are born, car models grow and change, car models die and disappear. And sometimes -- more and more -- they are born again.</p>
        <p>Sometimes the only thing that returns from the auto graveyard is a name. Sometimes a look comes back, too. In either case, the goal is to turn memory into money.</p>
        <p>''As baby boomers age, there is this idea that a nostalgic name will make them think wistfully of the product,'' said Jim Hall, the vice president of industry analysis for Auto Pacific Inc., a market research firm in Tustin, Calif. ''That's the whole idea behind the Volkswagen Beetle.''</p>
        <p>When Volkswagen recreated the Beetle in 1998, it brought back the car's familiar bubble design (with postmodernist tweaking) and even the flower vase built into the dashboard from 60's Beetles. Volkswagen also renewed the name Beetle, albeit preceded by ''New.'' The car's phenomenal success paved the way for other automakers to lift names from history and slap them on new automobiles.</p>
        <p>Like the New Beetle, many of today's cars with historical names capture the look and intent of their predecessor. Last spring, Jaguar introduced a new S-Type, named after the high-performance 3.8 S-Type of the 60's. Its overall shape, as well as its face, with the prominent vertical-bar grille, are straight from Jaguar's past.</p>
        <p>The Ford Thunderbird, a classic name that was dropped in 1997, is scheduled to return on a model to be introduced in 2001. It promises to bear a striking resemblance to the original 1955 Thunderbird and the classic 1955 to 1957 and 1962 to 1963 models. Like the original, it will be a rear-drive, V-8-powered two-seat roadster and probably available in the same pastel colors as the early versions.</p>
        <p>Nissan, formerly Datsun, vows that the reborn Z car, seen only in rough concept, will maintain the shape that the original Datsun 240Z introduced in 1969. Like the original, it will be a small sports car. The original veered from that spirit later on.</p>
        <p>But many more cars with classic names are a stretch, bearing little resemblance to their ancestors. In many cases, the automakers argue that although there is little similarity in appearance or in driving performance between the new and old, the ''spirit'' remains.</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrysler, for instance, revived its 300 series with the introduction of the Chrysler 300M in 1998. The first 300, introduced in 1955, was quick, thanks to a 300-horsepower engine, which inspired its name. Considered the first American ''muscle'' car, the 300 was followed by 11 low-volume models in succeeding years, each with a letter affixed to the number, culminating in the 300L of 1965. The 300 name was applied later to more mundane cars.</p>
        <p>The current 300M borrows little from the original. It is front-wheel drive and V6-powered, while the original was rear-wheel drive and V8-equipped. Both generations emphasize handling and spirited performance, and, to make that connection, advertisements for the 300M use a black-and-white film of the original model setting speed records at racetracks.</p>
        <p>Chevrolet recently introduced several cars with classic names like Impala, Monte Carlo and Malibu. But they required a vivid imagination to connect the dots to their namesakes.</p>
        <p>To make the connection, Chevrolet used a black-and-white film of Dinah Shore singing ''See the U.S.A. in Your Chevrolet'' on a giant screen at the introduction of its Impala at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit in January. The Impala name spans four decades, in which 13 million were sold and the car went through many changes. Introduced in 1958, the Impala was designed to be a large, affordable family car. The intent of the new Impala is the same, yet it looks different, except for the taillights. Smaller than its namesake, it  has front drive, not rear.</p>
        <p>Ford did not seem to care that anyone made a connection with the past when it introduced the new Mercury Cougar in spring 1998. In fact, the message was clear that the entire Mercury division, exemplified by the Cougar, had shed its reputation for bloated, stodgy cars.</p>
        <p>Vintage and new Cougars are hardly lookalikes. The Cougar name was first used in 1967 on a fancy version of the Ford Mustang. In the intervening three decades, the Cougar has had up to eight lives, returning as hardtop sedans, station wagons and an overgrown coupe, which had the same architecture as the Ford Thunderbird. The new Cougar -- small, sleek and radically styled with sharp edges -- is aimed at body-pierced young men.</p>
        <p>NOT all carmakers are dipping into the past. General Motors' Oldsmobile division has replaced all of its classic names, including the Cutlass. With new names like Alero and Intrigue, the suggestion is that Oldsmobile is headed in a futuristic direction. Buick reportedly will use the name Rendezvous for its future sport utility vehicle, to convey that this is a Buick like none before.</p>
        <p>But the latest concept cars traveling the auto-show circuit suggest that more old names will be resurrected. Chevrolet showed the Nomad, a station-wagon-type vehicle that bore the shape and profile of its 50's antecedent but fits into the market of crossover vehicles, which blur the line between car and truck.</p>
        <p>Pontiac showed a G.T.O., with styling elements recalling the 60's muscle car, including twin hood scoops and a wide stance. Dodge displayed a luxurious version of the Power Wagon, the name used on a crude military-turned-civilian pickup truck of the 40's, the Dodge Charger muscle car and the Chrysler Hemi convertible. Mercedes-Benz  has announced it will put its ultraluxurious Maybach, a past name, into production.</p>
        <p>Cadillac executives are constantly pressed to put the LaSalle name back into service. Could names like Barracuda, Bel Air or Newport be far behind?</p>
        <p>In the end, the name is irrelevant, Mr. Hall, the industry analyst, contends. It is the product that matters. ''A bad car can live with a good name, and a good car can live with a bad name,'' he said. For instance, despite the negative connotations regarding any form of government, the Honda Civic is the best-selling small car in America.</p>
        <p>Conversely, a rock-solid name like the Chevrolet Monte Carlo endured when the cars themselves fell short of the original Monte Carlo's reputation.</p>
        <p>Still, it is hard to imagine that there will ever be a New Edsel.</p>
        <p>Goodbye, Previa. Hello, Sienna</p>
        <p>IN the late 1990's, Honda and Toyota shared a common problem -- poorly selling minivans -- and both decided on radical redesigns. But they took opposite tacks in deciding what to call their new products.</p>
        <p>Toyota dropped the name Previa, which it had given to a minivan that raised eyebrows. The car looked as if it had flown straight out of ''The Jetsons,''  but it failed miserably in the marketplace. The new minivan, which could easily be confused with any other in an elementary-school parking lot, is nothing like the Previa. It is called Sienna, a color that meets the soothing, earth-toned marketing mood of the moment.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Honda kept the Odyssey name when it introduced its new minivan in late 1998, though that version is vastly different from the original. That Odyssey was a small, quirky minivan with hinged doors rather than sliding rear ones. Criticized as extremely underpowered, it never met sales expectations. Like the Toyota, the new Honda minivan moved into the mainstream in terms of design, but unlike Toyota, Honda beefed up the engine. As a result, the Odyssey is in great demand, and consumers are paying more than the list price.</p>
        <p>Honda officials suggested that the company kept the Odyssey name to save time and money on a search and to avoid establishing another name in the marketplace. In the end, it does not really matter what name is used, said Jim Hall, an industry analyst. ''It's known as the Honda minivan.''</p>
