        <p>IN the early 1970's, when I was first learning to cook, there was a popular Massachusetts classic known as American chop suey: elbow macaroni tossed with a tomato sauce containing meat and vegetables. Needless to say, I never knew it to be prepared by people of either Italian or Chinese extraction. And no one I knew was capable of any more than giving an American noodle dish a fake Chinese name.</p>
        <p>Back then, Asian noodles were mysterious. Even now, you might happily eat lo mein or pad Thai in a restaurant, but you would think twice before cooking such exotica at home.</p>
        <p>Yet, Asian noodles, in all their varieties, should be no more daunting than pasta. Most can be treated just like fettuccine, fresh or dried, and some are easier to use. The techniques for Asian noodle dishes are familiar to everyone who cooks, from boiling to stir-frying. And the ingredients needed for sauces are just the Asian equivalents of olive oil, Parmesan and tomatoes: soy sauce, ginger, sesame oil and chilies.</p>
        <p>But Asian noodles can also go into dishes where spaghetti would seem alien, like soups and wok-size pancakes. They have flavors and textures that the best Italian imports can't rival. They can be matched up with any meat, poultry, seafood or vegetable. Using them simply opens up a new realm of possibilities with pasta.</p>
        <p>What is daunting is their sheer numbers. The world of Asian noodles is vast. Most are made with wheat, especially in China, and seem the most like Italian pasta. Chewy, translucent rice noodles are more common in Southeast Asia. Japan produces delicate buckwheat noodles called soba. The clear, bean thread, or cellophane noodle, is made from ground mung beans and is eaten throughout Asia. There are even intriguing noodles made from bean curd, usually called tofu shreds.</p>
        <p>But the most accessible noodles for Western cooks are those made with wheat or with rice.</p>
        <p>Fresh wheat noodles come in varying thicknesses. The most common are thin, vermicelli-like threads, which are what you get when you order a rich, inexpensive, noodle-laden broth in Chinatown, and spaghetti-like strands, which are used for lo mein. If they are white, they are made from wheat and water; if yellow, they contain egg -- and often, food coloring. Depending on shape and texture, they might be called Shanghai noodles, Hong Kong noodles, soup noodles or lo mein. These can be treated similarly; the differences, though real, are subtle. Just as the difference between linguine and bucatini is real but subtle.</p>
        <p>For most dishes, fresh noodles are cooked in boiling water for three or four minutes, until al dente. Dried take about 10 minutes. At that point, the most basic approach is to top them with a simple sauce. But they can also be stir-fried with other ingredients in the familiar lo mein style, or formed into a large cake to be pan-fried until crisp and topped with a sauce.</p>
        <p>The thinnest of the fresh noodles -- the rough equivalent of capellini -- can be added directly to soup, without precooking. Parboiled noodles, usually labeled prepared noodles, can be stir-fried or made into noodle cakes straight from the bag. When simmered, these noodles become tender, softer and a bit gummier than most fresh pasta.</p>
        <p>Dried wheat noodles, treated in much the same way, are even more varied. Some are flavored with spinach, crab, shrimp or lobster, and these add a nice touch when paired with sauces with similar flavors. Some are sold in straight strands, just like spaghetti. Others are twirled into nests of varying shapes and sizes. They are either stark white or beige; a darker color usually means egg has been added. Thicknesses range from hair-thin to fettuccine-like; even these, however, may be labeled vermicelli.</p>
        <p>You can substitute dried Italian pasta for dried wheat pasta, but it tends to be starchier, and the texture is never quite the same. Dried Asian wheat pasta achieves an unusual combination of chewiness and tenderness, and its flavor, if anything, is even blander than Italian pasta. The cooking time is about the equivalent, around 10 minutes for noodles as thick as spaghetti.</p>
        <p>Rice noodles -- the basis of the most popular Thai restaurant dish, pad Thai -- have no equivalent in European cooking. Made from rice powder, and almost always sold dried, they are nearly as convenient as fresh wheat noodles, because they need only to be soaked in hot water for a few minutes to become tender and ready to eat. The texture is elastic, soft and pleasant, and the flavor, though mild, is more pronounced than that of wheat noodles.</p>
        <p>Rice noodles are usually imported and go by many names, even though they are interchangeable: rice stick, rice vermicelli, to name a few. But in every case, they are easily recognized by their grayish-white, translucent appearance. Because of their somewhat irregular shapes, they are never packed in as orderly a fashion as wheat noodles: they are quite long and are packaged folded up over themselves. Once soaked, rice noodles are great stir-fried, in soups or in salads. Two thicknesses are common: very thin and fettuccine-like.</p>
        <p>Fresh rice noodles are not easy to find, but fresh wheat noodles are produced by the ton and sold in Chinatowns nationwide as well as throughout the city in Asian markets, and even in good suburban supermarkets. In Chinatown markets, they are amazingly cheap, as little as 85 cents a bag of about a pound. A good source is Kam Man, a market at 200 Canal Street; the selection of dried noodles is astonishing.</p>
        <p>Whether pale white wheat or yellow egg, fresh wheat noodles are almost always packed in plastic bags of 12 to 16 ounces. They keep for several days in the refrigerator and can be frozen in the package. Defrost them in the refrigerator if you can. If you're really desperate, plunge them, still frozen, into boiling water; just make sure to separate them by stirring as they defrost.</p>
        <p>As for complements for Asian noodles, many ingredients are the same as for Italian pasta, like garlic, scallions and stock. Anyone who cooks Asian dishes probably already has most of the staples. Other necessities include peanut oil, nearly as healthy as olive oil but better tasting with Asian food (keep the oil refrigerated); hoisin and ground bean sauces, the sweet, spicy, soybean pastes that form the basis of the quickest noodle toppings; and chili paste, a fast, convenient way to add heat to any dish. It's nice to have some of the highly flavorful Chinese sausage around, too.</p>
        <p>The recipes here can be varied in many ways. The stir-fry, for example, can include meat or other shellfish, or vegetables. The noodle cake will serve as a crisp base for any juicy stew or stir-fry you can think of (even those with non-Asian flavors).</p>
        <p>The recipe for fresh noodles with brown sauce is in fact the perfectly simple introduction to the world of Asian noodle dishes. It can be made with dried noodles, of course, and you can prepare it with any ground meat or poultry you like. It is the closest authentic relative to American chop suey.</p>
        <p>WHOLE-MEAL CHICKEN NOODLE SOUP, CHINESE STYLE  Time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>6 to 8 cups good chicken stock  10 slices ginger  2 cloves garlic, lightly crushed  1 tablespoon peanut or vegetable oil  1 teaspoon minced garlic  1 1/2 cups chopped cooked chicken or meat  1 cup broccoli florets, snow or snap peas, or green beans, cut into 1-inch pieces  1 pound fresh thin egg noodles  2 tablespoons soy sauce  1 tablespoon Asian sesame oil</p>
        <p>1/2 cup minced scallions.</p>
        <p>1. Heat stock with ginger and garlic to a simmer.</p>
        <p>2. Put oil in a broad, deep skillet or saucepan and turn heat to medium-high. Add garlic, stir, and add meat. Turn heat to high, and cook, stirring occasionally, until meat begins to brown. Add vegetables, and cook, stirring occasionally, about 5 minutes.</p>
        <p>3. Strain, and add 6 cups stock; adjust heat to gentle boil. Add noodles, and cook, stirring, until separate and tender, about 3  minutes. Stir in soy sauce and sesame oil. Taste, and adjust seasonings. Divide soup  among 4 bowls, adding more stock for a soupier mixture. Garnish with scallions, and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>STIR-FRIED RICE NOODLES WITH SHRIMP AND MUSHROOMS  Time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>6 dried shiitake mushrooms (or use fresh, stemmed and sliced)  12 ounces thin rice noodles (vermicelli or stick)  2 tablespoons peanut or vegetable oil  1 tablespoon slivered or minced garlic  12 ounces shrimp, peeled (deveined if you like) and cut into bite-size pieces</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon chili paste or crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste  2 eggs, lightly beaten  3 tablespoons soy sauce, or to taste  2 teaspoons sugar  Stick (or water, or mushroom-soaking liquid) as needed  Salt, optional  1 cup bean sprouts</p>
        <p>1/2 cup torn basil leaves, preferably Thai basil.</p>
        <p>1. Put mushrooms in a small bowl, and cover with boiling water (don't soak fresh mushrooms). Put noodles in a large bowl, and cover with boiling water. Let both sit 5 minutes or so, then drain and slice mushrooms.</p>
        <p>2. Put oil in a large nonstick skillet, and turn  heat to high. Add garlic and stir; add shrimp and cook, stirring occasionally,  about a minute. Stir in the chili paste.</p>
        <p>3. Drain and add noodles. Cook, stirring occasionally, about a minute. Make a well in  center of noodles, and pour in eggs. Scramble, gradually integrating eggs with noodles; this will take less than a minute. Stir in soy sauce and sugar. If noodles look clumpy, add about  1/2 cup liquid to allow them to separate and become saucy (use more liquid if necessary, but do not make mixture soupy). Add salt to taste, then stir in bean sprouts and basil, and serve immediately.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>CRISP NOODLE CAKE WITH SLOW-COOKED RIBS  Time: 3 hours</p>
        <p>2 pounds pork spare ribs, cut into pieces, or beef short ribs</p>
        <p>1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons soy sauce  1 star anise  1 dried chili  5 slices ginger  2 cloves garlic, lightly crushed  2 teaspoons sugar  1 pound fresh egg noodles</p>
        <p>1/2 cup minced scallions  4 tablespoons peanut or vegetable oil.</p>
        <p>1. Combine meat,  1/4 cup soy sauce, star anise, chili, ginger, garlic and sugar with 2 cups water in a skillet just broad enough to hold everything. Bring to a boil, then turn  heat to low, cover, and simmer at least 2 hours, until meat is literally falling off bones. Cool, then strip meat completely off bones. Strain liquid, and chop or shred meat, then recombine both. The texture should be like a thick stew; if it is too soupy, cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until some liquid boils out. If texture is right, cover and keep warm over low heat. (This can be done a day or two in advance; store the sauce, covered, in the refrigerator.)</p>
        <p>2. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add noodles, and cook until tender but not mushy. Drain, then toss with  scallions, remaining soy sauce and 1 tablespoon oil.</p>
        <p>3. About 20 minutes before you're ready to eat, put 2 tablespoons oil in heavy medium to large skillet, preferably nonstick; turn  heat to medium-high. When oil is hot, add  noodle mix, spreading it out evenly and pressing it down.</p>
        <p>4. Cook 2 minutes, then turn heat to medium-low. Continue to cook until cake is holding together and is nicely browned on the bottom, about 10 minutes. Shake cake out onto a plate, cover with another plate, invert both plates and slide cake back into skillet, browned side up. (Add the remaining oil if pan is too dry.)</p>
        <p>5. Cook cake until brown on second side, then top with meat. Cut into eighths or quarters and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 to 8 servings.</p>
        <p>FRESH NOODLES WITH BROWN SAUCE  Time: 20 minutes</p>
        <p>1/2 to  3/4 pound ground pork  1 cup minced scallions  1 tablespoon minced garlic  1 tablespoon peeled and minced ginger  1 cup chicken stock or water  2 tablespoons ground bean sauce  2 tablespoon hoisin sauce  1 tablespoon soy sauce  1 pound fresh egg or wheat noodles  1 tablespoon sesame oil.</p>
        <p>1. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Meanwhile, put a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add pork, crumbling it to bits as you add it and stirring to break up any clumps. Add half the scallions, along with garlic and ginger, and stir. Add stock or water. Stir in bean, hoisin and soy sauces and cook, stirring occasionally, until thick, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat and keep warm.</p>
        <p>2. Add noodles to boiling water and cook, stirring, until tender, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain, and dress with pork mixture. Garnish with remaining scallions, drizzle with sesame oil, and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 3 to 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Using Your Noodle</p>
        <p>FOR those interested in exploring Asian noodles more extensively, here are four reliable guides.</p>
        <p>''The Noodle Shop Cookbook'' by Jacki Passmore (Macmillan, 1994). Pan-Asian, and very good. If you have a specific recipe in mind, it is likely to be here. If you want a survey of noodle dishes, here it is. The 150 recipes tend to be a bit more complex than necessary, but they work.</p>
        <p>''Noodle'' by Terry Durack (Soma Books, 1999). A lovely book, originally published in Australia, with 20 pages of pictures of the most common noodles. The 100 authentic recipes are straightforward; each cross-references the kind of noodle it requires.</p>
        <p>''Asian Noodles'' by Nina Simonds (Hearst, 1997). The most Americanized of the noodle books. It includes a valuable spread of noodle identification pictures, and many recipes are sound, although the recipe writing and layout are awkward.</p>
        <p>''Florence Lin's Complete Book of Chinese Noodles, Dumplings, and Breads'' (Morrow, 1986). Not strictly noodles, but comprehensive, including recipes for making Chinese (and other) noodles at home. For the dedicated cook, a treasure worth tracking down, even though it is out of print.</p>
