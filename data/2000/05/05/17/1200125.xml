      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial on similarities between television program West Wing and current events notes that president on television program battles bravely to reshape Federal Election Commission and ban soft money, while Pres Clinton and Democrats battle only half-heartedly for campaign finance reform; urges Clinton and Sen Tom Daschle to stand firm against Sen Trent Lott's bid to appoint Bradley Smith, opponent of campaign finance laws, to commission</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In this season's final episode of ''West Wing,'' President Josiah Bartlet (played by Martin Sheen) will deal tonight with a downed pilot in Iraq, a balky space shuttle and a battle with Congress over campaign finance reform. As it happens, the last of these issues is unfolding in the real Washington this week, in almost the same way. But while President Bartlet is bravely trying to reshape the Federal Election Commission and ban soft money, President Clinton (played by himself) and the real Democrats are battling only half-heartedly for reform.</p>
        <p>In the real Washington, the fight is over the drive by Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, to place Bradley Smith, a notorious opponent of campaign finance laws, on the Federal Election Commission, where he would be responsible for enforcing those laws. Mr. Lott is offering the Democrats all kinds of incentives to go along. On television, the Senate majority leader (Mr. Lott's counterpart) is trying to block a Democratic effort to make the commission stronger by appointing reformers. He, too, is offering a deal -- let the commission remain weak with its existing members in return for action on a pet Bartlet proposal.</p>

        <p>In this season's final episode of ''West Wing,'' President Josiah Bartlet (played by Martin Sheen) will deal tonight with a downed pilot in Iraq, a balky space shuttle and a battle with Congress over campaign finance reform. As it happens, the last of these issues is unfolding in the real Washington this week, in almost the same way. But while President Bartlet is bravely trying to reshape the Federal Election Commission and ban soft money, President Clinton (played by himself) and the real Democrats are battling only half-heartedly for reform.</p>
        <p>In the real Washington, the fight is over the drive by Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, to place Bradley Smith, a notorious opponent of campaign finance laws, on the Federal Election Commission, where he would be responsible for enforcing those laws. Mr. Lott is offering the Democrats all kinds of incentives to go along. On television, the Senate majority leader (Mr. Lott's counterpart) is trying to block a Democratic effort to make the commission stronger by appointing reformers. He, too, is offering a deal -- let the commission remain weak with its existing members in return for action on a pet Bartlet proposal.</p>
        <p>We have a hunch that President Bartlet will rebuff the Republican deal-makers and carry through on reform. President Clinton and Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader, should stand as firm. They might be pleased to note that, in TV land, President Bartlet's approval ratings have risen with his seizure of the reform banner, just as Senator John McCain's did in real life this year.</p>
        <p>''West Wing'' producers are betting that viewers are rooting for a campaign finance cleanup. Washington will never want to compete with most goings-on in the show. This one is worth a try.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 20, 2000, Saturday  Because of an editing error, a report in the Campaign Briefing column on Wednesday referred incorrectly in some copies to a scheduled appearance by Senator John McCain with Senator Spencer Abraham, Republican of Michigan. Mr. McCain was never scheduled to appear with Mr. Abraham.</p>
