        <p>THE sauvignon blanc grape is easy to like, harder to love. It is brisk, fun and enjoyable, yet generally it plays a supporting role to wine's superstar grapes -- until the summer, that is.</p>
        <p>Warm weather brings out the best in sauvignon blanc, especially Sancerre, the crisp, refreshing white from the Loire Valley. Sancerre's characteristic tart citrus and herbal flavors sing with a lightness that is perfect for outdoor dining. Imagine the pale, sunny blues and yellows of a summer picnic with an icy bottle sweating in the sun and you have Sancerre, by way of Renoir.</p>
        <p>Sancerre is only one manifestation of sauvignon blanc, but it is perhaps the grape's purest expression, along with Pouilly-Fume, a similar wine produced directly across the Loire from Sancerre. Unlike many California sauvignon blancs, these wines are not augmented with oak, which can add a sweet roundness that can be overwhelming, changing its essential character. Instead, Sancerre is unalloyed sauvignon blanc, bone dry and with a flavor the British say resembles gooseberries and, as they politely put it, ''tomcats.'' That last one is a mild quality in good bottles, though piercing in unbalanced ones.</p>
        <p>The Loire does have some competition. Sauvignon blancs from New Zealand can be excellent, often richer and more forward than the Loire versions, which can be wonderful with salmon but are maybe not as refreshing on a July day.</p>
        <p>At one time, Sancerre was the house white at many Parisian cafes and wine bars, but its popularity skyrocketed in the 1970's, and so did its price. These days, the vogue for Sancerre has waned, and its price, usually $12 to $20 a bottle, seems reasonable, especially compared with California chardonnays. Sancerres are best when young and fresh, so even though the 1996's and 97's that are still in stores are probably fine, I'd stick with the 98's.</p>
        <p>PASCAL JOLIVET, CHATEAU DU NOZAY, 1998: $21  Piquant citrus and grass aromas, tart and fuller-bodied than most.</p>
        <p>. . .  DOMAINE GIRARD, LA GARENNE, 1998: $15  Aromas of herbs and sweet grass, citrus and mineral flavors.</p>
        <p>. . .  DOMAINE VACHERON, 1998: $18  Lemon and apple aromas and flavors, absolutely dry.</p>
        <p>. . .  VINCENT PINARD, CUVEE FLORES, 1998: $16  Apple and mineral aromas, lively flavors, exceptionally long finish.</p>
        <p>. . .  DOMAINE SAUTEREAU, 1998: $15  Lemon and hay aromas, tart citrus, melon and herb flavors.</p>
        <p>. . .  THOMAS LUCIEN &amp; FILS, CLOS DE LA CRELE, 1998: $20  Classic puckery bouquet, grassy, citrus and herbal flavors.</p>
        <p>Listed in order of preference. Prices are those paid in various Manhattan wine shops.</p>
