        <p>Most bat mutilation is done out of sight, under the stands. But Jorge Posada made it only as far as the mouth of the Yankees' dugout before rage possessed him, before he smashed his bat against a wall, once, twice, three times.</p>
        <p>The frustration is mounting for the Yankees. The team that never seems to lose cannot get hits these days, cannot score runs, cannot win. The Yankees lost their fifth straight game last night, by 4-0 to the Chicago White Sox, while managing just three hits against Cal Eldred and two relievers at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>Orlando Hernandez (4-3) pitched well again, allowing two runs in eight innings, but the Yankees have not scored a run for him in consecutive starts. George Steinbrenner, the Yankees' principal owner, attended the game -- his second appearance at Yankee Stadium this season -- but departed without speaking to reporters. The Yankees are 22-14, one game behind the Boston Red Sox in the American League East.</p>
        <p>''The biggest problem we have right now is trying to relieve some of the pressure from all the tension they are accruing just by trying so hard,'' Yankees Manager Joe Torre said.</p>
        <p>The Yankees' offensive funk is not some temporary condition that just came on, like a runny nose. This is a full-blown epidemic of scoreless innings. They have played nearly a quarter of their season and rank next to last in the A.L. in scoring. Eldred, a journeyman who came into the game with a 2-2 record and a 5.36 earned run average, held the Yankees hitless into the middle innings -- the seventh time in 36 games they have been held hitless in the first three innings, the 13th time they have had one hit or fewer in the first three innings.</p>
        <p>The Yankees had a plan of attack against Eldred, taking pitches, trying to work the ball-strike counts in their favor, a classic Yankees strategy. The first 13 batters ignored the first pitch Eldred threw to them.</p>
        <p>But the Yankees could not get a runner past second in the first four innings. Tino Martinez walked to lead off the second and never advanced. Chuck Knoblauch walked in the third -- his first base on balls since April 18 -- and stole second but never advanced. Chicago's Carlos Lee hit a home run off Hernandez in the fifth, whacking a high fastball into the left-field stands.</p>
        <p>Just one run. To a team that cannot get hits, to the Yankees, it must have seemed like 20 runs.</p>
        <p>Torre would say later that his players would come back to the dugout upbeat, speaking positively, just as they always have. Shane Spencer lined a single leading off the fifth for the Yankees' first hit, and the 31,143 fans roared enthusiastically, with anticipation of the rally they have come to expect. And Spencer was quickly erased when Scott Brosius grounded into a double play.</p>
        <p>But Eldred bounced a fastball off the left shoulder of Clay Bellinger, and with Bellinger running on the pitch in the next at-bat, Knoblauch lined a single into center field, Bellinger taking third. Ricky Ledee came to bat, under growing pressure to produce runs, and he coaxed a walk from Eldred, loading the bases for Paul O'Neill.</p>
        <p>There was a growing sense the whole inning, O'Neill would say later, that something good was going to happen, that this would be the inning in which the Yankees would break out. Just one hit, just one at-bat, it makes the whole difference, Posada said.</p>
        <p>Eldred challenged O'Neill with high fastballs, O'Neill fouling off three in a row, back and to the left, just a little late. O'Neill took a ball outside of the strike zone, the count  1-2. Eldred spun a breaking ball, O'Neill swung, the ball climbing away from his bat and toward left field. Fans roared, but as O'Neill ambled toward first base, he knew. It was not enough. He knew Lee would settle under the ball and make the catch in front of the warning track.</p>
        <p>Nearing the bag, O'Neill snapped his helmet off his head with his right hand and bounced it against the ground, the helmet veering in its roll. O'Neill yanked the shin guard off his right leg and flipped it behind him while his body shook and convulsed with shouted anger. ''This game came down to one at-bat,'' he said, ''and I flied out.''</p>
        <p>They are all trying too hard now, pressing, and the intensity of the slump manifested itself the next inning, after Martinez singled. Posada swung at a pitch wildly, in a dramatic uppercut, as if he was desperate to hit a two-run homer, and fouled the ball back. Posada eventually struck out, taking out his frustration on his bat.</p>
        <p>Chris Singleton, a former Yankee, had a hit-and-run single in the ninth to set up a two-run rally against Mariano Rivera, but the extra runs do not make a difference, not when the Yankees are not scoring at all.</p>
        <p>O'Neill slumped in the chair in front of his locker afterward and acknowledged that the Yankees' ability to come back in previous years might give them some perspective in a slump like this. But in previous years -- like in May 1999, the last time the Yankees lost five straight -- the offense has not been so sporadic, the rallies so abbreviated. ''Every year has its own little story,'' O'Neill said, ''and so far this year, the chapters have been short.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Shortstop DEREK JETER continues to undergo treatment for his strained abdominal muscle. He jogged again yesterday, a little harder than he did Sunday, and Manager JOE TORRE is hoping Jeter can return to action this weekend in Cleveland. ''It feels better,'' Jeter said. ''Every day I'm making progress. But I have no idea where it's at. I haven't swung a bat, I haven't thrown.'' . . . The Yankees paid $1.9 million to sign the 20-year-old pitcher CHEIH-MING WANG of Taiwan. Wang will begin at the rookie ball level.</p>
