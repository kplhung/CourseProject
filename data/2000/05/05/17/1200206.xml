        <p>Article speculates on possible trades being contemplated by New York Yankees as result of poor hitting by Ricky Ledee (M)</p>

        <p>Most trade talks ended when the season began as teams preferred to use the first weeks to appraise their players. But that period of evaluation is just about over because in the last week, executives say, some clubs are becoming more earnest in discussing deals as they evaluate their place in the standings and their potential.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are among those teams. If outfielder Ricky Ledee does not start hitting, they will most likely search for a replacement to augment their lineup. The preference of General Manager Brian Cashman, as he stated in front-office meetings in spring training, is to hang onto prospects like Alfonso Soriano and be prepared to make a deal for a pitcher, if one becomes necessary. But Ledee is hitting .211 in 95 at-bats after going 0 for 3 in last night's 4-0 loss to the White Sox at Yankee Stadium. If the Yankees' offense continues to struggle, Cashman could be nudged into making other deals.</p>

        <p>Most trade talks ended when the season began as teams preferred to use the first weeks to appraise their players. But that period of evaluation is just about over because in the last week, executives say, some clubs are becoming more earnest in discussing deals as they evaluate their place in the standings and their potential.</p>
        <p>The Yankees are among those teams. If outfielder Ricky Ledee does not start hitting, they will most likely search for a replacement to augment their lineup. The preference of General Manager Brian Cashman, as he stated in front-office meetings in spring training, is to hang onto prospects like Alfonso Soriano and be prepared to make a deal for a pitcher, if one becomes necessary. But Ledee is hitting .211 in 95 at-bats after going 0 for 3 in last night's 4-0 loss to the White Sox at Yankee Stadium. If the Yankees' offense continues to struggle, Cashman could be nudged into making other deals.</p>
        <p>One of the players the Yankees may consider is Orioles left fielder B. J. Surhoff. Surhoff is among the American League's better hitters, and before last season, he signed a multiyear deal to stay with the Baltimore Orioles. Surhoff has a partial no-trade clause, but after he was shopped around in the off-season, he received assurances from the Orioles that he would not be traded. If Baltimore continues to flounder, however, Surhoff might be asked to accept a deal -- perhaps to one of the New York teams. The left-handed-hitting Surhoff is from Rye, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Surhoff might also be a good fit with the Mets, who tried to sign him before last season; he is currently a left fielder but he can play multiple positions and he would give the Mets the left-handed hitter they need.</p>
        <p>Rival executives who have talked to the Detroit Tigers have been told that right fielder Juan Gonzalez is not available, but it stands to reason that if the right-handed-hitting Gonzalez does not rekindle negotiations on a long-term contract with the Tigers, he might be dealt before the July 31 trade deadline.</p>
        <p>The Yankees spoke with Oakland about Matt Stairs, an outfielder and designated hitter, after Darryl Strawberry was suspended, figuring that like Strawberry, Stairs could give them significant left-handed power in the middle of their lineup. But the Athletics are in contention in the American League West, and it would seem that the only way the two sides could be pushed into a deal is if the Yankees develop enough pitching depth to part with Ramiro Mendoza.</p>
        <p>Another power hitter of note is Tampa Bay's Jose Canseco, a designated hitter these days, who will most likely be available at some point. His long history of injuries makes him a significant risk, and he is a right-handed hitter without the consistency of Gonzalez, making him an imperfect fit for the Yankees.</p>
        <p>The Orioles might also consider trading designated hitter Harold Baines as they did at the end of last year when they dealt him to Cleveland. The fact that Baines is a left-handed hitter might make him attractive to the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Ledee was in the lineup last night, fully aware of the fact that club officials are waiting for him to produce. Manager Joe Torre said last weekend that opportunity resides in the hands of Ledee, and now it is up to Ledee.</p>
        <p>''Regardless of what anyone says, I have to start hitting,'' Ledee said. ''They have given me a great opportunity to play, and I can't ask for more opportunity than to play.''</p>
