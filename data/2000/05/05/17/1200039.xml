        <p>IF you are hauling a lawn mower to the repair shop, a pickup truck or minivan will do. But if you are moving the space shuttle, you need something much more specialized.</p>
        <p>That is where the Crawler comes in. There are only two in the world, both of them at Cape Canaveral in Florida, and they were built to do one job: to move the space shuttle from an assembly building to the launching pad.</p>
        <p>The Crawler falls into a unique niche in the world of motorized vehicles. It is extremely rare; it serves a highly specialized purpose; and few people will ever drive it.</p>
        <p>Other vehicles in the same niche also have unusual names -- Crab and Duck, for example. And the people who drive them say that it can be challenging, sometimes humbling and occasionally exhilarating.</p>
        <p>The Crab</p>
        <p>Think of the Crab as the ultimate dune buggy. Towering 42 feet above the ground, it offers expansive views of sand and sea; it can roll through waves 6 feet high; and can be maneuvered into waters 28 feet deep. But with a top speed of about two miles an hour, driving it is not for thrill-seekers.</p>
        <p>The Crab, or Coastal Research Amphibious Buggy, was built in the 1970's by the Army Corps of Engineers to map the ocean floor. Essentially a giant tripod on wheels, it helps scientists at the Field Research Facility in Duck, N.C., study beach erosion and the effect of storms on the coastline. It is also used to place sensors on the seabed and to take geologic samples.</p>
        <p>Brian Scarborough, 43, a civil engineering technician, has seen major improvements in the Crab since he began driving it 13 years ago -- for example, the addition of an enclosed cab. ''Originally it had a canvas top,'' he said. ''We have computer equipment in there now, so it needs to stay dry.'' He also installed a peppier engine -- a 60-horsepower Volkswagen turbo diesel.</p>
        <p>To make it stable, the Crab's tires are filled with antifreeze. Mr. Scarborough said he had driven it in heavy surf and storms without a problem. It did tip over once, while he was driving near a pier, when one wheel went into a deep hole.</p>
        <p>William A. Birkemeier, the chief of the Field Research Facility, said there were only two similar vehicles in the world, one  near the Great Lakes in Michigan and the other in the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>Mr. Scarborough drives the 9-ton Crab from a platform atop the tripod, at a height of 35 feet, and the mapping is done with the help of a Global Positioning System, which can measure the Crab's location within three centimeters. Mr. Scarborough has a regular steering wheel, but he controls the speed with a lever, which also moves the Crab forward or backward.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Scarborough, a work day can involve six to eight hours of driving along survey lines to help create maps of the seabed. He uses the computer to keep him on track and has a radio in the cab for entertainment, but he concedes the Crab's novelty has long since worn off.</p>
        <p>''Normally, I'll take it out all day,'' he said. ''After you've been up there five or six hours, it's no fun anymore.''</p>
        <p>The Wienermobile</p>
        <p>What is it like to drive a 27-foot-long hot dog? ''It lights your face up with a smile,'' said Chris Grindle, 23, who drove an Oscar Mayer Wienermobile for a year before becoming a sort of den leader for a new batch of drivers.</p>
        <p>''When you drive it down the road, the reaction you get from people is what makes it so much fun -- the smiles, the waves, people stopping to take pictures,'' Mr. Grindle said. ''Tollbooth operators are great. When you go through a tollbooth, it totally makes their day.''</p>
        <p>Oscar Mayer built its first Wienermobile in 1936. It was taken out of service during World War II because of gas rationing. Wienermobiles returned in 1950 and were retired in 1977, making a comeback in 1986 for the company's 50th anniversary.</p>
        <p>The current model was built in 1995 on the chassis of a one-ton Chevy truck. It has a General Motors 180-horsepower engine and a fiberglass body and weighs five tons.</p>
        <p>There are six Wienermobiles on the road, going to state fairs, malls and store openings.</p>
        <p>Next week, Oscar Mayer will add two 2000 models to the fleet. Though the exterior is unchanged, the new Wienermobiles will have antilock brakes, a computerized navigation system and a low-power FM radio transmitter, so that people who pass the Wienermobile on the road can tune in to a 90-second message about the auto. Hot doggers, as the drivers are called, are recruited on college campuses for one-year stints, and they go on the road in teams of three.</p>
        <p>''It's a highly coveted position,'' Mr. Grindle said. ''People use their experience to go into public relations, event marketing, as a springboard to anything you want.''</p>
        <p>Becoming a hot dogger takes two weeks of training that includes driving 12-passenger vans, Mr. Grindle said.</p>
        <p>''It drives exactly like a truck, but you need to get used to it,'' he added. ''You're surrounded by glass.''</p>
        <p>One thing you will not find on the Wienermobile is a rearview mirror; the giant hot dog blocks the view. So drivers must rely on their sideview mirrors and two external cameras that provide a back view.</p>
        <p>The cab has an entertainment system, including a color television, and seating for six, but no sleeping quarters. ''We stay in motels,'' Mr. Grindle said. The back is used as storage for wiener whistles, which the hot doggers give away.</p>
        <p>Mr. Grindle, who is from New Hampshire, has had one other taste of high-visibility marketing. ''I worked as the Kool-Aid man one summer, and I thought I had the coolest job in the world. But then I saw the Wienermobile, and I knew I wanted to do that.''</p>
        <p>The Crawler</p>
        <p>Everything about the Crawler is huge. The size of a baseball diamond, it weighs 3,000 tons; its two diesel engines produce a total of 5,500 horsepower; and it takes a crew of more than a dozen to operate it. It even has its own road, about the width of an eight-lane highway.</p>
        <p>The Crawler has one job: to transport the space shuttle, mounted on a Mobile Launcher Platform -- combined, they weigh 5,500 tons -- from the building where it is assembled in Cape Canaveral to the launching pad. The three-mile trip can take a full day, since the Crawler never goes above 0.95 m.p.h. with the shuttle aboard. Tom Chabrak, 42, drives the Crawler and says it is draining: ''Driving it for one hour seems like driving on the highway for 10 hours.''</p>
        <p>While every run involves several engineers on board and six observers walking alongside, there is only one person at the steering wheel, controlling speed and direction. ''It's kind of intimidating the first time you try it, but after a while it becomes second nature,'' Mr. Chabrak said.</p>
        <p>On a typical run, the Crawler goes underneath the Mobile Launcher Platform and jacks itself from its regular 20-foot height to about 26 feet to pick up the platform.</p>
        <p>The primary challenge in driving the Crawler is to keep it on the road, known as the Crawlerway, which is a sandwich consisting of 8 inches of gravel on top of 4 feet of crushed stone on top of compacted fill.</p>
        <p>''There's only three feet of extra width on either side of the Crawler,'' Mr. Chabrak said, ''and there's only six degrees of steering to the left or right, so if you go too far one way, it takes a while to get back on track.''</p>
        <p>Speed is controlled by a knob that is calibrated to hundredths of a mile an hour.</p>
        <p>Each driver spends only an hour at the wheel, then yields it to another engineer. ''We don't wait till we're at the point of fatigue,'' said Mr. Chabrak, who is the lead engineer in the power systems and transporter section for the United Space Alliance, the prime contractor with NASA for operating the space shuttle.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chabrak, who is originally from Green Brook, N.J., said he enjoyed driving the Crawler, though he admitted, ''It would probably be overwhelming if you thought about how much money is sitting on top and how much is at stake.''</p>
        <p>The Duck</p>
        <p>Richard Clermont, 63, had no idea what he was getting himself into when he answered an advertisement looking for boat captains. ''I had been in the window-decorating business, and I wanted to go into the marine business,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The job interview was virtually a theatrical audition for a job that combines show business with driving. Mr. Clermont, who uses the stage name Captain Courageous, is  a tour guide and driver for Boston Duck Tours, as he pilots a World War II amphibious vehicle through Boston's streets and on the Charles River.</p>
        <p>Ducks are 32 feet long, almost eight feet wide and weigh eight tons. They are powered by 110-horsepower six-cylinder gasoline engines, and each Duck makes five 80-minute tours every day. A Duck's top speed is 55 m.p.h. on land and about 6 m.p.h. in water. ''It handles quite well,'' Mr. Clermont said, ''but it's pretty large to maneuver, especially with the narrow streets.''</p>
        <p>First built by General Motors to transport cargo and men from ship to shore during World War II, the Boston Ducks have been extensively rebuilt and equipped with disc brakes. Boston Duck Tours has 16, and company officials say tours using similar refurbished vehicles are conducted in Branson, Mo., Philadelphia and the Wisconsin Dells, which are north of Madison.</p>
        <p>In Boston, the Duck Tour, which costs $21 for adults, begins on the street, with passengers encouraged to quack at pedestrians. After 20 minutes, Mr. Clermont said, he drives to the Charles River, shifts into neutral and rolls into the water before engaging the propeller for cruising. About 20 minutes later, he rolls back onto the streets.</p>
        <p>Driving an amphibious tour vehicle involves its share of red tape. Each of the company's 33 drivers must have a commercial driver's license, a captain's license from the Coast Guard and a license to conduct sightseeing tours.</p>
