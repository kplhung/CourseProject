        <p>The House tried to put to rest today longstanding Internet rumors of pending e-mail taxes, unanimously endorsing a bill that would prohibit federal fees on Internet access.</p>
        <p>Although sponsors of the bill lauded it as crucial for protecting consumers from potential new costs, opponents said it was unnecessary. The Federal Communications Commission called it superfluous.</p>
        <p>''What we are considering today is a fabricated solution to an imaginary problem,'' said Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan.</p>
        <p>The bill, by two Republican Representatives, Fred Upton of Michigan and Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia, would prohibit the F.C.C. from imposing a per-minute access fee on Internet use, like that imposed on long-distance telephone calls.</p>
        <p>The commission has never proposed such a fee. But it has been the subject of Internet rumors for nearly two years.</p>
        <p>''Not long ago, a rumor began to circulate about bill H.B. 602P, sponsored by a fictitious Congressman Schnell, which would impose an access fee on per-minute Internet use,'' Mr. Goodlatte said in a statement. ''Although there is no such bill and no such Congressman, constituents wrote and called by the thousands expressing their outrage.''</p>
