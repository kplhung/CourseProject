        <p>The news of British troops' success in bringing stability to Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is being greeted here with a mixture of pride in their accomplishment and concern over whether they are becoming too deeply involved in the conflicted West African nation.</p>
        <p>Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon told restive members of Parliament, ''Our armed forces are doing an excellent job, which is acknowledged around the world, but there is no question of the U.K. taking over the U.N. mission or of being drawn into the civil war.''</p>

        <p>The news of British troops' success in bringing stability to Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, is being greeted here with a mixture of pride in their accomplishment and concern over whether they are becoming too deeply involved in the conflicted West African nation.</p>
        <p>Defense Secretary Geoff Hoon told restive members of Parliament, ''Our armed forces are doing an excellent job, which is acknowledged around the world, but there is no question of the U.K. taking over the U.N. mission or of being drawn into the civil war.''</p>
        <p>Britain sent warships and troops to Freetown last week to secure the airport for the purpose of evacuating Britons, other Europeans and some Commonwealth citizens and of enabling the United Nations to fly in reinforcements for its besieged peacekeeping force. The seven Royal Navy vessels off the coast of West Africa make this the biggest expeditionary force mounted by the British since the Falkland Islands war in 1982, and it is causing anxiety here.</p>
        <p>This week, there have been reports that Britons have joined more actively with the United Nations forces, staffing checkpoints and roadblocks around the city. The 700 British paratroopers in Sierra Leone are said to be digging in for a stay far beyond the month they were supposed to spend there. And the reports say decisions are being made to provide arms and supplies to the embattled government of Sierra Leone.</p>
        <p>This has resulted in warnings in Parliament of ''mission creep,'' a gradual undeclared broadening of the British commitment.</p>
        <p>Gen. Sir Charles Guthrie, the chief of defense staff, ended a 24-hour visit to Freetown today with a warning that restoring peace to the former British colony could be a ''long haul.'' He denied the reports of resupplying Sierra Leone forces but noted that Britain had done so in the past and would not rule out doing it again in the present situation.</p>
        <p>In Parliament, Iain Duncan Smith, the Conservative spokesman on defense policy, said: ''Clearer rules of engagement are now needed to allow British forces the flexibility to operate as the circumstances require.</p>
        <p>Gerald Howarth, another Tory member of Parliament, said he feared that the British could get pinned down in the volatile situation and be unable to leave when their stated mission was finished.</p>
        <p>Menzies Campbell, foreign affairs spokesman for the third-party Liberal Democrats, faulted the government for not becoming committed enough to the United Nations peacekeeping effort. ''British forces have put a bit of backbone into the U.N. effort but are not part of it,'' he said. ''Any withdrawal now would have catastrophic consequences for the U.N.'s credibility.''</p>
        <p>Brig. David Richards, the senior British official in Sierra Leone, said today that the United Nations forces had decided to take up a more offensive role, moving into the countryside. Asked in an interview with the BBC if that was a major strategy move on the part of the United Nations, he said, ''I think it is, in terms of a plan, it is definitely a move into the R.U.F. heartland,'' referring to the rebel Revolutionary United Front.</p>
        <p>An official spokesman said Prime Minister Tony Blair briefed President Clinton on Britain's involvement in a 20-minute phone call Monday night. He said the two men had agreed that the solution to the crisis was to shore up the United Nations presence.</p>
