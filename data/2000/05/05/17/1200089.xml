        <p>Al Hirschfeld, the artist whose witty caricatures of stage and screen stars long ago made the leap from newspaper illustration to art displayed by museums, has dismissed his longtime dealer, Margo Feiden, and yesterday took her and Margo Feiden Galleries to court. His suit, filed in state supreme court in Manhattan, accuses Ms. Feiden of cheating him in the buying and selling of his work; of refusing to return drawings that belong to him; of breach of contract; and of otherwise breaching her fiduciary duty.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirschfeld, 96, has been represented by Margo Feiden Galleries since the early 1970's, and the two signed a contract consigning his work to her on Feb. 14, 1974.</p>
        <p>That contract, which Mr. Hirschfeld terminated effective March 1 by letter, gives Ms. Feiden near-total control of his work and allows her gallery to buy his artworks  ''at an unreasonably low price,'' the suit says, resell them for higher prices, and pay Mr. Hirschfeld a low annual minimum that has amounted to $12,000 this year. It also allows her to end their relationship without cause but allows no such escape by Mr. Hirschfeld, the suit says.</p>
        <p>''Mr. Hirschfeld is seeking to regain control of his artwork,'' said David B. Wolf of Cowan, DeBaets, Abrahams &amp; Sheppard, his lawyer. ''He made efforts to negotiate but was turned down.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirschfeld, who declined to comment on the suit, estimated in his affidavit that Ms. Feiden holds 1,000 to 1,200 pieces of his work on consignment. Ms. Feiden, whose gallery is on Madison Avenue near East 62nd Street, represents no other artists. (The gallery's address on the Internet is www.alhirschfeld.com.)</p>
        <p>In a phone interview, Ms. Feiden said, ''There has never been any dispute regarding money between us,'' adding that some of the accusations ''are shocking to me. I tried my very best to keep this out of the public eye because I fear what this will make Mr. Hirschfeld look like in public.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Feiden's lawyer, David Cohen, of  Herzfeld &amp; Rubin, called the accusations ''absolutely false.'' Mr. Cohen said he had not seen the suit but said: ''There's never been one instance of breach of fiduciary duty on her part.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirschfeld, who has supplied drawings to the arts pages of The New York Times for more than 50 years, began selling his art in the 1920's. His drawings now typically command from $10,000 to $12,000 or more and can be found in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the National Portrait Gallery and the Whitney Museum of American Art, among others.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Hirschfeld's affidavit, the troubles that led to the suit began in early 1997, when the Katonah Museum of Art in Westchester County was organizing a retrospective of Mr. Hirschfeld's work. With his approval, the museum hired as guest curator David Leopold, an archivist who once did freelance work for Ms. Feiden and is now employed part time by Mr. Hirschfeld.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirschfeld contends that Ms. Feiden tried to block the exhibition because of ''personal animosity'' toward Mr. Leopold. Ms. Feiden said that she did not oppose the exhibition but only the participation of Mr. Leopold, whom she dismissed in March 1997 ''for lying.'' She said she was also upset because Mr. Leopold had worked on the show from her gallery for several months when she did not even know there was to be an exhibition. ''I have exclusive right to control the exhibition of Mr. Hirschfeld's work,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Leopold denied Ms. Feiden's accusations and said: ''She has also called me a thief, a murderer, and said I'd done everything except kidnap the Lindbergh baby. That's all  100 percent untrue. I have never lied to her; I have never lied to Al. She and I disagree about how things happened.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirschfeld said that Ms. Feiden had threatened to sue the museum if the show proceeded, making ''an unwarranted and gratuitous intrusion into my right to control exhibitions and reproductions of my own artwork.'' Ms. Feiden did not sue, however, and that show went on: It opened in January 1998 and included examples of Mr. Hirschfeld's early work as well as the immediately recognizable theatrical portraits that always incorporate the name of his daughter, Nina, at least once.</p>
        <p>Then last fall, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences told Mr. Hirschfeld that it wanted to mount an exhibition in Hollywood called ''Hirschfeld's Hollywood.'' The academy also engaged Mr. Leopold as curator. The show was supposed to open on April 27 and to travel to other locations. Besides a  catalog, a book called ''Hirschfeld's Hollywood,'' to be published by Alfred A. Knopf, was planned.</p>
        <p>But when Mr. Hirschfeld requested drawings held by Ms. Feiden, he said, she balked. The exhibition, the catalog and the book all collapsed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hirschfeld's suit says that Ms. Feiden thus egregiously violated her responsibilities to Mr. Hirschfeld by ''refusing to follow Hirschfeld's instructions on the disposition of his artwork, refusing to provide Hirschfeld with his artwork when he has requested that she do so, and seeking to prevent exhibitions of his artwork solely for her own personal reasons.'' It also contends that Ms. Feiden refused to provide Mr. Hirschfeld with records and documentation about the works he consigned to her.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wolf refused to disclose details about the ''self-dealing'' mentioned in the suit beyond what is in Mr. Hirschfeld's affidavit, which states: ''I understand that she has bought a number of my pieces of artwork for her own account at unreasonably low prices and has then either sold them to third parties at much higher prices or is holding them for future sale.''</p>
        <p>Passages of the suit bristle with hostility. One section relates that Ms. Feiden told Mr. Hirschfeld that ''he would spend the rest of his life in court if he tried to recover his artwork'' and that ''she did not work for him, he worked for her.'' Another accuses Ms. Feiden of ''an intentional, reckless and malicious campaign of harassment and intimidation, transcending all bounds of decency'' against Mr. Hirschfeld.</p>
        <p>The suit asks the court to issue an injunction against sales by Ms. Feiden and to order her to return his work and to account for sales since January 1997. It seeks damages in excess of $5 million as well as punitive damages.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 19, 2000, Friday  An article on Wednesday about a lawsuit by the artist Al Hirschfeld against his dealer, Margo Feiden Galleries, referred imprecisely to its payments to him. The contract stipulated that the gallery owner, Ms. Feiden, must pay Mr. Hirschfeld an annual minimum of $12,000 if the contract was to be renewed. Her payments this year have been more than that sum, not equal to it.</p>
        <p>Correction:  January 22, 2003, Wednesday  An obituary of the caricaturist Al Hirschfeld yesterday referred imprecisely in some copies to a lawsuit he filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan in 2000 against his longtime dealer, Margo Feiden, and dropped later that year, before negotiating a new agreement with her. (A similar reference appeared in an article about the suit on May 17, 2000.) The suit sought more control for Mr. Hirschfeld over the sale and exhibition of his drawings and asked for more rigorous accounting of the sales; it did not accuse Ms. Feiden of cheating him in the buying and selling of his work.</p>
