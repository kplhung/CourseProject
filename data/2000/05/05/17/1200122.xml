        <p>A week after BMW A.G. agreed to pay a British group more than $750 million to take over its money-losing Rover subsidiary, angry investors accused the German automaker's top management today of amateurism, arrogance, bad judgment and deceptive statements.</p>
        <p>And for the first time, BMW's chief executive apologized for making statements ''that might be interpreted differently.''</p>
        <p>But what mattered most at BMW's annual shareholder meeting here was a brief written statement from the company's dominant stockholders, the Quandt family, who own roughly 47 percent of the shares. In a blunt rebuttal to would-be acquirers of BMW -- past rumors have ranged from the Ford Motor Company to Volkswagen -- the Quandts said they had ''not the slightest interest in selling'' and were ''100 percent committed to BMW.''</p>
        <p>Today was largely a day for venting from small shareholders, who have watched in dismay as BMW lost $6 billion on Rover in the last six years. Under German corporate laws, any shareholder at an annual meeting may face board members directly and say almost anything.</p>
        <p>On May 9, after the collapse of an earlier agreement with a British venture capital group, Alchemy Partners, BMW announced it would sell Rover for the token amount of $:10, or about $15, to the Phoenix Consortium, a group with trade union and government support led by a former Rover executive, John Towers. Under the deal, BMW will lend Phoenix more than $750 million.</p>
        <p>Today, more than 3,000 people showed up for BMW's meeting, some of whom had to wait in line for an hour or so just to get in. Many were chafing for the opportunity to assail BMW's chief executive, Joachim Milberg, as well as members of the Quandt family.</p>
        <p>''Billions have been wasted since 1994,'' said Rudolf Eisemann, a small-business man from Heidelberg who has been a shareholder for decades. ''Rover was scrap at the time; the plant was scrap, waiting for the bulldozers to come.''</p>
        <p>In an attack often greeted with loud applause and laughter, Mr. Eisemann berated Mr. Milberg for nearly 10 minutes. ''You said you cannot drive a car by looking in the rear-view mirror,'' he remarked. ''But what did you do? You drove the car right into a wall.''</p>
        <p>Addressing Stefan Quandt, son of the late Herbert Quandt, BMW's patriarch, and a member of BMW's supervisory board, Mr. Eisemann said: ''Mr. Quandt, your father, I am sure, is crying bitterly in his grave.''</p>
        <p>Daniela Bergholdt, a lawyer representing a shareholder advocacy group, accused the management of engineering a disaster and then pursuing what she called a ''dilettantish and highly unprofessional'' attempt to literally give Rover away.</p>
        <p>''BMW has been damaged by arrogance and ignorance,'' Ms. Bergholdt said. ''The entry of a premium automobile supplier into the volume market has failed miserably. The adventure with Rover could not have ended any worse than it did.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Milberg, who took over as chief executive in February 1999 after problems with Rover led to the ouster of Bernd Pischetsrieder, conceded that BMW managers deserved a large part of the blame.</p>
        <p>He acknowledged that he had been misleading when he insisted, as recently as February, that BMW was still committed to Rover and its line of middle-priced sedans. In reality, the company was looking to sell Rover or shut most of it down.</p>
        <p>''I answered all questions on the future of Rover to the best of my knowledge,'' Mr. Milberg said today. ''I am, however, aware that in hindsight some of the statements made might be interpreted differently. This, I sincerely regret.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Milberg said it would have been disastrous to disclose his interest in selling Rover, not having reached any kind of deal. ''In such a situation,'' he said, ''you have no other choice. You have to opt for the lesser of two evils.''</p>
        <p>Few people had much doubt that Rover was in grave trouble. BMW had counted on the British carmaker to produce middle-priced family cars that would supplement its own lines of sporty luxury cars without diluting the BMW brand name.</p>
        <p>But Rover's new models failed to arouse much buyer interest, and the company was battered by the effects of exchange rates: the British pound soared in relation to the euro, the German mark and other European national currencies, which made British-built cars prohibitively expensive compared with those from the Continent.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milberg acknowledged today that BMW had made a number of mistakes, but he laid the blame for most of these at the door of his predecessor. Mr. Milberg said BMW failed to absorb the fact that Rover had not developed any new cars of its own in years, that it overestimated the ''emotional ties'' of British buyers to the Rover brand, and that it  overestimated the competence of Rover's management.</p>
        <p>He acknowledged that he had now reversed the strategy he long used to justify the reliance on Rover.</p>
        <p>For several years, he and other executives argued that BMW would cheapen its image as a luxury car company if it started producing medium-priced cars under its own name. But when BMW announced plans to sell Rover to Alchemy Partners -- the deal that collapsed several weeks later -- BMW said it would now develop its own new line after all.</p>
        <p>Today, Mr. Milberg said that a lower-price part of the market was ''ripe'' for a genuine BMW.</p>
        <p>German newspapers and magazines have carried speculation that Mr. Milberg might soon be ousted from his post -- something BMW has denied.</p>
