        <p>When she was a securities broker in Florida for the NationsBank Corporation in the early 1990's, Catherine Hovis knew that the elderly clients she was selling mutual funds to did not have the financial or emotional means to take on risky investments. One couple, both in their 70's, were living on Social Security and wanted something as safe as a certificate of deposit but with a better return -- maybe 7 to 8 percent.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hovis convinced the couple that the bank's mutual funds were safe and, at her bosses' urging, reassured them they had made a smart investment even after the value of the funds declined.</p>
        <p>Today, Ms. Hovis, 43, acknowledges that she had begun to suspect the mutual funds were not as solid as bank management had led her to believe. Yet, she continued to sell them to risk-averse elderly clients because, she says, she was doing what her bosses told her to do. She was also motivated by her supervisor's praise, a six-figure salary, financial bonuses and a free trip to the Cayman Islands, becoming one of the top 25 sellers of the funds for NationsBank, now part of Bank of America.</p>
        <p>''Money makes people do very strange things,'' Ms. Hovis said. ''As a single mother, I was willing to do what I had to do.'' Besides, she added: ''I'm human. I wanted to be a team player.''</p>
        <p>The practice of pressuring the elderly to buy mutual funds, which Ms. Hovis said was pervasive throughout the bank, led to a $29 million class-action settlement by NationsBank in 1997 with people who had been sold the funds. Despite the settlement, the bank vigorously denied the assertions in the suit. Last week, bank officials declined to comment on Ms. Hovis's assertions.</p>
        <p>As she describes it, her moral plight was unusually stark. But the basic choice she faced between her paycheck and her principles is one that most workers eventually encounter. And with hordes of people now fixated on stock market riches and million-dollar game shows, ethicists warn that ordinary Americans are having an even harder time holding on to their moral bearings.</p>
        <p>The transgressions that tempt them can be as seemingly trivial as fudging an expense report and as troubling as lying to law enforcement officials to protect their boss. Sometimes, they make headlines, as happened this year when Christopher M. Davidge, a former chief executive of the Christie's auction house, was said to have told government investigators that Sir Anthony Tennant, a former chairman, had ordered him to carry out a price-fixing scheme.</p>
        <p>''Most people just go along with what other people do and respond to the expectations of those around them,'' said David Vogel, an ethics professor at the Haas School of Business at the University of California at Berkeley. ''This encourages and permits ethically dubious behavior.''</p>
        <p>Paradoxically, the tight labor market -- which logically ought to diminish worries about job security -- might actually encourage ethical lapses, some experts say. ''In a rising economy, you don't want to be left out,'' said William Lundin, author of ''When Smart People Work for Dumb Bosses'' (McGraw-Hill, 1998). ''To be at the big table and play with the big guys, you take chances and risks, and bend your ethics.''</p>
        <p>Many companies have adopted codes of conduct and other ethics programs in recent years. Yet, a new survey by the consulting and accounting firm KPMG shows that unethical behavior is still rife in the workplace. The survey of 2,300 workers in a broad range of industries was conducted in 1999 and released last week. More than three-quarters of the respondents had witnessed illegal activities or breaches of company rules over the previous 12 months, and 38 percent said they believed that senior managers would ''authorize illegal or unethical conduct to meet business goals.'' Factors that they said encouraged unethical behavior included the pressure to meet unrealistic production and earnings goals.</p>
        <p>''We're still seeing fairly significant levels of misconduct,'' said Richard Girgenti, KPMG's national director of investigative and integrity management services. ''Ethics programs need attention and nurturing.''</p>
        <p>Crossing certain ethical boundaries may be endemic to certain industries. In a recent survey by the trade journal PR Week of 1,700 public-relations executives, 25 percent acknowledged lying on the job, 39 percent said they had exaggerated the truth, and 44 percent said they had ethical qualms about tasks they had been asked to perform.</p>
        <p>A common catalyst for wrongful behavior is common to every industry: blind devotion to a boss. Nan DeMars, an ethics consultant in Minneapolis, cited an Atlanta secretary who, trusting her boss, notarized a document for the sale of his wife's car without witnessing the wife's signature -- a breach of the law -- because he insisted it was hers. It wasn't, the wife said in a lawsuit, and the secretary ended up with a felony conviction.</p>
        <p>Richard O. Mason, head of the Maguire Center for Ethics and Public Responsibility at Southern Methodist University in Dallas, said that people guilty of ethical missteps usually have a ''moment of truth'' in which they either decide to rationalize their behavior or try to make amends.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hovis is trying to make amends. ''I paid for the blood money,'' she said, fighting tears. ''All the calls and cries for help'' from clients gave her sleepless nights, she said, and led to occasional heavy drinking.</p>
        <p>She decided in 1994 she did not want to sell the funds anymore and soon left the bank. Since then, she said, she has cooperated with federal and state regulators, including testifying to the Securities and Exchange Commission. On top of the $29 million class-action settlement, in 1998 NationsBank agreed to pay $6.75 million to settle charges by the S.E.C. and other regulators that it had misled investors about their investment risks. NationsBank neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>''It's the least I can do to repay my part of what I did,'' said Ms. Hovis, who is now trying to make a career out of teaching financial education. ''When I'm dead and gone, at least my son will say, 'My mom tried.' ''</p>
