        <p>After two days of legal maneuvering, jury selection in the tax fraud trial of Albert J. Pirro Jr., the prominent Westchester lawyer, ended today, clearing the way for opening arguments to begin on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>A jury of eight men and four women were chosen to hear the case against Mr. Pirro, 52, and his brother, Anthony G. Pirro, 45, whom the government has charged with illegally deducting $1 million in personal spending as business expenditures. The two brothers have blamed each other for the accounting discrepancies but say that their situation does not constitute criminal misconduct.</p>
        <p>The trial is expected to last five weeks. It has been eagerly anticipated, because Albert Pirro, a prominent Republican lobbyist and fundraiser, is the husband of Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney. Ms. Pirro has not been charged with any wrongdoing.</p>
        <p>Jury selection -- which usually lasts less than a day in criminal trials -- was less than swift in this case.</p>
        <p>On Monday, prosecutors and defense lawyers argued over whether jurors should hear about a paternity case involving Albert Pirro. The judge, Barrington D. Parker Jr., agreed to ask potential jurors about their attitudes on paternity issues.</p>
        <p>Sidebar conferences between the judge and the lawyers on whether to excuse potential jurors dominated today's proceedings. By day's end, the lawyers had eliminated most of the original pool of about 70 prospective jurors.</p>
        <p>For the most part, potential jurors were quiet. One certainly seemed to be a quick study: he said he was not troubled by the paternity suit, but then quickly added, ''But I have another issue. Can I have a sidebar?''</p>
        <p>That juror made the final cut.</p>
