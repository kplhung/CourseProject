        <p>At first glance, the Violence Against Women Act appeared an unlikely battleground for the Supreme Court's continuing federalism wars.</p>
        <p>This 1994 federal law neither told the states to do anything nor prohibited them from taking any action. By permitting private damage suits by victims of ''gender-motivated violence'' against their attackers, the law did not expose the states themselves to any new legal liability.</p>
        <p>This was no titanic struggle among co-equal sovereigns: when the legislation was pending in Congress, the attorneys general from 38 states urged its passage, and 36 states joined a brief supporting the law before the Supreme Court. Only one, Alabama, filed a brief asking the justices to strike the law down.</p>
        <p>Despite all that, the court invalidated a central provision of the law on Monday by a 5-to-4 vote. Developments at the court over the last five years made the law a nearly perfect target for the narrow but determined majority of justices who, through half a dozen earlier rulings, brought the court to the point at which the invalidation of the Violence Against Women Act, as an unconstitutional exercise in Congressional overreaching, was close to inevitable.</p>
        <p>There are distinct strands to the court's new federalism jurisprudence, and in a formal sense, the decision in United States v. Morrison, Monday's ruling, represents only one of them: holding Congress to its limited and enumerated powers. In this sense, the ruling flowed directly from a 1995 decision that struck down, as beyond Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce, a law that made it a federal crime to carry a gun near a school. That decision, United States v. Lopez, was the first time since the New Deal that the court found Congress to have exceeded its authority under the commerce clause. States' rights, as such, were not directly at issue either in the Lopez case or in the decision on Monday.</p>
        <p>But in a broader sense, the latest decision represents something more: a convergence between the court's focus on a Congress of limited powers and its newly found solicitude for state sovereignty, the focus of other recent federalism decisions that have carved out new immunities for the states from federal court lawsuits or federal policy ''commandeering.'' The convergence lay not so much in anything Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist's majority opinion said explicitly, but in the background music of a decision that rejected a large volume of evidence that the law's sponsors had compiled to show why a national approach to violence against women was needed.</p>
        <p>''The court applied its own meta-test'' to the legislative record, said Prof. Laurence H. Tribe of Harvard Law School: ''We don't care what the findings are, if accepting them endangers our vision of state sovereignty, our view of the architecture of our system.'' That test applies, Professor Tribe said in an interview, ''even when the states are basically willing bystanders.''</p>
        <p>Further, the decision moved the federalism counterrevolution closer than any of the other recent cases toward the core issues of civil rights for which the court for so long had given Congress wide scope. By ruling that the Violence Against Women Act was not an appropriate exercise of Congress's power to enforce the equal protection guarantee of the 14th Amendment, the court emphasized that in the area of civil rights, no less than interstate commerce, Congressional assertions of power were now to be scrutinized under a judicial microscope.</p>
        <p>''It's the intersection of the New Deal and civil rights, coming together in a case concerning women,'' Prof. Judith Resnik of Yale Law School said in an interview. She said the court's rejection of the argument that violence against women was an appropriate subject for national legislation was a reminder of earlier eras, when the Supreme Court viewed labor-management issues and, even earlier, slavery, as a matter of interpersonal relations, not properly subject to federal intervention.</p>
        <p>In the years leading up to its final passage, the Violence Against Women Act was a frequent target of criticism from federal judges, including Chief Justice Rehnquist, who singled it out in a 1998 speech as one of ''the more notable examples'' of laws that unduly expanded the jurisdiction of the federal courts. ''Our system will look more and more like the French government, where even the most minor details are ordained by the national government in Paris,'' the chief justice warned in a speech to the American Law Institute.</p>
        <p>The familiar federal civil rights laws that bar discrimination in employment and in public accommodations are not in any danger from the decision, which cast no doubt on the court's assumption in prior cases that jobs, hotels, restaurants and the like are part of the national economy that Congress can properly regulate under its commerce power.</p>
        <p>But when states themselves are defendants, there are strong signals that the court is looking through a different lens. Already, the court has declared states immune from suit by their employees for federal labor law violations and for age discrimination. In its next term, the justices will decide whether states can be sued under the Americans With Disabilities Act.</p>
        <p>Beyond those particular implications, the broader fallout from the decision this week could lie outside the courtroom. Beginning with the Lopez decision, which invalidated a law few people had ever heard of, most of the court's federalism rulings have involved obscure statutes or obscure constitutional provisions like the 10th and 11th Amendments. As a result, a constitutional development of potentially enormous significance has been unfolding -- albeit in plain sight -- largely outside the realm of public discussion.</p>
        <p>That could change, given the higher public profile of the Violence Against Women Act, the considerable attention the decision has received, and the closeness of the vote. Not too many years ago, it would hardly have seemed likely that questions about federalism might dominate a Supreme Court confirmation hearing. Now that prospect seems likely when the next vacancy occurs.</p>
        <p>In another respect, the fallout from the decision could be surprising. Prof. Glenn H. Reynolds of the University of Tennessee Law School noted in an interview today that to regard the decision as a victory for conservatives could well be short-sighted. As recent Congressional debates on flag burning, school prayer, abortion methods and other such issues indicate, he said, much of what Congress does these days is symbolic, and much of the symbolism is conservative. But under the logic of this week's decision, Professor Reynolds added, any action in these areas would almost certainly exceed Congress's authority. ''The beauty of our system is that everything bites back eventually,'' he said.</p>
