        <p>THE baseball commissioner did away with the league offices last winter, so no one was left in the American League office to write a new script for this season. Evidence of the oversight is abundant in this season's developments.</p>
        <p>Pedro Martinez was the American League pitcher of the month for April last season; he was the A.L. pitcher of the month for April this season. Mo Vaughn was the player of the week for the second week of May last season; he was the player of the week for the second week of May this season. The Boston Red Sox slipped ahead of the Yankees into first place in the A.L. East in mid-May last season; they slipped ahead of the Yankees into first place in the A.L. East in mid-May this season.</p>
        <p>So how boring is this going to be? If they're going to rerun the entire season, we might as well go to the beach for the summer and come back in time for the postseason games. At least by then maybe the people in the commissioner's office who stuffed little rabbits into all of those balls will have lifted their heads out of the briar patch and realized they need a new script.</p>
        <p>The funny thing is, many of the Yankees don't even realize they're playing a rerun of last season. They would probably watch reruns of late-night television test patterns.</p>
        <p>Does Paul O'Neill remember when the Yankees were in second place last May? ''No, I really don't,'' he said yesterday.</p>
        <p>How about Tino Martinez? ''Not really,'' he said. ''I don't remember that. When you win the World Series, you forget even how the season began.''</p>
        <p>It's not so funny for the Red Sox. They think they actually have a chance to replace the Yankees as division champions. They don't know it's the same script.</p>
        <p>The Red Sox, who bumped the Yankees from first place Sunday, supplanted the Yankees in first place last season on May 18 and remained there for the next three weeks. Their biggest lead over the Yankees during that period was two and a half games, achieved when they defeated the Yankees in the first game of a three-game series May 25 at Yankee Stadium. The Yankees won the next two.</p>
        <p>Guess what? The Red Sox and the Yankees play a three-game series at Yankee Stadium May 26, 27 and 28. Where have you gone, Gene Budig? Baseball fans turn their bored minds to you and ask for a rewrite, not a rerun. Maybe if they let her, Phyllis Merhige could do it. The senior vice president in an office that has been obliterated, she is the highest-ranking A.L. executive left, although one would be hard pressed to find her name in a listing of baseball officials.</p>
        <p>Barring a rewrite, however, we can expect the Yankees to let the Red Sox have their fun for a few weeks, then reclaim their rightful position and cruise from there to October. To hear the Yankees talk, it's all nonsense now anyhow. ''This time of year it's meaningless,'' O'Neill said, speaking of the standings.</p>
        <p>''I don't think any of us pay attention to what the other teams are doing,'' Scott Brosius said. ''Until it gets into September, it doesn't really matter too much.''</p>
        <p>Right on, Tino Martinez said. ''We start playing better baseball,'' the first baseman said, ''we'll move up in the standings and be where we should be.''</p>
        <p>Until late last week, the Yankees had the league's best record. But now, after last night's 4-0 loss to the Chicago White Sox, they have lost five games in a row, two by shutouts and three during an embarrassing series at Detroit, the team with the league's worst record. ''There are certain times of the year when you don't play as well,'' O'Neill said. ''Right now we haven't played well.''</p>
        <p>He wasn't talking only of the losing streak. The Yankees had somehow achieved the league's best record while not hitting especially well and sometimes not even pitching well early in some games. ''If you look at the season so far,'' O'Neill said, ''and talk about Boston being in first place and us being in second place, they're playing their best baseball. They've won what? Five, six, eight in a row, whatever they've won, and we're playing the worst we've played all year. They're one game up on us. That's the way I look at it.''</p>
        <p>The Toronto Blue Jays ended Boston's winning streak at six last night by rallying for three ninth-inning runs and a 7-6 victory. But the Red Sox held their one-game lead over the Yankees. They have been playing without Nomar Garciaparra, Carl Everett and John Valentin, so they have been playing their best without their best.</p>
        <p>The Yanks believe their best is yet to come. It says so in their S O S -- Same Old Script.</p>
