        <p>Was it kismet that Olivier Baussan was given his first name, which means olive tree in French? Mr. Baussan, a native of Provence, is a walking encyclopedia of olive oils. His new shop, Oliviers &amp; Company, near Track 17 in Grand Central Terminal, sells 25 extra virgin cold-pressed olive oils from France, Spain, Italy, Israel and Greece, each labeled with the harvest date and the type of olive used, and each in a simple, utilitarian container: $18 to $36 for a 16.8-ounce tin, $13 to $24 for an 8.4-ounce bottle.</p>
        <p>As a young man, Mr. Baussan, now 47, sold herbal infusions and olive oils in farmers' markets. He started L'Occitane, a company that specializes in fragrance and body care products, but sold it in 1992 to concentrate on his chain of 20 olive oil stores. This is his first in America; another is to open this summer on Columbus Avenue near 69th Street.</p>

        <p>As a young man, Mr. Baussan, now 47, sold herbal infusions and olive oils in farmers' markets. He started L'Occitane, a company that specializes in fragrance and body care products, but sold it in 1992 to concentrate on his chain of 20 olive oil stores. This is his first in America; another is to open this summer on Columbus Avenue near 69th Street.</p>
        <p>A display of olive oils that looks like a chandelier, right, dominates the decor of the tiny shop, which also sells vinegars in small flasks, olive oil soap, olive pastes, salad bowls and all sorts of pottery, metal and glass bottles and flasks for oil. Three bottles in a smart metal holder Mr. Baussan designed are $52 empty, $78 filled with the oils of your choice. The shop also sells his book, ''Olive Oil: A Gourmet Guide'' (Flammarion, $35), a handsome and excellent resource with recipes by Jacques Chibois, the chef at La Bastide St.-Antoine in Grasse, France.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baussan said he hopes to offer oils from North Africa in the future. But not from California. ''The soul of my enterprise is Mediterranean,'' he said. ''I'm not doing the olive oils of the world.''</p>
