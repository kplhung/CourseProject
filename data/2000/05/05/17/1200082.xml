        <p>The poets were Irish. The composers spanned the world from the British Isles to the Continent and the United States.

        <p>NEWS  Isle of Inspiration</p>
        <p>The poets were Irish. The composers spanned the world from the British Isles to the Continent and the United States. They meet once more at 8 p.m. tomorrow in Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall, where the New York Festival of Song will close its 12th season with ''Songs of the Irish Poets.'' This affectionate tribute to Ireland's literary and lyric traditions features works by composers as diverse as Beethoven and Berlioz, Britten and Arnold Bax, and lyrics by Yeats and Joyce, among many others. The singers will be Amy Burton and Theodore Green; the pianists, Michael Barrett and Steven Blier; and the violinist, Paul Woodiel.</p>
        <p>Ars Gratia Artis</p>
        <p>Its title is ''Drawn to Death: A Three Panel Opera.'' Its narrator is Mr. Crime, the ghoulish figure who introduced the stories in the once-notorious comic book ''Crime Does Not Pay.'' Besides the comic's co-founder and managing editor, Charles Biro, its characters include  Jack Cole, creator of the polymorphic ''Plastic Man,'' and Dr. Fredric Wertham, the criminal psychiatrist who crusaded against comic books in the 1950's. Their lives are intertwined by the Pulitzer Prize-winning cartoonist Art Spiegelman in ''Drawn to Death,'' his first live theater work. With music by Phillip Johnston and framed screens where the libretto (in speech balloons) and drawings are projected, this work in progress about the rise and fall of comics will be presented for two performances, at 8 p.m. tomorrow and Friday, by Arts at St. Ann's, 157 Montague Street, Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>Honors</p>
        <p>At Buckingham Palace yesterday, the British-born actresses Elizabeth Taylor and Julie Andrews starred in a glittering investiture ceremony in which Queen Elizabeth II made each a dame of the Order of the British Empire -- the equivalent of a knighthood. . . . At ceremonies today at the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the artist Red Grooms, the architect Steven Holl and the writer James Salter will be inducted as members. The filmmaker Martin Scorsese and the avant-garde theater director Robert Wilson will become American honorary members.</p>
        <p>Asian Treasures</p>
        <p>In February, when the Indianapolis Museum of Art acquired a major collection of Japanese paintings of the Edo period (1615-1868), it joined the handful of American museums with outstanding collections in that field. Beginning on Saturday, the complete collection of 75 hanging scrolls and folding screens will be displayed through Aug. 6 in ''300 Years of Japanese Painting: New Treasures for Indianapolis.''</p>
