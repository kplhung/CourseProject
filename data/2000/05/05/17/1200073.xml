        <p>Low-Fat Cream Sauces</p>
        <p>Q. I am always looking for ways to make low-fat, low-cholesterol versions of recipes, and I'm having a problem with cream sauces. In place of cream, I've been substituting evaporated skim milk. Although the taste is fine, the sauces seem to separate or curdle. What am I doing wrong?</p>
        <p>A. You are probably overheating your sauces. Bringing the sauce to a simmer, which is commonly called for in recipes using heavy cream, won't work with lower-fat dairy products like milk or yogurt. This is because heat encourages the proteins in all dairy products to clump together and curdle. Heavy cream has enough fat to coat the proteins, keeping them separate and flowing in a smooth, creamy liquid, but skim milk does not. Therefore, only recipes using heavy cream can safely be brought to a simmer.</p>

        <p>Low-Fat Cream Sauces</p>
        <p>Q. I am always looking for ways to make low-fat, low-cholesterol versions of recipes, and I'm having a problem with cream sauces. In place of cream, I've been substituting evaporated skim milk. Although the taste is fine, the sauces seem to separate or curdle. What am I doing wrong?</p>
        <p>A. You are probably overheating your sauces. Bringing the sauce to a simmer, which is commonly called for in recipes using heavy cream, won't work with lower-fat dairy products like milk or yogurt. This is because heat encourages the proteins in all dairy products to clump together and curdle. Heavy cream has enough fat to coat the proteins, keeping them separate and flowing in a smooth, creamy liquid, but skim milk does not. Therefore, only recipes using heavy cream can safely be brought to a simmer.</p>
        <p>That said, there is a simple way to substitute low-fat milk for cream: add starch. Starch will both thicken the sauce and keep it from curdling. A good rule of thumb is to blend two to four teaspoons of cornstarch, arrowroot powder or potato starch to one cup evaporated skim milk (or regular skim milk), then add it to the saucepan. Bring the sauce to a simmer, and cook for a minute or two, until it thickens.</p>
        <p>If you want to salvage a sauce that has already curdled, try whirling it  in the blender to recombine it. This will work with most sauces, as long as you serve it quickly before it  separates again.</p>
        <p>Bowls That Don't Interact</p>
        <p>Q. When a recipe tells you to mix something in a nonreactive bowl, what does that mean?</p>
        <p>A. A nonreactive bowl is made from glass, ceramics, plastic or stainless steel, which are inert materials. A reactive bowl is one made from unlined copper or unlined aluminum. Cast-iron cookware is also reactive.</p>
        <p>Reactive materials can interact with the liquid in a recipe, especially acidic ones like tomato juice, lemon  juice or buttermilk, which can negatively affect the flavor and color of the mixture. Most bowls sold today are nonreactive.</p>
        <p>There is one instance in which a cook may prefer a reactive bowl. When egg whites are beaten in an unlined copper bowl, the eggs' proteins bond with acids in the copper, creating a stronger, more stable egg-white foam than can be achieved in a nonreactive bowl. (A similar reaction can be produced in any bowl, however, by adding a pinch of cream of tartar to whites as you beat them.)</p>
        <p>Edible Carrot Tops</p>
        <p>Q: The stems and leaves of carrots look appetizing. Are they edible?</p>
        <p>A: Carrot tops are edible, and they can actually be quite tasty. Belonging to the same family as parsley, they have a similar herbaceous flavor, though the texture is much chewier.</p>
        <p>Look for very young, fresh carrots with feathery bright green tops. These will have the best flavor. In early summer, local farmers' markets often carry them, as do specialty produce markets.</p>
        <p>Give the tops a rinse, and then experiment with adding them raw to salads, or mincing them and using like an herb. You can also try cooking them in stir-fries, soups and stews, adding them as you would spinach or other greens.</p>
        <p>Once separated from the roots, carrot tops can be kept in a plastic bag in the refrigerator for about two days before they start to wilt. It's worthwhile to seek out organic carrots, since pesticides can end up in both the root and leaves.</p>
        <p>Essence of Mushroom</p>
        <p>Q: How long do dried mushrooms last? I bought dried porcini mushrooms in Italy in 1994. The package is still sealed. Are they still good to use?</p>
        <p>A: Dried mushrooms can last for years if they are kept in a well-sealed container and protected from light, heat and dampness. But you should inspect them before using, looking for signs of rot or mold. Sniff them for any decaying odor; they should smell woodsy rather than ripe.</p>
        <p>If they pass those tests, they'll be fine to use. But keep in mind that dried mushrooms can lose flavor. Before using them, taste the mushroom soaking liquid (most recipes recommend soaking dried mushrooms in water or other liquid). If the liquid seems weak, you may want to add more mushrooms or other seasoning.</p>
