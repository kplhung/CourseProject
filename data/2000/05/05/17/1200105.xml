        <p>Free Eyeglasses for Students</p>
        <p>Childsight, a division of Helen Keller International, began a program this week to provide free eyeglasses to as many as 30,000 middle-school students in New York City over the next three years.</p>
        <p>Childsight, a nonprofit organization, says  many children cannot read simply because they cannot see the words. And many children cannot afford to buy glasses to correct their vision, the group said.</p>
        <p>Aided by ophthalmologists and volunteers, the organization's workers screened 560 students in  sixth to eighth grade Monday at Intermediate School 183 in the Mott Haven section of the Bronx. There was a big cart full of lenses and frames, and 137 children got their glasses the same day.</p>
        <p>Childsight's program is financed with an $850,000 grant from the Reader's Digest Fund for the Blind and is run by Columbia University's School of Public Health.</p>
        <p>''In adolescence, children's bodies go through a change, and their eyes go through a change as well,'' said MEREDITH TILP, vice president of  Childsight. ''Their world is totally out of focus, and yet we're asking them to perform well on standardized tests.''</p>
        <p>C. W. Post Gets $10 Million Gift</p>
        <p>GARY WINNICK is the chief executive of the telephone and undersea cable company Global Crossing Ltd. and identified by Forbes magazine as America's ''fastest-rising billionaire.'' When he visited his alma mater, the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University, last weekend, not only did he speak at the commencement ceremony for 7,500 graduates, but he also promised the institution $10 million, its largest donation ever.</p>
        <p>Mr. Winnick, 52, who grew up in Roslyn, N.Y.,  said in an interview that his years at Post opened up ''such possibilities'' that he wanted to give others similar opportunities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Winnick's gift will go toward the financing of scholarships in the School of Performing Arts and the College of Management as well as the restoration of a Tudor-style mansion at the center of Post's campus, which is in Brookville, N.Y, and is one of six campuses of Long Island University.</p>
        <p>Mr. Winnick, incidentally, missed his own graduation ceremony because he was drafted into the Army.</p>
        <p>State Receives Royalty Share</p>
        <p>Ten years ago, Cornell University agreed to give New York State a share of any royalties and licensing fees generated from research conducted in two research centers built with nearly $43 million in state aid.</p>
        <p>Today, HUNTER R. RAWLINGS III, Cornell's president, will present a $452,786.91 royalty check to CAROLE E. STONE, acting New York state budget director, and RUSSELL W. BESSETTE, executive director of the New York State Office of Science, Technology and Academic Research. Cornell officials say they believe it is the first time that the state has received royalties from a university whose research it helped to finance.</p>
        <p>Search for Hunter Chief</p>
        <p>Trying to dramatize the significance of the search for a new president at Hunter College, HERMAN BADILLO, the chairman of the City University of New York, has chosen BENNO C. SCHMIDT Jr., CUNY's vice chairman, to lead the effort. Usually the chairman and vice chairman do not head a particular presidential search since they try to play roles in all of them.</p>
        <p>''Since he's the former president of Yale, I thought this would let people all over the country know that we are looking for a higher-caliber person,'' Mr. Badillo said. Together with City College and Queens, Hunter, which has about 20,000 students, is one of CUNY's most selective colleges that are in the market for new presidents.</p>

        <p>Correction:  May 18, 2000, Thursday  A brief report on the Education page yesterday about the distribution of eyeglasses to low-income schoolchildren misidentified the organization running the program on behalf of Childsight, a nonprofit group. It is Helen Keller International; the Columbia School of Public Health operates the program in Washington Heights only.</p>
