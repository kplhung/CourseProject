        <p>IT is common to feel foolish at the tire store. What should you ask for? Should you stay with the kind of tire that came with the car, or try something different, maybe sportier? Is it O.K. to go for low-cost tires, or do you sacrifice safety and handling? Can buying top-of-the-line tires turn your station wagon into a roadster?</p>
        <p>Though many replacement tires are sold -- 184 million passenger car tires and 30.5 million light-truck tires in the United States in 1998 alone -- tires are an enigma to most people. Throw in a raft of technological innovations (even tires will have computer sensors soon) and coding systems that seem to combine algebra and Urdu, and it is clear why the humble tire is so mysterious.</p>
        <p>Here is a starting point: the tire chosen for a new American passenger car is carefully engineered to do a good job at sometimes conflicting tasks.</p>
        <p>* It must last 40,000 miles. That is what buyers expect.</p>
        <p>* It must have low rolling resistance to save gas and help the car company meet its fuel-efficiency mandates.</p>
        <p>* It must offer a comfy, quiet and slightly road-deadening ride. (Most Americans do not like to ''feel'' the road.)</p>
        <p>* It must provide decent traction in all weather conditions on a variety of surfaces.</p>
        <p>Those are the criteria the builders set when they mate a car with its first set of tires, and for most driving the choices remain good. The car's suspension is tuned to the weight, size and rolling resistance of those tires.</p>
        <p>''The tire is a product of -- I'll say compromise,'' said Donald L. Botka, a vice president at Continental General Tire in Charlotte, N.C. The company takes at least two years to design and fine-tune its products, working with a manufacturer.</p>
        <p>What makes a tire appealing to automotive engineers may not be what a performance-oriented driver wants. Or it may not even appeal to a driver who does not live in a part of the country where weather changes significantly by season.</p>
        <p>While premium tires may not necessarily make your staid sedan stand up and howl, different tires do change the ride. Up to 20 percent of a car's noise, vibration and ride harshness can be attributed directly to tires, engineers say. If your sedan's tires tend to squeal during turns, a stiffer sidewall may cure the condition. Some drivers may want more road grip, better mud-and-snow traction or a longer life span for tires.</p>
        <p>''The replacement market is a different animal,'' said Robert Carroll, the vice president of original equipment marketing for Michelin. ''What you're looking at is trying to service a customer to meet his consumer needs.''</p>
        <p>Getting a grip can mean sacrifices, Mr. Carroll and other tire experts point out. Speed-oriented tires may compromise fuel efficiency, tread life and all-season traction in favor of dry-pavement performance. To gain the latter, such tires often have more rigid sidewalls than their cushier brethren, meaning a harsher ride.</p>
        <p>''Comfort is what Americans crave,'' Mr. Carroll said. But he also noted that Americans are very image-conscious. A fast driver may try to buy his way up the performance-tire chain but find himself sorely disappointed by what he gets. ''The normal American, who is buying that tire for image, perhaps, would find that car so nervous when he's driving down the highway that he couldn't even have a cup of coffee because he has to have both hands on the wheel,'' Mr. Carroll said.</p>
        <p>For the driving enthusiast who wants total road feel and catlike traction, the cost of high-end performance tires, like the $145-a-tire Goodyear Eagle F1, makes sense. Such a buyer may own a multiseason set of tires, and a winter set, perhaps Firestone's $80 FT 70 C cold-weather tire, with its special rubber compound, mounted on separate wheels.</p>
        <p>At the opposite end of the spectrum, customers who are looking for extremely long-lived tires -- those that guarantee 80,000 or even 100,000 miles of tread wear instead of 40,000 miles, or those that can run for miles even after the air has leaked from them -- may not realize they could be trading away  handling and gas-mileage advantages by paying a premium for peace of mind.</p>
        <p>Michelin's X-1 tire shows one trend in long tire life: for $120 a tire, the company guarantees six years of driving with no mileage limit.</p>
        <p>Some tires may complicate driving in the name of safety. Take the case of what manufacturers call extended-mobility tires, commonly called run-flats. Such tires have been appearing recently in luxury cars; Chevrolet's Corvette comes with them. Extended-mobility tires are designed so that for 50 miles or so, the sidewalls can hold the weight of the car even after air leaks out.</p>
        <p>''I don't think the problem has been with them working,'' said Lloyd Stoyer, the editor of Modern Tire Dealer, a trade magazine. ''The problem has been with cost, the cost of the sensors needed to tell you when the tire is flat.</p>
        <p>''These tires are not as fuel efficient,'' Mr. Stoyer continued. ''They don't handle as well. On the off chance that you have a flat, you drive on a tire that is not as efficient.''</p>
        <p>Some manufacturers are hailing breakthroughs in new, lightweight materials as a sign that run-flat tires are improving and will become the norm. Tire dealers are not jumping on the bandwagon just yet. Equipment to install and service $2,000-to-$3,000 run-flat tire systems is costly, and there are not enough of these tires on the road to make them standard items at any dealership.</p>
        <p>''Run-flat requires special everything,'' said Darin Ode, the general manager of Ode Tire and Service in Warren, Mich. ''When you get the flat, you know what's happened, but you don't know how far it's going to be before you can find a distributor who can replace your tire.''</p>
        <p>At the opposite end of the price spectrum, four-tires-for-$100 campaigns have appealed to thriftier buyers.</p>
        <p>IS low price sufficient reason to buy a particular tire?</p>
        <p>''Why are people willing to spend more for a pair of sneakers than for tires when their life depends on the tires' performance for thousands of miles?'' a tire engineer asked at a recent online automotive forum.</p>
        <p>His point is well taken; it is all too easy to get wrapped up in price without thinking about what the tires cost over their life span. But if buying tires at rock-bottom prices is a big issue, be sure to check the Uniform Tire Quality Grade traction and temperature ratings molded into sidewalls. (Every tire company assigns an ''A,'' ''B'' or ''C'' grade to its products, with ''A'' being the highest.)</p>
        <p>Tires can be inexpensive because the cost of their materials has fallen markedly over the last five years, new automated assembly methods have been introduced, which have cut labor costs, and fierce competition between retailers has slashed margins to the bone. Tire technology has matured to the point that competition is based more on price than on manufacturing advances.</p>
        <p>But the industry thinks it is on the cusp of a new era in technology. More functions may soon be packed into tires beyond traction and handling abilities. Continental Teves Inc. introduced its ''intelligent tire''  last fall with test-track demonstrations for the Frankfurt Auto Show in Germany.</p>
        <p>The tire uses magnetic stripes molded into the sidewall to send traction information to sensors mounted near each wheel.</p>
        <p>''When you drive a car, when you accelerate, brake or turn, basically what's allowing you to do that is friction or forces between the tire and the road,'' said Philip Headley, the chief engineer of advance technology at Continental Teves's North American headquarters in Auburn Hills, Mich. ''What the 'intelligent' tire does is actually allow us to measure those forces.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Headley said that the tire's feedback could tell the onboard car computer whether a tire was skidding or slipping, or about to skid. The tire could replace more expensive sensors in electronic stability systems that help drivers avoid accidents.</p>
        <p>At Michelin, the Pax tire system changes the entire wheel, clamping a tire onto a precision wheel, which includes a rubber insert ring. The ring and the rim provide more than 100 miles of run-flat ability. Michelin is seeking to license the technology and make it an industry standard. Pax has recently appeared on ''concept'' cars, like the Cadillac Evoq, designed and built but not  ready for mass production.</p>
        <p>Such complex tire-wheel systems may run at much higher inflation pressures than current tires do -- more than 50 pounds a square inch, rather than the 32 to 35 pounds common today -- to increase fuel efficiency. They could also include pressure-  and temperature-sensing technology to give drivers early warning of changing tire conditions, prompting drivers to maintain tires and  thereby extend tire life.</p>
        <p>Eventually, tires may also change shape,  morphing from a wide, cushy ''boulevard'' ride at 35 miles per hour to a tough, thin freeway mileage-maker at 65 m.p.h.</p>
        <p>That is an automotive generation away, though. For drivers who must replace their radials today, Mr. Stoyer suggests being prepared to answer three questions at the tire store: ''How long are you going to keep the car? What kind of driving do you do? And what do you expect of a tire? If they listen to the answer to those, any type of tire dealer ought to be able to give you a tire you're going to be happy with.''</p>
