        <p>The morning after Palestinian rioting disintegrated into fierce gunfire, many Israeli and even some Palestinian political analysts were surprised to find themselves crediting Prime Minister Ehud Barak with defusing a potential political, diplomatic and military crisis.</p>
        <p>By this morning, the gun battles between Israeli and Palestinian troops had ended and the violence was tamped, although low-level clashes continued in the West Bank. Back-channel peace negotiations in Stockholm continued, and the American peace envoy, Dennis Ross, met separately here with Mr. Barak and Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader. And Mr. Barak's government, which had seemed on the verge of collapse, was still intact, though not quite harmonious.</p>
        <p>Not long ago, that same gunfire would have led to harsh retributions and sustained tension. Now, the absence even of a sense of crisis seemed to speak to a new self-confidence on both sides, and to the shared belief of Mr. Barak and Mr. Arafat that they have too much to lose if they allow themselves to be dragged into another cycle of violence.</p>
        <p>Some Palestinians commended Mr. Barak for demonstrating a commitment to the peace effort that, until now, they were not sure he had. In the midst of gun battles on the periphery of Jerusalem and despite a shaky coalition, Mr. Barak managed to secure Parliament's approval for turning over three villages to the Palestinian Authority. Instead of using the violence as an excuse to flee his obligations, he persevered, and that was unexpected, they said.</p>
        <p>''This was a very important litmus test, and people felt relieved,'' said Munther Dajani, director of the Palestinian Center for Regional Studies in the West Bank. ''At this juncture in the peace process, it gave people hope, because Barak delivered when the chips were down.''</p>
        <p>In neighboring Jordan, the state-owned Jordan Times was similarly pleased, saying, ''It is not often that we take our hats off to Israeli officials, but Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is to be respected for his decision to put his political career on the line for the sake of a much higher cause, that of peace.''</p>
        <p>Emotions still ran strong in the West Bank, where three families buried the Palestinian men killed in the clashes with Israeli troops on Monday.</p>
        <p>And many Palestinians and Israelis were quick to stress that they considered Mr. Barak's near crises to be the self-inflicted wounds of an inexperienced politician. Critics said he had failed to appreciate the intensity of the Palestinians' frustration with slow-moving peace talks, and their anxiety that his domestic troubles were turning him into an unreliable peace partner.</p>
        <p>''Barak creates his own monsters,'' said Hanan Ashrawi, a Palestinian legislator. ''He shoots himself in the foot and then points to it and says, 'See how difficult life is.' ''</p>
        <p>And until he finally acted on Monday, the prime minister had allowed  Israeli rightists to convert the three dusty towns into a charged political symbol, while his most troublesome coalition partner, the Shas party, made its support into a bargaining chip to get shekels for its school system.</p>
        <p>In their commentaries today, Israeli political analysts paid little attention to Mr. Barak's handling of the violence in the West Bank. Instead, several praised him for finally taking charge and catching his political opponents off guard in a parliamentary ''blitzkrieg.''</p>
        <p>After months of indecision, he dared balky parties to make good on their threats to quit his government and won decisive backing for his peace initiative. Only one small party, the National Religious Party, said it would defect to the opposition.</p>
        <p>Now, when Mr. Barak goes to Washington this weekend to meet with leaders of American Jewish groups, he will go ''as a man,'' one of his advisers said.</p>
        <p>''Yesterday, only yesterday, did Barak begin his real term as prime minister,'' Nahum Barnea, a longtime political analyst, wrote on the front page of the newspaper Yediot Ahronot this morning, almost a year to the day after Mr. Barak was elected by an overwhelming majority with a mandate to make peace.</p>
        <p>Already on Monday afternoon, when Israeli legislators focused almost exclusively on their political game despite the violence raging in the West Bank and Gaza, it was evident that a new diplomatic environment had changed the political one to allow for a kind of self-absorption among many Israelis.</p>
        <p>There was a curious disconnect between events in Jerusalem and those just miles away in Ramallah, where street violence deteriorated into a rare gun battle between Israeli and Palestinian forces. But it was a telling one.</p>
        <p>It suggested an instinctive faith on the part of Israeli politicians that the situation would not flare out of control and that, through dialogue between Israeli and Palestinian leaders, it would be contained. Which it was.</p>
        <p>''It will all be O.K.,'' Nawaf Masalha, Israel's deputy foreign minister, said calmly in his office in Parliament shortly before armed Palestinian men advanced on the Israeli-guarded Joseph's Tomb in Nablus on Monday night, where they were met by Israeli gunfire, Israeli helicopters and Israeli tanks. ''There is a direct phone line between Barak and Arafat. They will make it fine.''</p>
        <p>Speaking in Ashkelon today, Mr. Barak said: ''I do not want us to delude ourselves on the way to peace agreements. There will be further difficulties. But we are strong, determined to reach our destination, and we will reach it.''</p>
        <p>Underlying this calm was the fact that no Israelis were killed, even though three Palestinians died of gunshot wounds on Monday and one on Sunday, and hundreds of Palestinians were wounded. If today had brought Israeli instead of Palestinian funerals, the calculus in Israel probably would have been different.</p>
        <p>Only Hatzofe, a small daily newspaper of the National Religious Party, sounded alarm bells today. ''War in Judea and Samaria,'' its headline said, using the Biblical place names for the West Bank.</p>
        <p>The accepted wisdom among Israelis and Palestinians was that Mr. Arafat allowed, or even initiated, the street protests. He did so partly because his people needed an escape valve for mounting frustration with their lot in general, with the Palestinian Authority itself and with what they perceive as Israeli intransigence in the peace negotiations.</p>
        <p>There already had been a week of protests over Palestinian prisoners in Israel before the outbreak of intense violence on Monday, the anniversary of the ''nakba,'' or ''catastrophe,'' as Palestinians call the creation of the state of Israel. The protests over the prisoners, organized by Mr. Arafat's Fatah political organization, channeled other unrest into an anti-Israeli demonstration.</p>
        <p>Temporarily, Mr. Arafat gained a measure of domestic peace: Teachers earning $300 to $350 a month suspended a bitter wage strike, and West Bank college students halted protests about the alleged political misuse of university funds.</p>
        <p>And the protests could have proven diplomatically useful, allowing Mr. Arafat to dangle the specter of a popular uprising before Israeli eyes to underscore the need for progress on the peace front.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Arafat, all agree, lost control of the situation. Maj. Gen. Moshe Yaalon, the chief of Israel's Central Command, said today that the Palestinian leader had intended to keep the disturbances ''at a low flame but could not control the intensity of the fire.''</p>
        <p>One factor limiting Mr. Arafat's control was the ambivalence of his own security officers. At times, they prevented Palestinians from confronting Israeli troops. At other times, they joined the protesters and turned their weapons on the Israelis.</p>
        <p>The repressive and sometimes lawless behavior of the Palestinian police has earned them widespread enmity in the Palestinian territories. Yet many police officers are themselves proud veterans of past street battles and, Mr. Dajani said, cannot countenance the impression ''that they are now siding with the Israelis against their own people.''</p>
        <p>''The attitude towards the police went from very negative to very positive yesterday,'' he said. ''There was a sense of camaraderie, that everyone was on the same side for once.''</p>
