        <p>Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, today sharply criticized a bill backed by Senate Republicans that would set a deadline for withdrawing American ground troops from Kosovo. Mr. Bush called the bill a ''legislative overreach'' that would tie his hands if he becomes president.</p>
        <p>But the Senate majority leader, Trent Lott of Mississippi, along with the bill's chief Republican sponsor, John W. Warner of Virginia, said they would push ahead with the measure. That sets up the first major foreign policy clash between Mr. Bush and congressional Republicans.</p>
        <p>Until today, momentum seemed to be building among most Senate Republicans for the measure, which would cut off funds for the 5,900 United States forces in Kosovo by July 1, 2001, forcing their withdrawal, unless Congress authorizes an extension. Many Republicans said they assumed that Mr. Bush endorsed the measure, which may be voted on as early as Wednesday.</p>
        <p>But last weekend, opponents of the measure, including at least five Republican senators, warned Mr. Bush's top aides of the potential conflict. In response, the Bush campaign issued its statement.</p>
        <p>''The Clinton-Gore administration has failed to instill trust in Congress and the American people when it comes to our military and deployment of troops overseas, but the governor does not believe this provision is the way to resolve the lack of presidential leadership,'' Scott McClellan, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, said. ''Governor Bush views it as a legislative overreach on powers of the presidency.''</p>
        <p>Top aides to President Clinton have recommended that he veto an $8.6 billion military construction bill if the Senate language is attached.  The bill includes $4.7 billion for American military operations in Kosovo, anti-drug efforts in Colombia and other defense spending.</p>
        <p>Defense Secretary William S. Cohen warned today that passage of the measure would send a dangerous signal. ''If the United States were to mandate an artificial deadline for our departure, then I suspect that other members of NATO will do the same,'' he said. And that would lead to ''the return to the kind of conflict we witnessed last year.''</p>
        <p>After Mr. Bush's views were made known today, splits quickly formed in the party line, and Republicans were casting about tonight to figure a graceful way out of the showdown.</p>
        <p>''I agree with the governor,'' said Senator Thad Cochran, a Mississippi Republican. ''He would need the flexibility of a newly elected president to make decisions with his own advisers.''</p>
        <p>Senator Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska Republican, said, ''We're putting that new president in a very difficult position, with no flexibility and no latitude on a very, very complicated issue in the Balkans.''</p>
        <p>Such opposition would likely kill the proposal, said Senator Ted Stevens, an Alaska Republican who heads the Appropriations Committee, and who supports the measure.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Lott said he still supported the measure. Mr. Warner agreed, but said the floor vote would be close.</p>
        <p>''Presidents are very protective of their prerogative, but what I'd say to him is that Congress has its own prerogative and it's the power of the purse,'' Mr. Warner said in an interview. Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican, said she would recommend pushing back the deadline to give the next president more time to work with the Congress.</p>
