        <p>Coca-Cola's largest bottler said yesterday that it would not meet its growth target in the United States this year and that it was facing even bigger hurdles in another major market, Britain.</p>
        <p>The fortunes of the Coca-Cola Company are closely linked with those of the bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises, and investors fled both stocks yesterday. Shares of Coca-Cola Enterprises tumbled 30 percent, or $6.9375, to $15.625, a 52-week low. Shares of Coca-Cola fell $3, to $48.9375.</p>
        <p>Whether sluggish growth at the bottler will drag down Coca-Cola's goals is a significant concern to investors. Just last month, Coke's chairman and chief executive told analysts that growth in sales volume would slow to 5 percent to 6 percent worldwide this year before returning to 7 percent to 8 percent next year.</p>
        <p>''The system can only be healthy and growing if the bottlers are healthy and growing,'' said Andrew J. Conway, an analyst for Morgan Stanley, who downgraded Coca-Cola Enterprises yesterday.</p>
        <p>The bottler's president and chief operating officer, John R. Alm, said in a conference call with analysts early in the day that domestic volume would grow only 1 percent to 2 percent this year, instead of 2 percent to 3 percent.</p>
        <p>In Britain, the bottling company's difficulties will lead to a shortfall in operating profit for the year, officials said late Monday after the stock market closed in New York. Cheaper Coke products are being shipped into Britain from European Union countries outside the bottler's territory. The flood of imports is being encouraged by the weak euro, which makes the foreign-made products cheaper. The bottler said its earnings for the year would be 50 cents a share, instead of the 71 cents previously projected, because of currency fluctuations and one-time charges related to layoffs.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Alm's lower targets for the United States perplexed Wall Street analysts the most. ''With the bulk of the summer selling season ahead, between Memorial Day and July Fourth, I don't know why he would pull the plug on their growth rates,'' said Martin Romm, of CS First Boston.</p>
        <p>Sales of Coke products have slowed in many parts of the United States in the last year as prices have risen in supermarkets. The higher prices were planned by Coke and its bottlers after years of unprofitable promotions, like a two-liter bottle for less than $1. Industry experts expect the price increases to benefit the industry in the long term. But since the higher prices took hold, many consumers have turned to other drinks, including store-brand colas. Private-label soft drinks now have about 12 percent of the total soft drink market, nearly the same level as their peak in 1994.</p>
        <p>As to the problems in Britain, analysts said Coke products from elsewhere had been showing up there for years. ''We are surprised with the severity of the problem in the U.K. because foreign product in the marketplace is not a new issue,'' said Jennifer Solomon of Salomon Smith Barney. ''We've been saying that their profit growth objectives were too aggressive, and now they've confirmed that. We've also been saying that their volume growth objectives were too aggressive, and they've confirmed that as well.''</p>
        <p>In the conference call, Mr. Alm said a two-liter bottle of Coke cost about 50 percent more in England than in other parts of Europe. It is unclear whether Coke and its bottlers can do anything to halt the flow of products from European Union countries, because the practice is accepted and supported by European law. ''Where inappropriately sourced products from outside the E.U. are entering Great Britain, we will address it with the appropriate authorities,'' Mr. Alm said.</p>
        <p>To bolster sales in England, the bottler plans several joint programs with Coca-Cola and will forgo planned price increases, Mr. Alm said. Sales to retailers, taverns and bars have all been affected, because the bottler normally works through wholesalers to reach these outlets. Pat Mannelly, the bottler's chief financial officer, said about 25 percent of Coke's wholesale business in Britain was being displaced by products brought in from elsewhere.</p>
        <p>Coca-Cola Enterprises also plans to lay off 300 people in London and use the estimated $20 million in savings for sales efforts.</p>
        <p>Coca-Cola is coming off one of its worst years on record. To strengthen domestic sales, it has planned a summer promotion called the Discover Can, which conceals prize awards inside a false top. Mr. Alm called the promotion the strongest in several years and said it might help sales grow faster than 1 percent to 2 percent during the summer.</p>
        <p>Coca-Cola's stock received some support from the disclosure that Prince Walid bin Talal of Saudi Arabia had bought $50 million of the stock as part of a $1 billion investment in what he called undervalued United States companies, including the Coke rival PepsiCo.</p>
        <p>Separately, Coke said it would spend $1 billion over five years on programs for minorities and women and $1 billion over three years on bottling plants and other efforts to build the business in Africa.</p>
