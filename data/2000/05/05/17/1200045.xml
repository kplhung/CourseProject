        <p>THE wave of consolidation that has swept over the auto industry has been accompanied by much verbiage about the need to achieve economies of scale. The message is clear. Competition among automakers has never been tougher, so they must work together to share costs.</p>
        <p>In the process, they are creating more global products. This makes economic sense, of course, but there is a problem: a car is not a Coke.</p>
        <p>The Ford F-Series pickup truck may be the best seller in the United States, but its size and fuel consumption dictate that it will never find much favor among European buyers, who live in medieval cities with narrow streets and have to cope with startlingly high gasoline prices. In Japan, the best-selling model is a Suzuki minicar that could almost be popped into the cargo hold of a Lincoln Navigator.</p>
        <p>Not that global cars do not already exist; they do, and have for years. Henry Ford's Model T, which did so much to bring mobility to the United States in the 1920's, was manufactured around the globe. Volkswagen's original Type 1 -- the Beetle -- was conceived in the mid-1930's with a similar mobility goal for Germany. When it went into production after World War II, the Beetle became a best seller worldwide.</p>
        <p>Today, specialized market producers like Porsche and Ferrari sell the same models around the world. So do some prestige automakers like BMW, Mercedes-Benz and Jaguar, although in many instances their suspensions and specifications are adjusted to suit local tastes.</p>
        <p>And in cars, those tastes can be quite pronounced. For example, Europeans favor passenger cars with diesel engines, which have never made much of a dent in the United States market. They now account for a quarter of all new-car sales in Europe and appear to be headed higher. The popularity is a reflection of the diesel engine's economy  and the generally lower prices for diesel fuel.</p>
        <p>Europeans also like hatchbacks, while Americans prefer sedans. That can be seen in last year's sales figures for the Volkswagen Golf hatchback and its sedan equivalent, known in Europe as the Bora and in the United States as the Jetta. In Europe, the Golf is the most popular model, outselling the Jetta 6 to 1. In the United States, the Jetta four-door sedan is nearly seven times as popular as the Golf hatchback.</p>
        <p>Automatic transmissions, the norm in the United States, are comparatively rare in the most popular models in Europe, where manual shifting still seems to be regarded as a symbol of virility.</p>
        <p>Big-volume automakers know, then, that choosing a car is a complex exercise influenced by regional culture and national pride, and by more fundamental local issues like road space, tariff and trade barriers, taxes, currency exchange rates and household income.</p>
        <p>It is difficult to categorize all national markets, but they fall into three broad types: those like, say, Finland, which are completely open; those that favor local production by placing heavy taxes on imports (South Korea, for example); and those that  are the exclusive preserve of local producers, like China.</p>
        <p>Although firm sales figures are not yet available, a random tour of the globe shows  how these influences and realities affected consumer buying patterns last year.</p>
        <p>China</p>
        <p>In a country like China, where consumer credit is tight, buying a big-ticket item like a car is not done lightly. Volkswagen -- Germany's ''people's car'' -- is now China's people's car. The old Volkswagen Santana model, a sedan version of the 1980's Passat hatchback, was the most popular car there last year, followed by the Santana 2000, a long-wheelbase version of the same car. Both are made in conjunction with a local producer, the Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation. The Daihatsu Charade hatchback, VW Jetta sedan and Citroen ZX hatchback are other popular models, each made in collaboration with a local partner.</p>
        <p>Michael J. Dunne, the president of Automotive Resources Asia Inc., which has offices in Beijing and Bangkok, said the Chinese bought about 571,000 new passenger cars last year, and a total of 1.83 million vehicles of all types.</p>
        <p>VW dominates the car market, with 55 percent, for several reasons: it got an early start in China, in 1985; it offers good value for money; and it has strong local partners. But it is facing new competition. ''VW's leadership will be challenged by new entrants like Toyota with its Vitz model, Honda with the Accord and G.M. with its Buick Century and Opel Corsa,'' Mr. Dunne said.</p>
        <p>India</p>
        <p>Like Volkswagen in China, the Suzuki Motor Corporation has a tight grip on the closed Indian market because it pioneered local production in the early 1980's in association with Maruti Udyog Ltd. Today, as any traveler to India can observe, Maruti sells two-thirds of all cars, with Suzuki-based economy models known as the 800, Zen and Omni occupying the top three sales slots.</p>
        <p>But that may change in time. Ford, General Motors and Hyundai of South Korea have focused on India for expansion. So has Telco, an Indian company that is part of the large Tata Group, which is developing a car line. There are already indications of the challenge Maruti is facing in India: the Hyundai Santro and Tata Indica were fourth and fifth best sellers last year.</p>
        <p>Russia</p>
        <p>Russia is much more open these days than in the old Soviet days, but local products still dominate the market. The devaluation of the ruble in August 1998 instantly made imports a great deal more expensive without affecting the prices of Russian-made cars; Western and Asian importers, which had been making good progress, suddenly found their cars priced out of the market.</p>
        <p>So Russian manufacturers sold 955,000 new cars last year, and importers only 79,000, some of them locally assembled. On the other hand, secondhand cars imported into Russia accounted for an estimated 400,000 registrations, said Dmitri O. Choulga, a General Motors spokesman in Moscow.</p>
        <p>Russia's most popular model last year was the Riva, a boxy, rear-wheel-drive sedan based on the old Fiat 124 and made by AvtoVAZ, the country's largest automaker. Nearly 282,000 were sold. The same company's Samara, a front-wheel-drive hatchback, was the runner-up with 201,000, followed by the Volga 3110 sedan made by AvtoGAZ.</p>
        <p>Far East</p>
        <p>As in Russia, importers do precious little business in South Korea. Three local brands dominate the market there. The Hyundai Sonata/Marcia midsize sedan was comfortably the best seller last year, with 122,600. It was followed by the Daewoo Matiz, a minicar; the Daewoo Nubira midsize sedan; and the Kia Carnival minivan.</p>
        <p>For American and European manufacturers, South Korean trade is something of a sore point. In theory, the South Korean market is open to foreign cars, but in fact only 2,400 imports were sold there last year. By contrast, South Korean producers sold 1.1 million cars and light trucks locally and exported 1.5 million more.</p>
        <p>''The forces of protectionism are alive and well in Korea's domestic market,'' says a joint statement issued by the Automotive Trade Policy Council in Washington and the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association in Brussels.</p>
        <p>The issue has taken the pressure off Japan, which used to be the favorite ''unfair trade'' target for American and European automakers. In fact, car imports accounted for 6.5 percent of the Japanese market last year, and Volkswagen and Mercedes-Benz, the two leading importers, sold nearly 50,000 cars each.</p>
        <p>The real automotive sales successes in Japan, though, are those of the Japanese producers. But the best sellers are not the cars, like the Toyota Camrys and Honda Accords, that Americans immediately associate with Japan. The best seller last year was the tiny Suzuki Wagon R, which looks like a narrow, boxy cross between a minivan and a station wagon, followed by the Daihatsu Move and Honda Life.</p>
        <p>They all belong to a peculiarly Japanese segment known as minicars, which have engines with displacements of no more than 660 cubic centimeters and are about 134 inches long by 58 inches wide. By comparison, a Ford Taurus four-door sedan, one of the most popular cars in the United States, has a three-liter V-6, and a body that measures 197.6 inches by 73 inches. An estimated 60 percent of the minicars, which miraculously seat four or five, are bought by women in their 20's.</p>
        <p>Outside the minicar segment, the Toyota Corolla was Japan's most popular car last year, followed by the small Toyota Vitz (a hatchback version of the Echo) and the large Toyota Crown sedan.</p>
        <p>The influence of Japan's automakers is evident right across the rest of the Far East. Thailand is a good example. It wants to become the major automotive force in Southeast Asia, and since 1995, it has attracted $1.5 billion worth of new factories from G.M., Ford, Honda and Toyota.</p>
        <p>The country's best sellers, however, are all locally made Japanese models. And what Thai buyers prefer -- even more than American buyers -- are pickup trucks. They accounted for 56 percent of Thailand's total sales of 218,000 vehicles last year, with models from Isuzu, Toyota and Mitsubishi leading the list.</p>
        <p>Even in Malaysia, which is trying to forge an indigenous automotive industry through daunting tariffs on imports, all the most popular models are based on Japanese designs. The best seller last year was the Proton Wira, a locally made Mitsubishi Colt, followed by the Perodua Kancil, a version of the Daihatsu Mira. Other Protons and Peroduas accounted for the next most popular sellers.</p>
        <p>Singapore, with no domestic manufacturers to protect, takes a totally neutral view of all imports -- and then turns them into some of the most expensive cars on earth through quotas and taxes. At the same time, Singapore has invested heavily in public transportation, which is cheap and efficient, while it levies tolls for driving downtown at certain times. The result is a remarkably congestion- and pollution-free atmosphere.</p>
        <p>Singapore's best seller in 1999 was the Nissan Sunny, which achieved a market share of 18 percent on sales of a mere 6,600. Other top sellers were the Toyota Corolla, Mitsubishi Colt/Lancer and Honda Civic.</p>
        <p>Other Points</p>
        <p>South Africans, too, prefer Japanese-based products, all of which are assembled locally. The Toyota Hilux pickup was the best seller last year, with the Toyota Conquest sedan second. There was a more even spread in popularity in Israel last year. Various Mazdas led the Volkswagens and Hyundais.</p>
        <p>European and United States automakers hold more sway in South America. The best seller in Brazil, the continent's biggest national market with just over one million sales last year, was the VW Golf, with nearly 231,800, followed by the Fiat Palio, Chevrolet Corsa, Fiat Uno and Chevrolet Astra. In Turkey, the Renault R12, Megane and R19 outsold models from other local assemblers.</p>
        <p>Europe</p>
        <p>Predictably perhaps, sales across Europe were dominated by European producers and by G.M. and Ford, whose long presence in the region effectively makes them local producers. Over all, VW's Golf was the leader in Western Europe, with more than 707,000 sold. General Motors' Opel/Vauxhall Astra was not far behind, followed by the Renault Megane/Scenic, Ford Focus and Renault Clio.</p>
        <p>With strong local industries in several countries, there were obvious national differences in buying patterns. The Golf and Astra were comfortably top sellers in Germany last year, and the Megane/Scenic and Clio were well ahead in France. Assorted Fiats held sway in Italy. British buyers favored  Fords above all else, a reflection of the company's nearly 90 years as a local producer.</p>
        <p>Similarly, in Eastern Europe, the companies that invested in local production are now reaping the rewards. In Poland, for instance, the country's best sellers last year were the Fiat Seicento and Daewoo Matiz, both economy models made in Poland. A few weeks ago, G.M. also began making its European economy model, the Agila, in a new Polish factory. That is bound to influence local buying patterns in the future.</p>
        <p>But for less partisan views of European preferences, it is instructive to turn to the sales returns from a couple of countries with no tradition of vehicle manufacturing. In Finland, the two most popular models were G.M.'s Opel Astra and Ford's Focus. Toyotas and Volkswagens also sold well.</p>
        <p>And in Greece, the top model was again  the Astra, followed by the Hyundai Accent, Citroen Saxo and Toyota Corolla -- a truly international group.</p>
