        <p>Consumers will quickly begin to feel the pinch of the Federal Reserve's half-point rate increase as borrowing -- from home equity loans to car and truck financing to credit cards -- becomes more expensive. Rates on fixed-rate mortgages, however, have already climbed and may even retreat some from their current level of about 8.5 percent, specialists said.</p>
        <p>And consumers with money to invest will most likely benefit from the Fed's action yesterday, though the rates that banks pay on investments like certificates of deposit and money market accounts tend to rise less fully or with a lag, depending on various factors, including the amounts involved.</p>
        <p>''People aren't going to wake up tomorrow and find their rates a half-point higher,'' said James E. Glassman, a managing director at Chase Securities, said yesterday. ''But it's progressively growing more expensive'' to borrow for millions of consumers whose aggregate personal savings rate, as a proportion of disposable income, has dwindled to virtually nothing, he said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, while few real estate deals already in progress are likely to be jeopardized, some consumers in New York and elsewhere who are stretching to buy houses before prices go up further may find prospective lenders increasingly shy about committing to very large loans. An increasing number of buyers lock in financing before shopping for a home.</p>
        <p>Michael LaCarrubba of Jersey City, who plans to buy an apartment in Lower Manhattan, expressed the uncertainty of many consumers after learning of the Fed action. ''It's kind of scary right now; it's a race against time to get a rate locked in before they rise too much,'' he said. ''It is unnerving because you don't know what to expect.''</p>
        <p>A financial analyst for Towers Perrin, Mr. LaCarrubba was aware that mortgage money is still relatively cheap compared with what it has been over most of the last 30 years. But he added that the difficult ''issue is that prices on properties are so high that you may already be extending yourself.'' But he was undeterred.</p>
        <p>''I guess you just have to find the properties you like and know that there could be a $100 to $300 difference'' in higher monthly payments.</p>
        <p>In general, the highest borrowing rates -- typically on credit cards for those with subpar incomes or repayment histories -- will be hit relatively lightly because the cost of money is a lesser part of the rate than the lenders' cost of administration and write-offs of uncollectible accounts.</p>
        <p>But there will be some direct effect. Citigroup's Citibank, for example, ties its credit card rates to the prime rate, which it raised a half-point yesterday, to 9.5 percent, in lock step with the Fed, as has become the pattern in recent years. The bank's policy is to review these rates on the last business day of the month, meaning that its card rates will rise for July payments on purchases made in June, said Susan Weeks, a spokeswoman.</p>
        <p>Deposit rates, governed by competition as well as the costs of gathering the money, are set by the bank each Thursday and are in effect from the following Tuesday through Monday. Preferred money market accounts now yield 4.59 percent, up from 4.45 two weeks ago. Six-month C.D.'s yield 5.35 percent, up from 5.21. The bank gave no indication what it would decide this Thursday.</p>
        <p>Chase Manhattan also reviews deposit rates each week; its six-month C.D. rate was 5.40 percent yesterday.</p>
        <p>Based on information from the 10 biggest depository institutions in the 10 biggest metropolitan markets, a six-month C.D. was paying 4.99 percent yesterday, compared with 4.12 percent a year ago, and a one-year C.D. was paying 5.39 percent, compared with 4.37 percent.</p>
        <p>As for mortgages, which are subject to monthly examination, rates for adjustable loans at Citibank are tied to Treasury bills while fixed-rate loans fluctuate with bills or other benchmarks.</p>
        <p>But in housing, said Kory Bockmann, economist at the National Association of Realtors, the Fed's move may not be translated into higher rates except in particular circumstances, like for barely qualified or  overreaching buyers.</p>
        <p>''There's probably not going to be too much of an impact,'' he said, ''We may actually see a decline in the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage,'' which is hovering at about 8.5 percent. Rates have already climbed, Mr. Bockmann noted, and by raising short-term rates the Fed may have reassured the markets that it will keep control of inflation, expectations of which over the next decade or so largely determine rates for long-term mortgages.</p>
        <p>Bert Ely, a banking industry consultant in Virginia, said, ''If anything, mortgage rates ought to hold constant or tick down a little bit.'' At the same time, he added, the Internet is helping consumers shop for better rates on both savings accounts and loans. ''We are starting to see a more national market for deposit-taking.''</p>
        <p>Rates on small savings deposits and service-intensive products like checking accounts are relatively low and largely impervious to changes in market rates.</p>
        <p>According to Sung Won Sohn, economist at Wells Fargo, one of the biggest real estate lenders, many consumers are expressing a belief that the rise in rates may be approaching an end, a view the seemingly shared yesterday by the stock and bond markets.</p>
        <p>More than one-third of current mortgage applications are now for floating rates, he said, compared with just 5 percent to 10 percent several months ago. ''More and more people are betting that mortgage rates will go down,'' he said.</p>
