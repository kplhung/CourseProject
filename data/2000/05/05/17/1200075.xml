        <p>GOLD DIGGER  The Outrageous Life and Times of Peggy Hopkins Joyce  By Constance Rosenblum  Illustrated. 293 pages. Metropolitan Books. $26.</p>
        <p>Those who brood that hollow, distinction-free celebrities are an idiosyncrasy of our talk show-driven times might be relieved to learn that other periods had them as well. Peggy Hopkins Joyce was a Broadway showgirl who won fame during the rollicking 1920's for parlaying her knockout looks into a string of rich lovers and husbands. Her forays into stage acting and films were embarrassments, but her tally of generous males -- among them Charlie Chaplin and Walter Chrysler -- was thought to be record-breaking, at least by the day's tabloids.</p>
        <p>She was a barber's daughter from Virginia who not long after arriving in New York in 1915 won deification by Florenz Ziegfeld. In the grand ''Follies''-girl tradition, she was besieged by wealthy suitors and found that she liked men almost as much as they liked her. At a time when virility was measured by the cost of a suitor's gifts, Joyce soon learned that her favorite pastime could be highly remunerative.</p>
        <p>The basic economic equation on which she operated was simplicity itself and was examined fully in the Jule Styne-Leo Robin song, ''Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend.'' (Anita Loos's Lorelei Lee, the character for whom this song was written, was inspired by Joyce.) After a few lines on the subject, however, we get the idea, but Constance Rosenblum, editor of the City section of The New York Times, has written a full-length biography, inspired, we learn, by the discovery of a carton of Joyce's papers and memorabilia.</p>
        <p>Ms. Rosenblum deftly sets up Joyce's erotic magnetism and her flaunting of the rigid morals of the day, when even a twice-married woman was looked upon with disapproval if not scorn. Interestingly, she places Joyce in the context of the great courtesans of the French court (she got less respect, but then Walter Chrysler was no Louis XIV) and compares her to our own day's repeater brides. The reader is ready to become acquainted with a mores-defying free spirit, to tag along on romantic adventures, to encounter some of the day's more diverting luminaries -- in short, to enjoy a romp through the Jazz Age in the company of one of its liveliest figures. Unfortunately, very little of this happens.</p>
        <p>In spite of acknowledgments that run four pages, the book has few interviews with people who knew Joyce, and most of those who are interviewed did not know her well. Even Joyce's last husband, whom Ms. Rosenblum thanks for being ''helpful,'' has little to say: no hint of  her personality or how they spent the six years before she died in 1957. Even the book-prompting carton of memorabilia is a disappointing mishmash of notes from friends, bills from florists, postcards from love-sick suitors and gossip-column clippings. While those odds and ends suggest the outlines of a life, they also establish that as a conserver of biographical documents, Peggy Joyce was no Boswell.</p>
        <p>For its picture of Joyce, the book relies most heavily on mentions in tabloid columns or on other dubious sources like Photoplay magazine and the scandal primer ''Hollywood Babylon.'' Ms. Rosenblum culls anecdotes from Joyce's own memoirs, more often than not adding that the stories are probably untrue.</p>
        <p>For the most part, the public persona is all we get, but even here the book falls short. There are numerous references to Joyce's ''outrageous'' behavior and statements to the press, but when we are presented with illustrations, they land with a thud. An example of her outre behavior tells us that when answering her phone Joyce often disguised her voice as a French maid's. Another divulges that new boyfriends were told by Joyce that a half-knitted wool scarf that she kept around for years was undertaken for them. Readers primed for the gin-soaked debaucheries of the Roaring Twenties might have hoped for a bit more. Banal as these stories are, such glimpses of Joyce in action are scarce.</p>
        <p>Her shockers to the press are equally low-voltage. A typical example was when she was asked by reporters about the assets of the family of a Swedish count she was about to marry. Joyce told them: ''I do not think they have much besides the castle. However, a castle is something after all.'' And later, discussing her husband's nobility (a term Ms. Rosenblum worryingly uses interchangeably with ''royalty'') , Joyce says: ''I could have done better than countess. I could have been a princess or something.'' While endearingly crass, these statements are less than outrageous.</p>
        <p>In an effort to evoke the glamour of Joyce's world, Ms. Rosenblum makes frequent mention of well-known figures of the day like Eddie Cantor, W. C. Fields and Al Jolson, but in linking these names with her heroine falls back on phrases like  ''rubbed elbows with.'' If Joyce interacted with any of these notables, we are not to know. An egregious example of such teasing is an account of Joyce's friction with her ''Follies''-girl colleagues that grew so acrimonious that Ziegfeld removed her to the dressing room of Fanny Brice. Hopes that we have at last hit pay dirt are dashed when the animosity is improbably explained as jealousy over Joyce's being given a line. Although Joyce became friends with Brice, we are offered only two quick glimpses of that legend.</p>
        <p>It was well known that Joyce did more than brush up against Charlie Chaplin, but even the few pages devoted to this romantic interlude prove disappointing. Ms. Rosenblum tells of ''a private frolic'' that Joyce and Chaplin enjoyed on an isolated beach during which the couple was spied from a distance through the binoculars of some locals. The stillborn anecdote seems to encapsulate some of the problems with this book: the scene is viewed from a distance by anonymous peeping Toms unknown to Joyce, it is given only a few cursory lines and we are denied the revealing details, both biographical and prurient, that would seem essential to a book about a woman who possessed, finally, just one talent.</p>
        <p>We are frequently reminded of how famous Joyce was, how the public's interest in her was insatiable and how she was a fixture, in furs and jewels, at the most exciting nightclubs and openings, even turning up in the lyrics of Irving Berlin and Cole Porter as the day's symbol of the naughty madcap. But the reiteration of her notoriety lends a defensive, flap-copy tone to the biography, suggesting that the author shares readers' misgivings about her subject's book-worthiness. A more up-close and revealing book about Peggy Hopkins Joyce might have been fun to read, but there is little in this one to make us think so.</p>
