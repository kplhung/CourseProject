        <p>The Federal Reserve adopted a more aggressive stance today in its fight against inflation, voting to push short-term interest rates up by half a percentage point to try to slow the headlong pace of economic growth.</p>
        <p>Concerned that the economy continues to exceed what the Fed considers to be its speed limit, the central bank put aside its recent preference for small adjustments to monetary policy in favor of an attention-grabbing increase of half a percentage point. The move was intended to make clear that it will do what it takes to bring growth under control.</p>
        <p>Dashing the hopes of investors that this move -- which follows a series of five quarter-point rate increases over the last 11 months -- might be the last for a while, the Fed also signaled that there may well be more to come.</p>
        <p>''Today's move is clearly an escalation of the Fed's anti-inflation campaign,'' said David Orr, chief economist at First Union.</p>
        <p>The Fed's action immediately led some banks to raise their prime lending rates for loans to small business customers to 9.5 percent from 9 percent. It is also likely to lead to higher rates on auto and home equity loans and credit cards. The effect on mortgages is more difficult to predict. [Page C1.]</p>
        <p>It was the first time the central bank raised rates by at least half a percentage point in more than five years, and it lifted the Fed's benchmark federal funds target rate on overnight loans among banks to 6.5 percent, its highest level since January 1991.</p>
        <p>The central bank also raised its seldom-used discount rate on loans to banks from the Federal Reserve system by half a point, to 6 percent.</p>
        <p>By raising the official rates it controls, the Fed tries to put upward pressure on the rates paid by companies and by consumers, and in that way to put a damper on economic activity.</p>
        <p>For all the Fed's concern about inflation over the last year, there is little evidence of any sustained surge in prices or wages, and the move drew criticism from some business groups and political leaders as unnecessary.</p>
        <p>Just hours before the Fed's vote today, the Labor Department reported that consumer prices in April were stable. The consumer price index was unchanged for the month after sharp increases in February and March. And the ''core'' index -- excluding volatile food and energy prices -- rose just 0.2 percent.</p>
        <p>Senator Byron L. Dorgan, a Democrat from North Dakota, said the Fed's interest rate increases amounted to an unjustified tax increase on American families. Jerry Jasinowski, president of the National Association of Manufacturers, said gains in worker productivity, or output per hour, were more than offsetting inflation pressures, and he called the Fed's action ''unnecessary shock treatment.''</p>
        <p>But the Fed, which has always said it is easier to prevent inflation than to eradicate it after it has infected the economy, justified its action as a necessary vaccination.</p>
        <p>In a statement, the Fed's policy- setting Open Market Committee stressed that demand for goods and services from the vibrant business expansion outstripped the available supply, an equation that every basic economic textbook says will eventually lead to rising prices. Not even the gains from productivity can be counted on to keep inflation in check if the economy continues to run red hot, the statement said.</p>
        <p>''The committee is concerned that this disparity in the growth of demand and potential supply will continue,'' the statement said, ''which could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's outstanding performance.''</p>
        <p>In a signal to investors not to assume that this cycle of rate increases is over, the committee added that ''the risks are weighted mainly toward conditions that may generate heightened inflation pressures in the foreseeable future.''</p>
        <p>The Fed's decision to raise rates by half a point had been widely anticipated by investors. Stock prices, which had been up before the Fed's announcement at 2:15 p.m., fell back after right afterward but then rebounded. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 10,934.57, up 126.79. The Nasdaq composite index rose 109.92 to close at 3,717.57. Bond prices also rose, driving the yield on the 10-year Treasury note down to 6.42 percent from 6.45 percent.</p>
        <p>There is considerable debate among economists about how fast the economy can grow without igniting inflation. But even though Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, has been willing to give the economy far more running room than he probably would have just a few years ago, he has consistently said that the ''new economy'' -- in which technology and Internet stocks have made their impact felt -- is still subject to the basic laws of supply and demand.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenspan has focused in particular on the shrinking pool of workers available to employers, noting that eventually wage increases will accelerate to inflationary levels. The unemployment rate -- 3.9 percent in April -- is the lowest in more than 30 years.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenspan has also said that the economy has been able to meet the robust demand from consumers in part by importing more goods from abroad, a trend that the United States cannot afford to sustain forever. To the degree that additional demand cannot be met from abroad, it could lead to a surge in prices.</p>
        <p>After months in which he singled out the stock market as the source of much of the excess demand in the economy, Mr. Greenspan has publicly shifted his emphasis in recent months to slowing the economy and halting the decline in unemployment.</p>
        <p>But despite the five previous rate increases starting last June, the economy grew 7.3 percent in the fourth quarter of last year and 5.4 percent in the first quarter of this year. That was well above the roughly 4 percent that many economists now think is sustainable without generating higher inflation.</p>
        <p>There are some signs that the earlier rate increases are having an effect. Consumer spending, the primary engine of demand in this business cycle, cooled off somewhat in April, with retail sales falling 0.2 percent. But other indicators, like the pace of housing starts and auto sales, suggest that the economy remains in overdrive.</p>
        <p>Whether the Fed raises rates again at its next meeting in late June -- and by how much -- largely depends on what the economic data reveals over the next five weeks. Many economists now assume that the Fed will raise rates by at least another quarter point in June.</p>
        <p>''They certainly leave the way open to further tightening, and almost certainly further tightening will occur,'' said Bruce Steinberg, chief economist at Merrill Lynch. ''The question is how much.''</p>
        <p>The Fed's goal is not to stop the economy in its tracks, but to achieve a ''soft landing,'' in which inflation pressures recede but the expansion continues at a more moderate pace, avoiding a recession.</p>
        <p>The last time the Fed tried to engineer a soft landing, in 1994 and early 1995, it succeeded, but only after doubling its target rate to 6 percent from 3 percent in seven steps. In that cycle it raised rates by half a point three times and by three-quarters of a point once.</p>
        <p>Based on his record in keeping the expansion going, Mr. Greenspan has enjoyed widespread bipartisan support even as he has raised interest rates. Both Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas have expressed confidence in him, and so far the Fed has not been an issue in the presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>The Fed has rarely been shy about tinkering with interest rates during presidential campaigns, but it has always avoided doing so in the month or so before the election. Some analysts suggested that today's action was intended to get as much monetary tightening as possible out of the way before the campaign gets into full gear.</p>
        <p>''If the Fed's job is done by June 28, and we believe that it will be, there won't be a need to act closer to the election,'' said Richard Yamarone, director of economic research at Argus Research. ''In that case, the Fed will have stayed ahead of the curve and taken the Federal Reserve and the tightening cycle out of the political process.''</p>
