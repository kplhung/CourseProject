        <p>The original structure of Riverside Church, the massive neo-Gothic structure in Upper Manhattan, was designated a landmark yesterday by the city's Landmarks Preservation Commission, but a newer wing was not included.</p>
        <p>The designation had been a source of disagreement both within the church's council and between the church and historic preservationists since the commission began considering Riverside for landmark status in 1998. At that time, a group called Friends and Members of Riverside Church, angered by the council's plan to alter the church entrance on Claremont Avenue and parts of its Stone Gymnasium in the southern wing, known as the Martin Luther King Jr. Wing, asked the commission to protect the entire church with landmark status.</p>
        <p>At first, some members of the church council opposed the designation, worried that it would limit their ability to alter the structure, said Michael Winger, a member of the council. The commission imposes stringent regulations that curtail or prohibit significant alteration of the architectural features of landmarks.</p>
        <p>The church council later voted to nominate the church's main sanctuary, completed in 1930, as a historic landmark, but not the Martin Luther King Jr. Wing, which was completed 25 years later.</p>
        <p>Neighborhood preservationists, who have argued that the wing was part of the original design, have pushed the commission to designate the entire complex.</p>
        <p>The steel-framed church, designed by the architects Henry C. Pelton and Allen &amp; Collens, sits on two city blocks between 120th and 122nd Streets, and between Riverside Drive and Claremont Avenue, in Morningside Heights. The main sanctuary, including a 392-foot tower and a nave inspired by Chartres Cathedral, was financed by John D. Rockefeller Jr. Its tower holds one of the world's largest carillons, with 74 bells.</p>
        <p>Although only the original portion of the church was designated yesterday, Jennifer Raab, chairwoman of the commission, said the board would continue to consider the southern wing and might eventually designate it.</p>
        <p>Howard B. Hornstein, a lawyer for the church, said the council would continue to oppose landmark status for the southern wing. ''We've always taken the position that the Martin Luther King building was not architecturally significant,'' he said. ''That will continue to be our position.'' The wing, done in a more modern version of Gothic than the main church, is more boxy and less ornate, and is the administrative center of the church.</p>
        <p>Mr. Winger said the council was still considering altering the wing to create a new entrance.</p>
        <p>L. Ann Rocker, a congregation member who was part of the group that originally approached the commission, said she was pleased with the designation, but added that she hoped the commission would make the entire church a landmark.</p>
        <p>''I am very concerned that the Martin Luther King wing have the same designation as the original building,'' she said. ''Our concern is that they not be taking walls out of any part of that building, and that they not be cutting up the meeting rooms. It's unbelievable that anyone would even think of doing anything like that.''</p>
        <p>Victor Body-Lawson, an architect who drew up plans for the church's alteration, said he had hoped the commission would not include the newer portions of the church.</p>
        <p>''From our standpoint, it's an evolving, growing building, and the designation could possibly hinder its growth process,'' he said. But he added that he thought the current designation was an appropriate compromise. ''Those sections they chose are the perfect ones to designate,'' he said.</p>
