        <p>Taking the offensive against Gov. George W. Bush's proposal to let workers invest some of their Social Security taxes, Vice President Al Gore asserted yesterday that the plan would hurt the very baby boomers it is intended to help by placing their retirement savings at the mercy of ruthless and whimsical markets.</p>
        <p>In an event intended to sway younger voters who have grown accustomed to gravity-defying markets and are more likely to be receptive to the Bush plan, the vice president painted a bleak picture of unsophisticated taxpayers losing their savings in fraudulent, risky or just plain bad investments.</p>
        <p>The result, he warned graduate students at Fordham Business School in Manhattan, would be a costly taxpayer-financed bailout of failed investors that would dwarf the multibillion-dollar rescue of bankrupt savings and loans in the 1980's. And yesterday, Mr. Bush suggested he might support allowing workers to invest a large portion of their payroll taxes, which Mr. Gore said would increase the chances of financial disaster.</p>
        <p>''Tens of millions of investors who have not gone through the Fordham Business School, who have not had an opportunity to gain some basic knowledge to protect themselves against fraud,'' Mr. Gore said, ''would be placed in a situation where a lot of financial shenanigans could take place, where they are losing their investments because they are not equipped in the way that sophisticated investors are. It happens all the time.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush accused the vice president of flip-flopping on the issue, releasing a videotape from January 1999 showing Mr. Gore arguing that it might make sense for the federal government to invest some revenue in the stock market to take advantage of its historically strong returns.</p>
        <p>Asked on the tape whether long-term stock investments would be safe, Mr. Gore replies: ''Over any 10-year period in American history returns on equities are just significantly higher than these other returns. And in order to capture some part of that economic advantage, surely there is a way to solve these problems.''</p>
        <p>When asked about his remarks yesterday, the vice president said that he was talking about investing general tax revenues and not money from the Social Security trust fund -- an idea the Clinton administration was considering at the time. He also suggested that his views had changed after hearing debate over the proposal.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush asserted that Mr. Gore had switched positions for political purposes. ''I believe it's important to be consistent,'' he said in a news conference in Portland, Ore. ''I believe it's important to have somebody willing to take a stand.''</p>
        <p>The day's swirling debate underscored Mr. Gore's desire to block Mr. Bush from seizing the advantage -- particularly among young voters -- on an issue that historically has played to the strengths of Democratic candidates.</p>
        <p>For decades, Social Security has been a powerful Democratic weapon because it is so important to the most active group of voters in the electorate: the elderly. Older people have also tended to vote Democratic, so for years Democrats have successfully turned out their core voters by accusing Republicans of wanting to end or undermine the Social Security system.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bush's proposal could change that dynamic by making Social Security more relevant to younger voters who have grown skeptical about the system's viability but are also comfortable with the idea of investing in Wall Street. Polls show those younger voters supported President Clinton in 1996.</p>
        <p>''I think Bush is slicing into part of the Democratic coalition with this,'' said Andrew Smith, director of polling for the University of New Hampshire. ''But if older voters can be convinced that this plan is a threat to their Social Security, Bush will have problems.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore plans to make that argument to retirees in Florida on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>In making Social Security a major campaign issue, Mr. Gore and Mr. Bush have offered sharply different proposals for extending the life of the system, which is projected to become insolvent by the year 2037.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush argues that allowing workers to invest a small portion of their payroll taxes would enable them to take advantage of the wealth created by Wall Street and reduce the cost to taxpayers of financing the system. But his plan would also leave those investors vulnerable to losses from market fluctuations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore would not change the current system that guarantees a minimum benefit. To prolong the system's life, Mr. Gore proposes using the Social Security surplus to pay down the national debt and then devoting the interest saved to the retirement system. The proposal would keep the system solvent until 2054, he contends.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's event yesterday, like Mr. Gore's, was designed to take the issue beyond the elderly, as he tailored his message to the blue-collar work force at a Portland company that makes railroad freight cars and marine barges.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's advisers contend that such working-class voters are more fiscally conservative, less comfortable with the idea of investing in Wall Street and likely to be opposed to Mr. Bush's plan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush tried to show that was not the case yesterday. Leading a discussion with workers who spoke highly of their 401(k) plan, the governor suggested that opponents of his plan do not trust working Americans to manage their own money.</p>
        <p>''You know I wonder out loud whether there may be some in Washington saying these workers are not smart enough to figure it out,'' Mr. Bush said. ''I wonder whether or not that's what people may be really saying deep down. You can't trust individuals in America who maybe don't have Ph.D.'s in economics.''</p>
        <p>But even as he sought to sell his proposal, Mr. Bush -- who has not provided details for many aspects of the plan -- made several remarks that are likely to provide fodder for additional attacks from Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>First, Mr. Bush left open the possibility that his call for limited accounts was just the first step in a broader transformation of the federal retirement system. Answering a question about his plan, Mr. Bush said that the government could not go ''from one regime to another overnight.'' He said: ''It's going to take a while to transition to a system where personal savings accounts are the predominant part of the investment vehicle. And so, this is a step toward a completely different world and an important step.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has refused to say what proportion of the 12.4 percent payroll tax people could put into private accounts under his plan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also refused to say how much benefits might be reduced for workers who created private investment accounts.</p>
        <p>''That's all up for discussion,'' Mr. Bush said.</p>
        <p>With many finance majors present at his Fordham event, Mr. Gore noted that he supported individuals investing in the stock market for retirement, provided no Social Security funds are involved. But to bolster his point that the markets can be risky, he brought along several experts, including Robert E. Rubin, a Wall Street executive who was Treasury secretary until last year.</p>
        <p>''I've been involved with markets virtually my entire working life,'' Mr. Rubin told the group. ''There is no question, stocks have risks.''</p>
        <p>In many ways, Mr. Gore's arguments might have seemed a tough sell to a youthful audience that was both knowledgeable about financial markets and accustomed to hearing that the best retirement savings are in the stock market.</p>
        <p>Indeed, many students' questions indicated a general support for the idea of private investment accounts. But several students said after the event that Mr. Gore had raised deep questions in their minds about the Bush plan.</p>
        <p>''When he says there are certain to be losers, that's a compelling argument,'' said Scott Horton, a 27-year-old finance major.</p>
