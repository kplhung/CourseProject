        <p>Re ''Park's 'Guitar Man' Is Unplugged and Unhappy'' (news article, May 15):</p>
        <p>I am one of the many New Yorkers who have enjoyed sitting on a hillside in Central Park on a Saturday in the summer listening to David Ippolito, the ''Guitar Man'' in the park, who has been ordered by the New York City Department of Parks and Recreation to unplug his speakers.</p>
        <p>He is a talented musician and singer. I have brought my family and friends who visit the city to listen to him because he represents more than anything else what this great city has to offer, and he dispels the myth that everything costs too much in the city.</p>
        <p>He plays and sings from his heart; I hope the Parks Department will not interfere with his livelihood, which is to entertain his friends on the hill.</p>
