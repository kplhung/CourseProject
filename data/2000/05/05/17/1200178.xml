        <p>New Jersey's two Democratic candidates for the United States Senate clashed over gun control, national security and taxes tonight during their third debate, as each candidate tried to portray himself as the stronger champion of working families and the elderly.</p>
        <p>Jon S. Corzine, who appeared defensive and tongue-tied during much of the first debate last Thursday, has been more confident and lucid in his subsequent outings, and tonight he continued his criticism of the $2.8 billion tax increase that his opponent, Jim Florio, enacted as governor.</p>
        <p>Opening a new line of attack before a standing-room-only audience of 500 at the Temple Beth Shalom Synagogue here, Mr. Corzine also accused Mr. Florio of supporting cuts in defense spending and ending economic sanctions against Iraq.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio, who has tried to use the debates to compensate for his disadvantage in campaign financing, struck back by accusing Mr. Corzine of investing in several gun manufacturers when he was chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company.</p>
        <p>''During the 90's, when Jon, at Goldman Sachs, was financing the gun industry, I was standing up to the gun lobby,'' Mr. Florio said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio also rebutted Mr. Corzine's criticism of his tax increase by pointing out that Mr. Corzine was one of the most generous contributors to his re-election campaign, giving the maximum legal donation to both his primary and general election efforts.</p>
        <p>''I'm startled to see this opportunistic political expediency come forward,'' Mr. Florio said, to cheers and laughs from the audience.</p>
        <p>Although this was the third encounter between the candidates in a week -- with the final debate scheduled for Thursday -- Mr. Corzine has come under criticism in recent days because he has agreed to debates on small radio stations and cable television outlets but has refused to attend a May 26 debate sponsored by the League of Women voters, to be broadcast on network television.</p>
        <p>Tonight's encounter was scheduled to be televised in excerpted form Wednesday night by the Regional News Network, a cable station that reaches a limited number of homes in northern New Jersey.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Corzine, whose unfettered campaign spending has filled the airwaves with a barrage of television and radio ads, has little to gain strategically by participating in uncontrolled forums like debates. He points out that some of Mr. Florio's previous campaigns included fewer than four debates.</p>
        <p>It is not clear, however, if the debates have changed the dynamic of this race. Mr. Corzine, a political unknown when he declared his interest in the Senate seat last February, has spent more than $15 million of his own money on a flood of television advertisements during the last eight weeks. There is little reliable polling available, because poll respondents are notoriously untrustworthy when asked if they will vote in a primary, but both campaigns believe that Mr. Corzine has narrowed Mr. Florio's once-formidable lead, and some suggest that Mr. Corzine is slightly ahead.</p>
        <p>So with three weeks remaining before the June 6 primary, the contest has become increasingly heated. Mr. Florio, who has money for television advertisements only during the final two weeks of the campaign, has tried to halt Mr. Corzine's momentum by portraying him as out of tune with the concerns of working families and as politically naive.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Corzine expressed his support tonight for President Clinton's nuclear missile shield ''within the context of negotiations with Russia,'' Mr. Florio said he was being duped by Congressional Republicans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine has accompanied the week of debates with an acceleration in spending, which is likely to shatter all records for primary candidates. After the candidates' radio debate on Monday, Mr. Corzine unveiled three new television ads. And in recent weeks, his voice has been heard on a growing number of radio stations and his face has become a familiar sight on buses and billboards.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine has said that his intense television campaign is the only way that a political newcomer can compete with ''professional politicians'' like Mr. Florio, whose name recognition in New Jersey is nearly universal.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Florio has branded Mr. Corzine's proposal to invest part of the Social Security trust fund in the stock market as a risky scheme that might send elderly Americans to ''the poor house,'' Mr. Corzine did not back away from the plan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine asserted that he supported President Clinton's Social Security plan, which would use the nation's present prosperity to help ensure the economic well-being of elderly Americans in the decades to come.</p>
