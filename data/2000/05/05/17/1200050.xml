        <p>IT is easy to lose one's way when driving through the neighborhoods of this city, especially in those hours before dawn when the street signs above the corner tabacs, boulangeries and patisseries fade into darkness. The new Cadillac Seville that had cruised so majestically down the Champs-Elysees the night before now crept tentatively through the narrow, deserted streets while the driver rehearsed his supplicative refrain: ''Excusez-moi de vous deranger, Monsieur; ou est la rue. . . . ?''</p>
        <p>Up ahead, a figure emerged from a small hotel lugging cartons to the street and the car slid over to the curb. But before the driver could utter a word, the grinning hotelier approached to ask, in perfect English: ''Hi. Are you lost?'' In a manner of speaking, yes. But, how could he tell the driver was American?</p>

        <p>IT is easy to lose one's way when driving through the neighborhoods of this city, especially in those hours before dawn when the street signs above the corner tabacs, boulangeries and patisseries fade into darkness. The new Cadillac Seville that had cruised so majestically down the Champs-Elysees the night before now crept tentatively through the narrow, deserted streets while the driver rehearsed his supplicative refrain: ''Excusez-moi de vous deranger, Monsieur; ou est la rue. . . . ?''</p>
        <p>Up ahead, a figure emerged from a small hotel lugging cartons to the street and the car slid over to the curb. But before the driver could utter a word, the grinning hotelier approached to ask, in perfect English: ''Hi. Are you lost?'' In a manner of speaking, yes. But, how could he tell the driver was American?</p>
        <p>''Ah, that is easy,'' said the hotel man, who introduced himself as Mory Mirza, the night manager at the Hotel Britannique. ''Who else would be driving around Paris in a brand-new Cadillac but an American?''</p>
        <p>That was a good question, and there are  billions of dollars riding on the answer, as slumping sales at home have prompted General Motors, the maker of Cadillac, to explore markets overseas.</p>
        <p>According to G.M.'s plan, there will soon be thousands of well-heeled French citizens rolling through the tonier arrondissements of Paris behind the leather-wrapped steering wheels of gleaming new Sevilles, and tens of thousands more Cadillac owners motoring across Europe, Asia, the Middle East, Africa and the Caribbean.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, G.M. intends for 1 in every 5 Cadillacs to be sold through a dealership outside the United States. General Motors is revamping the overseas distribution network that John Smith, a former Cadillac general manager in Detroit, once described as a ''loose, spontaneous confederation'' and converting importers to factory-franchised dealerships, of which there are currently 87 in Europe and 700 in 70 countries worldwide.</p>
        <p>The model charged with revitalizing Cadillac's sales overseas is the Seville, which, with its more compact wheelbase (more so, at least, than the DeVille) and its understated styling, was anointed Cadillac's ''world car'' upon its debut in 1998.</p>
        <p>Soon to come, though no date has been announced, is the sleek, supercharged Evoq roadster; the two-seater has been such a hit on the auto show circuit that it has spawned yet another concept car, the Imaj, an aluminum-bodied, four-wheel-drive sedan with a Northstar-based, 425 horsepower V-8, designed with the high-performance European market in mind. Next month, Cadillac will return to the 24 Hours of Le Mans for the first time in a half-century with a Scott Riley-built prototype powered by a twin-turbo version of the Northstar engine; a Seville will serve as pace car for the race.</p>
        <p>Heady stuff, and if Mr. Mirza's reaction to the Seville is any index of the car's appeal overseas, Cadillac's prospects of cracking the European market should not be underestimated. ''The French cars are nothing, next to this,'' Mr. Mirza exulted, running a hand along the car's flanks. ''This is gorgeous.''</p>
        <p>There was just one catch: ''Too bad I can't afford one,'' he sighed. ''I guess I'll go on driving my old Mercedes.''</p>
        <p>These days, every Cadillac sale, at home or abroad, counts. General Motors' global ambitions notwithstanding, Cadillac registrations in all of Europe dipped to 984 in 1999 from 1,259 in 1998.</p>
        <p>But nobody said it would be easy. ''Our first job is to erase the prejudice against big American sedans,'' said Michael Klaus, G.M.'s marketing director for North American Vehicles, Europe. ''Seville has the design, the handling and the power to do this. Our fuel economy is competitive, too, considering the car has a big V-8 engine. But it's going to take several years; the European market just doesn't know the product.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, a sense of wonder pervades French reviews of the car, as if the metaphysics of the Seville's very presence on European soil outweighed petty technical considerations. According to Paris Match, the car ''emanates a sense of stately grace,  which certain European lines might envy.''</p>
        <p>The automotive weekly L'Argus observed that General Motors ''possesses in its fishpond of marques a true treasure: Cadillac.'' Accompanying these raves was some minor grousing about the car's handling on the back roads, the lateral support of the seats, the styling and the way the car downshifted.</p>
        <p>In the greater scheme of things, however, Cadillac's problem is not so much those who do not know the product, but rather those who know it best -- American car buyers.</p>
        <p>IN 1998, slumping stateside sales spurred Cadillac to fabricate the figures needed to claim pre-eminence in the domestic luxury market, a position it had enjoyed for 49 years. When the figures were revised and cars still standing on Cadillac dealers' lots were subtracted, Lincoln emerged as the 1998 luxury champ, with sales of 187,121 compared with Cadillac's 182,570.</p>
        <p>In 1999 Cadillac's malaise was compounded when the marque slumped to third place in the luxury arena, with sales of 178,507, tailing Mercedes's 189,437 and Lexus's 185,890.</p>
        <p>''The problem is, Cadillac has lost sight of what it stood for,'' said John Grace, director of Interbrand, a Manhattan-based brand consultancy. ''In the 1940's, 1950's and 1960's, everyone aspired to own one; it made a statement about the owner. Since the 1980's, its values have faded into ambiguity.</p>
        <p>''Everybody knows what Mercedes stands for: uncompromising quality and reliability. BMW is the ultimate driving experience. But there are no Cadillac values any more. It's been driven by expediency; it's chasing the demographic-of-the-month.''</p>
        <p>Whatever it stood for before, Cadillac's descent on the slippery slope of ambivalence accelerated in May 1981 with the introduction of the Cimarron; behind that gold Cadillac crest, car buyers found a Chevy Cavalier econobox with an underpowered four-cylinder engine.</p>
        <p>In 1994, with gas lines gone the way of mood rings, Cadillac introduced the Concours, a slab-sided, fender-skirted, six-passenger behemoth with a 270-horsepower V-8 beneath the hood. The Concours was designed to woo baby boomers with sporty performance in a car that looked like what their grandparents were driving; after four years it joined the Cimarron in memory.</p>
        <p>The incongruities mounted in 1996 when Cadillac boasted the most powerful engine ever in a front-wheel-drive production car: the 300-horsepower Northstar. This contradicted the luxury market's preference for the comfort and performance of rear-wheel-drive, which is why every other upscale carmaker -- Mercedes, BMW, Jaguar, Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Audi and Lincoln -- eschews front-wheel-drive in its most expensive sedans.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, Cadillac abandoned the full-sized, rear-wheel-drive paradigm at the end of the 1996 model year, and eliminated the Brougham from the lineup.</p>
        <p>About the same time, the carmaker unveiled its new Catera, a rear-wheel midsize sedan based on the German-made Opel that evoked echoes of the Cimarron. ''We told G.M. the Catera would have made a great Saturn,'' said James Hossack, the senior vice president at Auto Pacific, an automotive product and market research firm in Orange County, Calif., whose clients include General Motors. ''But it makes a terrible Cadillac. Who wants a luxury car with a six-cylinder engine and no more horsepower than a Honda Accord?''</p>
        <p>In 1998, Cadillac clambered aboard the sport-utility-vehicle bandwagon with the Escalade, a $46,900 version of the $28,520 Chevrolet Tahoe. ''Funny,'' Mr. Hossack said. ''The Tahoe got a new, improved platform for 2000 while the far more expensive Escalade retains the old one.''</p>
        <p>If Cadillac's luxury lineup is bemusing, most people in the automotive industry consider its advertising of recent years a disaster. Cadillac executives turn apoplectic when reminded of 1997's ''Catera Duck'' campaign with its tag line, ''The car that zigs.'' Now playing in prime time is Cadillac's new theme, ''The power of &amp;.''</p>
        <p>''It says absolutely nothing,'' said Mr. Grace, of Interbrand.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, Mr. Hossack observed: ''How can you advertise a lineup that includes a six-cylinder luxury car and a luxury truck based on an outdated Chevy platform? And who wants a front-wheel-drive, full-size luxury car?''</p>
        <p>Well, the French might. ''We've grown up with front-wheel drive; we know how to handle it,'' said Jean Claude Dutailly, who conforms precisely to the demographic profile projected for the Seville. Mr. Dutailly, 53, is general manager of the battery division of Saft, a division of the French conglomerate Alcatel, and as such drives a company car, a Peugeot 605. ''When you are an executive in France, it's expected that you will drive a French car,'' he said, while wheeling the Seville through the Paris traffic on a test drive.</p>
        <p>''This is really very nice, very comfortable,'' he continued. ''It feels like you can drive it 500 miles and still be fresh. And compared to the Mercedes S Class or the BMW 7, it is a bargain. And the guarantee, you can keep it 10 years without much trouble, non?''</p>
        <p>So, would he buy a Seville? ''With all that it offers,'' he said, ''the style, the ride, the performance, the comfort -- yes. Oh, not as long as I'm working in France. But if I lived in the States, definitely.''</p>
