        <p>For people on the go who don't want to buy bottled water, Brita, a company that makes charcoal filters for removing chlorine, odors and unpleasant flavors from water, has introduced a 20-ounce water bottle with a small carbon filter about the size of a cigarette lighter in its cap. The plastic bottle has a blue push-pull cap and a spot to place a sticker to remind the user to replace the filter every hundred refills or so. The bottle is about $8 at housewares stores, and replacement filters are about $3.50.</p>
