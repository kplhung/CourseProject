        <p>NORTHERN IRELAND: GOVERNMENT DELAY -- Britain dropped hopes of restoring the suspended power-sharing government in Belfast on Monday after leaders of the Ulster Unionists objected to proposals for restricting the flying of the Union Jack from government buildings and for changing the Royal Ulster Constabulary's name. Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson agreed to hold up on starting the government until after the Protestant party votes on Saturday on whether to accept disarmament moves by the Irish Republican Army.</p>

        <p>TURKEY: PRESIDENT SWORN IN -- Ahmet Necdet Sezer, a former top judge, was sworn in as the new president and said in a brief speech after his inauguration that Turkey ''cannot remain closed within itself'' and should concentrate on ''securing the rule of law and democracy.'' Mr. Sezer, 58, replaced Suleyman Demirel, a veteran politician who had sought unsuccessfully to amend the Constitution so he could seek a second term.</p>

        <p>BELARUS: VOTE CHANGES PROPOSED -- The country's autocratic leader, Aleksandr Lukashenko, has agreed to negotiate changes in restrictive election laws next month with pro-democracy forces, an aide said. But some in the opposition, believing the move a feint, are demanding rights reforms and international supervision of any talks first.</p>

        <p>FRANCE: INTERNET COLLEGE -- France will set up a college dedicated to the Internet and provide more money for technology research, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin announced. The school, near Marseille, will offer a university education to gifted students and to people seeking retraining in the growing Internet market. Mr. Jospin said France would make more cash available to researchers.</p>

        <p>PALESTINIANS: 'MOST WANTED' SEIZED -- Officials of the militant Hamas group have confirmed that the Palestinian Authority recently arrested Mohammed Deif, who has long headed Israel's most wanted list for terror attacks. He was seized and went quietly when Palestinian agents stormed a Gaza City house. Palestinian officials have refused to confirm the arrest publicly because, one official said, ''The people are giving us enough grief about refugees and prisoners.''</p>

        <p>LEBANON: DUBLIN INCREASING TROOPS -- Ireland is the first country to agree to bolster its troops serving in the United Nations forces in southern Lebanon before Israel's withdrawal, Israeli radio said. Denmark, Norway and Sweden have also been asked to send in more troops.</p>

        <p>IRAN: ANOTHER PAPER CLOSED -- The hard-line judiciary shut down another pro-reform newspaper, Ham-Mihan, accusing it of ''advocating lies and suspicion.'' The paper is published by the former mayor of Tehran, Gholamhossein Karbaschi. A total of 18 papers and journals have been closed since the press crackdown began last month.</p>

        <p>INDIA: FOOD PROTESTS -- Sonia Gandhi, India's main opposition leader, led a march through New Delhi, protesting the government's decision to reduce subsidies on food and cooking fuel. She threatened that her Congress Party will continue street agitation until the cuts are reversed.</p>

        <p>INDONESIA: WIRANTO QUITS -- The former army chief, Gen. Wiranto, resigned from his cabinet post three months after he was suspended over his reported links to the campaign of violence in East Timor last year. General Wiranto announced he was quitting after prosecutors questioned him for seven hours over allegations he was partly responsible for the bloodshed and destruction in East Timor.</p>

        <p>CANADA: RARE VICTORY -- The Conservative Party won a rare victory, narrowly holding on to a parliamentary seat in a Newfoundland by-election. The victory, in a district dominated by conservatives since Newfoundland joined Canada in 1949, came after the party had lost leaders, strategists, donors and legislators, largely to a new right-wing party, the Canadian Alliance. The Conservatives, who formed Canada's first government in 1867, are reduced to 18 members of Parliament.</p>

        <p>COLOMBIA: PEACE TALKS CANCELED -- Accusing the country's largest guerrilla group of responsibility for the death of a woman who was blown to pieces in an extortion attempt, President Andres Pastrana has ordered the cancellation of peace talks the rebels convened for this month. Mr. Pastrana said the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, who denied any involvement, must show ''a change of attitude'' if peace talks begun last year are to succeed.</p>

        <p>VENEZUELA: COALITION SPLIT -- With a general election little more than two weeks away, one of the three parties in the coalition led by President Hugo Chavez has pulled out. The left-wing Fatherland for All movement said it was worried about the militarization of Mr. Chavez's government. The decision has raised questions about the future of Minister of Energy Ali Rodriguez, a founder of the party and president of the Organization of Oil Exporting Countries.</p>
