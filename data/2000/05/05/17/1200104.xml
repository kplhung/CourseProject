        <p>At the height of the Asian financial crisis in 1998, Scott Fedje, an art director for a Fortune 500 apparel manufacturer, returned to his company's headquarters in the northwestern United States from a five-year stint in Hong Kong.

        <p>At the height of the Asian financial crisis in 1998, Scott Fedje, an art director for a Fortune 500 apparel manufacturer, returned to his company's headquarters in the northwestern United States from a five-year stint in Hong Kong. Even though he got a promotion and a pay increase as a reward for his overseas performance, Mr. Fedje resigned a few months later to take a job with a design-consulting firm in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>''I felt lost,'' said Mr. Fedje (fed-GEE), who asked that his former employer not be identified.  ''Most of us who returned went from a position of high responsibility and a dynamic environment to a cubicle, a project and a whole month to make a single decision.'' He missed old colleagues who had moved on, he said, and he longed for the kind of cultural stimulation he had found in Asia. So when he was offered work in the Bay Area, he grabbed it, and now he heads the retail design division of the firm, Landor Associates.</p>
        <p>Call it the exodus of the returned expatriates. Every year, thousands of executives like Mr. Fedje arrive home from foreign postings and bolt to greener pastures, often at a cost to their employers of $1 million or more that was invested in training and overseas expenses. Dr. J. Stewart Black, managing director of the Center for Global Assignments, a consulting firm based in San Diego that works with executives going and coming from abroad, said that two-thirds of the returning executives and their family members he had interviewed described repatriation as a more wrenching experience than the overseas postings themselves. ''It's a staggering statistic and problematic for employers,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Just as alarming for corporations is the defection rate of returning managers. Twenty-five percent leave within a year, double the proportion of departures by those who never go abroad, Dr. Black said. And the returned managers who leave typically go to the competition.</p>
        <p>Dr. Black cited an extreme case of a company that over a two-year period lost every manager it had sent on international assignments within 12 months of their return -- 25 people in all. The company ''might just as well have written a check for $50 million and tossed it to the winds,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The biggest shock for managers fresh from foreign postings appears to be the change in their status from a big frog in a small pond to a small frog in a big one. Many also discover that the skills they acquired overseas, and the acquaintances they cultivated, are of little use to them now.</p>
        <p>''It has left me depressed,'' said an executive at a large transportation company who came back to the United States at the end of last year after spending four years in Southeast Asia. The executive, who insisted on anonymity, added that he now felt like ''just another cog in a bureaucratic wheel.''</p>
        <p>Family members can also go through reverse culture shock, compounding the pressure on the breadwinner. When her husband was sent back to the United States after two years in Tokyo for a small semiconductor company, Sylvia Dickinson of Menlo Park, Calif., felt out of sorts and concerned about her daughter's adjustment to American schools.</p>
        <p>''People did not want to hear about our life abroad after two seconds,'' she said. ''It's difficult to simply shut out a life-transforming experience like that. You don't just pick up where you left off either.''</p>
        <p>Her husband, Tom, worked on ad hoc projects until he was recruited away by Cirrus Logic, a competitor that she said now capitalizes on his international background. She has capitalized on it, too, starting Dickinson Consulting, a firm that counsels outbound and returning executives and their families. ''Having been there and back, I can offer an empathetic ear,'' Ms. Dickinson said.</p>
        <p>So, what do companies do to hold onto their talent? Robert Greenleaf, executive director at TMC, a consulting firm in Princeton, N.J., that specializes in preparing executives for overseas posts, says rule No. 1 is to write down, in clear terms, what they expect the departing executives to achieve abroad and what they expect them to do when they come back.</p>
        <p>Dr. Black cited companies like Monsanto that start thinking about next assignments for expatriates three to six months before they return. At Monsanto, two senior officials with international experience assess the skills that the overseas executive has gained on the tour of duty and review the job openings that are available. At the same time, the returning executive writes a report, assessing his skills and describing his career goals. The three then meet to decide his future.</p>
        <p>Paul Kocourek, a senior partner at Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton, knows about repatriation. He went through it three times, after stints with the Peace Corps in Thailand in the 1970's, Bain &amp; Company in Tokyo in the 80's and Booz, Allen in Australia in the late 80's and most of the 90's.</p>
        <p>His familiarity with the process enabled him to draw up a short list of hints for making a successful re-entry. The returning expatriate, he said, should try flying home a number of times during the final stages of the overseas stay to cement relationships with people in the home office, meet with clients and discuss a future role in the company. And the executive should ensure that clients and projects are properly handed over to the overseas successor.</p>
        <p>''Maintaining one's network and having a mentor or sponsor back at headquarters to keep tabs on you helps,'' Mr. Kocourek said.</p>
        <p>Re-entry can be especially wrenching if the home office has more or less forgotten about you. That is what Deborah Burks, a 37-year-old Chicago executive, said happened to her. Ms. Burks was dispatched to Hong Kong in 1998 to build a regional presence for the digital-media division of a Fortune 500 chemicals company based on the West Coast. But despite what she said were significant inroads that she had made, the company decided to halt its expansion effort there.</p>
        <p>''There was neither a contingency nor any accountability within the division or company,'' Ms. Burks said.</p>
        <p>She returned last year to Chicago, where she had been posted before -- except that now she ended up in an office with little to do. She had sold her Chicago home, believing she would be away for an extended period, and had to shop for a place to stay. Her company told her of jobs available in a small town in Ohio, but she decided not to pursue them. In the end, she found a job as a director for new business development at R. R. Donnelley &amp; Sons. She is not bitter, she said, and in fact believes that her international experience taught her invaluable skills in coping with changes in the corporate world.</p>
        <p>''I would still do it over again but be more mentally prepared for the risk,'' she said.</p>
        <p>As for employers, the best thing they can do to keep returning stars is to keep channels of communication open even long after an overseas assignment has been completed.</p>
        <p>''If an executive is feeling unease, he should be able to speak up and have a nonthreatening forum to do so in,'' said Dennis Kaminsky, who spent two tours of duty in Japan for the plastics division of the General Electric Company.</p>
        <p>''Coming home is always a wonderful feeling,'' Mr. Kaminsky said. ''It's having the environment to express this and any other feelings that can make a world of difference.''</p>
