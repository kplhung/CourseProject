        <p>Stall 40 in Barn E at Pimlico Race Course is reserved every year for the winner of the Kentucky Derby, making it the royal stall for horses arriving for the Preakness, the second race of the Triple Crown. But five days before the 125th Preakness, Stall 40 was empty, with advance notice that it will not be the home of this year's Derby winner, Fusaichi Pegasus.</p>
        <p>Fusaichi Pegasus was set to arrive at Pimlico on Wednesday on an all-star flight from Churchill Downs, where he won the Derby a week and a half ago. His trainer, Neil Drysdale, ever cautious, always shielding his rich horse, has elected to stable him in Barn 7 on the backstretch, three furlongs from Stall 40 and the rest of the clamorous ''Preakness Barn,'' where television crews and newspaper writers gather to monitor the celebrity horses and interview their trainers.</p>
        <p>Drysdale flew to Pimlico over the weekend, inspected the premises and decided that Fusaichi Pegasus would be calmer and less excitable if he stayed far away from the Preakness commotion. His colt, whose balky nature did not surface in the Derby, will yield Stall 40 to Bob Baffert, who promptly assigned it to Captain Steve, who finished eighth in the Derby after a troubled trip.</p>
        <p>''There's a bit more room, and it's the quietest part,'' Drysdale said of the switch. ''The horse looks in pretty good order. He has gained back the weight he lost in the Derby.''</p>
        <p>One horse was added to the Preakness today when Todd Pletcher confirmed that he would enter Impeachment, third in the Arkansas Derby, second in the Tampa Bay Derby and third in the Kentucky Derby field of 19. Pletcher made his decision after Impeachment zipped half a mile at Belmont Park this morning in 48 seconds, galloping out five furlongs in 1:00 flat.</p>
        <p>''He went great,'' the trainer said from New York today. ''Craig Perret will ride him, and he'll van down there Thursday.''</p>
        <p>Cot Campbell, president of Dogwood Stable, which owns Impeachment, said: ''Our colt will again drop 20 lengths out of it and make his run from the half-mile pole.''</p>
        <p>Campbell acknowledged that he had been aiming Impeachment for the Belmont Stakes, the third leg in the Triple Crown, at a mile and a half on June 10. But he added, ''Impeachment needs a race before then, and the million-dollar Preakness is a juicy sort of prep race.''</p>
        <p>The addition of Impeachment meant that a short field of eight horses would go to the post Saturday for the Preakness, which will be run at a mile and three-sixteenths. The number stayed at eight when Carl Nafzger indicated it was unlikely that Unshaded, winner of the Lexington Stakes, would run. The colt did not run in the Derby and his owner, James Tafel, would have to post a supplemental fee of $100,000 to enter him in the Preakness.</p>
        <p>In addition to Impeachment, the only survivors of the Derby who will challenge Fusaichi Pegasus in the Preakness are High Yield, who finished 15th; Hal's Hope, who ran 16th after leading for one mile, and Captain Steve. In 13 starts, High Yield has finished in the money 11 times; he ran out of the money twice at Churchill Downs.</p>
        <p>''We're not here trying to beat one horse.'' said his trainer, D. Wayne Lukas. ''We're here because we want to win. We don't pick out horses to beat in some kind of obsession.''</p>
        <p>The trainer of Hal's Hope, the 88-year-old Harold Rose, reported that both he and his horse seemed to be bearing up well on the Triple Crown trail. ''He jogged a mile and galloped a mile and a half,'' Rose said. ''That's really all he needs. If he's not fit now, he'll never be.''</p>
        <p>Captain Steve got the green light after he worked five furlongs Monday in 581/5  seconds at Churchill Downs, a move that persuaded Baffert to ticket him on the same flight with Fusaichi Pegasus. The colt won the Hollywood Futurity last December, then ran third in three stakes races before the Derby.</p>
        <p>The only Preakness horses already stabled at Pimlico were High Yield, Hal's Hope and Red Bullet, the winner of the Gotham at Aqueduct, whose three-race winning streak ended when he trailed Fusaichi Pegasus by more than four lengths in the Wood Memorial.</p>
        <p>Snuck In, who was first in the Rebel Stakes and second in the Arkansas Derby, breezed half a mile this morning at Churchill Downs in 48 seconds flat. His trainer, Steve Asmussen, reported: ''We're all set. He was a little flat in the Arkansas Derby, a little farther back than in his other races, but he has been training much better. I think he's moved forward consistently since then. He'll have to.''</p>
        <p>The eighth colt in the Preakness, the long shot Hugh Hefner, finished 13th of 14 in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile but ran well in his five other starts on the West Coast. His trainer, Martin Jones, hoping for rain to fall on Fusaichi Pegasus and his parade, said of his horse: ''He loves slop.''</p>
