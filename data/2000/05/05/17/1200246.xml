        <p>A year ago, the Assembly speaker, Jack Collins, asked the school to research commercial technology that would prevent guns from working for anyone other than designated users.

        <p>So-called smart guns may not be available for at least five years, according to preliminary findings announced yesterday by the New Jersey Institute of Technology.</p>
        <p>A year ago, the Assembly speaker, Jack Collins, asked the school to research commercial technology that would prevent guns from working for anyone other than designated users. A bill sponsored by Mr. Collins's likely rival for governor next year, the Senate president, Donald T. DiFrancesco, would require the technology in New Jersey two years after it became available commercially.</p>
        <p>Donald Sebastian, the institute's vice president for technology research, said reliable smart-gun technology would probably involve fingerprinting because of its potential for other commercial uses.</p>
        <p>It could take three years to develop what would probably be a form of microelectronic system, he said, and two more years for it to be adopted by gun makers. A final report is due in December.</p>
