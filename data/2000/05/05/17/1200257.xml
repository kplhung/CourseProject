        <p>McDONALD-Kathryn A. The Board of Directors, the President's Council, the management and staff of The Legal Aid Society are saddened by the death of Kathryn A. McDonald, our beloved friend who championed the cause of quality representation for children as an attorney and supervisor at the Society and as a distinguished Family Court Judge. Her leadership, wise counsel, and insight were sources of inspiration to the Board and management for many years. Kay's lifetime of unceasing contributions to equal justice were recognized last year when she received the Society's Servant of Justice Award. Kay's intelligence, warmth, her sense of humor and great integrity held our respect and won our hearts. We will miss her greatly. We extend our sincere condolences to her daughter, Anne. D.
