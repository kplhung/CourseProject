        <p>Capitalizing on defensive mistakes by the Devils, the Flyers extinguished a two-goal deficit in a three-minute span tonight and scored a 4-3 triumph over the Devils to even the four-of-seven-game Eastern Conference finals at one game apiece.</p>
        <p>The Devils had a two-goal lead at First Union Center with less than a minute left in the second period, but mistakes by three Devils defensemen helped the Flyers take the lead for good before the third period was two minutes old.</p>
        <p>''We had a lapse there for three minutes,'' Devils Coach Larry Robinson said of the three quick goals by the Flyers. ''We lost our composure and kept running around. Our positioning was not good.''</p>
        <p>Rick Tocchet tied the score for the Flyers with his second goal of the night, 66 seconds into the third, before Daymond Langkow broke the tie 52 seconds later. Eric Desjardins started Philadelphia's rally with 38.8 seconds left in the second against Martin Brodeur, who faced 30 shots and who essentially could not be blamed for any of the goals.</p>
        <p>''The whole game was decided in those three minutes,'' Brodeur said. ''We're not here to look at things negatively.</p>
        <p>''We'll get back to what brought us here, which is playing more solid defensively.''</p>
        <p>After Tocchet opened the scoring early in the first, the Devils got second-period from Scott Gomez, Jason Arnott and Patrik Elias against Brian Boucher, who faced 33 shots.</p>
        <p>Robinson admitted that his team let a grand opportunity slip away, but added that a split of the first two games in Philadelphia was not all that bad for his team.</p>
        <p>Defenseman Ken Daneyko, who mistakenly thought there was icing, which led to his being out of position before Tocchet's second goal, agreed with Robinson.</p>
        <p>''We had a mental lapse there for three minutes and it cost us,'' Daneyko said., ''But a split here is not the end of the world for us.''</p>
        <p>Game 3 will be Thursday night at Continental Arena in East Rutherford, N.J.</p>
        <p>The Flyers came out with more enthusiasm than they did in Game 1 on Sunday afternoon, a 4-1 Devils victory, and took the lead just 1 minute 38 seconds into tonight's game, with Tocchet scoring his first of the night.</p>
        <p>Tocchet's goal brought life to the sellout crowd of 19,855, which urged the Flyers to look for more.</p>
        <p>They did, and with 3:52 gone, Langkow  set up Mark Recchi in the slot. But Brodeur denied Recchi from point-blank range by plunging to his right. Brodeur's saves inspired the Devils, who tied the score with Gomez's fourth goal of the playoffs, which came with 6:37 left in the first. The Devils came out with a lot more spirit for the second period and dominated the early stages.</p>
        <p>New Jersey scored at 2:51 when Arnott's blistering shot from the slot found the target.</p>
        <p>Elias extended the Devils' lead to 3-1 with 5:10 left in the second, when he beat Boucher from near the bottom of the right circle with a low shot to the far corner.</p>
        <p>The rookie defenseman Colin White of the Devils got caught watching the action near the boards to the right of Brodeur and it cost the Devils dearly in the last minute of the second period.</p>
        <p>Tocchet gained control of the puck and pushed it across to the onrushing Desjardins, who narrowed the deficit to a goal.</p>
        <p>''That second goal came at a good time and it was uplifting for them,'' Bobby Holik said.</p>
        <p>The Flyers scored twice early in the third period, thanks to defensive lapses by the Devils.</p>
        <p>After Tocchet tied the score, Langkow gave the Flyers the lead for good 52 seconds later with a goal that was originally credited to Tocchet.</p>
        <p>That would have given him a hat trick, prompting a mass throwing of hats onto the ice. The puck on that decisive goal went into the net off White.</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>JOHN MADDEN, the defensive specialist for the Devils, suffered an injury to his right knee in a collision with Flyers center KEITH PRIMEAU with 3:02 left in the game. Madden was helped off the ice and did not return. He will have a magnetic resonance imaging exam on Wednesday. . . . Primeau, who made his return on Sunday after suffering a concussion in the last game of the series with Pittsburgh,  engaged RANDY McKAY in a fight midway through the second period. . . . Both teams used the same lineups as in the opening game of the series. . . . The series will resume in New Jersey with games Thursday night and Saturday night.</p>
