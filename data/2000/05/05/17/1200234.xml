        <p>Millions of people search the Internet every month looking for jobs, but for actually landing one, nothing beats the old-fashioned personal touch, the latest studies show.</p>
        <p>While the top 10 Internet job search sites had almost twice as many users in March as they did one year earlier -- 17.4 million versus 8.9 million -- networking and referrals remained the main way people found work. A survey by Drake Beam Morin, a workplace consulting firm, of 7,400 executives who switched jobs last year, showed that just 4 percent found their positions on the Internet, while 64 percent got them by networking.</p>
        <p>Another survey, by Forrester Research, indicated that the majority of people who used job-search sites were generally dissatisfied with the quality of the jobs advertised. Nevertheless, companies and recruiters said they planned to spend more on advertising jobs online than they do now because it is such an efficient way to reach job hunters.</p>
        <p>Todd Hoffman, national director of recruiting for tax and legal services at PricewaterhouseCoopers, said that about 3 percent of the 900 people he has hired this fiscal year made initial contact via the Internet. In the next 12 to 15 months, he said he would like that percentage to be 10 to 12 percent. This is a high priority for us, he said. It is more cost effective.</p>
