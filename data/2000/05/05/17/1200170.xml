        <p>In cafes, on street corners and in front of newsstands, many people in Washington Heights have been heatedly talking for weeks about the tactics of the presidential campaign and the merits of the candidates. But in their rapid-fire Spanish, they aren't speaking of Al Gore or George W. Bush. Instead, they intone the names Balaguer, Mejia and Medina, the three men seeking the presidency of the Dominican Republic.</p>
        <p>And yesterday in the Heights, heart of the nation's largest enclave of immigrants from the Caribbean, the fervor for presidential politics reached a fever pitch as their relatives on the island went to the polls to choose a president.</p>
        <p>That those who stayed in New York could not vote did not seem to matter: they passionately argued politics on street corners, tuned in to Spanish-language broadcasts and phoned relatives on the island.</p>
        <p>''The Dominican, every Dominican immigrant, keeps feeling for his country,'' said Bienvenido Ovalles, 60, turning for a moment away from a heated political discussion on St. Nicholas Avenue. ''The Dominican is very much involved in the election, even though he is absent. He may not be there, but his heart is always in his homeland.''</p>
        <p>Political parties on the island have long known that to get an edge in the fractious world of Dominican politics, it is smart to seek votes and money in New York's Dominican population, which, at around 600,000, is second in size only to the Dominican capital, Santo Domingo.</p>
        <p>That has meant raffles and $500-a-plate fund-raisers in Manhattan hotels and Jimmy's Bronx Cafe. It has meant stump speeches, caravans of cars and rallies where Dominican immigrants have been urged to return home to vote, or even tell their relatives back home whom to vote for. It has meant that Tati Ayala, who works at EZ Vision Tours and Travel, has sold at least 150 airline tickets to Dominicans who, she said, flew home simply to vote.</p>
        <p>''This is like a small slice of the Dominican Republic, like a city in the Republic,'' said Mario Caraballo, a local organizer for the Social Christian Reformist Party, whose leader is the former president, Joaquin Balaguer, 93. ''The parties have organized here because the people here are an economic power.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Silvio Torres-Saillant, director of the Dominican Studies Institute at City College, said Dominican political parties have become highly adept at stirring nationalist sentiment among the rapidly growing Dominican population.</p>
        <p>''The political parties have done an excellent job of keeping Dominicans from breaking their political umbilical cord, by turning New York City and all Dominican neighborhoods throughout the United States into arenas for island politics,'' said Dr. Torres-Saillant. ''So they come, they establish chapters, they do fund-raising here. They promise positions to Dominicans here.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Caraballo said, his party pushed hard for months to garner support in New York. The party's local branch conducted polls in New York to gauge support, raised $56,000 in two big-ticket fund-raisers and even helped pay for airfare so some Dominican supporters could go home to vote, he said. ''Every party does this kind of thing,'' Mr. Caraballo explained. ''No one sees anything wrong with it. They all do it.''</p>
        <p>Dominicans said yesterday that they felt compelled to have some say in politics in their country, whether through campaign contributions or by trying to sway their relatives back home. After all, they noted, Dominicans here maintain an important economic lifeline to the island, sending hundreds of millions of dollars to relatives.</p>
        <p>In casual conversations, many said they supported Hipolito Mejia of the center-left Dominican Revolutionary Party, who was leading in the polls but was not expected to receive enough votes to avoid a June 30 runoff against Mr. Balaguer or Danilo Medina of the governing Dominican Liberation Party.</p>
        <p>Not everyone sees the two-country political campaigns as a good thing. Fermin Luna, 63, producer of ''Nueva York de Noche,'' a cable-access program about Dominican issues, said he has long worried that Dominican politicians have exploited immigrants in New York, promising patronage jobs or vast improvements in the standard of living on an island long mired in poverty.</p>
        <p>''The Dominican lets himself be fooled by promises from politicians from there,'' said Mr. Luna, who came to the United States more than 30 years ago. ''I think to myself, 'Why are we so involved in the Dominican politics when this is where our children are growing up?' ''</p>
