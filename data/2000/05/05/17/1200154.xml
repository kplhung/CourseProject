        <p>A Manhattan judge yesterday threatened to handcuff Sante Kimes if she again tried to get in touch with  the news media. The jury in Mrs. Kimes's murder trial, meanwhile, did not reach a verdict after a second day of deliberations.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kimes and her son, Kenneth, have been charged with the murder of a missing Upper East Side widow. On Monday, Mrs. Kimes had a note passed to this reporter in which she claimed she had legally purchased Irene Silverman's town house, and said employees of the missing woman were responsible for her disappearance.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors have scoffed at such an explanation, pointing out that at the time of their arrest, the Kimeses had Mrs. Silverman's keys, Social Security card, passport and what the authorities contend is a forged deed turning the mansion over to the Kimeses for a fraction of its value.</p>
        <p>Justice Rena K. Uviller of State Supreme Court angrily chastised Mrs. Kimes yesterday for writing the note, calling it an overt attempt to influence the jury, and threatened to put her in handcuffs. Later in the day she curtly rejected a request from Mrs. Kimes that she be allowed to give interviews.</p>
        <p>''That application is denied,'' Justice Uviller said. ''This defendant's only purpose is to improperly affect this jury's deliberations.''</p>
        <p>The note and the threat were the latest confrontations between the judge and Mrs. Kimes. Two weeks ago, Mrs. Kimes telephoned The New York Times and other media outlets and said she was eager to be interviewed. After learning of the phone calls, Justice Uviller banned Mrs. Kimes from telephoning anyone but her lawyers. On Monday, Mrs. Kimes passed the note to the reporter.</p>
        <p>Courts have long upheld the right of judges to ban defendants from giving interviews during a trial because defendants in that way could make their views known to jurors without being subject to cross-examination. But Justice Uviller's ruling yesterday appeared to break new legal ground because it prevented Mrs. Kimes from contacting the media after the jury was sequestered.</p>
        <p>''I think that now that the jury is sequestered that Sante should be allowed to talk to whoever she wants,'' Michael Hardy, one of Mrs. Kimes's defense lawyers, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kimes had a chance to tell her story to the jury during the trial, but chose not to testify after Justice Uviller ruled that prosecutors could ask her about a 1986 conviction for enslaving a group of Mexicans.</p>
