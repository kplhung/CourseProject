        <p>The Toronto Blue Jays beat the visiting Boston Red Sox, 7-6, last night, stopping Boston's six-game winning streak.</p>
        <p>Boston maintained its one-game lead over the Yankees in the American League East and lost a game to the Blue Jays, who are in third place in the division, three games back.</p>
        <p>With Boston leading 6-4 in the ninth, Shannon Stewart singled off Derek Lowe (2-1) leading off. Jose Cruz doubled and Raul Mondesi tied it with a double off the wall in left-center field, just missing a home run.</p>
        <p>Carlos Delgado was intentionally walked, Brad Fullmer struck out and Mondesi stole third. Tony Batista then singled off the glove of second baseman Jose Offerman, capping Toronto's comeback from a 4-0 deficit.</p>
        <p>Mondesi, who went 2 for 5, came to the plate with the bases loaded twice, but popped out and hit into a forceout.</p>
        <p>Peter Munro (1-0) pitched the top of the ninth for his first major league victory, allowing one hit and striking out one. (AP)</p>
        <p>ROYALS 8, ATHLETICS 7: Jorge Fabregas, who tied the game with a run-scoring single in the seventh, hit a two-run single in the ninth as visiting Kansas City rallied from a four-run deficit to win at Oakland.</p>
        <p>Fabregas, who had three hits, pumped both fists after his decisive hit off Doug Jones (0-1).</p>
        <p>The winner was Dan Reichert (2-2), who allowed one unearned run in four innings of relief. Jerry Spradlin pitched the ninth for his second save despite allowing a run-scoring single to Jason Giambi.</p>
        <p>The Royals, who trailed by four runs in the first inning, gained a 6-6 tie in the seventh on a solo homer by Dave McCarty and the single by Fabregas.</p>
        <p>It was just the sixth victory for the Royals in 21 road games this season. Kansas City lost four of its previous five games over all. (AP)</p>
        <p>RANGERS 9, DEVIL RAYS 7: Ivan Rodriguez snapped a tie with a three-run double in the eighth inning, and he homered in his third straight game as Texas beat visiting Tampa Bay.</p>
        <p>Rodriguez drove in five runs and went 4-for-5, including a two-run homer that keyed a five-run first and tied him with Oakland's Jason Giambi for the major league lead with 16. (AP)</p>
        <p>INDIANS 11, TIGERS 9: Travis Fryman batted in four runs and Charles Nagy stayed around long enough to get his first victory since April 11 as Cleveland beat visiting Detroit in a steady rain.</p>
        <p>The Indians won for the fourth time in five games despite some dreadful pitching and a five-homer game by the Tigers, including two homers by Juan Gonzalez. (AP)</p>
        <p>ORIOLES 4, ANGELS 3: Scott Erickson won for the first time since elbow surgery, and Albert Belle and Mike Bordick homered as visiting Baltimore beat Anaheim to stop a seven-game losing streak.</p>
        <p>Erickson (1-1) allowed three runs and nine hits in seven innings in his third start since bone chips were removed from his right elbow on March 3. In his previous two outings, he allowed 12 earned runs in eight and two-thirds innings.</p>
        <p>Erickson improved to 16-4 against the Angels, becoming the first Orioles starter to win since Mike Mussina's complete game against Texas on April 29. (AP)</p>
        <p>MERCKER OUT OF INTENSIVE CARE: Pitcher Kent Mercker of the Anaheim Angels was transferred yesterday from intensive care to a private room at U.C.-Irvine Medical Center in Orange, Calif., where he is being treated for bleeding in his brain. (Bloomberg News)</p>
