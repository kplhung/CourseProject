        <p>Since the day 18 months ago when he announced he would not seek a fifth term in the United States Senate, Daniel Patrick Moynihan seemed to yield the spotlight, turning it over to newer names like Schumer and Clinton.</p>
        <p>But tonight, Mr. Moynihan was again at center stage as the state Democratic Party's convention paid homage to the man who has been a fixture in American politics for half a century as a scholar, adviser to American presidents, and member of Congress.</p>
        <p>To a hushed audience after a prolonged standing ovation, Mr. Moynihan, 73, looked back on a political career that began during the mayoral campaign of Robert F. Wagner Jr. in 1953. With his wife of 44 years, Elizabeth Brennan Moynihan, by his side, Mr. Moynihan briefly recalled his years in the Senate and his early days in New York politics.</p>
        <p>He spoke of his work in 1954 in the gubernatorial campaign of W. Averell Harriman, when he met his wife. He recalled that he was the first New Yorker in the 20th century to be chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.</p>
        <p>''For now, we say goodbye,'' Mr. Moynihan said. ''We thank our party and the people of this state for a great run.''</p>
        <p>Before Mr. Moynihan stepped to the lectern,  the audience was shown excerpts of his appearances on the NBC Television news program ''Meet the Press,'' beginning from his writings about black poverty in the 1960's and including his 1990's discussions of welfare reform and  verbal sparring with Senator Phil Gramm on taxes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moynihan reminisced about his time in the administrations of John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon and Gerald R. Ford. He affectionately recalled a Republican colleague, Jacob K. Javits.</p>
        <p>''These were not tranquil times,'' Mr. Moynihan said in a speech that lasted just five minutes. He talked of the threat of nuclear war that was ever present during his years in government. ''It could have happened any time. But it never did.''</p>
        <p>Not all of his remarks were reflective of days gone by. Mr. Moynihan also paid homage to Hillary Rodham Clinton, the woman who seeks to replace him in the Senate. After talking about the role that women in New York played in the last century to gain suffrage, Mr. Moynihan said, ''This year, for the first time in history, a first lady is going to be elected to the United States Senate.''</p>
        <p>Tribute was paid to Senator Moynihan in practically every speech, including those by Andrew Cuomo, secretary of housing and urban development, and Senator Charles E. Schumer.</p>
        <p>''Tonight, we begin to say our farewells to Senator Moynihan,'' said Judith Hope, the state Democratic Party chairwoman. ''Pat Moynihan is one of a kind. Always original. Always challenging the status quo, forever storming the barricades of closed minds, ever seeking the solutions to new problems that the rest of us haven't even perceived as problems.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Schumer offered similar praise, saying:  ''We will never forget you, Pat, your contribution to New York, the nation and to the world. We will always be proud to say, 'Pat Moynihan was my senator.' ''</p>
