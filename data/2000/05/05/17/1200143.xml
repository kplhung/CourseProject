        <p>Richard C. Holbrooke, just back from an extended peace mission in Africa, called today for a sweeping overhaul of the United Nations peacekeeping operations and for more money from member nations to make the operations effective.</p>
        <p>''Peacekeeping must be fixed in order to be saved,'' Mr. Holbrooke, the United States ambassador to the United Nations, said at a meeting on the organization's budget.</p>
        <p>The debate on the cost and future of United Nations peacekeeping opened at a critical moment. The United Nations is on the defensive for its performance under fire in Sierra Leone, and is and in the midst of a painful self-examination -- and some trading of accusations -- about what went wrong and why.</p>
        <p>United Nations peacekeeping is stretched almost beyond capacity, with substantial military and administrative operations in East Timor, Kosovo and Sierra Leone, where a renegade rebel, Foday Sankoh, and his Revolutionary United Front took about 500 peacekeepers hostage.</p>
        <p>A risky mission is about to be sent to Congo and, by July, the Security Council will be faced with a call for a large force on the Lebanese-Israeli border to move in after the withdrawal of Israeli troops.</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Holbrooke recommended expanding the peacekeeping department significantly and allowing Secretary General Kofi Annan more flexibility in staffing it. That matter is a constant battle here, where staff allocations of all kinds are micromanaged by the General Assembly.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holbrooke also asked countries that have been given discounts on peacekeeping bills for more than a quarter of a century to offer to pay more as their economies grow. All the organization's member states pay a proportion of the total peacekeeping costs.</p>
        <p>For the first time, five nations answered the appeal and said they would pay more: Cyprus, Estonia, Israel, Hungary and the Philippines. Mr. Holbrooke said in an interview that he hoped to see at least four or five more on the list.</p>
        <p>In his speech, Mr. Holbrooke announced that a high-level review over how to contribute better to peacekeeping was under way in the Clinton Administration, which many diplomats and officials here say badly let down the United Nations in Sierra Leone. Mr. Holbrooke backed the establishment of a rapid-deployment unit at United Nations headquarters to work with a roster of available military, police and civilian experts to be called on as needed.</p>
        <p>Most diplomats here, stung by humiliation in Sierra Leone, would not fault the conclusion that peacekeeping needs to be rethought.</p>
        <p>But not all are happy to let the United States take the lead, saying that decisions in Washington, including a vote by Congress to lower American peacekeeping assessments in violation of international agreements, have caused much of the problem.</p>
        <p>Ambassador Michael Powles of New Zealand, speaking today for his country as well as Australia and Canada, told the budget assembly that ''some countries have been presenting the problems associated with peacekeeping financing as if they were solely the making of the United Nations and attributable to the fact that the peacekeeping scale has not been revised since it was created in 1973.''</p>
        <p>''This is not the whole story,'' he said, making a direct reference to the United States position. He blamed debt defaulters instead. The United States owes more than $1 billion.</p>
        <p>In Sierra Leone, attacks on peacekeepers began when they were being deployed in rebel strongholds, especially diamond-mining areas. The attacks and abductions changed the character of the United Nations operation overnight.</p>
        <p>What happened in Sierra Leone provokes debate -- and some name-calling -- at several levels.</p>
        <p>On the ground in Freetown, the United Nations has had problems with both its military commander, Maj. Gen. Vijay Kumar Jetley of India, and the Secretary General's special envoy, Oluyemi Adeniji, a retired Nigerian diplomat.</p>
        <p>General Jetley, who has commanded the peacekeeping force since it was sent to Sierra Leone, is popular with civilian United Nations officials there, and his Indian troops when fully deployed will make up a third of the total force. A second contingent of Indian troops began to  arrive today, with a full battalion of 1,000 soldiers expected in the next few days. The reinforcement raises the United Nations peacekeeping force to 9,150 members.</p>
        <p>General Jetley has been criticized by leaders of several contingents from other nations taking part in the peacekeeping mission, among them the Zambians and Kenyans. They describe him as high-handed and uncooperative, and there are serious discussions about replacing him, some officials say.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adeniji has also created problems by running his own show without keeping officials, including Mr.  Annan, informed. Little useful analysis of what was happening in rebel-held areas was ever collected or forwarded to New York, officials complain, although relief organizations say they knew a great deal.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, Mr. Adeniji went to Monrovia, Liberia, to negotiate with President Charles Taylor for the release of more than 130 hostages, since the Liberian president continues to influence at least a part of Mr. Sankoh's rebel force, the Revolutionary United Front. But he did not tell Mr. Annan or other officials here of his freelance mission. United Nations headquarters found out through an African-based journalist who got a tip about a hostage release.</p>
        <p>Replacing either man, however, would not be easy. India has already taken umbrage at official criticism of its commander, and has threatened to abandon the mission.</p>
        <p>Nigeria, which had its own forces in Sierra Leone under a West African regional operation before pulling most of them in recent weeks, appears to have an interest in having a free hand in the affairs of Sierra Leone. The Nigerians had put pressure on the Secretary General to name a Nigerian as special representative.</p>
        <p>A more fundamental problem for the United Nations is that it was never party to the Lome agreement last year that created the now-sabotaged peace deal in Sierra Leone.</p>
        <p>''In the Lome agreement the U.N. were not supposed to be the peacekeeping force,'' said Bernard Miyet, the undersecretary general for peacekeeping, who briefed the Security Council on Monday after returning from Sierra Leone. ''We were supposed at the beginning to have a few dozen military observers.''</p>
        <p>--------------------</p>
        <p>U.S. Team in Sierra Leone</p>
        <p>WASHINGTON, May 16 -- Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen said that an Air Force team arrived in Sierra Leone today to assess the security of the airport outside the capital, Freetown.</p>
        <p>Mr. Annan has criticized Washington for refusing to send American peacekeepers into Sierra Leone. But Mr. Cohen said the United States is continuing to work with Nigeria to figure out how to help that country if it sends in peacekeepers.</p>
        <p>''We have in fact been in contact with the Nigerians to see how and if they can participate in a very active role and what will be required to support their efforts,'' Mr. Cohen said today at a Pentagon briefing.</p>
        <p>The United States may provide some equipment to the Nigerians, as well as transportation, according to Kenneth Bacon, the Pentagon spokesman.</p>
        <p>''The problem isn't people willing to be part of the United Nations or regional forces,'' Mr. Bacon said. ''The issue is to get them to be effective.''</p>
