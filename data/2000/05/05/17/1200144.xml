        <p>The Clinton administration's campaign to win permanent normal trading privileges for China took another step forward today as two influential Democrats endorsed the measure on the eve of an important committee vote.</p>
        <p>Representative Charles B. Rangel of New York, the ranking Democrat of the Ways and Means Committee, said he would support the measure when a sharply divided House votes on the legislation next week.</p>
        <p>Another Democrat on the panel, Xavier Becerra of California, also threw his support behind the bill today, and Mr. Rangel predicted that a ''solid majority'' of the committee's 16 Democrats would back it when the panel meets on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>''From a high-tech point of view, an agriculture point of view, a goods-and-services point of view, a great deal of them have no choice except to support allowing America access to these markets,'' Mr. Rangel told reporters.</p>
        <p>The Senate Finance Committee is also expected to approve the legislation, giving the overall measure a lift, but passage in the Senate is considered virtually certain.</p>
        <p>Representative David Dreier of California, a top Republican vote counter for the bill, hailed Mr. Rangel's endorsement, which could sway two or three undecided Democrats later this week.</p>
        <p>Opponents prepared to wheel out on Wednesday a battery of veterans' groups that say the agreement would reward a Communist government that poses a military threat to its neighbors and to America's national security. Critics have also zeroed in on China's record on human rights and labor standards as reasons that Congress should not give up its annual review of China's trading status, in exchange for the permanent lower tariffs that the United States grants almost all other countries.</p>
        <p>As the lobbying intensified on a dwindling number of uncommitted legislators, both camps said the House vote, expected in the middle of next week, was too close to call. The measure needs 218 votes to win.</p>
        <p>''They don't have the votes, but neither do we,'' said Representative Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California and a chief critic of the measure.</p>
        <p>President Clinton continued to lobby for the bill, inviting some undecided Democrats to travel with him on Air Force One to Albany, where his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, was to be nominated tonight as the party's Senate candidate from New York.</p>
