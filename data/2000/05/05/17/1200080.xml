        <p>Peter Martins's production of ''The Sleeping Beauty'' for the New York City Ballet has a fairy-tale splendor. Happily, this staging, which continues throughout the week at the New York State Theater, does not depend only on the ballerina in the title role.</p>
        <p>It was a joy nonetheless to see Jenifer Ringer triumph as a new, radiant Princess Aurora on Sunday afternoon, and it was a pleasure at another performance to note how impressively Wendy Whelan has grown into the same role since her debut several years ago.</p>
        <p>This year the tempos are not as extremely fast as in the past, allowing the dancing to be more sharply impressed on the eye. The original 19th-century choreography by Marius Petipa has been preserved in the set pieces, with occasional revisions in the fairies' solos and the ensembles by Mr. Martins. George Balanchine's choreography for the Garland Dance at Aurora's birthday continues to dazzle with its spectacular patterns.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ringer is a natural Aurora, technically secure while exuding the freshness of youth and promise in Act I. Her first solo began with a light spring and precise sparkle, while her major solo was enhanced by the shoulder work, or epaulement, that gave her dancing a lyrical flow. In between, the famous Rose Adagio with four cavaliers built grandly into the right brilliant climax.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ringer caught the essence of the part: a young girl struck down by an evil fairy but awakened to womanhood after a hundred-year nap by a prince with whom she danced a grand pas de deux. In Act IV, her manner was regal, carefully phrased and in deep rapport with Philip Neal as a perfect prince. Atypically off in his double air-turns, he had impressed with the thrust of his passionate dancing in the solo choreographed by Mr. Martins in Act II. The vision scene here was as dramatic as ever, with Ms. Ringer slightly heavier than expected in her dancing but an ideal to be pursued nevertheless.</p>
        <p>New to other roles were Jennie Somogyi, as perfect a Lilac Fairy as one has seen (gracious but firm and giving the choreography full value) and Jenny Blascovich, who made Carabosse, the wicked fairy, more than something that rhymes with witch: her mime had wit and sass.</p>
        <p>The all-important Bluebird Pas de Deux at the wedding received outstanding polish from Adam Hendrickson, good in all his leg beats, and Abi Stafford, the amazing 17-year-old who joined the company last winter and appeared in leading roles two weeks later.</p>
        <p>A prodigy in the wings is Daniel Ulbricht, a student at the School of American Ballet, whose high jumps were matched by his precise style in a gestures' trio. (Antonio Carmena and Craig Hall held their own.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Stafford's quicksilver dynamics were noticeable in the Prologue as the second fairy. Deanna McBrearty moved with clarity in the third solo as did Elena Diner in the fourth, while Pauline Golbin and Aesha Ash, in the first and fifth solos, did well enough.</p>
        <p>The child dancer in the Red Riding Hood sequence was Saige Miller. On Thursday it was Ksenia Pereverzeva. Both were fine little actresses and kept up marvelously with the adult choreography in the mazurka. On Thursday Ms. Whelan's Aurora and Damian Woetzel's temperamental and exciting prince brought the fairy tale to an authoritative end. Ms. Whelan's first act needs more charm: she has the sparkle but softer arms would bring her dancing into a more harmonious image.</p>
        <p>Helene Alexopoulos's glamorous Carabosse was rightly the Queen of Mean, and Kathleen Tracey's Lilac Fairy had a well-scrubbed look that went with this streamlined staging. The Jewels divertissement had a new and efficient cast: Arch Higgins, Maria Kawroski, Rachel Rutherford and Carrie Lee Riggins. Samantha Allen and Tom Gold gave the Bluebird pas de deux a small-scale polish.</p>
        <p>Debuts had also taken place in the mixed repertory season. Janie Taylor's toe work was somewhat insecure in the second movement of Balanchine's ''Western Symphony'' on May 6. But Ms. Rutherford clearly relished the role of the dance hall girl she performed so well in the first section. Jerome Robbins's ''In the Night'' showed little of its old impact with a partly new cast: Yvonne Borree with Robert Tewsley, Ms. Somogyi with Peter Boal, Ms. Ringer and James Fayette.</p>
