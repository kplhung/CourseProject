        <p>Republican supporters of George W. Bush for the presidency take his word for it that he's the ''compassionate'' one, deserving to lead our country. But if he has such a human heart that he can ''suffer with'' others (as compassion means), why is he not doing something about the rush to kill in the execution chambers of his state?</p>

        <p>Re ''Bush Candidacy Puts Focus on Executions'' (front page, May 14):</p>
        <p>Republican supporters of George W. Bush for the presidency take his word for it that he's the ''compassionate'' one, deserving to lead our country. But if he has such a human heart that he can ''suffer with'' others (as compassion means), why is he not doing something about the rush to kill in the execution chambers of his state?</p>
        <p>I had to learn what compassion really means when my son and his wife were murdered -- shot to death in their bed by an intruder, an 18-year-old in Montana in August 1993.  That's when the death penalty was no longer an academic question but a gut-level torment.</p>
        <p>I don't know how this teenager got a gun or what turned him into a killer, but in the end his act didn't get me to devalue life. Life became more important to me than ever, convincing me we've got to stop our death row madness.</p>
