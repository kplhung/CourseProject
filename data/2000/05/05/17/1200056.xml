        <p>MARIO ANDRETTI won't give an exact number. When pressed, the race-car-driving legend will reluctantly admit that on some deserted roads, he has driven his bright yellow Lamborghini Diablo nearly three times as fast as the posted speed limit.</p>
        <p>Of course, Mr. Andretti, who has driven more than 250 miles per hour on a Michigan racetrack and has won the Daytona 500, Indianapolis 500 and dozens of other races, is no ordinary driver. Nor can his Lamborghini, which can reach 208 m.p.h., be considered an ordinary car.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Andretti, who lives in Nazareth, Pa., is no different from millions of other drivers: he likes to go fast on the highway. And if he breaks the law? ''I speed when it's clear,'' he said, ''and I know what I'm doing. Responsible speeding is not dangerous.''</p>
        <p>Others disagree. But analyzing the risks of speeding through statistics is inconclusive. For example, the latest data suggests that despite hikes in speed limits by most states over the last five years, American drivers are safer even though they are driving faster. The traffic fatality rate is at a record low. That fact is being used by some groups to argue that speed limits should be raised. Insurance and safety groups argue, however, that the fatality rate would be even lower if fewer people violated the law.</p>
        <p>All that speeding comes with a price tag. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that speeding-related accidents cost nearly $29 billion a year, and that speeding has been a factor in nearly a third of all fatal crashes.</p>
        <p>Defenders of speeding -- and there are many (Web sites like speedtrap.com have information on how to avoid well-known traps) -- insist that it is not dangerous. But the laws of physics apply to speeders and nonspeeders alike. The amount of energy exerted on a car that crashes while going 75 m.p.h. is 86 percent higher than if the same car crashed traveling 55 m.p.h.</p>
        <p>Despite the dangers of speeding, speed-limit laws are an impediment to the American dream. While most drivers would never break a store window for the thrill of it, those same drivers think nothing of breaking speed limits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Andretti's definition of danger is likely to be different from that of a soccer mom in Tulsa, Okla. Therein lies the problem: drivers decide for themselves which speed is risky.</p>
        <p>Leon James, a psychology professor at the University of Hawaii who has studied American driving habits for 19 years, estimates that 90 percent of drivers exceed posted speed limits.</p>
        <p>Driving is tied to the emotions. ''If someone passes us, it's like a personal insult,'' Dr. James said. The constant urge to beat other cars, combined with busier schedules, a distrust of government and the belief that no harm is being done leads people to put the pedal to the metal. ''You drive at a speed at which you feel safe regardless of the speed limit,'' he added.</p>
        <p>Even with today's higher driving speeds, car travel in America is safer than ever. Last year, the traffic fatality rate -- which peaked in 1910, when there were only 469,000 cars on the roads -- continued its nearly century-long decline and dropped to its lowest level ever, 1.5 deaths per 100 million vehicle miles traveled.</p>
        <p>THE rate has fallen because of safety improvements like air bags, better suspensions and lighting systems and mandatory seat-belt laws. There has also been a substantial decrease in alcohol abuse by drivers. From 1985 to 1995, the number of fatal crashes involving drunken drivers dropped 25 percent.</p>
        <p>Better emergency medical care, including better-equipped ambulances and helicopters, saves the lives of drivers who, in the past, would have died from their injuries. A final, seldom discussed factor is that people have fewer chances to get hurt because there are too many other cars on the road. Drivers in Massachusetts, which has the lowest fatality rate in the country, are not necessarily more skilled than drivers elsewhere. The fatality rate is low probably because Massachusetts drivers are often stuck in traffic, particularly in the Boston area. They simply cannot go fast enough to get in a nasty wreck.</p>
        <p>''Congestion is a friend of highway safety,'' said Chuck Hurley, the executive director of the Highway Safety Group of the National Safety Council. He pointed out that the traffic-rich states of the Northeast have consistently lower fatality rates than in the West. Since 1995, Texans have been allowed to drive 70 m.p.h. on rural highways. But  many Texans view that as a starting point.</p>
        <p>Given the pandemic of speeding, getting  drivers to slow down may be a losing battle. Professor James says that the simplest solution is to encourage drivers to leave home earlier. It's a good idea. But for Mr. Andretti and drivers like him, it seems that the only good speed limit is a broken one.</p>
