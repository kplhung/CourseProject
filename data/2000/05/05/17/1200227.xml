        <p>The Philadelphia Flyers' No. 1 center, Eric Lindros, is out indefinitely with a series of career-threatening concussions. Their No. 2 center, Keith Primeau, started a first-period fistfight tonight with Randy McKay exactly a week after suffering a concussion himself against the Penguins. Philadelphia's No. 3 center, Daymond Langkow, is going to be tested for a concussion Wednesday morning after absorbing a vicious open-ice hit by Scott Stevens in the third period. Undaunted, it was the Flyers' 36-year-old right wing who dazed the Devils tonight, 4-3, in one of the fiercest playoff games in recent memory.</p>
        <p>The Flyers came back from a 3-1 deficit late in the second period because of Rick Tocchet, who scored two goals -- including the tying one that turned the game around early in the third period -- and assisted on one other.</p>
        <p>Tocchet was originally thought to have scored the winning goal, which would have given him his first playoff hat trick.</p>
        <p>''I knew I didn't score,'' Tocchet said, referring to the goal by Langkow at 1 minute 58 seconds of the third period. ''It's a good thing they never announced it. It got the fans going. And I don't think they care now.'' It took five minutes for the ice to be cleared of caps.</p>
        <p>Langkow was finally credited with the winning goal 52 seconds later after Tocchet bowled over -- ''cross-checked,'' he later admitted -- Colin White into Martin Brodeur as the rebound of Langkow's shot from the left point trickled into the goal.</p>
        <p>Just 39 seconds later, Langkow was headed for the training room, thanks to Stevens. There was some grumbling in the Flyers' dressing room about Stevens's hit to the head because it opened a cut over Langkow's right eye that required 15 stitches to close.</p>
        <p>But, as Primeau later said, ''We knew it was going to get ugly before it was over.'' He was referring to the series. He could have been referring to the Flyers' season, as well.</p>
        <p>Eric Desjardins, the 30-year-old defenseman who succeeded Lindros as captain, began the Flyers' rally when he scored with 38.8 seconds left in the second period to cut the deficit to 3-2. Lindros rejoined the Flyers here today from his Toronto home, but only to work out on his own, away from the team.</p>
        <p>During the first intermission, Lindros said he did not want to be a distraction to his teammates. Unfortunately for Lindros, he has often been just that for most of his National Hockey League career, never more so than this season.</p>
        <p>But the addition of Lindros could also provide the Flyers with a big boost as they try to come back and take the series. The earliest that Lindros could be cleared to play is Game 6, if necessary, on May 24. And the Flyers did their best here tonight to give Lindros the chance to come back and play.</p>
        <p>''I feel really good,'' Lindros said, after completing his two-a-day workout of a half-hour skate, two separate bike rides and a session of lifting weights. Lindros has not played since March 13, nine days after he suffered the fourth of his five career concussions over the last two years.</p>
        <p>''This is the best I've felt in a long time,'' he said. ''I'm looking forward to getting back in action.''</p>
        <p>There are plenty of people who question that attitude. There were plenty more tonight questioning the sanity of Primeau goading McKay into a fight. Boxers are usually required to take at least a month off after being knocked out before being relicensed to fight. Primeau was back at it after seven days. Later, he was asked what he was thinking.</p>
        <p>''I guess I'm not,'' Primeau said.</p>
        <p>He had nothing but praise for McKay fighting him, when all he wanted was to get at Bobby Holik.</p>
        <p>Primeau shook off a Holik hit along the end boards to feed Tocchet for the tying goal, 1:06 into the third.</p>
        <p>''You don't like to see Keith Primeau fighting,'' the Flyers' interim coach, Craig Ramsay, said. ''But he felt it was time, and I certainly wouldn't challenge him on that.''</p>
        <p>A neurologist might. Both Lindros and Primeau were using the same rationale about why, after sustaining concussions, they have done all they can to come back and play.</p>
        <p>Both have been to the conference finals. Both have been to the Stanley Cup finals once. Neither has won the cup. ''I just don't want to miss it,'' Primeau said.</p>
        <p>Funny, Lindros had said the same a couple of hours before the Flyers' stirring victory.</p>
