        <p>''NICE car,'' said a man in a black T-shirt, walking past the little European sedan at a conference here last month on transportation and the environment. ''Is it yours?''</p>
        <p>It was the sort of comment that usually stokes the male ego. But Conrad Wagner, the 40-year-old Swiss entrepreneur who was standing beside the car, was not stoked. He rolled his eyes in exasperation and launched into a little discourse.</p>
        <p>''No, it's not mine,'' said Mr. Wagner, who started the world's first successful car-sharing program in 1987, in Lucerne. ''Owning a big piece of metal -- that is Iron Age. It is much better for the environment -- it is much more cool, you know -- to rely on a number of transportation modalities: the bus, the train, a fleet of shared cars.''</p>
        <p>The guy in the T-shirt walked away unconvinced. But throughout Europe and Canada, and in small green-minded enclaves in the United States, people are beginning to buy Mr. Wagner's idea.</p>
        <p>Four American cities -- Portland, Seattle, Boston and Traverse City, Mich. -- now have programs inspired by Mr. Wagner's Mobility CarSharing Switzerland, which has 1,600 vehicles available for sharing in hundreds of places throughout the country. These businesses are essentially short-term car-rental agencies with a public purpose:  reducing car ownership and, by extension, fuel use and pollution.</p>
        <p>The companies park their cars in residential neighborhoods, so that they can be used -- and returned to their designated parking slots -- by members, who usually pay annual dues plus hourly and mileage fees. Each car must be reserved.</p>
        <p>Boston and three smaller American cities also have a variant known as station cars, in which small electric vehicles are parked at rail stations. Commuters take the train to the station, then hop into a station car, drive it to their workplace and park there; the car is then available for participants returning to the rail station, and the reservation system assures that the first driver will find a car to take back to the station.</p>
        <p>While Seattle's car-sharing program, Flexcar, is considered the nation's most ambitious, the soul of American car sharing lies here in Portland, a vast city whose four-lane thoroughfares and serpentine residential streets were built for the auto, but which has lately become preoccupied with anti-sprawl planning and green living.</p>
        <p>In 1998, David Brook, a home-energy-conservation specialist, opened a car-sharing enterprise here, down the street from People's Food Co-op. His business, CarSharing Portland, now has 17 vehicles, mostly Dodge Neon sedans; the cars are shared by 275 drivers, who pay dues of $100 a year, plus $1.50 an hour and 40 cents a mile.</p>
        <p>Members tend to be young professionals who don't need a car to get to work. Kassim Ferris, a 31-year-old patent lawyer who bikes to his office, said that he uses the service only three or four times a month, when he needs to ''pick up dry cleaning, say, or drive to a concert that's far away.''</p>
        <p>Xander Patterson, a CarSharing member who is the co-chairman of the Pacific Green Party, also drives as little as he can. ''Usually,'' he said, ''I tow my golf clubs to the course in a cart attached to my bicycle.''</p>
        <p>But not all CarSharing members spurn the auto. Some are couples who use shared cars rather than buy a second car, and some are frequent drivers who don't own a car.</p>
        <p>Bud Erland and Lisa Morrison, who are married, use the white Neon parked two blocks from their home about three times a week -- to carry groceries and garden supplies, and to shuttle their 7-year-old son, John, to Little League. When Mr. Erland's mother died last month, they rode to the funeral in a shared car. ''We don't have to hassle with car ownership,'' said Ms. Morrison, a hospital worker. ''We don't have to think, 'Where can we park it? Is the car being broken into?' ''</p>
        <p>It does not necessarily save them money. Mr. Erland, a meticulous recordkeeper, calculated that car sharing cost them $2,268 for 2,965 miles driven last year -- 76 cents a mile. When they owned a 1970 Volvo station wagon, they spent an average of $2,620 a year, which included gas, maintenance, repairs, depreciation and insurance, and drove an average of 9,755 miles -- 27 cents a mile.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Erland, a city bus driver, said that not owning a car ''feels right -- even if, economically, it proves that we're fools.'' And it has certainly kept their total mileage down. ''We didn't have a car out in the driveway,'' he said with pride. ''So, yeah, we didn't drive as much. We didn't, say, pop out to the grocery store for a quart of milk.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brook, CarSharing's president, said that is just the point. ''I don't want to make car use too easy for people,'' he said. ''If you make driving a little less attractive, people will walk; they'll take the bus.'' He cited a Swiss study indicating that after people joined CarSharing, their total fuel consumption decreased 55 percent.</p>
        <p>Some experts doubt that car sharing will catch on in the United States. Kenneth Orski, editor of Innovation Briefs, a Washington newsletter focused on transportation, said it was far more suitable for Western Europe. ''In the crowded, medieval cities there,'' he said, ''it's very hard to park a car; gas is extremely expensive. In the United States, though, gas is cheap and everything is spread out. People want to drive; they want to own a car.''</p>
        <p>The urge is profound even in the greenest of Portland homes. On a recent evening, as Lisa Morrison was washing the Earth Day mug in which she had just served chamomile tea, 7-year-old John Erland spoke up.</p>
        <p>''Ever since I saw this ad on TV,'' he said, ''I've been wanting a car -- a Chevy minivan with a TV right inside! I want one of those cars, real bad.''</p>
