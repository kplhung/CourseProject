        <p>During his post-practice news conference today, Coach Pat Riley was asked how the Heat might make Miami fans out of some of the transplanted New Yorkers in South Florida who root loudly for the Knicks.</p>
        <p>Riley, in what was clearly an attempt to be funny, said that the Heat should use a ''Gestapo group'' to get the fans to change allegiances.</p>
        <p>At the time he made the remark, in front of a group of reporters, Riley was not asked about his use of the word ''Gestapo,'' which was the secret police force of the German Nazi state, and whether he realized that many would be offended by the remark, and that many of the transplanted New Yorkers he was referring to are Jewish, as is the Heat owner Micky Arison.</p>
        <p>Asked tonight about the remark, Riley, at first, was both apologetic and a little bit angry.</p>
        <p>''If anybody sitting in that little audience of press people today didn't think I was saying that in jest, didn't think I was saying that with a little bit of humor, because the question was posed to me about how do we get New York fans to become Heat fans, well, you know what, to hell with them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Then they can't take a joke, then they can't laugh at themselves. And if they want to make this into any more than what was intended, then they can make it into more than it was intended.''</p>
        <p>He said the remark ''was said purely in context of the question that was asked of me and I tried to be as lighthearted as I could with it, but I am not Bill Maher. I'm not that good.''</p>
        <p>Maher is the host of ''Politically Incorrect,'' a humor-laced news show on ABC television.</p>
        <p>Riley said he could have used a different term than Gestapo in discussing South Florida Knick fans.</p>
        <p>''Maybe we'll get the Mounted Police then, O.K.?,'' he said. ''Or we'll get the Heat Transformation Girl Dancers to try to transform them. If I used the wrong word there, it was never used in the context of anything that happened 50 years ago. People have to be a little more open-minded than that.''</p>
        <p>Later tonight, Riley issued a more formal apology, in which he said: ''It has come to my attention that in answering a question I may have unintentionally offended some people with the answer. For that, I sincerely apologize.''</p>
