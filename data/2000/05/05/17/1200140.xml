        <p>No, notwithstanding a joke making the rounds here, Seattle has not changed its name to Allentown. Not yet, anyway.</p>
        <p>But from one end of downtown to the other, from a fantastically curvy and psychedelic rock 'n' roll museum, designed by Frank O. Gehry and opening next month at the base of the Space Needle, to the recent implosion of the Kingdome and plans for its replacement with a $450 million outdoor football stadium, the landscape of Seattle is undergoing a remarkable transformation bankrolled largely by one man.</p>
        <p>He is Paul G. Allen, who bounces around from being the second- to the fourth-richest person on the planet, depending on the fortunes of the stock of the Microsoft Corporation, which he co-founded 25 years ago with a middle-school chum, William H. Gates.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Gates continues to do battle from the company's helm against software competitors (and federal antitrust lawyers), Mr. Allen, who resigned from Microsoft management in 1983, has a far more diversified palette of activities. And many combine longtime passions of his -- sports, movies, futuristic designs and the music of Jimi Hendrix, the late guitarist and Seattle native whom Mr. Allen has enshrined in an entire gallery at the new museum -- with real estate projects that are remaking the face of the city.</p>
        <p>Seattle of course abounds these days with cyberbillionaires who are making a huge imprint on the virtual world and, to a lesser extent, on the real world of their hometown. But none of the others come close to affecting the visual appearance of Seattle in the same way as the 47-year-old Mr. Allen, whose net worth is currently around $30 billion, who owns the Seattle Seahawks of the National Football League and the Portland Trail Blazers of the National Basketball Association, who has major investments in more than 100 ''new media'' companies and who even plays rhythm guitar in a Seattle band, Grown Men, that recently released its first CD and, on its Web site, describes its music as being inspired by Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Tom Petty and the Eagles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Allen's real estate projects are so eclectic and so broadly spread around the city that Jeffrey K. Ochsner, chairman of the department of architecture at the University of Washington, describes him as ''kind of a modern equivalent to the Medici in Florence,'' a man who is building a coliseum as well as a new techno-palace of glass-walled headquarters in south downtown. Others here compare him to Baron Haussmann, the creator of modern Paris.</p>
        <p>Intriguingly, though, Mr. Allen seems to have generated less controversy than a bit of civic head-scratching as to whether his projects all add up to a grand plan.</p>
        <p>''As far as having an 800-pound gorilla running around your city, he's a pretty amiable one,'' said Alex Steffen, president of Allied Arts of Seattle, an urban planning and arts advocacy group. ''I mean, it's hard to be too outraged by someone who just loves sports and is kind of geeky in his devotion to Jimi Hendrix.</p>
        <p>''But at the same time, you look at somebody with that much sheer power, that much of an awesome ability to shape the landscape of the city you live in, and you want something a bit more visionary. I don't have any sense that he's looking at a map of the city and saying, 'What can I do to make Seattle a better place?' I get the sense that he's got all these holdings and all this money, and he's looking at the map and saying, 'What could I do there that would be a lot of fun?' ''</p>
        <p>Naturally, Mr. Allen said in an interview, he wants to make Seattle a better place. But he seemed to bristle at the notion that he should have an overarching design vision.</p>
        <p>''There are threads that run through these things, but there's no singular master plan,'' he said.  ''There's the desire to be fresh, to incorporate high technology, to do things in high-quality ways. What we're doing downtown kind of reflects the breadth of my interests in all these different areas, all the way from music to sports to high tech to movies and so forth.''</p>
        <p>But even if Mr. Allen's central aim were only to find ways to make the city more fun, many people here say, that would be a great idea.</p>
        <p>The new music museum, the Experience Music Project, known as E.M.P., is undeniably fun on the inside: an interactive paean to modern American music, including rock, jazz, soul, gospel, country, blues, grunge, hip-hop and other forms to come. Sound studios allow visitors to play their own music, or to strum a guitar that lights the sequence of chords to play ''Louie Louie,'' a song whose lyrics led to an F.B.I. investigative file that is one of 80,000 artifacts collected for the museum.</p>
        <p>Outside is another matter. ''Make it swoopy'' were the instructions Mr. Allen offered when he hired Mr. Gehry as architect for the project. The $250 million museum has an undulating aluminum and stainless-steel shell of gold, silver, red, blue and iridescent purple, with wires stretched across the top, all intended to evoke the image of a smashed guitar. The Seattle Center monorail runs right through it.</p>
        <p>E.M.P., set to open on June 23, is a powerful sight that attracts the eye from all kinds of Seattle vantage points, and it has quickly become the most talked-about work of architecture in town. It has its proponents, including some who believe it represents a bit of Bilbao on Elliott Bay, harking back to Mr. Gehry's much-celebrated Guggenheim Museum in that Spanish city.</p>
        <p>But it has its share of detractors, too. ''Open-heart surgery gone awry'' was among the less than flattering images summoned up in a survey several months ago by The Seattle Post-Intelligencer, which found sentiment running about 3 to 1 against the design.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gehry himself, in town this week for a sold-out appearance at the Seattle Arts and Lectures speakers' series, seemed amused by all the talk about his new building.</p>
        <p>''I have an unusual client,'' the 71-year-old architect explained during a walking tour of the museum's exterior on Monday. Mr. Allen, he said, ''really asked me to push it -- to take it to the moon, so to speak.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Allen, for his part, said he was thrilled. ''It's kind of rock 'n' roll architecture,'' he said. ''It's expressive and unabashed and fresh and exciting. You're not going to see too many 120-foot-high purple metallic structures. You're just not. Even if you don't appreciate the particular design, you have to appreciate the exuberance and the audacity and all that. To me, it's breathtaking.''</p>
        <p>Fans of the museum say it will in time become a Seattle landmark, perhaps even an internationally recognizable symbol of the city like the Space Needle, which was built for the 1962 World's Fair. Others say that's a stretch.</p>
        <p>''Look at the difference between what those two monuments say,'' said Mr. Steffen, of Allied Arts. ''The Space Needle says World's Fair, an ambitious society yearning for this amazing future, when energy would be too cheap to meter and we'd all be flying around in rocket cars.</p>
        <p>''What will this museum say? It'll say, yeah, we once had a guy who picked a wacky architect and really liked Jimi Hendrix. It's not even in the same league, though I suppose it may eventually be seen as a reflection of an era when money was too cheap to meter.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Allen's influence is certainly felt elsewhere as well. One project, 505 Union Station, is a striking new 11-story building, designed with a cascading ''glass waterfall,'' that will anchor more than a million square feet of office, retail and hotel space in several buildings nearby.  The project will provide headquarters for Vulcan Northwest Inc., the umbrella company that oversees many of Mr. Allen's endeavors and is currently based in Bellevue, across Lake Washington.</p>
        <p>In addition, the project will involve renovation of the 90-year-old Union Station, which will be used as a transportation hub for Sound Transit, the public agency that is trying to knit together a commuter-rail, light-rail and express-bus system of nearly $4 billion to ease the region's chronic traffic problems.</p>
        <p>Mr. Allen also bought and renovated, in an early-60's retro style, the 827-seat Cinerama Theater, which he loved attending as a boy. He donated $10 million to the University of Washington for a library building named for his late father, Kenneth, who was the university's associate librarian. On the other side of the state, he even built a $3.1 million, ultrawired house for the fraternity he belonged to at Washington State University.</p>
        <p>Mr. Allen dropped out of Washington State as a young man and went to live for a while in Boston, where he met up with a younger friend from Lakeside School here, Mr. Gates, who soon dropped out of Harvard. They founded Microsoft in 1975.</p>
        <p>In 1982, while still at Microsoft, Mr. Allen discovered lumps in his neck and was found to have Hodgkin's disease. He fought off the illness with months of radiation therapy and eventually left Microsoft, though he has remained friendly with Mr. Gates through the years and sits on the company's board. He owns about 215 million shares in Microsoft,  roughly 4.1 percent of the company's stock outstanding, Vulcan Northwest officials say.</p>
        <p>Mr. Allen did not say whether he had any other major projects to announce, but his spokeswoman, Susan Pierson Brown, said that all his building ventures met some basic criteria.</p>
        <p>''Each one is appropriate for its purpose, for its subject matter and for its neighborhood: we wouldn't put a Frank Gehry building out near Costco in Issaquah,'' she said of the big store in the Seattle suburbs, ''and we wouldn't put a rock 'n' roll museum in a square box.''</p>
