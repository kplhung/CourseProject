        <p>Cherie Blair, the prominent London lawyer who is the wife of Prime Minister Tony Blair, went to court today to win an argument against his government that she has not fully won against him at home.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Blair, 45, who is days away from giving birth to their fourth child, appeared as chief counsel for the Trades Union Congress in a High Court challenge over the way the government has introduced parental leave regulations into British law.</p>
        <p>Under the new rules, adopted from a European Union directive, parents can take up to 13 weeks of unpaid leave in the first five years of their child's life. But the British version restricts the benefit to parents whose children were born or adopted after Dec. 15, 1999, thus excluding, according to the unions, 2.7 million mothers and fathers of children now under 5.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Blair practices law under her professional name, Cherie Booth, and carries the Q.C. suffix connoting her high-ranking status as a queen's counsel. A specialist in employment law and the first spouse of a British prime minister to hold a full-time job, she has always made it clear that she is professionally independent and feels free to take on her husband's government. It was she who told the union group that they should bring today's action.</p>
        <p>She appeared in the Gothic pile housing the High Court in her black silk robes and curly white wig with three junior counsel at her side in what the court said was to ''cater for any eventuality.''</p>
        <p>She made a wry reference to her own heavily pregnant state when she noted that the parental rights directive, introduced in most of Europe in 1996 and debated for a decade before that, had ''a very long gestation period, which is something I am beginning to think is a curse.''</p>
        <p>She said Britain had misinterpreted that extended legislative history when it decided that the rights would  apply only to the future and were related to an event -- the birth of a baby. ''Becoming a parent is not just a one-off event,'' she said. ''Parental leave rights are for a period of five years and are not a substitute for maternity leave, which is fixed by the birth of a child.'' Britain, she contended, is consequently in violation of European law.</p>
        <p>The director of a group called the Maternity Alliance, Christine Gowdridge, praised Mrs. Blair as a ''shining example to working women'' for continuing with her job so close to her due date, which is May 24.</p>
        <p>The comment recalled the ''fine example'' Mrs. Blair had cited in March when the prime minister of Finland, Paavo Lipponen, 59, took a week out of the office to be with his newborn daughter. Mrs. Blair at the time pointedly encouraged the ''widespread adoption'' of Mr. Lipponen's decision, but Mr. Blair, 47,  has ruled it out in his case.</p>
        <p>In comments published Sunday in The New York Times Magazine, he said: ''I know what people want me to say, but the truth is if I went away and stopped taking calls or having any conversations, it just wouldn't be real.</p>
        <p>''I'll take more time off. I'll try to cut down on official things. You've got to have some common sense about it -- you want to spend more time with your baby, but you don't give up the job. If people want their politicians to be honest, they have to know I cannot stop being prime minister.''</p>
