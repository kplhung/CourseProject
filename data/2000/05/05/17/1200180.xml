        <p>Like most Barnard students, the class of 2000 has been reminded repeatedly over the last four years that Barnard women change the world. They heard it again yesterday, of course, as the school celebrated its 108th commencement. But this time, they were not reminded just to change the world. They were reminded not to ignore life along the way.</p>
        <p>In a sunwashed ceremony on Lehman Lawn, the 558 graduates in pale blue recalled how they had already changed the world within the Barnard gates, with a recycling program, a move to socially responsible investing, and, Melissa Marrus, the senior class president, said, the most progressive condom distribution policy in the nation.</p>

        <p>Like most Barnard students, the class of 2000 has been reminded repeatedly over the last four years that Barnard women change the world. They heard it again yesterday, of course, as the school celebrated its 108th commencement. But this time, they were not reminded just to change the world. They were reminded not to ignore life along the way.</p>
        <p>In a sunwashed ceremony on Lehman Lawn, the 558 graduates in pale blue recalled how they had already changed the world within the Barnard gates, with a recycling program, a move to socially responsible investing, and, Melissa Marrus, the senior class president, said, the most progressive condom distribution policy in the nation.</p>
        <p>As they move on, they were urged to balance the political with the personal, the professional with family.</p>
        <p>Rather than taking the typical route of commencement addresses and looking forward, Doris Kearns Goodwin, the historian, looked backward, reflecting on that balance of love, work and play by looking at the last days of two historic figures she knows well: former President Lyndon B. Johnson and Eleanor Roosevelt.</p>
        <p>Ms. Goodwin started work as a 24-year-old intern for President Johnson -- ''I admit with some trepidation these days'' -- and became a White House fellow, before going on to help him with his memoirs.</p>
        <p>''On the surface, he had everything in the world to be grateful for,'' she said.</p>
        <p>His career had peaked with the presidency, he had a ranch, a penthouse in the city, a half-dozen cars, a boat, a pool and a movie theater in his home.</p>
        <p>Yet he had spent so many years pursuing power, he had no ability to appreciate anything else, Ms. Goodwin said.</p>
        <p>At baseball games, she said, he would wait for the action to stop so he could talk about politics.</p>
        <p>At movies, unless they were documentaries about his accomplishments or those of his wife, he would fall asleep. He spent his last days desperately counting the number of visitors to his library, and even offered free coffee and doughnuts to any visitor, Ms. Goodwin said.</p>
        <p>''Despite all his money and power, he was completely alone when he died,'' she said, ''his ultimate terror realized.''</p>
        <p>Eleanor Roosevelt, by contrast, took pleasure in her work for work's sake, using her power to help those less fortunate.</p>
        <p>''I would like to leave each of you with the hope that as you make your own choices over time, you will choose in such a way that allows your drive for achievement to be balanced by an equal commitment to love and to play, to family, friends and community,'' Ms. Goodwin told the graduates. ''You can say that your goal in life was not the perfection of work alone, but the perfection of a life.''</p>
        <p>Barnard awarded four honorary medals: to Annie Leibovitz, for photographs that ''inform and illuminate our visual perceptions''; to Hanna Holborn Gray, an academic and former president of the University of Chicago, for being ''a forceful voice for risk-taking and a passionate commitment to inquiry''; to Kathie Olson, chief scientist at NASA, for being ''deeply committed to making science intelligible to the public''; and to Ms. Goodwin, for being ''an accomplished biographer, a brilliant writer, a savvy commentator and the first woman journalist to enter the Red Sox locker room.''</p>
        <p>The graduates will also take part in commencement ceremonies at Columbia University, as will graduates of another Columbia affiliate, Teachers College, which also held its own commencement ceremony yesterday.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 20, 2000, Saturday  An article on Wednesday about Barnard College's commencement quoted a student speaker, Melissa Marrus, incorrectly. She applauded the Class of 2000 for having pushed the college to institute ''one of the most progressive sexual misconduct policies in the nation'' -- not the most progressive condom distribution policy.</p>
