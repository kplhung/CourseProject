        <p>The Environmental Protection Agency plans on Wednesday to announce new pollution-control rules that would cut truck and bus emissions drastically, in part through a 97 percent reduction in the sulfur content of diesel fuel over the next 10 years.</p>
        <p>The rules, the biggest change in regulation of trucks and buses in the agency's 30-year history, are intended to cut smog and remove from the air chemicals that have been linked to a variety of health problems, like cancer and asthma, E.P.A. officials said.</p>
        <p>The oil industry strongly opposes the new rules, which it insists will sharply raise the price of diesel fuel and could result in shortages, in part because refiners would be hard-pressed to install the new equipment needed to meet the requirements.</p>
        <p>The industry has said it is willing to accept sharp, but less severe, cuts in sulfur content.</p>
        <p>The draft rules, which may be modified during the course of public hearings this year, have been in preparation for several years.</p>
        <p>They are being announced now to give the Clinton administration time to hold the hearings and follow other procedures for public comment required by law before the rules can be made final. Under the Clean Air Act, the administration has the power to impose new rules without Congressional approval.</p>
        <p>The changes would be phased in over 10 years. The new limits on emissions from diesel trucks would apply only to new models, but the cuts in sulfur content in diesel fuel would reduce emissions from existing trucks and buses.</p>
        <p>The proposed rules call for a 95 percent reduction in nitrogen oxide emissions, which should cut smog appreciably, and a 90 percent reduction in particulate emissions, or soot.</p>
        <p>Sulfur particles are part of soot, so cutting the fuel's sulfur content would help reduce soot levels in the air.</p>
        <p>Getting rid of the sulfur allows engineers to install pollution reduction equipment on the trucks and buses, just as a generation ago, removing the lead from gasoline allowed the introduction of catalytic converters on cars that have been so successful in controlling their pollution. Very few trucks and buses now carry such devices.</p>
        <p>Environmentalists were ecstatic about the E.P.A.'s plans.</p>
        <p>''It will be the end of the big smoking dirty obnoxious truck as we know it today,'' said Frank O'Donnell, executive director of the Clean Air Trust, an environmental group.</p>
        <p>S. William Becker, executive director of the State and Territorial Air Pollution Program Administrators -- a national association of state regulators -- called trucks and buses ''one of the last remaining unregulated sources of air pollution.''</p>
        <p>''It will result in huge air quality benefits to the states,'' Mr. Becker said of the set of proposed rules. ''It will prevent tens of thousands of cancers. It will provide benefits to every locality in the country.''</p>
        <p>The oil industry warned that the planned 97 percent cut in allowable levels of sulfur in diesel -- to 15 parts per million, from the current level of 500 parts per million -- would raise fuel prices by 10 cents a gallon or more, and cause supply shortages. The petroleum industry is calling for a 90 percent cut, or 50 parts per million, as more economically practical.</p>
        <p>The cut proposed by the E.P.A., the American Petroleum Institute said, would make it difficult if not impossible for the industry to produce enough diesel. ''We don't think we can consistently produce and supply it,'' said Edward H. Murphy of the institute, the industry's biggest trade association.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphy said that some refineries have equipment on hand that could meet a ceiling of 50 parts per million, but that tougher rules would require the installation of expensive new production equipment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphy added that refiners say they are now struggling to meet new stringent limits on sulfur in gasoline and cannot handle new requirements of diesel as well.</p>
        <p>Administration officials said that the E.P.A. planned to hold five public hearings around the country in the next few weeks and then open a 45-day public comment period, allowing the agency to put the rule into final form this year, before President Clinton leaves office.</p>
        <p>The fuel rules would take effect in June 2006. The emissions cuts on the amount of nitrogen oxide produced by new trucks and buses would be phased in; a quarter of new vehicles would have to meet them in 2007, half by 2008, three-quarters by 2009 and all by 2010. The new rules on particulate emissions would take effect in 2007.</p>
        <p>When they introduce the proposal, administration officials plan to argue that diesel exhaust may cause lung cancer, and clearly brings on asthma attacks and other respiratory problems.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A. plans hearings in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Denver and Los Angeles, followed by the comment period for the public -- and affected industries -- to submit statements.</p>
        <p>The agency plans to seek comments on ''ways to incorporate additional flexibility for small oil refiners,'' an E.P.A. official said.</p>
        <p>In the past, the government has tried to write its regulations to allow smaller refiners to survive.</p>
        <p>Experts say that the public should not notice any change in the low-sulfur fuel other than its cost; it should smell the same and behave the same way in engines.</p>
        <p>The fuel industry has been far more vociferous than engine manufacturers in opposing the rules.</p>
        <p>The engine companies are apparently not eager for another battle with the E.P.A. Seven of the companies were caught by the agency installing ''defeat devices'' on their engines, devices that allowed the engines to pass certification tests but made them run much dirtier on the highways.</p>
        <p>The companies agreed in 1998 to pay $83.4 million in penalties, and to spend $850 million to produce cleaner engines.</p>
