        <p>Before the Miami Heat began its series with the Knicks, Heat management, apparently weary of having its home-court advantage diluted by supporters of other teams, offered free Heat clothing in exchange for any opponent's merchandise.</p>
        <p>The offer drew a response from hundreds of fans. About 1,500 pieces of clothing were traded in, at least a third of it from Knicks fans. Yet that may have been the proverbial drop in the bucket. When the Knicks play the Heat Wednesday night in Game 5 of their four-of-seven-game playoff series, about half of those filling American Airlines Arena will have allegiance to the Knicks.  The Heat's owner, Micky Arison, is a former resident of Queens who rooted strongly for New York-area teams until he moved to Miami with his family almost 35 years ago.</p>

        <p>Before the Miami Heat began its series with the Knicks, Heat management, apparently weary of having its home-court advantage diluted by supporters of other teams, offered free Heat clothing in exchange for any opponent's merchandise.</p>
        <p>The offer drew a response from hundreds of fans. About 1,500 pieces of clothing were traded in, at least a third of it from Knicks fans. Yet that may have been the proverbial drop in the bucket. When the Knicks play the Heat Wednesday night in Game 5 of their four-of-seven-game playoff series, about half of those filling American Airlines Arena will have allegiance to the Knicks.  The Heat's owner, Micky Arison, is a former resident of Queens who rooted strongly for New York-area teams until he moved to Miami with his family almost 35 years ago.</p>
        <p>''If I had to pick one thing that I can't understand as a fan it's the issue of Knicks fans that are not from New York, do not presently live in New York,'' Arison said. ''I don't mind if a fan comes here and has a John Starks uniform and all that. If he lives in New York, that's fine.''</p>
        <p>Arison takes exception, though, when someone who has lived in South Florida for at least a decade still roots openly for the Knicks against the hometown team. ''I find that very unfortunate, very frustrating.''</p>
