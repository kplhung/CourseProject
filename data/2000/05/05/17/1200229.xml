        <p>Remember the one about the guy who finished last in the Indianapolis 500 because he made a dozen pit stops to ask for directions? Later this year, more than one driver may have trouble finding his way around the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. On Sept. 24, Formula One drivers from 11 countries will compete in the United States Grand Prix, on a new 13-turn road-racing course cut into the infield at the venerable speedway.</p>
        <p>Nine of the turns will be right-hand corners, a first in the track's 91-year history (not counting all the wrong turns into the infamous wall). To confuse matters further, the 22 cars will race clockwise; the 500-mile Indy-car race on Memorial Day and Brickyard 400 stock-car race in August run counterclockwise. (Those races will not be affected by the new course.)</p>

        <p>Remember the one about the guy who finished last in the Indianapolis 500 because he made a dozen pit stops to ask for directions? Later this year, more than one driver may have trouble finding his way around the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. On Sept. 24, Formula One drivers from 11 countries will compete in the United States Grand Prix, on a new 13-turn road-racing course cut into the infield at the venerable speedway.</p>
        <p>Nine of the turns will be right-hand corners, a first in the track's 91-year history (not counting all the wrong turns into the infamous wall). To confuse matters further, the 22 cars will race clockwise; the 500-mile Indy-car race on Memorial Day and Brickyard 400 stock-car race in August run counterclockwise. (Those races will not be affected by the new course.)</p>
        <p>This will be the first appearance in the United States since 1991 for the international Formula One circuit, and the United States Grand Prix becomes the third major race to be held at the speedway. From 1911 to 1993 (with the exception of an unsuccessful race in 1916), the Indy 500 was the only race there each year; then came the inaugural Brickyard 400 Nascar race in 1994.</p>
        <p>Indy's 2.6-mile Formula One course is different from most of the 16 others worldwide in that there are virtually no elevation changes; the speedway's infield is flat, and the steepest climb will probably be the nine-degree banking in Turn 13. But the circuit's tighter confines should allow fans in many of the 200,000 available seats to see much of the track, something that is not possible on other road-racing circuits, which wind through hills and valleys. If anyone needs directions, here is a map.</p>
