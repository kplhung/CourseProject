        <p>The search for the next Rangers president and general manager is accelerating. Two National Hockey League officials said that Glen Sather met for the second time in 10 days with Madison Square Garden President Dave Checketts, this time in New York over last weekend.</p>
        <p>Sather, the Edmonton Oilers' president and general manager, would not discuss the situation yesterday.</p>
        <p>''You must have two good sources,'' Sather said with a laugh by telephone from Edmonton. ''I just don't think that it's very productive to make any comments on anything at this stage.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Don Maloney is preparing to make his pitch to be the general manager. According to two league officials, Maloney, the Rangers' assistant general manager, is hoping to meet with Checketts sometime in the next 10 days. Another possible candidate for the job is Anders Hedberg, who was a Ranger teammate of Maloney's for six seasons.</p>
        <p>Sather is still believed to be the Garden's first choice to be general manager. The Edmonton ownership board will meet next week. The feeling from Edmonton team officials is that neither the chairman, Cal Nichols, nor Sather would not be opposed to Sather leaving after 24 years in the organization. Sather may also head to Phoenix, where Wayne Gretzky could become part of a new Coyotes ownership group there.</p>
        <p>If Sather's destination is New York, Mark Messier's return may not be far behind. According to several league officials, Checketts wants Messier back, and Messier maintains a strong relationship with Sather, his longtime coach and general manager in Edmonton.</p>
        <p>For Messier to return, several things must happen. The Vancouver Canucks must first refuse to pick up the $6 million contract option on Messier, who will become a free agent on July 1. Second, the Rangers must hire a general manager and coach.</p>
        <p>If the Rangers are not able to work out a deal with the 56-year-old Sather, Maloney is a candidate Checketts could easily turn to.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to make any kind of public comment about my own situation,'' Maloney said yesterday. ''All I'll say is I like my job, I like working for the Rangers and I hope I'm here for a long time.''</p>
        <p>While preparing for the June 23 expansion draft, Maloney has apparently also sought out a number of general managers for their opinions on the Rangers' current woes.</p>
        <p>Maloney is likely trying to determine whether to recommend a major overhaul or less drastic changes, one N.H.L. official said. The Rangers have failed to qualify for the playoffs the last three seasons.</p>
        <p>Hedberg, meanwhile, said yesterday that he is willing to listen to an offer for a front office job with an N.H.L. team. The Swedish Ice Hockey Federation had scheduled a Monday news conference to announce Hedberg's appointment as the general manager of the national team through the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City and the 2002 world championships in Stockholm. At Hedberg's request, however, the news conference was postponed indefinitely.</p>
        <p>''I asked for a time out, because I did have an interest from the National Hockey League that I wanted to look into,'' Hedberg said from Stockholm last night. ''My request to the Swedish Federation was to let me look into this, to give me some more time.''</p>
        <p>No European has ever been a general manager of an N.H.L. team, even though the league's rosters have become increasingly international. Hedberg was an assistant general manager with the Toronto Maple Leafs two seasons ago. Last season, he was a European pro scout for Edmonton. Hedberg is also believed to be a candidate for the Calgary Flames' vacant general manager position.</p>
        <p>Maloney and Hedberg became Rangers in the 1978-79 season. Maloney, a left wing, played with the Rangers through the 1988-89 season. Hedberg, a right wing, was with the Rangers through the 1984-85 season. Sather, who played left wing, skated for the Rangers from 1970-71 to 1973-74.</p>
