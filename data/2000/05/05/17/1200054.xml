        <p>THIS is the city, Los Angeles, California. A sprawling urban oasis in a coastal desert, 465 square miles of stop-and-go freeways and clogged surface streets, of lane-changers and speed demons, secret shortcuts and rampant sport utility vehicles. It's easy to feel overwhelmed. I should know. I drive a car.</p>
        <p>I know, I know: ''Just the facts, ma'am.'' And yes, all around the country these days, most of the facts are encouraging. For the third year in a row last year, traffic fatality rates hit an all-time low in the United States, 1.5 deaths per 100 million miles traveled, one quarter the rate in 1966, when the government began keeping track.</p>
        <p>Cars, with air bags and seat belts and modular car seats for children, are safer than ever. Newer roads, with guardrails and dividers and gentle entrance ramps, are better engineered than ever. Alcohol-related vehicle deaths are down to their lowest levels in history. So why does a weekday drive on the San Diego Freeway rank with a trip to the dentist as an occasion of stress? Why does a commute that is encrusted in local lore as ''20 minutes, tops,'' invariably take 45? Why does dinner in Pasadena seem as distant as Portland, Me.?</p>
        <p>Consider more facts: Since 1970, the American population has grown about 30 percent; the number of licensed drivers has grown more than 60 percent; the number of registered vehicles has nearly doubled; and the total vehicle miles traveled has more than doubled. Yet total miles of road has grown just 6 percent, to 3.9 million in 1997 from 3.7 million in 1970.</p>
        <p>''Cars are safer, yes,'' said Gloria Ohland, the Southern California project manager for the Surface Transportation Policy Project, a national nonprofit coalition of organizations dedicated to transportation  policies that protect the environment and promote livable communities. ''But there are more cars on the road than ever before. As a result, the driving experience is very different from what it used to be, and from the way it's portrayed in the TV ads, where you always see the automobile out in nature,or driving on some beautiful deserted road.</p>
        <p>''Driving in traffic is stressful,'' Ms. Ohland added. ''You've got to pay attention, jockey for position.''</p>
        <p>Driving is not the only activity that is more stressful, of course. So, by most accounts, is life itself, in a 24-hour world of fax and modem, Internet and cell phone, pager and portable computer. People work across all parts of the day, and commute accordingly.</p>
        <p>More women are working, and many are presumably driving to and from work, among other places. A survey by the Surface Transportation Policy Project last year found that while urban sprawl means that everyone is driving more, mothers are driving most of all, almost an hour a day on average, up 13 percent from 1990 to 1995.</p>
        <p>''All of that really does contribute to cutting it close in the car'' by winking and nodding at traffic laws, said Marilena Amoni, the director of the Office of Traffic Injury Control Programs at the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the federal auto-safety agency.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Los Angeles, like much of the rest of the nation, is a place where speeding is routine, where a turn signal seems like an invitation to the driver in the next lane to speed up and block your move toward the exit, where running red lights is no longer rare. The consensus among traffic experts is that while incidents of grave violence, often lumped under the popular rubric of road rage, remain relatively isolated, anecdotal evidence suggests that ''aggressive driving,'' a far broader range of hostile behavior on the roads, including tailgating,  speeding and abrupt lane-changing, is more noticeable than in the past.</p>
        <p>In fact, according to preliminary data from the Traffic Safety Administration, speeding-related deaths rose slightly last year, to 12,672 from 12,477 in 1998. But the increase, 1.6 percent, was less than the increase in the number of miles driven, which was up 2.3 percent, meaning that the rate of speeding-related deaths per mile driven has dropped slightly.</p>
        <p>Seat belt use, which has generally risen over the last several decades, was about flat. The total number of crashes was also flat, at 6.3 million, while the number of injuries was up slightly, to 3.2 million from 3.19 million (though the rate of both, as a percentage of miles traveled, declined).</p>
        <p>In sum, the most dangerous part of driving is still the driver. For all the improvements in safety and engineering, driving is still by far the most dangerous thing most people do each day -- the leading cause of death for Americans under 40.</p>
        <p>''Our lives are extraordinarily safe in general,'' said Stephanie Faul, the communications director for the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, the research arm of the auto club. ''In the 20th century, we seem mostly to have banished death. The real risk is on the road. It is true that if everybody started wearing seat belts tomorrow, the death rate would drop. But it is very difficult to know what else would make a difference. The low-hanging fruit in the safety field has already been picked.''</p>
        <p>About half the states have carried out a program aimed at addressing aggressive driving -- including tougher penalties for infractions or violent acts committed on the road, driver re-education requirements for offenders and multitiered licensing schemes for first-time drivers. Results of these efforts have just begun to be analyzed.</p>
        <p>A survey last year by the AAA Foundation found reports of substantial reductions in injuries and crashes in jurisdictions with stepped-up enforcement campaigns. But it noted that most such analyses had been conducted by the sponsoring law-enforcement agencies themselves and may have been overly rosy.</p>
        <p>Ms. Amoni, of the Traffic Safety Administration, says officials there believe that more diligent enforcement of existing laws, against speeding and reckless driving, for example, would go a long way toward addressing the problems, which she says have long been present to some degree. But she and most other experts agree that changing human behavior makes changing engineering look easy.</p>
        <p>Part of the problem may actually be the decades-long emphasis on defensive driving, the watch-out-for-the-other-guy approach that the government and the auto industry adopted in their successful campaign to encourage seat belt use. All the attention on the faults of our neighbors might have blinded us to our own.</p>
        <p>''We've done interviews and focus groups with motorists,'' Ms. Amoni said, ''and if they speed or commit other infractions, they invariably view themselves as being in control and being good drivers, and it's always the other guy,'' who is at fault.</p>
        <p>The goal, she said, is to make drivers understand that ''it's not just the other guy; it's you, too.''</p>
        <p>She explained: ''If you don't use your turn signal, or you're weaving in and out of traffic, the other person really can't see you. It has to be both messages. We all exhibit this behavior at one time or another.''</p>
        <p>Leon James, a psychology professor at the University of Hawaii who has studied aggressive driving and road rage for 19 years, estimates that there are several billion ''aggressive exchanges'' between drivers in the United States each day, reflecting an overall decline in civility in every sphere.</p>
        <p>Dr. James based his analysis on the estimated daily number of 125 million drivers, each with an average 30-minute commute, resulting in hundreds of ''mini-exchanges,'' from braking when the car in front slows down to waiting to change lanes. If just 10 percent of those resulted in an angry exchange, it would amount to several billion such moments.</p>
        <p>''It's a generation, cultural, socialization process,'' said Dr. James, who began studying the problem after his wife complained about his driving. Initially, he denied having any faults. But then he began monitoring his behavior behind the wheel, even taping his hostile commentary about other drivers.</p>
        <p>''People say we start driver education at 15 or 16,'' Dr. James said. ''Wrong. We actually start it as children riding in our parents' cars, and children adopt and internalize the basic unfriendly behavior of the driver toward other drivers: cussing, impatience, fantasies of violence.''</p>
        <p>Dr. James has devised a philosophy he calls ''supportive driving,'' in which motorists look out for the other guy, and themselves, as team players in a crowded field. He envisions a three-step program, ''Acknowledge, Witness, Modify,'' that he would like to see used in small, self-help groups similar to Alcoholics Anonymous.</p>
        <p>The first challenge, he said, is to recognize flaws in one's own driving. Then pay special attention to those faults. Finally, modify them one trip at a time, resolving to signal on every lane change, for example.</p>
        <p>''I don't think people are capable of doing it own their own,'' Dr. James said. ''And you can't send everybody back to school. And you certainly can't arrest everybody. I don't think that's going to be practical.''</p>
        <p>LAST summer, Mark Nelson, a 37-year-old Internet consultant in Winnipeg, Manitoba, and a self-confessed road rager, started a Web site, www.RoadRagers.com. It is financed by advertising and aimed at creating an online confessional community that allows angry drivers to calm down by posting the license plate number, vehicle make and model and location of the antisocial drivers who enrage them.</p>
        <p>In its first eight months, the site has drawn about 45,000 hits from drivers around the world who have shared their feelings and frustrations.</p>
        <p>''Some jerk cut me off and I felt like pulling up next to him and pushing him off the road,'' reads one recent posting. ''Then I just changed the radio station to a calmer station and ended up calming down. Twenty minutes later, I was safe at home with my family -- no harm, no foul. Who knows what would have happened if I would have given in to the rage.''</p>
        <p>Responding to an e-mail query, Mr. Nelson acknowledged that the site's hall of shame ''doesn't really mean much, because it's unlikely that the person who peeved you off will ever read it.'' But he added, ''It just makes people feel better, without harm.''</p>
        <p>Others advocate more basic approaches. Ryan Snyder, a transportation consultant here who is the chairman of the legislative committee of the California Bicycle Coalition, helped draft a bill pending in the State Assembly that would require communities to consider pedestrian and bicycle safety when setting speed limits.</p>
        <p>Currently in California, as in most of the  nation, speed limits outside purely residential areas are set not by fiat, but at the 85th percentile of the speed at which traffic is flowing. So when a new road opens, engineers use traffic surveys to set the speed limit at the 16th fastest car out of 100 cars surveyed on similar roads.</p>
        <p>''The assumption of this philosophy, and to me it's really inaccurate, is that the vast majority of drivers drive at a safe speed,'' Mr. Snyder said. ''Traffic-enforcement officers are reluctant to enforce any infraction unless it's 10 miles over the speed limit, because they're afraid it'll get thrown out of court, and it often does.''</p>
        <p>According to last year's preliminary figures, fatalities on roads with posted speed limits of 55 m.p.h. or higher rose 2 percent, to 23,559, while deaths on roads with speeds of less than 55 m.p.h. fell 3 percent, to 17,786.</p>
        <p>In fact, said Ms. Amoni, of the Traffic Safety Administration, the Interstate system is one of the safest transportation networks in the world. With its lanes divided by medians or barriers, and its guardrails, rumble strips and other safety features, it is very forgiving of driver error. ''But when that behavior spills over into speeding in school zones or neighborhoods or running through crossing arms at railroad grades, that has to be perceived as risky,'' she said.</p>
        <p>On my own residential street in the heart of Los Angeles, drivers taking shortcuts to the arterial streets and more distant freeways routinely roar down the block at well above the putative limit of 30 m.p.h.</p>
        <p>To the American Highway Users Alliance, a 68-year-old coalition of business and civic groups, the answer is simple: build more highways. The group recently released a study estimating that the 17 worst highway bottlenecks in the nation, four of which are in Los Angeles, cost $5.5 billion a year in lost time, fuel, accidents, added costs to employers and damage to the environment.</p>
        <p>''Roads are suffering from outmoded design, and many were not built to carry the number of people they do today,'' said William D. Fay, the president and chief executive of the alliance. ''While overall deaths have gone down, it's because of things like fewer drunk drivers and better-built cars. One area where fatalities have gone up is attributable to inadequate road design.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Fay contended that even simple, relatively inexpensive changes like guardrails can make a big difference. He also questioned the conventional wisdom that congested cities like Los Angeles are running out of room for new roads. At 52 miles of freeway per million people, the greater Los Angeles area has the lowest per capita ratio in the country, in which the national average is 114 freeway miles per million people.</p>
        <p>But no major new freeways are planned here at the moment, and the last major planned stretch of the existing network, the 710 Freeway extension through South Pasadena, has been blocked for more than 30 years by its own road rage: community opposition to destroying a quiet neighborhood of houses.</p>
