        <p>In some respects it seems as if the WB network would like to have its cake and eat it, too.</p>
        <p>The six shows the network plans to add to its fall schedule are a mix of the cutting-edge comedies that marked the early years of the Fox network and wholesome, family fare that an old-fashioned advertiser can stand behind.</p>
        <p>However, in announcing its schedule yesterday, WB's programmers said they were not planning any drastic changes to reverse a ratings slide in which the network has lost 19 percent of its household audience.</p>
        <p>In other words, young, white and very attractive faces will continue to dominate WB's program lineup as it continues to court young, female viewers.</p>
        <p>The network's trademark dramas, heavy in the angst of teens and young adults, are all returning, and its Monday through Wednesday schedule will remain essentially intact.</p>
        <p>In December, however, ''Felicity,'' the hourlong drama set at the campus of a university in New York City and starring Keri Russell, will relinquish its time slot on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. It will be replaced by 13 episodes of ''Jack and Jill'' and then return for 11 more programs.</p>
        <p>On Thursdays at 8 p.m., the network will run a new drama called ''Gilmore Girls,'' which is the product of an agreement between the network and a group of advertisersthat donated $1 million toward the development of family friendly programming. The show focuses on the struggles of a mother and daughter who are uncommonly close in age.</p>
        <p>Another family-friendly show is ''Sabrina, the Teenage Witch.'' It was cut from ABC, where it led off the ''T.G.I.F.'' block of shows aimed at families and younger viewers.</p>
        <p>''Sabrina'' will begin WB's own Friday night block of programming for youngsters, to be called ''T.G.I.W.B.'' (It will replace the block of sitcoms featuring black lead actors, which will move from Fridays to Sundays, and also feature ''The PJ's,'' an animated show previously on Fox.)</p>
        <p>''Sabrina'' will be followed by a new show called ''Grosse Pointe,'' a comedy about the antics behind the scenes of a primetime soap opera.  Judging from a clip shown to advertisers yesterday, it is as racy as anything on network television. Darren Starr, who is responsible for HBO's ''Sex and the City,'' created ''Grosse Pointe.''</p>
        <p>Likewise, ''Hype,'' a new sketch comedy show that will run on Sundays, and ''Nikki,'' a sitcom featuring Nikki Cox as an aspiring Las Vegas showgirl, are being billed as cutting-edge.</p>
        <p>WB executives yesterday attributed the network's decline in the ratings from fifth place to sixth, behind the fledgling UPN network, in large part to a decision by the superstation WGN to drop its programming, which reduced WB's available household audience by 10 million homes.</p>
        <p>But they also pointed to Keri Russell's hair: her decision to cut it very short coincided with a drop in the ratings for ''Felicity.'' The program  is expected to do better next season, said the network's entertainment president, Susanne Daniels, because the actress's hair has ''been growing in like weeds.''</p>
        <p>This is the new WB schedule:</p>
        <p>MONDAY: ''7th Heaven,'' ''Roswell''</p>
        <p>TUESDAY: ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' ''Angel''</p>
        <p>WEDNESDAY: ''Dawson's Creek,'' ''Felicity/Jack &amp; Jill''</p>
        <p>THURSDAY: ''Gilmore Girls,'' ''Charmed''</p>
        <p>FRIDAY: ''Sabrina, the Teenage Witch,'' ''Grosse Point,'' ''Popular''</p>
        <p>SUNDAY: ''The PJ's,'' ''The Jamie Foxx Show,'' ''The Steve Harvey Show,'' ''For Your Love,'' ''Hype,'' ''Nikki.''</p>
