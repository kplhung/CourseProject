        <p>Article discusses conflict between Yonkers, NY, Mayor John Spencer and Schools Superintendent Andre J Hornsby over school financing, including $34 million shortfall school district predicts it will face this September, and about 800 teachers and other staff members it says will have to be laid off as result; photo (M)</p>

        <p>As in any fight over school financing, the struggle playing out here is an exercise in higher math: the $34 million shortfall the school district predicts it will face this September, and the about 800 teachers and other staff members it says it will have to lay off as a result.</p>
        <p>But beyond the big numbers, the battle has come down to a much simpler equation: a war of wills between the schools superintendent and the mayor. And it has stirred up racial resentments and recriminations in a community that has grappled for 14 years with a federal government lawsuit charging the city and schools with racial segregation.</p>

        <p>As in any fight over school financing, the struggle playing out here is an exercise in higher math: the $34 million shortfall the school district predicts it will face this September, and the about 800 teachers and other staff members it says it will have to lay off as a result.</p>
        <p>But beyond the big numbers, the battle has come down to a much simpler equation: a war of wills between the schools superintendent and the mayor. And it has stirred up racial resentments and recriminations in a community that has grappled for 14 years with a federal government lawsuit charging the city and schools with racial segregation.</p>
        <p>Mayor John Spencer called last week for the resignation of the schools chief, Andre J. Hornsby, whom he championed as an energizing agent of change when Dr. Hornsby was hired less than two years ago. Dr. Hornsby, who recently flirted with jobs in other districts, has so far refused to leave, saying he is committed to the district -- the state's fourth largest, with 26,000 students.</p>
        <p>Local newspapers have reported that the turning point in the mayor's change of heart was a four-day teachers' strike at the beginning of this school year. Ellis Cousens, a member of the school board, said differences between the two men have been building for months, centering on issues of leadership style even more than policy.</p>
        <p>''They are both strong-willed men with strong views as to the way things ought to be done,'' Mr. Cousens said with a sigh. ''They're both very skilled, but unfortunately, they have personalities that clash, and they clash pretty severely. It becomes most poignant where there's an issue that's as high stakes as the funding of the school system.''</p>
        <p>Their fight has grown to such a pitch that racial rhetoric has flared again. Dr. Hornsby is black. The mayor is white. And last Sunday, worshipers at Messiah Baptist Church held hands with black city officials, members of the clergy and Latino City Council members to show solidarity with Dr. Hornsby.</p>
        <p>''Racism is not the only factor, but you can't discount it,'' said Leonard Buddington, president of the Yonkers chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The charges of racism center on the mayor's call for Dr. Hornsby's resignation just after the superintendent -- Yonkers's first black schools chief -- pressed the city to appeal a federal court ruling in the desegregation lawsuit. That ruling had led the state to withdraw $47 million in special financing for the district that was intended to help close gaps in achievement between white and minority students.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hornsby said an appeal was necessary because vestiges of racism still existed in the school system. But the mayor said that would be ''needless litigation,'' asserting that the system had been fully integrated.</p>
        <p>The battle over money came to a head last week, when Mayor Spencer proposed a school budget $8 million smaller than this year's $326.1 million package. He later restored nearly $9 million, but the district said it needed an additional $34 million to cover all programs designed to improve student achievement. It had hoped the desegregation money would pay for that.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hornsby said he would have to cut nearly 20 percent of the district's 4,500 workers. ''This solution is draconian in nature,'' he said today. ''You cannot pull this kind of money out of a public school system and expect not to destroy the system.''</p>
        <p>Tonight, he met with city officials, state legislators, parents and union representatives to devise a plan to lobby Albany for more money.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hornsby said he had been counting on money that would come from settling the district's federal desegregation case -- until he learned that the city was not willing to press for that solution any longer.</p>
        <p>Instead, Dr. Hornsby suggested that the city channel money from increased taxes into the school district; that infuriated the mayor. Dr. Hornsby then urged the school board to press for an appeal of the desegregation case; that angered the mayor even further.</p>
        <p>Mayor Spencer did not return repeated phone calls today seeking comment. But the local daily newspaper, The Journal News, quoted him last week as saying that if Dr. Hornsby believed there was still racism in the schools, ''then he's not the right superintendent for Yonkers.''</p>
        <p>The city is already raising taxes to cover costs. Mayor Spencer is planning to increase homeowners' taxes by 9.6 percent -- an added $427 a year, on average -- and much of the population of Yonkers is elderly or poor.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hornsby was recruited from a mostly minority district in Texas specifically to deal with gaps in achievement between the city's white and minority students.</p>
        <p>Since he arrived in August 1998, he has scarcely seen a day without controversy. Parents and teachers have complained vigorously about his blunt, autocratic style and his initiatives -- including his attempt to double the standard 45-minute high school class period to 90 minutes, a major bone of contention in the teachers' strike.</p>
        <p>But many parents who have been sharply critical of Dr. Hornsby's leadership style said that in this instance, he had been right to push for the desegregation money.</p>
        <p>''It's the first decent thing that he's done, standing up to Spencer like that,'' said Louise Jacob, who has a daughter in middle school. ''And it's such an irony if Dr. Hornsby should be asked to leave after the first good thing he's done.''</p>
        <p>The mayor, she said, has not helped much, either.</p>
        <p>''I really think Mayor Spencer is more concerned with the one-third of Yonkers kids that go to parochial school,'' she said. ''I really don't think he cares much about the public schools. Whoever he's fighting for, it's not the kids in Yonkers.''</p>
