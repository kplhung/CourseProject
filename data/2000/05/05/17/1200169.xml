        <p>Lycos Agrees to Be Bought By Spanish Telephone Giant  Lycos, the big Internet portal, agreed to be bought by Terra Networks, the Internet unit of the Spanish telephone giant Telefonica, for $12.5 billion in stock.</p>
        <p>The companies said the combination, which also includes a partnership with the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann, would create the first truly global Internet company with operations in 37 countries. [Page C4.]</p>
        <p>Robert J. Davis, the self-described driven chief executive of Lycos, lives by a couple of mottos. ''You let up, you lose,'' is one. ''Speed is life'' is another. The Boss. [C8.]</p>

        <p>Investors Assail BMW's Rover Deal  A week after BMW agreed to pay a British group more than $750 million to take over the German automaker's money-losing Rover subsidiary, angry investors accused BMW's top management of amateurism, arrogance, bad judgment and deceptive statements. And in a blunt rebuttal to aspiring buyers, the controlling Quandt family announced that it had ''not the slightest interest in selling'' and is ''100 percent committed to BMW.'' [C3.]</p>
        <p>Mining Company Chief to Step Down  Anglo American, the world's largest mining company, announced that Julian Ogilvie Thompson, the last of a generation of managers who dominated the South African-led company during and beyond the apartheid era, would step down as chief executive.

        <p>Consumer Prices Unchanged in April  Consumer prices were unchanged in April and the construction of new homes rose, government figures showed, signaling that the economy was expanding with little to no inflation.
