        <p>LAST winter, I ate at a small restaurant called Chez Leger on the Caribbean island of Martinique, where the menu was incredibly simple. Almost every item -- chicken, tuna, quail, pork and veal kidneys -- was grilled. More important, all of it was served with the same thin, powerful sauce, made of lime juice, scallions, chili and garlic, with loads of allspice.</p>
        <p>It was the allspice that made the sauce unusual; similar sauces without it are quite common, all over the world. But there was more to the mixture than that: the garlic and scallions looked raw but had lost their harshness and become easily digestible, and the base of the sauce was not oil but water.</p>

        <p>LAST winter, I ate at a small restaurant called Chez Leger on the Caribbean island of Martinique, where the menu was incredibly simple. Almost every item -- chicken, tuna, quail, pork and veal kidneys -- was grilled. More important, all of it was served with the same thin, powerful sauce, made of lime juice, scallions, chili and garlic, with loads of allspice.</p>
        <p>It was the allspice that made the sauce unusual; similar sauces without it are quite common, all over the world. But there was more to the mixture than that: the garlic and scallions looked raw but had lost their harshness and become easily digestible, and the base of the sauce was not oil but water.</p>
        <p>With the help of a friend who was born on Martinique, I was able to duplicate this amazingly versatile sauce. It's called sauce au chien, which translates roughly as dog sauce. And the strong elements are tamed by pouring boiling water over the solid ingredients. Lime juice is added at the last moment, so the sauce retains its freshness.</p>
        <p>If you can get a Scotch bonnet pepper, its fierce heat and distinctive flavor will make the sauce more authentic, but I used a small amount of Asian chili paste instead and thought the results fine. Jalapenos or just hot red pepper flakes will also work. If you have the patience to grind whole allspice, the sauce will taste fresher, and I thought it was worth the effort, but ground allspice will do, as long as it is fresh.</p>
        <p>Sauce au chien is a spectacular accompaniment to any hearty grilled food. In the last week I've eaten it with grilled ribs, grilled pork chops, grilled shrimp and grilled chicken. I liked it best with the ribs and chicken but would not hesitate to try it with almost anything except delicate fish.</p>
        <p>GRILLED CHICKEN THIGHS WITH SAUCE AU CHIEN  Time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon peeled and slivered or minced garlic  6 scallions, trimmed and minced  1 Scotch bonnet or jalapeno pepper, stemmed, seeded and minced, or chili paste or crushed red pepper flakes to taste (start with  1/2 teaspoon)  Salt and fresh black pepper</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon ground allspice, or to taste  1 tablespoon peanut or canola oil  8 chicken thighs, about 2 pounds  Juice of 1 lime.</p>
        <p>1. Prepare a charcoal or gas grill, or preheat the broiler. While it is heating, prepare the sauce: in a small bowl, combine the garlic, scallions, chili, salt, allspice and oil. Add  1/2 cup boiling water; stir and set aside.</p>
        <p>2. Sprinkle the chicken with salt and pepper, and grill or broil, turning 2 or 3 times, until it is cooked through, about 15 minutes. Taste the sauce, and add more chili, salt, pepper or allspice if needed. Stir in the lime juice. Serve the chicken hot or at room temperature, passing the sauce at the table.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
