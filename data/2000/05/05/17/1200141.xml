        <p>THE names of the walls and pavilions of the New York Chinese Scholar's Garden at the Staten Island Botanical Garden are as lovely as its pools and pavilions and gates: Delight of the Moon Portal, Wandering-in-Bamboo Courtyard, Court of Uncommon Reeds. The garden -- the only one of its kind in the country -- has been much remarked upon for its beauty.</p>
        <p>It would be crass in such a refined and otherworldly setting to bring up the cost of the $4.2 million project, and yet we must, for there is another astonishing fact about this singularly beautiful garden:</p>
        <p>Much of it was built with another's country's money.</p>
        <p>China and its Landscape Architecture Company contributed $1.2 million in labor and materials. The person who convinced them to do so -- who conceived of the Scholar's Garden 16 years ago and paid with her own money to travel to China at a time when she could barely afford to put gas in her car -- is the garden's  president, Frances X. Paulo Huber.</p>
        <p>How did you do that, Ms. Huber?</p>
        <p>''They were a little surprised when I first brought it up,'' says Ms. Huber, who starts a discussion straight-laced in pearls and pumps, but will soon be traipsing through the garden in red clogs telling stories of singing a duet with the actor Richard Chamberlain at Gracie Mansion and of frisky artisans. ''But they liked the idea.''</p>
        <p>People liked the idea of spending $1 million?</p>
        <p>''The idea of their contribution originally was quite small -- just the Moon Viewing Pavilion, which would have been about $60,000. Over time, it went from that to $1.2 million.''</p>
        <p>Oh.</p>
        <p>''I guess I wasn't embarrassed to have anyone laugh in my face. I didn't go away. Persistence is a very important factor.''</p>
        <p>It is risky business to suggest one person is responsible for the rebirth of an 85-acre property, but the contributions of Ms. Huber, a former landscape architect who has headed the Staten Island Botanical Garden for 16 years, have been enormous.</p>
        <p>She came to the garden as its $20,000-a-year executive director (now it's $80,000), when it was a volunteer organization, secured financing and co-wrote a master plan.  She arranged for the new, living exhibit: 13 Chinese artisans demonstrating crafts such as silk reeling, calligraphy and kite-making.</p>
        <p>''I've known her at least 17 years, and she's good, she's good,'' said the city's parks commissioner, Henry J. Stern. ''The other gardens have always been in the shadow of the super-loaded; the New York Botanical Garden, with Enid Haupt, is a wealthy and first-rate scientific institution. It gets National Science grants and so on. The three lesser fry, Brooklyn, Staten Island and Queens, have had more difficulty. But the Queens Botanical Garden foundered while Staten Island is moving steadily forward. Getting this Chinese Scholar's Garden, they landed something unrivaled anywhere in the city.''</p>
        <p>Loaded, by the way, Ms. Huber's family was not, but they were prominent in Staten Island. Her late father, Frank D. Paulo, was a surrogate court judge so popular that there is a statue of him in front of the borough hall.</p>
        <p>From where do we trace the roots of Ms. Huber's passion for exotic gardens? The older brother, Thomas, whom she idolized, who was a gardener? The well-traveled older woman, a friend of the family, who loved Japanese culture?</p>
        <p>Whatever, Ms. Huber and her brother were serious gardeners. As teenagers, they built a Japanese garden around their house with a lily pond, a moss garden, a torii gateway. If there were only three tricolored beech trees available on the East Coast, and a tree cost $500, they earned the money with their small gardening business and bought it. Good experience that, Ms. Huber now thinks, taught her a special garden might take years. Good experience, too, for her brother, who is now Staten Island's parks commissioner.</p>
        <p>Ms. Huber studied art and architecture at New York University and earned a master's in landscape architecture from the University of Massachusetts before becoming involved with the botanical garden.</p>
        <p>It took 14 years to raise the money for the Chinese Scholar's Garden, and when the shipping containers were finally unloaded on the garden lawns, it was, Ms. Huber says, the most beautiful thing she'd ever seen.</p>
        <p>The 40 Chinese artisans, who lived on the grounds, were sometimes rambunctious: after the fact, one came to her for repayment of $400, having taken his colleagues on an educational tour of Manhattan's ''exotic'' clubs. Ms. Huber's own rambunctious moment: a late-night party at Gracie Mansion, which she attended with her husband, Robert E. Huber, then a speechwriter for Mayor Giuliani, some years ago. The party followed an Inner Circle dinner, at which Richard Chamberlain had appeared with the mayor in a sketch.</p>
        <p>Not all Ms. Huber's girlhood dreams involved gardens -- a few had revolved around Richard Chamberlain, in his television role as the sensitive Dr. Kildare. Ms. Huber particularly cherished an episode in which Dr. Kildare sings a song called ''Hi-Lili, Hi-Lo'' to a dying girl with whom he has fallen in love. Mr. Chamberlain did not seem too excited about singing the song with Ms. Huber -- in fact, she says, he was visibly distressed -- but he did. You know how it is when Ms. Huber wants something.</p>
