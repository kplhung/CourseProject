        <p>This is a city where anything can happen: a jazz parade might suddenly strike up a march in a quiet residential neighborhood at 1 a.m., or in the middle of the afternoon a tourist restaurant could be invaded by masked gunmen.</p>
        <p>For six years Ernie K-Doe's Mother-in-Law Lounge, a corner bar opened by this 60's rhythm-and-blues singer, has been a perfect embodiment of New Orleans unpredictability: every visit to Mr. K-Doe's shrine to himself is an adventure. But nothing in my experience interviewing musicians or spending time at the Mother-in-Law Lounge could have prepared me for what happened there this month.</p>
        <p>In the history books the 64-year-old  Mr. K-Doe, whose original name was Ernest Kador Jr., is known for recording the No. 1 hit ''Mother-in-Law'' followed by several regional successes. But to the denizens of New Orleans today he is a bona fide character, brimming with unpredictable energy and an unharnessed ego that has led him to nickname himself the Emperor of the Universe. He is a golden oldie who has lifted himself off the skids with the support of a new wife, the opening of an off-the-beaten-track bar and tireless dedication to the musical temple that is himself.</p>
        <p>''Ain't but two of us left,'' he said one night behind the bar at the Mother-in-Law Lounge. ''James Brown and K-Doe.''</p>
        <p>In his performance at the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, which ran from April 28 to May 7, Mr. K-Doe strung his old hits together in a set that ran 20 minutes shorter than the time allotted to it. Wearing a canary yellow suit with rhinestones and stitched music notes, a feathered yellow crown and a flowing yellow cape with the words ''Emperor Ernie K-Doe'' emblazoned on the back, he announced songs with lines like, ''Here's another million-seller by Ernie K-Doe: I never miss.'' His voice was rough, ragged and tended to flatten out, but he nonetheless put on a blaring, madcap R-and-B performance that held the audience gleefully rapt.</p>
        <p>And the performance didn't stop at Jazz Fest. He and his wife, Antoinette (who is also his seamstress, backup singer and manager), made sure that the music continued each night at the Mother-in-Law Lounge. On a typical night there Mr. K-Doe stays behind the bar. In the front of the room there is a jukebox filled with Ernie K-Doe recordings from the 50's on. When a patron plays one of Mr. K-Doe's songs, the legend himself will usually pick an old brown taxicab microphone off the back counter and sing along.</p>
        <p>Not only will he karaoke, but he will also talk to his own voice on the CD, making comments like, ''Tell 'em, K-Doe,'' or ''I'm cocky, but I'm good.'' Occasionally, in a small room in the back, Mr. K-Doe's flesh-and-blood mother-in-law can be seen watching television, oblivious to the havoc in the bar.</p>
        <p>For the nights of Jazz Fest, Mr. K-Doe brought in a dapper-looking lounge performer named Rico Watts, who plays at the bar on Sundays, to accompany him on synthesizer and drum machine. It was on one of those nights that a photographer and I visited to prepare this column about Mr. K-Doe, who sat at the bar running his long, ladylike fingernails through his suspiciously elaborate long black hair. We requested permission for an interview and photographs, and he and his wife were only too glad to cooperate.</p>
        <p>While on break between sets, we walked out to Mr. K-Doe's touring van, with his name emblazoned on the side surrounded by stars, and talked. He spoke of wanting to let the record labels know that he was actually free and looking for a deal, and then proceeded to recite several of his favorite immodesties, including his assertion that ''there are only three songs that will last until the end of the earth.'' Those songs are: ''Amazing Grace,'' ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' and ''Mother-in-Law.'' Because, he observed, ''there will always be mothers-in-law.''</p>
        <p>Afterward, we headed back into the bar to take photographs and watch him perform his second set. During his last number, the racial unity song ''Black Boy, White Boy,'' he stopped singing and looked directly at me. ''I was good to you, wasn't I?''</p>
        <p>''You sure were, K-Doe.''</p>
        <p>''Then why are you trying to record my show?''</p>
        <p>I looked down at my lap: the recorder I had used to tape our conversation was sitting there, though, of course, it hadn't been turned on since the interview. Suddenly, the music stopped and Mrs. K-Doe came roaring from behind the bar, demanding that the tape be handed over. ''We aren't playing any more music until you give us the tape,'' she shouted.</p>
        <p>I offered to let them hear the tape to prove that there was nothing but interview on it. But Mrs. K-Doe wouldn't hear any of it. And I wasn't going to relinquish the tape especially since it included other interviews I had conducted in New Orleans.</p>
        <p>''Lock the door!'' she barked at a man who was either a heavy-set regular or a security guard. ''Nobody's getting out of here until he hands over the tape.''</p>
        <p>The standoff took an unexpected turn when Mrs. K-Doe called the police. She screamed that they would force me to hand over the tape as well as the film, because she had decided that she wanted the film as well. As an R-and-B singer coming up in the 50's and 60's, he was no doubt cheated out of his fair share from his music, which may help explain why they thought I was trying to make a bootleg of the show to sell for personal profit at some sort of K-Doe black market swap meet.</p>
        <p>In addition the K-Does had been extremely exhausted and busy the weeks of Jazz Fest, with Mrs. K-Doe staying up all night to make costumes and cook for her husband's concerts, parties and interviews.</p>
        <p>After an hour of surreal negotiations outside the club with two police officers (which included a search of the photographer's bag for more K-Doe bootleg tapes), Mrs. K-Doe calmed down, and no arrests were made. ''I'm sorry this misunderstanding happened,'' I told her and pointed out to her that the article I intended to write would let more people know about Mr. K-Doe and their bar.</p>
        <p>She barked back: ''This man is a legend. He doesn't need any publicity.''</p>
        <p>Well, he's going to get it anyway, and don't let this tale discourage you from dropping in. Take it from someone who will probably never be allowed to enter the Mother-In-Law Lounge again, my visits to New Orleans won't be the same without it.</p>
