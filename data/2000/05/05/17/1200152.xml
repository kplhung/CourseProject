        <p>Lycos, the big Internet portal, agreed yesterday to be bought by Terra Networks, the Internet unit of the Spanish telephone giant Telefonica, for $12.5 billion in stock.</p>
        <p>In an announcement made in New York, the companies said that the combination, which also includes a partnership with the German media conglomerate Bertelsmann, would create the first truly global Internet company with operations in 37 countries.</p>
        <p>''Nobody is in more countries and more languages than we are today,'' said Bob Davis, the chief executive of Lycos.</p>
        <p>Acquiring Lycos gives Terra Networks access to the more than 30 million Hispanics in the United States and helps it compete in Asia and Europe. Lycos gains Spanish-language content and better access to Latin America, where Terra is one of the region's biggest Internet providers.</p>
        <p>The deal finds an unexpected home for Lycos, which has tried unsuccessfully to sell itself to nearly every major Internet and media company, Internet executives said. While Lycos is the nation's No. 4 portal, it has grown much more slowly than Yahoo, the market leader. Last year, it struck a complex deal to combine with Home Shopping Network, Ticketmaster, and other units of USA Networks Inc. But that deal was scuttled because investors complained that they were not receiving enough of a premium over the existing stock market value.</p>
        <p>Terra Networks, by contrast, is offering an enormous premium. It will exchange stock worth $97.55 for each Lycos share, a 106 percent premium over Lycos's value last week before the deal was announced. Shares of Lycos rose $11 yesterday, to $72.625, while Terra Networks fell 2 euros, to 62 euros, or $55.88.</p>
        <p>As part of the deal, Bertelsmann agreed to spend $1 billion over the next five years to promote its books and music sales operation and its various other media properties on Terra Lycos, as the new portal and combined company will be known. Bertelsmann already has a joint venture in Europe with Lycos.</p>
        <p>It was also a partner in America Online's European operation, but it sold that stake back to America Online after AOL agreed to buy Time Warner. That sale prevented Bertelsmann from owning a competitor to AOL for three years. After that agreement runs out, Bertelsmann expects to trade its stake in Lycos Europe to Terra Lycos in return for equity in that company. Thomas Middelhoff, the chief executive of Bertelsmann, will then join the Terra Lycos board.</p>
        <p>The deal also creates a new company that will create data services to be offered through mobile telephones, mainly through Telefonica's cellular systems in Spain and Latin America.</p>
        <p>But the combination of Terra Networks and Lycos has some problems, analysts said. There are few overlapping operations from which to gain any significant savings. Moreover, the value of the Terra shares that Lycos holders will receive is unusually high, even by Internet standards, they said.</p>
        <p>''As a Lycos shareholder, I am very concerned about getting a very inflated piece of paper,'' said Michael P. Wallace, an analyst with UBS Warburg, who noted that Lycos shareholders may well cash out by selling their Terra shares. ''When the deal is done, a lot of people will be hitting the road.''</p>
        <p>Other analysts, however, said the price was more than fair.</p>
        <p>''From the Lycos shareholder's standpoint, this is a win,'' said Paul Noglows of Chase H&amp;Q. ''This is better than the USA deal, which ended up valuing Lycos at $43 and even higher than Lycos's all-time high of $93.''</p>
        <p>Other analysts noted that while the international scope of the company is its greatest strength, it also presents challenges.</p>
        <p>''You have to worry about management and cultural issues that occur normally in any merger that may be much greater in a cross-border acquisition,'' Mr. Wallace said.</p>
        <p>The management structure of the new company, in fact, will be complex. Juan Villalonga, the chairman and chief executive of Telefonica and the chairman of Terra, will remain the chairman of Terra Lycos, which will be based in Madrid. Mr. Davis of Lycos will be chief executive of the combined company but will remain in Waltham, Mass. Mr. Davis does not speak Spanish.</p>
        <p>The deal does not set the actual amount of Terra's shares that will be exchanged for each Lycos share. Rather, Lycos shareholders will receive Terra shares worth $97.55. But there is a collar that says that each Lycos share will be converted into no less than 1.433 Terra shares nor no more than 2.15 shares. That means that if the value of Terra shares falls by more than 20 percent, Lycos stockholders will receive less than $97.55. Lycos shareholders will own between 37 percent and 46 percent of the combined company once the deal closes, which the companies said they expected to happen in the third quarter after regulatory and shareholder approval.</p>
        <p>The companies said that Terra planned to raise $2 billion in a rights offering to existing shareholders. Telefonica said it would subscribe to any of the offering not purchased by other Terra shareholders. That will give the combined company $3.5 billion in cash.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis said that the cash would allow the new company to be aggressive in acquiring other Internet companies.</p>
        <p>For analysts, however, the biggest question is the valuation of Terra,  which is estimated to have half the revenue of Lycos this year. It has been valued at nearly three times Lycos.</p>
        <p>Moreover, much of Terra's revenue is from providing Internet access, which investors have generally viewed as less attractive than operating Web sites, as Lycos does.</p>
        <p>Lanny Baker, an analyst with Salomon Smith Barney, noted that Terra had a value of $10,000 for each subscriber. America Online, by contrast, is valued at less than $5,000 for each subscriber.</p>
        <p>Or looked at another way, the pending combination of AOL and Time Warner is valued at 8.4 times its estimated 2001 revenue. The combination of Terra and Lycos is valued at 50 times 2001 revenue, according to an analysis by Chase H&amp;Q.</p>
        <p>''To say that this is as strong a company as AOL-Time Warner is quite a stretch,'' Mr. Noglows said.</p>
