        <p>IT will disappoint some cooks on sight, for it looks like mayonnaise. It will trouble gardeners, who will not understand how a noble artichoke could be reduced to something with so little visible remains. It will be pooh-poohed by purists who never buy anything in a jar.</p>
        <p>But this little jar of artichoke and garlic sauce, made by Gran Cucina in the Piedmont region of Italy, will send those without preconceptions into a frenzy. It is a silk-smooth, savory pudding of artichokes, garlic and olive oil. It's rich enough to make beurre blanc cower and flavorful enough to shame a truffle.</p>

        <p>But this little jar of artichoke and garlic sauce, made by Gran Cucina in the Piedmont region of Italy, will send those without preconceptions into a frenzy. It is a silk-smooth, savory pudding of artichokes, garlic and olive oil. It's rich enough to make beurre blanc cower and flavorful enough to shame a truffle.</p>
        <p>Think of it as aioli without the egg, artichoke puree without any stringiness, and both without the work. You simply loosen the cap, boil some spaghetti in salty water and toss in a few spoonfuls of the sauce. It clings to the strands like a cream sauce and does not separate; the heat and salt underline its pure flavors.</p>
        <p>This is just a warm-up. Try it with pasta of any shape, stirring in some chopped tarragon, a pinch of grated lemon zest, a handful of peas. Spread it on thick pieces of toasted country bread, sprinkled with a little more oil and bits of sea salt. Use it in place of mayonnaise in potato salad. Dab it on boiled eggs. Layer it between lettuce and roasted chicken in a sandwich.</p>
        <p>Just one request: try to restrain yourself from eating it by the spoonful.</p>
