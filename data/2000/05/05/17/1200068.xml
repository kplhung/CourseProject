        <p>New Brasserie District</p>
        <p>Big brasserie-style restaurants are moving onto West 57th Street. Rue 57 holds down the southeast corner at Avenue of the Americas, and now Shelly's New York has opened at 104 West 57th Street, in the Art Deco building that was the Motown Cafe. It has 300 seats on two levels. Seafood dominates, but there are touches of nostalgia like chicken chow mein.</p>
        <p>Soon to come are 8 1/2, near Fifth Avenue, and Central Park Grill, on the northwest corner of Avenue of the Americas, where Wolf's Delicatessen used to be.</p>
        <p>Some Shifts on Seventh</p>
        <p>Night Sky, a restaurant that was planned for the 50th floor of the Equitable Tower at 787 Seventh Avenue (51st Street) has been canceled. David Emil, whose company, Night Sky, was to develop it, said the owners wanted the space for offices.</p>
        <p>Mr. Emil's company has found a partner for the space on East 49th Street that housed Blackbird. It will be a kosher steakhouse.</p>
        <p>In another change in the Equitable Tower, Palio has been sold to Turin Hotels International, which is bringing in chefs from Savini, its restaurant in Milan. A makeover designed by Adam Tihany is planned.</p>
        <p>Revamp in the Works</p>
        <p>Sandro Fioriti has taken over Siena, 200 Ninth Avenue (22nd Street), with Adolfo Magnifico, Siena's manager. They plan to rename it Sandro's. Mr. Fioriti once had a restaurant by that name on East 59th Street.</p>
        <p>Siena had previously been Luma, with a less Italian focus. One of Siena's previous owners, Gino Diaferia, said Siena had become ''just a neighborhood place'' and was not doing enough business.</p>
        <p>Short Orders</p>
        <p>Alain Ducasse is moving his restaurant in Paris from the Parc hotel to the Plaza Athenee. The new place won't open until the fall. Mr. Ducasse's New York restaurant is to open in June.</p>
        <p>As announced last winter, Ratner's, the 95-year-old kosher dairy restaurant at 138 Delancey Street (Norfolk Street), will close for renovations on June 5.</p>
        <p>When it reopens, around Labor Day, it will be smaller, will be open only for lunch and will no longer be kosher.</p>
