        <p>Since the French Revolution, France has remodeled its Constitution four times. Now it looks as if the Fifth Republic, 42 years old, may soon be refashioned too.</p>
        <p>A proposal to cut the president's term of office to five years from seven is gaining support from political leaders on both the right and the left. The idea has been put forward many times before but has died in one political tangle or another. But this time it looks as if political interests may increase its chances.</p>
        <p>The proposed change became a hot topic last week when former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing introduced a bill in Parliament calling for a shorter presidential term whose length would coincide with that of the National Assembly.</p>
        <p>In the past, France's Gaullist president, Jacques Chirac, has quickly dismissed any need for modernizing the Constitution, saying the current political system works just fine. But with his age creeping up on him, Mr.  Chirac, who wants to run again in 2002 when he would turn 70, has apparently indicated to his aides that he might be changing his mind.</p>
        <p>A shorter term, most experts agree, would make Mr. Chirac's age less of an issue in the next election.  His chief political rival, Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, a Socialist who will probably face Mr. Chirac in the presidential election, may not be eager to give Mr. Chirac an advantage. But he has called for a five-year term so many times in the past that he has little choice but to go along now.</p>
        <p>A five-year presidency would be a major change in the dynamics of French politics. Supporters have long argued that the seven-year term, introduced by de Gaulle in an effort to stabilize the government after years of a volatile parliamentary system, is just too long in a fast-changing world.</p>
        <p>But others hope that it will also avoid awkward periods of ''cohabitation,'' like the one France is experiencing now, with the president and the prime minister belonging to different parties and working, often, at cross purposes.</p>
        <p>In the last few decades, that situation has come up several times. Two or three years after electing a president, French voters, sometimes registering disappointment with his performance, elect a parliamentary majority from another party, destroying the lines of authority that de Gaulle had in mind. But that would be far less likely to happen if the elections for the presidency and Parliament occurred at the same time.</p>
        <p>Opinion polls have found wide support for a five-year term, which is the most common term length for elected leaders in Europe. One recent poll found that 78 percent supported the idea.</p>
        <p>In Parliament today, Mr. Jospin said he would be glad to support the idea, now that key members of Mr. Chirac's Rally For the Republic party, including its leader, Michele Alliot-Marie, had come out in support.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jospin, who had proposed a five-year term in 1995 and again in 1997, said he had stopped talking about it since then because in his position doing so would be seen as an aggressive political act.</p>
        <p>''Today,'' he said, ''I am told that the situation is changed and that an accord can be reached. Therefore, I will of course confirm to you that I support this effort.''</p>
        <p>The Constitution can be amended by either a vote in both houses of Parliament or a referendum. With both parties behind the effort, a new proposal now is seen as having its best chance to pass since 1973, when President Georges Pompidou brought such a measure before Parliament; it failed to get enough votes.</p>
        <p>The newspaper Le Monde reported today that Mr. Chirac has been seeing jurists and politicians all week trying to sound them out on the idea.</p>
        <p>Discussions apparently center on holding a referendum in the fall of 2001.</p>
