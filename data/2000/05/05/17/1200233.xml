        <p>Rickey Henderson made his second appearance in the Mets' clubhouse since the team released him on Saturday, saying he had returned to collect his equipment and belongings. It was bizarre to see Henderson walking around the clubhouse two hours before the Mets played the Rockies last night.</p>
        <p>If he is not claimed by today, a highly unlikely prospect, teams can start negotiating with the 41-year-old outfielder.</p>
        <p>''I don't know nothing about nothing,'' said Henderson, when he was asked if he would like to play for the Yankees. ''They ain't told me nothing. They told me to wait until tomorrow. You just take it easy, Rickey. Life has been beautiful.''</p>
        <p>When Manager Bobby Valentine was asked if he had a problem with Henderson's visit three days after he was released, Valentine said: ''I guess he came back for his check. I guess he liked it here.''</p>
        <p>But Valentine later added that he had spoken with Henderson on Sunday and that Henderson ''understood'' what the Mets were doing and viewed the release as a ''good opportunity'' for him.</p>
        <p>Fred Wilpon, the Mets' president, said Henderson's release went beyond his failure to run hard when he drilled a ball off the left-field fence last Friday.</p>
        <p>''I just think it was a series of things,'' he said. ''It wasn't just that ball on Friday night. I think he left our manager and general manager scratching their heads, too. But that's yesterday's news.''</p>
