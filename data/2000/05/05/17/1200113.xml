        <p>The Corel Corporation of Canada and the Inprise/Borland Corporation of California scrapped their planned merger today only three months after the two software companies announced the all-stock deal, then worth more than $1 billion.</p>
        <p>Corel's steadily eroding share price made the merger untenable, and the company, a leading proponent of the Linux alternative to the Windows operating system, is now examining other ways to strengthen its precarious cash position.</p>
        <p>Michael C. J. Cowpland, chief executive and founder of Corel, based in Ottawa, attributed the aborted deal to ''significant market changes.'' Since the merger was announced on Feb. 7, Corel shares, on Nasdaq, have dropped 73 percent on unexpectedly poor financial results and skepticism about Corel's ability to profit from Linux applications. Today, Corel shares rose 11 percent, to $6. Inprise/Borland shares rose 4.8 percent, to $6.125.</p>
        <p>But unless Corel's financial health improves, and the development of its Linux system shows signs of producing profit, the few securities analysts who still follow Corel expect its stock price -- which peaked at $44.50 early this year -- to drift lower.</p>
        <p>The collapse of the merger plan was not considered a surprise. As Corel shares weakened, Inprise/Borland holders grew increasingly upset at the prospect of trading each of their shares for 0.75 a Corel share, as originally agreed. Two groups sued Inprise/Borland to block the deal, and the company hired an investment bank, Broadview International, to evaluate the merger terms.</p>
        <p>Broadview's report is believed to have killed the agreement, and Inprise/Borland, which is based in Scotts Valley, Calif., is not required to pay the $30 million breakup fee that had been written into the pact. The probable reason, some analysts said, was that Corel's deteriorating financial health, disclosed soon after the merger announcement, was as big a shock to Inprise/Borland as it was to other investors.</p>
        <p>Corel reported an operating loss of $18.8 million for the first quarter -- twice what analysts had expected -- and warned that results for the next two quarters would be no better. In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company said it would run out of operating cash by the summer if the merger failed or if alternative financing could not be found.</p>
        <p>Corel officials said today that they were evaluating several offers but  refused to say whether a cash injection would likely come from selling debt or equity or from selling the entire company. A plan to cut costs by $40 million a year is also to be adopted, but no details were given.</p>
