        <p>An association of New York City judges is criticizing an attempt by the state's chief administrative judge to curtail political patronage in the court system.</p>
        <p>In a March memorandum, and again in a letter dated Monday, Jonathan Lippman, the state's chief administrative judge, told state judges that the law required them to more closely supervise the receivers they appoint to oversee bankrupt or mismanaged businesses and property.</p>
        <p>Judge Lippman wants state judges to approve the hiring of lawyers, real estate managers and other professionals by receivers. Although such oversight is not routine, the judge has argued it would help ensure that  receivers' hiring practices are based  on merit, not on political favoritism or nepotism.</p>
        <p>Judges who ignore Judge Lippman's interpretation of the rules could face censure by the Commission on Judicial Conduct.</p>
        <p>The Association of Justices of New York City opposes the change, arguing that such close observation runs counter to current practices, would undermine the entire purpose of appointing a receiver and would overly burden the court system.</p>
        <p>Judge Lippman's memorandum follows a promise by the state's top judge, Judith S. Kaye, to rein in patronage. Earlier this year Judge Kaye appointed a special investigator to study accusations that judges favor lawyers with strong political ties when granting court receiverships. Judge Kaye also appointed a commission to consider changes to the rules governing how receivers are appointed.</p>
        <p>The most recent battles over patronage stem from oversight of the Cypress Hills Cemetery in Brooklyn. Calls for restraining patronage arose after two Democratic loyalists, Thomas J. Garry and Arnold J. Ludwig, sent a letter last December to 40 party officials, complaining that a fellow lawyer excluded them from a sizable court-awarded assignment despite their fidelity to the party.</p>
        <p>Court critics say that receivers have long been a source of political patronage. Although receivers cannot be relatives of judges or get more than one appointment a year, under current practice those restrictions do not apply to the lawyers and other professionals they hire.</p>
        <p>Barbara Reed, associate director of the Fund for Modern Courts, a watchdog group, said she enthusiastically supported Judge Lippman's memorandum and hoped it would be followed. ''The fact that it stirred up such a ruckus shows there is still a problem,'' Ms. Reed said.</p>
        <p>Through a spokesman, Judge Lippman said he would not comment on his internal memorandum. But in it and in letters to judges, Judge Lippman has said he was moving to  end requests to use court appointments as political favors and reel in the power of receivers.</p>
        <p>One of the justices, Edward H. Lehner, said in a March 22 letter to Judge Lippman that while a literal interpretation of judicial rules might support such close oversight of receivers, it would run contrary to current practice. He also argued that the court would be foisting lawyers on receivers who should have the right to hire their own counsel.</p>
        <p>Justice Lehner argued the problem of favoritism could be eliminated merely by enacting new restrictions on whom receivers hire. In an interview yesterday, he said Judge Lippman's changes could actually increase the patronage power of judges.</p>
        <p>''It's not a matter of defending patronage,'' Justice Lehner said. ''It will just give the judges more patronage. They will have to make all these other appointments we are not capable of making.''</p>
        <p>The Association of Justices of New York City sent its own memorandum in April to Judge Lippman, arguing that requiring such judicial oversight would require the courts to micromanage receivers. The New York Law Journal first reported the association's April letter last week.</p>
        <p>Justice Edward M. Rappaport, the association's president, did not return a call seeking comment.</p>
        <p>In his May 15 letter to Justice Rappaport, Judge Lippman said he was not asking judges to micromanage the courts, but only to force the courts to oversee the most significant and lucrative contracts.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 18, 2000, Thursday  An article yesterday about a March memorandum to state judges from New York's chief administrative judge, Jonathan Lippman, on political patronage in the court system referred incorrectly in some copies to the publication that first reported on a response sent to the judge last month by the Association of Justices of New York City. It is The New York Law Journal, not The New York Law Review.</p>
