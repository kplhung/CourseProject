        <p>THE balance has shifted significantly again in the airline industry's carry-on bag wars. Delta Air Lines, the world's largest carrier, is retrofitting overhead bins in most of its airplanes to allow more storage for passengers' carry-on bags.</p>
        <p>Last year, Continental Airlines defied the industry trend toward tighter storage and stingier allowances for carry-on bags when it completed a $20 million project to enlarge overhead bins in its entire fleet. As some competitors grumbled and the major flight attendants union asked the federal government to limit passengers to a single carry-on bag, Continental loudly proclaimed that its customers were welcome to bring on a reasonable amount of carry-on baggage -- even more than two, provided space was available.  Earlier this year, Delta put some of its aircraft through a three-month trial with bigger overhead bins allowing for more carry-on bags. The results were conclusive, said Vicki Escarra, Delta's executive vice president for customer service.</p>

        <p>THE balance has shifted significantly again in the airline industry's carry-on bag wars. Delta Air Lines, the world's largest carrier, is retrofitting overhead bins in most of its airplanes to allow more storage for passengers' carry-on bags.</p>
        <p>Last year, Continental Airlines defied the industry trend toward tighter storage and stingier allowances for carry-on bags when it completed a $20 million project to enlarge overhead bins in its entire fleet. As some competitors grumbled and the major flight attendants union asked the federal government to limit passengers to a single carry-on bag, Continental loudly proclaimed that its customers were welcome to bring on a reasonable amount of carry-on baggage -- even more than two, provided space was available.  Earlier this year, Delta put some of its aircraft through a three-month trial with bigger overhead bins allowing for more carry-on bags. The results were conclusive, said Vicki Escarra, Delta's executive vice president for customer service.</p>
        <p>''We found that it helped us to board the airplane about five to eight minutes faster,'' she said. That's because people become seated more quickly when they -- and flight attendants -- are not struggling and sometimes battling over carry-on bags and limited space.</p>
        <p>Delta has now redesigned overhead bins to accommodate more carry-on bags on about 10 percent of its long-range 757's and medium-range MD-88 planes. Within nine months, the carrier hopes to have more spacious overhead bins in about 240 of those planes, which are the workhorses of its fleet. In all, about 80 percent of the Delta fleet will have bigger carry-on bins.</p>
        <p>Saving time is the main reason for this and other changes in Delta's approach to boarding airplanes, said Ms. Escarra. In the last year, she said, ''we've made a huge investment, close to a billion dollars on improving airport technology,'' installing electronic check-in kiosks and other services to reduce lines at airports. That done, Delta turned its attention to carry-on storage and decided to follow Continental's lead, although Delta will still enforce a two-bag limit for carry-ons.</p>
        <p>Ms. Escarra said of the trial run, ''I thought we'd get some improvement in boarding times and on-time departure, but didn't expect it in the seven-  to eight-minute range.'' That, in addition to a substantial improvement in boarding times thanks to the new airport gate technology, is a direct appeal to business travelers. ''When you talk to business travelers about what is important to them, 80-90 percent will tell you, being on time," she said.</p>
        <p>She said Delta agreed with Continental on overhead storage and the need to reduce boarding time. ''The strategies are very much the same, although they have not made nearly the investments that we have around improvements in technology.''</p>
        <p>Continental declined to comment -- much -- on Delta's move. ''What is it they say, imitation is the most sincere form of flattery?'' said Michele Treacy, a spokeswoman for Continental, who reiterated the airline's position on carry-ons: ''Our customers should be able to bring on what they want, within reason. Our customers don't want to be told the size of the bag they can bring on -- or how many.''</p>
        <p>The average business traveler made 21 trips last year and stayed 48 nights in hotels, according to the 1999 OAG Worldwide Business Travel Lifestyle Survey. Both averages are up from the year before. International business travel is also increasing, the OAG says.</p>
        <p>Focusing on the growth in international travel, and aware of how frustrating using a phone in a foreign country can be for those who need to stay in touch with the office or with far-flung customers facing what it politely refers to as ''local communications roadblocks,'' Sprint recently introduced a service called Sprint Business Traveler, which provides customers with phone card, personal conferencing, global dialing and Internet, e-mail, voice-mail and other features that work in 125 countries. Customers get a small leather carrying case that holds 13 assorted phone adapters to use with a wide variety of foreign systems.</p>
        <p>Looking at the same trends, Avis just added four more countries -- Latvia, Estonia, Morocco and Syria -- to its toll-free ''On Call'' service that links car renters in 25 countries to a United States-based Avis agent 24 hours a day. The agents are trained to help unsnag travel obstacles of all kinds and can also do things like help customers find medical services while abroad.</p>
        <p>Finally, a use for turbulence: Passengers on some United Airlines flights out of O'Hare Airport in Chicago get a new lunch item in United's economy and economy-plus seats -- a McDonald's Chicken Caesar McSalad Shaker. The chicken and greens come in a tall lidded plastic cup to which you add salad dressing. Then you shake it yourself. The promotion -- which has some United flight attendants worried that assembling salads for baffled passengers will become another inflight chore -- ends June 7.</p>
        <p>More women are traveling on business -- and they're more likely to fly in steerage than males. That's one of the findings in the latest Runzheimer Reports on Travel Management, an industry newsletter that surveys corporate travel managers. Among other findings: Women, who now make up about 25 percent of all business travelers, are most cost-conscious on the road, even though they're on the employer's nickel. Also, women chose hotels with greater care for safety and proximity to their destination, and tend to make their arrangements further in advance.</p>
