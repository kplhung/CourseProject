        <p>WHEN you first walk into M. Kabram &amp; Sons on the Bowery, it seems like every other place on the street, a wreck of stainless-steel kitchen equipment spilling out onto the sidewalk. But it is so much more. Stacked, piled and wedged in the aged bones of this seven-story building is an astonishing archive of vintage American restaurant equipment.</p>
        <p>Lloyd Kabram, the owner, rents the equipment out as props for movies and television. ''That's our counter, our cups and saucers,'' said Mr. Kabram, nodding toward a framed black and white photograph of the cast of ''The Honeymooners'' leaning over a diner counter. On another floor, he pointed to an old pizza oven. ''That's the one from 'Goodfellas,' '' he said, ''when the guy gets his head stuck inside the door.''</p>

        <p>WHEN you first walk into M. Kabram &amp; Sons on the Bowery, it seems like every other place on the street, a wreck of stainless-steel kitchen equipment spilling out onto the sidewalk. But it is so much more. Stacked, piled and wedged in the aged bones of this seven-story building is an astonishing archive of vintage American restaurant equipment.</p>
        <p>Lloyd Kabram, the owner, rents the equipment out as props for movies and television. ''That's our counter, our cups and saucers,'' said Mr. Kabram, nodding toward a framed black and white photograph of the cast of ''The Honeymooners'' leaning over a diner counter. On another floor, he pointed to an old pizza oven. ''That's the one from 'Goodfellas,' '' he said, ''when the guy gets his head stuck inside the door.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kabram treats the equipment like family heirlooms. His father and two uncles started the business in 1920 but didn't begin renting the stock until the 50's. He has worked there for 27 years. The collection grew out of economy. When a diner or pizza shop closed, Kabram would buy its contents, which was cheaper than buying individual items.</p>
        <p>''You would go down to the basement and it would all be there,'' Mr. Kabram said of the treasures he and his family found. ''If it was the 1970's, it would be filled with everything from the 1960's and 1950's.'' They would resell what they could;  the rest, from malted-milk machines to refrigerators, they would rent.</p>
        <p>Now, in vast rooms with uneven floors, musty air and dim light is a crammed, vintage playground. There are cake stands on top of cigar cases; shelf upon shelf of napkin dispensers; bars in all shapes and sizes; diner stools from every decade; saltshakers lined up in rows like toy soldiers; candy jars and coffee urns; meathooks and Coca-Cola machines; chrome-edged diner tables in bright green, blue and red, stacked like dominos; and countless other finds, all worn and beautiful.</p>
        <p>Since most of the equipment does not work, it is nothing the average person would want to rent, but it's worth looking at. Some of the equipment is on the first floor. For the rest, go early in the day, and if it's quiet and you're friendly, Mr. Kabram may take you up on the old Otis elevator for a tour.</p>
