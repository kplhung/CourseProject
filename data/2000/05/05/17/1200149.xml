        <p>Dominicans turned out in large numbers on Tuesday to elect a president -- either one who would build on the current government's policy of economic liberalization or one who wants to reconsider some of the changes to help the poor and rural residents who say the boom years have overlooked them.</p>
        <p>While this Caribbean nation has enjoyed four years of robust and unprecedented growth, dissatisfaction among the poor has been great enough to drive the candidacy of Hipolito Mejia of the left-leaning Dominican Revolutionary Party.

        <p>Dominicans turned out in large numbers on Tuesday to elect a president -- either one who would build on the current government's policy of economic liberalization or one who wants to reconsider some of the changes to help the poor and rural residents who say the boom years have overlooked them.</p>
        <p>While this Caribbean nation has enjoyed four years of robust and unprecedented growth, dissatisfaction among the poor has been great enough to drive the candidacy of Hipolito Mejia of the left-leaning Dominican Revolutionary Party. Mr. Mejia, an agronomist and businessman who was a cabinet official in the 1970's, has campaigned on a platform of increased social spending, aid to farmers and a reassessment of the current government's privatization policies. Preliminary results based on 27.7 percent of the polling places were giving him 49 percent of the vote early this morning.</p>
        <p>But the same sentiment has also propelled the unlikely candidacy of former President Joaquin Balaguer, who is seeking his eighth term in office. Mr. Balaguer, an autocrat who was close to the dictator Rafael Trujillo, is 93 and blind. In his infrequent stump speeches, he has had to be helped to the podium by aides.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, his Social Christian Reformist Party was garnering 26.7 percent of the vote. The third main candidate, Danilo Medina of the governing centrist Dominican Liberation Party, known as the P.L.D., has vowed to continue his party's economic policy but with an eye toward having the benefits flow to the neediest sectors of society. This morning, he had 23.6 percent of the vote.</p>
        <p>If no candidate wins a majority, a runoff is scheduled for June 30. While some polling places experienced delays, the vote proceeded without disruptions or conflict.</p>
        <p>The current President, Leonel Fernandez, a lawyer educated in the United States, has been praised by  international groups for having enacted economic changes that have stimulated a growth rate of approximately 8 percent and attracted considerable investment here. Mr. Fernandez, who is prohibited by law from a second consecutive term, also focused on improving transportation and roads.</p>
        <p>''This has been a fairly progressive government by Dominican standards,'' said a diplomat here.</p>
        <p>Supporters of Mr. Medina, who was a top aide to Mr. Fernandez, said the recent economic growth -- which last year made the Dominican Republic's economy the fastest growing in Latin America -- should continue under their party's supervision. They said that the country's stable currency and finances would improve the country's ability to invest in schools and health services.</p>
        <p>''If you want to work, you can work,'' said Idelfonso Cora, as he waited to vote for Mr. Medina. ''I support Danilo because of the growth under the P.L.D. has been the best.</p>
        <p>But the governing party's economic changes and capital projects have not played as well among some poor and rural voters, who feel the initiatives have done little to improve their circumstances. There are continuing complaints about high food prices and a lack of jobs.</p>
        <p>''People still have to get on boats and go to Puerto Rico because there is not enough opportunity here,'' said Samuel Collado, a security guard who was waiting to vote for Mr. Mejia. ''We want a government that will help the poor, not just the rich.''</p>
        <p>He and others have been especially rankled by the government's privatization of state-run sugar and electrical production industries. In  Guerra, about 15 miles outside Santo Domingo, voters said the privatization of the sugar company had a devastating effect on their town.</p>
        <p>''Sugar cane?'' Maria Altagracia Lebron said. ''Don't even talk about that. We used to live from that, but not anymore. There is no cane or anything, because the government privatized it. And who does that favor? The millionaires who have the money.''</p>
        <p>While Mr. Mejia said he would review the privatization policies, he may have no choice but to continue, a diplomat said, because he is also enough of a businessman to know that it was ultimately the only choice the country had.</p>
        <p>In some respects, both he and Mr. Medina tout similar promises of helping those who have been left out.</p>
        <p>''This is about personality,'' a diplomat said. ''There is also a more direct connection between the parties and the people. The concept that one candidate might do good for the whole nation is alien. It's what can you do for me?''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the master of that retail political strategy has been Mr. Balaguer, who has honed it over decades, dispensing jobs, food and favors.  ''The people who support him got things -- a job, a school or a building,'' a diplomat said. ''I also think there is some sort of nostalgia for the caudillo, the strong leader. They feel they want a society where they do not have much chaos.''</p>
        <p>The campaign season was seen by many as among the most tranquil in years. Nonetheless, there were disquieting incidents of violence.</p>
        <p>In late April, two supporters of the governing party were shot and killed by Mr. Mejia's bodyguards during a campaign swing in the town of Moca. Although the bodyguards said the two were suspected of planning to attack Mr. Mejia, the police dismissed that motive. Several suspects were arrested.</p>
        <p>And recalling the violence that racked this nation during Mr. Balaguer's rule, the family of a journalist who was killed by a death squad linked to the military in 1975 tried to block Mr. Balaguer's candidacy, accusing him of complicity. The Central Electoral Council declined to pursue the case, saying there was not enough evidence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Balaguer's supporters, in turn, accused the governing party of plotting to assassinate him, saying that his age and frail physical condition made him vulnerable.</p>
        <p>Mr. Balaguer could still be in a position to exercise influence should his party come in second in the vote. It is expected that Mr. Mejia could face a challenge from a united front forged by his two opponents. At the same time, Mr. Mejia's supporters say their candidate's strength among the poor and rural voters has not been reflected in the polls.</p>
        <p>''He is a good candidate,'' said Alfonso Bolque Brito, a street vendor. ''He is the only one who can put food in the mouths of those who are unhappy.''</p>
