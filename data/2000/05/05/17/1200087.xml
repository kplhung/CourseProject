        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A May 14 letter writer says the term ''reproductive rights'' as used  by the Center for Reproductive Law and Policy means the right to choose abortion. Our view of reproductive rights is more comprehensive.</p>
        <p>These rights include the right to decide on the number, spacing and timing of one's children and to have the information, education and means to do so. These rights entail services related to family planning, maternal health, treatment of H.I.V.-AIDS and sexually transmitted infections, infertility and reproductive cancers. Reproductive rights also include the right to a safe and legal abortion.</p>

        <p>Women want to make decisions about reproduction free of discrimination, coercion and violence. Women's organizations in all countries of the world are tirelessly fighting for this.</p>
