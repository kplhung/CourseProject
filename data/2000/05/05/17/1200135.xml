        <p>The Clinton administration will oppose the first World Bank loans offered to Iran in seven years, even though Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright declared some easing of sanctions recently, officials said today.</p>
        <p>The $232 million loans for a sewage system in Teheran and basic health facilities are set for a vote on Thursday at the bank, and will likely be approved by the 24-member executive board, despite lobbying by the United States of its European allies, American officials said.</p>
        <p>The United States, which has successfully delayed the vote twice, is opposing the loan on two grounds.</p>
        <p>First, the law mandates that the United States vote against World Bank loans to countries on the State Department's list of states that sponsor terrorism; Iran is one of seven countries on the list.</p>
        <p>Second, administration officials said that awarding Iran with World Bank loans was inappropriate at a time when the government in Tehran was holding a closed-door espionage trial of 13 Jewish men. One of the men was shown by the government on television earlier this month publicly confessing to the charges without his attorney.</p>
        <p>How to deal with the issue of the loans -- which advocates see as assisting ordinary Iranians -- represents the tricky nature of the administration's efforts to improve relations with Iran.</p>
        <p>In a speech in March, Dr. Albright said that the United States did not want to penalize ''innocent civilians'' in Iran with its sanctions, and that Washington must bear some of the responsibility for the poor state of relations between Iran and the United States.</p>
        <p>Today, administration officials said this did not mean unfettered progress in improving those relations. ''We think it is inappropriate to grant the loan while the trial is going on,'' a senior official said. ''We think it is best to postpone the loan.''</p>
        <p>Efforts continued today to persuade the president of the World Bank, James Wolfensohn, to postpone the vote for a third time, administration officials said. But bank officials said the vote was set to go ahead.</p>
        <p>In some small steps last year, President Clinton eased economic sanctions against Iran by allowing the export of food, medicine and medical equipment, and authorizing the sale of spare parts for Iran's aging Boeing passenger aircraft.</p>
        <p>One of the purposes of the new policies, Dr. Albright said, was to show the Iranian people that the ''the United States bears them no ill will.''</p>
        <p>In the last week, Dr. Albright has tried to persuade European foreign ministers to vote against the loan or seek a delay -- in particular the French foreign minister, Hubert Vedrine, and the German foreign minister, Joschka Fischer, who were in Washington, her aides said.</p>
        <p>The British government supports the loans, believing they are designed to alleviate poverty and finance fiscally sound projects, officials said.</p>
