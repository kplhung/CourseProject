        <p>Last weekend Austin, Minn., a pleasant, if not exactly mythical city of 22,000, two hours south of here, had a visit from a number of sprites, fairies, gods and foolish Athenians, as the Guthrie Theater's traveling production of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' ensconced itself in the high school auditorium.</p>
        <p>It was the penultimate stop on a 17-city tour through the northern Midwest, the first time the Minneapolis-based Guthrie, one of the nation's most prominent regional theaters, had toured a show since the mid-1980's, when funds from the National Endowment for the Arts dried up. It provided a rare opportunity for Austin, which proudly declares itself Spamtown U.S.A., a homage to its leading corporate citizen, Hormel Foods. And the locals took advantage; nearly a quarter of Austin's population attended the four performances.</p>
        <p>The production, staged by the Guthrie's artistic director, Joe Dowling, and featuring a number of young actors the Guthrie has developed in its summertime pre-professional program, was no skimpy road show. It was a three-hour extravaganza, full of inviting theatrics: colorful sets, gaudily witty costumes, lighting wizardry, gymnastic choreography, Shakespearean verse set to doo-wop and disco music, and not least, in a broad satire that no one in Austin (or anyone who has seen the film ''Fargo'') could fail to appreciate, the commoner craftsmen, Shakespeare's goofy, would-be thespians, done up as dimwitted Minnesotans.</p>
        <p>O.K, it wouldn't have played so well at Lincoln Center. The acting was uneven -- a lot of youthful overenthusiasm there -- and the overall concept, which placed the denizens of Theseus' palace in modern dress and the denizens of the forest in outfits that would have made them comfortable in the ''Star Wars'' wookie bar, took ''anything goes'' as its through line. Most egregiously, the ''Pyramus and Thisbe'' skit was milked for far too much slapstick and for far too long. But at least two young performers, Cheyenne Casebier as Helena and Randy Reyes as Puck, had the glow of genuine talent, and Shawn Hamilton, an experienced actor in regional theater, provided authoritative ballast as Theseus and Oberon.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dowling has a gift for moving actors effectively around the stage, and his purpose in emptying his substantial bag of tricks was wonderfully achieved: to make the theater a place of welcome, with Shakespeare the friendly host and teacher. It would be hard to imagine better theater in a high school auditorium. And to judge from the lusty standing ovation at the end of Friday night's show, it was much appreciated. Indeed, the show's reception in Austin couldn't have been a more timely demonstration of popular support for the Guthrie, whose ambition is currently both on display and at issue.</p>
        <p>Best known for its full-throttle productions of classics in its home theater -- its current show, ''The Plough and the Stars'' by Sean O'Casey, is exemplary -- the Guthrie, founded in 1963, has, since Mr. Dowling arrived in 1996, reached high-water marks, with more than 32,000 current subscribers and nearly $50 million in endowment, making it one of the nation's healthiest theater companies. But it has been restricted by its building, which is attached to the Walker Art Center and has only one performance space, a 1,300-seat auditorium with a thrust stage. It has been unable to compete in the ever more necessary enterprise of developing new work, and its lack of a proscenium stage has limited its ability to transfer shows to commercial houses or engage in co-productions with other regional companies.</p>
        <p>Plans for a new, three-theater building have been in the works for several years. Now the search is about to begin for an architect for a site on the banks of the Mississippi in Minneapolis that had once been considered by the city for a new baseball stadium. But for months the Guthrie has been the focus of a political debate over whether the public should help pay for a project estimated at $100 million.</p>
        <p>The Guthrie expects to complete the building for the 2004-2005 season, with or without government money. But its initial request to the state for $25 million was whittled down by legislators wary of Gov. Jesse Ventura's antipathy toward government spending on the arts and by newspaper polls that indicated public opinion was uncertain about whether the Guthrie, a nonprofit institution, was of statewide value -- more worthy than, say, a private enterprise like the Minnesota Twins -- or merely a crown for the arts-rich Twin Cities. A bonding bill that would have provided the Guthrie with $3 million in state funds was delivered to Governor Ventura by legislators on Friday. [He struck that provision in a line-item veto on Monday; a legislative override is still possible.]</p>
        <p>It's an odd position for an arts institution to be arguing for itself in the political arena. But Mr. Dowling, an Irishman who is a former artistic director of the Abbey Theater in Dublin, admits to an obsession with politics; he and his wife have applied for citizenship, he said, in the hope of voting in November. He has been busy with the Guthrie's own campaign lately, pointing out, in interviews, meetings with legislators and letters to the editor, the economic benefits to the state from the construction project and noting that 100,000 children attended Guthrie performances free or with privately subsidized tickets last year.</p>
        <p>Governor Ventura has never been to the Guthrie for a performance; he's not a theater guy, though there is a musical in the works based on his life as a wrestler turned populist politician, a production of which, Mr. Dowling joked, might help the Guthrie in its fund drive. Had the governor attended over the weekend -- he was fishing -- he would have seen what Mr. Dowling has been up to in his spare time, directing ''The Plough and the Stars,'' O'Casey's  portrait, both acrid and affectionate, of Dublin's working class during the turbulent days of the failed citizens' revolt of 1916 against the ruling British, known as the Easter Rising.</p>
        <p>Viewing ''Midsummer'' and ''Plough'' on consecutive nights, one gets a sense of Mr. Dowling's expansive notion of theater as well as his directorial style. The set for ''Plough,'' by Mr. Dowling's longtime collaborator, Frank Hallinan Flood (he also designed ''Midsummer''), is magnificent, a sooty brick tenement front stretching across the back of the thrust stage, with windows lighted and laundry dangling on clotheslines.</p>
        <p>An archway between the two wings of the tenement forms a proscenium of sorts, beneath which actors enter from the surrounding Dublin neighborhood in some scenes; for others, whole interior sets -- two apartments and a barroom -- emerge from it on rollers. Behind it the revolt itself, which fills the play's second half, is replete with the light and sound of gunfire, as though a Hollywood movie were being shot just out of view. Mr. Dowling is not stingy with effects.</p>
        <p>O'Casey's tenement is aswarm with neighborly conflict, both personal and political, already simmering in poverty and ready to boil in the crucible of imminent revolution. In scene after scene Mr. Dowling sets his large cast -- there are nine principal roles and a substantial company -- in perpetual motion. They dance, threaten, fight, embrace, rally round the flag -- or flags, since one character, has a son serving the crown in World War I -- as their loyalties to one another shift in an increasingly violent milieu.</p>
        <p>The cast, alas, is uneven, many with a tenuous hold on the Irish accent that gives a particular poignancy to O'Casey's characteristic poetics. (The contemporary playwright that comes closest to O'Casey's vernacular music of a particular time and place is August Wilson.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Dowling has emphasized the hardness of these people, the beleaguered quality that makes them prone to aggravated selfishness, and as a result the American actors often miss the aching romanticism that lies moribund in them but not dead. This is particularly true of Michelle O'Neill and Lee Mark Nelson as Mary and Jack Clitheroe, the young married couple whose once-enviable romance has withered with the rise of Jack's call to patriotism. A climactic tug of war -- when a pleading and pregnant Mary tries to pull Jack away from a wounded comrade -- is staged to squeeze the heart, but the actors don't seem as agonized as they do argumentative.</p>
        <p>Happily the show is anchored by the weight of real Irish -- Milo O'Shea as the carpenter Fluther Good, whose live-and-let-drink approach to life has hardened into a sad and self-deluding pride, and the superb Rosaleen Linehan as Bessie Burgess, a bitterly lonesome British loyalist whose humanity is forced to the surface when the revolution visits her living room.</p>
        <p>In the production's most affecting scenes, each takes command. Just before intermission Mr. Dowling stages a barroom waltz between Fluther and the prostitute Rosie Redmond (a stirring character turn by Derdriu Ring), which wends its way into the street into the last moments of a political rally that has been commandeered by a demagogue's call to arms. The drunken dancers, unsuited to each other except out of fear and loneliness, twirl obliviously about Jack Clitheroe, whose face is fixed in soldierly anger. Mr. O'Shea's yearning for a private peace brings the lights down with a sweet dream that is clearly a portent of doom.</p>
        <p>At the end of the play, when that doom finds Bessie in her own home,  O'Casey's tragedy is complete. She bleeds from a gunshot, calling out for help to Mary, who has gone mad; it is a moment of purposefully high melodrama. Ms. Linehan conjures Bessie's death, not with dignity or fear but with sadness and resentment, understanding that she, a worthy woman, is a victim of senselessness. It's a sensational sequence that highlights an actor's probing and craft, a textbook example of subtle thinking and precise performance that makes an audience feel, snapping down the benevolent jaws of the theatrical trap. And that, after all, is what Mr. Dowling and the Guthrie wish to accomplish.</p>
