        <p>WFAN abruptly dismissed its midday team of Russ Salzberg and Steve Somers yesterday and will replace the duo today with Suzyn Waldman and Jody McDonald.</p>
        <p>Salzberg ad Somers knew of rumors about their future in the 10 a.m.-to-1 p.m. time slot, but they were surprised by the suddenness of the station's decision. They did their final show and were informed of their dismissal afterward.</p>
        <p>WFAN issued a statement announcing the hiring of Waldman and McDonald for the show, but did not mention Salzberg and Somers, who were a team for five years. Their biographies were removed from WFAN's Web site. Somers is considering an offer to remain with the station.</p>
        <p>Salzberg and Somers said they did not know if ratings alone, which have always been a problem in the midday slot between the shows hosted by Don Imus in the morning program and by Mike Francesa and Chris Russo in the late afternoon, doomed their show.</p>
        <p>Waldman, who will continue for at least this season as the station's Yankees reporter, was the first voice heard on WFAN when it was launched in July 1987. McDonald was part of the original WFAN corps of announcers, left for WIP, Philadelphia's sports-talk radio station, and returned to WFAN last year. He has mostly served WFAN as a weekend host or a fill-in.</p>
