        <p>Convinced that America can't get enough of Regis Philbin, ABC announced a fall prime-time schedule yesterday that will expand the network's hit game show franchise ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' to four nights a week from three.</p>
        <p>With ''Millionaire'' occupying a total of four hours, ABC will add only four shows to its lineup -- one drama and three comedies -- one of the smallest lists of new series in recent television history. No show has ever run four nights in prime time. ''Millionaire'' has been the most potent new program on television since the entry of ''E.R.'' six years ago.</p>

        <p>Convinced that America can't get enough of Regis Philbin, ABC announced a fall prime-time schedule yesterday that will expand the network's hit game show franchise ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' to four nights a week from three.</p>
        <p>With ''Millionaire'' occupying a total of four hours, ABC will add only four shows to its lineup -- one drama and three comedies -- one of the smallest lists of new series in recent television history. No show has ever run four nights in prime time. ''Millionaire'' has been the most potent new program on television since the entry of ''E.R.'' six years ago.</p>
        <p>One comedy not on ABC's list is the widely acclaimed ''Sports Night,'' which ABC canceled after two years on the air. The only hope for its survival would be a pickup from HBO, a deal that is in discussions, an executive involved in the negotiations said yesterday. The deal is said to be very close.</p>
        <p>ABC is also abandoning its effort to transform its news magazine into a single ''20/20'' by bringing back its old ''Prime Time'' title on a Thursday night edition, with Diane Sawyer leaving the ''20/20'' stable to return as anchor of her own show.</p>
        <p>ABC is again holding back ''N.Y.P.D. Blue'' until January, giving the Tuesday-at-10 slot initially to the returning drama ''Once and Again,'' which will go back to Mondays after the football season ends.</p>
        <p>Repeating a pattern set by NBC with its new lineup, which contained five of seven shows that NBC owns,  three of the four new ABC shows are being produced by the Touchstone production studio, run by ABC's parent company, Walt Disney.</p>
        <p>The show getting the most advance notice is ''Gideon's Crossing,'' a drama about a gifted doctor who believes in healing the whole person. The show stars Andre Braugher of ''Homicide'' and is written by that show's original writer, Paul Attanasio.</p>
        <p>Geena Davis will star in a comedy called ''Geena'' -- even though her character is named Teddie -- about a single career woman who marries a widower with a 16-year-old son and 6-year-old daughter. Peter Horton of ''Thirtysomething'' plays the widower.</p>
        <p>Gabriel Byrne, now starring on Broadway in ''Moon for the Misbegotten,'' will move to a sitcom called ''Madigan Men,'' playing a recently divorced New York architect living with his 16-year-old son and his widowed father. The latter is played by Roy Dotrice, who is co-starring with Mr. Byrne on Broadway.</p>
        <p>The final comedy is ''People Who Fear People,'' about two paranoid men, their therapist friend, and the guy next door who is spying on them.</p>
        <p>This is the new ABC schedule:</p>
        <p>MONDAY: ''20/20,'' ''Monday Night Football''</p>
        <p>TUESDAY: ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' ''Dharma and Greg,'' ''Geena,''  ''Once and Again''</p>
        <p>WEDNESDAY: ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' ''The Drew Carey Show,'' ''Spin City,'' ''Gideon's Crossing''</p>
        <p>THURSDAY: ''Who's Line Is It Anyway?,'' ''Who's Line Is It Anyway?'' (repeats), ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' ''Prime Time Thursday''</p>
        <p>FRIDAY: ''Two Guys and a Girl,'' ''People Who Fear People,'' ''Norm,'' ''Madigan Men,'' ''20/20''</p>
        <p>SATURDAY: Movies</p>
        <p>SUNDAY: ''Wonderful World of Disney,'' ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' ''The Practice''</p>
