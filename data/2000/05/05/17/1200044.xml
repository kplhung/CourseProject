        <p>FOR many car buyers, the aroma of a new car can be a deal breaker. New car smell -- an amalgam of odors from the rubber, leather, cloth, plastic and chemicals used in making the car -- can draw buyers to a car the way an animal is drawn to its kin. Or it can turn them off. If the smell reminds them of a wicked aunt's old Buick or gives them the sense that they are losing brain cells from the chemicals, they may change their buying decision.</p>

        <p>FOR many car buyers, the aroma of a new car can be a deal breaker. New car smell -- an amalgam of odors from the rubber, leather, cloth, plastic and chemicals used in making the car -- can draw buyers to a car the way an animal is drawn to its kin. Or it can turn them off. If the smell reminds them of a wicked aunt's old Buick or gives them the sense that they are losing brain cells from the chemicals, they may change their buying decision.</p>
        <p>Which is why manufacturers go to great lengths to cultivate a signature smell. They treat the leather and the upholstery and sometimes add aromas, with luck that the bouquet may spark that sensor in the buyer's nose and send a message to his brain that says, ''Buy.''</p>
        <p>Their work is apparent, as I discovered when I sniffed my way around the 100th New York International Auto Show recently at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center. It took two trips: the air in the center is quite dry, and a warm, moist atmosphere is best for smelling. Still, the aromas were unmistakable. Every car I sniffed had its own  bouquet. Some were seductive, some reminiscent of familiar aromas, some just plain awful.</p>
        <p>TOYOTA ECHO -- Gold exterior, gray upholstery.  A direct hit of fruity perfume underlined by wet dog.</p>
        <p>CHEVROLET MALIBU LS SEDAN -- Navy blue with neutral tan upholstery.  A cross between a sour pickle and a tennis-ball can.</p>
        <p>CADILLAC DE VILLE -- Pearl gray with gray leather interior.  Warm and welcoming, well-balanced fragrance of flowers, berries, leather and wood: much like an old library.</p>
        <p>CADILLAC ELDORADO -- Cherry red with white leather seats.  Like the DeVille, this car has a strange warmth emanating from the white leather, though it smells disconcertingly like a Gruyere cheese omelet.</p>
        <p>BMW 528i -- Ice blue with dark-camel leather interior.  A decadent bouquet of earthy leather, face cream and ripe peaches.</p>
        <p>LAND ROVER DISCOVERY -- Dark green with taupe dimpled-leather interior.  A hint of leather but mostly heady doses of overripe bananas.</p>
        <p>MERCEDES E320 AWD STATION WAGON -- Teal blue with mist-gray leather interior.  The aroma is not warm and fuzzy but has a pleasant bouquet of wet rock and seawater.</p>
        <p>GMC SIERRA -- Black with gray leather interior.  Smells like the first-class section on an old 747; bubble-gum sweet with a vague aroma of food, worn leather and plastic.</p>
        <p>ROLLS-ROYCE SILVER SPUR -- White and sand colored with sand and camel leather seats.  This car smells so intensely of earth, animal and wood you can practically taste it.</p>
        <p>ROLLS-ROYCE SILVER SERAPH -- Silver with gray leather.  The all-leather interior is intoxicating; a combination of seawater, mint and tar. It makes you wonder if your clothes will smell after you get out of the car.</p>
        <p>VOLKSWAGEN NEW BEETLE -- Silver with inexpensive-looking gray leather seats.  Warm and floral, possibly contributed by a wilting daisy in the built-in vase.</p>
        <p>FORD FOCUS -- Blue with gray upholstery.  The first inhale is nothing other than Play-Doh, densely aromatic Play-Doh. A clear sour odor follows.</p>
        <p>MITSUBISHI SSS CONCEPT CAR -- Silver with gray leather interior.  The future smells of dry, aged wood, spices and chemicals.</p>
        <p>QVALE MANGUSTA -- Yellow with black leather interior.  A spicy, musky aroma that leaps out as you open the door.</p>
        <p>ASTON MARTIN DB7 VANTAGE -- Sea green with sea green and cream leather interior.  It smells at once of an indoor tennis club and a warehouse full of rawhide.</p>
        <p>SAAB 9-3 -- Fire-engine red with tan leather seats.  A heady collision of wax, sweet leather and tropical fruit.</p>
