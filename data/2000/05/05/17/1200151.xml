        <p>In 1898, Congress approved an excise tax on a luxury item of the day, the telephone, to help pay for the Spanish-American War. And except for three tax-free hiatuses, it has been on the books since then.</p>
        <p>''That war's been over a long time,'' Representative Jerry Weller said today as the House moved toward repealing the tax, which is 3 percent on phone bills and costs the typical household $50 a year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weller, a Republican from Illinois, is on the Ways and Means subcommittee on oversight that gave gentle questioning to witnesses who were urging repeal. The pro-tax side, if there is one, had no advocates.</p>
        <p>Another member of the subcommittee, Representative Rob Portman, Republican of Ohio, said: ''It finally drives a stake in the heart of the temporary tax that was imposed for the Spanish-American War. It turns out the Spanish were tougher than we thought.''</p>
        <p>The full Ways and Means Committee is expected to approve a bill containing the repeal on Wednesday. It is expected to pass easily in the House, and advocates have high hopes of passage in the Senate.</p>
        <p>Elimination of the excise tax would mean a loss of $5 billion to the government each year.</p>
        <p>The repeal effort is supported by the telephone companies, unions and consumer organizations.</p>
        <p>The excise tax actually has been removed three times, but it has proved a tough bird to kill.</p>
        <p>According to research by Bell Atlantic and the 60 Plus Association, a nonpartisan advocacy group, the tax began in 1898 with a levy of 1 cent for each call costing 15 cents or more.</p>
        <p>The tax was repealed in 1902, only to be reinstituted in 1914 at the rate of 1 cent per call. That tax was repealed in 1916 but reinstated in 1917 at 5 cents a call, this time to help pay America's bills in World War I. It was repealed in 1924 but reinstated in 1932 at 10 to 20 cents a call, depending on the cost of the call.</p>
        <p>It was changed to a flat rate of 20 percent in 1942 (another war), increased to 25 percent in 1943 and reduced to 10 percent in 1954.</p>
        <p>In 1959, Congress voted to have the tax expire in 1960, but then delayed the expiration every year through 1964 and then voted in 1965 to phase it out over the next three years.</p>
        <p>But the phase-out was delayed in 1966 and restructured in 1968 to expire in 1973.</p>
        <p>By 1981, the tax had been reduced to 1 percent. By 1982 it had been increased to 3 percent, with elimination set for 1985.</p>
        <p>The careful reader will have detected a pattern. Instead of expiring in 1985, the 3 percent tax was extended in 1984 to run through 1987; in 1987 it was extended to 1990. And in 1990, any pretenses withdrawn, the tax was made permanent.</p>
        <p>What had been a luxury in 1898, with only 2,000 lines by Bell Atlantic's count, has grown to become a necessity, with a telephone now in 94 percent of American households.</p>
