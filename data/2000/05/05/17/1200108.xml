        <p>Scooping up handfuls of earth, Ahmad Odeh's friends filled his fresh grave today in this village surrounded by olive groves on a hill overlooking Nablus.</p>
        <p>Mr. Odeh, a 20-year-old Palestinian policeman, was killed on Monday near Ramallah during an exchange of gunfire with Israeli soldiers that erupted as violent street protests swept the West Bank.</p>
        <p>Today he was buried here as a national martyr, with full honors. His body was covered with a Palestinian flag and flanked by members of the Palestinian military police, in which he served -- somber men in olive uniforms and bright red berets.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Odeh's body was lowered into the grave, men on rooftops fired rifles into the air, punctuating patriotic eulogies with ringing shots and bursts of automatic fire. The gunmen were members of Al Fatah, the mainstream faction in the Palestine Liberation Organization, which is thought to have organized Monday's protests.</p>
        <p>Although the latest spasm of West Bank violence seemed to be easing today, it has left another layer of bitterness among Israelis and Palestinians. The scars were starkly evident in this community of 3,000, where people grow olives or make their living as laborers in Israel.</p>
        <p>The talk here today was of more sacrifice, not peace.</p>
        <p>''My son was not the first to die or the last to die for Palestine,'' Mr. Odeh's father, Jamal Odeh, said in a eulogy as his son was laid to rest. ''We will give ever more martyrs until the entire land is liberated. Ahmad was my second son and, God willing, the rest of my children will follow him in defense of Palestine.''</p>
        <p>Although Israeli accounts say armed Palestinians began the shooting on Monday, the perception in this village today was that Mr. Odeh and his colleagues had been defending their people against Israeli soldiers who had been firing at stone-throwing protesters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Odeh was shot in the chest during the gun battles as he bent to help a wounded comrade, villagers said.</p>
        <p>''He was defending the right of the Palestinians to a Palestinian state,'' said a military police officer as he stood by the grave.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Odeh's father received a stream of men who arrived at his home to pay their condolences, he seemed dazed by grief. He spoke softly about his son, the second of 13 children, who enlisted in the police after his path to higher education was blocked when he failed his final high school exams.</p>
        <p>The father's eyes flashed when he talked about Monday's violence. ''This happened because the Jews are Jews,'' he said with a look of derision. ''They don't need peace; they only talk about it. They've been wasting time all these years. Killing Arabs, and especially Palestinians, is their aim in life. They won't change.''</p>
        <p>Outside, in a conversation by Mr. Odeh's grave, Muhammad Tawfik, a leader of Al Fatah in the village, said the violence grew out of a sense among Palestinians that Israel was not honoring signed agreements.</p>
        <p>''They are delaying troop withdrawals, failing to release prisoners and building more in the settlements,'' Mr. Tawfik said. ''We feel nothing tangible from this peace.''</p>
        <p>Just last week, Mr. Tawfik said, 23 villagers were hurt in a clash with Israeli soldiers who fired rubber bullets to prevent them from reaching farmland which he said had been sliced off by a road and taken for the neighboring Jewish settlement of Elon Moreh. ''This all leads to discontent,'' Mr. Tawfik said.</p>
        <p>Outside the village, roads strewn with rock barricades and the smoldering remains of burning tires testified to the clashes that raged around Nablus on Monday night, when hundreds of protesters tried to storm Joseph's Tomb, an Israeli-held enclave inside the city. At an Israeli Army base outside Nablus there were several tanks.</p>
        <p>A half-hour's drive south, children at the Jalazun refugee camp near Ramallah stood by the roadside holding rocks, waiting to hurl them at passing Israeli cars. And on the outskirts of Ramallah, clashes between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian youths resumed, but on a smaller scale than Monday's protests.</p>
        <p>Israeli border policemen roared in their jeeps toward waves of stone-throwing teenagers, hurling stun grenades and pushing the protesters back toward Palestinian officers who tried unsuccessfully to break up the crowd.</p>
        <p>Behind the Israeli troops, the City Inn Hotel, a Palestinian-owned establishment that had been a sign of Ramallah's economic revival under Palestinian rule, was empty, commandeered by the soldiers. In the empty lobby, a receptionist waited for no one in particular as soldiers turned people away.</p>
        <p>''Sorry,'' one soldier said. ''Today this is ours.''</p>
