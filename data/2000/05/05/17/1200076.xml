        <p>''Young Dr. Freud'' begins in 1938, with Old Dr. Freud boarding a train from Vienna to London. ''Of all the wise men of his day,'' an unseen narrator intones, ''he was perhaps the least loved, even by himself.'' Axel Corti's film, made for Austrian television in 1976 and opening today at the Film Forum, arrives on these shores at a moment when Freud may be less loved than at any time since his arrival, in 1909, to give a series of lectures. (''They don't know it,'' he is supposed to have remarked to Jung, surveying the crowd waiting to greet him at the dock, ''but I'm bringing them the plague.'')</p>
        <p>As Corti's respectful chronicle of Freud's early obscurity languished in its own twilight, its subject has gone into what may be a permanent eclipse. The clinical methods he pioneered are rapidly being displaced by drug-based therapies, and the empirical validity and theoretical coherence of his ideas have come under attack from all sides.</p>
        <p>All of this makes watching ''Young Dr. Freud'' in the flickering dawn of the 21st century a somewhat uncanny experience. Shot in dreamy black and white and paced with the stagy sobriety of an educational film, the movie feels at once dated and curiously urgent, nearly impossible to place in historical perspective.</p>
        <p>Corti, who died in 1993, asks us to imagine a pre-Freudian Freud and to recall a world both innocent of psychoanalysis and desperately in need of it. Coming belatedly to light in an increasingly post-Freudian culture, his film serves as a salutary reminder both of Freud's centrality to the history of the 20th century and of his origins in the 19th. He seems like a character out of Ibsen: a restless, modern spirit full of contradictions, menaced by doubts and deformed by his own arrogance.</p>
        <p>This Freud is poor, lonely and ambitious. In the period covered by the film, he strives to establish himself professionally and matrimonially in the rigid, stuffy, anti-Semitic world of late-Hapsburg Vienna. His studies, his relationships with other doctors and scientists, and his long courtship of Martha Bernays are occasionally interrupted by a disembodied voice from the future who queries young Sigmund with the calm aggression of an analyst about his ambivalent Jewishness, his childhood and the implications of his work.</p>
        <p>In allowing Freud to step out of time, to look back on his early life in the midst of living it, the film emphasizes both his superhuman perspicacity and his almost inhuman detachment from his own life. Corti honors Freud's belief that the human predicament, his own included, could be understood and perhaps cured through objective, dispassionate analysis. But Corti's own analysis uncovers the coldness and insecurity beneath Freud's consuming intellectual passion.</p>
        <p>At times Corti's analysis feels interminable. The claustrophobic Viennese interiors and the long disquisitions on medical and scientific questions sometimes make you think you're listening to a lecture rather than watching a movie. All the same it is thrilling to witness the lurching, uncertain process of scientific discovery. Freud, obsessed with the need to make a contribution to knowledge, moves from studying the sex life of eels to helping the more established doctor Josef Breuer treat a young hysteric named Bertha Pappenheim, whom the two would later immortalize as Anna O. in their book ''Studies in Hysteria.''</p>
        <p>As the film chronicles Freud's apprenticeship with Breuer, his encounter with the French clinician Jean-Martin Charcot at the Salpetriere clinic in Paris, and the start of his long, strange friendship with the dubious Berlin nose specialist Wilhelm Fliess, you can see the intuitive outlines of his later theories taking shape.</p>
        <p>''These ideas were in the air,'' he demurs when his interviewer asks if psychoanalysis would have existed without him, and that seems almost literally to be true, as though the unconscious, the sex drive and the Oedipus complex were ghosts haunting bourgeois Vienna, waiting to be brought to life, and exorcised.</p>
        <p>''Young Dr. Freud'' is not a standard great man biography, though it sometimes looks like one. Doctrinaire Freudians may find it insufficiently reverential. Those who, like Freud's imperious laboratory supervisor, believe that the human mind is best understood with reference to chemical and physical processes, will be impatient with Corti's deference before Freud's now unfashionable dualism.</p>
        <p>Others may be troubled that the film glosses over some disturbing facts about Freud's early clinical experiments, especially those done in collaboration with Fleiss. And viewers without some grounding in the history of psychoanalysis may feel a bit lost. But somehow, in spite of its limitations, this film places Freud exactly where he belongs: in a shadowy, irrecoverable past and right here in our midst, the cause, cure and embodiment of so much that continues to plague us.</p>
