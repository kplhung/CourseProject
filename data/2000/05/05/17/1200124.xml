        <p>Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, still believes that his medicine -- higher interest rates -- will reduce the economy's feverish growth.

        <p>Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, still believes that his medicine -- higher interest rates -- will reduce the economy's feverish growth. But it appears that the medicine is much weaker than he thought just a year ago, and that much higher doses will be needed to have the desired effect.</p>
        <p>Last June, when the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee raised interest rates for the first of what has now become six times, the committee's minutes reflected a general expectation of ''appreciable moderation in the trend'' of economic growth in the months ahead.</p>
        <p>At that time, a divided Fed decided not to signal that there would be future interest rate increases. This was despite warnings by some members that the lack of such a signal could be interpreted as meaning that no further raises in rates were likely. In fact, that exact interpretation took hold as financial markets rallied on the news.</p>
        <p>Since June, the economy has behaved in a way that few if any would have expected. The boom has continued, and economic growth has accelerated. Housing starts, industrial production and inflation are up, while unemployment is down.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, when the Fed announced its sixth rate increase -- and the first in that series to bolster the federal funds rate target by half a percentage point, not the usual quarter-point rise -- it went out of its way to warn that it was still worried about inflation, and to hint that more increases would come unless and until the economy began to cool.</p>
        <p>''Increases in demand have remained in excess of even the rapid pace of productivity-driven gains in potential supply, exerting continued pressure on resources,'' the Fed said in its report yesterday. ''The committee is concerned that this disparity in the growth of demand and potential supply will continue, which could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's outstanding performance.''</p>
        <p>Translated, said Robert Barbara, the chief economist at Hoenig &amp; Company, ''the Fed said we will be more aggressive in our attempts'' to slow the economy.</p>
        <p>The Wall Street reaction this time was a bit confused and hesitant at first. Stock prices had been up sharply for the day, amid hopes that the expected half-point increase might be accompanied by language hinting that the Fed's series of rate increases was nearing an end. Most of the gains evaporated in the 30 minutes after the Fed's announcement, a reaction that did not seem surprising given the relatively strong language.</p>
        <p>But the immediate alarm soon faded, and it appears that many small orders came in for stocks, which rebounded to end the day near the highs set before the Fed acted.</p>
        <p>If the market's action indicates that many investors believe the good times will continue, that is understandable. The Fed's efforts to slow the economy have proved unsuccessful, and even if they do succeed there is a general expectation that Mr. Greenspan will ride to the rescue to prevent any kind of economic calamity. That is what he has done in the past, and the confidence that he will do so again makes it harder for the Fed to put a drag on the torrid pace of economic activity.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most surprising economic statistic now relates to housing, an industry that historically has been among the most sensitive to changes in interest rates. The data available to the Fed last June showed housing starts were running at a strong annual rate of 1.65 million over the previous three months. Six rate increases later, the figure is 1.7 million.</p>
        <p>The stock market still thinks housing will weaken. The Standard &amp; Poor's index of home builders is down 24 percent since last June, even though profits for most of the companies the index comprises have continued to rise. Many other stocks that are viewed as being sensitive to economic cycles have suffered during the period, reflecting the expectation, at least, that the economy will slow.</p>
        <p>But the performance of those stocks was offset by the surge in many technology stocks, as enthusiasm for the new economy heated up. That enthusiasm peaked in early March, and although the technology-laden Nasdaq composite index is down 26 percent since then, it is still up 41 percent since June 29, 1999, the day before the first rate increase.</p>
        <p>One reason that the Fed's efforts to slow the economy have not worked very rapidly is that market interest rates have not cooperated. The Fed directly controls the federal funds rate, which is the rate banks charge on loans to one another. That rate has climbed 1.75 percentage points, to 6.5 percent, since the Fed began tightening.</p>
        <p>But the rate on three-month Treasury bills is up only 1.33 percentage points, to 6.02 percent, during the same period. And the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds has risen by just under half a percentage point, to 6.42 percent. Rates on corporate bonds, which may have a greater impact on economic activity, have risen more than the rates on Treasury securities but still not by as much as the federal funds rate.</p>
        <p>There are always lags in the economic response to the Fed's moves, but the failure of the Fed to have any apparent impact so far remains surprising. One explanation for the economy's persistent strength is the wealth effect -- the feeling of many investors that they are richer after years of big rises in stock prices. Another is that the United States continues to draw in heavy foreign investment, which is reacting both to the healthy stock market and the buoyant economy.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, it is likely that sometime this year the Fed's medicine will begin to take effect. When it does, that will slow the growth in corporate profits and rein in corporate plans to invest in new productive capacity. The dollar may also come under pressure as investments here look less attractive.</p>
        <p>But for now, the economy is booming, and investors seem to have no fears that the Fed will do serious damage to an economic expansion that is already the longest in American history.</p>
