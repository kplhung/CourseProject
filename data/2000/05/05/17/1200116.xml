        <p>THERE is usually a lull along Madison Avenue as the American Association of Advertising Agencies holds its annual management conference. Now that the conference has ended, there has been a spate of developments involving the accounts of major national marketers like J. C. Penney, H &amp; R Block and Lucent Technologies.</p>
        <p>Temerlin McClain in Irving, Tex., which lost most of the J. C. Penney account in January, is resigning its remaining assignment, effective in 90 days, creating campaigns for St. John's Bay, a private-label apparel line. Billings were estimated at $10 million.</p>

        <p>THERE is usually a lull along Madison Avenue as the American Association of Advertising Agencies holds its annual management conference. Now that the conference has ended, there has been a spate of developments involving the accounts of major national marketers like J. C. Penney, H &amp; R Block and Lucent Technologies.</p>
        <p>Temerlin McClain in Irving, Tex., which lost most of the J. C. Penney account in January, is resigning its remaining assignment, effective in 90 days, creating campaigns for St. John's Bay, a private-label apparel line. Billings were estimated at $10 million.</p>
        <p>The resignation, which was not expected, came in a letter sent yesterday to Penney by the agency, part of True North Communications. Liener Temerlin, chairman at Temerlin McClain, attributed the resignation to ''philosophical differences.''</p>
        <p>''We think it's in the best interest of not only ourselves but of J. C. Penney'' to resign the assignment, Mr. Temerlin said, adding that the decision was unrelated to the agency's dismissal on the bulk of the creative chores on the account, with billings estimated at $100 million to $200 million. Those tasks were shifted last month to offices of DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group.</p>
        <p>''We hold DDB in the highest regard,'' Mr. Temerlin said, ''and we think they can do an outstanding job'' for Penney. The retail company is plagued with problems in merchandise assortment and presentation that have produced a persistent slump in sales as shoppers shift to stores like Kohl's and Target.</p>
        <p>Stephanie Brown, a spokeswoman for Penney, based in Plano, Tex., said marketing executives could not be reached for comment.</p>
        <p>H &amp; R Block, the financial services company, narrowed a review for its advertising and marketing account, which began in early April, to three agencies from six. Billings were estimated at $100 million.</p>
        <p>Neil Getzlow, a spokesman for H &amp; R Block in Kansas City, Mo., identified the finalists as the Chicago office of DDB and two agencies that are part of the Interpublic Group of Companies: Campbell Mithun Esty in Minneapolis and Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston.</p>
        <p>Mr. Getzlow listed the three agencies eliminated from the review as Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners Worldwide in New York, part of the Lowe Group unit of Interpublic; Publicis in New York, part of Publicis S.A.; and the Richards Group in Dallas. A decision is expected before the end of June.</p>
        <p>The H &amp; R Block account had been handled mostly by several units of Young &amp; Rubicam Inc. in New York, which decided against taking part in the review soon after it began. The units included the Chicago office of Y.&amp; R. Advertising, which worked on the account since 1996; the Bravo Group, for ads aimed at Spanish-speaking consumers; Media Edge, for media services; and Impiric, for direct marketing. The review came almost a year after a new chief marketing officer joined H &amp; R Block.</p>
        <p>Lucent Technologies, based in Murray Hill, N.J., named the San Francisco office of FCB Worldwide to serve as the lead agency for the Enterprise Networks Group, a communications and networking technology company that Lucent plans to spin off later this year. Billings were estimated at $50 million.</p>
        <p>The decision came after a review that had been narrowed to FCB San Francisco, part of True North, and one other finalist, the Leo Burnett USA unit of the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago, part of the B Com3  Group. Another contender, Deutsch Inc. in New York, withdrew last week. The FCB San Francisco office will be supported by the agency's New York office; international offices of FCB will manage advertising  market by market.</p>
        <p>And a member of the Syndicate -- a creative consortium of eight small agencies and Ogilvy &amp; Mather North America in New York, part of the Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide unit of the WPP Group -- landed the account of Weave Innovations in Santa Clara, Calif., which builds Internet products and services. Billings were estimated at more than $5 million.</p>
        <p>Hunt Adkins in Minneapolis, one of the Syndicate's eight shops, was named as the first agency for Weave. Ogilvy will provide Weave with account planning and Mindshare, the media services sibling of Ogilvy, will provide media planning and buying.</p>
