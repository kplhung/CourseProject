        <p>Vicente Fox Quesada, the opposition candidate who appears to have taken a narrow lead in the presidential race, received a helping hand today from two prominent Mexicans with family roots deep in the governing party.</p>
        <p>One figure, Federico Reyes Heroles, a leading intellectual whose father was national president of the Institutional Revolutionary Party, the governing party, said in an essay published today that Mr. Fox would probably be elected president and warned the party, known as the PRI, not to try to prevent a Fox victory through fraud. Its greatest contribution now to the Mexico it has governed for 71 years could be to relinquish power peacefully, he said.</p>
        <p>The second figure, Layda Sansores San Roman, a senator whose father was also a national president of the governing party, endorsed Mr. Fox's candidacy. She will campaign for Mr. Fox in Campeche on the Gulf Coast, where her father's legacy as party leader and state governor has given her a few thousand followers.</p>
        <p>''I'm joining with Fox because he's become the standard-bearer for the democratic movement,'' Ms. Sansores said with Mr. Fox smiling at her side at his headquarters here. ''The country must complete its democratic transition, and the PRI is now the bottleneck.''</p>
        <p>The endorsement from Ms. Sansores, who was a PRI member until she switched to a leftist party in 1996, was extended in a ceremony in which seven other federal and state congress members and lesser politicians from two leftist parties also joined Mr. Fox's campaign. They were the latest of 12 similar statements by other politicians, from the governing party, as well as opposition parties, who have joined Mr. Fox's campaign in recent weeks. It remains unclear how much influence the endorsements will have on millions of voters who remain undecided six weeks before voting on July 2.</p>
        <p>Javier Trevino, a spokesman for the governing party's presidential nominee, Francisco Labastida Ochoa, dismissed their importance and disputed Mr. Reyes Heroles's portrayal of a governing party campaign in decline. Polls financed by the party show Mr. Labastida leading Mr. Fox, Mr. Trevino said.</p>
        <p>''And do not disregard the PRI's powerful nationwide organization,'' Mr. Trevino added. ''You win an election through communications and through organization, and no party besides the PRI has such strong organization.''</p>
        <p>In interviews, political scientists warned against underestimating the party's chances, given the resiliency of a party that has governed longer than any other in the world. Still, the events today lend Mr. Fox's candidacy an image of momentum.</p>
        <p>''Fox continues to rise, and Labastida to decline,'' Mr. Reyes Heroles said in his essay, published in the newspaper Reforma. ''If the trends continue, in the absence of earthquakes, Vicente Fox Quesada will be the next president of Mexico. We must, finally, liberate our minds.''</p>
        <p>Those statements were significant not because they were unique -- many experts have commented on Mr. Fox's rising fortunes -- but because of his family ties to the governing party. He is not a party member. But his father, Jesus Reyes Heroles, forged broad changes to the political system in his three-year presidency and subsequent tenure as interior secretary in the 1970's. Federico Reyes Heroles's older brother, Jesus, is Mexico's ambassador to the United States.</p>
        <p>''I'm not saying the PRI is dead,'' Mr. Reyes Heroles said. ''But a victory by Labastida appears more remote every day.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 20, 2000, Saturday  A subheading on Wednesday about new support for Vicente Fox Quesada, the leading opposition candidate in Mexico's presidential election, referred incorrectly to Federico Reyes Heroles, a political commentator whose views were cited. He is an independent political analyst who wrote that Mr. Fox would probably be elected president. He is not a politician, is not a member of PRI, the governing party, and has not endorsed Mr. Fox.</p>
