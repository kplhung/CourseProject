        <p>Two White Plains girls, ages 12 and 14, were raped, sodomized and held overnight in a Bronx apartment over the weekend by four men they met through a telephone chat line, the police said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The men, 24 and 26, were arrested on Monday, said Sgt. Elias Nikas, a police spokesman.</p>
        <p>After one of the men, Christino Martinez, 26, struck up a friendship with the girls on the phone line, he arranged to meet them Saturday evening in White Plains, Sergeant Nikas said. Mr. Martinez and the other three men picked up the girls  and drove them to the apartment where Mr. Martinez and two of the other men live, at 107 East 175th Street in the Tremont section of the Bronx, the sergeant said.</p>
        <p>Investigators said the four men -- Mr. Martinez, Luis Procel, 24, Lawrence Cabezas, 26, and Miguel Cardona, 26 -- got the girls drunk and spent much of the night sexually assaulting them. At 6 a.m. Sunday, the men drove the girls back to White Plains and dropped them off, the authorities said.</p>
        <p>The girls reported the events to  their parents, who took them to Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla. Doctors found evidence that the girls had been raped and notified the police, an investigator said.</p>
        <p>About 8:45 a.m. Monday, police officers from the Bronx Special Victims Unit went to the apartment where the girls had been held and arrested Mr. Procel, Mr. Martinez and Mr. Cabezas, all of whom live there, Sergeant Nikas said. Mr. Cardona, who lives a few miles away at 1717 Vyse Avenue in Crotona Park East, was arrested a short time later, the police said.</p>
        <p>All four men were charged with sexual abuse and endangering the welfare of a child. In addition, Mr. Procel was charged with rape, and Mr. Martinez with rape and sodomy.</p>
