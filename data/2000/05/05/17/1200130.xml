        <p>The Hewlett-Packard Company reported  fiscal second-quarter earnings today that exceeded Wall Street estimates. The company cited strong sales of personal computers and Unix servers used on corporate networks and the Internet.</p>
        <p>Results for Agilent Technologies, the test-  and measurement-equipment maker spun off by Hewlett-Packard last year, met expectations. Hewlett-Packard said it would complete the distribution of Agilent to shareholders on June 2.</p>
        <p>For the quarter ended April 30, Hewlett-Packard reported earnings from continuing operations of $816 million, or 79 cents a diluted share, up 6.5 percent from $766 million, or 73 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue from continuing operations grew 15 percent, to $12 billion, compared with $10.5 billion in the year-earlier period.</p>
        <p>Excluding expenses related to the company's early retirement program, the spinoff of Agilent, the incremental effect of stock appreciation rights and certain equity gains during the quarter, the company had earnings of 87 cents a share. Analysts had expected Hewlett-Packard to earn 82 cents a share, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.</p>
        <p>Hewlett-Packard reported its results after the close of the market, but a number of analysts had issued positive reports anticipating a stronger-than-expected quarter. Its shares closed at $140, up $10.625, on the New York Stock Exchange, where Agilent shares closed at $96, up $7.8125.</p>
        <p>Carleton S. Fiorina, Hewlett-Packard's president and chief executive, said in a statement: ''We are delivering the growth we promised.''</p>
        <p>Hewlett-Packard's fastest growing business was in personal computers, where the company benefited in part from the withdrawal of I.B.M. and Packard Bell from the consumer market. Notebook revenue grew 180 percent, while unit growth was 248 percent for the quarter compared with the period a year earlier. Home PC revenue rose 85 percent year over year, with unit growth of more than 100 percent.</p>
        <p>Although Hewlett-Packard continues to trail Sun Microsystems in Unix servers, the company made strong gains in the quarter. Unix server revenue and order growth were up 26 percent and 32 percent, respectively. Over all, the computer systems business, which includes PC's, servers, storage and software, grew 19 percent in revenue.</p>
        <p>Revenue from printers and imaging devices grew just 9 percent, which Hewlett-Packard said reflected a new program to reduce inventories in the dealer and distributor channel. Without this program, revenues would have grown by 13 percent, the company said.</p>
        <p>''The PC numbers look pretty good, but the bad news is you don't want the revenue growth rate to be dependent on the commodity product,'' said Daniel Kunstler, an analyst with J. P. Morgan. ''Unix got a big percentage rise, simply because it's off a pretty low base last year.''</p>
        <p>Separately, Agilent reported earnings of $166 million, or 36 cents a diluted share, up 6 percent from $157 million, or 41 cents a share in the  period a year earlier. Per share figures reflect an increase in the number of shares outstanding to 457 million from 380 million in the year-earlier period. Sales rose 24 percent, to $2.49 billion from $2.01 billion in the second quarter of fiscal 1999.</p>
        <p>Agilent's second-quarter earnings included nearly 4 cents related to one-time gains from sales of investments. Excluding these gains, Agilent earned 32 cents a share, equal to the First Call consensus estimate.</p>
        <p>Agilent said its businesses that addressed communications and electronics were particularly strong and represented about 75 percent of second-quarter revenue. Orders in test and measurement increased to $1.8 billion, up 70 percent over year-earlier period. Net revenue for this business rose 44 percent, to $1.4 billion.</p>
        <p>Agilent said orders for semiconductor products for the quarter rose to $626 million, an increase of 25 percent compared with the second quarter of fiscal 1999. Net revenue increased 22 percent over the same period a year earlier and totaled $497 million.</p>
