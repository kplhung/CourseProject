        <p>Hilary Appelman on the macho makeover of minivans being undertaken to appeal buyers, female as well as male, who need vans but wish they did not; vans have sleeker styling and are equipped with range of accessories that make them less 'mommy-mobile dull' and more like sport utility vehicles (Special Section, Cars); photos (M)</p>

        <p>SUBURBAN cowboys, look out. The revved-up interloper in the next parking space may be a minivan.</p>
        <p>Enough of your gas-guzzling, lane-hogging sport utility vehicles. The minivan, automakers would like you to think, can be useful and cool.

        <p>SUBURBAN cowboys, look out. The revved-up interloper in the next parking space may be a minivan.</p>
        <p>Enough of your gas-guzzling, lane-hogging sport utility vehicles. The minivan, automakers would like you to think, can be useful and cool. New models are equipped with back-seat televisions and Global Positioning Systems. Their engines are as big, or bigger, than those of many S.U.V.'s. The styling is hardly mommy-mobile dull.</p>
        <p>Minivan sales, which had been flat since 1994, were up last year by 10 percent, to 1.34 million, keeping pace with the overall booming auto market but trailing S.U.V. sales. In the first three months of this year, minivan sales were up 15 percent over the same period last year. The leap in sales was fueled by the cut-rate financing (as low as .9 percent over 60 months) being offered by DaimlerChrysler, which is the market leader and is clearing space for its 2001 models, and the competition.</p>
        <p>The macho trend in minivans started at Pontiac, where the Montana, with its sport-utility-style molding and cowboy marketing, was designed for what the company calls ''reluctant intenders,'' people who need a minivan but wish they did not.</p>
        <p>''It represented a change in their life that they didn't really enjoy,'' said Jim Murray, the brand manager for the Montana. ''It said, 'I'm no longer young and hip; now I'm a soccer mom, and I've got to buy this mommy-mobile.' '' The reluctant intenders  liked the look and prestige of sport utility vehicles, Mr. Murray said, ''but they really needed the functionality that only minivans could provide.''</p>
        <p>Other automakers have followed. While professing not to be competitive with sport utilities -- DaimlerChrysler says that only about 5 percent of minivan buyers consider both -- minivan makers are falling over themselves to offer features like specially tuned shock absorbers and springs, traction control and all-wheel drive.</p>
        <p>Honda's hugely successful Odyssey van, which is available with an optional touch-screen Global Positioning System, was  meant to appeal to men, said Art Garner, Honda's public-relations manager.</p>
        <p>''It's the most aggressive of any minivan,'' Mr. Garner said. ''The design theme was a knight's armor, very rugged, very sharp and angular.''</p>
        <p>The Odyssey's 210-horsepower engine is the largest in a minivan, but not for long. DaimlerChrysler is upping the ante with its 2001 models, which will have up to a 230-horsepower engine as well as power-controlled rear door and center consoles with power outlets and cell-phone battery chargers.</p>
        <p>DaimlerChrysler is testing a concept minivan with skylights and fully reclining seats, inspired by executive jet interiors and intended for the growing luxury-van market. The automaker is also testing a Dodge Caravan with race-car styling.</p>
        <p>General Motors' European subsidiary, Opel, is showing a concept all-wheel-drive minivan called the Snow Trekker this year. The car has a glass roof, heated cup holders and interior storage for ski poles.</p>
        <p>Not everyone is sure the minivan can  morph into a machomobile.</p>
        <p>''They're trying to attract more guys into minivans with these performance minivans?'' asked George Pipas, a sales analyst at Ford Motor Company. ''Give me a break. The high-performance minivan is an oxymoron.'' Minivan drivers, he added, are not ''revving their engines at stoplights, and they'd look pretty foolish if they did.''</p>
        <p>Yet even the Ford Windstar, which is trumped for its top safety ratings and ''mom-designed'' conveniences like mirrors with a view of the back seat and dimmers for sleeping babies, is offered in a sport version, with a leather-upholstered steering wheel, aluminum wheels and a two-tone exterior.</p>
        <p>Consumers from baby boomers down are increasingly buying cars based on their image, said Christopher Cedergren, a consultant at Nextrend, a marketing company in Thousand Oaks, Calif. ''A lot of people will tell you they drive S.U.V.'s for function, but really it's because they're cool,'' he said. ''In effect, cars are clothes.''</p>
        <p>But minivans are different, Mr. Cedergren contended. ''Vans are driven by the part of the population looking for function,'' he said. ''They are purchased for their intended purpose: to haul people and things.''</p>
        <p>EFFORTS to make major changes are limited by the popularity of minivans; in fact, 1 of every 12 cars sold is a minivan. Indeed, many buyers, like Phyllis Rifkin-Russell of Brighton, N.Y., which is near Rochester, are happy with what they have. She owns a 1996 Plymouth Voyager.</p>
        <p>''We have no issues around image, none,''  Mrs. Rifkin-Russell said as she watched her 16-year-old son play soccer in the rain. ''It absolutely is the quintessential suburban car, which makes us laugh, but that's our life. It just really is a great family car.''</p>
        <p>Cecilia Iacoviello, who lives in Rochester, N.Y., switched back to a minivan -- a 1999 Plymouth Voyager -- after owning a Nissan Pathfinder, which her teenage son and daughter had talked her into buying.</p>
        <p>''Everyone says, 'Oh you're such an old lady,' '' Ms. Iacoviello said. ''I say, 'You're jealous because I'm spending less money than you on gas.' ''</p>
        <p>Even as automakers add ''muscular'' styling and pump up the minivan's performance, they are also rolling out features aimed at easing the seemingly stressed-out lives of minivan customers, families with preschool and school-age children. (The fast-growing retiree and empty-nester segment of the market is also integral to the minivan's popularity.)</p>
        <p>In a survey conducted by the Ford Motor Company, minivan owners were asked to clip magazine pictures that expressed their  lives. The images they picked were comfortable shoes, a woman having her hair done, a man up at night with a crying baby and Tom Hanks pointing a gun to his head.</p>
        <p>One woman picked an octopus, saying, ''I feel like I've got to be all things to all people, doing a million things at once.''</p>
        <p>Paul Malboeuf, an advance-product research manager at Ford, said, ''That led to the conclusion that if a lot of people who are driving these vehicles are leading stressful lives, then wouldn't it be a good thing to pay attention to that in terms of the design of the vehicle?''</p>
        <p>The Windstar is available with a VCR, video-game jacks and a fold-down liquid-crystal-display television screen to keep rear-seat passengers busy. Other carmakers offer similar systems. Front- and back-seat passengers in the Windstar can hear different music simultaneously. For example, classical for grown-ups in the front seats and, through wireless headphones,  heavy metal for the teenager in the back.</p>
        <p>NEW models offer remote-operated sliding doors, multiple-CD changers in the dashboard, a wide variety in cup holders and conveniences like Honda's  individual heat and air vents and reading lights.</p>
        <p>''They're adopting the mobile-home strategy: 'What kind of extra stuff can we load in there?' '' said Jack Trout, the president of Trout and Partners, a marketing company in Greenwich, Conn. ''More doors, doors that slide, doors that open -- 'O.K., we'll put in a TV.' I think we've kind of hit the edge on gadgets.''</p>
        <p>But Dave Bostwick, the director of corporate market research at DaimlerChrysler,  predicted there would be more entertainment options. ''People can't get enough of things to occupy their time,'' he said. ''The adventure for the minivan owner is to be able to stuff a whole household of stuff and go somewhere.''</p>
