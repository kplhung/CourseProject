      <abstract>
        <p>Letter from Mary Ewing Mulligan, (International Wine Center) comments on Frank Prial's May 3 article on wine education</p>
      </abstract>

    <body.content>
      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I couldn't agree more with Frank Prial regarding his statement that the wine industry has made wine complicated for consumers (''To Enjoy a Glass, Lessons Are Not Needed,'' May 3). Wine is also complicated in its own right, because of the foreign names, the obscure grapes and numerous other factors beyond the industry's doing.</p>
        <p>The complicated nature of wine should not discredit wine education but validate it. Wine courses and guided tastings can help people become more comfortable with wine and teach them to see beyond the industry hype. To suggest that wine is just a fun beverage for enjoying with a meal, and not (in some cases) an art form worth studying, is as narrow-minded as saying that food is just food and that gourmet cooking classes for consumers are inappropriate.</p>

        <p>Mr. Prial should give wine drinkers more credit. They love wine, and many of them have a strong desire to understand its complexities. To enthusiastic consumers, learning about wine can be fun.</p>
        <p>He should also give more credit to wine educators. Rather than wallowing in profits from a ''lucrative'' business, most of them are passionate individuals whose professional compensation is primarily the enthusiasm of their students.</p>
