        <p>THE ISSUES</p>
        <p>BATTLE OVER BATTLE FLAG -- If South Carolina lawmakers hoped that the N.A.A.C.P. would drop its economic boycott of the state now that they have agreed to move the Confederate battle flag from the Statehouse dome, they had not counted on the group's tenacity. Kweisi Mfume, the national president of the group, said yesterday that the N.A.A.C.P. might even consider expanding the boycott beyond tourism, because the state plans to move the banner to a flagpole in front of the State Capitol, near a monument to Confederate soldiers. Although the group's original boycott resolution demanded that the flag be moved out of a position of sovereignty, Mr. Mfume argued that the flag was no less prominent in front of the building than it was on top. The State Senate and House are expected to iron out minor differences on a bill to move the flag in the next few weeks, and it is scheduled to be lowered on July 1.</p>

        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>DECISION IN KENNEDY CASE -- The Los Angeles city attorney declined yesterday to file misdemeanor battery charges against Representative Patrick J. Kennedy of Rhode Island over a confrontation with a security guard at Los Angeles International Airport in March. The prosecutor's office summoned Mr. Kennedy, 32, and the guard, Della Patton, 58, to a hearing last week to review a videotape of the incident. Mr. Kennedy had earlier acknowledged acting rudely and apologized, but he denied hurting Ms. Patton. ''I am obviously happy that city officials agree that I did not do what I was accused of,'' Mr. Kennedy said in a statement. George L. Mallory Jr., a lawyer for Ms. Patton, who has complained of shoulder pain and has not worked since the incident, said he expected to approach Mr. Kennedy about a settlement and would sue if those talks failed.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>GUBERNATORIAL EARLY BIRD -- It's a year early, but the 2001 governor's race in Virginia is already taking shape, with one self-made millionaire announcing this week that he is stepping aside for another in the Democratic competition. Former congressman L. F. Payne Jr., a Charlottesville developer who lost as the Democratic Party's candidate for lieutenant governor in 1997, took himself out of the running and endorsed Mark R. Warner, who heads a venture capital firm in Alexandria. Mr. Payne said Mr. Warner had ''the right experience, the right ideas and the right values'' to win the governorship. Mr. Payne's base is among rural conservative Democrats and he showed his popularity by finishing ahead of the rest of his ticket in the Democrats' bid to take the Statehouse in 1997. But he conceded that Mr. Warner, whose base is in the northern suburbs, already had a dominant edge in organization and fund-raising among high-tech corporate donors. As he stepped aside, Mr. Payne was accompanied by supporters insisting that he would still be a good candidate for governor in 2005. In the meantime, he may take on a role in Mr. Warner's campaign. The Republican nomination for governor next year is expected to be contested by Lt. Gov. John H. Hager, who defeated Mr. Payne in 1997, and Attorney General Mark L. Earley.</p>

        <p>'LIVE TAX FREE OR DIE' -- Gov. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire announced yesterday that she would seek a third two-year term. But she did not say whether she would renew her pledge to veto an income tax, which is seen by some state leaders, albeit reluctantly, as the best way for the state to respond to a court order to reform its school financing system. Year in and year out, taxes are the hottest political issue in New Hampshire, a state that, along with Alaska, has no personal income tax or general sales tax (its official motto is ''Live Free Or Die'') and whose residents take great pride in roughing up politicians who do not pledge to oppose new levies. Governor Shaheen, a Democrat, took ''the pledge'' in her 1996 and 1998 campaigns but she has thus far avoided discussing what she might do in the 2000 campaign -- though she did agree to a temporary tax, at one point, as the state initially tried to respond to the court school-financing order. In this year's Democratic primary, she will face State Senator Mark Fernald, who supports a state income tax to solve the school problem. On the Republican side, four candidates are competing for the nomination, with mixed views on the tax question. There is also an independent candidate.</p>

        <p>THE 2000 CAMPAIGN  Correction:  May 22, 2000, Monday  A picture caption on Wednesday about the graduation of Vice President's Al Gore's daughter Karenna Gore Schiff from Columbia Law School referred imprecisely to her degree. She is not the newest lawyer in her immediate family; she is the only one. While Mr. Gore's parents were both lawyers and he attended law school, he did not graduate.</p>
