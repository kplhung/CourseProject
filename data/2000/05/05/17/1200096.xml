        <p>Re ''Knight Gets 'Last Chance' to Coach at Indiana'' (Sports pages, May 16) and ''At Indiana, the Toadies Are Shocked,'' by Harvey Araton (Sports of The Times, May 16):</p>
        <p>Mr. Araton is right when he notes that Indiana University has been ''held hostage by a basketball coach'' for 29 years. But the Bob Knight debacle seems to be an example of the phenomenon whereby hostages sometimes begin to feel sympathetic toward their captors.</p>
        <p>Any reasonably principled university president and board of trustees would have fired Knight long ago. The school's investigators shot an air ball when they said Knight had displayed a ''pattern of inappropriate behavior.'' His behavior -- which includes grabbing a player by the neck -- has been reprehensible and easily worthy of firing.</p>
        <p>Myles Brand, the university's president, also stated that Knight's ''abusive and embarrassing behavior will not be tolerated.'' In fact, his abusive, bullying and threatening behavior has sadly been tolerated for decades.</p>
