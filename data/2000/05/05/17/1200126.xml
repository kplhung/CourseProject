      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial hails Stillwater Mining Co accord with local environmental and citizens' groups that holds its two Montana platinum mines to higher environmental standards than those required by state and federal authorities</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In the past, the mining industry in Montana has made few environmental concessions to anyone. But in a surprising and salutary development, the Stillwater Mining Company, which operates two platinum mines in the Beartooth Mountains at the edge of the Absaroka-Beartooth Wilderness, has signed a good-neighbor agreement with a coalition of local environmental and citizens' groups operating under the umbrella of the Northern Plains Resource Council.</p>
        <p>This striking agreement holds the East Boulder and Stillwater mines to a higher set of environmental standards than those required by state and federal authorities. It institutes oversight committees with members drawn from mine management and citizens' groups. The company will place thousands of acres under conservation easements, and it will finance audits of its own environmental performance. Most important, it has agreed to an open exchange of information with the council and will invest in what the council calls ''groundbreaking new water treatment and waste reduction technologies.''</p>

        <p>This striking agreement holds the East Boulder and Stillwater mines to a higher set of environmental standards than those required by state and federal authorities. It institutes oversight committees with members drawn from mine management and citizens' groups. The company will place thousands of acres under conservation easements, and it will finance audits of its own environmental performance. Most important, it has agreed to an open exchange of information with the council and will invest in what the council calls ''groundbreaking new water treatment and waste reduction technologies.''</p>
        <p>It is possible to attribute the fact of this agreement to the profitability of these mines, which has given Stillwater Mining greater latitude to negotiate. But this agreement could not have come about without enlightened leadership at the company or the dedication of negotiators for local citizens and environmentalists. The result makes genuine environmental protection consistent with continued productivity. With luck, this may become a model for similar agreements elsewhere.</p>
