        <p>When E. F. Hutton talks, Al Gore doesn't listen.</p>
        <p>The vice president does not invest in the stock market. He told reporters yesterday that he had shied away from the market for nearly 25 years because he was worried that as a public official, any investments might look like a conflict of interest.</p>
        <p>''Twenty-four years ago, when I ran for Congress, for good or ill, I made the decision that in order to avoid even the appearance of any conflict of interest, on the many subjects that would come up for votes, I decided as a matter of personal policy I would not invest in stocks,'' Mr. Gore told reporters yesterday at a news conference in New York.</p>
        <p>''Now, missing the bull market is not the greatest thing in the world, financially,'' he said a little sheepishly. ''But for me, it was the right decision.''</p>
        <p>The issue came up after Gov. George W. Bush asserted that Mr. Gore had a ''substantial amount of his money invested in the stock market.'' Mr. Bush made the statement Monday in promoting his plan to allow people to invest some of their Social Security payroll taxes in the market. Mr. Bush may have thought it was a safe assumption, given that half of all American households are invested in the market.</p>
        <p>Financial experts suggested they would have made the same assumption. David G. Dietze, president of Point View Financial Services, an investment advisory firm in Summit, N.J., said it was highly unusual for someone of Mr. Gore's age (52) and income ($171,500 a year) not to be invested. ''There's probably only one chance in 100 that someone of his ilk would not have investments in the stock market,'' Mr. Dietze said.</p>
        <p>A 1998 examination of Mr. Gore's finances by Fortune Magazine concluded that Mr. Gore's assets were dwindling and questioned how he could hope to run the United States economy as president with such a dismal track record with his own finances. Fortune said Mr. Gore had a small amount of money in I.R.A.'s, but that most of his money was in checking and passbook accounts or tied up in property.</p>
        <p>''This potential president could be a financial dolt,'' Fortune wrote, noting that in addition to his salary, the vice president had earned more than $1 million from his book ''Earth in the Balance.''</p>
        <p>''This is a family in dire need of a money manager,'' the magazine wrote.</p>
