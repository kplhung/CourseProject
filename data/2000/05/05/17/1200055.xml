        <p>IT used to be that when motorcycle riders reached a certain age where the bike was getting the better of them -- their sense of balance was fading, say, or their legs were starting to go and they found themselves tipping over unexpectedly at stop lights -- they would regretfully hang up their helmets and leather jackets and toddle  into four-wheeled retirement.</p>

        <p>IT used to be that when motorcycle riders reached a certain age where the bike was getting the better of them -- their sense of balance was fading, say, or their legs were starting to go and they found themselves tipping over unexpectedly at stop lights -- they would regretfully hang up their helmets and leather jackets and toddle  into four-wheeled retirement.</p>
        <p>But these days that is happening less and less.</p>
        <p>Instead of giving up the thrill of the wind in the face and the rip of those snarling exhaust pipes, many older motorcyclists are switching to a new hybrid machine called a trike -- typically a classic, big touring model with two wheels on the back instead of one, which just like a child's three-wheeler, makes riding much easier.</p>
        <p>Some wiseacres make fun of oldie-goldies needing training wheels. But the growing force of trikers, many of whom ride under the banner of an organization called Brothers of the Third Wheel, say their machines are safer and more relaxing to ride.</p>
        <p>''I don't get half as tired when we're on a long ride,'' said Jim Hart, 59, a retired bricklayer from Amherst, Va., as he swung aboard his metallic-green Honda trike dressed up with sheepskin-covered seats. ''And it's so smooth, my wife falls asleep.''</p>
        <p>Here at the biggest annual gathering of motorcyclists in the United States in March, the bulky trikes stood out among the swarms of bikes that filled the streets like  locusts. Other cyclists gawked at the trikes and even snapped pictures. The three-wheelers have begun to catch on only in the last few years, and remain a novelty. The trike riders seemed to like the attention.  But, most of all, they liked still being part of a sport that they otherwise would have been forced to abandon.</p>
        <p>Jerry Grimes, for one, would never have been here had he not discovered trikes. Mr. Grimes, who is in his mid-50's, had broken a leg in a crash on a gravel-strewn highway and said that he never again felt secure on two wheels. But the trike gave him back his confidence. Cruising the hundreds of miles to Daytona Beach from Hereford, Ariz., where he lives in semiretirement, he said, was even better than in the two-wheeled days.</p>
        <p>''Out on the interstate,'' he said one gloriously sunny afternoon here as he leaned in his short sleeves and leather vest against his candy-apple-red Kawasaki trike, ''the faster you go, the more stable it is.''</p>
        <p>And, of course, his most basic concerns are gone. ''With a trike,'' he said, ''you don't have to worry about falling over when you try to get on. And you don't worry any more about pebbles and rocks and sand on the road.''</p>
        <p>Frank Petrock, a 74-year-old retired painter for the city of Newark, switched to a trike after his two-wheeler toppled after he misjudged a dip in the pavement as he  eased to a stop. His wife, Faye, perched on the back, was thrown off and suffered a concussion. He said that he was going to quit riding. But Mrs. Petrock said that she insisted they get a trike.</p>
        <p>''We had a ball on two wheels,'' Mrs. Petrock explained as she and her husband waited with hundreds of other bikers to take their place in the traditional motorcycle parade on the final day of the rally here, ''and I didn't want to give it up. This is what keeps you young.''</p>
        <p>Trikes are as striking as they are utilitarian. With their aerodynamically sculptured fiberglass bodies lacquered to a sheen and trimmed in chrome, they can be as seductive to the eye as the most tricked-out custom car. And most of them are loaded with enough horsepower to cruise effortlessly well beyond the speed limit. On long, lonely stretches, many trike riders say that they think nothing of barreling along at 85 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>Trikes are pricey. Most of them cost nearly $30,000. One wild version, with a 502-cubic-inch V-8 engine slung under the rider's legs and a high-finned, pinstriped rearend that resembles a 50's Chevrolet, is $45,000. There is, however, a company that sells a light frame with two wheels for $3,695 that can be bolted on in a few minutes and provides stability, but not much flare. A trike with a four-cylinder Volkswagen engine mounted in the rear costs $15,500.</p>
        <p>All the trikes are custom jobs. Typically, a biker takes his standard touring bike, costing about $20,000, to one of the dozen or so trikemakers, who convert it to three wheels. The change takes about a week. For $6,000 to $12,000, depending on the frills, a trike shop lops off the rear wheel and frame of a customer's bike, then attaches a rear axle with two wheels, a suspension system and a substantial storage compartment, finishing off with fine paint and bodywork that leaves no scars.</p>
        <p>THE V-8 trikemakers and those that make trikes with Volkswagen and Harley V-twin engines mounted in the rear do not do conversions, but start from scratch and often end up with machines that look more like three-wheel cars than motorcycles. Some feature angular body styles that are anything but aerodynamic. But they are eye-catching. Even more so are the do-it-yourself jobs. Some look like dune buggies; a few have wooden bodies and decks. One here sported a fanciful fiberglass hood that protected the rider from rain and resembled a cobra coiling to strike. Regardless of such cosmetics, all three-wheelers qualify for motorcycle license tags and require a motorcycle driver's license.</p>
        <p>The complete, high-style trike produced by commercial builders, like the Trike Shop in Daytona Beach, Motor Trike of Troup, Tex., and Lehman Trikes of Westlock, Alberta, Canada, has the comforts of two-wheeled cruisers: radios and CD players with devices that increase volume as the roar of the engine and the whine of the wind grows louder; air-conditioners and heaters for the legs; cruise control; automatic gear boxes (or ones with five-speeds and sometimes reverse gear); and armrests, backrests and cup holders.</p>
        <p>''There are 75 million baby boomers entering into retirement,'' said Dick Lindholm, at his Trike Shop showroom here. ''That's our market.'' But Mr. Lindholm, who built his first Volkswagen-powered trike long before three-wheelers began to gain popularity in the mid-1990's, said that he also sells about a dozen trikes a year to people who have lost their legs or become partly paralyzed.</p>
        <p>The biggest V-8's, made by Boss Hoss, a company in Dyersburg, Tenn., attract fairly well-to-do ''hot-rod guys'' in their 40's and 50's ''who like horsepower,'' and a few very independent women, said Tom Shaffer, who owns Mountain Boss Hoss Cycles, a dealership in Somerset, Pa. He was chatting here in a pocket office in one of the vans he uses to haul Boss Hoss bikes and trikes to rallies.</p>
        <p>''Normal people don't call us,'' he said.</p>
        <p>LEHMAN Trikes makes a Harley Sportster trike that is smaller than most of the others, features a hard-as-rock seat and has almost no storage room. ''This one is made to look good,'' said Herb C. Anderson, Lehman's sales manager, as he showed it off. ''It's all about image.''</p>
        <p>While trikes are not as maneuverable as two-wheelers, riders and builders insist they are safer. Motorcyclists have always had a problem of being crunched -- sometimes fatally -- by cars whose drivers said that  they never saw the motorcycle. Trikes get less of that, the riders and builders say, because they are much bigger -- up to 12 feet long and 6 feet wide -- and, therefore, easier to see. Some safety experts say that older trike riders could be a danger to themselves and others as their vision and coordination diminish, just as that happens to older car drivers. So far, that has not been an issue.</p>
        <p>Trikes are built with low centers of gravity and, often, wide rear-wheel bases that allow them to hug the road and resist tipping. Unlike two-wheelers, they do not respond to a rider's shifting weight and cannot be leaned into a corner. ''On two wheels you're holding on for dear life,'' said Julie Meyers, 37, who works for a seed company in Madison, Ga., and rides a Volkswagen-powered trike with her husband Tom, 43, who is a carpenter with a trick knee. ''You don't have to fight the trike,'' she said.</p>
        <p>For decades, motorcyclists have been attaching sidecars to their bikes, essentially one-wheeled buggies that provide a third wheel and the ability to carry up to two passengers. But sidecars are often ungainly.  They also lack the pizazz of trikes.</p>
        <p>Ruth Anne Hannigan, who has been in the business of building sidecars for more than 15 years, said that for every person who buys a sidecar these days, six more are asking for trikes. So she and her husband, David, are building Hannigan Trikes in Murray, Ky.</p>
        <p>For all their beards and tattoos and silver-studded leather, the trikers, perhaps not surprisingly, are a much more sedate bunch than their two-wheeled counterparts. And they are proud of it.</p>
        <p>''Our people live in the suburbs,'' said  Marilyn Sickler of Moline, Ill., who, with her husband, Jim, a retired machinist at John Deere, founded Brothers of the Third Wheel. ''They're middle-  to upper-middle class. Their kids are grown. We don't do the biker thing, the wet T-shirts and so on.''</p>
