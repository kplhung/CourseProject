        <p>FIRST, Lindsay Nail had to find a girl in her class who would swap shoes. In her school district, which spans this city's eastern suburbs, driver-education teachers will not let students take the wheel in flip-flops, platform shoes or spike heels.</p>
        <p>Having borrowed a pair of sneakers, Lindsay, 16, faced a second crisis when she arrived at the DeKalb County drivers' course and found that she had been assigned a faded 1979 Datsun pickup truck with manual transmission. ''I can't drive a clutch,'' she called out the car window to an instructor, as she lurched into her third stall.</p>
        <p>It was a rare crack in her confidence.</p>
        <p>''I've had a lot of friends get in accidents,'' she said, ''and that's really scary.'' But when she drives her mother's Mazda, she feels steadily in control. Like most of her classmates, who were interviewed during a spring program at an asphalt training course on a quiet dead-end street, Lindsay said that she was a cautious driver.</p>
        <p>For the most part. ''It depends on if I'm in a hurry,'' she said. ''I got home from my boyfriend's last night in three minutes. Usually it takes seven, but I was late for curfew. But if there are other people in the car'' --  like her younger sister, whom she ferries to school -- ''I won't drive fast.''</p>
        <p>With thousands of newly minted teenage drivers on the road, there is ample reason to worry that some of them may lack the skills and judgment to take the wheel of their mother's Mazda, much less a three-ton sport utility vehicle. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, drivers in their teens are five times as likely as those between ages 40 and 65 to have accidents.</p>
        <p>But a surprising, if unscientific, conclusion emerged from recent interviews with two dozen 15- and 16-year-olds at driver- education classes in suburban Atlanta: as deeply as adult drivers fear them, teenage drivers fear adults.</p>
        <p>''Some adults drive worse than teenagers,'' said Kitrell Dalton, 15, who received her learner's permit in January. ''Some people act like they got their license at the grocery store for free, like they've never had a driving class or anything.''</p>
        <p>All the teenagers who were interviewed had stories about grown-ups who had cut them off on the highway, raced through red lights across their paths or burned rubber in their subdivisions. Growing up in a traffic-tangled boom town, most said they were learning to drive in less than ideal circumstances.</p>
        <p>During a class break at Nathan's Driving School, a private enterprise in nearby Roswell, several boys swapped the names of local roads where a driver leaving a parking lot between lights must accelerate from 0 to 50 just to catch up with traffic.</p>
        <p>Mike Strobel, 16, said the most frightening thing about learning to drive in his congested neighborhood was never having time to ask a question before making a decision: go for the left turn or brake on the yellow?</p>
        <p>His classmate Brad Rison, also 16, had been paying close attention as his driver- education teacher, Chris Purser, explained how to escape a high-speed ''wolf pack,'' in which the driver is in a center highway lane without an opening to the front, back or side. (Gradually adjust your speed and look for a safe space for changing lanes, they were told.)</p>
        <p>''This is why I'm in this course,'' Brad said. ''People do a lot of stupid stuff, like putting in their eyedrops while they're driving. You see people reading their newspapers, working on their laptops and talking on their cell phones. If they had a third arm they'd be eating, too.''</p>
        <p>That is not to let some of his peers off the hook. He and Mike ran through an inventory of classmates most likely to ''peel out'' of the school lot, and Brad recalled one who had been ticketed for hitting a car. ''Let's see, Chuck got a hit and run.''</p>
        <p>''That was Kenny,'' Mike corrected.</p>
        <p>''No, Chuck got one, too.''</p>
        <p>Brad and Mike also said they were nervous about friends who let themselves be distracted by music in the car. ''You want to get the best mix of songs so you don't have to change the CD while you're driving,'' Mike said.</p>
        <p>Brad added: ''I make my own mixes. I don't get any songs on them I don't like.''</p>
        <p>Daniel Yohannes, Lindsay's classmate and a 15-year-old son of a taxi driver, said he got a scare from a teacher on his first day of driving class. ''She told us that one in four of us would be the victim of an accident, and that hit me, like, dang,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Not that he hadn't been getting an earful from his mother. ''She's always throwing statistics out, and she watched this episode of 'Oprah' about teen drivers,'' he said. ''She said, 'I hope you don't act crazy when you've got your friends with you.' ''</p>
        <p>It is a legitimate concern: a recent study from the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health suggested that a teenage driver's likelihood of dying in an accident increased with each passenger in the car.</p>
        <p>Jessica Wals, 16, stopped short of saying that she used to be a road cowboy, but admitted that the only thing that made her change was having been in a wreck. She had been on her way to school, trying to make a left onto a main road, her view partly blocked by a bush.</p>
        <p>As she turned, she was thinking it was strange that the road was clear, given the timing of the lights. A car came from her left. ''He smashed right into my driver's- side door and I got hysterical,'' she said. Though she wasn't hurt, she said, she was changed.</p>
        <p>''I drive much more cautiously now,'' she said. ''When people start driving, they do not comprehend what a car can do.''</p>
        <p>Still, Jessica is surrounded by friends who continue to socialize and speed home ''under the influence,'' as Jennifer put it. ''Seriously, I know plenty of people who get brand-new cars, they get into wrecks, and their parents buy them another car,'' she said. ''So it just doesn't matter to them.''</p>
        <p>Trying Times At the Wheel</p>
        <p>ATLANTA -- A RUMBLY, crunching sound rose from beneath the moving Chevrolet Malibu. ''Are you hearing all that noise?'' the driver-education teacher, Paul Stouffer, asked the girl at the wheel. She seemed not to register the remark, but continued backing out of her parking space. When finally she braked, Mr. Stouffer pointed at the orange traffic cone she had flattened. ''It's mildly embarassing to do that to a cone at school,'' he said, dryly. ''But aren't there kids that size around?''</p>
        <p>Many of Renee Duff's classmates wore pointedly blase expressions as they prepared to go street-driving with instructors on an April morning. But Renee, 15, radiated apprehension as she locked her seat belt. This was only her third time driving, and Mr. Stouffer -- a 23-year veteran driving teacher in DeKalb County, Ga. -- kept his foot poised above the car's customized passenger side brake.</p>
        <p>As it turned out, Renee's problem was not recklessness, but hesitation. ''A little more gas, keep 'er going,'' Mr. Stouffer urged as she navigated a nearly empty neighborhood street at a turtle's pace. Then, a moment later, soothingly:</p>
        <p>''When you're arm-wrestling the wheel, you can't make those nice, gentle steering corrections. Renee, relax. You can't steer with your elbows way up there.''</p>
        <p>Even so, Mr. Stouffer had to hit the brakes himself three times during the 20-minute ride -- twice at stop signs and once at a red light. ''When students are that nervous,'' he said later, after Renee had driven back to school and was righting the cone, ''they go into brain lock. She thought because she saw the stop sign, the car was actually stopping.''</p>
        <p>Renee, though, was pleased at her growing mastery. ''Each time I do this,'' she said, ''it gets a little better.''</p>
