        <p>IN bringing his chain of meateries from Dallas to Midtown Manhattan, Terry White, the executive chef at Del Frisco's, introduced a special menu item just for New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>The Double Eagle strip steak (bone-in, 26 ounces).</p>
        <p>$49.95.</p>
        <p>For one. With nothing else on the plate but a smooth coat of butter -- and a little parsley.</p>
        <p>Is this the most expensive per-person steak in town? In recorded history?</p>
        <p>''We are offering the best that money can buy, and we're not shy about charging for it,'' said Mr. White, whose restaurant opened on West 49th Street a couple of months ago. ''We're in an age when people are trading cars in every two years, people are getting pedicures and manicures. They're taking care of themselves. They're living large. And we provide them with an atmosphere to live large.''</p>
        <p>He, and plenty more big-ticket restaurateurs in these big-ticket times. Has anyone looked at the column to the right of the entrees lately? Crazy numbers! A $32 cod at Picholine. Duck for $35 at Gotham Bar &amp; Grill. A $38.25 rack of lamb at Limoncello. Limoncello!</p>
        <p>Entrees used to hover politely under $30, with maybe a lobster or prime sirloin thrusting boldly beyond that old psychic and budget barrier, $29.95. Now you see menus with hardly anything under $30, and it's not necessarily buying four-star food, service or ambience. More modest neighborhood places are up there, too. Soft-shell crabs are $32 at Little Dove. Della Femina charges $44 for its veal rib chop. Decade, on First Avenue and 61st Street, wants $33 for a veal chop and is not even in Zagat.</p>
        <p>The $30 barrier has been broken in New York restaurants, quietly, with enough money around to muffle any noise about it. These places are packed. On the horizon is what may be the most expensive of them all. Alain Ducasse, the French chef with six Michelin stars, comes to the Essex House this summer with the possibility that his per-person rate might climb north of $200.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Ducasse said his New York prices had not been determined yet. But a Ducasse dinner in Paris can run as high as $215 a person, not including wine.</p>
        <p>Clark Wolf, a restaurant consultant based in Manhattan, said prices began spiking over the last year or two. ''Some people are just trying to see, 'Let's see how far I can go,' '' he said. ''Sometimes it's justified, and sometimes it's a rip-off.'' Mr. Wolf offered a few of the typical justifications for a $32 piece of fish. Food costs are up, as is rent. Competition for preternaturally picky New York diners has driven chefs to seek out the most rarefied ingredients, six-figure sommeliers, exotic architects.</p>
        <p>To hear the owner of Bayard's tell it, $33 for his halibut dish is barely enough to break even.</p>
        <p>''Garnishes aren't cheap,'' said Peter Poulakakos, who operates the restaurant, at 1 Hanover Square.</p>
        <p>''You've got potato on there. A lot of people are touching that plate. There are a lot of hands on that plate, and all those hands cost money. Even the plate it's on costs me $30 to $40.''</p>
        <p>Terrance Brennan, the chef and owner of Picholine on West 64th Street, decided almost two years ago that he wanted to upgrade. ''Then I had a couple of dishes breaking the $30 barrier,'' he said. ''I was very sensitive to it.'' But he increased his staff to 88 employees and took on an assistant sommelier and two ''cheese guys.''</p>
        <p>''To try and achieve this next level, you have to hire more experienced managers, which costs a lot more,'' he continued. ''And there's no other way except to raise prices.'' The butter clams served with his $32 cod cost $20 a pound from his supplier in Maine, he added, explaining, ''there's a lot behind the cod dish itself.''</p>
        <p>In the fall, Mr. Brennan will be serving a plate of white-truffle risotto for $100, a reasonable price, he argued, considering the high truffle content. ''I shave heavy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Picholine solicits feedback on customer comment cards. Complaints about cost come in rarely, Mr. Brennan said. ''I can't remember the last time I got a comment card that said prices are too high or anything like that,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In 1975, when a pleasure dome called the Palace opened with the unheard-of prix fixe of $50 a person, a reviewer for The New York Times suggested that a mob might string up the perpetrators on the nearest lamppost. No stars were given ''because of the impossibility of averaging quality and price in this instance,'' John Canaday wrote.</p>
        <p>In today's economy, admitting to being unable to afford a $36 entree might be considered rube behavior, or at least embarrassing. A certain caste of New Yorkers is experiencing ''bracket creep,'' said David Brooks, the author of the new ''Bobos in Paradise: The New Upper Class and How They Got There'' (Simon &amp; Schuster, $25).</p>
        <p>''As you rise to each new income and price bracket, you have total amnesia of what life was like at the previous bracket,'' Mr. Brooks said. The advent of fabulous cyberwealth has also had a trickle-down effect. ''People are adapting to the behavior of people who are beyond rich,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It is no secret that New York is an expensive place to eat. Del Frisco's pumped up its prices $1 or $2 when it opened here to cover what Mr. White, the executive chef, called ''the ambience, the rent, the total experience'' of his 16,400-square-foot cow palace. Rather than offer a huge steak for two, he went with the $49.95 steak for one, because his market research had revealed the startling fact that New Yorkers do not like to share.</p>
        <p>Gotham Bar &amp; Grill has never been cheap, but of 13 second courses listed on its current menu, only two of them weigh in at under $30: the Maine brook trout for $28.50 and organic free-range chicken for $28. In this context, a $28 chicken starts to look like a bargain.</p>
        <p>Alfred Portale, chef at Gotham for 16 years, recalled when his entrees ''started stacking up under $30'' -- maybe five years ago. ''I didn't want to go over $30, but I had to,'' he said. ''Now I feel the same way about $35.''</p>
        <p>Four of Mr. Portale's entrees have reached or broken that barrier: the Maine lobster tails ($37), roast rack of veal ($36), Chinese spiced duck breast ($35) and rack of lamb ($36).</p>
        <p>''I hate raising prices,'' he said. ''You're forced to.'' He said that his rent on East 12th Street doubled last year but that ''we don't try to capture that in the food costs.'' The reason, he said was ''super-expensive ingredients.'' Earlier this year, he switched from 21-day aged top choice beef (at $4.10 a pound wholesale) to prime (more than $6 a pound). He always used sushi-grade tuna ($5.50 to $6 a pound), but now it has to be belly ($10 a pound). His old Monini extra virgin olive oil ($70 for six one-liter bottles) isn't good enough anymore. He imports single-vineyard, organic olive oils from his wine purveyors ($140 for six half-liter bottles).</p>
        <p>Mr. Portale and Mr. Brennan run ambitious kitchens and dining rooms that can justify crossing the $30 border. But for a halibut dish at the brand-new Bayard's to be only $2 less than the $35 halibut at Restaurant Daniel, with no cheese cart or exclusive ingredients in the package, does not seem to be in the natural order of things.</p>
        <p>There is a formula for menu pricing. At most restaurants, between 30 and 35 percent of an entree's price is the food cost. This is usually an average. Forty percent on a steak is mitigated by 20 percent on chicken. Many chefs and owners said they make less money on their highest-priced entrees. Mr. Portale says he pays $14 for the duck in his $35 Chinese spiced duck breast. Kevin Penner, the executive chef and a partner at Della Femina, on East 54th Street, is ''not coming close to making money'' on his $42 cowboy steak, he said, adding, ''It should be $52 based on what it costs me.''</p>
        <p>Still, do customers ever blanch at breaking not only the $30 barrier, but $40?</p>
        <p>''We do get people in who perhaps suffer from a bit of sticker shock at times, and we're willing to work with them and split things,'' Mr. Penner said. ''Typically, they'll say something like, 'I'm not so hungry.' But they want to have the experience of saying they ate here and tell their friends.''</p>
        <p>At other restaurants, the price of admission almost seems like a membership fee, observed Mr. Wolf, the consultant.</p>
        <p>At Harry Cipriani, where chicken marsala sets back its Brioni-blazered diners $34.95, the staggering bills are ''as much about who's not welcome as who is,'' Mr. Wolf said.</p>
        <p>The Four Seasons restaurant also cultivates a clubby atmosphere of powerful money -- money that does not have to worry about a $46 Dover sole.</p>
        <p>Alex von Bidder, one of the restaurant's owners, said of eating there: ''You're renting a piece of real estate. The fish is unfortunately only a small part of the cost. There is the exquisite setting and the location.''</p>
        <p>Asked if the arrival of Mr. Ducasse and his expected hefty prix fixe would drag other restaurants up with him, Mr. von Bidder said, ''I really don't pay attention to what other people charge.''</p>
        <p>Jean-Georges Vongerichten, who owns five New York restaurants, estimated that Mr. Ducasse's prix fixe would probably be in the $150 to $200 range. ''He's going to be in a class of his own,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vongerichten charges a $125 prix fixe for dinner at Jean Georges. But at Nougatine, his casual cafe attached to Jean Georges, lobster lemon risotto is $34. At a table with hardly enough room under it to cross your legs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vongerichten bemoaned the high cost of running a high-end establishment. ''If you don't spend $3 million on the design and construction, you have nothing serious anymore,'' he said. A 10-year loan of $8 million to $10 million means at least $1 million a year in payments. Running the numbers in his mental calculator, he added, ''Some places are paying $500,000 in rent, a chef costs $100,000 -- and they'll probably close after six months.''</p>
        <p>One New York restaurateur whose wings have been singed is Frank Valenza, the owner of Two Two Two on West 79th Street -- and 25 years ago, the Palace. Last week Mr. Valenza announced that he was lowering his prices. His $59 prix fixe is $39 a person. A la carte entrees that were $32 to $49 are now $24 to $42. Gone from the new menu is the 16-ounce Kobe sirloin for $180.</p>
        <p>''We used to get stockbrokers pulling up in their limos, and that's kind of died down,'' Mr. Valenza said. ''So what do you do?''</p>
        <p>At the Palace, Mr. Valenza, who came to food from a theatrical background, gave customers ice sculptures of a fisherman with nets full of caviar. To attract clientele back to Two Two Two, he has once again mustered his flair for showmanship. On display in the entrance area of the restaurant is his wife's Barbie collection.</p>
        <p>He's throwing that in free.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 19, 2000, Friday  An article on Wednesday about rising prices in Manhattan restaurants misstated the cost of the prix fixe menu at Jean Georges. It is $85, not $125.</p>
