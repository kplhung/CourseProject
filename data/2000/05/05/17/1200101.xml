        <p>Anglo American P.L.C., the world's largest mining company, announced today that Julian Ogilvie Thompson, the last of a generation of managers who dominated the South African-led company during and beyond the apartheid era, would step down as chief executive in July.</p>

        <p>Anglo American P.L.C., the world's largest mining company, announced today that Julian Ogilvie Thompson, the last of a generation of managers who dominated the South African-led company during and beyond the apartheid era, would step down as chief executive in July.</p>
        <p>The move came as the giant corporation accelerated efforts to remold itself by shedding diverse businesses one year after having moved its primary stock exchange listing from Johannesburg to the far larger market in London.</p>
        <p>Since then, the company has faced shareholder criticism that it was moving too slowly to expand beyond Africa and divest itself of a hodgepodge of subsidiaries that had little relevance to its main mining and natural resources businesses.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ogilvie Thomson, 66, told the company's annual meeting that he would be replaced as chief executive by Tony Trahar (pronounced TRAY-er), 50, who currently heads Anglo's forest products and industrial minerals divisions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ogilvie Thompson, who held the titles of both chairman and chief executive, sought to assure investors today that the company would speed up disposals of industrial and financial services divisions.</p>
        <p>Anglo shares, which have lagged the shares of other mining companies, rose 1.4 percent, to 2,945 pence.</p>
        <p>The change at the top took some analysts by surprise because, in the past, Anglo had pledged only to split the roles of chairman and chief executive by 2002. ''It's clear that there's a generational change,'' said a mining executive who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ogilvie Thomson joined Anglo in 1957. Known to his staff by the acronym J.O.T., he is viewed in South African business circles as a member of a charmed circle of Oxford-educated managers who prospered under the company's founding Oppenheimer family.</p>
        <p>In the 1980's, Anglo grew into an opaque conglomerate of broad interests. But, particularly as it moved toward a London listing last year, the company faced a clamor from shareholders for a simpler structure. Indeed, Mr. Ogilvie Thompson oversaw 60 transactions worth a total of $2.5 billion over the last three years aimed at addressing shareholder concerns. But it was not considered sufficient.</p>
        <p>''Most investors want everything yesterday,'' said Daniel Major, an analyst with HSBC Securities. ''They said Anglo wasn't moving fast enough and that's a bit unfair. They have gone through a fair chunk of disposals, and they have gone a long way to answer investor criticism.''</p>
        <p>Anglo also said today that it was selling stakes in South African electronics companies for $45 million. Anglo also said its Mondi paper and pulp unit would spend $262 million buying out minority stakes in the paper and packaging firms Neusiedler and Frantschach, and a further $516 million on the Swedish sack business AssiDoman. Anglo also said its base metals division would invest $110 million to expand zinc production in the Black Mountain mine in South Africa.</p>
