        <p>City Council Speaker Peter Vallone yesterday renewed his call for a city-sponsored police watchdog panel, which he said would discourage federal intervention in local police affairs.</p>

        <p>City Council Speaker Peter Vallone yesterday renewed his call for a city-sponsored police watchdog panel, which he said would discourage federal intervention in local police affairs.</p>
        <p>''An independent monitor would do the trick, and it should be our own monitor,'' Mr. Vallone said. He made his remarks in response to Police Commissioner Howard Safir's 700-page rebuttal to accusations of racial profiling and other police misconduct that were made in a draft report by the United States Civil Rights Commission.</p>
        <p>The Police Department said the draft was flawed and selective in its use of facts, and relied too heavily on perennial critics of the Police Department, like the Rev. Al Sharpton.</p>
        <p>''They could have saved 700 pages of response if this independent monitor had been in place,'' Mr. Vallone said. He warned that the federal investigation would lead to continued scrutiny by the Justice Department. ''We are going to end up with an independent monitor anyway,'' he said. ''It might as well be our own.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vallone also called for the mayor to drop his opposition to legislation the Council passed last year that would create the Independent Police Investigation and Audit Board. The proposed five-member panel would provide a confidential forum for police officers to report evidence of corruption or brutality.</p>
        <p>The board would have authority to issue subpoenas and recommend criminal charges to the city's five district attorneys. The mayor and the City Council have been battling in court over versions of the panel.</p>
        <p>The watchdog panel would be separate from the Civilian Complaint Review Board, which is authorized to investigate complaints from outside the department.</p>
        <p>The law the Council passed last year granted the mayor broad power over selecting members of the Investigation and Audit Board, and was upheld in September by the State Supreme Court in Manhattan. That ruling is being appealed by the mayor and District Attorney Robert M. Morgenthau of Manhattan, who say it would undermine their power. Mr. Vallone sent letters to both yesterday, asking that they withdraw litigation to block the board.</p>
        <p>Investigating police corruption ''is the job of the district attorney, and that is where the authority ought to reside,'' said James M. Kindler, the chief assistant to Mr. Morgenthau, in an interview yesterday. He said the appeal of last year's court ruling would probably be decided by the end of December.</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir also rejected Mr. Vallone's proposal yesterday, saying, ''This is the most independently monitored police department in the United States.''</p>
        <p>At City Hall, Steven Fisher, the mayor's criminal justice coordinator, issued a statement saying the proposal ''violates the city charter and is subject to pending litigation.''</p>
