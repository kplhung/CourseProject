        <p>THE Internet has changed the ways that people order new cars and bid on old ones. Now Web entrepreneurs are out to change the way you fill your gas tank.</p>
        <p>Several Web sites are offering services aimed at trimming the cost of a fill-up -- and just in time, too, since motorists face the prospect of entering the peak summer travel season with prices 35 cents a gallon higher than they were a year ago.</p>
        <p>The Internet broker Priceline.com, known for offering discount airline tickets and hotel rooms, is opening a gasoline-buying service that will try to help consumers cut deals for cheaper fuel.</p>
        <p>And Carclub.com, a Web site operated by J. D. Power &amp; Associates, the automotive and consumer-product marketing company, is giving members a 10 percent discount on gasoline through the rest of 2000.</p>
        <p>Other companies offer discounts to frequent purchasers or operate Web sites that help consumers find stations in their area that are selling the cheapest gasoline.</p>
        <p>Nationally, the price of a gallon of unleaded gasoline last week stood at  $1.492 a gallon, up 7.2 cents in just the last two weeks. (In metropolitan New York, the price of a gallon of self-service unleaded gasoline was $1.60, according to the most recent survey conducted April 19 by the Automobile Club of New York.) Last year at this time, the national average was $1.14 a gallon. Historically, gasoline prices rise in spring and early summer, as millions of motorists make vacation trips.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, Priceline.com will begin mailing blue Gas Cards to the one million people who have already registered on its Web site. The program is modeled after Priceline.com's WebHouse Club grocery-buying service, started in November, which lets consumers name their price for food and dry goods, prepay for the order, then purchase their selections at a participating supermarket using a green WebHouse Club card.</p>
        <p>Gasoline sales will start June 20, said Robert Padgett, a spokesman for Priceline.com. Gas Card participants will go to Priceline.com's site and enter a per-gallon bid for unleaded gasoline in one of three grades: regular, midgrade or premium. Priceline.com tells consumers to expect discounts of 10 to 20 cents a gallon off local prices, though an occasional dealer may agree to a better offer.</p>
        <p>Once the bid is accepted, customers can prepay for up to 50 gallons of gasoline. They will purchase the fuel with their Gas Card, either directly at the pump or inside the service station. The card can be used only at self-service bays. If pump prices fall below the prepaid level, Priceline.com will give club members a credit for the difference.</p>
        <p>Mr. Padgett said merchants would be paid the full pump price. Price line.com is making up the difference by selling advertising space on its gas site, the first time it has done so on one of its sites. The service will be offered free for the first 90 days. After that, Gas Card members will pay a $3 monthly handling charge. Mr. Padgett could not estimate how many gas stations were participating in the nationwide service.</p>
        <p>J. D. Power's Carclub.com is also using stored-value cards. Its Gas MasterCard is sent to each customer who pays a $5.99 monthly fee. This covers the gas discount and other services, including a payment of up to $500 for a member's insurance deductible in case of an accident, advice from a mechanics' hot line and free directions from its ''Help, I'm Lost'' 24-hour customer assistance center.</p>
        <p>Carclub.com expects 250,000 members by year's end.</p>
