        <p>Tim Hardaway looked around the locker room in the afterglow of the Miami Heat's victory in Game 5 on Wednesday night.</p>
        <p>''There's no smiling,'' he said. ''Everybody is dead serious. Check it out. We're going to New York to end it.''</p>
        <p>The Heat, which leads the playoff series against the Knicks three games to two, is passionately mindful that the Knicks have ended the team's season with first-round knockouts the last two years, particularly last year when Allan Houston's winning shot bounced off the glass and tantalizingly off the rim before falling through the net with 0.8 seconds remaining.</p>
        <p>''The memory of that shot is still there, big-time,'' P. J. Brown said today at American Airlines Arena before the Heat flew to New York for Game 6 on Friday night. ''A lot of heartache and pain went with it. Now we have a chance to close them out at the Garden. To say the least, it would be a real good feeling to do that.''</p>
        <p>Coach Pat Riley put it another way.</p>
        <p>''It's time,'' he said. ''We've been through a lot. There's not going to be any real words by me or videos. It's going to be straight up and straight down. It's time for us to step up and move on.''</p>
        <p>Alonzo Mourning wants his teammates to go into the Garden with a feeling of desperation, to play as if the Heat trailed in the series. He tried that approach in Game 2 after the Heat won Game 1, and it failed.</p>
        <p>''When we have a cushion we tend to relax and kind of exhale,'' Mourning said. ''I think if we go in with an attitude that it's a must-win situation, we'll be able to finish it out. It's a matter of carrying that mentality over from Wednesday's game.''</p>
        <p>Mourning is aware that the Heat has won six of the nine games played between the teams this season, including three of four in the regular season.</p>
        <p>''We have found ways to beat this team throughout the course of the year,'' he said. ''But we have to learn to play better on the road. That is our challenge.''</p>
        <p>The Heat also seems to feel that the team must prove it can end the Knicks' season at the Garden -- with all the hostility and history it represents -- in order to be a serious contender for the National Basketball Association championship.</p>
        <p>''This is our chance to show we can close a series with championship quality,'' Brown said. ''And I think we're ready to go out and play our best game of this series.''</p>
        <p>Should the Knicks win Friday, the decisive game would be Sunday at Miami. The Heat has had too many disappointing finishes against the Knicks to want to risk a Game 7.</p>
        <p>''It's not a security blanket to us because it hasn't proven successful,'' Dan Majerle said. ''We have to go to New York with the mindset that we want to end it there and not leave it to one game.''</p>
        <p>A season ago, the Knicks had a 24-rebound advantage in eliminating the Heat in five games. This time, the Heat has 40 more rebounds than the Knicks.</p>
        <p>''That was our No. 1 priority going into the series,'' Riley said. ''I think that's what got us beat last year. The difference is simply big muscle. It's concentration. It's blocking out.''</p>
        <p>Riley is particularly happy that the Knicks' offensive rebounding has been minimized. They have been held to fewer than 20 second-chance points in each of the Heat's three victories.</p>
        <p>''It's time,'' the coach said.</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>PAT RILEY took exception to Knicks Coach JEFF VAN GUNDY's criticism of the officials in Wednesday's game for allowing such a disparity of free throws: 27 for Miami and 12 for the Knicks. Riley figured Van Gundy was already working the officials to get an edge in Friday's game. Riley pointed out that six of the Heat's free throws came after intentional fouls by the Knicks. ''We actually attacked more than they did, the first time that's happened in the series,'' Riley said. ''So from that standpoint, we deserved what we got. I just hope this series is left between the players. Let them settle it. I hope there isn't any kind of external thing that comes in here to change that.''</p>
