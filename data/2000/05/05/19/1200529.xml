        <p>The designer Tibor Kalman was a jack of several trades who deliberately avoided mastering any of them. This, at least, is the impression conveyed by the vivid, if motley, exhibition at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo.</p>
        <p>''Tiborocity'' was organized by Kalman in collaboration with Aaron Betsky, curator of architecture, design and digital products at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. It became a memorial tribute after the designer died last May at 49, after a four-year battle with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and just two months before the show opened in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>It is probably not by chance that ''Tiborocity'' rhymes with ferocity. Kalman was often called the bad boy of graphic design. He considered professional a pejorative word and bad a compliment, and he said he was as involved with undesign as with design. He boasted of his short attention span and his outsider status, and he liked to be called a contrarian and a provocateur.</p>
        <p>Born in Budapest in 1949, he immigrated with his family to upstate New York in 1958, but even as a successful self-made adult he considered himself a communist ''in theory.'' Kalman was known equally for his social conscience (which he honed as a student radical at New York University in the late 1960's), his large ego and the clever Christmas gifts that his influential and iconoclastic design company, M&amp;Co, sent clients. One year the gift consisted of the meager box lunch distributed in New York City homeless shelters on Christmas Day, along with an offer to match any donations to charitable organizations.</p>
        <p>Kalman emerged at a time when multinational corporations were changing the face of the world and multicultural theory was altering our understanding of it. He tried to play one against the other, most notably in Colors, a magazine (and ''unadvertisement''?) that he created for Benetton, the Italian clothing manufacturer, and edited for 13 issues from 1991 to 1995, when his illness was diagnosed.</p>
        <p>Like the architect Robert Venturi, Kalman saw local, vernacular design as a weapon against the homogenizing effects of ''corporate modernism.'' He also argued that since advertising and corporate signage was so prevalent, it should be socially responsible, and he urged designers to be more aware of the ways the corporations they served were exploiting labor or the environment. He liked to remind them that, minus the packaging and ad campaigns, most competing products are nearly identical. Pepsi equals Coke. Nike equals Reebok.</p>
        <p>Kalman was not exactly a household word, but his handiwork was visible on several fronts. In the area of chic and hip, his clients included the fashion designer Isaac Mizrahi, Interview magazine, the restaurant Florent and the Talking Heads, whose first album covers M&amp;Co designed. His early work includes the medieval-style image on the shopping bag (still in use) that he designed for Barnes &amp; Noble, where he started his career working in the basement at 18 and finished it 12 years later as creative director. One of several tangents includes the titles and credits of movies like ''Something Wild,'' ''Matewan'' and ''The Silence of the Lambs,'' as well as the designs of two exhibitions, ''City of Ambition'' and ''Keith Haring,'' at the Whitney Museum.</p>
        <p>Much of what Kalman and his many collaborators wrought seems to be in this show: the Talking Heads albums, the M&amp;Co Christmas presents, a remake of the enormous temporary street-level billboard he created for Times Square that simply announced ''Everybody'' in letters one story high and was punctuated with chairs that passersby could sit on. One high point is a music video for the Talking Heads' song ''(Nothing But) Flowers,'' in which the lyrics are inventively insinuated onto the screen and stark social statistics are presented in subliminal flashes. There are moments of linguistic and typographic genius, like ''&amp;derson,'' the logo for Ross Anderson Architects.</p>
        <p>Kalman was only a little younger than the generation of Conceptual artists who began working in New York in the mid-1960's. It would be presumptuous to say they influenced him, but there is a common sensibility, an interest in the play of vivid images and cryptic language, in irreverence and in the power of information and fact, carefully assembled and collated.</p>
        <p>This sensibility was most pronounced in Kalman's dream job, for which he closed M&amp;Co and moved to Rome: Benetton's offer -- carte blanche, with a big budget -- to create a magazine for ''the rest of the world.'' It is not clear whether that is exactly what Kalman achieved, but Colors, which he called the first global magazine, was a fascinating experiment in the power of images. Alternately hectoring and seductive, it was intended to entertain while raising the consciousness of the 25-and-under set, and it devoted issues to race, AIDS, religion and ecology. In fact, it often resembles a hipper-than-thou version of National Geographic; that is, it presents the exoticism of the ''rest of the world'' for middle-class westerners and romanticizes poverty.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the pungent pages of Colors provide many of the show's high points. Kalman proved as good at aphorisms as Jenny Holzer, an artist he worked with and admired. ''Wealth Is Poverty.'' ''Consumer culture is a contradiction in terms.'' Sometimes he seemed to sharpen the edge of an existing idea: in the race issue, Queen Elizabeth II is depicted with a dark skin, similar to Andy Warhol's pastel-colored images of Mao from the early 1970's and the blue-faced Nixon of his 1972 ''Vote McGovern'' poster.</p>
        <p>The show is as much a self-portrait as a retrospective. It includes the entrancing children's books written and drawn by Maira Kalman, his wife and sounding board, as well as the source of the M in M&amp;Co. Also here is a large display stocked with examples of vernacular design from the 1940's and 50's that the couple accumulated over the years, along with a few fakes -- Utz potato chips? -- that Kalman designed himself. Nearby is his collection of fried onion rings, arranged on a bulletin board. Finally, a short film shows the designer four months before his death, on the telephone in the hospital, asking someone to ''bring me a bunch of literature about wheelchairs.''</p>
        <p>There is plenty of evidence here that most graphic design has a limited shelf life, and that even socially conscientious designers can create a fair number of useless baubles and knickknacks. (As can the art world, where they are usually called multiples.) But perhaps this is merely proof that Kalman's most lasting legacy will be his provocative ideas, and the independence and questioning spirit he brought to his work. Exposure to them is invigorating.</p>
        <p>''Tiborocity: Design and Undesign by Tibor Kalman, 1979-1999'' is at the New Museum of Contemporary Art, 583 Broadway, near Prince Street, SoHo, (212) 219-1222, through Aug. 20.</p>
