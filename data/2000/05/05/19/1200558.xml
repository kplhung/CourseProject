        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy pop and jazz concerts in the New York metropolitan region this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended concert.</p>
        <p>* ABDELLI, Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400 or (212) 545-7536. Abderrahmane Abdelli is a Berber from the Kabylia region of Algeria, descended from the people who inhabited North Africa before the Arabs and Islam arrived in the seventh century. A perpetual minority in Algeria, the Kabyle Berbers have held onto their own traditions in Algeria and as immigrants elsewhere; Mr. Abdelli has lived in Belgium since 1987 and has made an album for Real World Records. He accompanies himself on the mandola (a larger mandolin) and sings -- in a voice quivering with passion -- about the pain of exile and the tenacity of Berber traditions. This is his New York debut. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $26 (Jon Pareles).</p>

Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $26 (Jon Pareles).</p>
        <p>* BANGS, SARAH DOUGHER, THE TURNOFFS, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3055. The bright and dark sides of female self-expression receive full attention on this bill of indie pop based in the Northwest. Bangs is a band that rocks with the top down, making a noise as fresh as early summer. Sarah Dougher, who also plays in the Crabs and Cadallaca but flies solo tonight, has a more rueful sound; she is always aware that summer has to end. With the Turnoffs. Sunday night at 9; admission is $8 (Ann Powers).</p>
        <p>MARC CARY TRIO, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. Mr. Cary, originally from Washington, put in time as a sideman with three of the best teachers in the last quarter-century of jazz: the drummer Art Taylor and the singers Betty Carter and Abbey Lincoln. On his own he's energetic and quirky, moving between state-of-the-art mainstream jazz piano trio material (in which all three members seem to be soloing at once), groove-based music and even left turns like Erik Satie's ''Gymnopedies.'' Sets through Sunday night are at 9 and 11, with a 12:30 a.m. set tonight and tomorrow; cover charge is $20 tonight and tomorrow night, $17.50 on Sunday, plus a $10 minimum for all sets (Ben Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* CHOCOLATE GENIUS, BAM Cafe, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4139. Marc Anthony Thompson, a k a Chocolate Genius, writes desolate, telling, unsparing songs about goodbyes, from doomed romances to senile parents. He has a husky voice and a superb band (including Marc Ribot on guitar and John Medeski on keyboards) that can put a subtle jazz swing into his twilight ballads; in a way he's the East Coast's answer to Mark Eitzel. Tonight at 9; no cover, $10 minimum (Pareles).</p>
        <p>DILATED PEOPLES, S.O.B's, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. ''It takes respect to perfect the art form,'' say the rappers in this Los Angeles-based crew, and Iriscience, Evidence and D.J. Babu have that in abundance. The sound is old school with a hazy West Coast groove, the rhyming precise and energetic. Babu is a battle winner known for his work with the World Famous Beat Junkiez, but he might gain a bigger reputation with these rising underground stars. Tonight at 9; admission is $18 (Powers).</p>
        <p>''DRAWN TO DEATH: A THREE-PANEL OPERA,'' Church of St. Ann and the Holy Trinity, 157 Montague Street, at Clinton Street, Brooklyn Heights, (718) 858-2424. Art Spiegelman, the comics artist who won a Pulitzer Prize for his ''Maus'' books, has come up with an opera about American comics from their birth in the 1930's to their censorship in the 1950's, when hysteria over juvenile delinquency was channeled toward comics and rock 'n' roll. The music is by Philip Johnston, a jazz composer. Tonight at 8; tickets are $20 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* EX-GIRL, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7504, and Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. A three-woman group from Tokyo, eX-Girl plays it cute and punky, with songs that seesaw from giddy synthesizer pop and Go-Go's harmonies to raucous guitar wrangles. At Tonic tonight at midnight; admission is $4. At the Mercury Lounge, the group opens for Man or Astro-Man (see below) tomorrow night at 8:30; admission is $10 in advance, $12 on the day of the show (Pareles).</p>
        <p>EMINEM, METHOD MAN AND REDMAN, NAS, GINUWINE, BLACK ROB, RAH DIGGA, Nassau Coliseum, Uniondale, N.Y., (516) 794-9300. The latest hip-hop arena tour brings together fantasies of mayhem, crime, sexual conquest and ghetto heroism. Eminem is a blond, whiny-voiced brat spinning tall tales about psychotic behavior; Method Man and Redman mix apocalyptic tidings and comedy. Nas and Black Rob aim for gangsta-rap realism, while Rah Digga toughs it out on male turf, calling herself ''creme de la gutter.'' Ginuwine, a singer, adds some slow-grinding come-ons. Tonight at 7; tickets are $58.50 to $68.50. (Pareles).</p>
        <p>FIDDLERS ON FIRE, Wunsch Student Center, Polytechnic University, 311 Bridge Street, downtown Brooklyn, (718) 429-3437. Bluegrass certainly isn't native to New York, but it has some strong practitioners in the city. The fiddlers Kenny Kosek, Bob Mastro and Travis Wetzel delve into both the speedy delights of bluegrass and the jaunty ease of swing; they'll be backed by a trio led by Orrin Star on banjo. Tonight at 8; tickets are $12 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>HAROLD LAND-BILLY HIGGINS QUINTET, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232. Two West Coasters who have recently made a regular practice of visiting Manhattan, Mr. Land and Mr. Higgins are steeped in jazz of the 1960's. Mr. Land, on tenor saxophone, has had a career that's moved through rhythm-and-blues, orthodox bebop and John Coltrane's chordally based playing, where you'll find him at present. Mr. Higgins's drumming is pure bliss: he just zeroes in on how to swing a band, no matter who or when. He did it on some of Ornette Coleman's greatest records, and he did it for a long stretch of the 1980's and 90's with the pianist Cedar Walton. Sets tonight and tomorrow night are at 8, 10:30 and midnight, with a cover charge of $25 for first two sets, $18 for the midnight set; Sunday night sets are at 7 and 9, with a cover charge of $18 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>ABBEY LINCOLN QUARTET, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592. The 90's were a fantastic decade for Ms. Lincoln: with a series of unforgettable recordings and some steady working bands full of young musicians, she proved herself to be one of those figures whose shows are always worth seeing. Her voice is a kind of truth machine: with its dire, mournful shadings, it doesn't sing a corny note. Sets are tonight through Sunday at 9 and 11:30; cover charge is $30 plus a $5 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>* JOE LOVANO NONET, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037. Is there a jazz musician working more and consistently better than Joe Lovano? He keeps appearing in new groups; in the last few years, he has played in a first-rate, open-ended trio, in tandem groups with the saxophonist Greg Osby and the guitarist Jim Hall, in quartets and quintets, and in countless guest appearances. He's a gusty, swinging player and a generous and studied musician. This new group has him working through ballads and be-bop-era standards in carefully arranged settings with some of New York's best musicians. Sets through Sunday night are at 9:30 and 11:30, with a 1 a.m. set tonight and tomorrow night; cover charge is $20 (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>JACKIE McLEAN SEXTET, Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080. Mr. McLean may make his home in Connecticut, but his biting alto saxophone sound is pure, tough-as-nails late 50's New York. An educator and something of a hero to young musicians who pass through the Hartt School of Music, Mr. McLean leads a band that has produced next-generation musicians including the drummer Eric McPherson and the saxophonist Jimmy Greene. Sets are tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11; cover charge is $30 plus a $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>MAN OR ASTRO-MAN, Mercury Lounge, 217 East Houston Street, at Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212) 260-4700. The most high-concept surf-rock band around, Man or Astro-Man has its own sci-fi mythology, complete with clones and alien encounters. Tonight at midnight and tomorrow night at 10:30, with Enon and eX-Girl opening at 8:30 tomorrow night; admission is $12. Man or Astro-Man also plays on Monday night at 8:30 at Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406; admission is $10 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* MIRIAM MAKEBA, City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212 or (212) 571-1555. The Center for Traditional Music and Dance puts on an annual concert called ''Badenya'' featuring African musicians who now live in New York City. This year it has a guest: Miriam Makeba, the extraordinary South African singer who became the voice of the anti-apartheid movement. Her voice is still remarkable, holding girlish joy along with grown-up regrets; she moves through traditional and pop songs, riding the bounce of South African township rhythms. Also on the bill are four musicians performing jali, or griot, songs from the Senegambia region and Ola Jagun Ancestral Rhythms, playing the Yoruba songs that are at the roots of Afro-Caribbean music. Tomorrow night at 8; tickets are $25 to $45 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* JAMES MOODY AND MARK TURNER, Iridium, 44 West 63rd Street, Manhattan, (212) 582-2121. The two saxophonists, who have about a 40-year gap between them, appear in a reprise of a very successful and barely noticed recording they made three years ago. It's a gig for the connoisseurs as well as the sybarites: both players know how to fuse the chill of sophisticated harmony with the warmth of gut-level projection. Sets are tonight through Sunday night at 8:30 and 10:30; cover charge is $25 plus a $10 minimum (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>L. J. MURPHY, LAURA CANTRELL AND FRIENDS, SHACKWACKY, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, at Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7503. It should be a cozy night on the Lower East Side with these roots-loving singer-songwriters. L. J. Murphy strums folk and blues hipster style; Laura Cantrell, host of WFMU's ''Radio Thrift Shop,'' is always ready for the country. Make sure to catch Shackwacky, the renowned trio of Angel Dean, Lianne Smith and Phil Dray, in one of its semi-regular reunions. Sunday night at 8; admission is $10 (Powers).</p>
        <p>* LUCY PEARL, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. This new band combines three talents so serious it hurts to think about it: Raphael Saadiq, once of the band Tony! Toni! Tone!; Dawn Robinson, formerly of the diva squad En Vogue; and Ali Shaheed Mohammad, a hip-hop hero in A Tribe Called Quest. The album lives up to expectations in terms of catchiness and creativity. Can they do it live? Why wouldn't they be able to? Sunday night at 8; admission is $25 (Powers).</p>
        <p>RESPECT IS BURNING, Twilo, 530 West 27th Street, Chelsea, (212) 268-1600. This monthly night devoted to bouncy, glittery house music is named after a Paris club event and is headlined by the Paris disc jockey Alex Gopher. It includes some English-speaking disc jockeys who add some intrigue to the house beat: Pete Heller and Miss Honey Dijon. There is also a live performance by Rinocerose, a French band that adds live guitars and flute to its programmed house rhythms. Tonight at 11; admission is $25 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>* MARC RIBOT Y LOS CUBANOS POSTIZOS, Knitting Factory, 74 Leonard Street, TriBeCa, (212) 219-3006. The guitarist Marc Ribot started Los Cubanos Postizos (''the prosthetic Cubans'') to play songs he loves from Cuba in the 1940's and 50's from the repertory of Arsenio Rodriguez; he honors the tunes but isn't afraid to add some downtown clank and down-home twang in his solos. Tonight and tomorrow night at 9 and 11; admission is $14. (Pareles).</p>
        <p>YONDO SISTER, S.O.B.'s, 204 Varick Street, at Houston Street, South Village, (212) 243-4940. Even African pop has its video stars, and Yondo Sister is one of them. She is a dancer turned singer whose ''Sexy Soukous'' was a sensation in Paris. While she's a passable singer, she leads a superb soukous band that backs up her hip-swiveling action with buoyant rumba rhythms and endless, gleaming strings of intertwined guitar lines. Tonight at midnight; tickets are $20 (Pareles).</p>
        <p>SWINGIN' NECKBREAKERS, INSOMNIACS, LES SEXAREENOS, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-0406. The Swingin' Neckbreakers are the standard-bearers of revivalist garage rock, with a trunkful of vintage cover tunes and originals that match the oldies for sheer growl. Insomniacs are another band that records for Estrus, the garage haven in Bellingham, Wash. Les Sexareenos earns the ''ones to watch'' ribbon with their hip-shaking tributes to Sam the Sham. Tonight at 10; admission is $7 (Powers).</p>
        <p>TANGUARDIA, BAM Cafe, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4139. Bob Telson, the composer of ''The Gospel at Colonnus'' and the globe-hopping ''Warrior Ant,'' has turned to the tango, playing piano with a group that also includes bandoneon (the Argentine accordion) and guitar. Tomorrow night at 9; no cover, $10 minimum (Pareles).</p>
        <p>TOOTS AND THE MAYTALS, Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, at 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 777-6800. Toots Hibbert was the first Jamaican singer to put the term reggae in a song title; his ''Do the Reggay'' came out in 1968, when the rhythm was brand-new. He is reggae's long-running soul man, applying the gruff, gospel exuberance of Otis Redding to tales of prison, love, dancing and redemption; his version even redeemed the John Denver hit ''Take Me Home, Country Roads.'' Tomorrow night at 9; tickets are $20 in advance, $22 tomorrow (Pareles).</p>
        <p>UPPER CRUST, Brownies, 169 Avenue A, between 10th and 11th Streets, East Village, (212) 420-8392. It's amazing that the aspiring monarchists in this Boston-based joke band have kept their powdered wigs on so long; the group developed its concept of aristocrat rock in 1994. Its commitment must stem from its genuine ability to play basic, fun, trashy rock. Tonight at 9 with Heartdrops and Girltoucher; Tomorrow night at 9 with Gravel Pit and Brought Low. Admission is $8 (Powers).</p>
        <p>* VISION FESTIVAL, New Age Cabaret, 23 St. Marks Place, East Village, (212) 473-0043. It's the fifth annual supernova of New York's experimental jazz scene, still without a corporate sponsor, still a great example of grass-roots organization around a common aesthetic cause. That cause has been called ''ecstatic jazz'' and ''avant jazz''; it's often typified by collective improvisation and pin-your-ears-to-the-wall intensity, but that's by no means the only dish on this year's 11-day menu. Tonight, opening night, is a strong bill: an invocation by the saxophonist Joseph Jarman; a group led by the drummer Reggie Nicholson, who helped make Charles Gayle's early records so listenable; a trio of the bassist Peter Kowald, the trombonist Conrad Bauer and the drummer Gunter Sommer, three German improvisers who don't often make it to New York; the drummer Sunny Murray, improvising with the bassist William Parker and the pianist Matthew Shipp; and the saxophonist Mark Whitecage's quartet, which mixes experimental jazz with electronics. Tomorrow's bill includes the saxophonist Dewey Redman's quartet, whose sets -- nestled somewhere between the traditional and the radical -- are sheer fun, and a choir led by the pianist and composer Cooper Moore. Sunday evening has a violin theme: it includes the 90-plus Claude Williams; a quintet led by the charismatic free improviser Mat Maneri; a multimedia piece including the violinist Leroy Jenkins, the dancer Felicia Norton and the artist Michael Brian; and a final set by the violinist Billy Bang, with the bassist Sirone and the drummer Abbey Radar. All programs last from 7 p.m. to 1 a.m. Through May 29. Tickets are $20 a night, available from the phone number above or www.visionfestival.org (Ratliff).</p>
        <p>JOHN ZORN'S COBRA, Tonic, 107 Norfolk Street, near Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212) 358-7501. Mr. Zorn's greatest game piece, originally conceived in the 1970's and organized with index cards and hand signals, depends entirely on who's playing it, and those musicians' senses of humor, physical reflexes and notions about what improvisation is. Tonight at 8 and 10; admission is $12 per set (Ratliff).</p>
