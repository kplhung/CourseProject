        <p>Ten years from now, astronomers will have seen the first glimmerings of light as stars and galaxies coalesced in the gloom of the early universe, observed how the powerful gravity of a black hole warped the very fabric of space, and, perhaps, searched for signs of life in the glow of blue planets like Earth as they circled nearby stars.</p>
        <p>That sweeping, and expensive, vision for astronomical discovery over the next decade is described by an influential panel of scientists in ''Astronomy and Astrophysics in the New Millennium,'' a report released yesterday by the National Academy of Sciences. Often referred to as the decadal survey, the report is one of a series issued every 10 years by astronomers, giving their priorities and hopes for new observing instruments.</p>
        <p>In the past, the survey has wielded great influence on the roster of instruments that were built. The co-chairmen of the committee that wrote the new report are Joseph H. Taylor Jr., a Princeton University astrophysicist and Nobel laureate, and Christopher F. McKee, an astrophysicist at the University of California at Berkeley.</p>
        <p>At the top of this year's list is an audacious successor to the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope that would be 100 to 600 times as sensitive, two to three times as large and able to look far more deeply into the low-energy infrared radiation, that arrives from the young, star-forming universe. Close behind are a giant, ground-based telescope with an eye 100 feet across and a fleet of four large spaceborne telescopes working in concert to discover Earth-like planets.</p>
        <p>With a minimum cost of $4.7 billion for instruments that would require a wide range of new technologies, the recommendations are nothing if not daring for fields as abstract as astronomy, astrophysics and cosmology.</p>
        <p>Assuming that most of those instruments are built, ''we are in a position to ask, 'How did the universe begin? How did it evolve from a soup of elementary particles into the structures that we see today? Is there life elsewhere in the universe?' '' said Dr. Michael Turner, chairman of the astronomy and astrophysics department at the University of Chicago and a member of the committee that wrote that report.</p>
        <p>Dr. Anneila Sargent, another committee member, who is a professor of astronomy at the California Institute of Technology and director of the Owens Valley Radio Observatory, said the impact of many of the discoveries envisioned in the report would be great enough to be felt beyond the narrow community of scientists.</p>
        <p>''Everybody, across the spectrum, would agree that if we could find a planet that could support life like on Earth, we would be stunned,'' Dr. Sargent said. ''It would be the kind of thing that would change our philosophy of the world.''</p>
        <p>Writers of the report also had their eye on the cost.</p>
        <p>''I think we've done the best job we can at setting a number that we can live with,'' Dr. Taylor said.</p>
        <p>A Congressional staff member who is knowledgeable about science issues said that because the panel members ''do the heavy lifting of actually trying to prioritize,'' the report has had much influence in garnering support for programs in the past.</p>
        <p>The survey has also traditionally been well received at crucial agencies like NASA and the National Science Foundation, a fact that should help improve the prospects of the panel's big winner, the Next Generation Space Telescope, or N.G.S.T.</p>
        <p>''The first thing it says to me is their top priority is my top priority, which is N.G.S.T.,'' said Dr. Anne Kinney, program director for the Astronomical Search for Origins at the Office of Space Science at NASA. ''It really helps to hear that that is the No. 1 priority of this extremely distinguished group of astronomers.''</p>
        <p>The telescope, which Dr. Kinney said could be launched by the end of the decade, would cost roughly a billion dollars and involve gossamer-like materials that would fold up on launching and be unfurled to create a mirror perhaps 20 feet across once the instrument was in space.</p>
        <p>The needed technology for this feat is still in development. The NASA-Goddard Space Flight Center is developing one design, while two contractors, TRW and Lockheed Martin, are working on two others. The Hubble carries a much more conventional mirror, which is about seven feet across.</p>
        <p>Detectors on the telescope would also be sensitive to radiation that is much farther into the infrared, or long-wavelength, part of the spectrum than Hubble can see. Because the universe is expanding, light from more and more distant objects gets stretched farther and farther into this regime.</p>
        <p>The new telescope's keener infrared eyes would let it see objects shining just a few hundred million years after the universe was born, compared with one billion or two billion years for the Hubble. The earlier time is thought to mark the end of the ''dark ages,'' before the light from stars began penetrating the universal murk.</p>
        <p>Both the search for small planets and the probe of radiation emitted in the warped space around black holes would involve several satellites flying in formation and working in tandem. The huge telescope on the ground would call upon yet another type of futuristic technology, involving mirrors built of moveable segments rather than in one continuous piece.</p>
        <p>Other suggested projects would look for waves in the fabric of space, gravity waves, that arrive at Earth from collisions of black holes and other processes, and radio emissions from objects deep in space.</p>
        <p>For Dr. Geoff Marcy, an astronomer at the University of California who discovered by indirect evidence a number of the 40 planets much larger than Earth that are now known to orbit other stars, the search for life elsewhere in the universe carries the greatest excitement.</p>
        <p>''What we would love to know is whether a blue dot orbiting a yellow star has the building blocks of life,'' Dr. Marcy said.</p>
        <p>The space-based instrument the panel recommended to make that search, he said, ''is the most glorious telescope that has ever been conceived by humanity.''</p>
