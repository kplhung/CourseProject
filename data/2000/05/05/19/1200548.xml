        <p>''It was really terribly important after the war when all the young men needed contacting,'' Sir Arthur Conan Doyle says rather breezily on camera during a 10-minute address he delivers on a DVD recently released by Focusfilm, a distributor in Ossining, N.Y. It was 1926, and by his remarks and manner the writer clearly wants to be done with his celebrated creation, the detective Sherlock Holmes, and move on to matters that he considers more serious: psychic experiences and communication with the beyond.</p>
        <p>The young men he refers to were killed during World War I. Holmes, he seems to imply, would be better off laid to rest himself if only the public would permit it. One gets the impression that Conan Doyle agreed to speak about his detective only if he could then devote most of his talk to spiritual matters. People are convinced Holmes is alive, he says incredulously. Women propose to him. As if to calm alarmists, he adds that of course he will go on writing about Holmes and his ''rather stupid friend Watson.''</p>

        <p>''It was really terribly important after the war when all the young men needed contacting,'' Sir Arthur Conan Doyle says rather breezily on camera during a 10-minute address he delivers on a DVD recently released by Focusfilm, a distributor in Ossining, N.Y. It was 1926, and by his remarks and manner the writer clearly wants to be done with his celebrated creation, the detective Sherlock Holmes, and move on to matters that he considers more serious: psychic experiences and communication with the beyond.</p>
        <p>The young men he refers to were killed during World War I. Holmes, he seems to imply, would be better off laid to rest himself if only the public would permit it. One gets the impression that Conan Doyle agreed to speak about his detective only if he could then devote most of his talk to spiritual matters. People are convinced Holmes is alive, he says incredulously. Women propose to him. As if to calm alarmists, he adds that of course he will go on writing about Holmes and his ''rather stupid friend Watson.''</p>
        <p>On the same disc, part of a set of four, is ''Terror by Night,'' a Holmes adventure filmed by Universal during the 40's with Basil Rathbone as the detective and Nigel Bruce as Watson. At 54 minutes, it is the shortest of a dozen of Rathbone's Holmes films and takes place entirely on a train as the detective reveals everything about the theft of the fabled Star of Rhodesia diamond, including the fact that it really wasn't stolen at all but remained in Holmes's pocket throughout the investigation.</p>
        <p>The detective brings off other nice surprises in three other cases on the discs: ''Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon'' (1942), ''The Woman in Green'' (1945) and ''Dressed to Kill'' (1946), which was Rathbone's last Holmes film. By then he had played the role more than 200 times, not only on screen but on the radio in ''The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes.'' In those days, stars walked over to the sound stage after they were finished on the set. Nearly four hours of these broadcasts are on each disc, with dozens of cases involving the likes of the unfortunate tobacconist, demon barber, headless monk and guileless gypsy.</p>
        <p>Though aloof and inscrutable, Rathbone's Holmes is warmer and less severe than Jermey Brett's in the British television series. Gentle fun is made of Watson, a bumbler with old-school chums called Stinky and the Major. Women are ravishing and dangerous in the way they often were in 40's films, especially Patricia Morison in ''Dressed to Kill.''</p>
        <p>Rathbone naturally took to disguises, which are as plentiful as trunks and caskets with false bottoms. In ''The Woman in Green,'' Professor Moriarty, Holmes's arch- enemy, reappears, played by Henry Daniell, whom Rathbone called the most effective of the Moriartys.</p>
        <p>The movies come from the National Film Museum, a large archive in Bangor, Me., that provides old film to producers and distributors. As with many DVD's, the picture quality is only as good as the original materials. ''They'd gone the gamut into television release and other things,'' said Al Taylor, the company's president. ''There were only old library prints so we had to do a lot.'' It was enough.</p>
