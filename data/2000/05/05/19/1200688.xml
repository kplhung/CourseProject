        <p>The Devils are trailing the Philadelphia Flyers in the Eastern Conference finals because Brian Boucher, Philadelphia's rookie goalie, is outplaying Martin Brodeur, the veteran star of the Devils. Boucher is doing it with what appears to be an injured right hand, the one he uses to grip his stick. Brodeur seems fine physically, but his psyche may be shaken.</p>
        <p>''The worst game I've played so far in the playoffs,'' Brodeur said tonight after the Flyers defeated the Devils, 4-2, at Continental Arena to take a two-games-to-one lead in the four-of-seven-game series. When asked why he played that way, Brodeur said: ''I don't know. It was a big game and I was not a factor. And that's not good enough for me.''</p>
        <p>Brodeur made many mistakes in the first two games of this series, a victory for each team in Philadelphia. But he was worse tonight. Brodeur is allowing soft goals on first shots. When he stops first shots, he is permitting dangerous rebounds.</p>
        <p>When he plays the puck away from his net and clears it up the ice -- usually one of his strengths -- he is too often having his passes intercepted by the opposition. On one of those plays tonight, during a Flyers power play, Brodeur was lucky to escape a penalty when he cut John LeClair and broke his nose on the follow-through with his big paddle. The rules allow for accidental stick-to-skin contact on a follow-through.</p>
        <p>''You don't want to see injuries like that,'' Brodeur said. ''It's part of the game.''</p>
        <p>Brodeur's lack of poise was obvious in the first minute when he juggled a shot by Valery Zelepukin, allowing it to land behind him. Although the puck did not cross his line, three others did before the game was half over. The worst of them was Rick Tocchet's soft slap shot from the right-wing circle that went between Brodeur's skates to give the Flyers a 3-1 lead at 7 minutes 15 seconds of the second period. The Flyers finished the game with only 21 shots on goal.</p>
        <p>''It's tough when they don't get many shots and most of them go in,'' Brodeur said. ''It breaks the rhythm of the guys. Confidence-wise, it's tough.''</p>
        <p>At the other end of the rink, Boucher was both good and lucky, a formidable combination, in facing 29 Devils shots. He provided a spectacular moment early in the second period, when Patrik Elias of the Devils broke in while killing a penalty with the Flyers ahead by 2-1. In a move from the repertory of Dominik Hasek, Boucher flopped backward while the shooter made his move.</p>
        <p>Sprawling, looking the other way and losing his helmet in the process, Boucher threw out his left arm and stopped the puck with the back of his glove. The save was a thing of beauty. Fans are going to see it on tape in highlight reels for the rest of spring, at least. The Devils are going to see it in their nightmares.</p>
        <p>''You do anything you can; I was lucky there,'' said Boucher, a 23-year-old native of Rhode Island who won the first-string job from John Vanbiesbrouck during the season. ''He went around my poke-check and I just tried to get my stick on it. I didn't even feel it hit me. I didn't even know if he got the shot off.''</p>
        <p>When people compared the move to those of Hasek, the Buffalo goalie from the Czech Republic known as the Dominator, Boucher replied,  ''People are going to say that, but it was just desperation.'' But Boucher made a similar move on Sunday in Game 1, stopping New Jersey's John Madden on a similar breakaway.</p>
        <p>Tocchet, who scored again for Philadelphia and assisted on a goal by Keith Jones, said of Boucher's save: ''I don't know if it swings the series. It definitely swings the game.''</p>
        <p>Craig Ramsay, the Flyers' coach, was asked whether the save was a defining moment for the series.</p>
        <p>''I don't know that that is necessarily so,'' he said. ''It was a wonderful play. It was a huge play for us, by a courageous young man.''</p>
        <p>Ramsay's counterpart, Larry Robinson, said of Brodeur: ''I don't think that will go down as one of his better ones. But he's keeping us in most games.''</p>
        <p>Of Boucher, Robinson said: ''The other kid played pretty well.''</p>
        <p>As the game wore on, Boucher used television timeouts to skate to the team bench, where trainers taped his right hand and sprayed the thumb area. When asked about the condition of the hand, Boucher replied: ''It's fine. It's always something. I won't talk about it.''</p>
        <p>Someone asked Boucher about Brodeur, the 28-year-old Quebec native who is in his ninth season in New Jersey. ''I can't get consumed with what Marty's doing out there,'' Boucher said. ''When it comes down to my end, that's when I have to do my thing.''</p>
