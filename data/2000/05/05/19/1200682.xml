        <p>Allen Iverson was late for today's practice, but once the game begins, he is often a step ahead of everyone else.</p>
        <p>Led by Iverson, their enigmatic and electrifying guard, the Philadelphia 76ers are trying to write a playoff run to remember. No National Basketball Association team has recovered from a 3-0 deficit to win a four-of-seven-game series. But the Sixers, who lost the first three games of their series against the Indiana Pacers, have reduced that margin to 3-2 heading into Friday night's Game 6 in Philadelphia. If the Sixers win Friday in the energized First Union Center, the decisive Game 7 will be Sunday in Indianapolis.</p>
        <p>At this point, facing elimination no longer alarms the Sixers. They have somehow turned the pressure into a positive.</p>
        <p>''For us, this is the third time we'll be playing a game we have to win,'' said Toni Kukoc, a Sixers backup forward who has championship experience from his days with the Chicago Bulls. ''You don't think about that anymore. You just play.''</p>
        <p>Few play the game with more zest than Iverson, who has averaged 28.2 points a game in the series to lead all scorers.</p>
        <p>Despite being 6 feet 1 inch, Iverson can dominate a game, either by making long-range jumpers or by driving to the basket with an array of moves and alarming quickness. His talent and his toughness have made Iverson a special player, an All-Star who has become the cornerstone of a franchise on the rise.</p>
        <p>But Iverson's penchant for lateness to practice, and several disagreements during the season with Coach Larry Brown, have also been part of the package.</p>
        <p>Iverson joined his teammates on the floor today as practice was about to begin, but he was nowhere in sight during the half-hour media session that preceded the workout.</p>
        <p>Pat Croce, the Sixers' president, said Iverson would be fined for his tardiness, but around the Sixers, Iverson's being late was almost business as usual.</p>
        <p>''He'll be fined and I'll talk to him,'' said Croce, wearing the wry smile of someone who knew that neither a talk nor a fine would probably change the situation. ''I've talked to him before about leadership, about the importance of timeliness. But believe me, his teammates won't show any angst about it. They know him. They know when he gets out on the floor during a game, he gives everything he has.''</p>
        <p>The Sixers squeaked out a 2-point victory in Game 4, then dominated Game 5. But Game 6 will mark the return of Reggie Miller, Indiana's All-Star guard, who served a one-game suspension in Game 5 for throwing a punch at Philadelphia center Matt Geiger.</p>
        <p>Geiger, who was suspended two games for his flagrant foul against Miller, will also miss Friday's action.</p>
        <p>Miller has been magnificent in the playoffs, averaging 25 points over all and 26 points against Philadelphia. After sitting out a game, expect Miller to be even more eager to end this series.</p>
        <p>The Sixers were aware of Miller's penchant for rising to the occasion.</p>
        <p>''Reggie can be quiet for three quarters, then hit three 3-pointers in a row,'' said Aaron McKie, a Philadelphia guard and one of the players who will guard Miller. ''He's going to come out and try to kill us. He's a showboat. He'll play to the crowd, whatever. It's all fun to him.''</p>
        <p>But the series was more fun for the Pacers when they were making more outside shots. In the first three games, Indiana was 28 for 62 from 3-point range, but in the last two games, Indiana made just 10 of 41 3-pointers.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Jalen Rose, Indiana's second-leading scorer, has become ineffective at an inopportune time.</p>
        <p>After averaging 35 points in the first two games of the series, Rose scored just 12 points in Game 3, 16 points in Game 4 and 13 points in Game 5.</p>
        <p>If the Pacers make their outside shots Friday night and spread Philadelphia's defense, Indiana has an excellent chance to prevail and go on to face the winner of the Heat-Knicks series. But the Sixers are the better rebounding team, and they have momentum. So if the Pacers don't shoot well, Philadelphia could move closer to a historic comeback.</p>
        <p>''We've shown our maturity by fighting back,'' said Theo Ratliff, Philadelphia's leading shot-blocker, who has also averaged 15 points a game in the series. ''We're looking forward to another game. We know we have a chance to do something that no team has ever done.''</p>
