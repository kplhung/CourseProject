        <p>Chelsea</p>
        <p>Through tomorrow</p>
        <p>This is not a good work by Gillian Wearing, but it deserves a look before the show closes. About 20 minutes long, divided into three not quite contiguous projections, ''Drunk'' features the drifters who hang around Ms. Wearing's London studio. On screen they stumble, mumble, scream, threaten, fight, hug, collapse and doze. The use of a clean white backdrop, the kind fashion model photographers use, makes the obvious link to Richard Avedon or Irving Penn. An abstract quality in the use of white space was no doubt also on Ms. Wearing's mind.</p>

An abstract quality in the use of white space was no doubt also on Ms. Wearing's mind.</p>
        <p>The immediate effect is stagy, but over time boredom, tension and affection -- among the drifters, and in Ms. Wearing's reaction to them -- complicate matters emotionally, ultimately eliciting compassion. Of the current young British stars, Ms. Wearing maintains at least a sense of the vulnerability and dignity of her depressing and exploited subjects, which redeems them to us and will be her salvation if not theirs.</p>
