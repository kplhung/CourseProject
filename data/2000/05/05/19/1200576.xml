        <p>Dresdner Bank A.G., which abandoned a huge merger with Deutsche Bank last month, is expected to announce plans on Friday for reducing its work force by 5,000 people -- about 10 percent of the total.</p>
        <p>The move comes as Dresdner, Germany's third-largest bank, is struggling to regain its balance after the collapse of the merger.</p>
        <p>Like most other big banks in Germany, Dresdner is under tremendous pressure to reduce costs in its retail banking business. Before calling off their merger, Dresdner and Deutsche had planned to eliminate a combined 16,000 jobs, with about 5,900 of them in retail banking.</p>
        <p>Dresdner executives knew they would have to consolidate operations whether or not they merged with another bank. But the severity of the anticipated job cuts, first reported today by Dow Jones Newswires, is far more than banking industry analysts had foreseen.</p>
        <p>The cutbacks would also be the first concrete move by Dresdner's new chairman, Bernd Fahrholz, who took over on May 1 after Bernhard Walter resigned the top job.</p>
        <p>As he presides over Dresdner's annual shareholder meeting on Friday, Mr. Fahrholz will also be making his first extended appearance in public and providing his first clues to his strategy for putting the failed merger behind.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walter, who had negotiated the proposed merger with Deutsche Bank, announced plans to quit the day after he called off the merger talks in early April. Deutsche, which would have clearly dominated the new institution, had insisted on gutting most of Dresdner's investment banking subsidiary.</p>
        <p>Since the merger collapsed, Dresdner's stock has declined about 7 percent and closed today at 45.31 euros ($40.54), down 0.2 percent.</p>
        <p>Dresdner has been fighting to halt a defection of investment bankers who were rattled by the near-shutdown of their business.</p>
        <p>But analysts say the bank must also reduce costs and find a way out of its problems in retail banking. The problem is that unilaterally shutting bank branches almost certainly means losing customers to rivals with branches across the street.</p>
        <p>Merging businesses with overlapping branch networks would have made it possible to close offices without losing customers.</p>
        <p>Deutsche Bank, Germany's biggest, has come in for scathing criticism for mishandling the negotiations and for the way its top executives fought one another.</p>
        <p>Another institution under pressure is Commerzbank, Germany's fourth-largest bank, which has become a target of almost daily takeover speculation. In the last month, a Dutch investment group called Rebon N.V. has acquired a 17 percent stake in Commerzbank.</p>
        <p>The man behind Rebon's investment is a former executive of Dresdner Bank, Hans Georg Hoffmann, who has indicated that he wants to encourage some kind of merger between Commerzbank and another institution.</p>
