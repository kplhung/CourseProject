        <p>Derek Jeter worked out lightly at Yankee Stadium yesterday and the Yankees then decided to send him to Tampa, Fla., for additional treatment on his strained left abdominal muscle, a strong indication that he will be placed on the 15-day disabled list as early as today.</p>
        <p>The Yankees would have brought the 25-year-old shortstop to Cleveland with them if they felt there was a chance he could play this weekend. Jeter, who was supposed to swing a bat yesterday, did not even do that. His d.l. date would be retroactive to last Friday, meaning that he would be eligible to return on May 27. The Yankees will play the second game of a three-game series against the Red Sox at Yankee Stadium that afternoon.</p>

        <p>If the Yankees rule Jeter disabled, they will recall Alfonso Soriano from Class AAA Columbus and start him at shortstop for the next week. Soriano was scheduled to fly from Columbus to Cleveland this morning. He was batting .273 with three homers and nine runs batted in for Columbus.</p>
