        <p>Reputedly the most expensive animated feature film ever made, ''Dinosaur'' may also boast the longest, most crowded end credits in the history of cinema. After the winsome reptilians and their primate pals, paleontologically doubtful but ever so cute, have wandered off into the Cretaceous sunset, the screen fills with rapidly scrolling double columns of names, identifying the few hundred people who labored to bring those extinct, eternally fascinating beasts back to life.</p>
        <p>The seemingly endless list of software designers, code writers and technicians seems more like a matter for the Justice Department's antitrust division than a roster of movie-making talent, but this vast committee, superintended by the directors Ralph Zondag and Eric Leighton, has used a lot of new-fangled technology to work some gratifyingly old-fashioned magic.</p>
        <p>After learning that ''Dinosaur'' was filmed in a dozen real-world locations, including Hawaii, Venezuela, Australia and the Los Angeles County Arboretum, you may expect a disclaimer vowing that no actual dinosaurs were harmed during production. Marianne Moore once likened poems to ''imaginary gardens with real toads in them.'' Walt Disney Pictures has spared no expense to find real gardens and populate them with meticulously imagined, computer-generated reptiles.</p>
        <p>From an initial close-up of ridged, rippling hide -- evocative of a breathing, flexing piece of exquisitely textured high-end luggage -- ''Dinosaur'' begins, in time- and market-tested Disney fashion, with a breathtaking sequence, a visual and sonic extravaganza that the rest of the movie never quite lives up to. Those scores of animators and technical advisers have conjured a teeming pre-human world, and the first minutes of the film present it in swooping, eye-filling panorama.</p>
        <p>The experience is as luxuriant and intoxicating as a theme park ride; more remarkably, it feels like a real movie, as if the flights of giant birds, the stampede of herds and the ruminant movements of leaf-eaters were all being captured by a camera, rather than generated inside a computer.</p>
        <p>This long ersatz tracking shot follows the progress, airborne and underwater, of a purloined Iguanadon egg, which at last alights in a quiet island treetop populated by a clan of friendly lemurs. At this point, the movie itself touches down in familiar territory and pursues a narrative cobbled (by half a dozen credited writers and story-hatchers) from previous Disney films. The egg hatches into an orphan named Aladar, whose fate is the subject of a debate between mommy and daddy lemurs almost identical to the argument between Tarzan's adoptive gorilla parents. Maternalism prevails, the stern paternal heart is melted, and soon Aladar is a frisky adolescent capering with his young lemur friends and emoting in the dulcet tones of D. B. Sweeney.</p>
        <p>The young dinosaur's identity crisis is pre-empted by a giant asteroid, which unleashes a barrage of lethal, spectacular effects, including mushroom cloud, shock wave and firestorm. Don't worry: this is a Disney film, and mass extinction would be far too downbeat, but the lemur's leafy paradise is destroyed, along with a great many lemurs. (Their deaths are carefully implied, rather than shown, to minimize upset among the youngest viewers.) Aladar manages to save his family, which includes the requisite gruff patriarch (Ossie Davis), the wise, nurturing mother (Alfre Woodard) and the wise-cracking juvenile sidekick (Max Casella, who can't hope to match Rosie O'Donnell's rambunctious gorilla or Samuel E. Wright's singing lobster in previous Disney family outings). They soon stumble upon a herd of dinosaurs making their way to the promised land -- that is, the nesting grounds -- where all the diverse, noncarnivorous species will be joined in the circle of life.</p>
        <p>But I'm ahead of the story. Along the way, the trekkers must contend with predatory carnotaurs (only pedantic 6-year-olds will object if you insist on calling them T. rexes) and the consequences of ecological catastrophe as they cross a desert littered with bleached skeletons and picked-over carcasses. Aladar befriends a pair of kind, slow, elderly female dinosaurs: Eema, a folksy Styrachosaur (Della Reese), and Baylene, a sweet, enormous Brachiosaur (Joan Plowright). He develops a crush on a spirited female Iguanadon named Neera (Julianna Margulies) and falls afoul of her brother, Kron (Mr. Wright in a growly turn) and his enforcer, Bruton (Peter Siragusa).</p>
        <p>The rivalry between Kron and Aladar comes down to a disagreement about survival tactics. Kron, a hard-core Darwinian realist, insists that only the strong deserve to survive, and that weaklings and slowpokes like Baylene and Eema should be sacrificed to the greater good. Aladar, perhaps because he was raised by primates, embraces more advanced theories of altruism and evolved cooperation. The dispute is settled in a no-holds-barred saurian alpha male smack-down, the outcome of which is hardly in doubt. In a Disney movie, after all, good always triumphs over evil -- or, in the moral idiom of the target audience, the nice ones beat the mean ones.</p>
        <p>And the mean ones are pretty convincingly mean. Although nobody knows what dinosaurs sounded like -- there is a rough consensus among paleontologists that they didn't sound like D. B. Sweeney or Ms. Margulies -- the soundtrack is full of plausibly reptilian (or proto-avian, since it's now thought that they evolved into birds) roars, bellows and coos. The reason to see this movie is not to listen to the dinosaurs but to watch them move, to marvel at their graceful necks and clumsy limbs and notice how convincingly they emerge into sunlight or get wet.</p>
        <p>The state of the art evolves so rapidly that Aladar may soon look as cheesy as Godzilla to the children already clamoring for toys made in his likeness. Adults who grew up on traditional animation may notice the seams between the computer-generated figures and their real backgrounds and wish that the figures themselves had more warmth and substance. But I'm loath to contradict the opinion of the preschool cinephile and dinosaur enthusiast in whose company I saw the movie. ''What did you think of it?'' I asked him.</p>
        <p>''It was scary and cool and nice,'' he replied.</p>
        <p>What more could you want?</p>
        <p>''Dinosaur'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). Younger children may be upset by the deaths of several important characters and overwhelmed by scenes of prehistoric mayhem and destruction.</p>
