      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Ellen R. Marram, the former head of Tropicana, abruptly resigned yesterday as chief executive of efdex, an Internet start-up she joined nine months ago.</p>
        <p>Neither Ms. Marram, who is considered one of the top consumer marketers in the United States, nor efdex, which aims to build a business-to-business site matching buyers and sellers in the food industry, would comment in detail on why Ms. Marram resigned.</p>
        <p>Ms. Marram said her departure came ''by mutual agreement,'' but  refused in a telephone interview to characterize it as amicable. She said she could not comment further because she and efdex had signed a confidentiality agreement. Efdex, which has not yet named a replacement chief executive, also declined to comment further on Ms. Marram's resignation.</p>
        <p>Ms. Marram, a member of the board of The New York Times Company, said she had begun talking to several companies about potential jobs but did not expect to take another position immediately.</p>
        <p>Ms. Marram joined efdex last August, nine months after she quit Tropicana. Her departure from Tropicana came three months after the Seagram Company sold Tropicana to PepsiCo, scuttling a planned initial public offering of Tropicana. Ms. Marram, who had won acclaim for revitalizing the brand, was the likely chief executive of an independent Tropicana and she did not hide her disappointment in that decision.</p>
