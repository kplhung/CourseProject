        <p>The unemployment rate in New York City fell sharply in April to the lowest level in almost a dozen years, according to data released yesterday by the State Department of Labor.</p>
        <p>In the five boroughs, the jobless rate dropped to 5.5 percent, down from 6.4 percent a year ago.

        <p>The unemployment rate in New York City fell sharply in April to the lowest level in almost a dozen years, according to data released yesterday by the State Department of Labor.</p>
        <p>In the five boroughs, the jobless rate dropped to 5.5 percent, down from 6.4 percent a year ago. Though the unemployment rate in the city is now lower than it has been since December 1988, it remains far higher than the national average of 3.7 percent and the statewide average of 4.4 percent.</p>
        <p>Adjusted for seasonal factors, unemployment in the city fell about three-tenths of a percentage point in April, while the jobless rate in the rest of the state rose by that amount. Nationally, the unemployment rate fell two-tenths of a percentage point.</p>
        <p>Because the unemployment rate is based on a small survey and is extremely volatile, many economists prefer to look at data on job creation. In that regard, the city and its suburbs continue to boom. Employers in the city added more than 16,000 jobs in April, and those on Long Island created more than 15,000.</p>
