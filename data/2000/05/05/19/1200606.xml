        <p>When Marty Liquori became the third high school miler to break four minutes in the 1960's, he remembered calling his coach and saying, ''This is great and all that, but I wonder who will do it next year?''</p>
        <p>To which Fred Dwyer, who coached him at Essex Catholic in Newark, replied, ''No, this is going to be very unusual.''</p>
        <p>How unusual, Dwyer could not have known. Liquori ran 3 minutes 59.8 seconds on June 23, 1967, in Bakersfield, Calif., carried along by the world-record pace of Jim Ryun. In the 33 years since then, not a single schoolboy miler has breached four minutes, a particular lapse that symbolizes the general decline of American distance running.</p>
        <p>The next serious mile challenge will come tomorrow night in Charlotte, N.C., when Alan Webb, a searing junior from South Lakes High in Reston, Va., attempts to accomplish what only Ryun, Liquori and Tim Danielson have done in their pre-college careers -- run four times around a track with a pace below one minute a lap.</p>
        <p>Forty-six years after Roger Bannister became the first runner to go under four minutes, the mile retains a certain magic. It is seldom run anymore, but it remains the last holdout against the metric onslaught, with its familiar measurement of yards and feet and its requirement of enervating resourcefulness. The 1,500 meters at least retains Olympic familiarity as the metric mile, but the distance run frequently in high school is the 1,600. While the 1,600 is closer in length to the mile -- just slightly less -- it is a distance with no emotional resonance.</p>
        <p>''The mile is that combination of speed and endurance for a long enough period of time that, if you happen to blink, you won't miss the race, as you would in a short sprint,'' said Ryun, now a Republican member of the United States House of Representatives from Kansas. ''It's a distance people can identify with. One of the things that has hurt us is, we felt we had to go to the metric system. It confuses people about distance. The 1,600 meters is not a mile. Just what is it?''</p>
        <p>Living in suburban Washington, the 5-foot-8-inch, 140-pound Webb has twice met Ryun, who ran the mile under four minutes five times while in high school in Wichita, Kan. His national schoolboy record of 3:55.3 still stands after 35 years. Last year, Webb broke Ryun's sophomore class record with a time of 4:06.94. Last month at the Penn Relays, the 17-year-old Webb ran a 1,600-meter leg of the sprint medley relay in 3:59.9, which converts to a 4:01.03 mile.</p>
        <p>Ryun advised Webb to stick to his own training program and told him to surround himself with people who will help him facilitate his dream instead of telling him it will be impossible to achieve. He also cautioned that the ability to handle mental pressures will be as challenging as the physical requirements to run under four minutes. Webb's workouts indicate that he is on target. He has recently run 8x800 meters in descending order from 2:14 to 1:55 on 2-3 minutes' rest, and 12x400 meters in 58-59 seconds, with 30-45 seconds' rest between each lap.</p>
        <p>''He said, 'If you think you can do it, don't hesitate,' '' Webb said of Ryun. ''He said when he was younger, some people said, 'You should wait until you're older to really push.' He told me not to hold back. I think I'm ready.''</p>
        <p>Why hasn't a high schooler broken four minutes in three decades? There are many theories: training has evolved from high mileage to long, slow distance. (''Some coaches feel it is child abuse to make guys run 80 miles a week,'' Liquori said.) Compulsory physical education has lapsed, while increased opportunities to compete in other sports such as soccer and lacrosse have siphoned potential distance stars. The awarding of college scholarships to foreign runners has diminished the motivation of American high schoolers.</p>
        <p>''I think in the 60's, there was a different work ethic in which young athletes recognized that you had to invest a certain amount of time to arrive at a destination,'' Ryun said. ''Today, it's more like, 'I want it now.' Instant gratification.''</p>
        <p>Webb appears to have two things in his favor, aside from immense talent. First, his coach, Scott Raczko, is a former runner at American University, and not a football coach who works with track in the spring. He has Webb training between 40 and 55 miles a week and is careful not to over-race him and to allow for sufficient rest and recovery. Second, Webb appears not to be obsessed with four minutes as a barrier. His ambition this season is to run even faster, breaking Ryun's junior national record of 3:59, and achieving the 3:58.14 he would need to qualify for the Olympic trials at 1,500 meters in July.</p>
        <p>''I think what has hurt some of the kids who tried in the 90's was just that, the four-minute mile,'' Raczko said. ''It's a mental thing. If you're driven just to get to four minutes, you're in trouble. Four minutes is not a barrier for Alan. He is shooting for 3:58, so he's confident about 4:00.''</p>
        <p>So confident and determined that he is skipping his high school prom tonight to rest for tomorrow's race.</p>
        <p>''Only 46 years ago, they were saying it was physically impossible for humans to run under four minutes,'' Webb said. ''That's the coolest thing about all this. It's why I get excited. It's the only thing that makes 3:59 anything more than taking five seconds off my best time. It wasn't that long ago that they thought no one could do it.''</p>
