        <p>Cadbury Schweppes, the big British confectioner and beverage company, and the French global foods giant Groupe Danone have held talks about possibly making a combined bid for Nabisco Holdings, executives close to the negotiations said tonight.</p>
        <p>The companies have been feeling each other out, according to one of the executives, but no decision has been made to proceed with a combined takeover proposal.</p>
        <p>Still, the fact that two of Europe's leading food companies are talking to each other about collaborating to acquire Nabisco's food business is the latest example of globalization in the industry.</p>
        <p>It coincides with another big international food takeover attempt, a $19 billion proposal to buy Bestfoods, the maker of Hellman's mayonnaise and Skippy peanut butter, made by Unilever, the British-Dutch consumer products giant.</p>
        <p>Nabisco, the maker of Ritz crackers, Oreos and Grey Poupon mustard, has effectively put itself up for sale by running an auction for control of the company.</p>
        <p>Both Cadbury Schweppes and Danone had made independent bids during the auction's first round for parts of Nabisco, according to the executives.</p>
        <p>Cadbury Schweppes and Danone are considering joining forces because it would allow each company to acquire the parts of Nabisco that strategically fit best.</p>
        <p>Cadbury Schweppes is most interested in Nabisco's confectionary business, including LifeSavers and Breath Savers.</p>
        <p>Danone, the world's largest biscuit company but one that is lacking any major brands in the United States, wants to acquire Nabisco's cookie and cracker business to add to its biscuit portfolio, which includes Lu and Britannia.</p>
        <p>''The power of the sum of the parts could improve their chances,'' said Jaine I. Mehring, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. ''But these deals are hard to pull off.''</p>
        <p>Cadbury Schweppes and Danone would be competing with several other interested suitors including Philip Morris, which owns Kraft, and the financier Carl C. Icahn, who said last week that he would be willing to pay about $22 a share or $6.5 billion for the Nabisco Group, which owns 80.6 percent of Nabisco Holdings. Analysts have said the company could be sold for more than twice that amount.</p>
        <p>The Nabisco Group is the remnant of what was once RJR Nabisco and retains certain liabilities from its tobacco days. The prospect of continuing litigation has depressed its stock price.</p>
        <p>Last March, Steven F. Goldstone, the company's chairman, announced that he was breaking up RJR Nabisco, which was once the object of a fierce takeover battle that symbolized Wall Street's excesses in the 1980's. He sold the R. J. Reynolds' international tobacco division for $8 billion to Japan Tobacco, spun off the domestic tobacco business as R. J. Reynolds Tobacco, and left Nabisco shares in what was renamed the Nabisco Group.</p>
        <p>At the time, Mr. Icahn, who has tried unsuccessfully to buy RJR Nabisco four times, argued that the food business would still be subject to tobacco-lawsuit liability and that it made more sense to spin off the food business and leave the tobacco company as part of the Nabisco Group.</p>
