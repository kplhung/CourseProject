        <p>Roth Horowitz  160A East 70th Street  Manhattan  Through May 26</p>
        <p>This beautiful little show pays tribute not only to the work but also to the marriage, now in its 50th year, of Nancy Spero and Leon Golub. It affirms that they have managed separate but equal careers while sharing convictions about the social responsibility of art, and also common interests, like the reanimation of traditional or archaic imagery with political consciousness.</p>
        <p>On one side are Mr. Golub's drawings of massive wrestlers and athletes from the early 1960's, rendered in rough textures of charcoal or sanguine. They were inspired by the figures on the Great Altar of Zeus from Pergamon, but they seem both loutish and fragile, both armored and encumbered by their musculature. Their extreme gestures suggest that they are fighting or fleeing invisible protagonists.</p>

        <p>Roth Horowitz  160A East 70th Street  Manhattan  Through May 26</p>
        <p>This beautiful little show pays tribute not only to the work but also to the marriage, now in its 50th year, of Nancy Spero and Leon Golub. It affirms that they have managed separate but equal careers while sharing convictions about the social responsibility of art, and also common interests, like the reanimation of traditional or archaic imagery with political consciousness.</p>
        <p>On one side are Mr. Golub's drawings of massive wrestlers and athletes from the early 1960's, rendered in rough textures of charcoal or sanguine. They were inspired by the figures on the Great Altar of Zeus from Pergamon, but they seem both loutish and fragile, both armored and encumbered by their musculature. Their extreme gestures suggest that they are fighting or fleeing invisible protagonists.</p>
        <p>On the opposite wall, in four of Ms. Spero's classic typewriter collages from the mid-1970's, lightness, linearity and language prevail: stenciled female figures that seem alternately medieval or early Greek share the surface with strands and blocks of text. One work repeatedly quotes a definition of promiscuous by Gratian, a medieval theologian, which is stated in exclusively female terms.</p>
        <p>Another, more airy and optimistic, quotes from a Papago female initiation rite -- ''I am on my way running'' -- and features the repeating image of a female dancer or athlete who seems ready to take flight.</p>
        <p>This show suggests that Ms. Spero and Mr. Golub have conducted a lifelong exchange on the nature of power and its different manifestations, whether beneficial, tragic or mindlessly abusive. It is inspiring to eavesdrop on their conversation.</p>
