        <p>BRISTOL-Sylvia. On May 16, 2000 at the age of 82, Sylvia passed away at her home in Hollywood, FL, surrounded by her awestruck family. Sylvia was a circumambient blur of love and wit who injected her soul into all those fortunate enough to have met her. She is survived by her slightly older and identical twin sister Helen, her younger sister Norma, her three children, Diane, William (and wife, Linda) and Mark, her grandson Adam (and wife, Andrea), nieces and nephews, Maris and Shlomee, Rick and Debbie, and Roberta, grand-nephew Leron, grand-niece Shira, guardian angel Sylvette, and countless friends and relatives, all of whom she loved as her own. Sylvia now joins two of her former husbands in a heaven replete with ocean views, cocktail parties, brisket and endless laughs.</p>
