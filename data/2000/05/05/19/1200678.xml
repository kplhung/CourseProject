        <p>There was no body, no eyewitness to an attack or even any evidence of a struggle, yet jurors said it was not difficult for them to convict a mother-and-son pair of grifters of murdering a wealthy Manhattan woman.</p>
        <p>The panel of five men and seven women took 29 hours over four days to reach a verdict, but there was no real dissension over the charges of second-degree murder against the pair, Sante and Kenneth Kimes, jurors said yesterday.</p>
        <p>One juror had momentary qualms about the lack of a body during the deliberations, said Michael Alvarez, a juror. But that juror and the others quickly decided that the Kimeses had killed the woman, Irene Silverman, 82, Mr. Alvarez said.</p>
        <p>Outside the Manhattan courtroom after the verdict was read yesterday, jurors said it should not come as any surprise that the lack of a body did not present much of a stumbling block.</p>
        <p>Before testimony began, Justice Rena K. Uviller of State Supreme Court and prosecutors had carefully dismissed from the panel all prospective jurors who said they could not convict the Kimeses on circumstantial evidence alone.</p>
        <p>''To me it seemed obvious,'' said Mr. Alvarez, an alternate juror who was put on the panel on Monday, the day deliberations began. ''I wasn't sure about the others; I thought it might take longer.''</p>
        <p>The four jurors who gave interviews after the verdict said they agreed with the prosecutors that notebooks made by the Kimeses outlined their scheme to steal Mrs. Silverman's house.</p>
        <p>''I put the pieces together with the notebooks,'' said Robert Hernandez, a juror and Bell Atlantic technician. ''Everything that was said in the case by the prosecutors was backed up by the notebooks.''</p>
        <p>The notebooks contained lists of information to gather on Mrs. Silverman and equipment to buy, like leg irons and a stun gun.</p>
        <p>''There was other evidence, but the notebooks played a great part,'' said Ernestine Bridges, another juror.</p>
        <p>After listening to testimony for more than three months, the jurors had become familiar with the Kimeses. Mr. Alvarez said that when the trial began he was made uneasy by Mrs. Kimes's hard glare at him and his fellow jurors.</p>
        <p>''She was really staring at us,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The jurors who spoke yesterday said they believed that Mrs. Kimes, 65, controlled her 25-year-old son. Jurors said they saw Mrs. Kimes as overprotective and demanding of Kenneth. ''I felt a little sorry for him; he's a young guy and he was doing what his mother told him,'' Mr. Hernandez said.</p>
        <p>One juror, who asked that his name not be used, said Mr. Kimes was in a difficult position. ''When your mother tells you to do something, you do it,'' he said. ''But he's an adult and he is responsible for his actions.''</p>
        <p>Jurors said they were puzzled by the unusual relationship between Mrs. Kimes and her son. Mr. Alvarez said he was surprised by some of the details that emerged in the trial, including testimony that the mother and son shared a bed.</p>
        <p>Jurors said the three-month trial was grueling, requiring them to put their lives on hold, delay honeymoons, take leaves from work and miss family engagements. ''I am truly exhausted,'' Ms. Bridges said.</p>
