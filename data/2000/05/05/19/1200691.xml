        <p>Baumgartner Gallery  418 West 15th Street  Chelsea  Through May 27</p>
        <p>Steve DiBenedetto's gnarly, rhapsodic new paintings could be the work of someone who has spent a lot of time watching disaster movies on a small television screen while in a state of, shall we say, heightened consciousness. Each is a beautiful little cataclysm, an apocalyptic episode of writhing brushwork, jewel-like colors, wheeling forms and exploding light.</p>
        <p>From a distance, there are signs of an old-fashioned Renaissance clarity to these crash-and-burn events, a possibility of crystal-blue skies and hints of minute, far-off landscapes. (Bosch and early Dali easily come to mind). The segmented circular forms -- which resemble Ferris wheels, hot-air balloons and other frivolous structures and are arrayed in festive reds, yellows and greens -- are usually doing the crashing; engulfing them are teeming free-form passages of browns and blacks.</p>

        <p>Steve DiBenedetto's gnarly, rhapsodic new paintings could be the work of someone who has spent a lot of time watching disaster movies on a small television screen while in a state of, shall we say, heightened consciousness. Each is a beautiful little cataclysm, an apocalyptic episode of writhing brushwork, jewel-like colors, wheeling forms and exploding light.</p>
        <p>From a distance, there are signs of an old-fashioned Renaissance clarity to these crash-and-burn events, a possibility of crystal-blue skies and hints of minute, far-off landscapes. (Bosch and early Dali easily come to mind). The segmented circular forms -- which resemble Ferris wheels, hot-air balloons and other frivolous structures and are arrayed in festive reds, yellows and greens -- are usually doing the crashing; engulfing them are teeming free-form passages of browns and blacks.</p>
        <p>Up close, the hints of conflict and turmoil are reduced to a bizarre range of obsessive surface effects that seem to include brushwork, scraping, splattering, rubbing. The fact that the techniques remain so mysterious even on close examination is disconcerting. (It turns out that a lot of the splatters are created by smacking two wet paintings together, a decidedly Richteresque technique.) At the same time, the evidence of so much activity in so little space creates a dizzying sense of miniaturization.</p>
        <p>Mr. DiBenedetto has always been interested in process, but his previous work, with its Day-Glo colors, tended to be Warhol-lite. Here, he commits himself to a more traditional approach that has something in common with the small-and-intense-is-beautiful stance that has served artists like Thomas Nozkowski so well. There are shortcomings to these paintings, notably a formulaic consistency of composition and palette. But they show an artist changing course, taking some ideas while discarding others, and this is exciting.</p>
