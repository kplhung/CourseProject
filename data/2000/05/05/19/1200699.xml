        <p>Louisa Matthiasdottir, whose long and distinguished career ended with her death in February at 83, painted in a representational style steeped in Early Modernist tradition yet distinctively her own.

        <p>Big, panoramic views of green Icelandic pastures, sparsely punctuated by blocky sheep, horses and houses, are the most abstract. They have a dreamy mood, but the broad, flat generalization makes one long for more specificity.</p>

        <p>Salander-O'Reilly  20 East 79th Street  Manhattan  Through May 27</p>
        <p>Louisa Matthiasdottir, whose long and distinguished career ended with her death in February at 83, painted in a representational style steeped in Early Modernist tradition yet distinctively her own. Born in Iceland and trained in Denmark, Matthiasdottir worked in Paris and New York. This small retrospective shows her practicing three different genres, to each of which she gave a slightly different formal and psychological spin.</p>
        <p>Big, panoramic views of green Icelandic pastures, sparsely punctuated by blocky sheep, horses and houses, are the most abstract. They have a dreamy mood, but the broad, flat generalization makes one long for more specificity.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Matthiasdottir achieved a fine balance between abstraction and realism in emphatic easel-size still lifes. Using a wide brush and saturated, high-contrast colors, she crisply defined bottles, cookware and vegetables arranged like landscape elements on tabletops.</p>
        <p>One feels the decisive gesture of the brush and a deft attentiveness to particularities of shape, light and shadow. There is a playful theatricality, too: objects seem animated like characters on a stage. Curiously, Matthiasdottir often included a big kitchen knife among the vegetables, imparting a certain subliminal, possibly Freudian menace.</p>
        <p>The personality one feels in the still lifes is realized as well in large self-portraits. In ''Self-Portrait With Blaze,'' the white-haired artist stands with hands on hips in a multicolored striped sweater and a blue denim skirt, a Husky dog at her feet. She seems determined and formal but funnily eccentric, like a superior high school English teacher whose strictness masks a wry sense of humor.</p>
