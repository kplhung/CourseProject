      <abstract>
        <p>Op-Ed article by Samuel R Berger, national security adviser, and Gene Sperling, Pres Clinton's national economic adviser, says bill to establish permanent normal trade relations with China, if passed, will increase chance of positive change in China; says those within China advocating membership in World Trade Orgn and closer ties with US are same leaders pushing more daring transition from command-and-control to market economy; says they realize that without competition, China will not be able to build modern, successful economy; says opposition is from China's entrenched state-owned manufacturing sector and Communist officials clinging to one-party control over how people work and live; says US must push China in direction of economic and political reform, which cannot be done by freezing status quo</p>

        <p>As Congress takes up the bill that would establish permanent normal trade relations with China, the question before it is not whether China's human rights record is good or whether the deal by itself will cure it. The question is, in addition to the overwhelming economic benefits, will its passage increase the chance of positive change in China?</p>
        <p>We believe it will, not out of faith that increased trade always brings freedom, but because the specific concessions China is making in order to enter the World Trade Organization will move China in the right direction.</p>

        <p>As Congress takes up the bill that would establish permanent normal trade relations with China, the question before it is not whether China's human rights record is good or whether the deal by itself will cure it. The question is, in addition to the overwhelming economic benefits, will its passage increase the chance of positive change in China?</p>
        <p>We believe it will, not out of faith that increased trade always brings freedom, but because the specific concessions China is making in order to enter the World Trade Organization will move China in the right direction.</p>
        <p>The divisions within China are clear. Those advocating W.T.O. membership and closer ties with the United States are the same leaders pushing a more daring transition from a command-and-control to a market economy. They realize that if they open China to global competition, they risk unleashing forces beyond their control -- temporary unemployment, social unrest and demands for freedom. But they have concluded that without competition, China will not be able to build a modern, successful economy.</p>
        <p>The opposition is the entrenched state-owned manufacturing sector and those Communist officials clinging desperately to one-party control over how people work and live. They know that if China slashes protective tariffs to get into the W.T.O., more of its state enterprises will go. The government's ability to control workers and their loyalty will diminish. There will be more internal pressure for political change.</p>
        <p>Last year alone there were more than 120,000 labor disputes across China over demands for openness and accountability. In some places, the  government has cracked down. In others, it has responded by giving people  a greater say, holding local elections and letting workers take grievances to court. That is how real change can begin. How would we be encouraging  it by handing a humiliating defeat to reformers seeking normalized trade and a huge victory to the stalwarts of a state-dominated economy?</p>
        <p>If China enters the W.T.O. and we approve permanent normal trade relations, the resulting greater participation of American telecommunications companies will also make telephones and the Internet more accessible for Chinese citizens. Right now only 12 percent of Chinese have phones; fewer than 1 percent have  Internet access. No matter how hard Chinese officials try to stuff the information genie back into the bottle, an explosion in information technology will lead to an explosion of idea sharing in China. But if we reject permanent trade ties, our information industries will be denied access. How would that help Chinese citizens seeking new ideas and tools for political activism?</p>
        <p>Finally, as Martin Lee, the leader of Hong Kong's Democratic Party has said, participation in the W.T.O. would bolster those in China who understand that the country must embrace the rule of law. Economic activity in China is mostly based on vague and unpublished rules that maximize the arbitrary power of party officials. To join the W.T.O., China must publish key rules, making it easier for citizens to advance on the strength of their  ideas, not their connections.</p>
        <p>Of course, W.T.O. membership does not guarantee China's leaders will choose political reform. But by accelerating economic change, it will force them to confront that choice sooner, and will make the imperative for the right choice stronger. If we reject the trade deal and undercut the reform-minded leaders who have risked their reputations for greater openness, we will increase the likelihood of the wrong choice.</p>
        <p>Certainly, establishing permanent normal trade relations is not by itself a human rights policy toward China. Change will come through a combination of internal pressure and external validation of China's human rights struggle. We have to maintain our leadership in the latter, even as the W.T.O. contributes to the former. That's why we sanctioned China under the International Religious Freedom Act last year, and why last month we sponsored a U.N. Human Rights Commission resolution condemning China's human rights violations.</p>
        <p>Those who oppose the trade deal have little vision of how a no vote would further reform in China other than maintaining our annual vote to threaten to close our market to Chinese goods (at considerable cost to millions of American families). Yet, after 20 years, this ritual has become  just that, a ritual. Even when our relationship was at its lowest point, after the Tiananmen massacre in 1989, this process has affirmed our trading relationship with China. A human rights commission like that proposed by Representatives Sander Levin and Douglas Bereuter could be much more effective.</p>
        <p>We do not know what path China will take. All we can do is make the  decisions most likely to push China in the direction of economic and political reform. It is hard to see how freezing the status quo, empowering hard-liners, slowing the economic transition, and keeping American companies out of China will increase respect for human rights or lead to a more open society.</p>
