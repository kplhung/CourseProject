        <p>The State Department of Corrections yesterday settled a federal discrimination suit by 33 Sunni Muslim officers who claimed they were in danger of being fired because the department banned beards.</p>
        <p>The ban allowed exemptions on religious grounds, but officers had to reapply every year and provide certification from a religious leader, subject to the department's approval. The settlement eliminated the third-party certification, which the officers argued was discriminatory, said their lawyer, Robert Cannan.</p>

        <p>The State Department of Corrections yesterday settled a federal discrimination suit by 33 Sunni Muslim officers who claimed they were in danger of being fired because the department banned beards.</p>

        <p>On Tuesday, the United States Department of Justice sued the City of Newark, seeking damages for Muslim police officers threatened with termination under a similar ban, which was struck down by a federal appeals court.</p>
