        <p>Over the objections of the United States, the World Bank today approved its first loans to Iran in seven years: $232 million for a sewage-treatment project in Tehran and for improvements in health care.</p>
        <p>After the vote by the 24-member executive board of the bank, its chairman, James D. Wolfensohn, said future loans would depend on the progress of reforms in Iran. Mr. Wolfensohn said that the United States had voted against the loans and that Canada and France had abstained. The chairman said several board members who voted for the loans had expressed concern ''that their support of these projects not be construed as support for current events.'' That was a reference to the closed-door trial in Iran of 13 Jewish men on espionage charges.</p>
        <p>The United States also opposed the loans because Iran is on the State Department list of countries suspected of sponsoring terrorism. Washington managed to postpone the vote two times and had hoped to do so again while the trial is going on.</p>
        <p>Jesse Helms, the North Carolina Republican who is chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, issued a statement on Wednesday anticipating the vote and condemning it. ''I believe all Americans should be offended,'' Mr. Helms said. ''Do voting members of the World Bank believe that as a kangaroo court in Iran continues its relentless persecution of 13 Iranian Jews we should continue business as usual?''</p>
        <p>World Bank officials said the loans would better the lives of ordinary Iranians, including women and children in poor families, while furthering the reform efforts of President Mohammad-Reza Khatami. Moderate allies of Mr. Khatami fared well in recent legislative elections.</p>
        <p>The United States has been in a difficult position regarding Iran, on the one hand holding fast to its antiterrorism principles and objecting to the closed trial while trying to improve relations with the Iranian people and their government.</p>
        <p>In recent months, the United States has eased some economic sanctions against Iran. In a major policy speech in March, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright acknowledged that the United States bore some responsibility for the hostility between the countries. As for the Iranian people, she said, ''the United States bears them no ill will.''</p>
