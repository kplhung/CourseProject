      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says attempted coup in New York State Assembly is looking less like effort to change State Legislature's claustrophobic system than plot to replace one autocrat, Speaker Sheldon Silver, with another, Assemblyman Michael Bragman; says if Silver manages to quell revolt, he should take it as dire warning about hunger for democratic reform among legislators</p>

        <p>The attempted coup in the New York State Assembly this week had a healthy feel to it at first, like a blast of oxygen that aroused hope of energy and independence among the Assembly's Democratic majority. Then, within a few hours, the attempt to overthrow Speaker Sheldon Silver began to look less like an effort to change the State Legislature's claustrophobic system than a plot to replace one autocrat with another.</p>
        <p>Michael Bragman, the second-ranking Democrat in the Assembly, announced Wednesday that he would try to oust Mr. Silver in a showdown vote next Monday. By the standards of normal combat, announcing plans to storm the castle five days in advance would seem the height of folly. Since the first word of the revolt, Mr. Silver has unleashed an army of powerful backers to coax or threaten his troops to support him, especially those teetering on the fence. The speaker has also stripped Mr. Bragman of his position as majority leader and demoted two of his close allies. Some old Albany hands were predicting that by Monday Mr. Bragman would be lucky if his office still had state furniture.</p>

        <p>The attempted coup in the New York State Assembly this week had a healthy feel to it at first, like a blast of oxygen that aroused hope of energy and independence among the Assembly's Democratic majority. Then, within a few hours, the attempt to overthrow Speaker Sheldon Silver began to look less like an effort to change the State Legislature's claustrophobic system than a plot to replace one autocrat with another.</p>
        <p>Michael Bragman, the second-ranking Democrat in the Assembly, announced Wednesday that he would try to oust Mr. Silver in a showdown vote next Monday. By the standards of normal combat, announcing plans to storm the castle five days in advance would seem the height of folly. Since the first word of the revolt, Mr. Silver has unleashed an army of powerful backers to coax or threaten his troops to support him, especially those teetering on the fence. The speaker has also stripped Mr. Bragman of his position as majority leader and demoted two of his close allies. Some old Albany hands were predicting that by Monday Mr. Bragman would be lucky if his office still had state furniture.</p>
        <p>The dream of swapping the secretive and lethargic Mr. Silver for a lively consensus builder is understandable. Over the last six years Mr. Silver's methods have encouraged one of the worst traditions in Albany -- the coalescing of legislative power in the hands of three people: the governor, the Senate majority leader and the speaker. Efforts to open budget sessions or simply to spread legislative power have often been either rebuffed or simply ignored by the speaker. Mr. Bragman's strength so far has been that he is promising a ''member-driven house,'' an innovation that is already decades late in coming to Albany's insular and outdated legislative culture.</p>
        <p>The big question is whether Mr. Bragman's promises of openness are sincere or simply a means to grab power. If the latter, the key difference between Mr. Bragman and Mr. Silver could be a devastating loss of clout in Albany for New York City. At present Mr. Silver, whatever his shortcomings, is the city's sole voice in negotiations with the governor and Senate leader. In his six years running the Assembly, Mr. Silver has sometimes pushed for education funding, new transit money and other issues that have aided city residents. On other occasions, however, he has worried so much about re-electing Democrats in upstate districts and the suburbs that he has misserved his urban constituents, agreeing for example to end even the modest tax that commuters pay for their use of facilities in New York City. Mr. Bragman, who lives near Syracuse, generally has a political agenda that is more suburban and conservative than Mr. Silver's, and Mr. Bragman's views on abortion, campaign finance reform and gun control raise troubling questions for traditional Democrats.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Silver manages to quell this revolt, as most Democrats still believe he will, he does not deserve to celebrate a victory and go around the State Capitol methodically punishing the vanquished. Instead the speaker needs to register this uprising as a dire warning that there is trouble in his house and a hunger for democratic reform among legislators who would like to do the work for which they were elected.</p>
