        <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation gravely mishandled its inquiry into Wen Ho Lee, the nuclear scientist suspected of passing secrets to the Chinese government, by failing to dedicate sufficient resources to the task and focusing too narrowly on a single suspect, a secret Justice Department review has concluded.</p>
        <p>In a report to Attorney General Janet Reno earlier this week, officials said, Randy Bellows, a department prosecutor, singled out the F.B.I. for harsh criticism, even as he faulted other aspects of the government's inquiry into contentions of spying at its nuclear labs.</p>
        <p>The findings marked the latest chapter in the increasing friction between Ms. Reno and Louis Freeh, the F.B.I. director. On a separate matter, Congressional investigators were studying a 1996 memo by Mr. Freeh in which he suggested that Ms. Reno had dropped an inquiry into Democratic fund-raising irregularities to protect her job.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the F.B.I. declined to comment on the report, which has not yet been released to Congress. Ms. Reno ordered the review amid widespread public criticism of the government's handling of the Lee affair.</p>
        <p>A government official who was briefed on the Bellows report, the contents of which were first reported today by The Associated Press, said: ''It blames a lot of people. But it's harshest on the F.B.I.''</p>
        <p>The bureau, the official said, was faulted for moving too slowly and failing to devote sufficient resources to the inquiry.</p>
        <p>The report faulted the Justice Department for failing to approve a search warrant sought by the F.B.I. to conduct electronic surveillance on Mr. Lee, a scientist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, the nation's leading nuclear weapons lab.</p>
        <p>But, Mr. Bellows concluded, F.B.I. officials became so distracted by their pursuit of a search warrant that they missed an opportunity to search Mr. Lee's office computer, which would not have required a warrant. An examination of that computer later showed that someone had downloaded highly sensitive nuclear secrets.</p>
        <p>The report also criticized the F.B.I. for focusing so exclusively on Mr. Lee that it may have overlooked other suspects. Investigators did not widen the search beyond Mr. Lee until later last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee, who is 60, was never indicted on espionage charges. He faces 59 felony counts linked to the mishandling of nuclear secrets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lee, who was fired in March 1999, has maintained his innocence. He is now in solitary confinement in New Mexico, awaiting a trial scheduled to start in November.</p>
