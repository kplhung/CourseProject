        <p>''We'll have to wait till yesterday's here,'' goes the Tom Waits song that accompanies the end credits for ''Luminous Motion,'' and Bette Gordon's funny, unnerving new film casts a similar spell of low-key dislocation.

        <p>''We'll have to wait till yesterday's here,'' goes the Tom Waits song that accompanies the end credits for ''Luminous Motion,'' and Bette Gordon's funny, unnerving new film casts a similar spell of low-key dislocation. It begins with the voice of 10-year-old Phillip (Eric Lloyd) reflecting on his earlier life as if it were the distant past. ''Childhood feels like a ghost town,'' he muses. ''It's hard to distinguish what's real from what's something else.''</p>
        <p>This is an accurate premonition of the dreamy odyssey that follows, but it may seem a bit much coming from the mouth of a late-20th-century American boy, even one as precocious and introspective as Phillip. There is a quality of earnest, overripe literariness to the script -- adapted by Robert Roth and Scott Bradfield from a novel by Mr. Bradfield -- that, at least early on, holds the audience at arm's length.</p>
        <p>''We were like a quality of landscape,'' Phillip says, musing on the nomadic life he leads with his mother (Deborah Kara Unger), and while Mr. Lloyd reads the words with the right tone of wistful rue, it's not clear that he knows what they mean. Is that any way to talk about your mother?</p>
        <p>But the voice-over -- a technique, once taboo among serious filmmakers, that has lately become all but ubiquitous -- is a crutch the movie quickly, and wisely, puts aside. We get a better sense of Phillip's melancholy inwardness, his blithe innocence and his inscrutability from studying Mr. Lloyd's chubby, expectant face. And the relationship between mother and son is too charged and too subtle to be conveyed on screen in mere prose. The story -- nuanced, shocking and slippery -- requires more than a literal-minded transcription of the novel, and Ms. Gordon performs the alchemical feat of turning it into visual poetry.</p>
        <p>''Luminous Motion'' tells Phillip's story and his mother's simultaneously, and its emotional pivot is their mutual pain at the discovery that the two stories are not the same. For Phillip, their life on the road, drifting between motels and diners in a red Impala cluttered with old science textbooks and glass figurines, is a state of perfect symbiosis. He is blind to his mother's desperate, reckless sadness as she ricochets through a series of one-night stands, petty thefts and bottles of cheap liquor.</p>
        <p>Ms. Unger, who played the chief Canadian do-gooder in ''The Hurricane,'' holds ''Luminous Motion'' together even as her character's life falls apart. The film's coherence, and its emotional power, depend on her ability to play in effect two roles at once. She has to show us both what Phillip sees and what he refuses to acknowledge: the tender, funny resourceful mother, and the damaged, lonely woman casting about for stability. Ms. Unger accomplishes this with amazing understatement, and without a trace of pity or sentimentality. Her voice is gravelly and slow, and her face seems always on the verge of melting into sleep. Toward the end of the movie, she's barely awake, and her languorous exhaustion takes on a tragic dimension.</p>
        <p>The tragedy is revealed obliquely, through Phillip's playful, quicksilver temperament. Like his mother, though, the boy is not quite what he seems. He appears to suffer from auditory and visual hallucinations, receiving first telephone calls and then surprise visits from his vanished father (Jamey Sheridan). When Phillip and his mother briefly settle down with a kindly carpenter named Pedro (Terry Kinney), the apparitional father, like the ghost in Hamlet, instructs his son to kill the usurper. But then once the real Dad has returned, Pedro's shade appears to goad Phillip toward murderous Oedipal vengeance.</p>
        <p>At least, I think that's what happens. With cunning agility, ''Luminous Motion'' tiptoes along the narrow boundary between fantasy and reality. We're never sure whether what we see is taking place in the physical world or in Phillip's mind. And while the film respects both his emotions and his perceptions, it also leaves open the possibility that he is suffering from a serious mental illness. Is this surrealism or schizophrenia? Either way, the film sustains a delicate counterpoint between childlike wonder and deep, inconsolable melancholy. It's a bit like ''The Sixth Sense,'' but without the melodramatic comfort of the supernatural. Its horror, like its humor, comes from close to home, from the primal bond between mother and son.</p>
