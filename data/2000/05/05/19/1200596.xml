        <p>After 38 years of conducting their state's business under the Confederate battle flag, the two houses of the South Carolina General Assembly voted today to remove it from the Capitol dome and their chambers.

        <p>After 38 years of conducting their state's business under the Confederate battle flag, the two houses of the South Carolina General Assembly voted today to remove it from the Capitol dome and their chambers. At noon on July 1, South Carolina will become the last state to remove the old symbol of secession from its seat of government.</p>
        <p>The Senate vote was 37 to 8; the House vote was closer, 66 to 43.</p>
        <p>''Thank you, Jesus, thank you,''  Senator J. Verne Smith, a white Democrat from Greenville, said on the floor of the Senate, reflecting that body's relief after so many years of fatigue and bitterness over the issue.</p>
        <p>But the bill, which Gov. Jim Hodges, a Democrat, said he would sign as early as next week, will not put an end to the racial division that the flag has caused. To capture the support of the flag's backers, the bill calls for a smaller version of it to be flown atop a 30-foot pole in front of the Capitol,  next to a slightly taller monument to slain Confederate soldiers.</p>
        <p>That setting as well is too prominent for most of the 26 black members of the House, only 4 of whom voted for the measure. The N.A.A.C.P. has said it will not lift its tourism boycott of the state, and may even expand it to discourage filmmaking and organized-labor events in South Carolina.</p>
        <p>Black officials are by no means unanimous in opposition, however.  Six of the seven black senators voted for the bill, and several joined their white colleagues in calling the vote a historic moment for race relations.</p>
        <p>''Now all of South Carolina can be a part of a great day, of a great coming together of our citizens,'' said Senator Robert Ford, a black Democrat from Charleston. ''All of us should be proud, and I think the coming together of the members of the General Assembly should be the coming together of every citizen in South Carolina.''</p>
        <p>The flag has flown on the dome, beneath the American and South Carolina flags, since 1962, when it was raised by the legislature, then all-white, for a Civil War centennial and to send a clear message of defiance to the growing civil rights movement. Over the years, leading blacks, many elected officials and one former governor, David Beasley,  have repeatedly called for its removal as an offensive reminder of the slavery era, while white lawmakers have kept it flying as an emblem of Southern heritage.</p>
        <p>The issue reached a fever pitch in the last year, after the N.A.A.C.P. announced its boycott and the presidential candidates weighed in, with the Democratic contenders calling for the flag's removal and Republicans declining to take a position. The struggle, which has recently overshadowed almost every other policy issue in South Carolina, became so intense because it perfectly embodied a large political gulf between the races there that has persisted since Reconstruction. Blacks have long felt that they are barely tolerated as political equals, and have seen every reference to ''Southern heritage'' as scarcely veiled nostalgia for the days of white supremacy.</p>
        <p>''That flag represents the Confederacy that enslaved, exploited, murdered, raped and killed our people for over 300 years,'' said Representative Joseph H. Neal, a black Baptist minister, in explaining today why he and others would not vote to move the flag to the Capitol grounds.</p>
        <p>White legislators, on the other hand, maintained that the flag was a legitimate expression of reverence for ancestors who died fighting for the South, and said they resented being lumped together with Klansmen and other racists who have embraced the flag for their own purposes. But many made clear as well that they had chafed over the years at the growth of affirmative action and other policies sought by black residents, and considered the flag a last remnant of a vanishing nobility.</p>
        <p>Many formerly hard-line flag supporters voted for the bill, partly because they believed the flag's presence was hurting the state economically, and because they considered the Confederate monument to be an acceptable alternative setting.</p>
        <p>''It was equally hard for both sides to take this step,'' said Senator Glenn F. McConnell, a Charleston lawyer who owns a gallery that sells Confederate memorabilia. ''Both sides had to bleed on this.''</p>
        <p>Last week, a few flag supporters in the House who opposed the plan tried to make the flag's new position even more prominent by raising the height of the flagpole to 30 feet, 10 feet higher than called for in the original compromise, forged in the Senate. This last act of defiance, which the Senate was forced to swallow today for the sake of passage, helped persuade the N.A.A.C.P. to continue its boycott. Kweisi Mfume, the organization's president, said on Tuesday that the move was a ''slap in the face'' to those who wanted to end racial division in the state.</p>
        <p>But Governor Hodges, who had long pushed for any compromise that would move the flag off the dome, predicted today that the boycott would soon fizzle.</p>
        <p>''There may be differences about the final resolution,'' he said in an interview, ''but what people will remember at the end of the day is that the flag came down. Like other states, we're moving the flag to a historical monument, and we will no longer be the only state with the flag on our dome. And I think people will see that as a major step forward for South Carolina.''</p>
        <p>The brunt of national attention on the Confederate issue is now likely to turn to Georgia and Mississippi, both of which incorporate the Southern-cross design of the battle flag in their own state flags. Efforts have begun in both states to change those flags in legislative sessions next year.</p>
