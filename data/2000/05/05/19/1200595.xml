      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says Defense Dept has transformed abysmal military child care system into model for the nation, judging from report by National Women's Law Center; says improvements would not have been possible without huge increase in budget for military child care, from $90 million in 1989 to $339 million in last fiscal year; says federal and state policy makers should make comparable commitment to improve child care in civilian realm</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In a remarkable turnaround over the past 10 years, the Department of Defense has transformed an abysmal military child care system into a model for the nation, judging from a report by the National Women's Law Center, a research and advocacy group. A decade ago, military child care services were plagued with poorly trained staff, extremely high turnover in caregivers, long waiting lists and costs too high for many military families to afford. But child care became a key personnel issue, and in 1989 the Military Child Care Act mandated that improvements be made.</p>
        <p>The military created a network of child care centers, child care in family homes and before- and after-school programs. It nearly tripled the number of child care slots, and established training requirements, safety and health standards and child-to-staff ratios that are rigorously enforced. It also raised wages to $10 an hour for experienced caregivers, significantly higher than civilian scales. And it provided substantial subsidies to ensure that child care is affordable even to low-income families.</p>
