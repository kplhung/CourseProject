        <p>Social Security is slowly going broke, says Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, and the best way to avoid painful benefit cuts or tax increases is to establish private investment accounts through which workers could seek higher returns on their contributions to the retirement system.</p>
        <p>Social Security is slowly going broke, says Vice President Al Gore, and the best way to avoid painful benefit cuts or tax increases is to channel money from the federal budget surplus into the retirement system.</p>
        <p>The differences between the presidential candidates are clear enough. But behind their approaches are complicated policy and political considerations regarding the problem and the possible solutions.</p>
        <p>How the System Works</p>
        <p>Benefits to current retirees are paid out of payroll taxes levied on nearly all workers and their employers. Because the work force at the moment is large relative to the number of people who have retired, those  taxes generate more revenue than is needed to pay benefits, a surplus of about $150 billion this year and $2.3 trillion over the next 10 years.</p>
        <p>The excess revenue goes into a trust fund out of which future benefits can be paid. But the trust fund is not quite what its name implies. Rather than accumulating cash, it contains bonds issued by the federal government to the retirement system, a promise to pay back to Social Security the surplus funds when they are needed.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the Social Security surplus goes to other purposes. For years, the government simply spent it.</p>
        <p>More recently, Congress and the Clinton administration have agreed to use the excess cash only to reduce the $3.5 trillion in national debt held by the public.</p>
        <p>The Looming Problem</p>
        <p>The current surplus in Social Security could turn to a deficit because of a demographic shift. Right now there are more than three workers paying taxes to support each Social Security recipient. By 2030, as the population ages and the baby boom generation retires, the ratio will shrink to 2 to 1.</p>
        <p>Under projections by Social Security's trustees, payroll taxes would no longer cover benefits starting around 2015, forcing the system to begin relying in part on the interest payments from the trillions of dollars worth of bonds in the trust fund. By around 2025, the system would have begun redeeming the bonds out of general tax revenues to cover benefit payments, and by 2037 the trust fund would be exhausted.</p>
        <p>At that point, if no changes were  made, Social Security would be able to pay less than three-quarters of promised benefits.</p>
        <p>The projections could change with the economy. Over the past few years, the date of insolvency has been pushed back to 2037 from 2029 because of economic growth that was stronger than expected.</p>
        <p>Given that the economic assumptions underlying the projections are quite conservative, defenders of the current system say the odds are strong that Social Security will weather the next three or four decades without needing any major surgery. But the leaders of both parties say it is prudent to assume there will be a financial squeeze, and to deal with it as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>Finding a Solution</p>
        <p>President Clinton put an overhaul of Social Security on the table in 1998. But the two parties were unable or unwilling to reach a compromise.</p>
        <p>There are only three basic options: Cut benefits. Increase the revenues coming into the system. Or increase the rate of return on the money coming into the system.</p>
        <p>Some members of both parties have been willing to support benefit cuts as part of a package of changes. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Democrat of New York, has proposed reducing cost-of-living adjustments. Representatives Jim Kolbe, Republican of Arizona, and Charles W. Stenholm, Democrat of Texas,  have proposed legislation that includes an increase in the normal retirement age, which is already rising to 67 from 65, to account for further increases in life expectancy.</p>
        <p>There has been some talk of raising or eliminating the ceiling on earnings subject to payroll taxes (currently $76,200). But most politicians have steered clear of supporting higher taxes or lower benefits.</p>
        <p>Private Accounts</p>
        <p>In supporting private investment accounts, Mr. Bush's approach centers on increasing the return on the money coming into the system.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has not provided a detailed plan. But most privatization proposals call for diverting two percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax into accounts that would be owned and controlled by individuals. A worker earning $50,000 a year would have $1,000 a year going to a private account.</p>
        <p>In return for the chance to invest the money themselves, workers would accept a lower guaranteed benefit from Social Security at retirement. The basic idea is that the guaranteed benefit could be reduced by more than the amount diverted into the personal accounts -- but that the returns generated for each worker by Wall Street would more than make up for the difference.</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign notes that stocks earned an average annual return, after inflation, of 7.2 percent from 1926 to 1997. By contrast, workers born after 1963 can expect on average a return from their Social Security contributions of 1.9 percent, according to Social Security statistics cited by the Bush campaign.</p>
        <p>Private accounts would provide a start on Social Security solvency  over 75 years, the standard normally used in assessing the system's health, Mr. Bush has said. He has acknowledged that other steps, like benefit cuts, would be needed to finish closing the gap, but has not said what steps he would support.</p>
        <p>Case Against the Accounts</p>
        <p>However strong the performance of stocks in the past, there is no assurance that they will do well in the future. And even if they do match their historical performance, there will inevitably be ups and downs along the way.</p>
        <p>People who retire and cash out their holdings in a bull market would do far better than people who have to sell while the market is depressed. And some people would no doubt make smarter investment decisions than others. Should large numbers of people lose money in the market, there would be tremendous political pressure to bail them out.</p>
        <p>Some portion of any investment gain might be eaten up by the administrative costs of maintaining the accounts. And to the degree that payroll taxes are going into private accounts rather than to pay benefits to current retirees, the government would have to put additional money into the system, presumably by using the Social Security surplus. That in turn would reduce the amount of money available for debt reduction.</p>
        <p>A diversion of two percentage points of payroll tax revenue would equal just under $1 trillion over the next decade. By not using that money for debt reduction, the government would add $300 billion to its interest bill in that period. So about $1.3 trillion of the $2.3 trillion Social Security surplus over the next 10 years would be needed to finance a private accounts plan.</p>
        <p>The Gore Approach</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore starts with the premise that the current system should be left more or less intact. His plan is built on the idea that there should be a way to use the current budget surplus to help Social Security down the road. While the basic idea may be simple, the way the government handles its finances makes executing it quite complicated.</p>
        <p>Since the Social Security system cannot keep big cash reserves of its own under the government system, the vice president wants to use all of the Social Security surplus and some of the general revenue surplus to eliminate, in 13 years, the $3.5 trillion in national debt held by the public.</p>
        <p>Eliminating the debt would leave the government better able to borrow, if necessary, later on. By putting downward pressure on interest rates, debt reduction would also stimulate economic growth, creating jobs and producing more payroll tax revenue to help keep Social Security healthy.</p>
        <p>Starting in 2011, Mr. Gore would funnel to Social Security an amount of money equal to the annual interest savings from debt reduction -- $100 billion a year at first, growing to more than $200 billion a year by 2015. Mr. Gore says the infusion would extend Social Security's solvency to 2054 from 2037 without having to cut benefits or otherwise alter the system.</p>
        <p>Case Against the Gore Plan</p>
        <p>While eliminating the debt would have substantial benefits, transferring the interest savings to Social Security would be little more than a paper shuffling exercise and would still leave taxpayers on the hook to pay for the shortfall in funds.</p>
        <p>Since Social Security cannot hold cash, the transfers would be in the form of government bonds that would be redeemed at some point out of general tax revenue. In that sense, Mr. Gore's plan would in essence transform Social Security into a welfare program, Senator Moynihan said. Mr. Gore's plan would do nothing to address the underlying imbalance between how much the system takes in and how much it has promised to pay in benefits.</p>
