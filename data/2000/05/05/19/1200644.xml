        <p>The words echo across the highly suspect political road of good intentions. ''We're not going to run that kind of race,'' insisted Stuart Stevens, one of Gov. George W. Bush's advertising people. ''Tonally, we will run another kind of race.''</p>

        <p>The words echo across the highly suspect political road of good intentions. ''We're not going to run that kind of race,'' insisted Stuart Stevens, one of Gov. George W. Bush's advertising people. ''Tonally, we will run another kind of race.''</p>
        <p>If the Gore campaign does get vicious, the Bush image-makers say, it will not be because the mud was slung first from Austin. ''They're planning on running a mean, nasty, negative race,'' said Mr. Stevens's colleague, Russell Schriefer.</p>
        <p>The view was repeated in the agency's headquarters here as if it were a mantra. ''Gore has always run negative campaigns,'' said Mark McKinnon, the Bush camp's chief ad maker. To which Mr. Stevens added, ''They would take offense if you accused them of running a positive one.''</p>
        <p>Not for nothing do the members of Maverick Media, the organization assembled for the express goal of cultivating Mr. Bush's appeal on radio and television, operate out of a basement warren of offices they call the bunker: the first steady, 30-second barrages of the general election have not even been set off yet, and already the Bush message people are crying foul.</p>
        <p>Tactically, it is reminiscent of the primary campaign, during which the major candidates of both parties were accusing one another of running low-down, dirty commercials, when, for the most part, the spots were fairly tame.</p>
        <p>But the pre-emptive protests may also indicate a certain jitteriness among the half-dozen principal members of the Maverick team, some of whom are working on a national presidential media campaign for the first time. There is an inside-the-bunker air of a group of well-mannered folks who have stumbled into the toughest neighborhood in town.</p>
        <p>In a cutthroat business, Mr. McKinnon is admired for his decency. ''He's known for running very fair campaigns,'' said John Weaver, who was political director for Senator John McCain's primary campaign.</p>
        <p>But when the opposition consists of the likes of Carter Eskew and Robert Shrum, veteran media strategists for Vice President Al Gore who have take-no-prisoners reputations, the question arises: Does Mr. Bush need a team that plays by the Marquess of Queensberry rules, or by Mike Tyson's? Can Maverick avoid the errors made in Bill Bradley's political advertising, which never adequately answered Mr. Gore's incessant criticisms?</p>
        <p>Mr. McKinnon, in fact, acknowledges that he would much rather paint a portrait than have to slash someone else's. ''It's much more powerful and compelling to create a positive vision than it is to tear somebody down,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That sensibility is reflected in many of the spots Mr. McKinnon creates for Mr. Bush, warm and fuzzy images reminiscent of the upbeat advertisements for Ronald Reagan. The McKinnon style is more documentary; the innovation Maverick introduced in the primaries was the ''crash ad,'' filmed, edited and on the air in 24 hours.</p>
        <p>And his spots feature lots of shimmering boilerplate: shots of Mr. Bush wading into smiling crowds, posed in dazzling sunshine with his wife, Laura, or offering his family-sampler takes on heart-tugging issues. ''I believe every child can learn,'' he said in one education spot.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKinnon and company know they cannot run their campaign on happy talk; indeed, alongside the sunny spots, Mr. Bush and his allies ran some of the harshest commercials of the primaries, including attack ads that portrayed Senator McCain as an enemy of the environment and breast cancer research.</p>
        <p>And the question of tone is not their only challenge. Although Mr. Bush is an immensely likable candidate, questions about his grasp of foreign affairs and other issues could be magnified in comparisons with Mr. Gore, and some political observers wonder if Maverick will be able to fill in the gaps.</p>
        <p>''Here's the hard thing,'' said Paul Begala, a former adviser to President Clinton who has known and liked Mr. McKinnon since their days together at the University of Texas. ''Mark's greatest strength is style, and Bush has a style that meshes well with Mark's. In small settings Bush is very charming: the most charming politician to come down the pike since Clinton. Mark does an excellent job of capturing that. But at the end of the day there is no filter that can be put on a camera to add gray matter.''</p>
        <p>The question of depth is clearly one of the candidate's most vexing image problems. The governor's media advisers, though, maintain that such doubts about Mr. Bush exist in a land where political commentators reside, but not the voters.</p>
        <p>As he sat in a windowless conference room ringed with television sets, the affable Mr. McKinnon would not be coaxed into a meditation on any of Mr. Bush's perceived weaknesses. If it seemed a function of a political advertising man's natural inclination to project only the bright side, it also reflected what those who know him say is Mr. McKinnon's genuine belief in Mr. Bush, a deep and abiding affection characteristic of those in the governor's inner circle.</p>
        <p>Former Mayor Bob Lanier of Houston, for whom Mr. McKinnon made commercials in all three of his successful mayoral campaigns, says there can be only one explanation for Mr. McKinnon's signing up: ''If he's supporting George Bush, it's because he thinks George Bush would make a good president.''</p>
        <p>If there are conventional routes to making  commercials for this potential president, Mr. McKinnon did not take them. For one thing, he climbed the wrong ladder: he was  a longtime Democratic media strategist before signing up with Mr. Bush, working on the campaigns of, among others, former Gov. Ann W. Richards of Texas and former Gov. Buddy Roemer of Louisiana.</p>
        <p>In fact, Mr. McKinnon, a Colorado-born musician who in his younger days was invited to Nashville to write songs for Kris Kristofferson, had dropped out of politics entirely by the time he fell into a long conversation with Mr. Bush in a chance encounter at a dinner in Austin in 1997. The year before, Mr. McKinnon confessed in a most public way -- a first-person article for Texas Monthly -- that after 15 years of politics, he was burned out.</p>
        <p>''Maybe I got tired of candidates' asking me what their firmly held convictions should be,'' he wrote. ''Maybe I got tired of accusing opponents of being right-wing extremists who wanted to cut Social Security benefits.''</p>
        <p>At that Austin dinner, though, Mr. McKinnon's head was turned. Mr. Bush seemed to him to evince an honest interest in education, an issue dear to Mr. McKinnon; he was making a documentary about the inspirational founder of a Houston charter school. ''I was amazed, blown away, by how much attention he paid,'' Mr. McKinnon said of the governor, and before long he had signed up to handle media in Mr. Bush's 1998 campaign for re-election as governor.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKinnon did not win friends among Texas Democrats for his defection; he is unfazed. ''What does it say about me, my values?'' he asked. ''I think what attracted me to him is what is going to attract a lot of independents and Democrats. I came to the conclusion that in the end, good politics is about good people.''</p>
        <p>He also has a reputation for not going for the jugular.</p>
        <p>''I can't recall any campaign where I've worked against him where he even got close to crossing the line,'' Mr. Weaver said.</p>
        <p>That is high praise from a McCain aide, considering how aggrieved his boss felt by some of the commercials Mr. Bush ran in South Carolina.</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign had been expecting the most intense media battering to come from the campaign of another primary-election opponent, Steve Forbes, but it was Mr. McCain who surprised Mr. Bush with the harder hitting commercials, including one in New Hampshire in which Mr. McCain said Mr. Bush's tax cuts would mostly benefit the wealthy. Some of Mr. Bush's advisers believe that their failure to answer the commercial was a major factor in their sobering early loss in New Hampshire.</p>
        <p>But by South Carolina they had learned from their mistake. In one of the most effective strategies of the primary season, Mr. Bush was able to turn Mr. McCain's clean-campaign vows against him. In an advertisement shot at a fishing camp in South Carolina, a serious-looking Mr. Bush responded to a McCain commercial in which the senator accused the governor of twisting the truth, ''like Clinton.''</p>
        <p>''Disagree with me, fine,'' Mr. Bush intoned in his advertisement of reply. ''But do not challenge my integrity.''</p>
        <p>It was a subtle and successful lesson in the art of the double-negative commercial: suggest that an opponent was unworthy because he said something mean.</p>
        <p>''Everywhere we ran that ad, the numbers moved,'' said Matthew Dowd, another member of the Maverick team.</p>
        <p>''Mark made the best ad of the primaries when Bush looked into the camera and said, 'He compared me to Clinton,' '' said Mr. Begala, now a commentator on CNBC's ''Equal Time.'' ''It gave Bush carte blanche to turn his guns on McCain.''</p>
        <p>Vast amounts of money will be spent on political commercials at all levels this year -- $600 million, according to the Television Bureau of Advertising -- and a lot of it by the Bush and Gore campaigns.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. McKinnon does not think this election will be decided inside the bunker.</p>
        <p>''I just believe there are so many other facets in the campaign that are so much more important,'' he said. ''The media, the free press, is the wind that fills the sails. The advertising acts as a rudder, to steer a little bit.''</p>
