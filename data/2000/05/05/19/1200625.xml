        <p>Editorial says Interior Sec Bruce Babbitt left no doubt about National Park Service's responsibility for disastrous Los Alamos fire; says having accepted responsibility, Babbitt and other officials have two tasks: improving policy of controlled burns, and arranging compensation for fire's victims</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt left no doubt yesterday about the National Park Service's responsibility for the disastrous Los Alamos fire. A preliminary internal report, he said, found that officials at the Bandelier National Monument had made several critical mistakes. Among other things, they failed to fully evaluate the risks before giving the go-ahead for a ''controlled burn'' that quickly roared out of control, destroying more than 200 houses and apartment buildings and driving 25,000 people from the city. They should also have had more firefighters on hand in case the fire jumped its prescribed boundaries.</p>
        <p>Having accepted responsibility, Mr. Babbitt and other officials have two tasks. One is to see what can be done to improve the policy of controlled burns, a generally successful technique for clearing forests of debris and thus preventing even more devastating fires. One possibility, Mr. Babbitt suggested, is to '''thin out'' the forest in advance by clearing very small trees. The second task is to arrange compensation. President Clinton has already declared Los Alamos a disaster area, but disaster relief is slow and often meager. The victims could sue, but a law called the Federal Tort Claims Act shields the government from liability for a wide range of actions.</p>

        <p>Secretary of the Interior Bruce Babbitt left no doubt yesterday about the National Park Service's responsibility for the disastrous Los Alamos fire. A preliminary internal report, he said, found that officials at the Bandelier National Monument had made several critical mistakes. Among other things, they failed to fully evaluate the risks before giving the go-ahead for a ''controlled burn'' that quickly roared out of control, destroying more than 200 houses and apartment buildings and driving 25,000 people from the city. They should also have had more firefighters on hand in case the fire jumped its prescribed boundaries.</p>
        <p>Having accepted responsibility, Mr. Babbitt and other officials have two tasks. One is to see what can be done to improve the policy of controlled burns, a generally successful technique for clearing forests of debris and thus preventing even more devastating fires. One possibility, Mr. Babbitt suggested, is to '''thin out'' the forest in advance by clearing very small trees. The second task is to arrange compensation. President Clinton has already declared Los Alamos a disaster area, but disaster relief is slow and often meager. The victims could sue, but a law called the Federal Tort Claims Act shields the government from liability for a wide range of actions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Babbitt has already said, however, that ''if we were negligent, we pay.'' That is certainly the right attitude. The question is where to get the money. One possibility is to make the Park Service pay, but the service is already woefully underfinanced. A better idea would be an emergency Congressional appropriation. There is a precedent. In 1976 the Teton Dam, on the upper Snake River in eastern Idaho, broke apart, killing 11 people and destroying 4,000 homes and businesses. Five weeks later, after a preliminary investigation suggested that the Bureau of Reclamation had built the dam on a geologically suspect site, Congress approved a $200 million appropriation to satisfy claims.</p>
        <p>It is not clear yet how much the damage will amount to in Los Alamos. But Congress could set aside some money now, and more later. In any case, a Congressional law seems the fairest and fastest way to make the Los Alamos victims whole.</p>
