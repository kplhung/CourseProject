        <p>In their fourth, final and tamest debate, New Jersey's two Democratic candidates for the United States Senate found themselves defending their positions tonight on campaign spending and taxes, but the biggest issues in the race -- gun control and Social Security -- were explored only briefly.</p>
        <p>The event, which was conducted more like a dual news conference than a head-to-head confrontation, forced both Jim Florio and Jon S. Corzine to field questions from journalists, students and academics with little opportunity to rebut or challenge each other.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, who is likely to spend as much as $30 million of his own fortune by the June 6 primary, was asked why he had not released his personal tax returns and whether he would support campaign spending limits.</p>
        <p>He said he favored the McCain-Feingold proposal for campaign finance reform, which Mr. Florio said was inadequate. As for not disclosing more about his finances, Mr. Corzine, a former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, said he had already revealed more than enough. ''I have gone beyond the letter of the law,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio, whose $2.8 billion tax increase as governor in 1990 led to a Republican takeover of the State Legislature, was asked if he had learned anything in the seven years since he was voted out of office. He said he had gained a broader perspective on policy from his work as a lawyer in private practice, but he offered no regrets for the tax increase.</p>
        <p>He defended it as necessary to pay for more school aid and property tax relief, and said the tax increases were preferable to a growing state debt burden. ''I was not about to be the governor of a deadbeat state,'' Mr. Florio said. ''I'm a firm believer in paying your bills.''</p>
        <p>The debate, sponsored by The Star-Ledger of Newark and the Eagleton Institute of Politics at Rutgers University, employed an unusual format. Reporters questioned the two men for 15 minutes, but there was no opportunity for rebuttal until a segment featuring questions from students and Rutgers professors in the hand-picked audience.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio did break out of those constraints at one point, denouncing Mr. Corzine, a former chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, for posing as a champion of gun control even though he had sat on the firm's management committee at a time when the investment bank worked closely with gun manufacturers.</p>
        <p>''Jon, while I was standing up to the gun lobby, getting the assault-weapon ban passed in New Jersey, was financing the gun industry,'' Mr. Florio said.</p>
        <p>The encounter was broadcast live over News 12, a cable channel carried in 59 percent of New Jersey homes. It was the fourth debate in a week, but Mr. Florio has attacked Mr. Corzine for refusing an invitation to a debate that would be carried over the ABC affiliates in New York and Philadelphia, which would mean a much wider potential audience.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine dodged questions about that refusal, dismissing ''the debate about debates'' as a distraction and saying that broadcast outlets could have carried one of the encounters if they had so desired.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Florio chided him for ''beating me up'' with expensive television advertisements without having ''the guts'' to face him in a wider debate. ''That's not good for democracy,'' Mr. Florio said.</p>
        <p>In an attempt to reveal the ''human side'' of the candidates, the moderator, Laura Jones, a News 12 reporter, asked the candidates a series of lighthearted questions about their favorite politicians and New Jersey vacation spots. Mr. Florio said Senator Tom Harkin and Sea Isle City; Mr. Corzine preferred former Senator Paul Simon and his own backyard in Summit.</p>
        <p>Only when they were finally freed from the rigid format of the program, in their closing statements, did the two candidates revert to the combativeness that has come to characterize the heated campaign in its final few weeks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine blasted Mr. Florio as deceitful for reversing his stand on the investment of government money in the stock market as a way to bolster Social Security, a plan that Mr. Corzine supports but for which he has come under heavy fire in recent months. Mr. Corzine said Mr. Florio could not be trusted because he had performed a similar turnabout in 1990: promising not to raise taxes as a gubernatorial candidate but breaking that promise 58 days into his term.</p>
        <p>''For my opponent the truth sometimes is a political inconvenience,'' Mr. Corzine said. ''He says he has experience money can't buy. The truth is, he's given us an experience we'd rather forget.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio, meanwhile, cast himself as the defender of families, children and the elderly, while charging that Mr. Corzine's business record proved that he could not be trusted to put the public interest ahead of the world of high finance.</p>
        <p>''This is something that comes down to, who is it who is going to be able to stand up to the big monied interests, the big business interests,'' Mr. Florio said, in a raw populist appeal. ''He's not going to be able to do the job because he's been working on their behalf.''</p>
