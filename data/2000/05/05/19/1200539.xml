        <p>The museum that had the audacity to take the measure of the whole universe with its new planetarium has now turned its attention to another daunting subject: the remote and forbidding Gobi Desert of Mongolia.</p>
        <p>In a new exhibition, which opens today and will run through Oct. 29, the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan has recreated some of the stark grandeur of the Gobi in a diorama that includes life-size models of dinosaurs and tiny mammals living there 80 million years ago. There is the sound of the Gobi, too. The whistling of stiff winds sweeping over the scene is so real that you can almost feel the sting of sand in your face.</p>
        <p>The gallery beyond is filled with fossil remains that in recent years have opened scientists' eyes to new interpretations of the lives of these fascinating bygone creatures. Some are the most complete dinosaur fossils ever discovered, and all illustrate newly gained insights into the growth, behavior and variation of dinosaurs. The fossils show some of the most revealing examples yet of preying dinosaurs, nesting dinosaurs and their hatchlings, flightless birds and other evidence of an evolutionary link between dinosaurs and modern birds.</p>
        <p>The exhibition, ''Fighting Dinosaurs: New Discoveries From Mongolia,'' has one of the most evocative fossil finds in the world, one never before seen in North America.</p>
        <p>Digging in the Gobi in 1971, a Mongolian-Polish expedition uncovered the skeletons of two dinosaurs, a Protoceratops and a Velociraptor, that appeared to have died locked in combat. The Velociraptor, a carnivorous predator, had embedded its sharp foot claw into the neck of its prey, the plant-eating Protoceratops. The predator's left hand gripped the prey's head. In defense, the Protoceratops had just bitten the predator's right arm.</p>
        <p>''This is one of five or six of the most famous specimens in dinosaur paleontology,'' said Dr. Mark A. Norell, curator of the exhibition and an authority on dinosaurs. ''It's like a snapshot of an event that happened 80 million years ago.''</p>
        <p>As far as scientists can tell, neither animal won that battle; nature did. Recent geological studies suggest that an avalanche of sand released by a brief but heavy rainfall buried the foes alive. Such a phenomenon of collapsing sand dunes may also help explain the presence of so many well-preserved fossils throughout the Gobi.</p>
        <p>As arresting as the fighting dinosaurs may be, why would the American Museum mount another dinosaur exhibition now? Its recently renovated fourth floor houses one of the world's finest displays of fossils from the entire age of dinosaurs.</p>
        <p>''A lot's happened in the last 7 to 10 years,'' Dr. Norell explained. ''This has been one of the most active decades in dinosaur studies. Our expeditions to the Gobi and work by others have produced many new species and new interpretations. Our picture of dinosaurs is much different now.''</p>
        <p>The exhibition, supported by the Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Endowment Fund, is one of the main attractions in the Festival of Mongolia, a program of Mongolian music, dance, film and sports being held in the city over the next few months. A related exhibition, ''Mongolia Observed: Photographs Present and Past,'' has already opened at the museum and will continue through Sept. 4. Most of the pictures are by Dr. Robert McCracken Peck, a naturalist and photographer, and depict contemporary Mongolian life.</p>
        <p>Mongolia occupies a special place in the museum's history. Expeditions led by Roy Chapman Andrews in the 1920's put the Gobi on the world map of paleontology. During the cold war, Russian and Polish scientists continued fossil hunting there. Finally, after Mongolia's break with the Soviet bloc, paleontologists from the American Museum joined with the Mongolian Academy of Sciences to conduct annual Gobi expeditions, beginning in 1990.</p>
        <p>Nearly all the fossils in the new exhibition were collected by these recent exploring parties and are being displayed for the first time. A few specimens are so new they have yet to be given formal scientific names.</p>
        <p>No place in the Gobi has yielded a greater abundance of fossils from the late period of dinosaurs, between 120 million and 65 million years ago, than a region known as Ukhaa Tolgod. Discovered in 1993, the site has been the focus of fossil hunting ever since.</p>
        <p>When visitors step into the exhibition hall, the first thing they see is the diorama of the Ukhaa Tolgod badlands. Several of the dinosaur models in the scene may come as a surprise. Their bodies are covered in feathers, reflecting newly gained knowledge that some smaller dinosaurs were probably feathered animals.</p>
        <p>Next the exhibition shows off fossils from the Andrews expedition and compares these findings with more recent research. Here are the striking skeletons of two dinosaurs, as yet unnamed relatives of Oviraptors, that were found side by side in 1995. They also appear to have been buried alive under a collapsing sand dune, where their remains were safe from scavengers and undisturbed while they slowly turned to stone.</p>
        <p>''They are really remarkable in their completeness,'' Dr. Norell said. ''And look at their birdlike features -- the wishbone here, the breast bone, the three toes just like birds.''</p>
        <p>After a nine-minute pause to see a film of Gobi explorations, visitors move to the fighting-dinosaurs display. One close look at the interlocked skeletons and the imagination calls the struggle to life. A three-minute computer animation, projected on a large screen and accompanied by sound, recreates the scene based on current theories of dinosaur anatomy, behavior and locomotion.</p>
        <p>Another section of the exhibition includes several examples of dinosaur nests filled with fossilized eggs and in some cases with the delicate skeletons of hatchlings and juveniles. They are arranged to illustrate the stages of dinosaur development and their likely behavior as parents.</p>
        <p>Other displays are also designed to deliver messages: how scientists examine fossils and determine new species, how they uncover evidence of dinosaur-bird kinship, how small but diverse mammals played a role in the ancient Gobi environment and were thus ready to inherit the earth after the dinosaur extinction.</p>
        <p>With few exceptions, Dr. Norell said, ''We have relied on real specimens -- actual fossils just as they emerged from the ground, so the public gets to see the sort of evidence that we paleontologists base our conclusions on.''</p>
        <p>In the last sections visitors see a replica of a dig site where they can get the feel of fossil hunting. Here they can call up computer depictions of the stages of discovery and laboratory analysis of fossils. At other computer stations, one can visit dinosaur Web sites for perhaps more than you would ever want to know about these creatures. These sites include  www.discovery.com/guides/dinos  /dinos.html  www.ucmp.berkeley.edu  and www.tyrrellmuseum.com</p>
        <p>Before leaving, take time to press your fingers on one of the ''touchable specimens.'' Nothing could feel more stony and lifeless. Yet it is out of such material, dead and buried for millions of years, that scientists have been able, in effect, to visualize life on earth as it was long before human beings took the stage.</p>
        <p>And there is so much more where these fossils came from. Paleontologists from the museum, led by Dr. Norell and Dr. Michael J. Novacek, will return to the Gobi in July, seeking new insights into past life and more fossils for future exhibition.</p>
        <p>What to See and When to See It</p>
