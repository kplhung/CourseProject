        <p>Lucas Schoormans  508 West 26th Street  Chelsea  Through May 27</p>
        <p>Bing Wright, a photographer with both traditionalist and conceptualist leanings, has slyly rejuvenated the cliche of the photograph as a window in two series on view here, one from 1989 and one from 1995.</p>
        <p>Each large print from the earlier ''Rain Window'' series exactly frames the actual-size image of a Catskill farmhouse window shot from indoors.</p>

        <p>Lucas Schoormans  508 West 26th Street  Chelsea  Through May 27</p>
        <p>Bing Wright, a photographer with both traditionalist and conceptualist leanings, has slyly rejuvenated the cliche of the photograph as a window in two series on view here, one from 1989 and one from 1995.</p>
        <p>Each large print from the earlier ''Rain Window'' series exactly frames the actual-size image of a Catskill farmhouse window shot from indoors.</p>
        <p>Because the camera was focused on the glass itself and on drops of rain accumulated there, the melancholy outdoor view of damp grass, trees and overcast skies is evocatively blurred. The rain-beaded glass punningly reiterates the surface of the photograph itself, playing on the old flip-flop made familiar by Modernist painting between material flatness and illusory space.</p>
        <p>The pictures may also inspire philosophical reflection on the nature of vision. Our eyes are not transparent either: we literally see through tears.</p>
        <p>In his later ''Wet Glass'' series, Mr. Wright augmented the ambiguities. Each black-and-white print frames a sheet of glass with water beaded or dripping on it. Because nothing is discernible beyond the glass -- only a pale gray vacancy -- it is hard to tell whether the glass is transparent.</p>
        <p>The images almost read as solidly painted fields like the surfaces of Minimalist paintings. Might this tension between transparency and opacity suggest a choice between spiritualist and materialist ways of seeing?</p>
