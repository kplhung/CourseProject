        <p>Here is a selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy opera, classical music and dance events this weekend in the New York metropolitan region.</p>
        <p>Opera</p>
        <p>''MARRIAGE OF FIGARO.'' The homespun but attractive qualities of the Amato Opera's productions and the intimacy of its shoe-box theater offer a useful change of perspective for operagoers used to the big houses uptown. The casts here vary: at the very least, the singers are eager and enthusiastic; sometimes the singing shows great promise. And Anthony Amato, the company's founder, conducts the performances with an evident love of the music. The closing production of the company's season is Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro,'' performed in English. Tomorrow night at 7:30, Sunday at 2:30 p.m. Amato Opera Theater, 319 Bowery, at Second Street, East Village. Tickets: $25; $20 for the elderly and children; (212) 228-8200 (Allan Kozinn).</p>

        <p>Classical</p>
        <p>BARGEMUSIC. There are few better places in the city to hear chamber music than on this barge floating on the East River, with its live, intimate acoustics and its spectacular view of lower Manhattan. Good weather will only enhance the experience, and the performances are often as fine as the setting. Here, in programs of elegant simplicity coordinated by Ronald Thomas, a fine cellist, he and Edward Auer, a pianist, perform Schubert's two piano trios tonight and on Sunday, and Schumann's three piano trios tomorrow. Mark Peskanov is the violinist in the Schubert, Carmit Zori in the Schumann. Tonight and tomorrow night at 7:30, and Sunday at 4 p.m., Bargemusic, Fulton Ferry Landing under the Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn, (718) 624-4061. Tickets: $23; $20 for the elderly; $15 for students (James R. Oestreich).</p>
        <p>HILDEGARD BEHRENS. The German soprano Hildegard Behrens has been an indisputably great artist. Her voice is also indisputably rough and worn these days. She is still capable of compelling work, though one never can tell what to expect. The program of songs by Liszt, Wagner, Brahms, Berg and Strauss that she is presenting tonight with the fine pianist Ken Noda at the Metropolitan Museum of Art may just bring out the best in her. Tonight at 8, Metropolitan Museum of Art. Tickets are $40; (212) 570-3949 (Anthony Tommasini).</p>
        <p>MATTHIAS GOERNE. This magnificently expressive German baritone is in town for two recitals as part of Lincoln Center's Great Performers series. At the first last weekend, Mr. Goerne was in superb form. The program for his second recital is devoted to works by Schumann and Wolf. The pianist is Eric Schneider. Sunday at 2 p.m., Alice Tully Hall. (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $38. (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>OSVALDO GOLIJOV. This Argentine composer, who studied in Israel and now lives in the United States, typically brings together the music of different cultures in his work. At the moment he is working on a setting of the ''St. Mark Passion'' on a commission from the International Bach Academy as part of the commemoration of the 250th anniversary of Bach's death. It is to have its premiere in Stuttgart in September and in Boston in February but Mr. Golijov and an ensemble that includes singers, percussionists, keyboard players and a guitarist are to give a preview of excerpts from the work as part of the Zoom: Composers Close-Up series. Tomorrow night at 9, Merkin Concert Hall, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan. (212) 501-3330. Tickets are offered on a ''pay what you can'' basis; the suggested price is $9 (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>DON HULBERT. Here is a gifted flutist who delights as much in versatility as in virtuosity. When last encountered a couple of years ago, Mr. Hulbert played both Baroque and modern flutes and joined a variety of talented colleagues in a wide range of repertory. Here, in a program called ''Pictorial Music,'' he does the same, ranging from works by Vivaldi and Handel to Martin Hennessy's ''Virus S'Amuse'' and Kirk Nurock's ''(Unlikely) Aspirations,'' with collaborators including Heidi Skok, a soprano; Kenneth Hamrick, a harpsichordist, and Mr. Hennessy, a pianist. Sunday at 2 p.m., St. Peter's Church, Lexington Avenue, at 53rd Street, (212) 316-3321. Tickets: $20; $15 for students and the elderly (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>PAUL JACOBS. Students are naturally exuberant when they finally graduate, but this beats all. The day after his graduation from the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia last weekend, this young organist began a series of the complete Bach organ works, unfolding over 14 consecutive evenings. Here he presents the sixth, seventh and eighth programs, all mingling chorale preludes with more formally based works, like the delightful Toccata, Adagio and Fugue in C (BWV 564), which ends the evening tomorrow. Today, tomorrow and Sunday at 8 p.m., Madison Avenue Presbyterian Church, at 73rd Street, (212) 288-8920, ext. 267. Admission: suggested donation of $10; $8 for students and the elderly (Oestreich).</p>
        <p>LOCRIAN CHAMBER PLAYERS. Something for everyone on this program of music from the last decade of the 20th century. Joan LaBarbara sings her own song and Alvin Curran's. Three trumpeters project John Kreckler's ''OTW.'' Emily Wong George performs Frederic Rzewski's ''A Life,'' and Katie Lansdale gives the premiere of David Macdonald's ''Amen'' for solo violin. Tonight at 8, Christ Chapel, Riverside Church, Riverside Drive at 122nd Street, Morningside Heights, (212) 870-6784. Tickets: $10, $8 for students and the elderly (Paul Griffiths).</p>
        <p>THE MET ORCHESTRA. One of the best ideas James Levine has ever had was to present the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra in a series of orchestra concerts. The Met Orchestra, the title the players prefer when they perform in concert, plays twice this weekend. Tonight at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, the program will offer Bartok's transfixing one-act opera ''Bluebeard's Castle,'' with the mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter and the bass Samuel Ramey, and works by Debussy, Milhaud and Ravel (''Bolero''). On Sunday afternoon at Carnegie Hall ''Bluebeard's Castle'' will be repeated, paired this time with Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra. The concerts will be the last performances by the concertmaster Raymond Gniewek, who is retiring after 43 years. Tonight at 8: The New Jersey Performing Arts Center, Prudential Hall, 1 Center Street, Newark. Tickets are $15 to $64. For more information: (888) 466-5722. Sunday at 3 p.m.: Carnegie Hall.

        <p>NEW YORK CHORAL SOCIETY. The venerable amateur singing group takes over Carnegie Hall to sing Dvorak's lovely choral piece the ''Stabat Mater.'' John Daly Goodwin conducts. The soloists are Eva Urbanova, Jill Grove, Richard Clement and Richard Bernstein. Carnegie Hall, tomorrow night at 8. Tickets: $15 to $60, (212) 247-7800 (Bernard Holland).</p>
        <p>NEW YORK PHILHARMONIC. Michael Daugherty composes orchestral works with a pop culture sensibility, colorful scoring and ear-catching titles. His latest is ''UFO,'' for percussion and orchestra, and for the work's New York premiere, he has the benefit of both Leonard Slatkin, a conductor who knows his work and is devoted to American music, and Evelyn Glennie, a percussionist whose virtuosity and imagination seems to have no limits. Sharing the program with Mr. Daugherty's work is Stravinsky's Symphony of Wind Instruments and the Schumann ''Rhenish'' Symphony. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8. A Young People's Concert, with only Mr. Daugherty's work, will be presented tomorrow at 2 p.m., Avery Fisher Hall, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $18 to $77 for tonight and tomorrow evening; $6 to $21 for the Young People's Concert (Kozinn).</p>
        <p>ORION STRING QUARTET. The Orion String Quartet has played all of the 16 Beethoven quartets since its founding in 1987. But its current series of six concerts at Alice Tully Hall is the first time the quartet has played the cycle complete. Each concert honors a New York City organization that does work with children in the arts. There are two concerts this weekend. Tonight's is in honor of the Brooklyn Children's Museum and offers the early Quartet in A major No. 5 (Op. 18) and the late Quartet in A minor (Op. 132).

Involving songs by Vernon Duke, George Gershwin, Kurt Weill, Stephen Sondheim and others, the production is by Michael Mayer, with music direction by Eric Stern. Tonight at 8:30, John Jay College, 899 10th Avenue, at 59th Street, (212) 721-6500. Tickets: $40, sold out but returns may be available (Griffiths).</p>
        <p>Dance</p>
        <p>AMERICAN BALLET THEATER. Advance word on Kevin McKenzie's new production of ''Swan Lake'' is that it is a beauty. The New York premiere is tonight.

        <p>BEPPIE BLANKERT. This Dutch choreographer's ''Double Track'' pairs dancers with mirrors, and the effect is spectacular.
