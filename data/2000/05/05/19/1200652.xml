        <p>For years, the Paramount Television studio has been left out of the riches of daytime talk television as shows starring Oprah Winfrey and Rosie O'Donnell became wildly popular.</p>
        <p>So, last spring, top Paramount executives jumped at a chance to produce a talk show starring Dr. Laura Schlessinger, the conservative advice-giver whose radio show is the second-highest-rated talk show in the nation. They scheduled it for September and sold it to stations covering 96 percent of the country.</p>
        <p>But now they are facing an increasingly vociferous protest by gay advocacy groups, who are angered by what they say is Dr. Schlessinger's anti-gay message. And the protests are getting results.</p>
        <p>This week, the nation's second-largest advertiser, Procter &amp; Gamble, announced that it was dropping plans to sponsor the TV show and would stop advertising on her radio program because of the controversy generated by the protests.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, United Airlines, a unit of UAL, said it would not run any more advertisements for the radio show in its in-flight magazine. A week ago, the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council issued a condemnation of Dr. Schlessinger's radio commentary and recommended that stations censor any anti-gay remarks by her.</p>
        <p>Gay activists have complained about her descriptions of homosexuality as ''deviant'' and derivative of ''biological error.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Schlessinger, who declined to be interviewed about the protest, has said in articles and broadcast commentaries that her statements are being taken out of context. She has said that while she opposes homosexuality and a ''gay activist agenda,'' she does not oppose gays.</p>
        <p>Paramount executives said they were standing behind the program, which they maintained would carry positive messages about family values and would not promote ''hate, hurt or intolerance.''</p>
        <p>The reactions to the protests reflect the growing political and economic clout of gays.</p>
        <p>It has been far more common for mainstream marketers to listen to groups on the right like the American Family Association, which assert that they represent millions of consumers, than to those representing gays, a smaller segment.</p>
        <p>About the only time that advocates for gays have won a big, visible victory was two decades ago when their protests and boycott led Florida citrus commissioners to end an endorsement contract with the singer Anita Bryant.</p>
        <p>Boycott threats from conservatives have proved mostly powerless -- as when the sales of the Clorox Company a decade ago were unaffected by a boycott called by the family association for sponsoring shows with content it viewed as objectionable.</p>
        <p>But the conservative organizations have achieved results by generating controversy about a TV series or individual episode that dissuaded marketers from buying commercial time in the first place, rather than withdrawing commercials they had already agreed to run.</p>
        <p>That worked for two years to keep most mainstream advertisers off ''N.Y.P.D. Blue'' despite strong ratings in the initial two seasons; only after seeing how that large viewership kept watching the series week after week did large advertisers climb aboard.</p>
        <p>''Controversy is in general something advertisers want to avoid,'' said Howard Buford, president and chief executive at Prime Access in New York, an agency specializing in campaigns directed toward gays. ''The idea of advertising is to pull people in, not drive people away, so when a topic is divisive or polarizing, you want to stay away.''</p>
        <p>The reason advertisers would begin to listen to gays about what upsets them is a result, Mr. Buford said, of ''the fact that there's a very different picture now of who is gay and what it means.''</p>
        <p>Robin Tyler, a gay who co-founded a Web site that has rallied opposition to the Dr. Schlessinger TV show (www.stopdrlaura.com), said one reason the anti-Schlessinger forces were gaining momentum so quickly  was that the Internet was enabling the organizers ''to get out our messages instantly, reaching millions of us in our own communities.''</p>
        <p>Stopdrlaura.com was the brainchild of a small group of activists. But now, established gay and lesbian organizations like the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation are marshaling their forces to join the fight.</p>
        <p>Dr. Schlessinger has said that while gays are ''entitled to love and respect as are all human beings,'' homosexual activity is incompatible with Scripture. She has said she supports the concept of therapy for gays who wish to change their sexual orientation. She supported a ballot proposition in California that outlawed same-sex marriages.</p>
        <p>The decision by Procter &amp; Gamble, which spends more than $2.6 billion a year in advertising for brands like Tide, Pampers and Crest, could lead to defections by other advertisers because the company is a pacesetter among the mass market advertisers that buy most of the commercial time during syndicated talk shows.</p>
        <p>Paramount executives said yesterday that no other sponsors had pulled out. Despite trepidation expressed by some station managers, the executives said no local stations had moved to drop the show.</p>
        <p>The show is said to have offended employees at all levels of Paramount, and some of the studio's executives want it dropped.</p>
        <p>The producer of ''Frasier,'' David Lee, who is openly gay, said yesterday that he had repeatedly asked his studio to call off the show, but to no avail.</p>
