        <p>The French-Canadian troupe Cirque du Soleil is renowned for conjuring visual magic that fuses dance and the circus arts in scenarios that often carry a mythical and spiritual charge. And in the tableaus they have created for the new Imax-3D film ''Journey of Man'' they have compiled an all-engulfing sensuous wonder book of aesthetic adventures with a light moral gloss.</p>
        <p>Watching the Cirque du Soleil's acrobats leap, twirl and dive in spectacular natural settings, you often have the sensation of forsaking the everyday world and plunging into a strange, paradisaical and slightly scary dimension of pure myth, with a Gallic flavor.</p>

        <p>The French-Canadian troupe Cirque du Soleil is renowned for conjuring visual magic that fuses dance and the circus arts in scenarios that often carry a mythical and spiritual charge. And in the tableaus they have created for the new Imax-3D film ''Journey of Man'' they have compiled an all-engulfing sensuous wonder book of aesthetic adventures with a light moral gloss.</p>
        <p>Watching the Cirque du Soleil's acrobats leap, twirl and dive in spectacular natural settings, you often have the sensation of forsaking the everyday world and plunging into a strange, paradisaical and slightly scary dimension of pure myth, with a Gallic flavor.</p>
        <p>An ambitious dual allegory, the movie, which opens today at Sony Theaters Lincoln Square, roughly parallels the ascent of humankind from caves into a civilized stateliness with symbolic portrayals of the human life cycle from early childhood to old age. As beautiful as the movie is, its brief 38-minute length prevents it from having much impact as a sweeping allegory. Almost before the movie begins, it seems to be over.</p>
        <p>That said, the film, directed by Keith Melton, written by Steve Roberts and Peter Wagg, and narrated by Ian McKellen with a high-toned hauteur, works as a series of enthralling tableaus that seem almost to burst out of one another like visionary flashes from an unusually vivid dream.</p>
        <p>The film begins with an illustration of the Big Bang theory of creation, as an explosion of light and a pounded bass drum introduce Cirque du Soleil percussionists painted and costumed as Japanese taiko drummers performing in a court style that dates back to the eighth century. As they play, an embryonic ''universal child'' appears who is plunged at the end of the sequence into the ocean to be ''born'' in an interpretive dance performed underwater by a group synchronized swimmers with amazing breath control.</p>
        <p>Rocketing out of the water, the child lands in an enchanted redwood forest (the movie's most magical sequence) where he meets his ''instinctual guides,'' the Flounes, a pair of clownish parental shamans who watch over him like silent guardian angels. The tableau is dominated by yellow bird-like bungee jumpers who leap from the trees like human yo-yo's. At first they seem scary. But once the child has mustered his courage, they whisk him off into a different world.</p>
        <p>Finding himself in a craggy arid canyon that suggests a spectacular limbo (the sequence was filled in Valley of Fire State Park in the Nevada desert), the child, now adolescent, looks up to observes a muscular daredevil, poised on a pinnacle, deftly manipulating a gleaming metallic cube. Inspired by his courage, the boy eventually makes his way to the top of the canyon as the cube bursts into flame and his elusive idol sails away into the darkness.</p>
        <p>The next stop is an idyllic 17th-century garden in whose reflecting pool two statues floating on a giant lily pad come to life, perform a precarious, slow-motion balancing act that demonstrates an idealized yin-yang harmony (devoid of overt eroticism) between man and woman.</p>
        <p>The movie takes a quasi-biblical turn with the arrival of the evil Stiltman, a mildly satanic figure who tempts the young man with a gold bowler hat symbolizing wealth and  power.</p>
        <p>In the next scene, the man, surrounded by elegant luxury, is entertained by the Banquine, a group of vagabond tumblers who try to revive the spirit of his lost childhood. In the final chapter, the now mature man, his youthful joie de vivre restored, reunites with the Flounes and finds himself at the Brandenberg Gate in Berlin surrounded by children whom he leads toward knowledge.</p>
        <p>''Journey of Man'' may not impart much genuine wisdom. But it conveys plenty of wonder while mostly avoiding any saccharine preachiness. At its most evocative, you really do feel you've stumbled into an enchanted realm.</p>
