        <p>Here is a selective listing of new or noteworthy cabaret shows in Manhattan this weekend. * denotes a highly recommended show.</p>
        <p>KAYE BALLARD, Arci's Place, 450 Park Avenue South, at 30th Street, (212) 532-4370. Now in her 70's, Ms. Ballard is performing in a rare New York cabaret engagement, an indefatigably gregarious one-woman variety show. She sings, tells jokes, does impersonations and even plays the flute (John Denver's ''Annie's Song''). Her latest act, ''Another Final Farewell Appearance,'' is a warmhearted tribute to traditional show business idols, including Henny Youngman, Jimmy Durante, Mabel Mercer and Alice Faye. Her voice may sound frayed, but her singing conveys enormous heart, and her ebullience is contagious. Friday nights at 8:30; Saturdays at 8:30 and 11; Tuesdays through Thursdays at 9. Through June 3. Sunday at 8 p.m., Lisa Asher, singer, with Jeff Waxman, musical director. Monday, Steven Lutvak, singer and songwriter. Cover: $25; $15 minimum.</p>

Sunday at 8 p.m., Lisa Asher, singer, with Jeff Waxman, musical director. Monday, Steven Lutvak, singer and songwriter. Cover: $25; $15 minimum.</p>
        <p>BARBARA CARROLL, Bemelmans Bar, Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600. This agelessly chic red-haired pianist and singer seems to know every important popular song ever written and to be able to perform from memory in any key. Her elegant, lyrical pianism is a compendium of 20th-century jazz styles, from Count Basie to Erroll Garner to Bill Evans and beyond. And her clipped, understated vocals, which verge on speech-song, approach lyrics from a wry but warmhearted point of view. Through July 22. Tuesday through Saturday nights, beginning at 9:30. From 5:30 to 8, Michael Devine. No cover for early show; cover for late show: $15. No minimum; $5 cover at the bar.</p>
        <p>* ''OUR SINATRA,'' Blue Angel Theater, 323 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200. The rising young cabaret star Eric Comstock is the mastermind behind this utterly winning tribute to Ol' Blue Eyes, which focuses on what Mr. Comstock calls the hidden gems and orphan songs that Sinatra made popular. Joined by Christopher Gines, a creamy baritone who echoes Dick Haymes and Steve Lawrence in their prime, and Hilary Kole, a perky swinger, Mr. Comstock conducts a witty and knowledgeable survey of the Sinatra canon. Mr. Comstock focuses on the mature Sinatra and Mr. Gines on the dreamy 1940's balladeer, with Ms. Kole bridging the gap. The memorable show proves there are still young singers good enough to keep the tradition alive. Today, tomorrow, Monday and Thursday nights at 8; Sunday at 3 and 7:30 p.m.; Wednesday at 2:30 and 8 p.m. Tickets: $50 and $55 (premium ringside seating, $75 and $80).</p>
        <p>* STEVE ROSS, the Firebird Cafe, 363 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 586-0244. Although this debonair singer and pianist is best known for playfully inhabiting the spirits of Cole Porter, Noel Coward and Fred Astaire, he also has an introspective side. And in his superb new show, ''Love and Laughter, Part 1,'' witty romps like Porter's ''They Couldn't Compare to You'' are balanced by meditative renditions of ''All Through the Night,'' ''My Shining Hour,'' ''I Can Dream, Can't I?'' and ''One for My Baby (and One More for the Road)'' that find psychological dimensions in familiar ballads. At his most lucid, his dry, self-aware interpretations make him a philosopher of fantasy. Wednesday and Thursday nights at 9; Fridays and Saturdays at 9 and 11. Through June 3. Cover: $30; $15 minimum. Also at the Firebird, Christine Lavin, Sunday night at 7, as part of the songwriters' series. Cover $20; $15 minimum. Sunday nights at 9, James Beaman as Marlene Dietrich. Through May 28. Cover: $30; $15 minimum.</p>
        <p>* BOBBY SHORT, Cafe Carlyle, at the Carlyle Hotel, 35 East 76th Street, Manhattan, (212) 744-1600. Although his voice has its ups and downs, Mr. Short, now 75, still gives the best cabaret party in New York. For his 32nd spring season at the Cafe Carlyle, he is joined by a small, top-notch swing band, and he struts his bluesier pianism in the instrumental ''Moten Swing.'' Nobody puts a more vivacious spin on Cole Porter than Mr. Short, whose new show includes a boyishly wistful version of ''Why Shouldn't I?'' and the hilariously tongue-twisting, double-entendre-laden title song from ''Can-Can.'' Tuesday through Saturday nights at 8:45 and 10:45. Through June 24. Cover: $60 at tables, no minimum; $30 cover at the bar.</p>
        <p>LAURIE BEECHMAN THEATER, West Bank Cafe, 407 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 695-6909. Rusty Magee, comedy and music. Tonight and tomorrow night at 8:30, Cover: $12; one-drink minimum.</p>
