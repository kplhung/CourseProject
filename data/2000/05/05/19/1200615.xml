        <p>The staff of the Justice Department's antitrust division recently recommended that the government block the proposed $115 billion merger of WorldCom Inc. and Sprint, people involved in the matter said today.</p>
        <p>The recommendation was made in a ''fact memorandum'' sent to Joel I. Klein, the assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division, who has scheduled a series of meetings with government lawyers and company executives to decide whether to accept the memorandum's findings. The talks are expected to last through most of the summer and may lead to negotiations over what assets the companies need to shed to satisfy regulators' concerns.</p>
        <p>The findings threaten to unhinge a deal that was questioned by federal officials even before it was officially announced. But company executives say they hoped to convince Mr. Klein and officials at the Federal Communications Commission that the deal should nonetheless be approved.</p>
        <p>They contend that the long-distance telephone market is changing so rapidly that it defies a conventional antitrust analysis that relies heavily on reviewing market share. The companies say they hope to convince Mr. Klein that the telephone market is changing so profoundly, because of the development of the Internet and its ability to be used as a telephone service, that it would be impossible for one phone company to truly dominate.</p>
        <p>But if the memorandum submitted to Mr. Klein is any indication, the companies face an uphill struggle.</p>
        <p>Industry analysts and antitrust experts have said that, absent significant divestitures, they expect both the Justice Department and the F.C.C. to object to the deal, which proposes to merge the nation's second-  and third-largest long-distance telephone services. Sprint executives have said that the company will sell its Internet backbone as part of the deal, although government officials have indicated that will not be enough of a divestiture to satisfy them.</p>
        <p>The deal is also under review by  the European Commission, which last month warned of antitrust problems.</p>
        <p>The fact memorandum critical of the merger was prepared by Stephen M. Axinn, an antitrust litigator from New York who was retained by Mr. Klein to review the deal. People involved in the review said the memorandum concluded that the proposed merger would violate federal antitrust laws. If the deal were approved, it would mean that the merged companies and AT&amp;T, the largest long-distance carrier, would control about 80 percent of the market.</p>
        <p>But executives from WorldCom and Sprint say the Justice Department should not rely solely on an analysis of market share because the industry is changing so rapidly, particularly as the Internet offers new options as a vehicle for telephone service. They also say that one of the clearest signs that the long-distance market is changing so quickly is the decision by AT&amp;T to rely less on its long-distance business and instead transform itself into the nation's largest cable company.</p>
        <p>The news that Mr. Axinn was preparing to oppose the deal was reported on Wednesday by Scott C. Cleland, a telecommunications analyst at the Legg Mason Precursor Group, who has long predicted that the Justice Department would block the deal. After similar views were published today in The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post, the shares of both companies slid, with Sprint dropping $1.75, to $56.25, and WorldCom falling $2.4375 to $39.5625.</p>
        <p>The companies maintain that it is impossible for one company to dominate the telecommunications market.</p>
        <p>''When we signed the merger deal we knew the government would take the traditional long-distance market into account in its consideration of the deal,'' said Peter Lucht, a spokesman for WorldCom. ''We believe that the dramatic changes affecting the telecom industry, including technology, the competitive landscape and consumer demand, will lead the D.O.J. to decide that this merger should be approved.''</p>
        <p>The government's possible objections to the deal arose even before the merger was announced by senior executives. Moments before a news conference by the companies' top executives, William E. Kennard, the chairman of the F.C.C., issued a statement asking ''How can this be good for consumers?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennard, who normally refrains from discussing pending deals and has not blocked a single large telecommunications merger, also said that the companies would ''bear a heavy burden to show how consumers would be better off.''</p>
        <p>The Justice Department also signaled that it was skeptical of the merger when it hired Mr. Axinn rather than rely on its in-house staff, which has approved the vast majority of telecommunications and other mergers before it.</p>
