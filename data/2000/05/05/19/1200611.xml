        <p>As political jockeying on a China trade bill entered an intensive final stretch, both the Clinton administration and its opponents claimed crucial backing today from persecuted democracy leaders in China and in exile.</p>
        <p>The dueling claims are possible because the dissident community is sharply divided over whether China should have permanent trade ties with the United States, a decision many see as the most important test of American policy toward China since 1989, when Beijing ordered a bloody crackdown on democracy protesters.</p>
        <p>While many of the bill's backers say that it appears headed for passage, both sides are continuing to fight for every vote in the House, where scores of lawmakers remain undecided.</p>
        <p>In newspaper opinion pieces and lobbying calls on Capitol Hill, Chinese democracy leaders are expressing opposite views about whether permanent normal trade relations will increase or retard human rights and political freedoms.</p>
        <p>The conflicting messages have largely neutralized the dissidents' impact on the vote, lawmakers said today, and appear to have driven a new wedge between opposition leaders who have long tended to fight among themselves instead of unifying against the Beijing government.</p>
        <p>''The moment Congress says yes to permanent normal trade relations is the moment that China stops listening to what the United States says about human rights,'' said Wei Jingsheng, one of China's best-known dissidents, who spent 18 years in Chinese prison before becoming an exile in this country.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wei, 50 years old, said he moved temporarily to Washington from New York so that he could lobby full-time to defeat permanent trade ties, one of the Clinton administration's top foreign policy priorities.</p>
        <p>Congressional opponents of the trade bill staged a rally on Capitol Hill today in which they introduced several dozen Chinese workers, student leaders and veteran activists who urged Congress to vote down permanent trade ties.</p>
        <p>But President Clinton is also pointing to support from well known opposition leaders in China and abroad.</p>
        <p>He has cited on opinion piece written by Dai Qing, a Beijing-based human rights and environmental activist. He asked Martin Lee, a leading Hong Kong democrat who supports permanent trade ties, to help him lobby Congress. And the White House has distributed copies of a pro-trade message from what it called an underground democracy activist in the Chinese province of Zhejiang.</p>
        <p>Several Tiananmen Square student leaders, including Wang Dang and Chai Ling, have also said that they support granting China permanent trade status.</p>
        <p>''I believe that permanent normal trade status, with its implication of openness and fairness, is among the most powerful means of promoting freedom in China,'' Ms. Dai wrote in an essay published in The Los Angeles Times. Ms. Dai is best known for seeking to stop China's giant Three Gorges Dam construction project and for investigating corruption within the ruling Communist Party.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration today sought to build momentum for the vote after two Congressional committees strongly endorsed the measure Wednesday.</p>
        <p>The White House said President Clinton intends to make a short, prime-time television address on China Sunday night. But of the major national networks, only NBC has agreed to grant air time to the president, while CBS, Fox and ABC declined, network officials said.</p>
        <p>In a highly unusual move, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan joined Mr. Clinton in the White House Rose Garden to lend his support. Though Mr. Greenspan has weighed in on legislation before, especially on fiscal and financial matters, the Fed chairman usually maintains impartiality on White House foreign-policy goals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenspan, who was asked to speak out on China trade by Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers, said he supports the bill on economic grounds. He said the trade bill would have ''profound implications for the free world's trading system and the long-term growth potential of the American economy.''</p>
        <p>On Capitol Hill, some Democratic and Republican lawmakers were still scrambling to secure Republican leadership support for a new Congressional-executive human rights commission to monitor China and advise Congress and the administration.</p>
        <p>Legislation to create the commission is seen as essential to rounding up support for the trade bill among the large number of undecided lawmakers in both parties, many of whom say they are wary of sacrificing their annual review of China's trade status unless they create a new forum to monitor human rights.</p>
        <p>Republican Congressional leaders have already agreed to support one part of the so-called Levin-Bereuter proposal, a provision that would help guard against sudden surges of imports from China.</p>
        <p>But Republican leaders last night were still discussing whether to include language authorizing a human rights commission in the trade bill. Democrats are insisting that the trade and human right measures must be considered together in one package.</p>
        <p>''Many of our colleagues are concerned that if the commission moves only in parallel legislation that it could falter and not become law,'' said Doug Bereuter, Nebraska Republican who co-sponsored the proposal.</p>
        <p>Supporters scheduled a press conference for Friday morning to unveil details of the new legislative package, and Congressional aides said they expected several undecided lawmakers to announce their support for the trade bill at the same time.</p>
        <p>The Capitol Hill rally was intended to refute White House claims that Chinese opposition leaders support elevated trade ties. Participants argued that by ending the annual trade review, Congress would sacrifice the only real leverage it has over China's behavior toward its own citizens.</p>
        <p>''China will never change unless it's under pressure,'' said Wang Xizhe, a gray-haired veteran of the opposition movement who now lives in the United States. Mr. Wang wrote an influential essay criticizing the excesses of the Cultural Revolution in 1974 and had been in and out of prison for nearly 25 years before he fled China three years ago.</p>
        <p>He said that without the annual review of China trade status, Beijing authorities might never have released him from jail.</p>
        <p>''The debate in Congress each year was one of the few things to lift my spirits when I was in jail,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But he acknowledged a deep split in the dissident community and he criticized exiled Tiananmen Square student leaders who support the trade bill as naive. ''Some of us understand the Chinese people and some of us do not,'' he said.</p>
