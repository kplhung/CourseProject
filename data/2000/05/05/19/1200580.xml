        <p>As nervous investors from major Wall Street firms held a conference call on Nassau County's shaky finances, county officials began a new round of bickering today over the numbers in their plans to cut spending.</p>
        <p>The quarrel erupted after County Comptroller Frederick E. Parola, a Republican, criticized a list of cost-cutting measures proposed by the Democrats who control the County Legislature. The Democrats said the items would save the county $50 million; Mr. Parola said their plan fell some $30 million short of its goal.</p>
        <p>The Democrats, clearly angry, sent the county comptroller a new calculator.</p>
        <p>Then, after some consultation with the Democrats, Mr. Parola agreed that their list would actually save $47 million but warned that $27 million of the savings would be in one-shot deals that would not recur. The dependence on nonrecurring revenues is one of the things that got the wealthy county into fiscal trouble in the first place.</p>
        <p>The Democrats countered that this year, under the terms of a fiscal recovery plan proposed by Gov. George E. Pataki, the county is allowed to use nonrecurring revenues to help it achieve $50 million in savings. If the county does not find the $50 million in savings by June 30, the plan calls for the state to take control of Nassau's finances.</p>
        <p>As the arguments played out, anxious investors held a conference call with analysts from Standard &amp; Poor's, the credit-rating agency, to discuss the outlook for Nassau County. The agency has warned Nassau that it will downgrade its bonds to junk status if it does not make progress in fixing its finances by June 30.</p>
        <p>Many callers said that they wanted to know whether the governor's plan -- which calls for $100 million in state aid and the creation of a financing authority to restructure some of the county's debt and oversee its attempts to cut its budget -- would help. Others asked whether the county had shown much progress in fixing its finances so far.</p>
        <p>They would probably not have been reassured by the sparring here in Nassau.</p>
        <p>Judith A. Jacobs, the Democratic presiding officer of the Legislature, accused Mr. Parola of conducting a superficial review and of failing to take into account the fact that the governor's plan allowed the use of nonrecurring cuts this year. ''It shakes our confidence in him,'' she said of the comptroller. ''He didn't do his homework.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Parola said he did not care that the state had said it would allow the county to use nonrecurring savings. ''It is the position of this office that they cannot wait to find recurring revenues until next year,'' he said. ''They have to bite the bullet.''</p>
        <p>And he accused the Democrats of acting like County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta, whose reliance on nonrecurring revenues in the past has drawn heavy criticism. ''They campaigned and got elected to end that kind of Gulotta-ism,'' he said.</p>
        <p>To which Ms. Jacobs replied: ''Nobody has been more critical than us about the use of nonrecurring revenues. No one understands better than us. But we're halfway through 2000 and we have to act.''</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Republicans in the County Legislature, Robert Lazaro, said: ''The most important thing is that we all work together. None of this is helpful.''</p>
        <p>Adding to the uncertainty, many county officials now have their eyes on Albany. The governor's plan requires the approval of both county officials and the State Legislature. Officials in the county say they are waiting for a final draft of the bill from Albany so that they can examine the details and act on it.</p>
        <p>And some are worried that a battle that broke out this week for the leadership of the State Assembly could change the reception it gets there.</p>
