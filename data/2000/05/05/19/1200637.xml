        <p>ALLAN HOUSTON was played so closely by Dan Majerle Wednesday in Game 5 of the Heat-Knicks playoff series that it appeared he'd know if Majerle had eaten onions on his steak for his pregame meal, or had radishes in his salad.</p>
        <p>''I couldn't tell,'' Houston said yesterday at a gathering of the team at SUNY-Purchase to discuss strategy for tonight's ultimate, or penultimate, series game. ''But then,'' added Houston, with a pause and a shrug, ''I wasn't trying.''</p>
        <p>Houston, truly, had other things on his mind. Like trying to scrounge a few unoccupied inches to get liberated for a jump shot. In fact, at some points, Houston darted around the court looking as if he had grown a second head, one that mightily resembled Dan Majerle.</p>
        <p>The fact that Majerle hit a couple of late, game-deciding shots, but did so with such difficulty -- one 3-point shot was drilled from so far away it would have been fair to award him 4 points -- illustrates the ferocious intensity, the delicious drama, the, yes, Dear Diary, sheer power, beauty and magic of the entertainment of this series between these two fabled rivals.</p>
        <p>The Hatfields and McCoys never had it so good. Troy and Greece might have looked on in envy. The Heat and the Knicks have played 10 straight desperately fought playoff games over two years and no team has won back-to-back games. If the Heat, ahead in the series, three games to two, accomplishes this feat tonight, it moves on to the Eastern Conference finals. The Knicks hit the beach. If the series runs true to form, the seventh and final game will be played Sunday in Miami.</p>
        <p>It has been heard in assorted precincts in New York that this series is less than artistic. ''Ugly,'' actually. Beauty, however, is in the eye of the beholder, as Voltaire, or Yogi Berra, or somebody said. And what is beheld here is some of the best basketball that can be played, and under the most extreme circumstances. Every possession is contested, every step is often met by a counterstep, every loose ball is pounced upon like a purse on a sidewalk.</p>
        <p>And yet the Knicks in Game 5 had only 7 turnovers and the Heat 10, when those teams average about 15 turnovers a game during the regular season. And the turnovers come not so much on a ball dribbled out of bounds, but on a steal (Latrell Sprewell, for one, had four steals Wednesday). And considering that every time someone takes a shot he is covered like scaffolding, the shooting percentages (42 for the Knicks, 40 for the Heat in the series, and 47 and 42, respectively, in Game 5) are superb. The Knicks, moreover, shot 54 percent in the second half of the last game, and still lost!</p>
        <p>''We're so evenly matched,'' said Jeff Van Gundy, the Knicks coach. ''We've got good players, good character and both teams want to win.''</p>
        <p>Both teams want to win so badly that Patrick Ewing, bad back, aging knees and sometimes suspect ego, is willing himself to battle with heart-rending vigor. And both teams want to win with such lust that Tim Hardaway, who is playing on a left foot that makes him wince with pain when he cuts, is driving to the hoop and opening up generous scoring opportunities for his team.</p>
        <p>Some, like Van Gundy, may complain about the paucity of Knick rebounding. But Miami is a taller team, and, except for the too frequent vanishing trick of Marcus Camby, is scrambling for the ricochets. Van Gundy, in his heart, understands. And the thing always to expect when these two teams meet in the playoffs is the unexpected. One day the Heat shoots free throws as though aiming at a moving target. Then Anthony Carter, a refugee from the Atlanta playgrounds, hits a game-winner that soars from behind the basket, the ball looking, for a moment, like it was a bag of peanuts flung from a vendor in the nearby aisle. Then Charlie Ward woke up the other morning and thought he was Michael Jordan.</p>
        <p>''When you're in the middle of this thing,'' said Sprewell, ''it's hard to appeciate it like a fan. But, as a player, this kind of hard fighting is fun. It's what you dream about as a kid in the playgrounds. It's exciting to compete on this level. In the playoffs the stakes are higher than the regular season. Every play is crucial.''</p>
        <p>Van Gundy, meanwhile, had his car destroyed when a large amount of thrust emitted from one engine of the private plane carrying the team from Miami to Westchester lifted the Honda Civic and caused it to roll over several staff and player cars. How did he feel? ''Who cares,'' he said. ''We lost. If we had won, I'd have been happy to walk back from Miami.''</p>
        <p>Talk about playoff intensity.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 20, 2000, Saturday  A sports picture caption yesterday about Marcus Camby of the Knicks in Wednesday night's game against the Miami Heat misidentified the Heat player scoring against him. It was Clarence Weatherspoon, not Tim Hardaway.</p>
