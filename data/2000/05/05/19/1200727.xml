        <p>The coach of the United States men's national team, Bruce Arena, selected a 22-man squad yesterday for next month's Nike U.S. Cup. The team is evenly split between European-based players and those playing in Major League Soccer.</p>
        <p>The United States opens the four-nation tournament on June 4 against South Africa in Washington. The Americans will then play Ireland in Foxboro, Mass., on June 6 before the tournament concludes with a doubleheader on June 11 with the United States playing Mexico, and Ireland against South Africa at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. The tournament is Arena's last opportunity under match conditions to assess the team before qualifying games for the 2002 World Cup begin in mid-July.</p>

        <p>The United States opens the four-nation tournament on June 4 against South Africa in Washington. The Americans will then play Ireland in Foxboro, Mass., on June 6 before the tournament concludes with a doubleheader on June 11 with the United States playing Mexico, and Ireland against South Africa at Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. The tournament is Arena's last opportunity under match conditions to assess the team before qualifying games for the 2002 World Cup begin in mid-July.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the biggest surprises are the selections of the goalkeepers, Kasey Keller and Brad Friedel. Since he became the coach in 1998, Arena has generally tried to picked in-form players for national team duty. Neither Keller, at Rayo Vallecano in Spain, nor Friedel, at Liverpool in England, have ended their league seasons as starters. Overlooked was Tony Meola of M.L.S.'s Kansas City Wizards, who is the league's leading goalkeeper.</p>
        <p>On offense, Arena hopes the addition of Ante Razov (six national team appearances) and Jason Kreis (11 appearances) will inject some verve into a struggling attack.</p>

        <p>ENGLAND APOLOGIZES FOR RIOTING: The English Football Association apologized to Denmark yesterday for the fan violence that marred the UEFA Cup final in Copenhagen and called for tighter controls to stop hooligans from traveling to next month's European championships.</p>
        <p>Dozens of fans were injured, including four who were stabbed, and 63 were arrested in fighting between rampaging mobs of English and Turkish supporters in the Danish capital Wednesday night before Galatasaray beat Arsenal, 4-1, in a penalty shootout after the game ended scoreless.</p>
        <p>''We apologize to the Danes for what happened in the last 48 hours,'' said David Davies, executive director of the English F.A. ''The people of that hospitable city deserve better, much better. They deserve the apologies of ourselves and of the Turks. There are absolutely no excuses.''</p>
        <p>The 19 Britons and 15 Turks who were arrested had left Denmark yesterday. All those charged were fined more than $500 and banned from entering Denmark for one year.</p>
        <p>In Turkey, nationwide celebrations of Galatasaray's victory were marred by brawls and celebratory gunfire early yesterday that left 2 dead and 22 injured.</p>
        <p>In England, hundreds of Arsenal fans rampaged through North London, attacking Turkish businesses, throwing bottles and smashing windows. Six people were arrested and three policemen were injured.</p>
        <p>The violence occurred Wednesday night in the Finsbury Park area surrounding Arsenal's home stadium at Highbury. (AP)</p>
        <p>LAZIO WINS ITALIAN CUP: Four days after winning its first Italian League title since 1974, Lazio of Rome won the Italian Cup with a scoreless tie yesterday against host Internazionale of Milan.</p>
        <p>Lazio won the home-and-home, total-goals final on 2-1 aggregate. It was the third Italian Cup for Lazio, its second in three years.</p>
        <p>Lazio became only the fourth club in Italian soccer history to win the double, after Juventus, Torino and Napoli. (AP)</p>
