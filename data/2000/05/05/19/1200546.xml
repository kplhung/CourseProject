        <p>Now Playing</p>
        <p>''BATTLEFIELD EARTH,'' starring John Travolta and Barry Pepper. Directed by Roger Christian (PG-13, 117 minutes). In the year 3000, beings from the planet Psychlo conquer Earth in only nine minutes and reduce all humans to grunting illiterates. The chief nasty, Terl (Mr. Travolta), devises a scheme to put the man-animals to work in the gold mines for him. He sees potential in one cave dweller (Mr. Pepper) and straps him to a machine that beams the wisdom of the ages into his head. Little does Terl realize that by educating a human, he is sowing the seeds of his own destruction. Sitting through this film with its stock villains is like watching the most expensively mounted high school play of all time. It may be a bit early to make such judgments, but ''Battlefield Earth'' may well turn out to be the worst movie of this century (Elvis Mitchell).</p>

        <p>''BATTLEFIELD EARTH,'' starring John Travolta and Barry Pepper. Directed by Roger Christian (PG-13, 117 minutes). In the year 3000, beings from the planet Psychlo conquer Earth in only nine minutes and reduce all humans to grunting illiterates.

Sitting through this film with its stock villains is like watching the most expensively mounted high school play of all time. It may be a bit early to make such judgments, but ''Battlefield Earth'' may well turn out to be the worst movie of this century (Elvis Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''CENTER STAGE,'' starring Ethan Stiefel, Sascha Radetsky, Amanda Schull, Peter Gallagher and Donna Murphy. Directed by Nicholas Hytner (PG-13, 113 minutes). Mr. Hytner's film tracks the professional and romantic travails of a group of young dancers at the fictitious American Ballet Academy in New York. The script is a patchwork of showbiz movie and romantic comedy cliches, and the acting rarely rises above daytime soap-opera obviousness, but who ever went to a dance movie to see good writing or realistic acting? The movie is loaded with lively dance sequences, and Mr. Hytner films them beautifully, especially the show-stopping finale, choreographed by Susan Stroman and spiritedly danced by Mr. Stiefel, Mr. Radetsky and the lovely Ms. Schull, who carries the movie with her energy and grace (A. O. Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''EAST-WEST,'' starring Sandrine Bonnaire, Oleg Menchikov and Catherine Deneuve. Directed by Regis Wargnier (PG-13, 115 minutes). After World War II the Soviet government undertook a propaganda campaign to entice Russians living in the West to return home. Aleksei Golovine (Mr. Menchikov) and his French wife, Marie (Ms. Bonnaire), the couple at the heart of Mr. Wargnier's sumptuous, moving historical melodrama, are luckier than most of their fellow returnees, who are killed or imprisoned on arrival. ''East-West'' chronicles Aleksei's ambivalence about their new life in a drab, depressing communal apartment and Marie's desperate attempts to escape it. The film may be faulted for dissolving the horrors of history in Hollywood-style catharsis, but it also uses the resources of old-fashioned emotionally emphatic filmmaking to shed light on forgotten history. ''East-West'' is a grand costume pageant, full of grandeur and period detail, but it is also the portrait of a marriage under extreme external and internal pressure, and a showcase for two great film actresses: Ms. Bonnaire and Ms. Deneuve, playing an actress who becomes aware of Marie's plight during a tour of the Soviet Union (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''THE FILTH AND THE FURY.'' Directed by Julien Temple (R, 105 minutes). If you thought the passage of time had rendered the Sex Pistols quaint objects of pop-culture nostalgia, Mr. Temple's electrifying new documentary will make you think again. The film presents the great, short-lived British punk band in all its scabrous glory -- spewing obscenities on British television, spitting at journalists and fans and generally smashing through the drabness and hypocrisy of 1970's Britain like a brick through a shop window. At a time when every obscenity or aesthetic shock tactic feels like the product of either careful market research or dutiful graduate-school training, the filth and the fury of British punk rock at its moment of impact retains a surprising dignity. These guys hated everything, but at least they believed in something. Nihilism like this makes you glad to be alive (Scott).</p>
        <p>* ''FREQUENCY,'' starring Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel. Directed by Gregory Hoblit (PG-13, 100 minutes). ''Back to the Future'' meets ''Field of Dreams'' meets ''It's a Wonderful Life'' meets ''The Sixth Sense'' in this entertaining but shamelessly sentimental supernatural soap opera with a macho heart. Mr. Caviezel is a morose young policeman who contacts his dead father, a heroic firefighter, on a ham radio and contrives to save him from the accident that cost him his life during the 1969 World Series. From here, the two collaborate on changing other aspects of the past and on catching a serial killer. There are enough testosterone tears to soak Shea Stadium (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>''GLADIATOR,'' starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Richard Harris and Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott (R, 150 minutes). This movie is the answer to a question no one bothered to ask: What would happen if someone decided to film the imminent extreme football league as if it were a Chanel commercial? Mr. Scott subjects action-packed bouts of mayhem and decapitation in the Roman Colosseum to his glossy, inhuman directing style; it is admirable but repellent. Mr. Crowe is the noble Roman general who ends up fighting for his life. Mr. Crowe gives a performance with ball-of-fire intensity, suffused with a movie star's impatience. He holds the movie together, such as it is (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>* ''HAMLET,'' starring Ethan Hawke, Liev Schreiber, Julia Stiles, Bill Murray, Diane Venora and Sam Shepard. Directed by Michael Almereyda (R, 112 minutes). Mr. Almereyda has rooted his voluptuous and rewarding new adaptation of Shakespeare's play in today's Manhattan. The city's contradictions of beauty and squalor give the movie a sense of place, and New York becomes a complex character in this vital and sharply intelligent film. Often shaded in lush, soothing hues of blue, ''Hamlet'' exudes an intoxicating masochism in which half the cast is battling despondency and the other half has the glint of imminent insanity. Here, the melancholy of Hamlet (Mr. Hawke) over the death of his father is almost a state of grace: it gives him a sense of purpose that the other characters lack. The director's rigorous trimming has a boldness and vivacity that makes this version exhilarating while leaving Shakespeare's language and intent intact (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''I DREAMED OF AFRICA,'' starring Kim Basinger and Vincent Perez. Directed by Hugh Hudson (PG-13, 120 minutes). This screen adaptation of Kuki Gallmann's memoir about her life in Kenya with an adventurer husband and two children is little more than a picturesque travelogue. Although the story is loaded with tragedy, a stiff, expository screenplay and mostly weak performances keep it from resonating. Ms. Basinger's spaced-out baby-doll Kuki and Mr. Perez's petulant husband render this conservation-minded couple remote and vaguely unsympathetic. That couldn't have been the movie's intention (Holden).</p>
        <p>''KEEPING THE FAITH,'' starring Edward Norton, Ben Stiller and Jenna Elfman. Directed by Mr. Norton (PG-13, 129 minutes). Mr. Norton doubles as actor and director in this competent comedy with a premise that's both high concept and the punch line to a barroom joke: a priest (Mr. Norton) and a rabbi (Mr. Stiller) fall in love with a woman (Ms. Elfman) they've known since they were children. Mr. Norton wisely chose not to make himself the star. He places that burden on Mr. Stiller's shoulders, and both seem to be doing Woody Allen to compensate for the underwritten material (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''LOVE AND BASKETBALL,'' starring Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps. Directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood (PG-13, 118 minutes). The writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood's feature-film debut, about the romantic and competitive bond between the basketball players Monica (Ms. Lathan) and Quincy (Mr. Epps), has an enchanting, lived-in homeyness. Ms. Prince-Bythewood does a wonderful job of creating an atmosphere for her characters -- particularly for the superb Ms. Lathan -- but the movie fails to fashion a consistent narrative. It doesn't seem to be about anything. But it is a promising first movie from a filmmaker with a lot to offer. Who knew anyone could get a drama out of Title IX, the Federal law ensuring that girls get a chance to compete in high school sports? (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>* ''TIME CODE,'' starring Jeanne Tripplehorn, Saffron Burrows, Holly Hunter and Stellan Skarsgard. Directed by Mike Figgis (R, 93 minutes). Mr. Figgis's astonishing new film, shot in a single day with hand-held digital video cameras, tells four stories simultaneously, in real time. ''Time Code'' is at once a mordant satire of the hypocrisy and self-delusion of the film industry and an earnest declaration of faith in the medium itself. In addition to its technical innovations, which test the limits of the human eye, ear and mind, the film boasts some brilliant improvisational acting from its enormous cast. Especially fine are Ms. Tripplehorn and Mr. Skarsgard, whose strongly emotional performances add a measure of pathos. Whether ''Time Code'' will ultimately be seen as a bold prophecy of the dawning visual age or as a passionate, gimmicky curio is for the future to decide. At present, though, it is hard to think of a more exciting demonstration of the inexhaustible possibilities of film (Scott).</p>
        <p>''U-571,'' starring Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, Jon Bon Jovi, David Keith and Harvey Keitel. Directed by Jonathan Mostow (PG-13, 120 minutes). Mr. Mostow, whose previous film, ''Breakdown,'' was a marvel of B-picture minimalism, shifts from the wide-open spaces to the cramped interior of a World War II submarine movie. Mr. McConaughey, whose knotted-with-unease face makes it look as if he is cramming for finals, is part of a secret mission to capture a Nazi code-encryption machine and get it back to the Allies. He and his crew have to do so on a Nazi U-boat they have hijacked. Mr. Mostow does a fine job of building tension, given that he is working in a minor genre whose climactic notes you will know if you have ever seen a movie set on a sub (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>''THE VIRGIN SUICIDES,'' starring Kirsten Dunst, James Woods and Kathleen Turner. Directed by Sofia Coppola (R, 97 minutes). Ms. Coppola's directorial debut, adapted from Jeffrey Eugenides's 1993 novel about the self-destruction of five sisters in a 1970's Michigan suburb, shows her to be a filmmaker with fine visual and emotional instincts, adept at matching the book's hypnotic, sensual black humor. The movie's best moments have an inspired feeling of playfulness and freedom matched by Ms. Dunst's smart, beguiling performance as Lux Lisbon, whose sexual awakening propels her and her sisters to their doom. But despite Ms. Coppola's keen instincts, and the beautifully understated acting of Mr. Woods and Ms. Turner as the Lisbon parents, ''The Virgin Suicides'' is marred by the self-conscious aestheticism and emotional detachment of its source (Scott).</p>
        <p>''WHERE THE HEART IS,'' starring Natalie Portman and Ashley Judd. Directed by Matt Williams (PG-13, 115 minutes). Young Novalee Nation (Ms. Portman) is terribly phobic about the number five, and about five minutes into this astonishingly shameless melodrama with its lower-class sweetheart heroine, you will start to feel exactly the same way. The movie seems to be stuck with its own five fixation, too, because a new character or situation is introduced every five minutes, or so it feels, to keep things lively. Abandoned by her boyfriend, Novalee gives birth in a Wal-Mart. She later befriends a nurse (Ms. Judd), a single mom with a passel of children, and takes up photography. The audience doesn't get credit for being able to track a character through life without the film's being stuffed with enough nutty incidents -- a kidnapping, catastrophic storms -- for an entire season of television (Mitchell).</p>
        <p>Film Series</p>
        <p>THE SIXTH AFRICAN FILM FESTIVAL.  With 10 United States premieres and 2 New York premieres, the African Film Festival begins today at the Walter Reade Theater.
