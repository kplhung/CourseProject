        <p>Sleepy Hollow</p>
        <p>Heads roll and roll in Tim Burton's exuberantly dark and expressionistic reworking of the Washington Irving story. Sent up the Hudson River to investigate some killings, the squeamish detective Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp, left, with Christina Ricci) encounters a horseman from hell (Christopher Walken), headless himself, hacking a seemingly random swath through the conspiratorial citizenry of Sleepy Hollow. Mr. Burton renders the Irving story unrecognizable, but an ornate fantasy should make its own rules, and, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, '' 'Sleepy Hollow' does that with macabre gusto.''</p>

        <p>Sleepy Hollow</p>
        <p>Heads roll and roll in Tim Burton's exuberantly dark and expressionistic reworking of the Washington Irving story. Sent up the Hudson River to investigate some killings, the squeamish detective Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp, left, with Christina Ricci) encounters a horseman from hell (Christopher Walken), headless himself, hacking a seemingly random swath through the conspiratorial citizenry of Sleepy Hollow. Mr. Burton renders the Irving story unrecognizable, but an ornate fantasy should make its own rules, and, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, '' 'Sleepy Hollow' does that with macabre gusto.''</p>
        <p>1999. Paramount. $107.37; DVD, $29.99. 105 minutes. Closed captioned. R. Release date: May 23.</p>
        <p>The World Is Not Enough</p>
        <p>From a traditional swift opening, Michael Apted's film lifts the James Bond franchise onto a somewhat more mature plane. As Elektra, Sophie Marceau gets slinky costumes and skiing and boudoir sequences befitting an ally of the terrorist Renard (Robert Carlyle). Conversely, Denise Richards seems barely out of high school as a scientist whose expertise with plutonium is counted upon to deliver the world from Renard. The elevation is provided by 007 himself. In his third Bond film, Pierce Brosnan ''bears noticeably more resemblance to a real human being'' (Maslin).</p>
        <p>1999. MGM. $19.98; DVD, $34.98. 128 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.</p>
        <p>Anywhere but Here</p>
        <p>Like ''Tumbleweeds,'' Wayne Wang's film follows a mother and daughter on a cross-country escape. ''You're gonna die one day too, Mom, just like the rest of us,'' the 14-year-old Ann (Natalie Portman) says sarcastically to her mother, Adele (Susan Sarandon), before the two leave Bay City, Wis. ''But not in this town,'' Adele replies. For no good reason Adele has gotten it into her head that life holds more promise in Beverly Hills, Calif. Being the more mature of the two, Ann tries to be a teenager while acting as anchor for a childish parent. As for Mr. Wang, he ''once again works splendidly with actresses, and boy, does he have a lot to work with this time'' (Maslin).</p>
        <p>1999. Fox. $107.37; DVD, $34.98. 114 minutes. Closed captioned. PG-13.</p>
        <p>Eye of the Beholder</p>
        <p>A peripatetic psychopathic killer (Ashley Judd) changes wigs and aliases every few minutes on a deadly run from New York to Alaska. On her trail, a British intelligence agent and surveillance expert called the Eye (Ewan McGregor) always stays in the same hotel as she does, pressing his ear to the bathroom tile to hear her splashing around in the tub beyond the wall. The Eye also has visions of the young daughter he hasn't seen in years, which leaves him consumed with guilt, or so we are left to believe in Stephan Elliott's ''impenetrable mess of a movie'' (Stephen Holden).</p>
        <p>2000. Columbia Tri-Star. $105.77; DVD, $24.95. 102 minutes. Closed captioned. Release date: May 23.</p>
        <p>Straight to Video</p>
        <p>Other new titles of interest, some of which may have had a theater release, appeared on television or been on videocassette in earlier editions.</p>
        <p>THE SOURCE. Chuck Workman's stirring kaleidoscopic documentary with dramatized readings reveals much about the Beat writers Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and William Burroughs. (Even viewers who know a lot about Kerouac may be surprised by his later talk-show appearances.) Johnny Depp intones Kerouac, Dennis Hopper echoes Burroughs and John Turturro puts fierce emotion into Ginsberg's ''Howl.'' Those interviewed include Ginsberg, Kerouac, Neal Cassady and Norman Mailer, and music is provided by Philip Glass, Bob Dylan, Dizzy Gillespie, Thelonious Monk and many others. ''However well known the assorted Beat legends have become,'' Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times, ''there is a cumulative power to seeing so many of them evoked so colorfully in a single film.'' 1999. Winstar. $19.98; DVD, $24.98. 89 minutes. No rating. Release date: May 23.</p>
        <p>THE MAN WITH BOGART'S FACE. A former cop (Robert Sacchi) remodels himself to look like his favorite tough guy, and slides into a Bogey-style case resembling ''The Maltese Falcon.'' Mr. Sacchi is fine in Robert Day's film, adapted from Andrew J. Fenaday's novel, and Victor Buono and Herbert Lom do nicely in the ''Falcon's'' Sidney Greenstreet and Peter Lorre roles. 1980. Fox. $9.98. 106 minutes. PG. Release date: May 23.</p>
        <p>MESMER. Alan Rickman stars as the 18th-century Viennese hypnotist and self-promoter in Roger Spottiswoode's film, written by Dennis Potter. 1994. First Look. $24.98. 107 minutes. Release date. May 23.</p>
