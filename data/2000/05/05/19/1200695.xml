      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The board of directors of the group that owns the Edmonton Oilers met in an emergency session for more than three hours yesterday to map out a plan to try to control the fate of Glen Sather, the Oilers' president and general manager.</p>
        <p>Sather is considered to be the Rangers' first choice for their vacant team presidency.</p>
        <p>The board of the 37-member Edmonton Investors Group Ltd. discussed the team's budget, which would have to reach a certain threshold to prevent Sather from exercising an escape clause in his contract. The board also investigated the possibility of filing tampering charges against the Rangers.</p>
        <p>''Just to grant permission to talk or negotiate means that you've said that you are prepared to take an asset and give it away for nothing,'' Cal Nichols, the chairman of the group, said. ''We're not prepared to do that.''</p>
        <p>When Nichols was asked if the Oilers would drop their intentions to investigate whether there was any tampering if the Rangers offered them compensation in order to speak to -- and eventually -- lure Sather away, Nichols's response was telling.</p>
        <p>''You would always be compelled to talk to people,'' said Nichols, who plans to speak to Sather today. ''That is not something that we really want. But we have to be open minded.''</p>
        <p>Last night, Sather came his closest yet to indicating it is time he moved on. He expressed his frustration at running a team ''in a survival mode'' as compared to one that had the resources to challenge for a Stanley Cup.</p>
        <p>Sather was asked if he thought that the Oilers were sending a message that they were willing to let him out of his contract, as long as they were compensated in return. Sather said he felt the final decision would be up to him.</p>
        <p>''The way I look at it,'' Sather said from his La Quinta, Calif., home, ''I've been there 25 years. I don't think compensation is the question. We'll see how things unfold over the next few days.''</p>
        <p>Sather was then asked if he was closer than before to leaving Edmonton.</p>
        <p>''Are you a betting man?'' he said, with a laugh. He mentioned all the family and friends and relationships he has in Edmonton and through the Oilers' organization. ''But maybe at some point, it's time to think about other things.''</p>
        <p>Sather played left wing for the Rangers for four seasons, from 1970 to'73. Every day, a return to New York seems closer.</p>
        <p>''I've never talked about a deal with anyone,'' Sather said. But, he added again, he will wait to see how things turn out in the next few days.</p>
        <p>Sather has had verbal, but not written, permission to meet with the Rangers. The two sides have met twice in the last two weeks. Nichols maintains that the Rangers, or any other team interested in speaking to Sather, must ask for permission in writing and then receive that permission in writing, or else tampering has taken place.</p>
        <p>Sather is in the middle of a power struggle between Nichols, the team chairman, and Jim Hole, the former chairman. Hole is a close ally of Sather's and the person who gave the Rangers verbal permission to approach Sather. Sather, 56, has had a job with the Oilers, in one form or another, for the last 24 years, the last 21 of which he has spent as the team's general manager.</p>
        <p>Sather also has two seasons remaining on his current contract, which pays him nearly $2 million a season. But Sather wrote an escape clause into the contract, which states that he can walk away from the cash-poor Oilers if their budget is not in line with the rest of the league.</p>
        <p>''We looked at a first cut of our draft budget,'' Nichols said last night. ''We want to make sure we cover all bases as it relates to Glen Sather's contract, so we are sure that we have done the best we can to meet the formula.''</p>
        <p>The formula that Sather's escape clause is based upon is fairly complex. The top three and bottom three payrolls of the 30-team National Hockey League next season are thrown out (as, obviously, is the Oilers'). The Edmonton payroll must meet, in Nichols's words, ''part of the average'' payroll of the remaining 23 teams (when expansion kicks in).</p>
        <p>According to figures compiled by The National Post, a Canadian newspaper, Edmonton's payroll of $21,204,500 this season ranked 22nd in the current 28-team league. The average of the other 21 teams within the formula in Sather's contract was $32,452,190. Although Nichols would not reveal what percentage the Oilers must come within the average, it is believed to be just over 75 percent. Seventy-five percent of this season's formula was $24,339,142, a payroll increase of over $3 million.</p>
