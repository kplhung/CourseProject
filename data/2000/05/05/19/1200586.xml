        <p>In a ruling released yesterday, a New Jersey administrative panel told PepsiCo that it must pay overtime to hundreds of drivers who worked for the company between 1993 and 1995.</p>

        <p>In a ruling released yesterday, a New Jersey administrative panel told PepsiCo that it must pay overtime to hundreds of drivers who worked for the company between 1993 and 1995.</p>
        <p>At issue was the job description for the drivers, whom Pepsi calls customer representatives and bulk customer representatives, depending on the kinds of routes they worked. Pepsi contended that the drivers were outside sales representatives, who earned commissions on their sales of Pepsi, Mountain Dew and other products.</p>
        <p>But a lawyer for the drivers said their hours and movements were closely controlled by Pepsi. ''This was not Willy Loman,'' said the lawyer, James Linsey, who brought the drivers' case before New Jersey's Office of Administrative Law. ''Their hours were strictly regulated.'' Many of the drivers worked 50 to 80 hours a week, he said, but were not paid overtime.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the Pepsi Bottling Group, which now oversees Pepsi's bottling operations in much of New Jersey, said she had not seen the ruling and could not comment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Linsey said the decision could affect Pepsi drivers across the country.</p>
