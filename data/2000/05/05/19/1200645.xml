        <p>Bernard Arnault is not a man who makes the same mistake twice. Ever since LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton bought Phillips Auctioneers in October, Mr. Arnault, its chairman, has been determined to make the house -- a distant third to Sotheby's and Christie's -- a major player in the art world. Last week, Phillips's first evening sale of important Impressionist and modern art was something of a disaster: about 40 percent of the works went unsold.</p>
        <p>Last night, Phillips tried again, this time with 39 works of contemporary art. But this time Phillips was smart: estimates were low, or at least at market prices. As a result, the sale totaled $11 million, just under its high estimate of $11.2 million. Of the 39 works up, 2 failed to sell.</p>
        <p>The demand for contemporary art was great, as it had been earlier this week at Sotheby's and Christie's, and buyers were willing to pay mightily. Records have been set all week, and last night several more could be added to the list, for Agnes Martin and Damien Hirst, among other artists.</p>
        <p>Phillips's sale included modern masters like Andy Warhol and Ms Martin, as well as trendier artists like Mr. Hirst and Robert Gober, who has just been named to represent the United States at next year's Venice Biennale. (Related article, Inside Art, page 30 of Weekend.)</p>
        <p>In the American Craft Museum on West 53rd Street -- a space LVMH has rented and spent more than $1 million to renovate for these sales -- major dealers bid avidly, some for stock, others for clients.</p>
        <p>But drawing a crowd must have cost LVMH a considerable sum. Of the lots offered last night, 30 came with some form of financing from Phillips: a guarantee (an undisclosed minimum price promised to the seller regardless of a sale's outcome), an advance, a loan or a combination of the three. Often, competitors said, Mr. Arnault had paid more for the works than their estimates.</p>
        <p>But the sensible estimates encouraged bidding. Among the star works was ''Apple Orchard,'' a 1987 landscape by Gerhard Richter that had recently been on view at an art fair in Munich. Lucy Mitchell-Innes, the Manhattan dealer, won her battle against another bidder, paying $1.6 million, nicely above the painting's high estimate of $1.2 million.</p>
        <p>Another sought-after painting was Ms. Martin's ''Drift of Summer'' (1965), a white abstract grid. Estimated at $800,000 to $1 million, it sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $1.4 million after five people competed for it. The price more than doubled the artist's previous record, $525,000 for ''The Tree,'' a 1964 grid painting sold at Sotheby's in 1996.</p>
        <p>A record was also set for Mr. Hirst. ''Out of Sight, Out of Mind,'' a 1991 work consisting of two cow heads preserved in formaldehyde, sold to an unidentified buyer for $552,500, far above its $400,000 high estimate. It eclipsed Mr. Hirst's previous record, set last year when ''My Way,'' one of his pharmaceutical cabinet assemblages, sold for $354,500.</p>
        <p>A salesroom announcement made before bidding was opened on the piece explained that it was in London and had been cleared by British customs. If the purchaser was in either Britain or the European Union, the work could be picked up immediately, the announcement said, ''but if purchased by a client in the United States, U.S. Customs will require the new owner to sign an affidavit stating that they will not use the medium in any way other than for the purpose of an art exhibition, as to prevent the potential threat of mad cow disease or any other hazardous epidemic that can be associated with the natural decay of dead animal tissue.''</p>
        <p>Another work by Mr. Hirst was up for sale: the photograph ''With Dead Head,'' part of an edition of 15 made from 1981 to 1991. Estimated at $30,000 to $40,000, it went to an unidentified telephone bidder for $74,000, the same price another print brought at Christie's last year.</p>
        <p>(Final prices include Phillips's commission, 15 percent of the first $50,000 and 10 percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)</p>
        <p>Cindy Sherman's ''Untitled Film Still No. 13'' (1978), a photograph of a blonde reaching for a book, was estimated at $80,000 to $120,000. It sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $167,500. Christie's sold another print  last May for $156,500. A self-portrait of Ms. Sherman posed as an Old Master sold last night to an unidentified bidder for $79,500, just under its low estimate of $80,000. On Tuesday night, a similar Sherman work sold at Sotheby's for $269,750.</p>
        <p>Matthew Barney's ''Envelopa: Drawing Restraint 7 (Guillotine),'' from 1993, was for up sale last night. This group of six photographs, from an edition of 10 plus two artist's proofs, was estimated at $60,000 to $80,000; Stellan Holm, a Swedish dealer living in New York, bought it for $101,500. In 1998 Christie's sold an edition of the same work for $123,500.</p>
        <p>Thomas Struth's photographs have performed well at auction this week. Last night, Vivian Horan, a Manhattan dealer, bought ''The Gallery at the Academy I'' (1992) for $200,500, more than twice its high estimate of $90,000. On Monday and Tuesday nights, photographs by Mr. Struth sold for as much as $270,000.</p>
        <p>Some works sold at the low end.  Jean-Michel Basquiat's ''Peter and the Wolf,'' a 1985 graffiti painting, was estimated at $600,000 to $800,000. It sold for $662,500.</p>
        <p>Leaving the sale, Anthony d'Offay, a leading London dealer, said he thought the auction ''established that they seriously want to be part of the game.'' Those sentiments were echoed by Christopher Thomson, Phillips chief executive, who said: ''This evening won't be the last. Our ambition is to move the business to the upper end of the market, and this is a significant step forward.''</p>
