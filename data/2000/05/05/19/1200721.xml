        <p>Results of tests on the former Montreal Canadiens great Maurice Richard for a suspected recurrence of abdominal cancer are expected next week, his agent said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The agent, Jean Roy, said Richard, 78, known as the Rocket, may be released from Hotel Dieu hospital in Montreal today.</p>
        <p>Richard, who scored a team-record 544 goals for the Canadiens in the 1940's and 1950's, was diagnosed with a rare form of abdominal cancer more than two years ago. He fell ill again recently with a painful weakening of his legs after beginning to take a new medication to control the onset of a light form of Parkinson's disease. (AP)</p>
        <p>FOOTE MAY PLAY AGAIN: Colorado defenseman Adam Foote said he's recovering more quickly than the team expected from a recent eye injury and could play again against the Dallas Stars in the Western Conference finals.</p>
        <p>Foote suffered bleeding and blurred vision in his right eye after he was hit with the blade of a stick in Game 2 of the four-of-seven series Monday at Dallas. It took four stitches to close a cut in his eyelid.</p>
        <p>Foote won't play in Game 3 tonight, though he would not rule out playing after that.</p>
        <p>''If it keeps improving the way it has, there's a great possibility that I'll be back,'' Foote said. (Bloomberg News)</p>
