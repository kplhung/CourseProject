        <p>In one 72-hour mood swing, the same good-time Knicks who were dizzy in the afterglow of their Sunday victory began bickering on the floor by the second quarter of Wednesday night's Game 5.</p>
        <p>That discord set the tone for the team's mental unraveling on defense minutes before the final buzzer of their miserable loss in Miami, a dispiriting defeat that left last year's Eastern Conference champions one game from elimination as Friday's Game 6 at Madison Square Garden approaches.</p>
        <p>All of this was unsettling enough before another calamity unfolded around 3 a.m. this morning when the Knicks' team plane landed in Westchester County. In a freakish incident, a large amount of thrust was emitted from one engine as the plane neared the team's parking area. The blast lifted Coach Jeff Van Gundy's Honda Civic and tossed it like a tumbleweed as it rolled over several staff and player cars, including the Mercedes of Allan Houston.</p>
        <p>''What can you say?'' Latrell Sprewell said. ''Things were already bad and then to have that happen, it was the cap for the night.''</p>
        <p>This is the first time this season such destructive forces -- whether on the court or off it -- have existed in the midst of a team that has generally been a dysfunction-free zone. With almost everyone healthy and well fed by their contracts, with nearly everyone safe and snug in their job security, the Knicks are missing the kind of desperate air the Heat has fed off to take a three games-to-two lead in this four-of-seven-game, second-round series.</p>
        <p>The less-talented Heat understands that if it is eliminated, Coach Pat Riley might dismantle the team and start over. And the Heat is dead set on slaying the Knick demons, which have dogged Miami for two early off-seasons. The Knicks, the year-long favorite to reach the finals again, have been missing that little something extra this time around. ''It's just hunger,'' Houston said. ''Just that feeling of us against the world. We don't have that.''</p>
        <p>But now there is a sign of that glorious, motivational dysfunction sprouting in the cracks of the Knicks. Now, the Knicks either win or get humiliated by the Heat. Now, Marcus Camby either finishes strong with an offensive rebound or he could return to the same fragile label he fought so hard to peel off last year. Now, the vanishing Houston either shakes the crusty, throw-back defense of Dan Majerle or he could find his All-Star status second-guessed. Now, Patrick Ewing either puts a body on Alonzo Mourning or he could end up mocked for his ''I'm Still Great'' speech.</p>
        <p>There is plenty of tension to galvanize the adversity-starved Knicks. And it all was laid out before them in the team's film session today. ''It was like watching a horror flick,'' said Houston, who noted that he has to assert himself more than he did in Game 5, when he was 1 of 2 in the second half. ''It was hard to watch. You wanted to say, Jeff, that's enough. We don't want to watch this, but we have to learn.''</p>
        <p>There was the moment Mourning missed two free throws and the Heat won the wrestling match for the rebound in the first quarter, and the time when Ewing called for the ball and Chris Childs angrily directed him to set a pick in the second quarter. Both snarled at each other for several minutes as the Heat overtook the lead.</p>
        <p>''We've got to be together when things aren't going our way,'' Camby said. ''We can't have guys wanting the ball and then rolling their eyes and not getting back on defense. It should be a group effort and the ego and stuff should be put aside.''</p>
        <p>Not only did Van Gundy address the infighting during a second-quarter timeout, he added a few more words about the issue in the locker room after Game 5. ''You're fighting an opponent you shouldn't be fighting which is yourself,'' Van Gundy said. ''Any time the pressure is up more you have time to fall prey to that. I think that obviously the more time you spend fighting amongst yourself, the less time you spend fighting the opponent you should be fighting. I just wish we could move on past it quicker. Say what you've got to say and then go to the next play.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks talked about moving forward today by learning from all of the mistakes they've made so far in this series. There was plenty of material. Through the five games, the most glaring breakdowns have occurred in the fourth quarter. In Game 5, the defense was confused in its rotations and gave up three 3-pointers in the last 2 minutes 30 seconds of the game. In Game 3, it was 8 costly turnovers during a fourth quarter, plus overtime. In Game 1, there were five pivotal turnovers down the stretch. But in each game, one common thread that needs attention has been rebounding, particularly on the offensive boards.</p>
        <p>This is where the Heat pokes at the Knicks every time. And since rebounding is borne out of effort, this is the area that gnaws at Van Gundy.</p>
        <p>''Get the ball,'' Van Gundy said. ''It's very simple. Hit someone and go get the ball. Anthony Carter has 26 rebounds, more than most of our big guys. If he can get the ball, you can get the ball. I said it before the series began, the team who fights for the ball is going to win. They've gone for the ball, and that's why it's 3-2.''</p>
        <p>Effort plays, unselfishness and urgency are all key elements to the Knicks' life span in this playoff series. Last year, all three of those qualities seemed to spring from the adversity they experienced together. Now, there is nothing more adverse than facing elimination. To overcome the dire situation, the Knicks will have to do what neither team has done over two years of playing each other in the playoffs: win two in a row.</p>
        <p>''It's a challenge,'' Sprewell said. ''It makes it that much more interesting to go out and overcome the odds. We know we can do it. We did it as an eighth seed that made it to the finals last year.''  L</p>
