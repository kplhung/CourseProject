        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>IRAN: REFORMERS' MAJORITY -- Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, intervened hours before the hard-line Guardian Council was to decide whether to void the results in Tehran parliamentary elections held last February because of fraud. He advised the council only to invalidate boxes where it found discrepancies but to endorse the election of those candidates whose victories were certain. Pro-reform candidates won 29 of Tehran's 30 seats, giving reformers a majority in the 290-seat Parliament.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL, LEBANON: BORDER CLASHES -- Ten people were wounded in the most intense Israeli-Lebanese fighting in two weeks as the July deadline for ending the Israeli occupation of south Lebanon neared. The injured included two Israeli soldiers, two members of the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army militia, a Hezbollah guerrilla, four Lebanese civilians and a United Nations peacekeeper, officials said.</p>

        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>RUSSIA: NEW FINANCE MINISTER -- Vladimir V. Putin named Aleksei Kudrin, left, a prominent liberal economist, as deputy prime minister for finance. He will be charged with spearheading market reforms. But the new president offered no hints about the other key members of his economic team. Mr. Kudrin, 40, had served as deputy finance chief and has held posts in the administration of  St. Petersburg's former mayor, Anatoly Sobchak.</p>
        <p>(Agence France-Presse)</p>
        <p>BRITAIN: DELAY IN ULSTER -- Hopes of restarting the suspended power-sharing government in Belfast next week were dashed as the Ulster Unionist leader, David Trimble, called off a Saturday meeting of his ruling council that was to take up an Irish Republican Army offer to permit inspection of its arms dumps. Mr. Trimble believes he needs another week to persuade his party to support a decision to go back into the government with Sinn Fein, the political allies of the I.R.A. The meeting will now be held on May 27.</p>
        <p>Warren Hoge (NYT)</p>
        <p>ITALY: ANOTHER SMOKING BAN -- The newly appointed health minister, Umberto Veronesi, a cancer specialist, presented a plan to ban smoking in all public places, including bars and discos. Mr. Veronesi faces an uphill battle. Parliament passed laws banning smoking in all public places in 1975 and again in 1996. They are widely ignored.</p>
        <p>Alessandra Stanley (NYT)</p>
        <p>AUSTRIA: FUND FOR JEWS -- Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel said Austria will start examining ways to create a new compensation fund for Jews stripped of property under the Nazis. Mr. Schussel said he had discussed the proposal with his deputy, Susanne Riess-Passer of the far-right Freedom Party.</p>

        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>MEXICO: DEAD HEAT -- Francisco Labastida and Vicente Fox, the two leading presidential candidates, are in a virtual tie, and in recent days both have lost ground to the candidate in third place, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, according to a national poll published by the newspaper Reforma. Mr. Labastida was favored by 42 percent, Mr. Fox by 40 percent and Mr. Cardenas by 16 percent, according to the poll, based on interviews with 1,547 potential voters in 32 states. The margin of error was 2.5 percent.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: GENERAL JAILED -- An army general who was made a high-ranking security official in Chiapas state was sentenced to eight years in jail for criminal negligence in the December 1997 killing of 45 Indian villagers. Gen. Julio Cesar Santiago Diaz was posted only a few hundred feet away from the site when the shootings were taking place and did nothing to stop them, the attorney general said. Two other senior state security officials received the same sentence.</p>

        <p>ASIA</p>
        <p>AFGHANISTAN: HESITANT DONORS -- The United Nations has appealed for $1.8 million to assist hundreds of thousands of drought victims in the country's southern provinces, but so far donors have contributed little money, many of them criticizing the Taliban for spending too much on war.</p>
        <p>Barry Bearak (NYT)</p>
        <p>PAKISTAN: TAX RESISTANCE -- Retailers are planning a strike against plans to tax them, presenting Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who seized power in a coup last year, with the same problem his elected predecessor, Nawaz Sharif, faced when trying to put a similar revenue plan into place.</p>
        <p>Barry Bearak (NYT)</p>
        <p>SRI LANKA: REBELS CLAIM A VICTORY -- Tamil rebels said they had seized control of two strategic roads into Jaffna and were attacking the Sri Lankan military's only airport in the region to cut supplies to 40,000 troops defending the northern peninsula, which the Tamils want as part of a homeland.</p>
        <p>(AP)</p>
        <p>SOUTH KOREA: PREMIER QUITS -- Prime Minister Park Tae Joon resigned after a court ruled that he had concealed his ownership of properties valued at $5.3 million to avoid tax payments. President Kim Dae Jung appointed Finance Minister Lee Hun Jai to serve as acting prime minister, the president's office said.</p>
        <p>(AP)</p>
        <p>AFRICA</p>
        <p>IVORY COAST: GOVERNMENT DISSOLVED -- Ivory Coast's military leader, Gen. Robert Guei, dissolved the interim government, but it was not clear whether he was moving toward elections or entrenching army rule. The move comes two days after army leaders lifted a ban on political meetings but warned all party leaders to seek government permission before leaving the country.</p>
        <p>(AP)</p>
        <p>ZIMBABWE: U.N. LAND PROGRAM -- The United Nations is offering to help Zimbabwe design a land redistribution program without the political tension and violence that has led to recent illegal seizures of farmland. Agreement to resolve the problem peacefully is necessary if Zimbabwe hopes to get help from foreign donors, the organization said.</p>
