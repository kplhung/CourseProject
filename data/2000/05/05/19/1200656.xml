        <p>In his most definitive statement yet on the status of Manager Bobby Valentine and General Manager Steve Phillips, the Mets' co-owner Fred Wilpon said yesterday that both will be with the team through the end of this season.</p>
        <p>''Absolutely,'' said Wilpon after a news conference introducing the new Class A team that will play in Queens this year. ''The manager and the general manager will finish this year with us and hopefully will continue.''</p>
        <p>The Mets have a 21-20 record, and similar mediocrity in the early months of last season led to the firing of three coaches in early June, when the team was 27-28.</p>
        <p>Wilpon has said he expects the Mets to make the playoffs this year, and the team has a payroll of nearly $80 million -- with flexibility to grow during the season, he said yesterday. But even with such expectations and investment, yesterday's comments would seem to give security to Valentine and Phillips, neither of whom is signed beyond this year.</p>
        <p>''It's the first that I've heard of anything like that, and my reaction is that, regardless of what's said or done, my integrity is such that I just do the best job that I can personally do,'' Valentine said. ''Fred has always been very supportive and extremely fair in his appraisal of my situation and, I think, Steve's also.''</p>
        <p>Valentine's future has been a constant theme for the Mets since last season. After the coaches were fired, Valentine said the team would have to improve over the next 55 games or he should not be the manager. He made a similar statement as the Mets fell into an eight-game losing streak in September that nearly cost them a playoff spot.</p>
        <p>Last month, Mets officials discussed firing Valentine over a controversy stemming from a speech he made at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. Wilpon urged Phillips to fly to Pittsburgh to clarify the issue with Valentine, and Valentine kept his job.</p>
        <p>While Wilpon has control over Valentine's future, Phillips reiterated yesterday that he would make that decision, with input from the owners. Phillips had little reaction to Wilpon's comments.</p>
        <p>''It's been made clear that that will be addressed at the end of the season, and that's the way we'll continue to operate,'' Phillips said. ''We get evaluated every day is the way I look at it. We all are evaluated on what we do and what we say every day.''</p>
        <p>Wilpon met with Valentine and Phillips for three to four hours on Wednesday. The three have met several times this year, getting together more often than they were able to last season, at Wilpon's urging.</p>
        <p>''The thrust of our meetings are what we could do to improve the team,'' Wilpon said. ''The same thrust was there when we were winning seven or eight in a row. It's the same even as we're experiencing a little down time -- what can we do to improve, what changes, what additions, what deletions, how do we see it?''</p>
        <p>The Mets opened the season with a $79.7 million payroll, trailing only the Yankees, Dodgers, Braves, Orioles and Red Sox. Wilpon said Phillips will be able to take on payroll to improve the team as the season goes on.</p>
        <p>''The financial ability to do so has never been the issue,'' Wilpon said. ''There were years past where timing was the issue. Sometimes you do it too soon and it doesn't have the effect you want. If you don't have the basic core on which to build, it's not going to help you that much. We've got the core.''</p>
        <p>With the release of Rickey Henderson and the toe injury that will keep Darryl Hamilton sidelined for several weeks, the Mets clearly need help in the outfield. They would be interested in Baltimore's B. J. Surhoff if he became available, but some in the organization are doubtful Surhoff will be a possibility because he has a limited no-trade clause and the Mets are not among the teams to which he can be traded.</p>
        <p>In any case, Phillips said, pitching is his first priority in trades. But nothing seems likely to happen soon.</p>
        <p>''People aren't motivated to really do anything now, unless it's a high-priced guy who's not performing well,'' Phillips said.</p>
        <p>The Mets are a high-priced team that has performed erratically. But Wilpon has no desire to replace his top decision-makers. ''Frankly,'' he said of Valentine and Phillips, ''I think both of them have been doing an excellent job.''</p>
