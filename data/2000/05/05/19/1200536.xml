        <p>Serge Silberman celebrated his 83rd birthday on May 1 by flying from his home in Paris to New York, where the next day he attended a screening of ''The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie,'' the Oscar-winning 1972 film he produced for his friend and longtime associate Luis Bunuel.</p>

        <p>Serge Silberman celebrated his 83rd birthday on May 1 by flying from his home in Paris to New York, where the next day he attended a screening of ''The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie,'' the Oscar-winning 1972 film he produced for his friend and longtime associate Luis Bunuel.</p>
        <p>As it happens, May 1 was also the date in 1945 when American troops liberated the Nazi camp at Ludwigslust, Germany, where Mr. Silberman had been transferred after surviving Birkenau (where his parents died) and Auschwitz. ''I have had a horrible life and a wonderful life,'' he said in his suite at the Carlyle, speaking in an English colored by a complex assortment of European accents. ''It was like being born again on my birthday.''</p>
        <p>Arriving in France after the war, he abandoned his training as a mining engineer and entered the movie business. By 1953 he had become a producer; his subsequent credits include Jean-Pierre Melville's ''Bob le Flambeur'' (1955), Jean-Jacques Beineix's ''Diva'' (1981) and Akira Kurosawa's ''Ran'' (1985).</p>
        <p>But it is Bunuel, the Spanish-born Surrealist who died in 1983, who remains the closest of his associates. ''He was older than I was, but he was like a son to me,'' Mr. Silberman said, describing the protective relationship that allowed Bunuel to realize five of his best films: ''Diary of a Chambermaid'' (1964), ''The Milky Way'' (1969), ''The Phantom of Liberty'' (1974) and ''That Obscure Object of Desire'' (1977), which will all be re-released in coming months, and ''Discreet Charm,'' which is playing at Lincoln Plaza Cinemas in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>''He was so generous, so nice, a truly beautiful human being,'' said Mr. Silberman of the man whose most famous image, from the 1929 ''Andalusian Dog,'' graphically depicts a straight razor slicing an eyeball. ''He was one way in life and another way up here,'' Mr. Silberman added, tapping his forehead.</p>
        <p>For all of the anarchic energy of his films, Bunuel led an orderly life and made his movies the same way. ''He gave me the scripts like a child turning in his homework, as if he were afraid of what I was going to say,'' Mr. Silberman said. ''He would only shoot exactly what was in the script. He was absolutely prepared. With me he made everything in about 48 days. It took him one week to edit. And when the first cut was done, the picture was finished.''</p>
        <p>Building an Incubator</p>
        <p>Another approach to producing is being developed at Madstone Films on lower Fifth Avenue. The company's founders -- Tom Gruenberg, a 25-year veteran of the film industry, and Chip Seelig, a partner in Goldman Sachs -- say they hope to reinvent the entire process. ''The idea we came up with,'' Mr. Seelig said, ''was to take first-time directors, most likely young, and try to put them in a very supportive, nurturing environment and see what comes out of that process.''</p>
        <p>As a result 15 novice filmmakers will be put under two-year contracts with annual salaries of $50,000, a benefits package and a retirement plan. The resident filmmakers are expected to act as creative catalysts for one another.</p>
        <p>''You go back to the halcyon days of the 70's, with Spielberg and Lucas and Coppola and Scorsese,'' Mr. Gruenberg said. ''They would sit and talk about film for 10 or 12 hours a day. We felt that if we could harness creative filmmakers and put them into an environment where they could work and talk, and take away the financial problems, we could raise the bar creatively.''</p>
        <p>To encourage group consultation, Madstone is offering a financial incentive. ''In the two years you are working at Madstone, you have a percentage of every film that we make,'' said Mr. Seelig, so that at the end of the process the filmmakers will all be sharing in one another's success.</p>
        <p>The company's new offices, at 85 Fifth Avenue, are being designed to foster cooperation. ''We're trying to set architecturally a very collaborative environment,'' said Eva Kolodner, an independent producer (''Boys Don't Cry'') who has been brought aboard as head of feature development and production. ''The idea is that I can go write my script by myself, but at the end of the afternoon I can sit down and sigh: 'I'm having trouble with this dialogue. Does anybody have any thoughts?' ''</p>
        <p>Central to the concept is the relatively inexpensive digital video equipment that has recently been developed. ''It's a digital operation from start to finish,'' Mr. Gruenberg emphasized. ''We're going to shoot digitally, and retrofit 50 theaters across the country, and fill those theaters with digital content that we make or acquire.''</p>
        <p>Madstone's business plan calls for films budgeted at $500,000 to $1.5 million, a typical range for independent features.</p>
        <p>''People ask us, 'Why digital?' '' Ms. Kolodner said. ''You could make a 35-millimeter feature for that budget. But it's a new art form.''</p>
        <p>She continued: ''People have a kind of flexibility in digital that doesn't exist anymore in 35-millimeter, where you are constrained by your budget. With digital you can shoot more, you can take more chances, you can push the boundaries a little bit more.''</p>
        <p>And where are these bright young talents to be found? ''Our first kind of outreach is to film schools and film festivals,'' Ms. Kolodner said. ''But if people want to come to us, the real place to go is our Web site, www.madstonefilms.com.''</p>
        <p>''But we're not a dot-com,'' Mr. Seelig said, with the emphasis of a newly wary Wall Streeter. ''We just happen to have an Internet address.''</p>
        <p>In Keaton's Footsteps</p>
        <p>An original piece of film scholarship has just been published by The Santa Monica Press. In ''Silent Echoes: Discovering Early Hollywood Through the Films of Buster Keaton,'' the author, John Bergstrom, has gone over the major Keaton shorts and features with a magnifying glass, identifying the original locations through the tiniest of clues and presenting side-by-side-by-side comparisons of how the various buildings, intersections, alleyways and landscapes appear on film, in period photographs and today.</p>
        <p>The results are a sort of Proustian collage of time and memory, biography and history, urban growth and artistic expression. Mr. Bergstrom has traced almost every step of the celebrated chase in ''Cops'' (1922) through downtown Los Angeles. And he identifies the locations Keaton used during the Manhattan production of ''The Cameraman'' (1928). He also gives precise directions to the site in Culp Creek Canyon in Oregon, where in 1927 Keaton staged the train wreck in ''The General,'' though Mr. Bergstrom warns, ''The brambles are sharp, the rocks are slippery, and the hike requires passing along private property.''</p>
