        <p>The death of a 10-year-old Brooklyn boy in February has been ruled a homicide, according to a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office, who said the child died of starvation and dehydration.</p>
        <p>The boy, David Jones, one of triplets, lived in a well-maintained apartment building in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, with his parents. His mother, Renee C. Jones, had called the police on Feb. 17, saying that her son felt ill and was  unconscious, a police official said.</p>

        <p>The death of a 10-year-old Brooklyn boy in February has been ruled a homicide, according to a spokeswoman for the medical examiner's office, who said the child died of starvation and dehydration.</p>
        <p>The boy, David Jones, one of triplets, lived in a well-maintained apartment building in Carroll Gardens, Brooklyn, with his parents. His mother, Renee C. Jones, had called the police on Feb. 17, saying that her son felt ill and was  unconscious, a police official said.</p>
        <p>The boy was taken to Long Island College Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival, possibly from a viral infection, police officials said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The medical examiner began investigating the cause of death, and the other children were taken to the hospital and examined for signs of abuse, but none were found and they were returned to the family, said a police spokesman, Detective John Giammarino.</p>
        <p>But on Monday, the death was ruled a homicide caused by ''starvation and dehydration,'' said the medical examiner's spokeswoman, Ellen Borakove.</p>
        <p>She did not say why it had taken almost three months to determine the cause of death, and could not say what the boy's height and weight had been when he died.</p>
        <p>The boy's siblings have since been removed from their home by the city's Department of Child Welfare, Detective Giammarino said.</p>
        <p>Last night, Ms. Jones -- who said she had not yet been officially notified that her son's death had been classified as a homicide -- politely told a reporter who rang the doorbell at her apartment at 63 Tiffany Place that the determination was ''ridiculous.''</p>
        <p>Standing in the doorway of her first-floor  apartment, she said: ''Classifying it as a homicide? To me, this is ridiculous,'' adding, ''It's totally unjustified.''</p>
        <p>She denied that her son had been starved or malnourished, and said that there had been no previous investigations or allegations of abuse involving him.</p>
        <p>She said that she would tell ''the whole story'' once her lawyer gave her permission.</p>
        <p>Neighbors at their apartment building said that the Jones family seemed friendly.</p>
        <p>''They looked like a happy family,'' said Alfredo Campos, the building's superintendent.  ''I used to see all of them, every day, going to play in the park.''</p>
        <p>Other neighbors said they believed that the boy had died from some kind of infection. ''I heard about it, but thought it was some kind of food poisoning,'' said Lynn Bell, who lives in the apartment above.</p>
