        <p>The United States had to take a pass when offered a choice exhibition space at the great Paris show of modern design in 1925, the ''Exposition des Arts Decoratifs et Industriels Modernes.'' Why? Herbert Hoover, at the time secretary of commerce, had consulted V.I.P.'s in the art, educational and business worlds, who advised that there was no modern design in America.</p>
        <p>Sadly, with a few exceptions, it was true. European designers and manufacturers, particularly the French, were alive to the merchandising potential of design trends, like Art Deco. (Although it took its name from the Paris exposition, by 1925 Art Deco had already peaked in Europe.)</p>
        <p>But Americans were still stuck in the worn groove of period furniture and decor. There was no serious contemporary movement in the decorative arts and, except for the tradition-busting skyscrapers going up in big cities, the public was hardly aware that such a thing as modern design could exist.</p>
        <p>The Paris exhibition changed all that, awakening -- as did the Armory show of 1913 for modern art -- a new American interest in matters of design. The Metropolitan Museum  bought seven important pieces from the Art Deco-oriented show, including a cabinet by Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann, then the high priest of French decoration. What's more, the next year the Met played host to a traveling exhibition of works by  craftsman-designer stars of the Paris extravaganza. The display caught on, articles appeared and trend-spotters in this country took notice. By the 1930's, manufacturers and designers were working together to stimulate the economy.</p>
        <p>The Met, which happily seems to have stepped up its interest in design shows, has chosen that exposition year of 1925 as the kickoff for two new ones. ''American Modern, 1925-1940: Design for a New Age'' is bracketed between the Paris exposition and the New York World's Fair of 1939-40. A smaller show, ''A Century of Design, Part II, 1925-1950,'' the second in a four-part series surveying the 20th century, concentrates on European work. (Part I, covering the first quarter of the century, ran from last December through March.)</p>
        <p>''American Modern,'' a collaboration between the Met and the American Federation of Arts organized by J. Stewart Johnson, consultant for design and architecture in the Met's department of modern art, is the larger and more interesting, not just by virtue of its size.</p>
        <p>Drawn from the Met's collection and from a collection promised to the museum by John C. Waddell, ''American Modern'' displays more than 150 objects: furniture, appliances, clocks, radios, cameras, textiles, tableware, book covers, posters, a vacuum cleaner, parts of a snappy blue-and-chrome dining room and even a shiny, skyscraperish step-on scale that told your weight and fortune for a penny. If much of it is familiar stuff, it wears well. The designers include such stellar names as Norman Bel Geddes, Donald Deskey, Henry Dreyfuss, Paul Frankl, Ilonka Karasz, Raymond Loewy, Isamu Noguchi, Eliel Saarinen, Charles Sheeler, Walter Dorwin Teague and Russel Wright.</p>
        <p>At first, Art Deco -- a conservative but catchy fusion of earlier neo-classical styles like Louis XVI and Empire laced with Cubism, Futurism and late Art Nouveau -- was all the rage. Sumptuous materials were its hallmark, like the inlaid armoire of 1926 done for the New York furniture store W &amp; J Sloane by an unknown designer. Made of mahogany, satinwood and ebony, with a kitschy little inlaid design on its veneer front, it epitomized the luxury appeal of Art Deco, not meant for a mass market.</p>
        <p>But the French-fostered movement, with its curvilinear forms and cushy materials, was soon supplemented by the austere geometrics of the Bauhaus, the German design school initially led by Walter Gropius. Of real intellectual substance as against the derivative, backward-looking Art Deco, Bauhaus design was dedicated to producing functional, well-made, affordable items for a broad public through cooperation with manufacturers and the use of practical materials. When the school was closed by the Nazis in 1933, many of its teachers, including Gropius, came to America, where their ideas found a receptive audience.</p>
        <p>In this country, Art Deco became the term for design influenced by the age of skyscrapers and machines. It was America's first popular modern style, although the terms Art Moderne or Streamlined Moderne are preferred by many in the decorative arts. And a new tastemaker, the industrial designer, emerged.</p>
        <p>Among the more prolific of them were Teague, Bel Geddes and Dreyfuss. Teague (1883-1960), one of the first industrial designers, did the Ford Motor Company and the National Cash Register pavilions for the '39 World's Fair. He is represented in the show by no fewer than 18 items, among them the ''Bluebird'' radio (1934) for the Sparton Company. Of blue mirror glass, the radio face is horizontally trisected by chrome-plated bars that cross two central circles surrounding the dial.</p>
        <p>Bel Geddes (1893-1958), originally a designer of productions for the theater, the opera and films, later did streamlined cars for Chrysler and Plymouth and the Futurama Pavilion for the '39 World's Fair. In 1940 he designed what has become the show's icon: the cheerful little ''Patriot'' radio for Emerson, a plastic portable whose grille is striped in red and white like the bars of an American flag. No less celebrated a design brain was Dreyfuss (1904-1972), a pioneer in the field of ergonomics, who redid the 20th-Century Limited train for the New York Central Railroad and produced such iconic mass-manufactured items as the thermos bottle (1937), which appears in the show.</p>
        <p>The skyscraper, a native American product whose soaring height and bold architecture seemed to speak optimistically of the future, was a design inspiration, affecting everything from furniture to lamps to cocktail shakers. Among the show's most engaging objects are the ''skyscraper'' desk and bookcase, designed around 1927 by the Viennese-born Paul Frankl (1887-1958) in wood, Formica and Bakelite, an early plastic. Their geometric modules were staggered and set back, like the real thing.</p>
        <p>Streamlining, with its rounded, rocket-shaped forms that symbolized speed, was yet another American contribution to the design field, although its roots could probably be traced to Italian Futurism of an earlier date. From trains, cars and planes, streamlining spread to ordinary household objects, like desk lamps, clocks, radios and tableware. Its effect can be seen on such disparate items in the show as the ''Radio Nurse'' (1937), done by the sculptor Isamu Noguchi for the Zenith Radio Corporation, a sleek, helmetlike contraption of black Bakelite meant for monitoring sounds in another room, and the ''Airline'' armchair (circa 1934) by the German-born Karl Emanuel Martin Weber (1889-1963), whose loungey seat and back of Naugahyde are counterpoint to an aerodynamic-looking wood frame.</p>
        <p>It would be nice to see a Hupmobile designed by Loewy (1893-1986) instead of just the dinky little chrome-plated hood ornament he designed for the car, or Dreyfuss's 20th-Century Limited in the flesh, so to speak. But even at the Met, space limitations prevail, and besides neither object is in its collection.</p>
        <p>Because it is a collection show, ''American Modern'' does not have the sharp point of view of ''Packaging the New: Design and the American Consumer,'' mounted in 1994 by the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, Smithsonian Institution. Covering 50 years of the 20th century, that show presented stylistic change as the driving force behind design, manufacturing and consumerism.</p>
        <p>But why carp? The attractive, thematically arranged displays and lucid juxtapositions of the Met's show are a visual feast and enticingly evoke the spirit of the age.</p>
        <p>''A Century of Design, Part II, 1925-1950,'' also organized by Mr. Johnson, by contrast with the first installment of this four-part series,  seems a very mixed bag, stocked with the expected, unexciting and just plain ugly.</p>
        <p>Focusing on Europe while covering virtually the same time frame as ''American Modern,'' it presents 50 objects from the Met's collection by such talents as Alvar Aalto, Marcel Breuer, Jean Dunand, Charles Eames, Eileen Gray, Rene Jules Lalique, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, Joan Miro, Emile-Jacques Ruhlmann, Gerrit Rietveld and Eva Zeisel, along with lesser lights.</p>
        <p>Among the Art Deco exhibits looms Ruhlmann's overfussy sideboard (circa 1922) of macassar ebony tricked out with ivory and silver bronze. Two quieter but also unappealing Art Deco objects are cutesy etched glass vessels by the Swedish designer Edward Hald (1883-1980), dated 1926 and 1927.</p>
        <p>The show improves with the geometric Bauhaus influence, seen in a pair of square hanging lamps (circa 1935) whose sides are surfaced like graters by the British designer Eileen Gray (1879-1976). Not to be scanted either is the wonderfully architectural inkwell (1929-30) in bright orange earthenware by Eva Zeisel (born in Hungary in 1906) that looks like a skyscraper lying on its side. Other good things include a wonderful scale drawing for the Daimler-Benz sport convertible No. 3384 (circa 1933) by Wilhelm Reuter, a German.</p>
        <p>Chairs are rife, most of them fairly familiar. They include Breuer's ''Wassily'' armchair (1925), of tubular steel and canvas upholstery; Mies van der Rohe's ''MR'' model (1927), with a cantilevered seat and back of black caning set in a chrome-plated steel frame; and Aalto's ''39'' chaise longue (1936-37), a long, body-loving chair whose webbed seat is also cantilvered, on a simple bentwood frame.</p>
        <p>As mentioned, the show has its quota of nontreasures. The biggest such surprise is an earthenware vase (1942) by Joan Miro, whose conventional urn shape is inflected by a painted abstract motif or two. What it's doing here is hard to figure out.</p>
        <p>''American Modern, 1925-1940: Design for a New Age'' remains at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212) 535-7710, through Jan. 7. ''A Century of Design, Part II: 1925-1950'' is at the museum through Oct. 29.</p>
