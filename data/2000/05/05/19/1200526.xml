        <p>On the face of it, the work of the Japanese photographers Masao Yamamoto, Miyako Ishiuchi and Yukio Oyama would seem to have little in common.</p>
        <p>Since the late 1980's, Mr. Yamamoto, 42, has been adding small, exquisitely minimalist images of whatever catches his fancy to his ever-expanding ''Box of Ku'' series.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ishiuchi, born a few years after World War II, favors the oversize grainy prints and gritty subject matter -- scarred bodies and abandoned buildings in her work of the last decade or so -- that characterize the pictures of many photographers in the late 1960's and 70's who preferred the ''are-bure,'' or grainy-blurry. In essence, this movement was a powerful rejection of then-prevailing photographic conventions.</p>
        <p>Mr. Oyama, 37, a graduate of the Japan Photographic Academy in Tokyo, where he now teaches, focuses on the formalist face of nature, a formalism that the ''are-bure'' school had rejected earlier.</p>
        <p>As varied as their photographic styles are, all three share a passion for recording the traces left by time. ''Vestiges'' is the aptly titled exhibition of their work at Sepia International Inc. in Chelsea.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ishiuchi began to take close-ups of the bodies of the very old in the early 1990's.  Time is invisible, Ms. Ishiuchi said about that series, but it becomes visible in the human body as it ages. As the body ages, few if any escape some kind of scarring, and for Ms. Ishiuchi photographing scars was the logical next step. Tangible reminders of past illnesses or accidents, scars are like old photographs, she is fond of saying. In her monumental grainy close-ups in the exhibition, scars -- signs of the body's fragility -- are paradoxically transformed into marks of endurance and strength.</p>
        <p>Also on exhibition are Ms. Ishiuchi's late-1980's studies of time's ravages in the form of seriously peeling paint. The pictures, part of her ''Bay Side Courts'' series, are oddly painful to look at. Almost palpably, creepily textured, they are not about the kind of abstract beauty that Aaron Siskind found in peeling paint. Instead, they attest to the cruel results of neglect over time. But even here Ms. Ishiuchi sees some redemption. In ''Bay Side Courts No. 9,'' the beauty is in the unexpected glow of sunlight filtering through the trees outside the windows high above a badly peeling entrance.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Oyama's section of ''Vestiges,'' time leaves its marks in much subtler ways. A swing, its wooden seat at precise right angles to its two long metal chains, a few tufts of tall grass below the seat, evokes the magic of childhood. In the context of the exhibition, Mr. Oyama's beautifully layered study of incoming tides -- big swirls of foam and water in the foreground, a sliver of crashing white waves beyond, and still, dark waters in the horizon -- is a gentle reminder of the adage ''Time and tide wait for no man.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Oyama also sees scars left by time. Melting snow assumes mysterious, undulating dark forms. ''Path, Four-VII'' (1997) shows a log lying in the snow like a scar, its weight cutting an indentation on one side and producing a row of raised snow on the other.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Yamamoto has been tackling the subject of time's traces -- and memory -- in his signature subversive fashion. Clearly the highlight of the exhibition, his ''Box of Ku,'' is at once enigmatic, captivating, forthright and lyrical. (Ku, meaning emptiness in Japanese, is a classic Zen concept.) The pictures show how wondrous black-and-white photography can be and are a refreshing throwback to a time when photographs were not treated as precious commodities.</p>
        <p>These days, with the ''object quality'' of vintage prints prized by collectors, anyone handling said prints must wear cotton gloves. But Mr. Yamamoto almost devilishly accentuates the object quality of his small prints by giving them a worn look. Often the edges are frayed. Some are creased. Others are oddly shaped, as if they were haphazardly cut to size.</p>
        <p>He shows his prints without frames, taped to the wall, either singly or in a cascading grouping on the walls. He groups other prints within frames or in an accordion rice-paper album. He encourages viewers to pick up his accordion album and look at its images one by one or in whatever grouping they like as the pages are laid out along a long table. And he definitely wants viewers to draw up an old wooden chair and rummage through a large pile of his prints spilling out of an open old leather case placed on top of a beat-up old side table. Mr. Yamamoto calls this box of loose pictures his dictionary.</p>
        <p>Like his accordion album, the prints in the exhibition can be seen from many levels. Viewers can read his groupings as poems or stories or come up with their own poems or stories, drawing on the memories or experiences these images conjure up.</p>
        <p>Anyone who looks closely at Mr. Yamamoto's minuscule prints can see that he is a superb photographer. And they seem particularly marvelous as individual prints. Among vignettes of nature at its loveliest are a dreamy waterfall and a glowing lotus leaf against an inky background. Spare still lifes include a bloom or two in a plain glass. Birds are shown alone or in flight, or just standing still in a group, seemingly raising a chorus to the sky. In an urban slice of life, a spill trails down some steps. Recording the intersection of man and nature, the photographer shows two white ladders perched along the sides of mountains; he contrasts a hibiscus in bloom with a burst of fireworks in the sky, and (in one of the few color shots) he catches puffs of clouds against the blue sky that look as if they were growing out of a crooked pole.</p>
        <p>With the pace of 21st-century life reduced to a never-ending rush from one thing to another, Mr. Yamamoto's ''Box of Ku'' affords a most delightful chance to stop and take momentary stock of time's passage and to look once more at the world with fresh new eyes.</p>
        <p>''Vestiges'' is at Sepia International Inc., 148 West 24th Street, 11th floor, Chelsea, (212) 645-9444, through June 17. ''A Box of Ku,'' published by Nazraeli Press, and ''Miyako Ishiuchi: Time Textured in Monochrome,'' published by the National Museum of Modern Art, Tokyo, are available at the gallery.</p>
