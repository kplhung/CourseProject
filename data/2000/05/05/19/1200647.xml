        <p>The Pentagon announced today that a decisive test of a national missile-defense system had again been delayed, increasing pressure on the project's managers to meet the Clinton administration's timetable for deciding whether to deploy the system.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon's Ballistic Missile Defense Organization had planned to conduct the test on June 26, but late last month the project's managers discovered a wiring problem in the interceptor missiles to be tested, officials said. Because of required repairs, the scheduled test has now been pushed back at least another week and perhaps longer, officials said.</p>
        <p>The missile office has still not scheduled a new date for the test, but the Pentagon's spokesman, Kenneth H. Bacon, said today that the delay ''should not have any impact whatsoever'' on the Clinton administration's timetable for making a decision on whether to deploy later this year.</p>
        <p>The test has already suffered another delay, a longer one that pushed the timing of Mr. Clinton's decision into the heart of this year's presidential campaign. The administration's plans to proceed with testing the system and deciding on the deployment of it has provoked a highly partisan debate at home and a diplomatic furor abroad.</p>
        <p>With a decision nearing, the administration's plans have become increasingly unsettling to the Russians and the Chinese, who view it as a threat to their own strategic nuclear deterrence, as well as some allies who fear it could upset decades of arms-control negotiations.</p>
        <p>President Clinton is scheduled to meet next month with Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, to discuss amending the Antiballistic Missile Treaty of 1973 to allow the construction of a limited national missile defense. Mr. Clinton's national security adviser, Samuel R. Berger, met with Mr. Putin in Moscow today, and while the meeting was described as friendly, Mr. Berger evidently made little progress in overcoming Russia's opposition to the system.</p>
        <p>If the Pentagon proceeds with the test -- the fourth and final one the military has planned before Mr. Clinton is to make his decision -- an interceptor missile will be launched from Kwajalein Atoll in the Marshall Islands toward an intercontinental ballistic missile fired from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California.</p>
        <p>In the last test in January, the first of a fully integrated system of missiles, radars and sensors, the interceptor approached the incoming missile but failed to hit it.</p>
        <p>The latest delay, has created concern among Pentagon officials. Under an agreement with the Marshall Islands to protect fishermen, the Pentagon must suspend testing for a month beginning July 12. Thus the window for testing in July has narrowed considerably.</p>
        <p>Further delays could postpone the test until August, making it unlikely that Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen would have time to review the test data, confer with the military and make a recommendation to Mr. Clinton before the fall.</p>
        <p>The final test has already faced considerable delays, which the project's managers said they needed to correct a problem with the infrared sensors that caused the interceptor to miss its target during January's test.</p>
        <p>The Pentagon and the administration have come under bipartisan pressure to slow down what officials acknowledge is a compressed testing schedule. Members of both parties have said the timetable is based on political rather than technological considerations, and called for delaying the decision. But Mr. Bacon reiterated today that Mr. Cohen was determined to make a recommendation to Mr. Clinton according to schedule.</p>
        <p>Lt. Col. Richard Lehner of the Air Force, a spokesman for the missile organization, said the problem with the latest interceptor was discovered on April 30 during a test at Lockheed Martin's plant in Sunnyvale, Calif. The problem did not involve the interceptor missile itself, but rather a transmitter used to monitor the test.</p>
        <p>Raytheon, which is building the interceptor's warhead, repaired the problem at its plant in Tucson. Once the warhead is reattached to its booster rocket, it will be flown to Kwajalein for final test preparations.</p>
        <p>''Hopefully, we'll get the test done before the range closes,'' Colonel Lehner said.</p>
        <p>It was unclear why officials disclosed the problem nearly three weeks after it was discovered. Mr. Bacon said the project's managers did not consider it a serious setback.</p>
