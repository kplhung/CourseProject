        <p>Deitch Projects  18 Wooster Street, near Grand Street  SoHo  Through May 27</p>
        <p>The 15 paintings in Ghada Amer's third solo show in New York excel at what might be called politically correct decorativeness. Each features rows of small, repeating images of provocatively posed women, based on ones lifted from pornographic magazines. These motifs have been meticulously stitched (by hand) over casually applied drips and smears of thin color -- in other words, a gloss of formalist painting styles from Abstract Expressionism forward.</p>
        <p>The contrasting techniques can have a certain visual snap. As with Warhol's silk-screen paintings, the precision and repetition of the appropriated imagery enlivens the lackadaisical color washes. Great care has been taken with color contrasts, and the way these are used varies impressively from painting to painting.</p>

        <p>The 15 paintings in Ghada Amer's third solo show in New York excel at what might be called politically correct decorativeness. Each features rows of small, repeating images of provocatively posed women, based on ones lifted from pornographic magazines. These motifs have been meticulously stitched (by hand) over casually applied drips and smears of thin color -- in other words, a gloss of formalist painting styles from Abstract Expressionism forward.</p>
        <p>The contrasting techniques can have a certain visual snap. As with Warhol's silk-screen paintings, the precision and repetition of the appropriated imagery enlivens the lackadaisical color washes. Great care has been taken with color contrasts, and the way these are used varies impressively from painting to painting.</p>
        <p>The political purpose is also clear. Notions of female pleasure and oppression, of a range of ''women's work'' (from prostitution to sewing), are pitted against modern painting, a traditionally male, more culturally valued form of labor and pleasure. It may almost be a form of revenge that the hundreds of threads criss-crossing the paintings' surfaces create cascades of spidery lines that put the sloppy painting to shame. But political correctness in any form has its limits. For one thing, the paintings look bland and generic from a distance. They are livelier up close, but it can be tiring to make out the exact nature of the imagery.</p>
        <p>The hard-won legibility may be part of Ms. Amer's program. The paintings are clearly labor-intensive to make; why shouldn't they be work to look at? the argument might run. And why shouldn't each viewer find out how much effort he or she will make for a little sexual titillation? All this is interesting enough to think about, but the points don't seem any less dry or didactic for being conveyed in visual terms.  Ms. Amer gets a lot out of a little, but it is still not enough. The good thing about this show is that it indicates an interest in more, which makes one curious about what will happen next.</p>
