        <p>In meticulous and often personal detail, federal prosecutors fleshed out their tax fraud case today against Albert J. Pirro Jr., summoning a parade of contractors and employees who said they had performed chores for Mr. Pirro and his family but had been paid by his companies.</p>
        <p>The witnesses rounded out the first full day of testimony in the trial, one of the most anticipated in Westchester in many years. The trial centers on the government's contention that Mr. Pirro, a prominent and politically connected real estate lawyer, and his brother Anthony G. Pirro conspired to deduct $1 million in personal expenses as business write-offs.</p>

        <p>In meticulous and often personal detail, federal prosecutors fleshed out their tax fraud case today against Albert J. Pirro Jr., summoning a parade of contractors and employees who said they had performed chores for Mr. Pirro and his family but had been paid by his companies.</p>
        <p>The witnesses rounded out the first full day of testimony in the trial, one of the most anticipated in Westchester in many years. The trial centers on the government's contention that Mr. Pirro, a prominent and politically connected real estate lawyer, and his brother Anthony G. Pirro conspired to deduct $1 million in personal expenses as business write-offs.</p>
        <p>For the most part, today's witnesses -- including two chauffeurs, a plumbing contractor and a stonemason -- seemed partial to the Pirro family. Some winked at Albert Pirro; some exchanged greetings with his wife, Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney.</p>
        <p>Some testified that the lawyers they had hired for this trial had been recommended by Mr. Pirro, and that he was paying their legal fees.</p>
        <p>But under questioning by prosecutors, some of Mr. Pirro's former employees said that while they were paid for work that was supposed to be related to his businesses, they spent much of their time running personal errands for the Pirros or doing work on their homes.</p>
        <p>One chauffeur, John Baumeister, testified that he had received checks from Mr. Pirro's companies for tasks like picking up the family's dry cleaning and taking the family's pets to the veterinarian. One time, he said, he traveled to West Palm Beach and used a corporate credit card from Mr. Pirro's law firm to buy $6,000 worth of items for the family's vacation home in Florida.</p>
        <p>But on cross-examination, Mr. Baumeister agreed with Gustave H. Newman, a defense lawyer, that Mr. Pirro was a constant blur of activity, and that the home in Florida was an office necessary for entertaining clients -- implying that any related expenses were business deductions.</p>
