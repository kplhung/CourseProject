        <p>Ricky Ledee went to sleep in a Cleveland hotel last night, hoping that his dreams about baseball would not recur. The dreams are not really nightmares since Ledee usually smacks hits in them, but they still unnerve him because they prevent him from relaxing for a few hours.</p>
        <p>Ledee is desperately trying to prove to the Yankees, especially the principal owner, George Steinbrenner, that he can be a productive left fielder for a team trying to win its third straight World Series title. He has heard Steinbrenner's criticism and the rumors about possibly being replaced, so even in his sleep Ledee's mind dwells on that next elusive hit.</p>

        <p>Ricky Ledee went to sleep in a Cleveland hotel last night, hoping that his dreams about baseball would not recur. The dreams are not really nightmares since Ledee usually smacks hits in them, but they still unnerve him because they prevent him from relaxing for a few hours.</p>
        <p>Ledee is desperately trying to prove to the Yankees, especially the principal owner, George Steinbrenner, that he can be a productive left fielder for a team trying to win its third straight World Series title. He has heard Steinbrenner's criticism and the rumors about possibly being replaced, so even in his sleep Ledee's mind dwells on that next elusive hit.</p>
        <p>''I tell everyone that I'm not pressing and I'm not thinking about it, but I am,'' Ledee said, bowing his head like a 10-year-old caught in a lie. ''I can't help it. I can't get away from it. It's not like I'm panicking and there's all this pressure on me, but I think about it all the time.''</p>
        <p>Ledee will not start against the left-hander Chuck Finley tonight, and Derek Jeter will obviously not play because he is on his way to Tampa, Fla., for treatment on his strained left abdominal muscle and will probably be placed on the disabled list as early as today. Manager Joe Torre might use the same revised lineup that helped the Yankees coast to a 9-4 victory over the White Sox and end a five-game losing streak on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Bernie Williams shifted from the cleanup position to the second spot and clubbed his eighth career grand slam and a bases-empty homer, and Shane Spencer manned the fourth spot and had three hits. With Williams providing protection in back of him, Chuck Knoblauch, the leadoff hitter, energized the offense by getting two hits and scoring two runs.</p>
        <p>So, today will be one more day off the calendar for Ledee, 26, who knows his time for emerging with the Yankees is dwindling. Steinbrenner has hinted about moves the Yankees refrained from making, alluding in particular to their decision not to acquire Jim Edmonds. The Yankees did not want to include Alfonso Soriano and Ramiro Mendoza in a deal with Anaheim for Edmonds, feeling that Ledee would be a capable left fielder for them.</p>
        <p>Now, seven weeks into the season, Edmonds, who was traded to St. Louis, is one of the most fruitful hitters in the National League with a .392 average and 13 homers going into last night. Ledee is batting .211 with 1 homer. Steinbrenner has probably mentioned Edmonds's surge to General Manager Brian Cashman every other hour and Ledee is aware that Steinbrenner has cited him as one of the culprits responsible for New York's lethargic offense.</p>
        <p>''What he said, it got my attention,'' Ledee said, his eyes widening. ''It doesn't bother me, but I don't understand why you would pick out one person and do something like that. That's another thing we have to deal with here.''</p>
        <p>Steinbrenner questioned whether Ledee, who had 6 hits in 10 at-bats in the 1998 World Series, had the mental toughness to be a Yankee. Ledee, who was careful about engaging in a verbal skirmish he could only lose, said, ''I know I can do it here.''</p>
        <p>After belting a team-best seven homers during spring training, Ledee said he has been too anxious since then. He stood in front of his locker with a bat and showed how he has been leaning across the plate to swing at too many outside pitches, leaving himself off balance and limiting his power. Ledee showed how his swing would be more compact and powerful if he would wait for pitches that are inside or over the middle.</p>
        <p>''I want to be aggressive, but I can't be stupid,'' said Ledee, who is 0 for his last 14. ''I've got to wait for my pitches instead of letting guys get me out on their pitches.''</p>
        <p>The only time Ledee forgets his slump is when he sees Ricky Jr., his 2-year-old son. The boy was waiting for him to return from Detroit last Sunday night and shouted ''Poppy! Poppy!'' when he strolled through the door. Inevitably, little Ricky says ''Rock! Rock!'' to Ledee, meaning he's about to imitate the professional wrestler known as The Rock and dive on his father's chest. Inevitably, the boy falls asleep and Ledee resumes his obsession with hitting.</p>
        <p>''It's hard because I want to do it so bad,'' Ledee said. ''I woke up twice the other day dreaming about hitting.''</p>
        <p>Ledee knows that Steinbrenner, who was at Yankee Stadium this week, is watching him closely. Ledee talks so softly that it sometimes seems as if he is whispering, but he would offer a direct message to Steinbrenner if he had the chance.</p>
        <p>''I would tell him to give me a little more time and believe in me,'' Ledee said. ''I know he's got to do what he's got to do, but give me some more time. I still believe in myself.''</p>
