        <p>Despite his trainer's best efforts, all eyes fell on Fusaichi Pegasus today as the Kentucky Derby winner stretched his legs at Pimlico Race Course and cantered on the track in his first exercise for Saturday's Preakness Stakes. The trainer, Neil Drysdale, shielding his star right up to the starting gate, even said he would saddle Fusaichi Pegasus in the inside paddock before the race to avoid the crowd in the outside saddling ring.</p>
        <p>Fusaichi Pegasus has had a history of balky and unpredictable behavior, although he comported himself with professional calm in the Derby. Still, Drysdale was taking no chances. He elected to avoid the Preakness Barn behind the grandstand where his horse's seven rivals are stabled, and instead chose to keep him in Barn 7, across the track on the backstretch.</p>

        <p>Despite his trainer's best efforts, all eyes fell on Fusaichi Pegasus today as the Kentucky Derby winner stretched his legs at Pimlico Race Course and cantered on the track in his first exercise for Saturday's Preakness Stakes. The trainer, Neil Drysdale, shielding his star right up to the starting gate, even said he would saddle Fusaichi Pegasus in the inside paddock before the race to avoid the crowd in the outside saddling ring.</p>
        <p>Fusaichi Pegasus has had a history of balky and unpredictable behavior, although he comported himself with professional calm in the Derby. Still, Drysdale was taking no chances. He elected to avoid the Preakness Barn behind the grandstand where his horse's seven rivals are stabled, and instead chose to keep him in Barn 7, across the track on the backstretch.</p>
        <p>Drysdale, a cultivated Englishman and a man of few words, reported that he had studied tapes of the Derby extensively and agreed that Pegasus ''did have a very clean trip.'' When he was asked if he was concerned that the other jockeys would try to make things more difficult for his horse, he replied: ''No.'' Why? ''Because he's got an outside post.''</p>
        <p>Fusaichi Pegasus drew the No. 7 post in a field of eight, and was made the 3-5 favorite. His trainer suggested that he should be closer to the lead than in the Derby, where he was 15th rounding the first turn. But was he confident?</p>
        <p>''I'm never confident,'' Drysdale replied. ''I might be optimistic, but not confident.''</p>
        <p>Impeachment Is Last to Arrive</p>
        <p>Impeachment, the last horse to arrive at Pimlico for the Preakness, made it in at 9:15 this morning after a van trip from Belmont Park in New York that started at 4:30 a.m.</p>
        <p>The colt, third in the Arkansas Derby and third in the Kentucky Derby, had an uneventful trip. His trainer, Todd Pletcher, who started four horses in the Kentucky Derby, arrived this afternoon from Ocala, Fla., to tend his one horse in this race.</p>
        <p>Asmussen Brothers Team Up</p>
        <p>One new story line involves Snuck In, second in the Arkansas Derby, who is trained by Steve Asmussen and will be ridden by the trainer's brother, Cash Asmussen, a top jockey in Europe for years.</p>
        <p>''Cash will be flying in from France later today,'' Steve said this morning. ''This will be my first starter in a Triple Crown race, and it's great my brother can ride him. He rode one of my first winners when I started training about 12 years ago.''</p>
