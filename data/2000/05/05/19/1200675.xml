        <p>Director Louis J.

        <p>Mr. Freeh's warning, they said, was in a memorandum that the Federal Bureau of Investigation provided this week to Senate investigators who are reviewing the Justice Department's investigation of campaign fund-raising improprieties by Democrats in the 1996 campaign.</p>

        <p>Director Louis J. Freeh of the F.B.I. warned in 1996 that Attorney General Janet Reno and one of her top deputies should remove themselves from an investigation into Democratic fund-raising after the aide was quoted as saying that Ms. Reno could lose her job if the inquiry proceeded, government officials said today.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeh's warning, they said, was in a memorandum that the Federal Bureau of Investigation provided this week to Senate investigators who are reviewing the Justice Department's investigation of campaign fund-raising improprieties by Democrats in the 1996 campaign.</p>
        <p>The memorandum could cast new light on Ms. Reno's early decision making in the investigation and her later decision to turn aside the advice of Mr. Freeh and her own chief campaign finance prosecutor and close an investigation into Vice President Al Gore. That decision greatly eased Mr. Gore's burden as he prepared to open his bid for the White House, but it embroiled Ms. Reno in harsh criticism that she was seeking to protect her superiors. She has insisted that her decision not to seek an independent counsel in the case was motivated by a lack of evidence, not by any sort of political pressure.</p>
        <p>The memorandum is additional evidence of the deep, longstanding split between Mr. Freeh and Ms. Reno, and its existence became known as Ms. Reno received an internal report this week that faulted both the Justice Department and the F.B.I. for failures to cooperate in the investigation of the nuclear scientist Wen Ho Lee. Officials said the report was especially tough on the bureau.</p>
        <p>According to the Dec. 9, 1996, memorandum on the campaign fund-raising investigation, Mr. Freeh recounted remarks attributed to Lee Radek, the Justice Department's chief of public integrity, in which Mr. Radek was said to have claimed that he was under considerable pressure to scrap the investigation because Ms. Reno's job ''might hang in the balance,'' the officials said.</p>
        <p>Administration officials had been widely quoted at the time as suggesting that Ms. Reno might be asked to step aside and allow the appointment of a new attorney general in President Clinton's second term. The existence of the memorandum was first reported by The Associated Press.</p>
        <p>Mr. Freeh's memorandum, which was addressed to the bureau's deputy director, William J. Esposito, recounted remarks made to Mr. Esposito by Mr. Radek, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Radek was traveling in Europe today and was not immediately available for comment. But in a prepared statement released to The Associated Press, he said he did not recall making such statements.</p>
        <p>''I have no recollection of ever saying I was under pressure because the attorney general's job hung in the balance,'' Mr. Radek said. ''Nor is it something I would have said because it has no basis in fact.''</p>
        <p>Myron Marlin, the Justice Department spokesman, said Ms. Reno's actions were based on the law, not on personal or political considerations. ''This attorney general has never let her own self-interest color her decision-making,'' he said. ''She proceeds by the book, based on the facts and the law.''</p>
        <p>Rallying to Ms. Reno's defense, Justice Department officials noted that the attorney general sent nine separate matters to independent counsels for investigation.</p>
        <p>In 1997, a year after Mr. Freeh's memorandum, the officials noted, Ms. Reno expanded the jurisdiction of Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel whose inquiry into the Monica Lewinsky matter led to the president's impeachment in 1998. In Mr. Freeh's memorandum, which is being studied by the House and Senate judiciary committees, he told Mr. Esposito that he had confronted the attorney general and Mr. Radek and urged them both to step down from the investigation, the officials said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reno apparently refused, and the rift between her and Mr. Freeh has widened considerably during Mr. Clinton's second term.</p>
        <p>The investigation of Democratic fund-raising began in the midst of Mr. Clinton's re-election campaign in 1996, when Justice Department prosecutors reviewed several instances of questionable fund-raising by senior Democrats, including Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>The vice president came under intensive scrutiny by prosecutors over his activities at what was later described as a fund-raising event at a Buddhist temple in Hacienda Heights, Calif., in April 1996.</p>
        <p>In a letter on Nov. 1, 1996, to a top federal prosecutor in Los Angeles, Mr. Radek said the local investigation of the incident had to be brought to a halt and turned over to the Justice Department in Washington because of the potential for appointment of an independent counsel.</p>
        <p>''Your office should take no steps to investigate these matters at this time,'' Mr. Radek wrote.</p>
        <p>The temple inquiry eventually exonerated Mr. Gore, although it led to an conviction of a California fund-raiser, Maria Hsia, who helped organize Mr. Gore's visit to the temple.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore said initially that he did not know that the temple event was a fund-raiser, although he later acknowledged that he knew it was ''finance-related.''</p>
