        <p>With his recent statements on China trade and the deployment of American troops in Kosovo, Gov. George W. Bush has placed himself squarely in a Republican tradition of favoring internationalism and presidential supremacy in foreign policy.</p>
        <p>But the question is how much of a challenge he would face as president from his own party, which has been increasingly fractured over foreign policy in the post-cold war era between internationalists and an isolationist wing suspicious of many foreign entanglements?</p>
        <p>Indeed, even though the Senate today by a vote of 53-47 shelved a measure -- opposed by President Clinton, Vice President Al Gore and Mr. Bush alike -- that could have terminated American military participation in Kosovo next July, it was mostly Democrats who ensured the provision's defeat.</p>
        <p>Only 15 of the 55 Senate Republicans heeded Mr. Bush's warnings that this was a ''legislative overreach'' that would step on the foreign policy prerogatives of the next president. Among those who voted to keep a Kosovo withdrawal deadline was the majority leader, Trent Lott.</p>
        <p>Moreover, this is not an isolated vote. Even though most Congressional Republicans are rallying behind President Clinton on granting normalized trade relations with China, legislation that Mr. Bush also supports, this is an issue of paramount importance to Republicans' business constituency.</p>
        <p>Across other areas of foreign policy, where business is less of a factor, there have been a host of occasions over the past years in which Congress has declared independence from the president on foreign policy and shown a suspicion of mutlilateral engagements. Certainly the idea -- which Mr. Bush was trying to re-establish in his statement on Kosovo -- that Congress bows to the president on foreign policy has long disappeared.</p>
        <p>In December 1998 when the United States began bombing Iraq just as the House was about to vote to impeach President Clinton, Senator Lott refused to back the military action and questioned Mr. Clinton's motives, asking whether the timing of the raids was related to the impeachment vote.</p>
        <p>Last spring, when Mr. Clinton was acting as the leader of the NATO airstrikes on Kosovo, many Republican lawmakers opposed his policy. And in the House, Representative Tom DeLay, the majority whip who is currently rounding up votes for China trade alongside Mr. Clinton, helped engineer the House defeat of a resolution endorsing the air campaign.</p>
        <p>Next came the Senate defeat last fall of the nuclear test ban treaty, followed by Senator Jesse Helms's floor proclamation this year that he would block approval of any treaties negotiated by Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>A key question is how much of this could come back to haunt Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Politically it is advantageous for him right now to look like the new Republican who is trying to rein in the excesses of Congress. In a speech last fall, he warned that the protectionist wing of his party was pursuing ''a shortcut to disaster,'' and he called for a policy of ''decidedly American internationalism.'' But as president he would have to show that he could really define and carry out such a policy.</p>
        <p>Many Republicans say that Mr. Bush would not face problems from a Republican Congress -- that many of these votes across the years have stemmed not from Republican isolationismbut from the poisonous relations between Congress and Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''What this is about on the Republican side is a deep dislike and distrust for President Clinton, '' said SenatorChuck Hagel of Nebraska, one of the 15 Republicans who joined with Democrats to defeat the time limit on funds for the deployment. Mr. Hagel had reached out last week to Mr. Bush's chief foreign policy adviser, Condoleezza Rice, to alert the Bush campaign of the implications of pending Kosovo vote and find out where Mr. Bush stood.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hagel said today that he thought only eight of the Senate Republicans truly reject internationalism. ''If you have a President Bush,'' he said ''you'll find all this settle down considerably in the Republican caucus next year. There will be a new found trust and confidence that he's our guy. And if our guy says it's okay to be in Kosovo, that makes somewhat of a difference.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Bush is more in sync with Republicans in Congress on a number of foreign policy issues. He is interested in building a robust antiballistic missile defense and like Mr. Helms has said he would rather leave it up to the next president, not Mr. Clinton, to negotiate with the Russians on the issue. He did not split with Senate Republicans when they voted down the test ban treaty last year.</p>
        <p>And when Mr. Bush called for a ''distinctly American internationalism'' in a major foreign policy speech last year, he said that while America must be involved in the world, ''that does not mean our military is the answer to every difficult foreign policy situation -- a substitute for strategy.''</p>
        <p>Ever since the Republicans took control of Congress, Democrats have often branded such views as isolationism. And the Republicans have certainly given them fodder, such as when Representative Dick Armey, the Texas Republican who is the House majority leader, once bragged about his disinterest in foreign travel. ''I've been to Europe once,'' he told reporters in the Capitol. ''I don't have to go again.''</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore has also wielded the isolationist label against Mr. Bush. The vice president recently accused him of being ''stuck in a cold war mindset.'' Stressing Mr. Bush's lack of foreign policy experience, Mr. Gore added, ''One has to assume that these gaps in Governor Bush's foreign policy views and experience will be filled by the ideologies and inveterate antipathies of his party -- the right-wing, partisan isolationism of the Republican Congressional leadership.''</p>
        <p>The Republicans take umbrage at such remarks. ''It is far, far from an isolationist caucus,'' Mr. Hagel said speaking of Senate Republicans.</p>
        <p>But there were signs today that some Republicans are ready to flex their muscles on foreign policy no matter who is President. ''I'm in the legislative branch and I'm protecting my prerogatives,'' said Senator Tim Hutchinson, an Arkansas Republican who voted in favor of the time limit for funding the Kosovo deployment.</p>
        <p>He said he had confidence that Mr. Bush, as president, would immediately set a time limit for disengagement in Kosovo. But if Mr. Bush did not do so, Mr. Hutchinson said, ''I think you'd see efforts to set deadlines and Congres would move to try to disengage there regardless if there's a President Gore or a President Bush.''</p>
