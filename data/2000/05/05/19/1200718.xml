      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article on Wednesday about a lawsuit by the artist Al Hirschfeld against his dealer, Margo Feiden Galleries, referred imprecisely to its payments to him. The contract stipulated that the gallery owner, Ms. Feiden, must pay Mr. Hirschfeld an annual minimum of $12,000 if the contract was to be renewed. Her payments this year have been more than that sum, not equal to it.</p>
