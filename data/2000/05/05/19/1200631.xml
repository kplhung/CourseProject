        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said at a nationally televised town hall meeting in Manhattan last night that he still had not reached a decision about his treatment for prostate cancer or whether he would remain in the race for United States Senate.</p>
        <p>His advisers now say the decision could come this weekend.</p>
        <p>The mayor told Andrea Mitchell of MSNBC, who was moderating the meeting at the 92nd Street Y, that the decision about his treatment had turned out to be more difficult than he ever imagined.</p>
        <p>When he discovered he had prostate cancer, the mayor said, ''I put a whole process into place'' for making a decision. ''I kind of approached it as if this was a big case, or a budget decision.'' But he learned, he said, that ''this is a different kind of decision.''</p>
        <p>''It involves thinking about your life, mortality, the quality of your life,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Throughout the hourlong program, Ms. Mitchell frequently asked the mayor if he regretted some of his most controversial actions of the last year, including his verbal attacks on Patrick M. Dorismond, the unarmed black man who was shot dead by police in March. For the first time, Mr. Giuliani said he regretted not having been more sympathetic to Mr. Dorismond's family. ''In doing that I made a mistake,'' he said, adding, ''I should have also conveyed the human feeling that I had, the compassion, the loss of the mother. I think if I could do it over again, I would have tried to balance it more.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Giuliani did not say he regretted releasing Mr. Dorismond's juvenile police record, a decision for which he was roundly criticized.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Giuliani spoke, the state Republican Party continued with plans to nominate the mayor as its Senate candidate 11 days from now in Buffalo. The party, which is operating on the assumption that the mayor will run, has already spent tens of thousands of dollars on ''Rudy'' posters to be festooned all over the convention site. The state Democratic Party nominated Hillary Rodham Clinton as its Senate candidate on Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>Republicans moved yesterday to turn up the pressure on Mr. Giuliani to make a decision. A senior state Republican official said that party leaders had contacted one of Mr. Giuliani's senior advisers to warn him that the mayor's political future with the state party would be in ruins if he dropped out of the race now -- unless it turned out, the official said, that the mayor had additional medical complications.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Giuliani's cautious deliberations are driving Republicans, his campaign staff and the news media to high levels of irritation and anxiety, several prostate cancer specialists said yesterday that the mayor was taking no longer to determine his treatment than many other men. Many patients, doctors said, can take months to decide. The delay is not a problem, they added, because most prostate cancers are slow to grow. The mayor learned he had cancer on April 26.</p>
        <p>''He's going through a process that lots of people go through,'' said Dr. Michael J. Droller, the chairman of the urology section at Mount Sinai Medical Center, who is not directly involved in Mr. Giuliani's case. ''There's so much information out there. A lot of it hasn't been validated. You talk to friends, and they have had very varying experiences, some good, some bad. It gets down to an individual decision and nobody knows why they make that decision but they do it because it feels right.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's two main choices are radiation or surgical removal of the prostate. He said on Monday that he had wavered between the options, and said yesterday at a morning news conference that he was not leaning in either direction. He also said that the possible side effects from the treatments were complicating his decision.</p>
        <p>''You find that that does sort of overlap into the thinking,'' Mr. Giuliani said at the news conference.</p>
        <p>Most men of Mr. Giuliani's age, 55, chose surgery, which doctors say can have a cure rate as high as 95 percent. But side effects after surgery include both incontinence and impotence. Doctors say the rates of incontinence and impotence vary widely, depending on the patient's age, his functioning before surgery and the skill of his doctor.</p>
        <p>In a report in the Journal of the American Medical Association last year, a team of scientists led by Dr. Janet L. Stanford of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle found that almost 60 percent of patients were impotent after prostate surgery. But Dr. Patrick C. Walsh, a specialist at Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore who developed the ''nerve-sparing'' prostate operation intended to preserve sexual function, said that 75 to 90 percent of patients under the age of 60 -- provided they were in the hands of experienced surgeons -- recover sexual function a year and a half after the operation.</p>
        <p>A mayoral adviser said that Mr. Giuliani had spoken to at least a dozen experts around the country and had recently traveled to Baltimore to meet with Dr. Walsh.</p>
        <p>Doctors say that radiation in the form of ''seeds'' implanted into the prostate appears to give patients a better chance of a full recovery, although Dr. Droller at Mount Sinai said he had no specific statistics.</p>
        <p>In either case, doctors said that Mr. Giuliani should be physically able to run for Senate.</p>
        <p>Dr. Droller said most patients got back to complete, normal activity within 12 weeks. If Mr. Giuliani were to have surgery in early June, shortly after the Republican state convention on May 30, he could presumably be at full speed by September at the latest, when candidates traditionally start running all out.</p>
        <p>Seed implantation, Dr. Droller said, would require at the most an overnight stay in the hospital. ''If he had the seeds, he could pretty much get right back into it,'' Dr. Droller said.</p>
