        <p>Worse, the S.U.V. might become even more of a status symbol.</p>
        <p>The federal government should have imposed adequate safety and performance standards on S.U.V.'s long ago, and it is a scandal that it took the chairman of the Ford Motor Company to spotlight the problem.</p>
        <p>The solution is a public-relations effort to achieve a shift in public attitudes as we saw on smoking. S.U.V.'s must be seen as unfashionable, selfish indulgences that are hazardous to public safety.</p>
