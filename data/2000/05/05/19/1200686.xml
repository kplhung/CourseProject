        <p>HE seldom scores. For that matter, he seldom shoots. But he is the Devils' constant. If the Devils are playing, Ken Daneyko is playing.</p>
        <p>In an era when too many professional athletes jump at the drop of a dollar sign, Daneyko is a dinosaur. He has not only spent his entire National Hockey League career with the Devils, he has no desire to play anywhere else.</p>
        <p>''When the Devils drafted me in 1982,'' he said, ''I didn't know where New Jersey was except that it was near New York, but now I couldn't imagine playing anywhere else.''</p>
        <p>Nobody else could imagine that either. As the Devils lost, 4-2, last night to drop behind the Philadelphia Flyers by two games to one in the four-of-seven-game Eastern Conference finals, their 36-year-old defenseman was playing in their, and his, 121st Stanley Cup playoff game.</p>
        <p>Most hockey players are about goals or assists or penalty minutes or shutouts, but Daneyko is about games, about consistency and dependability. He vividly remembers certain moments in certain games, but he wants to forget about last night's performance.</p>
        <p>''We lacked a little jump,'' he was saying now. ''We were sluggish for some reason. They capitalized on their chances and we didn't. But we've got to stay positive. This is no time to panic. We know now that Game 4 Saturday night is imperative.''</p>
        <p>In losing the last two games to the Flyers, the Devils hardly resembled the defensive wall that eliminated Florida and Toronto in earlier rounds, especially the virtually perfect sixth game against the Maple Leafs only 10 days ago.</p>
        <p>Daneyko's 1,070 regular-season games rank second (to Detroit's Steve Yzerman) among active  players with the most career games, all with one team.</p>
        <p>On the all-time list, Daneyko's 1,070 games are tied for 11th place with, coincidentally, Craig Ramsay, the Flyers' coach who was a forward for the Buffalo Sabres.</p>
        <p>The leader is Alex Delvecchio, a center in 1,549 games for the Red Wings, a total that is probably out of reach for Daneyko.</p>
        <p>''I'll keep playing,'' he said, ''until I lose that passion.''</p>
        <p>Through the years, that passion has always separated Daneyko from most of his 186 teammates. Growing up in Edmonton, he was a 14-year-old  in a summer hockey school where Mark Messier, then 17 but already in the World Hockey Association, was an instructor.</p>
        <p>''Mess told me, 'I see the fire in you, keep working,' '' Daneyko said. ''That's what I've always tried to do. Just keep working.''</p>
        <p>When most hockey players reflect on their careers, they remember a big goal or a big save. But Daneyko remembered big games.</p>
        <p>''When we won the last game of the season in 1988 on Johnny MacLean's goal to get into the playoffs for the first time, that was the turning point of the franchise,'' he said, alluding to the struggle of the Devils' early seasons. ''I was on the ice when Johnny scored but instead of rushing to him, we all just skated around like little kids for a few seconds.''</p>
        <p>Almost in passing, he added, ''I scored in that game.''</p>
        <p>He has not scored that often. Only 34 career regular-season goals, none in 74 shots in the recent season. Only four playoff goals, none since his goal in 1995, when the Devils won the Stanley Cup with a four-game sweep of the Red Wings in the finals.</p>
        <p>''After Shawn Chambers scored with about six minutes to go to just about clinch the cup,'' he said, ''I finished that game with tears coming down my face.''</p>
        <p>In 1994, the Devils battled the Rangers into overtime at Madison Square Garden in the seventh game of a classic conference final series, only to lose on Stephane Matteau's goal.</p>
        <p>''But I wasn't too dejected that year,'' Daneyko said. ''I knew and we knew we had left everything out there on the ice. I had a lot worse feelings the last two years.''</p>
        <p>He meant the first-round playoff losses to Ottawa in six games in 1998 and to Pittsburgh in seven games a year ago. But under Larry Robinson's firm hand as coach now, the Devils resembled a Stanley Cup contender until last night.</p>
        <p>''When Larry came here as an assistant coach in 1993,'' Daneyko said, ''he really taught me about positioning, how to use your stick, how to deflect pucks, how if you see a big hit, take it but don't run around wasting your energy.''</p>
        <p>Daneyko grew up watching Robinson, a Hall of Fame defenseman for Montreal and a feared fistfighter when aroused.</p>
        <p>''One night I remember seeing Larry beat up Dave Schultz on television,'' he said, referring to the Broad Street Bullies' prince of the penalty box in that era. ''Those things stick in your mind.''</p>
        <p>But last night's loss won't stick in Ken Daneyko's mind.</p>
