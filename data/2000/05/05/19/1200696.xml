        <p>Momenta Art  72 Berry Street  Williamsburg,  Brooklyn  Through June 5</p>
        <p>This wry group show is a mild acid bath for a strain of swoony celebrity worship in recent art. A couple of stars actually do appear. Janeane Garofalo is one, seen in Alyson Levy's ''Parent Trap''-type photographic tableaus. Another is the Mexican comedian Enrique Cuenca, in a daffy video by Miguel Calderon.</p>
        <p>There's name-dropping, of course, as in the case of Cary Leibowitz's ''Liza Minnelli for President'' rain ponchos. (''In Liza we trust,'' they say in fine print.) And the painter Leslie Brack, the curatorial brains behind the show, contributes a painting of Courtney Love with her head dissolved into angry-looking clouds.</p>

        <p>This wry group show is a mild acid bath for a strain of swoony celebrity worship in recent art. A couple of stars actually do appear. Janeane Garofalo is one, seen in Alyson Levy's ''Parent Trap''-type photographic tableaus. Another is the Mexican comedian Enrique Cuenca, in a daffy video by Miguel Calderon.</p>
        <p>There's name-dropping, of course, as in the case of Cary Leibowitz's ''Liza Minnelli for President'' rain ponchos. (''In Liza we trust,'' they say in fine print.) And the painter Leslie Brack, the curatorial brains behind the show, contributes a painting of Courtney Love with her head dissolved into angry-looking clouds.</p>
        <p>Suzy Spence's fleet, Alex Katz-y depictions of Hamptons party animals fill the rich-and-famous slot, along with Daniela Rossell's photograph of a glamorous women surrounded by sculptured black men in an ornate high-rise apartment.</p>
        <p>Finally Larry Krone, who harbors ambitions to be a country-western luminary, takes a star turn with a personal fashion statement: a full suit of denim cowpoke gear with glittery chaps, floret buttons and a designer label reading, ''Made with tender loving care by the tender Big Lar.'' It's some kind of major.</p>
