        <p>The speaker of the State Assembly moved swiftly to put down a revolt within his chamber today, retaliating against renegade lawmakers and enlisting the support of influential union officials and party leaders to shore up his power base.</p>
        <p>The actions by the speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat from Manhattan, came a day after the second-most-powerful member of the Assembly, Michael J. Bragman, announced that he would attempt to topple the speaker in a vote next week. Mr. Silver immediately stripped Mr. Bragman of his position as majority leader, cut his $34,500-a-year stipend and had him locked out of his office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bragman, a veteran assemblyman from the Syracuse area, is one of the few Democratic leaders in the Assembly with enough broad-based support among moderates, conservatives and a handful of liberals to be seriously considered as a replacement for Mr. Silver.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bragman today gave no indication that he intended to back down, insisting that he had amassed enough support to unseat Mr. Silver and, in the process, deprive New York City of the powerful speaker's office for the first time in a quarter-century. Mr. Bragman also released a strongly worded statement denouncing Mr. Silver's leadership as self-serving, secretive and aloof.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bragman's maneuvering touched off turmoil within the chamber's Democratic caucus, as lawmakers representing a broad range of regional, ethnic and ideological interests jockeyed for the most favorable position throughout the day.</p>
        <p>But in the end, it was difficult to say who would prevail, in part because many lawmakers declined to speak openly about where their loyalties were, for fear of ending up on the losing side when the tally was finally called. That said, Mr. Silver had managed to pick up the support of key members of the Assembly by day's end, strongly improving his prospects for survival.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silver wasted no time in trying to reassert his control over the chamber's increasingly fractious Democratic majority. He stripped two lawmakers who sided with Mr. Bragman of their leadership titles and then cut their annual pay by $12,500 each. Mr. Silver's surrogates warned that other members ran the risk of losing their committee assignments and other valuable perks if they joined the coup attempt.</p>
        <p>But not all the intrigue today took place within the Capitol's stone walls. Mr. Silver spent much of last night and today on the phone reaching out to some of his core supporters -- most notably Dennis Rivera, president of 1199, the politically potent hospital workers' union, and Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers.</p>
        <p>In an interview this afternoon, Mr. Rivera offered his support for Mr. Silver, crediting him with pushing several important measures through the Legislature, including a plan to provide health care coverage to hundreds of thousands of uninsured New Yorkers.</p>
        <p>He also sharply criticized Mr. Bragman and his supporters, saying their actions hurt Democrats at a crucial moment. He said it was important that party leaders present a united front in the campaign to elect Hillary Rodham Clinton to the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>''We are baffled by this,'' said Mr. Rivera, who is an influential force within the Democratic Party. ''This smells of the crude politics of insiders who are more interested in their political careers than in the public good.''</p>
        <p>The toppling of a sitting speaker is a rare event in the Legislature, and Mr. Bragman's threat left the Capitol in a state of shock and confusion. The anxiety was even expressed by some Republican leaders of the State Senate, who worried that such dissension would eventually spread to their ranks.</p>
        <p>The day was also filled with speculation over what prompted Mr. Bragman to strike now. One theory had it that Mr. Silver had weakened himself politically by attempting to block State Comptroller H. Carl McCall's unofficial candidacy for governor in 2002 in favor of Andrew Cuomo, the secretary of housing and urban development.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCall has built strong support with Democrats across the state, and many members of the Assembly were angered by Mr. Silver's actions. But today, Mr. McCall, along with other Democratic officials, strenuously denied that gubernatorial politics had anything to do with the turbulent events of the last 48 hours.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCall also sought to dismiss rumors that he had a role in trying to topple Mr. Silver, rumors that have been fueled by the chilly relationship between the two men over the years. ''It is not useful for me to be involved in this in any way,'' he said, adding that the timing of the coup attempt was bad given the need for Democrats to unite in the current political season.</p>
        <p>The more likely explanation for Mr. Bragman's action was the role played by Thomas J. Manton, the Queens Democratic leader. Mr. Manton has had a long-running feud with Mr. Silver, and he recently offered to deliver most of the borough's 15 Assembly members to Mr. Bragman provided he moved quickly to topple Mr. Silver, according to people involved in the talks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Manton has accused Mr. Silver of encouraging Walter F. McCaffrey, a New York City councilman, to wage a primary challenge against an incumbent assemblyman, Joseph Crowley of Queens. Mr. Crowley is a close ally of Mr. Manton.</p>
        <p>In a speech tonight at the Queens County Democratic Organization's annual dinner in Queens Village, Mr. Manton defended his role in the coup attempt. ''Sometimes you have to fight the good fight,'' he said to 400 guests. ''You can't let your members be abused or not respected. When you are right, you fight. You don't surrender.''</p>
        <p>Both the Bragman and Silver camps spent the day conducting head counts. Many people expect that Mr. Silver will prevail in the end, but they acknowledged that it was dangerous to dismiss completely Mr. Bragman's chances, however dim.</p>
        <p>Even so, Mr. Silver appeared to be consolidating his hold on the Assembly by day's end, securing the support of some of the chamber's most influential members, including Herman D. Farrell Jr., the Democratic leader in Manhattan; Clarence Norman Jr., the Democratic leader in Brooklyn; and Roberto Ramirez, the Democratic leader in the Bronx. The support from these lawmakers strengthened Mr. Silver's chances of survival.</p>
        <p>A speaker is traditionally chosen by the majority party's members in an election held behind closed doors at the start of a newly elected Legislature's two-year term. When a candidate emerges with a majority -- in this case, 50 of the 98 Democrats -- the full Assembly is convened and the members of the majority party unite behind that candidate in a formal vote.</p>
