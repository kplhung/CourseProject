        <p>Mike Jarvis, the St. John's basketball coach, acknowledged yesterday that his agent had spoken with the Washington Wizards yesterday. But Jarvis said there was no offer on the table.</p>
        <p>Jarvis said his lawyer, Robert Ades, met with the Wizards' Michael Jordan, the head of basketball operations, yesterday but characterized the discussions as informational. He was careful not to say he was Jordan's top candidate; that was a mantle the former Atlanta Hawks coach Lenny Wilkens assumed prematurely last week. Jarvis also cautioned that if he received an offer, it was not a foregone conclusion that he would accept it.</p>
        <p>''He's talking and listening,'' Jarvis said of the discussions between Ades and Jordan. ''He's gathering information. Negotiations would not be the right word. People are talking. I have to be prepared before an offer is or is not made. Once I make a decision, I've got to be comfortable with it. You can't go into anything blindly. I have the world's greatest respect for Michael Jordan, but he will be just one factor in the decision. You make a list. You list pros and cons. Reasons why you would and wouldn't.''</p>
        <p>He also said Jordan was in no hurry to make a decision even though the former Bulls star has indicated that he would like a head coach in place before Sunday's league lottery draw.</p>
        <p>''If anybody knows Michael Jordan, Michael Jordan is not stupid,'' Jarvis said. ''Michael Jordan is not going to offer a job unless he is absolutely sure I'm going to take the job.''</p>
        <p>Regarding the process, Jarvis said, ''This is a great educational opportunity for me.''</p>
        <p>Jarvis also said he would not be intimidated working for Jordan and handling pro players.</p>
        <p>''If and when the time comes that I'm offered the job, I would not be any more worried about that than when people said I couldn't go from high school to college,'' he said. ''In any business, you make sure you surround yourself with a great staff.''</p>
        <p>Jarvis said he planned to attend the Big East meetings in Florida, which begin Monday.</p>
        <p>He said he has kept the St. John's athletic director Ed Manetta Jr. informed of the situation and assured him that no one at the Red Storm  program is ''going to pick up a paper and read their coach is gone and he had a press conference in another city.''</p>
