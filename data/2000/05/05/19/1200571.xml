        <p>IT is increasingly common for marketers to focus advertising on teenagers and 20-something consumers in the hope of developing shopping patterns that become lifelong buying habits. Now the ABC television network is joining the ranks of advertisers like Kraft Foods and Procter &amp; Gamble with an ambitious campaign intended to stimulate demand among consumers 16 to 24 for four of its own ''products'': daytime soap operas.</p>
        <p>The four ABC soaps, which include mainstays like ''All My Children'' and ''General Hospital,'' are suffering declines in viewership as millions of women work outside the home.</p>
        <p>Not only are there fewer potential viewers at home in the afternoons when the daytime dramas are broadcast, but younger women coming home from school or after-school jobs find no mothers or grandmothers there to fill them in on when Luke met Laura. As a result, the interest among those younger viewers in episodic drama is increasingly being satisfied at night rather than during the day; the WB network has capitalized on that with prime-time series like ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer,'' ''Dawson's Creek,'' ''Felicity'' and ''Roswell.''</p>
        <p>''This is a genre that built its success on generational viewing,'' said Angela Shapiro, the New York-based president for the ABC Daytime division of the network, owned by the Walt Disney Company. ''We're looking for more and more ways to bring in younger viewers so they'll be there for us in the future.''</p>
        <p>In other words, if they're not tuned in by 25, fuhgeddaboudit, as a character on that nighttime soap ''The Sopranos'' might say.</p>
        <p>''In the daytime genre, you have shows that last for decades, so once viewers get hooked, they watch through the ages,'' said Marc Berman, media analyst for the Mediaweek.com unit of VNU USA, who writes The Programming Insider, a daily e-mail newsletter. ''You don't see that in any other day part.''</p>
        <p>''But the biggest problem is to build the franchise, to get new viewers to watch the soaps,'' he added. ''Otherwise the audience will be older women glued to the set.''</p>
        <p>The ABC Daytime effort, by M/K Advertising Partners in New York, carries the theme ''Plunge in this summer,'' to encourage sampling of the soaps while viewers are out of high school and college. The television, print, poster and postcard campaign, with a budget of $7 million, was researched for a year.</p>
        <p>''We love the genre because it has a really loyal following,'' said Karin Henderson, principal and executive creative director at M/K. ''So we wanted to find aspects that might draw in somebody who was unfamiliar with these soaps.'' The others are ''One Life to Live'' and ''Port Charles.''</p>
        <p>''And the ending of certain shows appealing to this audience is an opportunity for us,'' she added, referring to the wrap-ups of two nighttime soaps on Fox Broadcasting, ''Beverly Hills 90210'' and ''Party of Five.''</p>
        <p>The campaign concentrates on certain core elements, said Ms. Henderson, who also worked on campaigns for ABC Daytime with her business partner, Mary Beth Weil, at Grey Entertainment.</p>
        <p>''The dialogue is great, so we use that,'' Ms. Henderson said. ''The talent is appealing and the story lines can be a little outrageous.</p>
        <p>''Then there's the aspirational value to the viewer: 'I want to be like that. I want to look like that.' You're seeing someone more relatable to yourself.''</p>
        <p>So all the ads present younger cast members from the four soaps, shot in delectable black and white to look their tastiest. Each is identified with a word meant to define or describe the character he or she plays; the pithy labels include ''Rebel,'' ''Vixen,'' ''Hottie,'' ''Gutsy,'' ''Smooth,'' ''Player'' and ''Virgin.''</p>
        <p>The ads use character names rather than the names of the actors, perhaps because the actors portraying the characters come and go but the characters remain soap stalwarts. For instance, the ads running with the label ''Rebel'' identify the young man as Lucky Spencer of ''All My Children''; the actor shown is Jacob Young, who recently took over the part from Jonathan Jackson.</p>
        <p>In the commercials, the actors speak and behave in character. Mr. Young preens and says: ''Rules? I don't play that game.'' Erin Hershey, who plays Alison Barrington on ''Port Charles,'' the character identified as ''Trouble,'' prances, slaps herself on the rump and declares: ''Watch and learn, kids.''</p>
        <p>And David Fumero, who is Cristian Vega on ''One Life to Live,'' lives up to his designation, ''Hottie,'' by smoldering into the camera and asserting: ''Trust me. I know exactly what I want.''</p>
        <p>The goal is to convince younger viewers that ''the stories,'' as many soap fans call their shows, are easy to begin following; are worth watching day after day, week after week; and are a fun summer escape.</p>
        <p>''It is a daunting task,'' Ms. Henderson said, ''but we've always approached daytime advertising by going after the available viewer. As erosion in viewership has occurred, we need to try and attract a different viewer.''</p>
        <p>The commercials begin running tonight on the ABC broadcast of the 27th annual Daytime Emmy Awards and will continue through the summer on prime-time shows that are intended for teenage and younger female viewers, like ''Making the Band'' and ''Sabrina the Teenage Witch.'' The print ads will run in magazines like Allure, Cosmopolitan, Entertainment Weekly, Glamour, Marie Claire, Seventeen, Soap Opera Digest and Teen People.</p>
        <p>There will also be ads on the ABC Web site (www.abc.com) under the breathless rubric ''Summer-sational Hot Teen Site.''</p>
        <p>''What they're doing is admirable,'' Mr. Berman, the analyst, said, ''but I don't know if it will help that much. Even in summer, it's difficult to reach the young, who are traveling, at the beach and working, not necessarily home.''</p>
        <p>One benefit of the campaign, he added, is that it may persuade younger women to start taping episodes of soap operas or watching them on SoapNet, a new cable television network from ABC and Disney that presents reruns of the shows.</p>
        <p>Or maybe the members of the boy band 'N Sync could take turns playing Lucky on summer Fridays.</p>
