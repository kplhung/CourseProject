        <p>The state's highest court ruled yesterday that a man accused of strangling eight women in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., cannot avoid the possibility of a death sentence by pleading guilty.</p>
        <p>In December 1998, the suspect, Kendall L. Francois, tried to plead guilty to murder before prosecutors had decided whether to charge him with capital murder and seek the death penalty.</p>
        <p>But the Dutchess County district attorney, William V. Grady, refused to accept the plea, saying that Mr. Francois did not have the right to do so during the 120 days prosecutors are allowed after an arraignment to decide whether to seek the death penalty.</p>
        <p>On Christmas Eve, the day after Mr. Francois tried to plead guilty, Mr. Grady announced that he would seek the death penalty.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for Mr. Francois appealed, saying their client could  plead guilty at any time.</p>
        <p>But the argument was rejected in July by the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court, and yesterday, the Court of Appeals upheld that ruling. The unanimous decision, written by Judge Howard Levine, found that the state's 1995 death penalty law did not give capital murder defendants the right to sidestep a district attorney's period of deliberation. Until completion of that deliberation, Judge Levine wrote, ''a capital defendant does not have an unqualified right to plead guilty to the entire indictment.''</p>
        <p>A lawyer for Mr. Francois, Mark Harris of the state's Capital Defender Office, said there were still several issues to be resolved in the case but the matter of the guilty plea ''is sort of dead.''</p>
        <p>The justices noted that if the decision had been otherwise, ''it would inevitably result, in the most heinous or high profile cases, in an unseemly race to the courthouse between the defense and prosecution to see whether a guilty plea or notice of intent to seek the death penalty will be filed first.''</p>
        <p>The murder trial is expected to start this fall in Dutchess County.</p>
        <p>Mr. Francois is accused of strangling eight women and stashing their bodies in the Poughkeepsie house that he shared with his family in a 22-month killing spree. He was arrested in September 1998.</p>
