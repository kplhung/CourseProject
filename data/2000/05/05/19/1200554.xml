        <p>The much-admired sculptor Robert Gober will represent the United States at the 2001 Venice Biennale. Known for his surreal and perfect re-creations of body parts and everyday objects like sinks, urinals and drainpipes, he relates his work to the explicit and social-political art of the late 80's and early 90's in oblique and illusive ways.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gober, 46, lives in New York City. He was selected by the Fund for U.S. Artists at International Festivals and Exhibitions, a public-private partnership of the National Endowment for the Arts, the United States State Department, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trusts, after curators and contemporary-art museums nationwide were asked to propose candidates.</p>

        <p>The much-admired sculptor Robert Gober will represent the United States at the 2001 Venice Biennale. Known for his surreal and perfect re-creations of body parts and everyday objects like sinks, urinals and drainpipes, he relates his work to the explicit and social-political art of the late 80's and early 90's in oblique and illusive ways.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gober, 46, lives in New York City. He was selected by the Fund for U.S. Artists at International Festivals and Exhibitions, a public-private partnership of the National Endowment for the Arts, the United States State Department, the Rockefeller Foundation and the Pew Charitable Trusts, after curators and contemporary-art museums nationwide were asked to propose candidates.</p>
        <p>The curators of Mr. Gober's installation are James Rondeau, associate curator of contemporary art at the Art Institute of Chicago, and Olga Viso, associate curator at the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington. The installation is to consist of eight sculptural works: seven designed specifically for the four galleries of the United States pathe Whitney Biennial.</p>
        <p>Four of the new sculptures will be variations on a large piece of white Styrofoam that Mr. Gober found on the beach near his studio on Long Island. ''They will be cast in bronze,'' Mr. Rondeau said. ''The process of translation from the actual object to the symbolic is always at play in Gober's work.'' Mr. Rondeau added that the sculptures make loose reference to the theme of water, which has been important to the artist.</p>
        <p>The exhibition in Venice will be the first major site-specific installation of Mr. Gober's work since one at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles three years ago.</p>
        <p>Rubens for the Israel</p>
        <p>Saul Steinberg may be selling much of his furniture at Sotheby's next week (Antiques, Page 38) and a stash of old master paintings through Richard L. Feigen, the Manhattan dealer, but he has decided to give the Israel Museum in Jerusalem an important Rubens.</p>
        <p>The painting, ''Death of Adonis (With Venus, Cupid and the Three Graces),'' dates from around 1614.  Mr. Steinberg bought it in 1982 from Jeffrey H. Loria, the Manhattan dealer. The painting is monumental in scale -- about 7 by 11 feet -- and depicts Ovid's tale of the death and lamentation of Adonis.</p>
        <p>It is the second Rubens to enter the museum's collection. The first, ''Romulus and Titus Tatius'' (circa 1630-34), was bequeathed to the museum in 1986 by Sam Weisbord, a Los Angeles collector. The one Mr. Steinberg has given is larger and far more important.</p>
        <p>''A couple of years ago we talked to Saul about our desire to build our old master collection,'' said James Snyder, director of the museum. ''This is a signature, mature painting and our first major Rubens.''</p>
        <p>Two years ago the museum began renovating its European art galleries. It also initiated a drive to encourage benefactors to strengthen its old master collection. Last year it received Poussin's ''Destruction and Sack of the Temple of Jerusalem'' (1625-26) as a gift from the Rothschild Foundation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Snyder said the Rubens would go on public view in about a week.</p>
        <p>Sketches by Leonardo</p>
        <p>Although many of the finest old master paintings and drawings have been sent to auction in Manhattan for sale recently, Sotheby's in London has made some important discoveries that will be included in its July sales.</p>
        <p>Just this week, the old master drawings department announced that on July 5 it would auction a sheet of unpublished drawings by Leonardo da Vinci.</p>
        <p>In 1878, members of the Calando family, Paris collectors, bought the sheet at auction. It has been in the family ever since and has remained unknown and unpublished.</p>
        <p>''I don't think they realized how rare drawings like this are,'' said Gregory Rubinstein, director of Sotheby's old master drawings department in London. ''Apart from the listing in the Paris sale catalog, no image or other details of the drawings have been publicly seen.''</p>
        <p>The double-sided sheet depicts Hercules holding a club. Several other pen-and-ink sketches depict an executioner, whirlpools and a device for blocking the flow of a river.</p>
        <p>The work, expected to sell for $640,000 to $960,000, was seen by Prof. Giulio Bora, a leading authority on Leonardo, who confirmed that the sheet was by the artist.</p>
        <p>''This study sheet, with its series of rapid sketches,'' Mr. Rubinstein said, ''contains so much of the essence of Leonardo's art: the seamless transition between art and science; sketches of waterworks combined with a heroic figure study; the free use of whatever drawing medium was most appropriate to the task in hand; and the surprises that the artist constantly springs on us.''</p>
        <p>An Early Whistler</p>
        <p>The cover of Christie's catalog for its sale of American paintings on Thursday features an early Whistler, ''Harmony in Gray: Chelsea in Ice'' (1864), a landscape of figures against the Thames embankment. The painting, estimated at $2.5 million to $3.5 million, comes from descendants of Denys Sutton, an English collector.</p>
        <p>Christie's hung the Whistler with its Impressionist and post-Impressionist art right before last week's sales, hoping to lure collectors whose taste is more European to consider buying a serious American painting. ''Whistler was a great late-19th-century expatriate painter, and like Sargent and Cassatt, he appeals to both types of buyers,'' said Paul R. Provost, head of Christie's American paintings department.</p>
        <p>While early Whistler landscapes like this one are rare on the auction market, some experts say the painting's muted palette may not make it a popular choice. There hasn't been one like it for sale at auction since 1987, when Sotheby's sold ''Variations in Violet and Green'' (1871) for about $2 million. It is now in the Musee d'Orsay in Paris.</p>
