        <p>The Potter family of Tremont, N.H., is awfully behind the times. Asa, the father, is the county road agent, vigilant in his neighborly functions of snow removal and the occasional emergency rescue but inept as a politician and unable to use a computer. His 19-year-old son, Warren, is a crack mechanic but he cannot face the fact that his girlfriend, Jeannie, a promising student, is going off to college in the fall. And Rita, mother and wife, is the kind of homemaker who keeps the coffee pot on and instinctively salves every setback with fresh-baked cookies.</p>
        <p>In Daisy B. Foote's flawed but affecting new play, ''When They Speak of Rita,'' which opened Wednesday night at Primary Stages in Clinton, trouble, of course, is a-brewing along with the coffee. The outside world, a place where other people have money and travel and do things without the circumscription that holds the Potters in place, is both threatening and alluring, and the main conflict for all the characters here is the devil you know versus the devil you don't.</p>
        <p>This may be an old story for most people, but the Potters have managed not to confront it until now, and their individual resolutions of how to proceed as Tremont is yanked along at the tail end of progress make effective kitchen drama. Rita (Hallie Foote, the playwright's older sister), who earns money cleaning houses for newly arrived, wealthy city folks, dreams of being a caterer -- or anything but what she is. Reading in the newspaper about accomplished Frisbee players, she marvels sadly, ''There are so many things in this world that a person can be good at.'' Isolated in their small town, and sealed off from one another in their Yankee stoicism, the Potters are unprepared for Rita's desperately impetuous revolt.</p>
        <p>In nine scenes stretching over 10 eventful months, Warren (Jamie Bennett) starts his own garage and impregnates and marries Jeannie (Margot White), who gives up college; Asa (Ken Marks) loses his job in an election to an interloping newcomer and, not incidentally, Rita runs off with her son's best friend, a sweet-tempered boy named Jimmy (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) whose own parents are violently unhappy and who has long sought solace in Rita's kitchen, a modestly homey place (a perfect-pitch design by Jeff Cowie) where, he tells her, she is ''a bright, shining star.''</p>
        <p>This central event is obviously crucial to the advancement of the narrative but it is also the play's chief problem, at least as Ms. Foote has written it here. All the characters are skillfully drawn as long as they are expressing themselves obliquely and mundanely. Asa, who is devastated when his wife leaves, cannot muster any greater expression of affection when she returns than to say, ''I missed your cooking.''</p>
        <p>That's the heartbreaking norm, and the play is persuasive in evoking an environment where such emotional strictures are inviolable. But when Ms. Foote has them speak their hearts, as in a scene in which Jimmy pours out his love for Rita and she responds, the writing seems clumsily estranged from the rest of the script, and the actors cannot help but be similarly so from their characters. Their coming together is abrupt -- an explosion of feeling that has been contortedly restrained -- but Ms. Foote has not solved, in language, the credibility problem. You simply don't believe Jimmy or Rita is capable of such things.</p>
        <p>Still, there is much here that makes suspending disbelief worthwhile, and much of that has to do with this being a family play in more ways than one. Daisy Foote is the younger daughter of Horton Foote, who as as a playwright and screenwriter is a proven master of small-town family implosions, and he has directed this play with the quiet confidence of someone who recognizes a story that can tell itself. Ms. Foote has said in interviews that the play is derived from an interval decades ago when her father, who grew up in rural Texas, the setting for many of his own works, moved the family to New Hampshire, and his sense of the internal pressure building inside a home translates northward seamlessly.</p>
        <p>The directorial touches -- a door's timely slamming to punctuate the end of a conversation, a motor running in the garage -- are infrequent and beautifully orchestrated, giving the silence that surrounds the dialogue in the Potter kitchen a powerful and subtle resonance.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Foote has cast the play with care and skill, beginning with Hallie Foote, his daughter and a frequent leading lady in his own plays. As Rita, she is the image of rectitude fighting off tremulousness. In the end, appalled by her own rashness and her yearning still inarticulable, she is defined not by her circumstances but by the fullness of her depressed character. Her apology to Asa -- ''I'm sorry about everything, about everything that's happened, about everything that I've done; I'm very, very sorry'' -- is a brutal acknowledgment of defeat. Rita's nadir is the high point of a skilled performance.</p>
        <p>In the ensemble around her, everyone is convincing, from Mr. Marks, who allows Asa's undemonstrative presumption to unravel subtly into helplessness, to Ms. White, who turns a teenage girl into an earnestly self-assured mediator, the family's best hope for emotional guidance. Mr. Bennett, as Warren, the most competent and closed-minded Potter, and Mr. Moss-Bachrach, a lanky young actor with a spectacularly unruly haircut, who gives Jimmy the sincere and gentle charm of a foolishly misguided boy growing up too fast, make their torn-apart friendship a genuine loss. You end up caring about these people -- and the playwright -- even when they lapse.</p>
