        <p>About 20,000 people gathered again tonight to protest the Serbian government's seizure of the main opposition television station here, Studio B, but as they were dispersing, policemen in riot gear charged them.</p>
        <p>There were clashes with the demonstrators, some of whom then threw stones and homemade firebombs at the police, who responded in turn with truncheons and a lavish use of tear gas. At least 19 people were hurt, beaten by the police, and ambulances picked them up at City Hall, where once again opposition political leaders conferred with one another but did not address the crowd.</p>
        <p>There were smaller rallies tonight in other Serbian towns controlled by the opposition, including Kragujevac, Nis, Cacak, Smederevo, Uzice and Novi Sad. In Nis, protesters reportedly beat some local legislators of the Socialist Party of Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
        <p>In Belgrade, the continuing absence of the leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement, Vuk Draskovic, became a topic of increased discussion. Belgrade is controlled by Mr. Draskovic's party, and the seizure of Studio B, which the Serbian government said had called for insurrection, is interpreted as a direct attack on Mr. Draskovic.</p>
        <p>A Draskovic adviser, Predrag Simic, said tonight that Mr. Draskovic was engaged in high-level discussions with foreigners. Spasoje Krunic, head of the Belgrade City Council, said Mr. Draskovic was in ''a safe place.''</p>
        <p>But politicians from other parts of the opposition said privately that Mr. Draskovic was still in Montenegro, Serbia's restive sister republic, fearing arrest or an attempt on his life. During the NATO bombing war last year, Mr. Draskovic criticized the Democratic Party's leader, Zoran Djindjic, for having gone to Montenegro when he felt his life was threatened by the government. But tonight, Mr. Djindjic refused to comment on Mr. Draskovic's whereabouts.</p>
        <p>It appeared that one reason opposition leaders chose not to speak to the crowds on Wednesday night or tonight was because they had nothing new to say, and had not agreed on a strategy, said Dragan Kopcalic, the former leader of the Democratic Party's Belgrade branch. ''Few people really believe in these leaders,'' he said. ''This is a serious moment, but there is no serious political concept of how to motivate people.''</p>
        <p>But some opposition leaders and analysts believe that the protests could grow. given the heavy-handed actions of the Milosevic government and the high level of frustration among an impoverished populace.</p>
        <p>Mr. Djindjic is pressing the opposition leaders for a more aggressive response to the crackdown on Studio B and the independent radio stations B2-92 and Radio Indeks, he said in an interview tonight.</p>
        <p>''We can have rallies for a few more days,'' Mr. Djindjic said. ''But we must find a new concept to increase the pressure on the regime, and the tool are the city halls we control throughout Serbia. We've lost Studio B, but we have the other city halls, and we must invest them in order to create the pressure to regain Studio B and radicalize the situation with widespread protests and civil disobedience.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Djindjic's efforts to do just that have failed in the past, and Mr. Draskovic's party is not convinced, its officials say, fearing that the central government could respond by taking over control of Belgrade's government. In fact, Mr. Krunic said, a meeting of the Belgrade city assembly was postponed today when the leader of the nationalist Radical Party, Deputy Prime Minister Vojislav Seselj of Serbia, showed up with scores of heavily armed bodyguards.</p>
        <p>For Belgrade's people, today brought a total absence of independent broadcast news. Studio B ran government material, the B2-92's frequency played music, and Radio Pancevo, the reputable station of a nearby town, was cut off, its transmitter to Belgrade seized by the police.</p>
        <p>Even during the war last year, when B2-92, then called B-92 was taken over by the state, there was Studio B and Radio Pancevo.</p>
        <p>''Now, there's nothing, only silence,'' said Roksanda Nincic, a reporter for the independent weekly Vreme. ''I spent the morning trying to get on to the Internet to find out what happened a kilometer from my house.''</p>
        <p>Veran Matic, the editor in chief of B2-92 and head of an association of independent media, said that the station was putting news on the Internet, and that the BBC was retransmitting news by satellite to some 30 local radio stations and 17 local television stations in Serbia. But the stations could not be heard in Belgrade.</p>
        <p>The crackdown has included restrictions on the ability of the popular tabloid Blic to print its normal press run. Blic's reporters and editors had been locked out of their offices, which are in the same building as Studio B, but were allowed to return this afternoon.</p>
