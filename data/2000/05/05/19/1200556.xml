        <p>Looking to build on the muscle it started to show this season with its wrestling franchise, the UPN network has announced plans for the fall television season including two new dramas and 10 weeks of the new XFL football league, geared to the same young male viewers who support wrestling.</p>
        <p>UPN is also adding one new comedy and importing a second from ABC that will fit with its other programming direction: comedy aimed at a black audience.</p>

        <p>Looking to build on the muscle it started to show this season with its wrestling franchise, the UPN network has announced plans for the fall television season including two new dramas and 10 weeks of the new XFL football league, geared to the same young male viewers who support wrestling.</p>
        <p>UPN is also adding one new comedy and importing a second from ABC that will fit with its other programming direction: comedy aimed at a black audience.</p>
        <p>The import is ''The Hughleys,'' which had a two-year run on ABC with mixed success. It is about a black family headed by the stand-up comedian D. L. Hughley adjusting to life in the Los Angeles suburbs.</p>
        <p>The new comedy is ''Girlfriends,'' which deals with the high-volume friendship of four black women, all single, in their 20's. One of the producers is Kelsey Grammer of NBC's ''Frasier.''</p>
        <p>The new dramas, both action-oriented, are being scheduled for Friday nights to capitalize on promotions during Thursday night wrestling.</p>
        <p>''Freedom'' deals with a future America that has fallen under a totalitarian regime, with the only hope being four heavily muscled and armed rebels fighting to overthrow the bad guys. The executive producer is Joel Silver, whose movies, including ''The Matrix'' and the ''Lethal Weapon'' series, have similar themes.</p>
        <p>The other drama is ''Level 9,'' about a top-secret law enforcement group that fights the worst sorts of criminal conspiracies.</p>
        <p>The network will also carry games of the new XFL league on Sunday nights at 7 starting in February. The XFL games are to be produced by World Wrestling Federation Entertainment Inc., which also supplies UPN's weekly ''Smackdown'' wrestling show.</p>
        <p>Here is the UPN schedule:</p>
        <p>MONDAY: ''Moesha,'' ''The Parkers,'' ''The Hughleys,'' ''Girlfriends.''</p>
        <p>TUESDAY: Movies.</p>
        <p>WEDNESDAY: ''7 Days,'' ''Star Trek: Voyager.''</p>
        <p>THURSDAY: ''W.W.F. Smackdown.''</p>
        <p>FRIDAY: ''Freedom,'' ''Level 9.''</p>
