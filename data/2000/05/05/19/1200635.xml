        <p>With a scathing indictment of the federal response to fires that have now burned nearly 80 square miles of northern New Mexico and more than 400 housing units, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said today that the government was wholly to blame and would do whatever possible to compensate victims.</p>
        <p>''The calculations that went into this were seriously flawed,'' Mr. Babbitt said at a news conference in which federal officials described how a planned burn for a small section in Bandelier National Monument quickly raged out of control, overtaking wide areas beyond, including the city of Los Alamos and the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where nuclear weapons are designed.</p>

        <p>With a scathing indictment of the federal response to fires that have now burned nearly 80 square miles of northern New Mexico and more than 400 housing units, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt said today that the government was wholly to blame and would do whatever possible to compensate victims.</p>
        <p>''The calculations that went into this were seriously flawed,'' Mr. Babbitt said at a news conference in which federal officials described how a planned burn for a small section in Bandelier National Monument quickly raged out of control, overtaking wide areas beyond, including the city of Los Alamos and the Los Alamos National Laboratory, where nuclear weapons are designed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Babbitt compared the combination of poor planning and bad decisions by people in the National Park Service and the Forest Service to ''a cascading series of events, like a rock being dislodged down a hill, leading to a landslide.''</p>
        <p>Mistakes began with missing weather information and led to problems from a lack of firefighters, equipment and judgment about a situation that that grew increasingly dangerous by the hour.</p>
        <p>Mr. Babbitt's remarks were timed with the release of the results of a federal investigation into what happened from the evening of May 4, when Park Service personnel at Bandelier National Monument ignited what officials call a ''prescribed fire,'' or burn, a means commonly used to remove dead and dried underbrush in an effort to reduce the possibility of a catastrophic fire.</p>
        <p>Investigators found that almost every aspect of the plan for the prescribed fire was poorly conceived and carried out, beginning with the critical omission of wind predictions for several days into the burn. For some reason, the investigators found, information was not passed along to officials responsible for authorizing the burn and for managing it.</p>
        <p>Investigators also said the park official who was in charge of the burn, Mike Powell, lacked the proper experience to manage a fire once it raced out of control. Mr. Powell's boss, Roy Weaver, the superintendent of Bandelier National Monument, has been on administrative leave since the fires spread. Mr. Powell is still working at the park.</p>
        <p>Mr. Weaver, who has been with Park Service for 33 years, has been in charge of the national monument for 10 years. In that job, he has overseen two or three controlled burns a year.</p>
        <p>''The technical and operational experience of the burn boss was not adequate,'' said Dick Bahr, a burn specialist with the Park Service from Boise, Idaho, who is one of the investigators. ''He had not seen a fire of this complexity and size.''</p>
        <p>The fire was about 65 percent contained today.</p>
        <p>About 1,200 firefighters were still at work, strengthening fire breaks, extinguishing hot spots and attacking the fire's northwestern flank, The Associated Press reported.</p>
        <p>As forceful as he was in ascribing blame, Mr. Babbitt was equally strong in saying that the federal government would accept full blame for the wildfire. He said Congress was developing emergency legislation that would compensate people who had lost their homes and businesses. A similar measure in 1976 helped people affected by a break in the Teton Dam in Idaho to receive compensation within three months.</p>
        <p>Mr. Babbitt also said the Clinton administration was ''on the wavelength'' to sign the pending legislation, once it passed the House and the Senate, which he predicted was likely to happen soon.</p>
        <p>In Washington, Senator Pete V. Domenici, Republican of New Mexico, said he and others in the state's Congressional delegation had met with administration officials, adding that they were planning to work together ''to establish some principles that we ought to incorporate in a law that will permit us to pay damages to the New Mexicans and other institutions that have been damaged by this fire.''</p>
        <p>But Senator Domenici was also critical of what he called ''this negligence'' that led to the destruction, adding that ''the people of New Mexico and this country deserve to be very, very upset and to demand a much better performance and to insist that we find a way to recompense the people in that area.''</p>
        <p>So far, the Cerro Grande Fire, as it is now known, has claimed 405 housing units and closed many businesses, most of them in the Los Alamos area, which is about 45 miles from Santa Fe, the state capital. Early estimates put the aggregate loss at more than $1 billion.</p>
        <p>Several of New Mexico's leading elected officials here built on Mr. Babbitt's remarks to assuage fears of those who suffered losses from the fires. Gov. Gary E. Johnson, a Republican who spent much of the day with Mr. Babbitt, urged New Mexicans to ''document, document, document your losses'' to expedite the paperwork in making claims.</p>
        <p>''The federal government could not have done a better job responding to a terrible situation,'' Mr. Johnson said. ''Los Alamos was hit by an 18-wheeler, and the government was driving the 18-wheeler. But don't hire an attorney yet. Give the government a chance to make good on this.''</p>
        <p>The thrust of the report was to review how decisions were made leading to the initial burn, how the authorities responded, whether management personnel had proper training and experience and whether existing procedures were adequate to cover all contingencies once the fire spread.</p>
        <p>The findings were nearly universal in their condemnation. These were some of the major conclusions:</p>
        <p>*The plan for the prescribed burn was inadequate in that federal personnel did not take into account the complexities of the terrain and the material to be burned.</p>
        <p>*No one analyzed the plan with a critical eye toward unexpected developments, which resulted in ignoring the possible need for additional firefighters and equipment if the fire went out of control. As the fire spread, state and local firefighters found themselves overwhelmed, with some people on the lines working 24 hours and longer without a break.</p>
        <p>*The plan did not take into account predictions of wind conditions over the three to five days after ignition. The information was missing in Mr. Weaver's assessment, and no one else he consulted mentioned it.</p>
        <p>*Coordination among federal, state and local agencies was lacking, and when other opinions were sought there was a lack of critical analysis. ''You can't rubber stamp these things,'' Mr. Bahr said. ''Everybody has got to be involved in everything.''</p>
        <p>*Once the fire spread, suppression tactics that were used did not comply with federal standards in effect since 1995, a transgression that aided the fire's growth and threatened public safety. ''The policy is sound,'' said Joe Stutler, a fire operations specialist from Redmond, Ore., who was a member of the investigation team. ''But federal agencies working jointly did not put it together.''</p>
        <p>The report made public today is only the first step in assessing procedures that are routinely used throughout the West, which is highly susceptible to raging fires.</p>
        <p>Mr. Babbitt has appointed a four-member board of inquiry that will take a harder look at what happened here, with technical experts possibly recommending administrative or punitive actions. That board, Mr. Babbitt said, is expected to complete its work by late next week.</p>
