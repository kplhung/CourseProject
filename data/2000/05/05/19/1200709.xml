        <p>The Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency order this evening, telling all airlines that use the Boeing 767 to check the steel bolts holding the plane's engines in place, after an airline found damage on both bolts under one wing and one of the two on the other side.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the order, the inspection must be completed within five days, said Eliot Brenner, a spokesman for the agency.

        <p>The Federal Aviation Administration issued an emergency order this evening, telling all airlines that use the Boeing 767 to check the steel bolts holding the plane's engines in place, after an airline found damage on both bolts under one wing and one of the two on the other side.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the order, the inspection must be completed within five days, said Eliot Brenner, a spokesman for the agency. Mr. Brenner said the review would take five hours for each aircraft, meaning it could be done during normal overnight maintenance, and probably would not require any airlines to ground the planes.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't expect any significant impact on the fleet,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Boeing Company, which manufactures the 767, itself advised its customers on Thursday to conduct the inspection; the F.A.A. made that advice mandatory this evening.</p>
        <p>Liz Verdier, a spokeswoman for Boeing, said most airlines would replace the bolts with ones made of an alloy called inconel, used in all the planes built since 1987, she said.</p>
        <p>The bolts stop the engines from swinging from side to side or twisting. There are two for each of the plane's two engines.</p>
        <p>Ms. Verdier said that as of today, 20 other planes had been inspected, and none showed bolt damage. But on the plane where damage was found, two bolts were partly cracked, and one was cracked all the way through, she said. The plane was one of the earliest off the production line, she said. The first 767 was delivered in August 1982.</p>
        <p>The F.A.A. ordered the airlines to to report within 20 days on the inspections. The order applies to 120 aircraft registered in this country. An additional 110 are registered elsewhere, and their operators are highly likely to conduct the inspections.</p>
        <p>A total of 785 of the 767 model have been delivered. American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Trans World Airlines, United Airlines and US Airways carry passengers on the planes, and UPS and Airborne use them for cargo. The planes, which can carry up to 285 passengers, make up more than half the airline flights across the North Atlantic, according to Boeing.</p>
