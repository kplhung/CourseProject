        <p>THE DEMOCRATS</p>
        <p>PITTING BROTHER AGAINST BROTHER -- Trying to foment a bit of sibling discord, the Gore campaign yesterday circulated a newspaper article by Gov. Jeb Bush of Florida that seemed to contradict a plan by his brother Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to allow taxpayers to invest some Social Security payroll taxes in the stock market. In an April 18 op-ed piece in The Tallahassee Democrat, Jeb Bush argued that, because of the stock market's volatility, the state pension system should put part of its $12 billion surplus in a fund that would be reserved for a downturn. ''It makes sense that we take the surplus we have now and place it in a reserve that is not affected by changes in the market,'' he wrote. Mr. Gore's aides said that suggested Mr. Bush wants to withdraw some pension funds from the stock market. A spokesman for Jeb Bush said the Gore campaign had misread the article.</p>

        <p>SEEKING RUNNING-MATE SUGGESTIONS -- Gov. George W. Bush of Texas sent letters to 450 Republicans yesterday seeking advice on a running mate. In the three-paragraph request, which went to United States senators, representatives, governors, state Republican committee members, state party chairmen and Bush for President committees, the governor said: ''My primary concern is to select someone who is capable of serving as president of the United States. I am interested in your thoughts as to individuals whom I should consider as well as any particular issues you believe I should take into account.'' Separately, in a Fox News television interview, Mr. Bush repeated that while he opposed abortion, he would accept a running mate who favored abortion rights -- within limits. Some leaders of the religious right have said Mr. Bush risks losing support should he pick a supporter of abortion rights.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>BATTLING UPHILL IN INDIANA -- With a Presbyterian church as his backdrop, David Johnson, a Democrat who serves as a policy adviser to Gov. Frank L. O'Bannon, cast himself as a champion of Hoosier values this week in beginning his campaign to unseat Senator Richard G. Lugar, a Republican seeking a fifth term. Mr. Johnson declared it was ''time we have a new senator who will put these values into action,'' as he stood outside the Indianapolis church where his father was once pastor. It will be an uphill battle for Mr. Johnson, who has raised $412,000 in contributions. Senator Lugar has amassed $2 million.</p>
