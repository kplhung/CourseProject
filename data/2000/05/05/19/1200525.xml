        <p>''When you sing Jimmy Webb songs, you must speak them in tune because the stories are so profound,'' Glen Campbell declared on Tuesday night at the opening of his five-night reunion engagement with Mr. Webb at Feinstein's at the Regency.</p>
        <p>The names of Mr. Campbell, the Arkansas-born singer, and Mr. Webb, the Oklahoma-born songwriter, have been inextricably linked since the late 1960's, when Mr. Campbell scored successive hits with Mr. Webb's songs ''By the Time I Get to Phoenix,'' ''Wichita Lineman'' and ''Galveston.''</p>

        <p>''When you sing Jimmy Webb songs, you must speak them in tune because the stories are so profound,'' Glen Campbell declared on Tuesday night at the opening of his five-night reunion engagement with Mr. Webb at Feinstein's at the Regency.</p>
        <p>The names of Mr. Campbell, the Arkansas-born singer, and Mr. Webb, the Oklahoma-born songwriter, have been inextricably linked since the late 1960's, when Mr. Campbell scored successive hits with Mr. Webb's songs ''By the Time I Get to Phoenix,'' ''Wichita Lineman'' and ''Galveston.''</p>
        <p>In describing their chemistry, you might say Mr. Campbell's genial down-home style returns Mr. Webb to his country roots while Mr. Webb's soaring romantic melodies lend Mr. Campbell's singing a loftier pop eloquence.</p>
        <p>That chemistry was as solid as ever at Tuesday's concert, which had the feel of an informal pop-country musicale.</p>
        <p>The old friends riffled through the Webb songbook, making only a couple of sidetracks (including ''Rhinestone Cowboy,'' which Mr. Webb did not write). For most of the numbers, Mr. Webb played his fluid, free-form piano, with Mr. Campbell adding some light guitar. The two divided up the vocals and occasionally harmonized.</p>
        <p>Mr. Campbell's twangy, bluegrass-tinged voice is still in splendid condition. As much today as in the 60's, his voice conveys a soaring howdy-folks amiability to even the saddest song. Mr. Webb's darker, throatier delivery of lyrics that burst with an aching adolescent romanticism deepened the performance by tugging gently against Mr. Campbell's unquenchable optimism.</p>
        <p>All the expected oldies were delivered with freshness and heart. But the show's most touching moment was Mr. Campbell's rendition of ''The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress,'' an arching ballad that infuses agonized macho longing and despair with an almost Shakespearean sense of tragedy.</p>
