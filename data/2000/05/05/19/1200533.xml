      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Imagine the younger Kathleen Turner crossed with Sandra Dee, and you'll have some idea of the complicated flavors projected by Barbara Brussell, the gifted Los Angeles-born cabaret performer who is making her debut engagement through June 3 at the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel (59 West 44th Street,Manhattan). Ms. Brussell, who has diligently worked her way up the New York cabaret ladder, has an utterly distinctive voice: medium-size, with a  cottony texture and a quickening vibrato.</p>
        <p>Her phrasing is curtly emphatic and her dramatic instincts are so carefully cultivated that she gives every word a purposeful intention. The emotional cross-currents in her singing are intriguing. Sometimes in the same song, she projects a theatrical incisiveness reminiscent of Betty Buckley but with an undertow of baby doll innocence.</p>

        <p>Imagine the younger Kathleen Turner crossed with Sandra Dee, and you'll have some idea of the complicated flavors projected by Barbara Brussell, the gifted Los Angeles-born cabaret performer who is making her debut engagement through June 3 at the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel (59 West 44th Street,Manhattan). Ms. Brussell, who has diligently worked her way up the New York cabaret ladder, has an utterly distinctive voice: medium-size, with a  cottony texture and a quickening vibrato.</p>
        <p>Her phrasing is curtly emphatic and her dramatic instincts are so carefully cultivated that she gives every word a purposeful intention. The emotional cross-currents in her singing are intriguing. Sometimes in the same song, she projects a theatrical incisiveness reminiscent of Betty Buckley but with an undertow of baby doll innocence.</p>
        <p>Ms. Brussell's new show, ''I Wish You Love,'' in which she is accompanied by Christopher Marlowe on piano and Steve LaSpina on bass, is a far-reaching blend of romantic show tunes and inspirational ballads spiced with some tartly witty changes of pace. Her version of ''I've Got You Under My Skin'' treats this Cole Porter gem as an unalloyed expression of romantic obsession.</p>
        <p>John Wallowitch's introspective ''Photographs'' and the pained but loving parent-to-child reflection ''If I Could,'' by Ken Hirsch, Marti Shannon and Ron Miller, reveal her fondness for American songs that echo the grown-up sentimentality of Europeans like Charles Aznavour.</p>
        <p>The high point of a program that moves from songs of yearning toward deeper expressions of songs of empathy and altruism is her version of Stephen Sondheim's ''No More,'' from the show ''Into the Woods.'' As she belts this plea for people to shuck  self-destructive fairy tale fantasies and embrace the real world, the California dreamer and the New York sophisticate join hands.</p>
