        <p>The vision that changes lives in Laramie, Wyo., on an October morning in 1998 is anything but celestial.</p>
        <p>The first person to experience it, a young man on a bicycle, finds it impossible to believe that what he is looking at is human, initially thinking he has come upon a Halloween effigy, a grotesquely rigged-up scarecrow.</p>
        <p>The second to arrive, a sheriff's deputy, cannot make out the face on the still-breathing body: only two tracks of skin are revealed through the crusted blood. They must have been formed, she speculates with an anguished wonder, by the paths of tears.</p>
        <p>Thus is a 21-year-old man named Matthew Shepard described in the extraordinary final moments of the first act of ''The Laramie Project,'' the enormously good-willed, very earnest and often deeply moving work of theatrical journalism that opened last night at the Union Square Theater.</p>
        <p>These two accounts, taken from transcripts of interviews with citizens of Laramie by the members of the Tectonic Theater Project, are delivered in counterpoint with a third, that of an emergency room doctor who says his mind at first refused to grasp the idea that what was done to Mr. Shepard was wrought by the hands of other men. The note again resonates, a knell that trembles with troubling persistence: what has happened is beyond humanity, at least as any of these three figures has known it.</p>
        <p>''The Laramie Project,'' which has been overseen by the director and writer Moises Kaufman, the inspired talent behind ''Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde,'' is virtuously determined to reclaim that missing human factor, to find the light in an event of harrowing darkness. Mr. Shepard, as much of the world now knows, was an openly gay university student who was beaten, tied to a fence on the outskirts of town and left to die by two men roughly his age. In death, he has become a poster boy for the casualties of anti-gay violence.</p>
        <p>Throughout ''The Laramie Project'' -- which has largely been shaped from interviews conducted during six visits to Laramie by Mr. Kaufman and his ensemble of actors and writers following the crime -- the images of the bloodied Mr. Shepard, beaten beyond recognition, keep echoing. They become the touchstone by which everything else is measured, an unconditional physical reality that cannot be ignored but can, the play suggests, be transcended.</p>
        <p>Reams have already been written on the murder of Matthew Shepard and on the trials of his killers, Russell A. Henderson and Aaron J. McKinney. Those three men remain mostly abstractions here. Whereas ''Gross Indecency,'' the Tectonic group's best-known earlier project, was built around the vivid onstage presence of Wilde, the central players in the tragedy of ''Laramie'' are essentially presented as what they have come to stand for.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Kaufman and his team are after is less a portrait of any person than one of the ethos of a place. In the deliberate, simple formality of its staging, in which eight radiantly clean-scrubbed performers embody 60 different people against Robert Brill's bare-bones set, ''Laramie'' often brings to mind ''Our Town,'' the beloved Thornton Wilder study of life, love and death in parochial New Hampshire.</p>
        <p>To some degree, Laramie is indeed presented as a latter-day Grover's Corners, a cozy place where everyone appears to know everyone else's business and actually finds comfort in this. But if ''The Laramie Project'' nods conspicuously to Wilder, this play is ''Our Town'' with a question mark, as in ''Could this be our town?'' There are repeated variations by the citizens of Laramie on the statement ''It can't happen here,'' followed immediately by ''And yet it has.''</p>
        <p>A young ''Muslim feminist'' student who grew up in Laramie describes this dizzying contrast of idealized perception and deflating reality as something like the confusions induced by the mazes in an Escher print. The observation and the observer are unusually exotic for this play.</p>
        <p>The production's characters, winnowed down from roughly 200 people interviewed, generally fit a more familiar mold of the small-town American Westerner: friendly, plain-spoken, guarded and understandably suspicious of the troupe from New York that has arrived to probe, a self-consciousness that has been incorporated into ''The Laramie Project.''</p>
        <p>They needn't have worried. Even the evening's less sympathetic characters, including the Kansas preacher who showed up at Mr. Shepard's funeral as an anti-gay protester, are served up with respectful caution. Most of the others are wrapped in a warm cloak of affection.</p>
        <p>The production's translation of transcribed interviews and documents may directly recall the methods of the performance artist Anna Deavere Smith, especially in her study of racial conflict in Brooklyn, ''Fires in the Mirror.'' But ''Laramie'' -- which gives credit to a team of a dozen writers and dramaturgs  led by Mr. Kaufman and Leigh Fondakowski -- feels less clinical than Ms. Smith's works in presenting its subjects, and the lack of distance is not always an asset.</p>
        <p>A Roman Catholic priest who arranged the first of the candlelight vigils held for of Mr. Shepard more than once speaks of the importance of a ''correct'' representation of Laramie. That injunction has been thoroughly honored. Though the cast is more than capable in its creation of an affecting emotional climate, only a few of its members have anything like Ms. Smith's ear for revelatory speech patterns and are able to summon portraits that feel correspondingly authentic.</p>
        <p>There is an overriding sense that the characters -- who range from ranchers to university professors, from a lesbian waitress to a Baptist minister -- are cut from the same cloth of perplexed decency, embellished with the occasional signpost of an eccentricity, like the woman who remembers when her Laramie home was isolated enough for her to do her housework in ''my altogethers.''</p>
        <p>There are a few recurring figures who acquire the specificity of fingerprints: one thinks especially of the bicyclist who found Mr. Shepard, embodied with eloquent inarticulateness by Kelli Simpkins, and the deputy sheriff, vibrantly played by Mercedes Herrero, who is exposed to H.I.V. while assisting the wounded Mr. Shepard. By and large, however, these people are defined principally by their responses to an unspeakable event. You aren't allowed to know them, as you are, say, the characters in ''Boys Don't Cry,'' a movie that covers similar material.</p>
        <p>Yet, while running two and a half hours with two intermissions, ''The Laramie Project'' sustains its emotional hold. As Mr. Kaufman demonstrated with ''Gross Indecency,'' he has a remarkable gift for giving a compelling theatrical flow to journalistic and historical material. And here he again finds the implicit music in repeated phrases and themes.</p>
        <p>More than anything, those echoes conjure the feelings of horrified astonishment that certain acts of brutality can still elicit. Actually, the evening itself has the feeling of those candlelight vigils. There is that same sense of a stately procession through which swims a stirring medley of emotions: anger, sorrow, bewilderment and, most poignantly, a defiant glimmer of hope.</p>
