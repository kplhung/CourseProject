        <p>For the first time since Congress eliminated Depression-era barriers last fall that prevented banks and insurance companies from intermingling their businesses, a major insurance company, Metropolitan Life, said yesterday that it was taking steps to go into full-service banking.</p>
        <p>Metropolitan Life, a unit of MetLife Inc. and one of the nation's largest insurers, said it had not decided whether to buy a bank or to get a charter and develop one from the ground up. It did say, however, that it expected to make ''the best use of both traditional banking services and online capabilities.''</p>

        <p>For the first time since Congress eliminated Depression-era barriers last fall that prevented banks and insurance companies from intermingling their businesses, a major insurance company, Metropolitan Life, said yesterday that it was taking steps to go into full-service banking.</p>
        <p>Metropolitan Life, a unit of MetLife Inc. and one of the nation's largest insurers, said it had not decided whether to buy a bank or to get a charter and develop one from the ground up. It did say, however, that it expected to make ''the best use of both traditional banking services and online capabilities.''</p>
        <p>To work out the new banking strategy, Met Life has selected Judy Weiss, a 27-year veteran of Met Life who is the company's chief actuary and one of a handful of executive vice presidents. She is to report to Robert H. Benmosche, Met Life's chief executive and a former investment banker at PaineWebber.</p>
        <p>Analysts said Met Life's decision  was likely to set off a chain reaction.</p>
        <p>''Met Life is such a powerful force in the industry,'' said Tom Burnett, president of Merger Insight, a Manhattan financial research company. ''They are telegraphing that a large insurance company cannot afford to remain solely in their own industry and that you have to diversify to take advantage of the changed regulatory environment.''</p>
        <p>So far, under the new financial services laws, no banks have bought major insurance companies, said Ken Reynolds, executive director of the Association of Banks in Insurance, an organization in Washington. But Larry Mayewski, a senior vice president at the A. M. Best Company, the insurance rating agency, said a handful of banks had begun ''looking for insurance properties.''</p>
        <p>''There's a lot going on behind the scenes,'' Mr. Mayewski said.</p>
        <p>About 30 insurance companies have obtained savings and loan charters and are offering checking and other banking services through agents and on the Internet. But analysts said they expected the Met Life operation to be far larger.</p>
        <p>''This seems to be a more broad-based, aggressive push into the banking area,'' Mr. Mayewski said.</p>
        <p>With a savings charter, banks are expected to offer at least some mortgage loans. Currently, most of their commercial lending is to small businesses, an area with limited prospects for growth. In 1998, Travelers, another big insurer, merged with Citicorp to form Citigroup. That merger anticipated the regulatory change and increased pressure on Congress to bring it about.</p>
        <p>Some analysts said that Met Life's move into banking was inevitable. ''A couple of years ago,'' said Colin Devine, a Salomon Smith Barney analyst, ''you would have said their competitors were the other major insurers. Now their competitors are the big financial services companies like Fidelity, Schwab and Merrill Lynch. They had to do something to keep pace.''</p>
