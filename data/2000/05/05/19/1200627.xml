        <p>As one of the league's brightest young stars and the Nets' best player, Stephon Marbury could play a significant role in the team's search for a coach and a director of basketball.</p>
        <p>Just as he can turn a game in the Nets' favor with a basket or a pass, he could probably influence the team's future hires with a yea or a nay, a smile or a sneer.</p>

        <p>As one of the league's brightest young stars and the Nets' best player, Stephon Marbury could play a significant role in the team's search for a coach and a director of basketball.</p>
        <p>Just as he can turn a game in the Nets' favor with a basket or a pass, he could probably influence the team's future hires with a yea or a nay, a smile or a sneer.</p>
        <p>But Marbury said he would not use his superstar status to force himself into the decision-making process. He said the Nets' owners had not asked his opinion, and he liked it that way.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to have anything to do with that,'' Marbury said today after participating in a practice at the Nets' Champion Center for local youth shooters competing in the National Basketball Association's 2ball championship.</p>
        <p>''Whoever they pick to be the coach, that's who I want to play for because I think they know how everyone is on the team and they know the personality of our team.''</p>
        <p>Harvey Schiller, chairman of YankeeNets, said the Nets would like to have one person serve as the team's president and director of basketball and that the team was still considering several candidates.</p>
        <p>Schiller said no formal interviews had been conducted and that the job had not been offered to anyone. The top candidates include Mitch Kupchak, David Kahn, Isiah Thomas, Lenny Wilkens and John Thompson.</p>
        <p>''With the N.B.A. draft being June 28 and the Chicago pre-draft camp starting on June 6, we feel that we really need to have in place our director of basketball operations by the beginning of June,'' said Finn Wentworth, a Nets owner and the team's acting president. ''That's our target.''</p>
        <p>Thomas is believed to be garnering consideration for both the director of basketball and the head coaching positions.</p>
        <p>''If Isiah could coach half as well as he played that would be great,'' Marbury said of Thomas.''But Magic Johnson coached and he wasn't really too successful with that, so you never know.''</p>
        <p>Marbury has an excellent relationship with Eddie Jordan, a Nets assistant who is being considered for the coaching position, but in keeping with his hands-off policy, the guard refused to endorse anyone.</p>
        <p>''I think Coach Jordan would definitely be suitable because he's a great coach,'' Marbury said. ''I'm not saying because I like him I want him to be the coach. I'm saying I would love to play for him. But I know that the owners have to make that decision as far as what they want to do.''</p>
        <p>Marbury missed the last eight games of the season with tendinitis in his left knee but said today that the knee was fine and he was ''100 percent'' healthy.</p>
        <p>Network in the Works</p>
        <p>Harvey Schiller reiterated yesterday the YankeeNets plans to use their teams -- the Yankees, the Nets and the Devils -- as the foundation of a network to broadcast their games.</p>
        <p>Schiller said the network could either be a new entity or come through the acquisition of an existing network. He said the network would rely on the teams' games as well as other sports and entertainment programming.</p>
        <p>''Those are all going very well,'' Schiller said of negotiations on a new network. ''There are still a number of both what we would call strategic partners and equity interests that we're moving forward on. We're going to try to get these deals done as fast as possible. In spite of press reports, there is no deal that has been completed at this point but we are looking for a very successful completion for where we're going forward on this.</p>
        <p>Ticket Prices Frozen</p>
        <p>The Nets announced that ticket prices would not increase this season. Tickets for Nets games at Continental Arena include price ranges of $25 to $80 in the lower bowl and the upper tier, with a limited number of $5 seats set aside for each game.</p>
