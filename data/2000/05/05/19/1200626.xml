        <p>WCBS-TV and The Daily News announced yesterday that they would begin producing a joint morning news segment as a first step toward collaborating on a range of reporting projects.</p>
        <p>The segment is the latest example of big media companies combining forces to try to reach more customers, in general swapping the larger news-gathering force of the paper with the greater reach of television.</p>
        <p>WCBS-TV said it was hoping that the alliance would help it reach viewers in Brooklyn and Staten Island, boroughs with strong Daily News readership, while the newspaper said it hoped that the segments would prompt viewers to buy the paper.</p>
        <p>''I think newspapers have a larger editorial staff and they can pursue a greater diversity of subject matter,'' said Joel Cheatwood, the WCBS-TV news director. ''It will offer our viewers a broader content mix.''</p>
        <p>The segment, which will last about a minute, will be broadcast at 5:15 a.m. and 6:15 a.m. every weekday on Channel 2. It will highlight the headlines and significant developments from a few Daily News articles deemed to have an exclusive perspective or angle on the news.</p>
        <p>''In this day and age, having a multimedia partnership is key in reaching the broadest possible audience,'' said Marie DeParis, senior vice president of strategic marketing at The Daily News. ''Putting the newspaper news on TV encourages people to buy the newspaper to get all the details.''</p>
        <p>Officials said there were no plans to include reporters from The News in the segments but that might come in the future along with joint reporting on investigative, feature and sports articles. Collaborative Internet efforts are also envisioned.</p>
        <p>Both executives said the agreement was a straight swap, with no financial strings attached. It comes just months after the Tribune Company, which already owned WPIX-TV, bought the parent company of Newsday. The Tribune Company, based in Chicago, has pushed the practice of having its newspaper reporters contribute to news broadcasts on its television stations. A Newsday spokesman said only one preliminary discussion had been held on such an effort in New York.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Cheatwood and Ms. DeParis said the prospect of a Newsday program on WPIX had nothing to do with their plans. But industry analysts believe that competing newspapers and television stations have become acutely aware of the growing attraction of such alliances.</p>
        <p>''This is just another sign of newspaper companies participating in convergence, that is the buzzword now,'' said John Morton, an independent newspaper analyst.</p>
        <p>The Daily News is not the only paper in New York City to team up with a broadcast outlet. In recent years, The New York Times has developed joint programming and journalistic projects with New York 1 News and ABC News.</p>
