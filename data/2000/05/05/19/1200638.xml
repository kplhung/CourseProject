        <p>Latest 'Gotcha' In the Senate Race</p>
        <p>HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, who promised to be a model citizen when she moved to Chappaqua, N.Y., has failed an early civics test. She did not vote in a school board election there on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>This was pointed out by campaign aides for Mrs. Clinton's potential opponent, MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI. The Giuliani campaign aides, who said she had a history of skipping local elections, went so far as to obtain her voting record from Pulaski County, Ark., where she was registered before she moved to Chappaqua -- even while she was living in the White House. It showed that from 1990 to 1999 she was at best an intermittent voter.</p>

        <p>Latest 'Gotcha' In the Senate Race</p>
        <p>HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON, who promised to be a model citizen when she moved to Chappaqua, N.Y., has failed an early civics test. She did not vote in a school board election there on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>This was pointed out by campaign aides for Mrs. Clinton's potential opponent, MAYOR RUDOLPH W. GIULIANI. The Giuliani campaign aides, who said she had a history of skipping local elections, went so far as to obtain her voting record from Pulaski County, Ark., where she was registered before she moved to Chappaqua -- even while she was living in the White House. It showed that from 1990 to 1999 she was at best an intermittent voter.</p>
        <p>''Given that Mrs. Clinton so loves to grandstand about her concern for children,'' said Mr. Giuliani's campaign spokeswoman, JULEANNA GLOVER WEISS, ''we're perplexed that she wouldn't leap at this first opportunity to effect real change here in New York.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton was in Albany on Tuesday, accepting the Democratic nomination for the Senate. Not that her campaign was making excuses. ''I could give you the dog-ate-my-homework answer'' about why she did not vote in the local election, said her spokesman, HOWARD WOLFSON, ''but she just didn't.''</p>
        <p>Just Call Him Bob</p>
        <p>Title- and honorific-conscious academic types have been wondering how to address SENATOR BOB KERREY, the Nebraska Democrat who will become the president of the New School University in Manhattan next year. The issue came up at a fund-raiser at the Waldorf-Astoria the other night.</p>
        <p>''You won't be governor or senator anymore,'' a woman said as the crowd edged into the ballroom. ''Will you be Dr. Kerrey?''</p>
        <p>''No,'' he replied. (He does not have a doctorate; as an undergraduate he was a pharmacy major.)</p>
        <p>''So what will we call you?'' she persisted.</p>
        <p>''Bob,'' he said.</p>
        <p>This was after he had demonstrated he could hold his own on the No. 1 topic at New York cocktail parties: real estate. He said he would not have to worry about paying stratospheric prices in his university-owned apartment.</p>
        <p>''It's brutal out there,'' he said, adding that he likes New York, ''and I look forward to living here.'' But maybe he is still ''Bob from Washington.'' The way he said that last line sounded like a variation on ''I like New York, but I wouldn't want to live there.''</p>
        <p>To Boldly Quote</p>
        <p>There would have been less murmuring in the audience at the Audubon Society's party at Chelsea Piers on Monday night if somebody had brought along a copy of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations.</p>
        <p>PAUL TUDOR JONES II, a hedge-fund manager, was given an award and made a speech. He ended with this quote: ''Cry havoc and unloose the dogs of war.'' He attributed it to ''General Chang in the fifth episode of 'Star Trek.' ''</p>
        <p>That was when the murmuring began in the audience. At table No. 10, EUGENE LINDEN, a writer whose most recent book was ''The Parrot's Lament and Other True Tales of Animal Intrigue, Intelligence and Ingenuity'' (Dutton), said: ''I don't think so. That's Shakespeare.''</p>
        <p>A couple of seats away, EAMES YATES, a filmmaker, went the ''Star Trek'' route. ''It was probably Khan,'' he said, referring to one of the ''Star Trek'' villains.</p>
        <p>A later check of a Bartlett's showed that the Shakespearean line was, ''Cry 'Havoc!' and let slip the dogs of war,'' from ''Julius Caesar,'' and it was quoted in the movie ''Star Trek VI'' by Christopher Plummer, who played Chang, a Klingon with a fondness for Shakespeare.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Jones was thinking about a different kind of book -- his checkbook. After JOHN FLICKER, the president of the National Audubon Society, announced that the evening had raised $750,000, Mr. Jones said: ''That's not enough for a first year. I'll send you a check to make it an even million.''</p>
        <p>Two other awards went to MARIAN S. HEISKELL, who retired as a director of The New York Times Company and is a director of the National Audubon Society, and ROY E. DISNEY, vice chairman of the board of the Walt Disney Company.</p>
        <p>''I started in the film editing room on the nature films,'' Mr. Disney said. ''I was not an artist. I can't draw. So the only way I could find work was in another part of the company.''</p>
