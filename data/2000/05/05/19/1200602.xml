        <p>The Security Council has imposed an arms embargo on Ethiopia and Eritrea in the hope that it will spur the two sides toward a resumption of peace talks.</p>
        <p>In a unanimous vote near midnight on Wednesday, the council barred sale and delivery of arms and other military equipment to the two countries for 12 months -- or until Secretary General Kofi Annan is able to report ''a peaceful, definitive settlement of the conflict.''</p>
        <p>In return for Russian and French support, the United States, which sponsored the resolution, had to drop additional sanctions against Ethiopia, which began this phase of the three-year-old war by attacking Eritrea, a former Ethiopian province, on Friday. The American delegation wanted to bar international travel by Ethiopian officials but other council members said that could hamper peace talks taking place in Algiers. Algeria is the current chairman of the Organization of African Unity.</p>
        <p>It took three days of hard negotiations for the council to reach an agreement on how to deal with the war in the Horn of Africa, which most members agree is pointlessly destructive. Eritrea and Ethiopia were very close to agreement only a few weeks ago, but a Security Council delegation that visited the area last week was unable to dissuade the Ethiopians from reopening the war.</p>
        <p>A time limit on sanctions was demanded by Russia, France and other council members, who say they have seen too many open-ended embargoes imposed -- often at the behest of the United States -- with no policy on what to do about the sanctions when they seem no longer to be effective. The council is studying how to improve the use of sanctions.</p>
        <p>The Russian ambassador, Sergey Lavrov, hailed the vote to put a time limit on sanctions as a historical first for the council. The Russians have been highly critical of the embargo on Iraq, now in its 10th year, without an end in sight.</p>
        <p>Ambassador Nancy Soderberg, who handled the Ethiopian-Eritrean sanctions debate for the United States, said after the vote that the resolution was intended to bolster the Organization of African Unity as it tries to restart peace talks. ''I think it sends an unequivocal and strong message to the parties to bring an end to this conflict,'' she said.</p>
