        <p>Branches sprawl in a convoluted tangle across the heavens of the set at the Women's Project Theater. It's quite an image for a show that exposes the confusing mess of a Mormon family tree in which a father marries his daughter's best friend years before the daughter's husband marries her half sister, who is the daughter of her father and the best friend.</p>
        <p>Whew!</p>
        <p>The flat, stylized tree, dwarfing the stage like Jack's beanstalk, also suggests the fantastical quality of a fable, a touch that enhances the reach of Julie Jensen's lovely new play, ''Two-Headed.''</p>
        <p>The play depicts five episodes over 40 years in the lives of two Utah women of the late 1800's. Steeped in the hard facts of Mormon frontier history, Ms. Jensen's script has a gentle, poetic allure that is wonderfully realized in its New York premiere, directed with relaxed assurance by Joan Vail Thorne.</p>
        <p>Lizbeth Mackay and Deirdre O'Connell play Hettie and Lavinia, childhood friends who are entering adolescence in the wake of tragedy: the 1857 Mountain Meadows massacre, in which more than 100 travelers from Missouri and Arkansas were killed by a Mormon militia and its Indian allies.</p>
        <p>Hettie and Lavinia are haunted by the event, a stain on their emerging universe that won't come out. Guilt afflicts them, though they could no more have stopped the killings than they can stop polygamy or other disempowering aspects of the Mormons' patriarchal culture.</p>
        <p>How do children endure such a burden? Hettie and Lavinia endure thanks to their friendship, which survives challenges that would break others.</p>
        <p>In one scene they try to care for the dead body of their almost iconic best friend, Jane. But the beloved Jane's body is decomposing, and they have no more ice to preserve it.</p>
        <p>Later the proud but indigent Hettie seeks financial support from Lavinia after her husband is institutionalized. Oh, yes: Her husband is Lavinia's father.</p>
        <p>Still later Lavinia rails against the fates when her husband takes another wife. The identity of her husband? The identity of the other wife? You've got the clues. The answers could hardly be more disturbing.</p>
        <p>But Hettie and Lavinia find strength in their ''two-headed'' survival strategy; think of it as one mind knowing the daunting path while another mind is trudging on anyway. Theirs is a friendship enriching lives that, as Lavinia says, you wouldn't wish on anyone.</p>
        <p>Ms. O'Connell in particular seems to relish her role as the mercurial Lavinia, giving an organic snap to moments of pain, anger and mirth. With a dry wit and earthy physicality, Ms. O'Connell attacks her role with an inventive, hotblooded authority. Ms. Mackay has the more reticent role, but her affectionate Hettie has a depth that gives precision, dignity and clarity to her faith.</p>
        <p>Framing the finely portrayed relationship are Michael Lincoln's beautiful lighting and David P. Gordon's involving set. These designers have given ''Two-Headed'' a theatrical style that adds layers to its kernel of a naturalistic environment.</p>
        <p>Running about an hour and 15 minutes, ''Two-Headed'' may seem slight as a full-length play, and its five episodes could seem like separate character sketches as much as they are a fully integrated story. But in this effort from Women's Project and Productions, Ms. Jensen's two heads make an elegant and meaningful whole.</p>
        <p>TWO-HEADED</p>
        <p>By Julie Jensen; directed by Joan Vail Thorne; set by David P. Gordon; costumes by Carrie Robbins; lighting by Michael Lincoln; composer/sound designer, Scott Killian; production stage manager, Paul A. Kochman; production manager, Richard Callahan. Presented by the Women's Project and Productions, Julia Miles, artistic director; Patricia Taylor, managing director. At the Women's Project Theater, 424 West 55th Street, Clinton.</p>
        <p>WITH: Deirdre O'Connell (Lavinia) and Lizbeth Mackay (Hettie).</p>
