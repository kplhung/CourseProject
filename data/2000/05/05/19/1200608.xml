        <p>If Europe is virtually allergic to the genetically modified seeds that are so popular with North American farmers, it got a reason this week to sneeze with fury.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of farmers in England, France, Germany and Sweden are finding that they have unwittingly planted rapeseed oil crops for two years from bags of Canadian seed that inadvertently contained a scattering of genetically modified seeds for the plant used to make canola.</p>
        <p>European governments have emphasized that there is no health risk from the oil produced from last year's crop or environmental risk from the plants that are now growing. Less than 1 percent of one company's seeds had bioengineered genes, meaning that just some individual plants in the millions of acres of rapeseed would be involved.</p>
        <p>But European newspapers are referring to fields as tainted and contaminated, and environmental groups are calling for all the farmers who bought the company's seed to be tracked down and their fields burned before the crops mature and produce pollen that could blow to other plants.</p>
        <p>The seed company, the papers say, should pay for the destroyed crops.</p>
        <p>''This may seem extreme to Americans, but there are a lot of people in Europe who don't want to eat G.M. food under any circumstances,'' said Harry Hadaway of the Soil Association of Great Britain, an organic-farming group.</p>
        <p>The company, Advanta of the Netherlands, said that it did not intend to import any modified seeds and that it had broken no laws, because none govern the genetic content of seeds. Advanta says testing for biotech material at concentrations of less than 1 percent is technically difficult and expensive. But it has halted all its European sales of one variety of rapeseed and asked European governments to create reasonable standards that it can meet.</p>
        <p>According to a spokesman for the company, Kees Noome, the problem was found last month, when the German government conducted random checks of seed.</p>
        <p>Advanta is not sure what ''impurity'' the seeds have, Mr. Noome said,  but the company presumes that it is a resistance to weed killer, a trait that is legal and sought after by many American and Canadian farmers. Advanta also presumes that the trait entered some seeds when pollen blew from other fields. The pollen, Mr. Noome said, would have to have blown ''hundreds of meters,'' because the company ''wouldn't buy seeds from a farmer whose direct neighbor grew the crop.''</p>
        <p>Even nonbiotech seeds, he added, need to be grown as far as feasible from accidental pollination, because farmers buy seeds for particular crossbred traits like disease resistance.</p>
        <p>In Britain, the finding occurred at an awkward moment. Prince Charles lectured on the BBC this week on ''the sacred trust between mankind and our Creator'' and cautioned against ''the artificial and uncontained transfer of genes between species of plants and animals.''</p>
        <p>In The Independent newspaper today, a text of his speech was printed near a prominent commentary that accused the prince of denigrating science and suggesting that the strictly organic methods that he uses on his farms in Cornwall could produce only enough food to feed a world of four billion people, leaving the remaining two billion to starve.</p>
