        <p>Frustrated by the performance of the contractors that it hires to run its nuclear weapons plants, the Department of Energy will demand the right to fire the contractors' top managers and control the managers' bonuses in future contracts, Secretary Bill Richardson said today.</p>
        <p>In addition, under the new policy, decisions on what goals to set for contractors and whether the contracting companies have met those goals and should earn bonuses, will be reviewed directly by the energy secretary. Previously, such decisions were usually made by senior civil servants, not the secretary.</p>
