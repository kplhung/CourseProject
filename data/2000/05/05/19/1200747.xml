        <p>LISSAUER-Diana Fraid. Born in Montreal; heart in New York. Lived courageously; died peacefully on May 18. Wife of the late Franz Lissauer; mother of Emil; sister of Elaine Rush and the late Stephen Fraid; sister-in-law of Bob Rush, aunt of Hillary Rush; loving friend to Mark Trujillo and the many others whose lives were graced and enriched by her intelligence and taste; the celebratory way she decorated and dressed and her kindness and generosity. It is, however, her infectious exuberance and joyous humor that will be most sorely missed. She was curious about many things; passionate about even more: dancing, jazz, opera, gardens, antiques; baseball and the Mets; art; Japanese basket weaving and the Bible - recently; literature, people and ideas - always. Diana, we will forever embrace and cherish your memory. Funeral services Sunday, May 21, 2000, 11:45AM at ''The Riverside'', 76 St. &amp; Amsterdam Ave. In lieu of flowers, contributions may be sent to New School University, Diana Lissauer Scholarship, 66 W 12 St, NYC 10011.</p>
