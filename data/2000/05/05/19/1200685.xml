        <p>An army of vicious thunderstorms blitzed the New York region yesterday, snapping trees and power lines, hurling hailstones, stalling airline travelers for up to eight hours and damaging dozens of homes in the Poughkeepsie area.</p>
        <p>''We got everything -- you name it,'' said Michael Caropolo, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Albany. ''A lot of damage to trees, some damage to cars and unconfirmed reports of a tornado moving through the northern city limits of Poughkeepsie.''</p>

        <p>An army of vicious thunderstorms blitzed the New York region yesterday, snapping trees and power lines, hurling hailstones, stalling airline travelers for up to eight hours and damaging dozens of homes in the Poughkeepsie area.</p>
        <p>''We got everything -- you name it,'' said Michael Caropolo, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Albany. ''A lot of damage to trees, some damage to cars and unconfirmed reports of a tornado moving through the northern city limits of Poughkeepsie.''</p>
        <p>In Orange and Sullivan counties, some 15,000 customers of Orange and Rockland Utilities lost power, said a company spokesman, Jim Lois.</p>
        <p>On Route 211 in the Ulster County town of Wallkill, two roofers, Gary Curtis and Barry Johnson, said they saw funnel clouds touch down, blowing the roof off a delicatessen, The Associated Press reported.</p>
        <p>In northern New Jersey, more than 40,000 homes were left in darkness, according to G.P.U. Energy and Public Service Electric &amp; Gas. Thousands of people in central Bergen County were not expected to have power until at least noon today.</p>
        <p>At Kennedy International Airport, flights were delayed by as much as eight hours, and many planes scheduled to land there were diverted to other airports, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey reported. The Delta shuttle at La Guardia Airport was grounded altogether, the Port Authority said.</p>
        <p>Fallen power lines trapped several people in a car in Hamptonburgh, Orange County, The Associated Press reported. There were no serious injuries.</p>
        <p>The storms, which dumped as much as 1.5 inches of rain within an hour, heralded a cold front that raced south across the region at 50 miles an hour shortly after 5 p.m., the National Weather Service said. Across a wide swath of southern New York and Connecticut, gusts topped 65 miles an hour.</p>
        <p>The forecast calls for gentler rain today, with skies staying mostly cloudy until Sunday.</p>
