        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''A Bungling U.N. Undermines Itself,'' by Michael Ignatieff (Op-Ed, May 15): None of us at the United Nations would pretend that we have got everything right in Sierra Leone. But to suggest, as Mr. Ignatieff does, that the United Nations should abandon peacekeeping altogether overlooks its proven effectiveness, and the lack of viable alternatives.</p>
        <p>United Nations peacekeepers today perform many tasks, from observing a cease-fire on a stable frontline (Cyprus) to administering an entire territory (East Timor). The challenge is to ensure that they have adequate military and material resources -- and only governments can provide those.</p>

        <p>Of course we are dismayed that peacekeepers were taken hostage. But Sierra Leone is no longer suffering the massacres, amputations, rapes and pillage that it endured just a year ago. The United Nations force has made a difference, and is consolidating its position. We are determined to stay the course.</p>
