        <p>''Road Trip'' has a serious lesson to impart. Never, ever send a plate of French toast back to a restaurant kitchen because it happens to be sprinkled with powdered sugar. If that plate should be returned denuded of the dreaded topping by a waiter who seems a tad too obsequious when he plops it down in front of you, it's probably because he knows where that French toast has just been, and you don't. And trust me, you don't want to. If you have any notions of eating what is smilingly put before you, think again, no matter how appetizing it may appear.</p>
        <p>The soon-to-be notorious French toast sequence in ''Road Trip,'' this season's probable hit in the post-teenage gross-out genre revived two years ago by ''There's Something  About Mary,'' is one of more than half a dozen such sequences that should keep young audiences chortling, snorting and snickering over the next several weeks.</p>

        <p>''Road Trip'' has a serious lesson to impart. Never, ever send a plate of French toast back to a restaurant kitchen because it happens to be sprinkled with powdered sugar. If that plate should be returned denuded of the dreaded topping by a waiter who seems a tad too obsequious when he plops it down in front of you, it's probably because he knows where that French toast has just been, and you don't. And trust me, you don't want to. If you have any notions of eating what is smilingly put before you, think again, no matter how appetizing it may appear.</p>
        <p>The soon-to-be notorious French toast sequence in ''Road Trip,'' this season's probable hit in the post-teenage gross-out genre revived two years ago by ''There's Something  About Mary,'' is one of more than half a dozen such sequences that should keep young audiences chortling, snorting and snickering over the next several weeks.</p>
        <p>Because ''Road Trip'' doesn't feature stars of the magnitude of Cameron Diaz, Ben Stiller and Matt Dillon, it may not make as much money as its prototype. But it reveals its director Todd Phillips and his screenwriting partner Scot Armstrong as clever mad scientists of dumb cinematic raunch. They know exactly how far to push the envelope without earning their film an NC-17 rating. Both seem to possess a demonic understanding of how buried in the deepest recesses of the primmest sensibility lurks a pimply, potty-mouthed adolescent yanking down his pants and screaming for attention.</p>
        <p>Vying with French toast for No. 1 on the list of the movie's farcically raunchy bits is a scene set in a sperm bank in which an alarmingly aggressive nurse helps an unsuspecting young man discover the erogenous potential of his nether parts. Then there's a corpulent woman's seduction of a chicken-chested male virgin so skinny he makes Don Knotts look like a Charles Atlas graduate.</p>
        <p>Like the drugged-dog jokes and the hair gel sequence in ''Mary'' and the pie and beer scenes in last year's ''American Pie,'' ''Road Trip's'' carefully planted comic shocks are this movie's primary raison d'etre. Yet even in these tactics there can be discerned the glimmerings of an agenda.</p>
        <p>For one thing, Beth (Amy Smart), the flaxen-haired college girl who is the movie's closest thing to a heroine, is sexually forward in a way that only designated ''sluts'' are allowed to be in Hollywood movies. Far from being punished for her lustful ways  in ''Road Trip,'' she is ultimately rewarded with something like true love. Chalk one up for girl power.</p>
        <p>The sperm bank scene, for all its outrageous exaggeration, insinuates a more polymorphous perverse view of male sexuality than Hollywood movies almost ever allow. And as comical as it appears with its clashing body types, the (interracial) sex scene has an underlying sweetness. His sexual initiation transforms the movie's 97-pound weakling into a  psychic he-man who musters the courage to stand up to his bullying dad.</p>
        <p>Most of ''Road Trip'' follows the desperate cross-country dash of Josh (Breckin Meyer), a student at Ithaca College, and three fellow students to Texas to intercept a pornographic home video that was accidentally mailed to Josh's longtime sweetheart at the University of Austin. In that video, Josh, who has pledged his fidelity to his 1,800-mile-distant girlfriend, is shown being seduced by Beth, with whom he won a date at an auction.</p>
        <p>To make the trip, the boys strong-arm Kyle (DJ Qualls), a quivering little milquetoast whom they normally wouldn't give the time of day, into lending them his father's car with the implicit promise that he is now one of them. It almost goes without  saying that the precious vehicle is doomed. But the manner of its destruction, following a spectacular flying leap across the gap in a rickety wooden bridge, is as funny an auto demolition as any movie has given us in some time.</p>
        <p>Like ''There's Something About Mary,'' ''Road Trip'' has the loose shambling structure of a rock 'n' roll shaggy dog story and no pretenses to realism. Where ''Mary'' had a strolling troubadour nudging the story along, ''Road Trip'' is narrated by Barry (the MTV comedy star Tom Green), the travelers' geeky friend,  who remains in Ithaca so he can have the opportunity to feed white mice to his roommate's insatiable pet python. When the snake loses its appetite, Barry, crazed with visions of animal carnage, momentarily (and hilariously) confuses himself with the reptile.</p>
        <p>If ''Road Trip'' is a hit, it is likely to inspire the usual puritanical hand-wringing about the foul state of movies and Hollywood's going to hell in a handbasket. But if you think back a few years, this movie is a lot funnier (and, dare I say, smarter) than the last cycle of gross-out movies initiated by ''Porky's.'' As we all know, bad taste is timeless. And sometimes it can be so funny that you can't help laughing.</p>
        <p>''Road Trip'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). It has sexual situations, nudity, strong language and many pungently off-color jokes.</p>
