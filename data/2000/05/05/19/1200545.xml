        <p>Artistic ingenuousness is something that's difficult, if not impossible, to fake. That's one reason why Woody Allen's silly new comedy, ''Small Time Crooks,'' is such a pleasantly surprising little treat. In this sweet, funny wisp of a movie, Mr. Allen shucks off his fabled angst and returns in spirit to those wide-eyed days of yesteryear, before Chekhov, Kafka and Ingmar Bergman invaded his creative imagination. As willfully goofy and freshly scrubbed as Mr. Allen's 1969 directorial debut, ''Take the Money and Run,'' it suggests that that once a naif always a naif, that at the core of Mr. Allen's sensibility persists an inviolable strain of innocence.</p>
        <p>The plot of this flighty caper comedy that begins as a spoof of ''Big Deal on Madonna Street,'' then morphs into something resembling a child's-eye ''Bonfire of the Vanities,'' often feels as if it were being plucked out of thin air while the movie was  being shot. Put a bunch of children in an attic with a trunk full of costumes and have them improvise a play, and what they come up with might well have the same short-term memory as ''Small Time Crooks,'' in which some seemingly major characters all but disappear once the movie shifts gears.</p>

        <p>Artistic ingenuousness is something that's difficult, if not impossible, to fake. That's one reason why Woody Allen's silly new comedy, ''Small Time Crooks,'' is such a pleasantly surprising little treat. In this sweet, funny wisp of a movie, Mr. Allen shucks off his fabled angst and returns in spirit to those wide-eyed days of yesteryear, before Chekhov, Kafka and Ingmar Bergman invaded his creative imagination. As willfully goofy and freshly scrubbed as Mr. Allen's 1969 directorial debut, ''Take the Money and Run,'' it suggests that that once a naif always a naif, that at the core of Mr. Allen's sensibility persists an inviolable strain of innocence.</p>
        <p>The plot of this flighty caper comedy that begins as a spoof of ''Big Deal on Madonna Street,'' then morphs into something resembling a child's-eye ''Bonfire of the Vanities,'' often feels as if it were being plucked out of thin air while the movie was  being shot. Put a bunch of children in an attic with a trunk full of costumes and have them improvise a play, and what they come up with might well have the same short-term memory as ''Small Time Crooks,'' in which some seemingly major characters all but disappear once the movie shifts gears.</p>
        <p>''Small Time Crooks'' suggests that despite the excoriating bitterness of such 90's films as ''Husbands and Wives,'' ''Deconstructing Harry'' and ''Celebrity,'' Mr. Allen is in  many ways still a wistful, wisecracking boy from Coney Island laughing at the fancily dressed grown-ups and their pretensions as he munches cotton candy, his nose pressed to the glass separating him from the Manhattan dream world. Look, Ma! What are those weird little things on the dining room table? They're finger bowls, dear.</p>
        <p>Although it's set in modern New York, the mood of ''Crooks'' feels like every movie decade (but especially the 1930's) compacted into an eternal comic present. Like his ''Manhattan Murder Mystery,'' the new film owes as much to 1930's screwball tradition as it does to the present. Not the least of its accomplishments is its portrayal of a bunch of colossally stupid people with trashy tastes as adorable bumblers who emerge as much more human than the rich and snooty sharks with whom they amusingly rub elbows.</p>
        <p>Instead of objects of ridicule, the movie treats its ''little people'' as true-blue common folk whose vulgar tastes reflect a groundedness and even decency, notwithstanding their lust for larceny. For a self-conscious intellectual like Mr. Allen to convincingly express such generosity toward the unlettered is disarming. When one character confuses Henry James with Harry James, we sympathize with her humiliation instead of sneering with the snob whose highbrow name-dropping sails over his companion's head.</p>
        <p>What sets the story whirring is a preposterous scheme for a bank heist proposed by Ray Winkler (Mr. Allen), a meek, addle-brained ex-convict whose socially ambitious wife, Frenchy (Tracey Ullman), a former New Jersey stripper, harbors dreams of becoming a Manhattan hostess of wealth and culture. Ray's solution to their dire financial plight is to rent a vacant store next to a bank and set up a phony storefront business while he and his accomplices -- Denny (Michael Rapaport), Tommy (Tony Darrow) and Benny (Jon Lovitz) -- try to tunnel from the basement into the bank.</p>
        <p>Some of the movie's funniest moments observe the incompetence of these inept fools who drill into a wall only to rupture a water main. Meanwhile, upstairs, the cookie shop that Frenchy has opened unexpectedly takes off and quickly makes the Winklers wealthy beyond their wildest dreams. At this point, the movie abruptly drops its caper plot to concentrate on the Winklers' embattled ascent up the social ladder.</p>
        <p>In this middle chapter of a three-part story, Frenchy, who speaks in the same nasal cadences as Ms. Ullman's television character Fern Rosenthal, more or less takes over the movie. Pursuing her quest for higher things, this good-hearted, credulous arriviste places her dreams in the lap of David (Hugh Grant), a charming, unscrupulous art dealer whom  she employs as her Park Avenue Pygmalion.</p>
        <p>Ray soon decides he wants none of this high culture business. He'd much rather stay at home in their  tchotchke-stuffed apartment (hideous souvenir dolls line the bookcases and table surface and the living room is adorned with a huge gold harp), drink beer and play poker. As David pitches snooty high-cultural woo to Frenchy, Mr. Grant deftly imbues his character with exactly a perfect blend of charm and nasty calculation.</p>
        <p>The story takes another U-turn, and suddenly Ray and Frenchy collaborate on another robbery scheme. This time it's the theft of a priceless necklace from Chi Chi Potter (Elaine Stritch), a wealthy art patron. This final turn of the story is the most problematic part of the movie because it relies more on sitcom-ready plot twists than social satire for its humor. Mr. Allen often seems careless in the way he ends his comedies. And even for a movie as scatterbrained as this one, the outcome of ''Small Time Crooks'' feels rushed and pat.</p>
        <p>The fleeting delights have to do with its tone, its light and lovely throwaway humor, and its deftly easygoing performances. In softening his standard schlemiel to make Ray more of a stumblebum than a whiner, Mr. Allen has come up with a new, likable variation on a familiar character. Ms. Ullman's Frenchy is such a twinkling, upbeat vulgarian that you wish her discontinued HBO series, ''Tracey Takes On . . . ,'' would be revived immediately.</p>
        <p>The movie is nearly stolen by Elaine May, as Frenchy's dimwitted cousin May, who goes to work at the cookie shop and unwittingly spills the beans about the heist every time she opens her mouth. May is the kind of stubbornly eager dullard who sends guests running at a swank Manhattan party by enthusiastically burbling out the day's weather to anyone who will listen.</p>
        <p>How light is ''Small Time Crooks''? So light it makes Mr. Allen's last film, ''Sweet and Lowdown,'' seem almost Dostoyevskian by comparison. But it is also funny enough to leave you smiling.</p>
        <p>''Small Time Crooks'' is rated PG (Parental guidance suggested). It includes some mild off-color humor.</p>
