        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani withdrew from the most celebrated Senate race in the nation yesterday, saying that his health and his still-undecided treatment for prostate cancer were more important to him than his campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>In an emotional, riveting news conference, which he began in an uncharacteristically nervous voice, Mr. Giuliani said he wanted to devote his remaining 18 months in office to becoming a better mayor -- one who reaches out to minorities -- as well as becoming a better person.

        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani withdrew from the most celebrated Senate race in the nation yesterday, saying that his health and his still-undecided treatment for prostate cancer were more important to him than his campaign against Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>In an emotional, riveting news conference, which he began in an uncharacteristically nervous voice, Mr. Giuliani said he wanted to devote his remaining 18 months in office to becoming a better mayor -- one who reaches out to minorities -- as well as becoming a better person. He took his listeners along on a psychological journey, holding out the possibility that his illness had changed him.</p>
        <p>''I used to think the core of me was in politics, probably,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''It isn't. When you feel your mortality and your humanity you realize that, that the core of you is first of all being able to take care of your health.'' [Page A14]</p>
        <p>A short time later in his half-hour of remarks in the City Hall Public Hearing Room, which was crowded with more than 35 television cameras from around the world as well as hundreds of supporters, teary campaign aides, members of his administration, reporters and friends, the mayor said confronting his ''limits'' had allowed him to see himself differently. ''You realize you're not a superman and you're just a human being.''</p>
        <p>He added: ''This is not the right time for me to run for office. If it were six months ago or it were a year from now or the timing were a little different, maybe it would be different. But it isn't different and that's the way life is.''</p>
        <p>The state Republican Party reacted with sympathy, but immediately pledged support for Representative Rick A. Lazio of Long Island as the choice to replace the mayor. Party leaders said they were worried about the race but relieved that Mr. Giuliani had made a decision after weeks of reviewing his options.</p>
        <p>''I understand and respect his decision to put his health first,'' said Gov. George E. Pataki. Mr. Lazio said Mr. Giuliani ''had the best interests of New Yorkers in mind,'' and he added that he was ready to run. ''I'm looking forward to this,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's pending entry and Mr. Giuliani's withdrawal instantly changed what had been an overheated, entertaining race of national interest into a more traditional campaign. City Hall, which in recent weeks has been a jangling nerve center, settled into a new calm after the mayor left shortly after 6 p.m.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton, who telephoned the mayor shortly after his announcement, said afterward, ''I certainly hope and pray, as I know all New Yorkers do, that he will have a full and speedy recovery.'' Asked if she would miss the mayor as an opponent, Mrs. Clinton replied, ''Well, I think we should just wish him well as a person.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's campaign and City Hall staffs greeted him with a standing ovation when he entered the news conference yesterday, and applauded him when he spoke of his mayoral successes. Many have been uneasy in recent days, as the mayor's deliberations generated uncertainty at City Hall and at his campaign headquarters.</p>
        <p>At the news conference, Mr. Giuliani said he had wavered in recent days on whether to stay in the race, and had been up much of Thursday night agonizing over his decision. But he said he finally reached it yesterday morning after speaking to a few close friends. Earlier on Thursday night, he appeared at a nationally televised town hall meeting at the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan, where he gave no indication of his intentions.</p>
        <p>''When I went in last night to the town hall meeting and I saw the people outside saying, 'Run, Rudy, run, Rudy, run, Rudy,' I had, you know, half the time last night I felt like I wanted to run,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''And half the time I felt like I shouldn't do it.</p>
        <p>''I stayed up last night going back and forth about what's the right decision and what isn't the right decision. I believe this is the right decision. And I think somehow, somewhere, some way, this is all for the best.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's life has been in a near-constant state of turmoil the last three weeks, much of it recorded by a persistent and expanding press corps. On April 27, the mayor announced that he had prostate cancer. On May 3, he said he had a ''very good'' friend, Judith Nathan. On May 10, he announced that he was seeking a separation from his wife, Donna Hanover. Ms. Hanover, who was surprised by the announcement, responded that same day by announcing that the couple's troubles had begun years earlier because of a relationship between her husband and a staff member.</p>
        <p>Ms. Hanover's press secretary identified the staff member as Cristyne Lategano-Nicholas, Mr. Giuliani's former director of communications, and said Ms. Hanover believed that the relationship had been intimate. Both the mayor and Ms. Lategano-Nicholas have denied that the relationship was sexual.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Giuliani has been holding increasingly personal news conferences, in which he has ruminated openly about his life, he reached a new level of introspection with yesterday's announcement. ''I also believe that, you know, things happen in life for reasons that sometimes you only figure out afterwards,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''And there is something good that comes out of this. A lot of good things come out of it. I think I understand myself a lot better. I think I understand what's important to me better.''</p>
        <p>But that ''doesn't mean there's going to be a new Rudy,'' the mayor said, making light of his frequently combative personality. ''I think that's silly.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani also sought to redefine the remaining months of his mayoralty, promising that he would try to embrace the minority groups he has alienated in the past. His administration, he said, will try to make sure that it ''accomplishes the goal of, you know, reaching every person that we can reach and making sure that every New Yorker feels that I'm dedicated to them, that I want to protect them, that I want to help them, and that I want my time as mayor to count for everybody.''</p>
        <p>Later, he said he wanted to figure out how he had placed a ''barrier'' between his administration and the city's minority residents. He also said, abruptly, that he wanted to increase the number of people covered by health insurance because of what he has been through. ''One of the things that I felt from the beginning of this and continue to feel is a tremendous sense of compassion for the people that have to make decisions like this alone,'' he said. ''One of the things maybe that I can do is figure out how we accelerate making sure that people are covered -- I mean, there are a lot of things that I think I can accomplish that I haven't accomplished before.''</p>
        <p>C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, who has been a frequent critic of the mayor, said that she was ''very hopeful that he will, indeed, work to overcome the many barriers that face too many New Yorkers.'' The Rev. Al Sharpton, one of Mr. Giuliani's most vociferous critics, said that he wished Mr. Giuliani well, but that he did not see his withdrawal from the race ''as a political loss for the people of the state.'' Mr. Sharpton also said that he was now more inclined to run for mayor in 2001.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Giuliani had repeatedly said in the days after announcing his illness that he would first make a decision on his cancer treatment and then decide on the race, he said yesterday that his thinking had been flawed.</p>
        <p>''I didn't organize this,'' he said. ''I mean, I didn't understand the impact of this. It was, what I thought at first was, O.K., I'll take a week or two, or three, whatever it takes, to figure out what the treatment is. I will then decide on the treatment, I'll then look at the treatment and I'll figure out, does that mean I can run or I can't run.'' Mr. Giuliani added, ''I know it sounds silly, but I thought of it like a budget decision or a legal decision.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Giuliani said the decision, which could be either surgery to remove the prostate or radiation, had turned out to be far more difficult than he ever imagined -- in part, he said on Thursday, because of possible side effects. Although surgery is the choice of most men of Mr. Giuliani's age, which is 55, and has a high cure rate, it also causes impotence and incontinence in many patients. Doctors say that radiation, particularly in the form of ''seeds'' inserted into the prostate, has less effect on sexual function, but its long-term cure rates are not known.</p>
        <p>Although doctors said that Mr. Giuliani would have been physically able to continue in the race no matter what treatment he chose -- if he was willing to campaign part time over the summer -- Mr. Giuliani said yesterday that he did not want to run a race when he was not operating at 100 percent.</p>
        <p>''My concentration isn't going to be there,'' he said. He added that ''nobody can tell you in percentages what the side effects are going to be. You can be fine, you can be terrific, or you can have problems and then you won't be able to carry out your commitment.''</p>
        <p>The mayor said that he would continue to mull over his treatment options in the coming weeks, and that his decision would not be ''a political matter'' but a personal one. He said again, as he has repeatedly, that his decision not to run was based on his health, not on his unraveling marriage or personal problems.</p>
        <p>Joannie Danielides, Ms. Hanover's press secretary, said that the mayor telephoned his wife and informed her of his decision shortly before his announcement. Ms. Hanover recently hired Helene Brezinsky, a prominent Manhattan divorce lawyer.</p>
        <p>Both Ms. Hanover and Mr. Giuliani are living at Gracie Mansion while they work out a separation agreement.</p>
        <p>''They talked briefly,'' Ms. Danielides said. ''She's concerned for his health and will try to help him with that.''</p>
        <p>Before he made his announcement, Mr. Giuliani also informed Mr. Pataki; William D. Powers, the state Republican Party chairman; Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader; Senator John McCain and Gov. George W. Bush, whom Mr. Giuliani endorsed for president.</p>
        <p>''I told Rudy that I understood it was a very difficult decision for him to make, and our prayers are with him,'' Mr. Bush said. ''He is my friend whether he's the candidate or not for the United States Senate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani told his staff of his decision shortly after his 11 a.m. radio call-in show on Friday, when senior members of his administration could be seen moving in and out of his office with grim faces. A short walk away, on Maiden Lane, the site of the Giuliani campaign headquarters, young volunteers were devastated. Bruce J. Teitelbaum, Mr. Giuliani's campaign manager, who had privately and consistently worried that Mr. Giuliani would withdraw, said he would go on vacation, and he began turning requests for interviews with the mayor over to Mr. Giuliani's City Hall press secretary, Sunny Mindel. ''The campaign is effectively over,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Giuliani said that he was ''pretty sure'' of his decision even before the radio show, he did not let on, even during a long, melancholy response to ''Eileen in Queens,'' who had called to say that she would vote for Mr. Giuliani, but not for Mr. Lazio if the mayor dropped out.</p>
        <p>The mayor thanked her, then said: ''Believe me, if you have ever faced a decision like this, you realize it is much deeper, it is much more difficult, it involves many more parts of you, involves every part of you, actually. And it involves you really calculating what are the most important things in your life.''</p>
        <p>At the close of Mr. Giuliani's announcement, a reporter asked the mayor if he felt closer to God.</p>
        <p>''I hope he's closer to me,'' he replied.</p>
