        <p>This 30-second commercial, titled ''Only Bill Gormley,'' was released yesterday by State Senator William L. Gormley of New Jersey in his campaign for the Republican nomination for United States Senate. It is being broadcast by television stations in New York. Philadelphia stations will run a slightly different version, ''South Jersey's Own,'' which notes that Mr. Gormley is a native of South Jersey and has spent decades representing the region.</p>

        <p>This 30-second commercial, titled ''Only Bill Gormley,'' was released yesterday by State Senator William L. Gormley of New Jersey in his campaign for the Republican nomination for United States Senate. It is being broadcast by television stations in New York. Philadelphia stations will run a slightly different version, ''South Jersey's Own,'' which notes that Mr. Gormley is a native of South Jersey and has spent decades representing the region.</p>
        <p>PRODUCER</p>
        <p>Stevens, Reed, Curcio</p>
        <p>ON THE SCREEN</p>
        <p>The ad intersperses scenes of Mr. Gormley chatting with middle-class citizens in leafy suburbs, working in his office and being honored by Gov. Christine Todd Whitman. As the narrator discusses Mr. Gormley's military record, the ad shows a photo of a youthful Mr. Gormley, dressed in his Marine blues, flashing a gung-ho smile. In every scene the skies are sunny, Mr. Gormley appears genial and his listeners seem enthralled.</p>
        <p>THE SCRIPT</p>
        <p>''Only Bill Gormley was a captain in the Marines and has a reputation for integrity. Only Bill Gormley voted for 14 balanced state budgets and cut more than $1 billion in wasteful spending from Florio's budget. Only Bill Gormley voted to cut taxes 37 times, and he voted against Florio's $2.8 billion tax hike. In fact, only Bill Gormley was praised by Governor Whitman as 'a nonstop advocate for tax cuts.' That's why Bill Gormley is the only Republican New Jersey taxpayers can trust.''</p>
        <p>ACCURACY</p>
        <p>The ad carefully highlights the most fiscally conservative votes of a legislator who is widely considered one of New Jersey's most moderate Republicans. Mrs. Whitman did indeed praise Mr. Gormley's tax-cutting record, but she has also praised his chief opponent, Representative Bob Franks, saying that ''he fought for lower taxes and against wasteful spending.'' The governor said that both Mr. Franks and Mr. Gormley would make excellent senators, and that she did not intend to endorse either in the primary.</p>
        <p>SCORECARD</p>
        <p>With this commercial, Mr. Gormley introduces himself as a sunny, fiscally prudent, patriotic lawmaker, while simultaneously deflecting attacks from his opponents. The emphasis on budget consciousness and tax cuts is intended to rebut charges that Mr. Gormley and other legislators are responsible for adding billions in pork-barrel spending to the state's school construction plan. By highlighting Mr. Gormley's opposition to Jim Florio, a Democrat, the ad also rebuts charges by Mr. Franks that Mr. Gormley is a ''Florio Republican'' working too closely with the former governor.</p>
