        <p>Annette Lu says Taiwan is an ''independent sovereign state.'' She thinks President Clinton ought to invite the leaders of Taiwan and China to hash out their differences at the White House. And when asked whether there are two Chinas -- a proposition that outrages Beijing and sends most officials here into semantic contortions -- she does not miss a beat: ''I would say so.''</p>
        <p>Is it any wonder that the new  government of the president-elect,  Chen Shui-bian, seems eager to silence its outspoken vice president-elect?</p>
        <p>In an interview here on Monday, Ms. Lu, 56, offered opinions on everything from relations between Taiwan and China to relations between men and women. She was unrepentant about having described the two countries in a previous interview as ''distant relatives and close neighbors.'' That phrase drew a toxic reaction from Beijing, which denounced Ms. Lu as ''scum,'' bent on promoting Taiwan's independence.</p>
        <p>''I did not do anything wrong, I did not say anything wrong,'' said Ms. Lu in a gentle voice by turns somber and playful. ''For China, being such a big nation, to choose a woman to be the target! All of a sudden, I became famous. I don't deserve that much.''</p>
        <p>On Saturday, Ms. Lu will be sworn in as Taiwan's first female vice president. She is half of the team that swept the Nationalist Party from power after more than a half century of rule. And by her own reckoning, she is the first woman to be elected to a leadership position in 5,000 years of Chinese history.</p>
        <p>With so much history hanging over Ms. Lu, her description of her career has all the elements of an epic narrative. A native Taiwanese and feminist leader, she was once thrown in jail for five and a half years by the Nationalist government after being charged with advocating Taiwan's independence. Now, on the eve of her inauguration, she is being tarred by the Chinese leaders on the very same issue.</p>
        <p>''They've accused me of what the KMT accused me of 20 years ago,'' said Ms. Lu, using the initials for the Nationalist Party's Chinese name, Kuomintang. ''Twenty years later, the same party who suppressed me is ready to have its regime transferred to me on behalf of the freedom fighters.''</p>
        <p>Other members of the new administration are quick to note that power is being transferred to President-elect Chen, a careful politician who has labored since the election in March to soothe China's leaders on the question of Taiwan's independence. Although Mr. Chen's party, the Democratic Progressive Party, formally calls for independence, he says it is an unnecessary step.</p>
        <p>Since his election, Mr. Chen has proposed to lift limits on Taiwanese investment in China and to discuss direct trade links with the mainland. He has also steered clear of pronouncements on the role of the United States in the standoff between the countries. Ms. Lu's oft-repeated suggestion that Washington act as a mediator has rankled senior officials in the new government.</p>
        <p>''Our forthcoming vice president spoke her mind again on this issue,'' said the foreign minister-designate, Tien Hung-mao, in an interview. ''The fact of the matter is, this is not official policy.''</p>
        <p>Other people are harsher. ''She's a loose cannon,'' said Andrew Yang, head of the Chinese Council of Advanced Policy Studies, a research institute. ''She doesn't share the same political beliefs as Chen Shui-bian. She sees herself as the guardian of the Taiwanese independence movement.''</p>
        <p>The problem for officials like Mr. Tien is that Ms. Lu regards foreign affairs as her area of expertise. A lawyer with degrees from the University of Illinois and Harvard, Ms. Lu has led Taiwan's unsuccessful battle to be readmitted to the United Nations. Her resume lists visits over the years to South Africa, Nicaragua, Ireland and the Netherlands.</p>
        <p>''At the beginning of the campaign, people expected me to be active in foreign affairs and mainland affairs,'' she said. ''It all depends on where President Chen would like me to help.''</p>
        <p>Shiow-Jen Chang, a woman in Parliament who knows Ms. Lu, remembers the energy and imagination that she brought to Taiwan's quixotic effort to re-enter the United Nations. In 1997, Ms. Lu arranged for a blimp with a flashing sign to fly over the United Nations building, while a boat carrying another sign floated past on the East River and a pro-Taiwanese crowd paraded on the street outside.</p>
        <p>''Every year she proposed a different way to enter the U.N.,'' Ms. Chang said. ''She doesn't care how people will react. She says and does exactly what she believes.''</p>
        <p>Analysts say Mr. Chen's senior advisers are moving to marginalize Ms. Lu even before she is sworn in. During Ms. Lu's interview on Monday, no aides were present -- an odd practice for the future No. 2 official of a country. And she said she would not be involved in drafting Mr. Chen's inauguration speech because it will be subjected to such intense scrutiny in Beijing.</p>
        <p>''I want the P.R.C. authorities to understand that it is useless to target me,'' she said.</p>
        <p>As for the rumors that she was being frozen out, Ms. Lu said they were planted by people, here and in mainland China, who want to drive a wedge between her and Mr. Chen. The rise of an outspoken woman, she said, was bound to ruffle feathers on both sides of the strait.</p>
        <p>''Among the internal circle of power, they are not ready yet,'' Ms. Lu said with smile of someone who has been there before. ''But they are getting ready.''</p>
