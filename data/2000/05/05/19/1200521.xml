        <p>All Parts of Italy</p>
        <p>In a city saturated with Italian restaurants, New Yorkers have a wealth of trattorias, ristorantes and osterias to choose from with virtually every region of Italy represented. While there are many outstanding ones -- and everyone has a favorite -- here are a dozen that offer exceptional fare. (These summaries are taken from dining reviews, columns and articles in The Times by William Grimes, Eric Asimov and others.)</p>
        <p>1. Babbo</p>
        <p>*** [3 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 777-0303</p>
        <p>110 Waverly Place</p>
        <p>Greenwich Village</p>
        <p>$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>The menu at this spare and casual trattoria is loaded with dishes that Americans are not supposed to like. Fresh anchovies and warm testa (that's headcheese) are among the appetizers, and pastas include maccheroni alla chitarra with oven-dried tomatoes, red chilies and bottarga muggine, and ravioli filled with beef cheeks and topped with crushed squab livers. A big bowl of squid constitutes one main course, and sweetbreads with bacon is another. Lambs' tongues and calf's brains are frequent specials. When many restaurants take no chances and menus are made by focus groups, Babbo is a breath of fresh air. The pastas are universally impressive, the calamari is fabulous and the largely Italian wine list is unusual and fairly priced. It would be easy to overlook desserts, but don't. They are excellent and, with choices like saffron panna cotta with rhubarb marmellata and rhubarb sorbetto, as unusual as everything else.</p>
        <p>2. Bricco</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 245-7160</p>
        <p>304 West 56th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Bricco offers enough unusual twists on the basic Italian restaurant formula to keep you intrigued and eager for more, like an appetizer of fresh anchovies the size of sardines, marinated but still firm and slightly briny. Other excellent appetizers include tiny tender clams in a white wine and garlic broth and grilled rings of calamari with mushrooms sauteed with rosemary and garlic. Bricco offers a small selection of pastas, including some superb choices, like penne in a lively sauce of eggplant, tomato, pine nuts and mozzarella, and rigatoni in a gentle but delicious sauce of mushrooms, artichokes, cream and white wine. Don't count on Bricco for tranquillity; the dining room, with its low ceiling, tile floor and a brick wall, amplifies the noise. Bricco has a second branch, Bricco 22, at 46 West 22nd Street in the Flatiron district.</p>
        <p>3. Chianti</p>
        <p>** [2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 980-8686</p>
        <p>1043 Second Avenue, at 55th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>This ambitious neighborhood restaurant has a talented chef who is eager to strut his stuff. Some of the appetizers are extraordinary, like roasted wild mushrooms with creamy polenta and Parmesan, and braised boneless short ribs set on a bed of farro (a grain similar to barley). Risottos are excellent, spaghetti with tomato sauce is made with respect, and there are almost always interesting specials like orecchiette tossed with chickpeas, crisp bits of pancetta, wilted dandelion greens and cheese. Fish like orata, pompano and stripped bass are roasted whole on a cedar plank. Chicken is moist and crisp, and the veal chop is excellent. Service is fine, but the seating is not quite as luxurious as the food. The wine list has recently been changed and now offers about 70 selections with more inexpensive offerings than before.</p>
        <p>4. Cinque Terre</p>
        <p>** [2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 213-0910</p>
        <p>22 East 38th Street</p>
        <p>Murray Hill</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>While northern Italian dishes seem to have conquered the city, Cinque Terre offers something different: a menu of rarer Ligurian specialties. Not one of the pasta dishes, for example, is based on tomatoes. Pansotti con salsa di noci, big triangles of pasta stuffed with ricotta, greens and herbs, is irresistible in its rich walnut sauce, and the pesto, served over trenette and diced potatoes and string beans, is particularly good here. Fish dishes include grilled Mediterranean dorade royale. The wine list and the dessert list are both excellent.</p>
        <p>5. Da Antonio</p>
        <p>++</p>
        <p>(212) 588-1545</p>
        <p>157 East 55th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>The pastas are superb at this gracious, quietly dignified restaurant. Agnolotti stuffed with sausages and broccoli rape is particularly good; the big rustic pockets of pasta are not only filled with the flavorful mixture but topped with it also. Service is lovely; the owner, Antonio Cerra, hands you a large Italian menu and leaves you to peruse it. When he returns to tell you about the specials, he does more than recite a long list; he describes each dish. You can almost dine on his enthusiasm. Da Antonio now offers live music nightly.</p>
        <p>6. Follonico</p>
        <p>** [2 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 691-6359</p>
        <p>6 West 24th Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>Follonico's chef and owner, Alan Tardi, cooks stripped-down Tuscan fare notable for its eloquent flavors, its simplicity and its reliance on seasonal ingredients. His pastas are superb, like pappardelle with braised rabbit, black olives, rosemary and tomato. Fazzoletti, ''handkerchiefs'' of pasta, are made with herbs in the dough so they look like flowered prints and are served on a tasty ragu of seafood. Main courses are refreshingly straightforward: a small chicken baked in Follonico's wood-burning oven and served with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables; red snapper in rock salt served with Yukon gold potatoes, sauteed spinach, herbed pesto sauce and tomato coulis; and a porterhouse steak, very charred, with grilled zucchini and roasted onions. Follonico's wine list is unusual and reasonable.</p>
        <p>7. Gennaro</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 665-5348</p>
        <p>665 Amsterdam Avenue, near 93rd Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$ Cash only</p>
        <p>Each night crowds line up outside Gennaro Piccone's humble storefront, which is not much more than a narrow candle-lit aisle with some inexpensive wood paneling and a cement floor painted maroon. As they wait, the aromas of bread, olive oil, rosemary and basil are mouthwatering hints of Mr. Piccone's lusty, full-flavored food, which asks not so much to be admired as to be eaten. Pastas are carefully assembled and well flavored, like orecchiette with broccoli and provolone, and plump tortelloni stuffed with spinach and ricotta in a butter and sage sauce. But the real star of the show is the fabulous osso buco, a short veal shank that is beautifully presented, crusted with cubes of tomato, onion, carrot and herbs, scented with rosemary, garlic and lemon and oozing with marrow.</p>
        <p>8. Luca</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 987-9260</p>
        <p>1712 First Avenue, near 89th Street</p>
        <p>Yorkville</p>
        <p>$ Visa and Mastercard</p>
        <p>If you think antipasto selections are dull and repetitious, this bustling neighborhood restaurant may change your mind. The antipasto for two is astounding, with wonderful sauteed radicchio flavored with sweet balsamic vinegar; glazed chicken livers, earthy and rich, on toast; grilled portobello mushrooms; tangy marinated eggplant; splendid grilled squid, and much, much more. But the antipasto is not all that's good at Luca. Pastas are terrific, like bigoli al ragu d'agnello, round Venetian pasta that Luca Marcato, the chef and owner, makes himself, served with a full, rich lamb sauce. This pasta is also excellent with a buttery shrimp-and-radicchio sauce, made with chunks of tomato, white wine and onions. Butterflied Cornish hen is crisp and juicy. Luca's house-made granita, in flavors like almond and grapefruit, is superb.</p>
        <p>9. Ribollita</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 982-0975</p>
        <p>260 Park Avenue South, near 21st Street</p>
        <p>$ American Express</p>
        <p>With its mishmash of stone archways and log beams, Ribollita looks the part of a country trattoria. The food, too, offers the sort of rustic, hearty flavors that are so easy to enjoy yet so hard to find, as if its kitchen were filled with loving Italian grandmothers. Tart, oozy stracchino cheese wrapped in a thin slice of ham, drizzled with truffle oil and served over toast, is a wonderfully satisfying dish, while polenta with Gorgonzola is like delicious baby food. The pastas are simple and direct, like the wonderful crespelle, a delicate pasta crepe layered with ricotta, spinach and fresh tomatoes, and main courses include spicy marinated Cornish game hen, flattened and roasted with garlic and rosemary.</p>
        <p>10. San Domenico</p>
        <p>*** [3 stars]</p>
        <p>(212) 265-5959</p>
        <p>240 Central Park South</p>
        <p>$$$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>One of the handful of American restaurants trying to showcase the cooking of the aristocratic Italian kitchen, San Domenico serves food that is far more ambitious than that of the average Italian restaurant. And far more rewarding. The restaurant's signature dish is uovo in ravioli al burro nocciola tartufato: a single large puff of ravioli filled with ricotta and spinach perfumed with truffle butter. Snuggled inside is an egg that spurts golden yolk onto the plate as you begin to eat. Garganelli, hand-rolled penne, come tossed with caviar and chives. But the kitchen does not need luxury ingredients to show its stuff. The simple spaghetti alla chitarra, in a tomato and basil sauce, is like no spaghetti you have ever tasted.</p>
        <p>11. ViceVersa</p>
        <p>* [1 star]</p>
        <p>(212) 399-9291</p>
        <p>325 West 51st Street</p>
        <p>Manhattan</p>
        <p>$$ All major cards</p>
        <p>With its crisp earth-colored awnings and gleaming facade, ViceVersa stands out on one of Manhattan's grungier blocks like a Versace suit. Inside, the decor, chaste and pure, is so minimal that it seems to disappear in the course of an evening, a blur of light beige walls, dark hardwood floors and stately antique terra-cotta vases. The menu, too, is honest and unpretentious, a solid lineup of mostly northern Italian dishes presented in a perfectly straightforward manner. Casoncelli alla bergamasca, a specialty that the chef, Stefano Terzi, has brought from his hometown of Bergamo, near Milan, stands out among the pasta dishes. It is ravioli filled with chopped veal, crushed amaretto cookies, raisins and Parmesan, topped with butter, crisped sage leaves and fried pancetta -- a salty, herbal sauce that offsets the sweetness of the stuffing. Veal medallions coated with a Parmesan and caper breading are thick and juicy, but for flavorful simplicity, it would be hard to top the tender slices of beef loin coated in a rich, vibrant sauce of balsamic vinegar and shallots.</p>
        <p>12. Le Zie</p>
        <p>+</p>
        <p>(212) 206-8686</p>
        <p>172 Seventh Avenue,</p>
        <p>near 20th Street</p>
        <p>Chelsea</p>
        <p>$ Cash only</p>
        <p>This modest little trattoria offers some terrific Venetian dishes, like octopus with potatoes, an inspired salad, with the pliant octopus and the soft potatoes acting in precise textural counterpoint. The chef has a sure hand with pastas like rigatoni with rosemary, served al dente in a perfectly proportioned sauce of ground veal and rosemary. Risotto with squid is also superbly cooked. Striped bass filet with fennel and string beans is moist and wonderfully flavorful, while a whole red snapper baked in salt and then filleted at the table, shows that the simplest preparation -- it's sprinkled with olive oil, lemon and herbs -- can do wonders in showing off the fish.</p>
