        <p>STANLEY SHOPKORN is sailing away from the stock market. But you can bet he'll be back.</p>
        <p>The 57-year-old Mr. Shopkorn has been a masterful stock trader for longer than many of today's money managers have been alive. He's made money in bull markets and in bear markets. (He's also lost money in both, but mostly he's been on the right side.)</p>
        <p>Most important, he helped save Wall Street in its darkest hour. We'll get to that later.</p>
        <p>When word spread this week that Mr. Shopkorn was taking a sabbatical -- he'll spend the summer cruising the Mediterranean with his wife; his son, who is graduating from college; and his daughter, who is finishing a graduate degree -- there was a tendency to assume another star had been shot down by this year's crazy stock market. But it evidently isn't so. Details on his performance are not available, because he runs the equity part of the $10 billion in hedge funds managed by Moore Capital, and those figures are not broken out from overall returns, but he seems to have done all right. This is not a case of a grizzled veteran who has lost touch with the markets and now sits around blaming the markets for being unreasonable.</p>
        <p>He's done well over the years in part because he usually has a view about where the economy is heading and what the big market theme is likely to be. But he also has a profound respect for the markets, and an ability to read the screen -- we used to say read the tape, but there is no tape anymore -- and sense when it  isn't wise to play a trend.</p>
        <p>In the early 1980's, when he was running the block trading desk at Salomon Brothers, he made lots of money shorting oil stocks on the way down after they reached historic levels of overvaluation. More recently, he did well buying such stocks, and he still thinks that companies specializing in oil and gas exploration are cheap, and that the price of natural gas is headed up. He got on the technology bandwagon early, and he thinks that game is not over, although future rallies are likely to be more selective in terms of quality. He hopes, but is not certain, that the Federal Reserve will be able to arrange an economic soft landing that will not devastate markets.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shopkorn will reassess his future come fall. In the meantime, he'll leave some of his money in funds run by people he trusts, and put the rest in short-term Treasuries.</p>
        <p>His finest hour came on Oct. 20, 1987, the day after Black Monday, when the Dow industrials fell 23 percent. An early rally faded, and the New York Stock Exchange halted trading in stock after stock as sell orders poured in. Fear abounded, and it seemed likely that America's financial markets were about to close for lack of buyers.</p>
        <p>It was then that Mr. Shopkorn, the head trader at Salomon, took a call from Robert Mnuchin, his counterpart at Goldman, Sachs. They agreed that the two firms -- then the most powerful ones in stock trading -- would provide the money to reopen stocks that had halted. Within minutes of that word being sent to the Big Board floor, the market began to rally. You can't prove that decision was crucial to ending the crash, but I believe it was.</p>
        <p>Yesterday I asked Mr. Shopkorn why he had decided to risk Salomon's capital at just that point. The trader wasn't about to admit to being a good Samaritan. ''I thought we were making a good market play,'' he said. ''We thought that it would bounce, and that people just needed capital.''</p>
        <p>But then he paused. ''We thought we were helping the system as well,'' he said.</p>
