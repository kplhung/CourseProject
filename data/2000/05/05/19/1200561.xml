        <p>Yvonne Borree and Peter Boal are the latest Princess Aurora and Prince Desire to step into ''The Sleeping Beauty'' that the New York City Ballet is presenting through Sunday afternoon.</p>
        <p>At that matinee, Christopher Wheeldon will supposedly dance with the company for the last time. At the ripe old age of 28, he is retiring from the stage to devote himself to choreography. Enormously gifted, he may be taking the right step. One will miss the classical stylishness he brought from the Royal Ballet in Britain to his dancing at the New York State Theater.</p>
        <p>Especially typical is the engaging eagerness he still showed as a cavalier in the Rose Adagio in this staging of ''The Sleeping Beauty'' by Peter Martins. Ms. Borree did not respond in kind. Her dancing with four cavaliers lacked exhilaration and a grand scale.</p>
        <p>Her sweet and modest Aurora, however, had been full of promise in her first solo. Her technique was acceptable but then became progressively uneven by the second solo. In the ''vision'' scene of the second act, she was more at home in a quicksilver Romantic image. But by the pas de deux of the wedding, the impression was that she had learned a role and then failed to develop it.</p>
        <p>The prince has less to dance but Mr. Boal gave him a good pedigree. Unusually polite to his courtiers and Kathleen Tracey's streamlined Lilac Fairy, he erupted with the elation of newfound love in his solo in Act II and stayed on the same exciting level in the wedding scene. The double air turns into arabesque were perfectly placed.</p>
        <p>Debuts in a few roles were happy ones. In the prologue, Ellen Bar may be the only one in the company to give power and refinement to the difficult ''finger'' solo for the Fairy of Courage. She does not blur the steps. Dena Abergel had clarity and energy in the first variation. Jeroen Hofmans's soft landings and opulent style made his dancing in the ''Jewels'' divertissement a pleasure. Maurice Kaplow conducted.</p>
