        <p>Whether Agnes Martin's new stripe paintings are works of transcendentalist beauty or of sensory deprivation depends on what beliefs viewers bring to them. Each canvas is a pale five-foot square bearing horizontal bands of watery color separated by penciled lines. Ms. Martin's iconic persona, her reputation for mystic spirituality and titles like ''Happiness-Glee,'' ''Lovely Life'' and ''I Love the Whole World'' encourage discovery of a kind of pantheistically charged aesthetic resonance. Taken on their own, however, these paintings do not generate much visual excitement.</p>
        <p>To her credit, Ms. Martin, who is 88 and lives in New Mexico, has always eschewed ingratiating effects. At best, however, her Minimalist rectitude has been enlivened by inventive patterning and an exquisite touch. In this show, ''I Love Love,'' with its alternating narrow bands of orange and blue, produces a compelling optical hum. But the other compositions of blue, orange or yellow stripes in varying combinations of widths on white canvas seem monotonous, their colors dingy and washed out, their surfaces nondescript.</p>

        <p>To her credit, Ms. Martin, who is 88 and lives in New Mexico, has always eschewed ingratiating effects.

        <p>It is possible to experience in these paintings a shimmering luminosity. The way the pencil lines always end a quarter-inch short of the canvas edge somehow produces the illusion of a haloed circumference. One may imagine a Rothkoesque divinity animating the earthly physicality of the canvas.</p>
        <p>But whether one actually experiences such immanence will be as much a matter of faith as of taste.</p>
