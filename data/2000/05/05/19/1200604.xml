        <p>Facing water leaks, faulty heating and holes in their walls, the residents of 1420 Grand Concourse, a Bronx building with 138 apartments, did for years what most tenants in the city do when something needs to be fixed. They called for maintenance.</p>
        <p>When the problems persisted, several tenants said, residents of the building long ago resorted to unorthodox and confrontational tactics to get the landlord to listen: they organized into a tenant union, held street protests, gave press tours of their building and occupied the management company's offices. And they saw results, winning a meeting with top officials of the company, the Rosenberg Diamond Development Corporation, and getting repairs done more quickly.</p>

        <p>Facing water leaks, faulty heating and holes in their walls, the residents of 1420 Grand Concourse, a Bronx building with 138 apartments, did for years what most tenants in the city do when something needs to be fixed. They called for maintenance.</p>
        <p>When the problems persisted, several tenants said, residents of the building long ago resorted to unorthodox and confrontational tactics to get the landlord to listen: they organized into a tenant union, held street protests, gave press tours of their building and occupied the management company's offices. And they saw results, winning a meeting with top officials of the company, the Rosenberg Diamond Development Corporation, and getting repairs done more quickly.</p>
        <p>Then came the hard part -- staying together, staying organized, keeping the pressure up -- hurdles that usually end the tough talk and high aims of tenant groups. Some people in the building, afraid that management might try to evict them for their activism, dropped out. Others quit after the work in their homes was completed. And some left the group because Rosenberg Diamond promised to keep upgrading.</p>
        <p>''I guess they thought we didn't mean business,'' said Luis De Jesus, 30, a longtime resident and one of the tenant leaders. ''They thought they'd shut us down after a little patch-up work on the apartments.''</p>
        <p>But today, three years after they formed, the small but vocal group of tenants from the building on the corner of East 171st Street is still pushing for more repairs and helping the tenants of four other Rosenberg Diamond buildings to organize. Yesterday, with the help of Bronx Acorn, a community group that helps tenants fight for improved housing, they led reporters on a tour of dirty hallways and shabby apartments in four of the buildings.</p>
        <p>''They just have a gift, and there isn't someone like that in every building you go to,'' said Heather Appel, a member of Acorn who has been helping tenants of the five buildings organize. ''They got into negotiations and won a lot of renovations and then felt everything stopped, and they weren't satisfied, and that's kept them going.''</p>
        <p>Officials from Rosenberg Diamond, owners of 49 buildings in the Bronx, disputed the tenants' assertions. ''They have not forced Rosenberg Diamond to their knees, as they claim,'' said Manuel E. Carcano, vice president and general manager for the company. ''These are repairs that were planned and methodical.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Carcano said that with a $1.3 million loan from the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, the company replaced the roof and boiler at 1420 Grand Concourse in recent months. Millions more, he said, have been spent to upgrade the other buildings and to make routine repairs. ''We love to put in new kitchens and bathrooms,'' said Mr. Carcano. ''We love the way people react when they get brand-new bathrooms and kitchens.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, some tenants of Rosenberg Diamond properties praise management. ''I really don't have any complaints,'' said Alyza Torres, who lives at 3201-3213 Park Avenue, one of the five buildings where tenants are organizing. ''If I have a problem I call in the morning, and they're there later in the day.''</p>
        <p>At 1420 Grand Concourse, tenant leaders maintained that repairmen were still slow to respond, and that repairs tended to be inadequate. A tour of their building revealed cracked stairs, a steel plate serving as a stairwell landing, holes in walls and, in one apartment, the smell of a dead rodent behind a wall. Organizers noted that some residents paid $700 or more a month for an apartment.</p>
        <p>The tenant leaders vowed to keep organizing with Acorn's help. And that means working with tenants in the four other Rosenberg Diamond buildings to become a stronger organization to pressure management.</p>
        <p>''We need to unite, to get stronger,'' said Lourdes Ghamandi, a 20-year resident of 1420 Grand Concourse who videotapes problems in the building. ''Our strategy is to unite with everyone who is in a Rosenberg Diamond building.''</p>
        <p>The tenants of 1420, to be sure, know about small victories, defeats and how to move on.</p>
        <p>When they first started meeting, tenant leaders recalled, as many as 40 residents would show up. Soon, they were protesting at Rosenberg Diamond's offices at 1919 Williamsbridge Road. ''If we put up a flier saying we were going to get together because they don't fix anything, in the morning workers would be fixing here, fixing there,'' said Ms. Ghamandi, a home-care attendant and the mother of two boys.</p>
        <p>But organizing can be trying. Leaders have to knock on doors, to make sure that people attend meetings. Logs recording problems in the building must be kept up to date. And defections from the group have left the organization with just a core group of 10 or 15 active tenants.</p>
        <p>''People will say, I'll join; I'll go,'' said Daisy Hidalgo, an active resident in the group whose apartment is filled with holes, stained walls and uneven floors. ''But when the time comes, people say: 'Well, they'll raise my rent. They'll throw us out.' ''</p>
        <p>Still, the tenant leaders of 1420 Grand Concourse are being heard and emulated by budding organizers in the four other buildings, who have discussed tactics with Ms. Ghamandi, Mr. De Jesus and others.</p>
        <p>''They inspired us,'' said Rosa Sierra, 31, an office manager and mother of four who lives at 3201-3213 Park Avenue. ''They inspired me for sure. Everything that they told us, we tried to do the same things here.''</p>
        <p>Ceida Torres, who has lived at 1350 Grand Concourse for 19 years, said she thought the example set by her neighbors at 1420 was a ''good way to get things to happen.''</p>
        <p>''I liked hearing about their fight and what they had done,'' she said, ''and I decided I wanted to do it, too.''</p>
