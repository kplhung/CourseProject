        <p>HERE we are, confronting the same old same old at Kutsher's Country Club: an elderly man is sound asleep in the lobby, while two women with no intention of spilling their age paddle across the indoor pool like a pair of spandex tugboats. Outside, the golfers ponder their divots. Helen Kutsher, who can spot a tarnished fork from 50 paces, is on hostess patrol, as she's been for the past half century, and her 52-year-old son, Mark, who runs the place, is solving the mystery of the missing tile in the men's health center.</p>
        <p>Solution: Buy more tile. When you've just optioned the family business to a conglomerate that intends to build a $1 billion casino and 2,000-room ''destination resort'' on 50 spare acres of your property, what's a little extra tile? After all, if it's your name spelled in cute script on the entrance, on the napkins, on the kosher menus, on everything, you've got an image to uphold no matter who eventually ends up owning things -- right, Mr. Kutsher?</p>

        <p>HERE we are, confronting the same old same old at Kutsher's Country Club: an elderly man is sound asleep in the lobby, while two women with no intention of spilling their age paddle across the indoor pool like a pair of spandex tugboats. Outside, the golfers ponder their divots. Helen Kutsher, who can spot a tarnished fork from 50 paces, is on hostess patrol, as she's been for the past half century, and her 52-year-old son, Mark, who runs the place, is solving the mystery of the missing tile in the men's health center.</p>
        <p>Solution: Buy more tile. When you've just optioned the family business to a conglomerate that intends to build a $1 billion casino and 2,000-room ''destination resort'' on 50 spare acres of your property, what's a little extra tile? After all, if it's your name spelled in cute script on the entrance, on the napkins, on the kosher menus, on everything, you've got an image to uphold no matter who eventually ends up owning things -- right, Mr. Kutsher?</p>
        <p>So until the casino gives patrons a 24-hour-a-day way to pass their time and part with their money, Mr. Kutsher is making sure there's the traditional bevy of (free) options on the daily activity list: An Outdoor Power Walk With Krazy Tyrone! The Best Of Line and Folk Dancing With Hedy! Seminar: It's Not What You Earn, It's What You Keep That Counts! Bingo A.M.: Win! Win! Win! A Day at the Races With Tom Barry: Come Place Your Bets!</p>
        <p>Hey, speaking of betting. . . .</p>
        <p>Kutsher's has always been ahead of the Catskills learning curve: first to exist, first to play host to Rocky Marciano, first to hire Jerry Seinfeld and Andy Kaufman, first with the indoor pool and a Sports Academy with celebrity instructors like Wilt Chamberlain. Now, with a little help from the St. Regis Mohawk Indians and Park Place Entertainment, Mr. Kutsher, who became a bellhop the minute he ''was old enough to carry a suitcase,'' intends to make his resort the first to bring casino gambling to the struggling borscht belt.</p>
        <p>What good, after all, is greenery without greenbacks? Not much. Not if you're trying to avoid the fate of your peers: Grossinger's and the Concord were sold in bankruptcy court last year. The Kutshers never contemplated closing their 1,400-acre semblance of Shangri-La, but Mr. Kutsher, at the helm since his father, Milton, died in 1998, has lobbied for legalized gambling for 20 years.</p>
        <p>And for the last four, he's conducted quiet conversations with Park Place, owner of 28 gambling operations including the Paris, the one that knocked his socks off when he went to Las Vegas to inspect it.</p>
        <p>''How can we compete with that?'' he asks. ''We can't! And then we've got Atlantic City and Connecticut beating our heads in because they offer things we don't!'' The only way to level the playing field, he says, is to bring casinos to the Catskills, preferably to his doorstep. That the Mohawks had a deal with Catskill Development for a casino at Monticello Raceway when Park Place made its pitch doesn't worry him.</p>
        <p>''Not that I'm a hero, but maybe I saved the situation,'' he says, hinting the much-disputed Park Place deal makes more fiscal sense for the Mohawks, the county and the state. ''Park Place has a track record as the biggest and best.''</p>
        <p>MR. KUTSHER admits there probably hasn't been an Indian on Kutsher property since ''the 17- or 1800's when somebody took it away from them.''</p>
        <p>''It wasn't you or me, but someone did,'' he says. As he views it, he and Park Place are giving it -- some of it -- back. ''For me, it's the perfect marriage. It's not the end of an era; it guarantees the continuation of something I consider near and dear,'' says Mr. Kutsher, who will continue to run Kutsher's.</p>
        <p>Negotiations for the sale of the resort his family has owned since 1907 were completed in a single, tearless 16-hour session where he ''felt like'' his father was at his side and knew his mother was: ''At 2 a.m., I looked at the clock and told her to go home, that I'd finish the details, and she said, 'No way.' '' The family has always done business its own way.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Kutsher left to study business at the Wharton School (and surreptitiously studied basketball as Mr. Chamberlain, another ex-Kutsher's bellboy, began his career with the Philadelphia Warriors), his parents turned the rite of passage into an advertising gimmick.</p>
        <p>''Come to Kutsher's Now Before Mark Gets Out of Business School and Paves Over the Lake!'' screamed the billboards, the annual mailings, the word-of-mouth. It worked. The guests swarmed, and kvetched about what smart alecks college kids were.</p>
        <p>''I was the bad boy who was going to come back from school and pave over nature. I took it in stride, because it brought in business,'' Mr. Kutsher recalls, settling into a down-filled sofa in an office suite where a trick goldfish (it plays dead), duck decoys and a lamp-size Venus de Milo dominate the decor.</p>
        <p>They say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree. Using that rationale, Mr. Kutsher, the third generation of Kutsher to operate the resort, is the apple who refused to leave the tree. Except for the Wharton stint, he was never able to tear himself away from the daily goings-on at Kutsher's. He tried law school, but after 18 months he was back home supervising construction of 44 new guest rooms.</p>
        <p>His two children wandered -- one's in Manhattan, the other in Paris -- so he had fewer qualms about selling. ''But I'll still be here. I've got a whole drawer-full of plans.''</p>
