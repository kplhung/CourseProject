        <p>A 5-year-old girl who had cerebral palsy was found dead in her Bronx apartment Wednesday, and a preliminary report by the chief medical examiner's office yesterday indicated that her tiny 17-pound body showed signs of acute malnutrition.</p>
        <p>The police and prosecutors detained the child's mother for more than 24 hours before deciding to release her. Law enforcement officials said last night that a final autopsy would be needed before they determined whether to seek criminal charges against the mother, Ebony Carzan, 24, in the death of her daughter Ahsianea.</p>
        <p>Investigators said that the woman's three other children appeared healthy, but that the apartment was a filthy shambles, that no food was in the refrigerator, and that roaches had bitten Ahsianea, who was no taller than a toddler and had the weight of an 8-month-old baby.</p>
        <p>Until a further investigation is done, the authorities said, it is impossible to say whether the child's death was the result of parental neglect or the sad end of a life stunted by extreme physical problems, inadequate resources and family conflict.</p>
        <p>''This may be a misguided mother who attempted to take care of a child that no one could take care of,'' a senior police official said. ''We don't know if this was neglectful, if it was a mother incapable of doing the right thing, or if it was a mother who was doing the right thing.''</p>
        <p>Late yesterday evening, Alberta Hanley of Harlem, the child's paternal grandmother, whose call brought the police to the child's death bed, provided a copy of a long e-mail letter she said she had sent more than a year ago to Nicholas Scoppetta, the commissioner of the city's Administration for Children's Services. In the letter, she accused the mother of a systematic pattern of abuse and neglect, and said that the agency's caseworkers had repeatedly failed to take action, and she begged for help.</p>
        <p>Starting in 1996, ''I personally witnessed forms of abuse,'' the grandmother wrote in the e-mail message, which was posted to the city's official Web site on Feb. 22, 1999. It goes on to refer to numerous calls made to the state child abuse hot line.</p>
        <p>''The outcome is always the same,'' the e-mail message said. ''Services are offered to the mother. She complies as long as an A.C.S. worker is assigned to her, her case is closed. The abuse begins again.''</p>
        <p>The agency's Web site notes that complaints cannot be accepted by e-mail, but must be called in. Jennifer Falk, a spokeswoman for the agency, said that the surviving children had been placed in foster care and that the way the case had been handled was under investigation.</p>
        <p>Based on court records and interviews with child welfare officials, lawyers and police officials, Ahsianea Carzan's short, difficult life had become a source of angry charges between her estranged parents and had been the subject of at least two court-ordered investigations by the city agency responsible for protecting the well-being of the city's most vulnerable children.</p>
        <p>As recently as last December, a law enforcement official said, the mother took the child to a doctor. Ahsianea then weighed less than 17 pounds, the official said, but given the great difficulty of nourishing a child with her severe disabilities, the doctor found no reason to suspect neglect. Cerebral palsy, usually caused by lack of oxygen and nutrition to parts of the brain before birth, can cause a wide range of problems, including a failure to grow normally.</p>
        <p>Twice, the child was the focus of inquiries by the Administration for Children's Services. In November 1998, child protective workers checking a report of medical neglect arising from the parents' custody dispute in Family Court found that the mother was providing ''adequate care,'' and referred Ms. Carzan to programs providing help with housing, counseling and support for children with cerebral palsy.</p>
        <p>Child welfare officials closed the case in August 1999.</p>
        <p>Then last October, responding to another in a series of accusations by the child's father, Caseim Brown, 29, a caseworker from the Administration for Children's Services visited the apartment to check on the children, Family Court records show. The caseworker found two older siblings -- a girl, 7, and a boy, 6 -- in good health, but apparently left without seeing Ahsianea. The court records said the father had been uncooperative in the investigation.</p>
        <p>Court records indicate that child welfare authorities had reason to be cautious about the father's complaints because he had a long history of domestic violence against Ms. Carzan, and had repeatedly violated orders of protection requiring him to stay away from her. Ms. Carzan, who also has a 16-month-old child, had repeatedly fled from him, living at a domestic violence shelter in Staten Island in 1996, and in apartments in Queens, Manhattan and the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors in the Bronx said Mr. Brown is currently facing criminal charges that he choked and punched Ms. Carzan last September and took her cell phone and jewelry, and he has pleaded not guilty.</p>
        <p>In an interview last night, Mr. Brown, a barber, said that when he picked up his three children for visits, they often appeared dirty and thin, but did not seem dangerously uncared for. Ms. Carzan, he added, did not drink or use drugs. To avoid confrontations with her, he said, he always picked up the children at the 40th Precinct station house in the Bronx. He said he last saw them over Thanksgiving.</p>
        <p>Cerebral palsy was diagnosed in Ahsianea when she was 1 or 2 and she became blind as a result when she was 3 or 4, Mr. Brown said.</p>
        <p>Efforts to locate Ms. Carzan last night for comment after her release were unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>At 5:36 Wednesday morning, when the police entered the sixth-floor apartment in the Patterson Houses, they found the child's body in bed, wearing a diaper, with roach larvae in her hair. A law enforcement official said it appeared that the 7-year-old girl had at times been the caretaker for her little sister, who was so physically disabled by her congenital condition that she swallowed with difficulty.</p>
        <p>A law enforcement official said of the mother, ''She was probably giving up on the child. It took about an hour to feed her.''</p>
        <p>Neighbors watched through peepholes as the police and emergency workers arrived at the dingy public housing project at 2465 Third Avenue where the Carzan family had lived for less than a year. Several said they were astonished to learn of Ahsianea's existence. DeNobia Brooks, 23, remembered glimpsing her once before Christmas, ''a thin little girl in a wheelchair'' that Ms. Carzan was pushing to a bus, but then simply forgot that a disabled child was part of the Carzan family because she did not see Ahsianea again.</p>
        <p>Rafaela Martinez, who lives down the hall from the Carzan family and  is herself raising a foster child with cerebral palsy, said she had regularly seen the two older children playing in the hallway in their school uniforms, but had no idea that Ms. Carzan, who was not known to socialize in the building, had been caring for a child like Ahsianea. ''I wish I had known,'' Ms. Martinez said. ''I would have lent her a hand.''</p>
        <p>More recently, the son of another project resident reported he had seen Ahsianea. ''My son told me she was so skinny, so small, like a little bird,'' said April White, who lives in another building in the project.</p>
        <p>Dr. Irwin Redlener, a pediatrician who directs the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center, said that although cerebral palsy can range from mild to catastrophic, at the severe end of the spectrum the children are very hard to nourish and require a complicated array of medical specialists to keep them from succumbing to infection.</p>
        <p>''Children like this put fantastic stress on families,'' he said. ''It is even more stressful to families with little economic resources. This is a very malnourished child with cerebral palsy. The question is, under any circumstances, could this child have been better nourished?''</p>
        <p>Across the hall from the family apartment, Agnes Berger and her daughter, Michele, were unwilling to pass judgment too quickly. ''A lot of people are at fault here, not just the mother,'' Mrs. Berger said.</p>
