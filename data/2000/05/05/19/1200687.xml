        <p>Turnovers by the Devils and inadequate goaltending by the usually outstanding Martin Brodeur allowed the Flyers to take away New Jersey's home-ice advantage tonight with a 4-2 victory in Game 3 of the Eastern Conference finals.</p>
        <p>The Devils had split the first two games of the four-of-seven-game series in Philadelphia, but the Flyers have now gained the edge with an inspiring performance from the entire team, but especially from Brian Boucher, the rookie goaltender, who made 27 saves.</p>
        <p>Boucher clearly outplayed Brodeur, who made only 17 saves, none of them spectacular. Boucher, in contrast, made several brilliant saves.</p>
        <p>Brodeur admitted that this was ''the worst game I've played in the playoffs by far.''</p>
        <p>Game 4 will be at the Meadowlands on Saturday night.</p>
        <p>The Devils had the territorial advantage for the most part before a sellout crowd at Continental Arena, but they were repeatedly denied by Boucher, who was beaten only by Claude Lemieux and Scott Niedermayer.</p>
        <p>On one save, Boucher was reminiscent of Dominik Hasek. He sprawled to his right as Patrik Elias tried to deke him with a move from right to left. He found himself on his back and covered the puck with the back of his left glove.</p>
        <p>''People are going to say that,'' Boucher said when he was told that save was vintage Hasek, ''but it was just desperation. I tried to get my arm on it and I was lucky.''</p>
        <p>That save came during the first power play in the game for the Flyers, beginning 12 seconds after the first intermission. Elias broke away alone on Boucher only to be denied, and when Elias looked at the screen on the scoreboard when a replay of the action came on he shook his head in disbelief.</p>
        <p>''We missed chances and they made their chances count,'' said Coach Larry Robinson of the Devils. ''They played our game better than we played our game. We played well at times, but we were guilty of turnovers in wrong situations.''</p>
        <p>While the Devils kept failing against Boucher, the Flyers made the best of their chances against Brodeur, who allowed goals to Mark Recchi, Keith Jones, Rick Tocchet and Simon Gagne. Three of the goals were the result of turnovers by the Devils, including the crucial first goal that took the sellout crowd away from the Devils.</p>
        <p>A turnover by Vladimir Malakhov, the Devils' lanky Russian defenseman, led to the first goal before the game was three minutes old, but Malakhov redeemed himself somewhat just under under two minutes later with a precision pass to Lemieux that tied the score.</p>
        <p>Along with committing turnovers, the Devils were also guilty of not going to the net for rebounds. The Flyers, however, went to the net with authority, and it paid off with 5 minutes 46 seconds left in the first period, when Jones scored the second goal for Philadelphia. He barreled into Brodeur in the crease and converted a rebound from a shot by Keith Primeau that hit Brodeur on the chest and dropped in front.</p>
        <p>''They went to the net more than we did,'' Robinson said.</p>
        <p>Jones and Tocchet gave the Flyers a 3-1 lead before Niedermayer narrowed the gap with 4:01 left only to have Gagne seal the victory for the Flyers when he went around defenseman Brian Rafalski.</p>
        <p>Both teams played without centers injured in Game 2. John Madden, a key defensive specialist, missed the game for the Devils because of a knee injury that will keep him out indefinitely.</p>
        <p>Madden's place was taken by Steve Brule, who made his National Hockey League debut.</p>
        <p>Robinson said before the game he selected Brule over Steve Kelly as a replacement for Madden because Brule was good at face-offs, but Brule lost seven of the nine face-offs he took in the first two periods, including four of five in the first.</p>
        <p>The Flyers, already missing their superstar center Eric Lindros, who is out with a concussion, were also  without center Daymond Langkow, who incurred a concussion when he was hit by Scott Stevens soon after scoring what proved to be the winning goal in Game 2.</p>
        <p>Robinson started shuffling his lines midway through the middle period.</p>
        <p>The biggest change was reuniting Lemieux with Scott Gomez and Alexander Mogilny after Lemieux played the first 30 minutes as the right wing on the checking line, with Brule his center and Jay Pandolfo the left wing.</p>
