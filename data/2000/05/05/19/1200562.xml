        <p>Making the most sweeping changes of any broadcast network, Fox announced a new prime-time lineup for the next television season yesterday that introduces seven dramas and two comedies.</p>
        <p>The roster is heavy with new science fiction entries, one of which Fox hopes will emerge as the replacement for ''The X-Files,'' which is now scheduled for what is presumably its last year after its settlement this week with its creator, Chris Carter, and its star, David Duchovny.</p>

        <p>Making the most sweeping changes of any broadcast network, Fox announced a new prime-time lineup for the next television season yesterday that introduces seven dramas and two comedies.</p>
        <p>The roster is heavy with new science fiction entries, one of which Fox hopes will emerge as the replacement for ''The X-Files,'' which is now scheduled for what is presumably its last year after its settlement this week with its creator, Chris Carter, and its star, David Duchovny.</p>
        <p>Mr. Duchovny, whose Mulder character will be abducted by aliens in Sunday's season finale, agreed after long negotiations to return for half of the episodes next season. As part of the deal, Fox settled Mr. Duchovny's lawsuit against the company. He had charged that he was deprived of potential profits on the sales of the show's repeats.</p>
        <p>Mr. Duchovny's partner, played by Gillian Anderson, will spend the first part of next season hunting for Mulder, and then in the last 11 episodes they will be reunited, after which they will wind down to a finale for the characters -- if not the series -- next May.</p>
        <p>Fox hopes that by then one of its new dramas will be ready to fill the 9 p.m. Sunday spot. Mr. Carter has one entry in the sweepstakes, ''The Lone Gunmen,'' a spinoff of ''The X-Files'' featuring a strange threesome of computer hackers: Langley, Byers and Frohike. That series is one of two that Fox is announcing as part of its fall schedule, even though they won't begin until January.</p>
        <p>The other is simply being called ''The Michael Crichton Project,'' and the writer of ''Jurassic Park'' is still working on the script, with no details available yet.</p>
        <p>Beyond Mr. Crichton and Mr. Carter, Fox has lined up other well-known producers for its new shows, including David E. Kelley, James Cameron, Gregg Hale (the creator of the ''Blair Witch Project''), Darren Star and Marcy Carsey and Tom Werner.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kelley's show ''Boston Public'' is about the faculty at a public high school in suburban Boston, the area where both of his other shows, ''Ally McBeal'' and ''The Practice,'' are set. Mr. Kelley is so highly regarded that he secured the spot on Monday leading into ''Ally McBeal,'' even though he has not shot a pilot for the new show, which is not even cast yet.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cameron, in his first effort since the phenomenally successful ''Titanic,'' has created a series called ''Dark Angel,'' a futuristic thriller about a genetically enhanced  teenager trying to escape her military handlers in the Pacific Northwest in the early 21st century. It stars Jessica Alba.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hale's ''Fearsum'' will be an overt attempt to scare the wits out of viewers the way ''Blair Witch'' did. In this one, the operator of an underground Web site discovers e-mail from his dead brother and seeks to track him.</p>
        <p>Another of the sci-fi contenders has only a tangential connection to a great producer. ''Night Visions'' clearly owes a lot to the late Rod Serling in its effort to create a horror anthology that recalls ''The Twilight Zone.'' The show promises scary tales with bizarre twists.</p>
        <p>Mr. Star will not be competing with the terror entries, but his new series, ''The Street,'' is intended to bring to mind his other hit, HBO's ''Sex and the City.'' This is the male version, with a batch of young turks from Wall Street on the prowl for money and women.</p>
        <p>The Carsey-Werner production company is behind Fox's highest-profile new comedy, ''Don't Ask,'' in which John Goodman returns to weekly television as Rex, a single father with teenagers who takes in the family of his irresponsible friend David. What David doesn't know is that Rex is gay.</p>
        <p>The other new comedy is ''Schimmel,'' a vehicle for the stand-up comedian David Schimmel, who plays a family man who cannot help being startlingly abrasive.</p>
        <p>The Fox schedule:</p>
        <p>MONDAY: ''Boston Public,'' ''Ally McBeal.''</p>
        <p>TUESDAY: ''That 70's Show,'' ''Titus,''  ''Dark Angel.''</p>
        <p>WEDNESDAY: ''Don't Ask,'' ''Schimmel,'' ''The Street.''</p>
        <p>THURSDAY: Movies (until January), ''The Lone Gunmen''; ''The Michael Crichton Project.''</p>
        <p>FRIDAY: ''Fearsum,'' ''Night Visions.''</p>
        <p>SATURDAY: ''Cops,'' ''Cops'' (repeats), ''America's Most Wanted.''</p>
        <p>SUNDAY: ''Futurama,'' ''King of the Hill,'' ''The Simpsons,'' ''Malcolm in the Middle,'' ''The X-Files.''</p>
