        <p>Re ''Poll Shows Bush Ahead of Gore, With Leadership a Crucial Issue'' (front page, May 16):</p>
        <p>I was surprised to see the results of your presidential poll stating that even though the majority was more in agreement with the positions of Al Gore, they thought that George W. Bush would be the better leader.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has extensive experience in the Senate and as an active vice president, and is well informed on national and foreign affairs. Mr. Bush has had limited experience as the governor of a single state.</p>
        <p>Both men have made mistakes, but it seems that when Mr. Bush makes a mistake showing a lack of knowledge or understanding, people don't take it seriously -- they sort of expect it -- yet when Mr. Gore makes a mistake (as with his interference in the case of Elian Gonzalez), he is castigated.</p>
        <p>Actually that's a compliment, as it shows we expect more of him, but it doesn't work to his advantage in this political era.</p>
