        <p>As the men's Division I tournament heads into the quarterfinals this weekend, first-seeded Syracuse and second-seeded Virginia remain solid favorites. Unseeded Notre Dame, which might not have broken into this lacrosse summit except for an automatic bid, remains the solid surprise.</p>
        <p>In the opening round last weekend, Maryland beat Hofstra by  14-12, Duke routed Hobart by 13-1 and Georgetown upended Cornell by 14-12. The other game provided a big upset as Notre Dame eliminated fifth-seeded Loyola of Maryland by 15-13.</p>

        <p>As the men's Division I tournament heads into the quarterfinals this weekend, first-seeded Syracuse and second-seeded Virginia remain solid favorites. Unseeded Notre Dame, which might not have broken into this lacrosse summit except for an automatic bid, remains the solid surprise.</p>
        <p>In the opening round last weekend, Maryland beat Hofstra by  14-12, Duke routed Hobart by 13-1 and Georgetown upended Cornell by 14-12. The other game provided a big upset as Notre Dame eliminated fifth-seeded Loyola of Maryland by 15-13.</p>
        <p>Notre Dame (10-3), the only non-East Coast team in the 12-college tournament, got in the door as the Midwest regional representative. Its victory was only the second in the tournament by a Midwestern team since 1987. Both have been by the Irish.</p>
        <p>''Am I surprised we won?'' Notre Dame Coach Kevin Corrigan said. ''No, I'm not. We lost in mid-March to Loyola, 12-2, but I think we've improved a tremendous amount since. We played very poorly then, and I felt at the time it was an aberration. We're a much better team now.''</p>
        <p>The quarterfinals start tomorrow in New Brunswick, N.J., with Syracuse (12-1) against unseeded Georgetown (12-2), and third-seeded Princeton (10-2) against sixth-seeded Maryland (11-4). On Sunday in Baltimore, it will be Virginia (12-1) against seventh-seeded Duke (10-4) and fourth-seeded Johns Hopkins (8-3) against Notre Dame.</p>
        <p>Corrigan said he did not fear a letdown.</p>
        <p>''I don't worry about our guys not being excited,'' he said. ''I worry about Johns Hopkins having so many outstanding players. I know they're good because I recruited most of them.''</p>
        <p>WOMEN'S DIVISION I TOURNAMENT</p>
        <p>For five consecutive years, Maryland has won the Division I women's title. The Terrapins almost lost their bid to make it six straight.</p>
        <p>In last Sunday's quarterfinals, Georgetown held the ball, moved it around and seldom shot until it got just the shots it wanted. It could do that because while men's lacrosse has the equivalent of a delay-of-game rule, the women have no shot clock and no ban against freezing the ball.</p>
        <p>First-seeded Maryland escaped with a 7-6 overtime victory. As Cindy Timchal, the Maryland coach, explained:</p>
        <p>''It was like Dean Smith's four-corner offense years ago in basketball. Georgetown was shortening the game, and they caught us a little off guard, but it was a good experience for us because we know now that something like this could happen. Credit them, but credit our team for hanging in.''</p>
        <p>In the other quarterfinals, second-seeded Princeton got by Duke, 9-8, in sudden-death overtime; third-seeded James Madison beat Virginia, 12-5; and unseeded Loyola of Maryland defeated North Carolina, 7-5.</p>
        <p>Today's semifinals in Ewing, N.J., near Trenton, send Maryland (19-1) against Loyola (16-4), and Princeton (14-4) against James Madison (13-5). Maryland's approach, according to Timchal, will be, ''Just expect nothing and be ready for anything.''</p>
        <p>MEN'S DIVISION II TOURNAMENT</p>
        <p>In a sport in which every other National Collegiate Athletic Association men's and women's division plays or shares a postseason tournament, men's Division II is a stepchild. It has no tournament, just a championship game between handpicked teams from the North and South. This year, the teams are C.W. Post of Brookville, N.Y., (8-3) and Limestone College of Gaffney, S.C. (13-2).</p>
        <p>Their game is part of the men's championship weekend in College Park, Md. In Byrd Stadium, Maryland's football home, the Division I men's lacrosse semifinals will be played Saturday, May 27; the Division III final Sunday and the Division I final Monday. On Sunday, the Division II championship game will be relegated to an adjoining soccer field.</p>
        <p>Are the Division II players second-class citizens? ''I think we feel that,'' said Tom Postel, in his 15th season as the C.W. Post coach.</p>
        <p>Actually, the situation had been worse. The N.C.A.A. has 55 lacrosse-playing colleges in Division I, only 32 in Division II and 117 in Division III. Division II lost its postseason action before it was reinstated in 1993. Now it has a two-team tournament, and next year there will be four teams.</p>
        <p>Since 1993, this title has been won only by C.W. Post, New York Tech and Adelphi. Postel said he thought his team could extend the Long Island streak.</p>
        <p>''We beat Limestone pretty handily last year,'' he said, ''but I don't think that has anything to do with this year. They're much stronger, and we were so busy trying to make the championship that we didn't scout them.''</p>
