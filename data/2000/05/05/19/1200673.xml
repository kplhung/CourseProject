        <p>William F. Buckley Jr., a founder of modern American conservatism who 49 years ago accused Yale of rejecting God, is returning to campus on Monday, this time to accept an honorary degree from the university he has so devoutly castigated.</p>
        <p>After the university's class of 2000 graduates, Yale officials will award Mr. Buckley (class of 1950) a degree that recognizes his influence on political thought and his career as an iconoclast, which began a half-century ago with a withering attack on his alma mater.</p>
        <p>In ''God and Man at Yale: The Superstitions of 'Academic Freedom,' '' published in 1951, Mr. Buckley assailed Yale for drifting from its Christian foundations and teaching unalloyed liberalism in its classrooms. The uproar that followed made the book a best seller and catapulted Mr. Buckley, then just 25, to national prominence.</p>
        <p>The book so scandalized university officials that they appointed a committee, led by the president of the Union Theological Seminary in Manhattan, to look into Mr. Buckley's allegations, said Gaddis Smith, a Yale professor of history. In November 1951, McGeorge Bundy, himself a Yale graduate, published a scathing indictment of Mr. Buckley in The Atlantic Monthly.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Buckley, 74, has ventured back to Yale since then, the honorary degree is the first signal that he and the school he eviscerated so famously have patched up their differences.</p>
        <p>''Because of Bill Buckley, Yale became a symbol of the liberal establishment that the conservative movement wanted to destroy,'' said Sam Tanenhaus, a contributing editor at Vanity Fair who is writing a biography of Mr. Buckley. ''These enemies are now embracing each other.''</p>
        <p>The honor is supposed to be a big secret.  Lawrence J. Haas, the university's spokesman, would neither confirm nor deny that Yale planned to give Mr. Buckley a degree, citing the school's tradition of keeping the names of honorarians under seal until graduation day.</p>
        <p>But friends of Mr. Buckley -- and even Mr. Buckley himself, tacitly -- acknowledged today that he would be given, and would accept, the degree. ''What he told me was: 'It's true. God has finally returned to Yale,' '' Mr. Tanenhaus said.</p>
        <p>Robert Massie, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author and historian who, despite divergent political views, has remained close to Mr. Buckley since their Yale days, helped bring the university and its most famous critic together.</p>
        <p>''The fact that Yale is giving Bill a degree is very significant, but I think we should do it their way,'' Mr. Massie said.</p>
        <p>Contacted via e-mail, Mr. Buckley initially responded by writing, ''Sorry -- tacent satis laudant,'' a Latin phrase meaning ''silence is praise enough.''</p>
        <p>Later he wrote a second note: ''I HATE being coy, but what am I supposed to do? There are heavy deposits over the years of Yale-incited/encouraged/tolerated criticisms of me and my work, so maybe we can leave it at that, that if it's true, Yale is  transcending itself.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Buckley's torment of Yale began as an undergraduate, when he helped found a student group that published Lux et Veritas, a conservative campus magazine.</p>
        <p>Years later, as the cold war and Communism consumed American political debate, Mr. Buckley published a book defending Senator Joseph McCarthy, who had categorically denounced scores of prominent citizens as Communists.</p>
        <p>Mr. Buckley went on to start National Review, a conservative magazine, in 1955, and the television program ''Firing Line'' in 1966.</p>
        <p>But it was ''God and Man at Yale'' that remains his signature achievement, one that catapulted American conservatism from an obscure movement populated by isolationists, protectionists and bigots into mainstream politics.</p>
        <p>''Buckley was the most prominent and visible member of our class, as I suppose he has been ever since,'' Mr. Massie said. ''Everybody was aware of what Bill was doing and what he thought, and many of us admired him even though we didn't agree with his views.''</p>
        <p>Professor Smith, who referred to Mr. Buckley as ''an old friend'' and to the book as ''a juvenile attack on Yale,'' said it was intended as a warning to other prominent alumni.</p>
        <p>''I think it's impact on Yale was positive,'' Mr. Gaddis said. ''It made Yale re-examine itself and pay more attention to the alumni than it had in the past.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Buckley has returned to Yale before. As early as November 1972, he gave a speech to more than 400 people gathered at the Yale Political Union. In October 1990, Mr. Buckley joined the Yale Chamber Symphony Players for a recital at Battell Chapel on campus, where he performed a harpsichord solo. In 1996 and 1997, he taught two popular seminars on English composition. Last winter, he spoke at an alumni dinner held by the campus newspaper.</p>
        <p>But he is no longer a polarizing figure on campus. Asked about Mr. Buckley, only about half of the dozen Yale undergraduates interviewed today said they knew much about him. And none of the four bookstores surrounding campus carry ''God and Man at Yale.''</p>
        <p>''The only reason a student would buy that book is to give it as a gift to a grandparent,'' said Lynn Winningham, a sophomore history major who works at Atticus Bookstore and Cafe across the street from the university.</p>
        <p>Josh Kagan, 21, said he had read ''God and Man at Yale,'' but disagreed with the book and with Mr. Buckley. ''I think he's an articulate fool,'' Mr. Kagan said. ''He's the emblem of Old Yale -- he comes from privilege and doesn't seem to know he comes from privilege.''</p>
        <p>Simon Brandler, 20, also a history major, said he was ''empowered by the fact he cringes and recoils at what Yale has become.</p>
        <p>''He's a symbol of how much Yale has changed in the last 40, 50 years.''</p>
        <p>Yet the Buckley influence persists at Yale. Professor Smith recently taught a class called ''Yale and the External World'' that used Mr. Buckley's famous book as a reference, and Mr. Smith is now writing a book on the same topic. And every now and again, an editorial appears in The Yale Daily News from a student lambasting or praising Mr. Buckley's intellectual groundwork.</p>
        <p>''This lack of faith in ourselves, and generalized disrespect for religion, might be what Buckley feared 45 years ago,'' wrote one student, Aaron Honn, in a February 1996 editorial. ''It is up to us to make sure that there is always a place for God at Yale.''</p>
        <p>The place Yale is officially making for Mr. Buckley is well deserved, Mr. Tanenhaus said. ''Bill has become a kind of humanist, which perhaps he wasn't before,'' he said. ''Politics has changed, Yale has changed and Bill has changed. They have all converged at this moment.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 30, 2000, Tuesday  An article on May 19 about William F. Buckley Jr.'s return to Yale to accept an honorary degree referred incorrectly at one point to a history professor there who taught a class using Mr. Buckley's book and is writing one on the same topic. He is Gaddis Smith, not Mr. Gaddis.</p>
