        <p>Battlefield Earth  John Travolta, Barry Pepper, Forest Whitaker, Sabine Karsenti  Directed by Roger Christian  PG-13 117 minutes</p>
        <p>Remember Y2K? Now another millennium has flown by, and what's left of mankind scampers around icy mountain crags, wearing scraps of fur and hide and eating rats raw. In the year 3000 humans are enslaved by 9-foot-tall aliens called Psychlos, after their planet, who came and conquered all the Earth's peoples. It took them nine minutes.</p>
        <p>Humans are so traumatized they communicate in grunts while slowly relearning all the old cliches. ''A good woman is hard to find,'' someone says. Actually any woman is hard to find, save the lithe and smoldering Chrissie (Ms. Karsenti), who is around to be paired with the bounding hero of the piece, Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Mr. Pepper).</p>
        <p>Jonnie would defy the oppressors. They want the earth's gold, these Psychlos, who are none too natty themselves in outfits that put one in mind of Bert Lahr's Cowardly Lion in ''The Wizard of Oz.'' Their chief of security, Terl, runs the show. Despite the simian hairdo and ludicrous nose apparatus, Terl occasionally reminds one of Mr. Travolta. Anyway, the movie frequently is so murky that it is hard to tell who is who or what is what.</p>
        <p>The gist seems to be that if Jonnie can race over here to do this and then rush over there to do that, the Psychlos will be sent packing. At that Terl just throws back his maned head and emits phony roars of laughter (not Mr. Travolta's strongest vocal suit).</p>
        <p>Then the humans hop into some thousand-year-old jet fighters as if they were in ''Independence Day.'' A huge glass dome cracks and shatters, which is unhealthy for the Psychlos. Terl ends up in a cage.</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE Psychlos bat Earthlings around and subsequent warfare results in moderately graphic injuries and death.</p>
        <p>SEX Some musings, but no sex to speak of.</p>
        <p>PROFANITY A small amount.</p>
        <p>FOOTNOTE This is an amazingly bad movie adapted from a novel by L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of the Church of Scientology. Since Mr. Travolta is dedicated to that belief, it has been conjectured that the film is intended to push moviegoers in that direction, perhaps with subliminal messages. Considering its overall ineptitude, this is hard to imagine. Is it a trick?</p>
        <p>For Which Children?</p>
        <p>UNDER AGE 9 Much too loud and violent for the little ones.</p>
        <p>AGES 10-12 Absurd twaddle that few would take seriously, and no great harm will be done.</p>
        <p>AGES 13 AND UP It's their money.</p>
        <p>Gladiator  Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie Nielsen, Oliver Reed, Richard Harris  Directed by Ridley Scott  R 150 minutes</p>
        <p>The Romans always could lay on a battle, and we begin with legions led by the general Maximus (Mr. Crowe) performing their catapult-and-pike routine on a mob of howling tribesmen in the forests of Germania. Arriving late as usual by plushly appointed carriage, the emperor's son, Commodus (Mr. Phoenix), and his scheming sister, Lucilla (Ms. Nielsen), pay their respects to their father, Marcus Aurelius (Mr. Harris), and give a wary nod to the general.</p>
        <p>Clearly there is unease in the command tent. With his son an unbalanced weakling, the elderly Emperor plans to pass power to Maximus, who would really prefer to go home and tend his fields and be with his wife and young son. But the frail and dying Aurelius needs him to effect a shift of authority from the throne to the Senate. Rome is to become a republic again.</p>
        <p>Commodus is not comfortable with that idea. In short order his father has gone to his end even more quickly than his condition indicated. Maximus is taken off to be executed but escapes. Not so lucky, his wife and son are crucified and burned alive by Praetorians dispatched by Commodus. When next we encounter the grief-stricken general, he has been sold to a gladiator merchant (Mr. Reed) and sent to a training camp in North Africa.</p>
        <p>Invincible on the battlefield, Maximus butchers all comers in the ring and is soon ready for the big time in Rome. After decimating half an army in the Colosseum, he becomes a hero of the people. But how does he stand with Commodus?</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE Those who are about to die salute you, and that's just about everybody. Decapitations, mutilations -- even a tiger gets his in the ring, stabbed in the belly.</p>
        <p>SEX None.</p>
        <p>PROFANITY None, though gladiators could be excused a four-letter outburst or two.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?</p>
        <p>UNDER AGE 12 Forget about it.</p>
        <p>AGES 12-13 An individual parental decision. Until the end, when the melodrama and digital enhancement go over the top, the film is an entertaining experience. But then there is the violence.</p>
        <p>AGES 14 AND UP Undoubtedly most of them (boys anyway) have already seen the film. On balance, a thumb's up.</p>
        <p>Center Stage  Amanda Schull, Zoe Saldana, Susan May Pratt, Peter Gallagher, Ethan Stiefel, Donna Murphy, Sascha Radetsky, Eion Bailey, Ilia Kulik  Directed by Nicholas Hytner  PG-13 113 minutes</p>
        <p>Culled from stiff auditions, the teenage dancers come to New York to train at the American Ballet Academy and vie for a chance to join the American Ballet Company. This crop includes Jody (Ms. Schull) with a lovely face but a weak turn-out, bad feet and the wrong kind of body; Maureen (Ms. Pratt), supremely talented but bulimic and miserable; and Eva (Ms. Saldana), also gifted, but with a possibly ruinous attitude problem. Sergei (Mr. Kulik) is from Russia and in clubs tells girls he is Mafia, not a ballet dancer.</p>
        <p>Jonathan (Mr. Gallagher), the duly arrogant academy director, drives them hard. Three boys and three girls will be chosen for the company, with the decision to be announced after a workshop performance before a packed house at Lincoln Center. Pressure? It's enough to make Maureen buckle and run off to her calm, funny Columbia pre-med boyfriend (Mr. Bailey). After a lot of abuse, Jody thinks she might be a better Broadway dancer.</p>
        <p>On a personal note she weighs the attentions of Cooper (Mr. Stiefel), an established company star, and a classmate (Mr. Radetsky). Eventually the three resolve the matter before an audience of thousands in a number choreographed for the workshop by the flamboyant Cooper.</p>
        <p>In a film that doesn't devote much effort to inventing original characters and situations, careers and relationships take shape -- or don't -- strictly according to expectations.</p>
        <p>VIOLENCE None.</p>
        <p>SEX The dancing gets risque and Jody and Cooper go to bed, though the act goes unrecorded.</p>
        <p>PROFANITY Some.</p>
        <p>For Which Children?</p>
        <p>AGES 3-7 Too young.</p>
        <p>AGES 8-10 Parents should make a cautious judgment, but most children will enjoy the film.</p>
        <p>AGES 11 AND UP The film's formulaic approach may annoy some viewers. Otherwise they should have fun.</p>
