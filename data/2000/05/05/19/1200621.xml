        <p>JDS Uniphase, the largest component manufacturer for fiber optic equipment, said today that Kevin Kalkhoven had retired as co-chairman and chief executive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kalkhoven, 55, is succeeded by Jozef Straus, 53, who has been co-chairman, president and chief operating officer since the company was formed 18 months ago through the merger of JDS Fitel, of Nepean, Ontario, and Uniphase, of San Jose, Calif. Mr. Kalkhoven said that he was leaving because of exhaustion after several years of 100-hour weeks and that he would start a venture capital fund.</p>
        <p>''This has been nine years of extreme high-intensity activity,'' Mr. Kalkhoven said in a conference call with securities analysts. ''It's been a wonderful time; it's been the pinnacle of my career. But it's also been a very stressful environment.''</p>
        <p>''What we have today,'' he added, ''is only a transition. It's a relatively seamless transition in a company that is going to be a major player for many years to come.''</p>
        <p>Analysts said that confidence in the company remained high despite Mr. Kalkhoven's departure because of the steps he and Mr. Straus had taken to deepen the management team. JDS has been an aggressive acquirer of smaller components companies, and in addition to broadening its product line through these deals it has typically retained senior management.</p>
        <p>''When JDS and Uniphase got together they really did create an industry,'' said Chris Crespi, a Banc America Securities analyst. ''People realized you had to put together a lot of product lines'' to compete across the breadth of the fiber optic market, he said. At JDS Uniphase, he added, ''even without the acquisitions, the internal growth sequentially is very good.''</p>
        <p>Excluding acquisition-related charges, JDS Uniphase recently reported earnings for its fiscal third quarter, ended March 31, of $85.8 million, or 11 cents a diluted share, up 158 percent from $33.2 million, or 5 cents a share, in the period a year earlier. Revenue rose 155 percent, to $394.6 million from $154.9 million.</p>
        <p>JDS Uniphase shares fell $5.75, to $86.75, in heavy Nasdaq trading today. The shares have surged 345-fold since Uniphase went public in 1993 and have more than quadrupled since the merger with JDS.</p>
        <p>''Two years ago we were a $200 million company,'' Mr. Straus said in a telephone interview. ''Now we are a $1 billion company, and we want to be a $4 billion company very soon. So we have a considerable task in front of us, but I think our agility and flexibility will continue to be the driving force.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Straus, a refugee from Soviet-era Czechoslovakia, co-founded JDS Fitel in 1981 and served as its president and chief executive from 1993 until its merger with Uniphase. Bringing the two companies together joined JDS Fitel's leadership in passive optical components, like attenuators and distribution devices, with Uniphase's expertise in active components, like semiconductor lasers.</p>
        <p>With customers like Nortel Networks and Lucent Technologies, JDS Uniphase has been well positioned to ride the commercial explosion of fiber optics. ''We have a natural transition from electrical to optical in the core parts of the network,'' Mr. Crespi of BancAmerica said. ''The volumes are humongous.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Straus has been in charge of production since the merger, while Mr. Kalkhoven focused on strategic acquisitions. Mr. Straus will be succeeded as president and chief operating officer by Charles J. Abbe. Mr. Abbe joined JDS Uniphase as part of the February acquisition of Optical Coating Laboratory of Santa Rosa, Calif.</p>
