        <p>USA Networks Inc. has acquired two digital cable television channels for approximately $100 million, company executives said last night.</p>
        <p>Barry Diller, the USA Networks  chairman, said his company had purchased North American Television Inc., a Canadian concern that owns the Trio network, and News World International.</p>
        <p>Those networks are only available through digital television services offered by providers like DirecTV and Time Warner Cable.</p>
        <p>Trio, an arts and entertainment network, can be viewed in seven million homes. News World International, which shows newscasts from around the world, is available in six million.</p>
        <p>With the continued growth of digital TV, Mr. Diller said he expected the networks' distribution to grow significantly during the next couple of years and predicted that they would eventually become a significant part of his cable TV empire.</p>
        <p>Mr. Diller said he would spend ''hundreds of millions of dollars'' over the course of the next few years to produce new programming for the two networks, which do not currently have very high production values.</p>
        <p>For instance, Mr. Diller said, he would like News World International to run first-rate documentaries and to feature in-depth discussions of issues. Trio, he said, will delve even deeper into the popular arts, including jazz and the theater.</p>
        <p>''We've got big, big aspirations and we're willing to invest what I think anybody would call serious money to get there,'' he said.</p>
        <p>USA Networks does not own other TV networks that strictly feature nonfiction programming. Its USA network runs entertainment shows like ''La Femme Nikita'' and ''Walker, Texas Ranger.'' Its Sci-Fi Channel is geared to science-fiction enthusiasts with shows like ''Sliders'' and ''Farscape.'' USA Networks also owns two shopping networks.</p>
        <p>Since America Online announced that it was buying Time Warner Inc., industry observers have said that they expected Mr. Diller to announce a major deal of his own.</p>
        <p>This latest acquisition marks but another small, calculated step on his part to expand his businesses. However, he recently said that he was interested in buying more traditional media properties.</p>
