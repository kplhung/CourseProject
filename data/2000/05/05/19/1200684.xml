        <p>In a victory for the Clinton administration, the Senate today narrowly rejected a measure to set a deadline for withdrawing American ground troops from Kosovo. Gov. George W. Bush of Texas had also criticized the measure, but even so 40 Republicans voted for it.</p>
        <p>By a vote of 53 to 47, senators stripped a provision from a military construction spending bill that would have cut off funds for the 5,600 United States troops in Kosovo by July 1, 2001, forcing their withdrawal unless Congress authorized an extension.</p>
        <p>In recent days, several of President Clinton's cabinet officers waged an all-out campaign to defeat the measure, phoning wavering senators and sending military commanders to Congress to warn of the dangers to American troops and Washington's commitment to the NATO operation if the measure passed. Defense Secretary William S. Cohen said he would recommend that Mr. Clinton veto the legislation if it passed.</p>
        <p>The outcome was close enough, and important enough for the administration, that Vice President Al Gore presided over the roll-call, prepared to cast a tie-breaking vote if needed. ''To have been forced to withdraw in this manner would have demoralized our allies and emboldened those in the region who favor violence as a solution to their disputes,'' Mr. Gore said in a statement.</p>
        <p>Fifteen of the 55 Republicans voted for a Democratic amendment to strike the withdrawal language from the $8.6 billion military construction spending bill. At least two or three Republicans said they were swayed by Mr. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, but many others were not, and they could challenge him on foreign policy if he becomes President. [News analysis, Page A10.]</p>
        <p>''I'm glad Bush said what he said because it showed this was not aimed at this president in particular,'' said Thad Cochran of Mississippi, who was among those persuaded by Mr. Bush.</p>
        <p>Earlier this week, Mr. Bush criticized the provision, calling it a ''legislative overreach'' that would tie his hands if he became president. Today, a spokesman for Mr. Bush, Scott McClellan, said, ''The Senate made the right decision.''</p>
        <p>The legislation revealed the restiveness in Congress over America's open-ended commitment in Kosovo and Bosnia, which so far has cost $20 billion. It also stoked the smoldering debate over competing prerogatives: Congress's constitutional power of the purse and the president's authority to send American forces to far-flung hot spots.</p>
        <p>In several hours of heated debate today and on Wednesday, both sides accused the other of jeopardizing the safety of United States troops, America's commitment to its European allies and the long-term security of the Balkans.</p>
        <p>''The intent of the amendment is to restore congressional oversight over the Kosovo mission,'' said Senator Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia, the provision's chief Democratic sponsor. ''Of course, the administration doesn't like it. They want a free hand to participate in military adventurism whenever and wherever they please. They don't want to hear a peep out of Congress.''</p>
        <p>But critics said imposing an arbitrary deadline for withdrawal would send a dangerous signal of uncertain American resolve to President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia, and undermine the unity and morale of NATO's peacekeeping operation, which involves forces from Britain, France, Germany, Italy and other nations, in and out of Europe. They are trying to calm Kosovo in the aftermath of NATO's bombing of Yugoslavia early last year, when NATO acted to protect Albanians in the province.</p>
        <p>A deadline ''would precipitate a year of dangerous uncertainty and wavering commitment to our allies,'' said Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, a leading foe of the provision and sponsor of the amendment to kill it.</p>
        <p>The 15 Republicans joined 38 Democrats in supporting Mr. Levin's decisive amendment, while 40 Republicans and 7 Democrats opposed it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levin's measure also eliminated a second provision to withhold 25 percent of the military's funds in Kosovo this year, unless Mr. Clinton certified by July 15 that the European allies were meeting their commitments for reconstruction aid, police officers and food and medicines. Without that certification, the measure required that money could be spent in Kosovo only for an orderly withdrawal of American forces.</p>
        <p>The defeated provision's chief Republican author, Senator John W. Warner of Virginia, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, remained undaunted. He vowed to offer the provision on the European share of aid as an amendment to the Pentagon's budget bill for fiscal year 2001 when that reaches the Senate floor.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, the House approved, by a vote of 264 to 153, an amendment on the European aid share similar to the Senate's. But the House version gives the next president until April 1, 2001, nearly nine months longer than the Senate, to certify that the European allies are meeting their commitments.</p>
        <p>The House version sets even higher standards than the Senate provision. Under the House measure, the allies would be responsible for 50 percent of reconstruction aid; the Senate version required at least 33 percent. The House version would require allies to pick up 90 percent of the new civilian police in Kosovo; the Senate version required 75 percent.</p>
        <p>The allies are now providing 63 percent of the police and are close to providing 75 percent of basic human aid, the White House said. The United States has pledged 15 percent of the total financial support to Kosovo.</p>
        <p>The director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, Jacob J. Lew, said the allies had made significant progress in raising the proportion of their pledges, but he could not guarantee they would meet the targets by July 15.</p>
        <p>Moreover, he said, the allies used different bookkeeping practices, which ''could prevent certification of numeric burden-sharing shares.''</p>
        <p>''The rigid, mechanical burden-sharing tests contained in the amendment undermine the peacekeeping effort,'' Mr. Lew said in a letter to the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota. ''The commitment of American forces abroad should not rest on mechanical formulas and record-keeping technicalities.''</p>
        <p>It was unclear tonight whether Mr. Clinton's advisers would recommend that he veto any legislation containing just the burden-sharing requirements, and not the more onerous language about withdrawing troops.</p>
        <p>But it seemed almost certain that the fight over American military involvement in the Balkans would not end with today's vote.</p>
        <p>''We have no long-term plan for Kosovo,'' complained Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi, the majority leader, who supported the deadline for withdrawing American forces.  ''We don't know how long we're going or how much it's going to cost.  Commitments are not being fulfilled by the Europeans, and that's unacceptable.''</p>
