        <p>The Queens Kings, a Class A affiliate of the Toronto Blue Jays that will change its name when it becomes a Mets farm team in Brooklyn next year, will begin play on June 21, with tickets going on sale June 3.</p>
        <p>The team will play at the Ballpark at St. John's University this season and is scheduled to play in a new $30 million ballpark in Coney Island next year.</p>
        <p>''This is the first resurgence of something into that area of a positive nature,'' said the Brooklyn native Fred Wilpon, the Mets' co-owner.</p>
        <p>''It probably is the best minor league location for a stadium in the country,'' said Wilpon, a Brooklyn native They'll be sold out every day, because ticket prices are going to be $6 and $10.''</p>
        <p>Diamondbacks Arrive</p>
        <p>Last night's game between the Mets and the Colorado Rockies was postponed because of rain and will be made up as part of a doubleheader on Aug. 15 beginning at 5:10 p.m.</p>
        <p>The right-hander Bobby Jones, who was scheduled to make his first start after missing a month with a strained right calf, will start tonight against Arizona.</p>
        <p>''Before the year's over, we're definitely going to need him,'' Valentine said. ''We want him to understand that we need him now.''</p>
        <p>The Mets will be facing the National League West-leading Diamondbacks for the first time since defeating them in the division series last October.</p>
        <p>With the Mets' starters pushed back because of last night's rainout, Mike Hampton will face the Diamondbacks' Randy Johnson on Sunday. Johnson, who is 7-1 this season with an 0.97 earned run average, beat out Hampton for the 1999 National League Cy Young Award. Hampton, who went 22-4 for Houston, finished second in the balloting with 110 points to Johnson's 134.</p>
        <p>No. 24 Out for Henderson</p>
        <p>Rickey Henderson checked in at Shea Stadium again yesterday for the fourth time since the Mets released him five days ago, and he may have a controversy awaiting him when he arrives in Seattle.</p>
        <p>While the Mets gave Henderson No. 24, though it had been semiretired in honor of Willie Mays, the Mariners, who signed Henderson Wednesday, will not do the same. Ken Griffey Jr. wore the number for 11 seasons with the Mariners, and, while they have not retired it, Seattle General Manager Pat Gillick told reporters that Henderson cannot have it.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what number he's going to wear,'' Gillick said, ''but it won't be 24.''</p>
