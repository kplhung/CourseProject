        <p>'Self and Other'  Apex Art Curatorial Program  291 Church Street  TriBeCa  Through tomorrow</p>
        <p>Organized by the Cornell University art historian Salah Hassan, this sharp little exhibition brings together four internationally minded artists of African birth or heritage, each of whom offers a first-person take on what being African means.</p>
        <p>Zineb Sedira, London-based and of Algerian descent, photographs herself looking wraithlike in a white Muslim robe and veil against a white ground. She also brings an aggressive edge to the idea of self-obliteration in a short video, ''Don't Do to Her What You Did to Me,'' in which a woman's passport photo is stirred in a beaker of water until it dissolves.</p>
        <p>Berni Searle of South Africa, whose background is African and European, photographs parts of her body smeared with brightly colored spices, as if to claim a heritage and suggest ideas of exoticism and consumption that the term ''colored'' implies. Hassan Musa, from Sudan and now living in France, uses a bit of art-historical surgery to graft the head of the Mona Lisa onto the female torso of Courbet's ''Origin of the World,'' producing an effect of monstrousness often attributed in the West to African art.</p>
        <p>Division and wholeness are the themes of a piece by Olu Oguibe -- artist, poet and editor of Nka: Journal of Contemporary African Art -- who was born in Nigeria and now lives in the United States. His austere, shrinelike installation consists of enlarged prints of his own childhood portrait, but shown in duplicate as if depicting identical twins, one of whom in this case is a surrogate for the artist's dead brother. Such commemorative practice has roots in Yoruba tradition, as a way of keeping the past intact. In this instance it also hints at the kind of divided but mirrored self-image that living between cultures, as all these artists do, can create.</p>
