        <p>In many neighborhoods, it would be an easy question to decide: Should a long-vacant property, centrally located in one of the city's most overcrowded school districts, be used for a new 900-seat elementary school or for a Staples office supply store?</p>
        <p>In Maspeth, Queens, just such a question has led to a wrenching debate, one that has spawned accusations that opponents of the school are hostile to minority immigrants and are putting up ''not in my backyard'' roadblocks, as well as angry declarations by those opponents that the government is planning to pirate private property.</p>

        <p>In many neighborhoods, it would be an easy question to decide: Should a long-vacant property, centrally located in one of the city's most overcrowded school districts, be used for a new 900-seat elementary school or for a Staples office supply store?</p>
        <p>In Maspeth, Queens, just such a question has led to a wrenching debate, one that has spawned accusations that opponents of the school are hostile to minority immigrants and are putting up ''not in my backyard'' roadblocks, as well as angry declarations by those opponents that the government is planning to pirate private property.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, the City Council Land Use Committee unanimously approved an application by the School Construction Authority to build the 900-seat school on the site, at Grand Avenue and 72nd Place. If the full Council approves the proposal, which is considered likely, the Board of Education will either have to get the property's owner to agree to sell the site -- which so far appears unlikely -- or take possession of it under eminent domain. The Council is expected to vote on the school next week.</p>
        <p>The issues confronted yesterday are ones that the school board and communities throughout the city are likely to encounter with greater frequency in the coming years as the city faces a persistent crisis of overcrowded schools. With about one-third of the 32 community school districts operating above capacity, classrooms have been squeezed into converted bathrooms and utility closets, while trailers and other temporary buildings have taken over recreational space in many schoolyards.</p>
        <p>At the same time, many vacant properties around the city -- and particularly in Queens, the borough with the most crowded school districts and a rapidly growing immigrant and minority population -- are former industrial properties that are chemically contaminated and undesirable, if not unusable, for schools.</p>
        <p>Despite the overcrowding crisis, many residents of Maspeth say they prefer the building of a Staples store to a new school. They say a school will bring more traffic to two already clogged streets, slowing police and other emergency vehicles and endangering children and residents.</p>
        <p>Robert F. Holden, a vice chairman of Community Board 5, said in an interview that the suggestion that Maspeth residents were anti-immigrant or racist was an insult.</p>
        <p>''Instead of debating the issues, they smear us,'' Mr. Holden said. ''As a civic association president, I have to look at all the issues.</p>
        <p>''This is a case where there has been no civic planning,'' he said. ''The community of Maspeth opposes this because we live there. I want to know how many members of civic groups support this.''</p>
        <p>On the other side of the debate are the Board of Education, the parents of many of the schoolchildren in Community School District 24 and several local politicians, who express incredulity that some people think the community is more in need of paper clips and cheap pens than a place to teach children how to read.</p>
        <p>''I cannot understand how anyone would want a Staples rather than a school in this emergency situation,'' Claire Shulman, the Queens borough president, said Tuesday at a public hearing about the school application. ''On this site, in a neighborhood where the schools are so overburdened, the needs of children must come first.''</p>
        <p>Few people disagree that new schools are needed in Queens, where all seven school districts operate at or above capacity. District 24, which includes Maspeth, is at the top of the list; its 37,000 elementary and middle school students exceed the district's planned capacity by 20 percent.</p>
        <p>Since 1990, the Board of Education has added 12,500 seats in the district, said Patricia Zedalis, chief executive of the board's school facilities division. And while an additional 6,000 seats are scheduled to be added over the next four years, the board expects the student population to grow by 11,000 in that time.</p>
        <p>In June 1999, the Board of Education began pursuing use of the site, which contains the shell of a former Edwards Supermarket that closed in December 1997. But the board was six months too late for the property's owner, Benenson Capital, which in December 1998 signed a 20-year lease with Staples.</p>
        <p>Supporters and opponents of the school packed a public hearing at City Hall on Tuesday, and they disagreed on virtually every aspect of how the school would affect the neighborhood. Differing studies on traffic patterns and parking were offered, to applause and hoots from the audience members.</p>
        <p>Opponents mentioned the frequent accidents on heavily traveled Grand Avenue and the existence of what they called a ''hot sheets motel'' nearby as reasons that a school was inappropriate. They said a Staples would provide a much-needed economic lift to the area's businesses.</p>
        <p>There was an undercurrent of racial tension at the hearing, where those who opposed the school were largely white and elderly and most of those who supported the school were minorities. Maspeth, a blue-collar neighborhood whose ethnic mix is largely Italian, Irish, Polish and German, has recently become home to more Asian and Pacific immigrants and more apartments and multifamily dwellings are being built.</p>
        <p>People on both sides said that at a December hearing at Community Board 5, which voted against the school, several Maspeth residents said they feared the school would bring children from heavily immigrant neighborhoods into Maspeth.</p>
        <p>School officials say that children will not be bused to the school from faraway neighborhoods, but that the school will draw children from two nearby, overcrowded schools in neighborhoods with diverse student populations: P.S. 102 in Elmhurst, where 9 percent of the children are white, 31 percent are Hispanic and 57 percent are classified as ''Asian and other''; and P.S. 229 in Woodside, where 33 percent of the students are white, 38 percent are Hispanic and 27 percent are Asian and other. In each school, less than 2 percent of the students are black.</p>
        <p>But opponents of the school proposal also say that they have been unfairly criticized as being anti school, antichildren and anti-immigrant, particularly by people who favor the school but have never been to the site.</p>
