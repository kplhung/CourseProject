        <p>Five years ago, at a stationery store on the Left Bank, I picked up a copy of Paris Match, fished in my pants pocket for some francs and walked toward the counter, a smile of fear frozen on my face. As my brain locked, I croaked out this sentence to the old woman at the counter:</p>
        <p>''Je voudrais acheter ce magasin, s'il vous plait.''</p>

        <p>Five years ago, at a stationery store on the Left Bank, I picked up a copy of Paris Match, fished in my pants pocket for some francs and walked toward the counter, a smile of fear frozen on my face. As my brain locked, I croaked out this sentence to the old woman at the counter:</p>
        <p>''Je voudrais acheter ce magasin, s'il vous plait.''</p>
        <p>The common word for magazine is magazine (mah-gah-ZEEN), not magasin (mah-gah-ZAA). I had asked to buy the shop.</p>
        <p>And so it went. For 10 days in Paris I was a helpless prisoner of my past: four years of undistinguished high school French and one semester at college. I could make my way through a French newspaper, but conversation was out of the question.</p>
        <p>Until now. No longer the 98-pound-weakling of bilingualism, I have persuaded myself that it is possible to function confidently, perhaps even thrive, in another culture. I am a graduate of language immersion.</p>
        <p>Alas, I have no immediate plans to do much more than order en francais at a midtown restaurant. But others are looking forward to a fresh round of business travel, or a summer visit to France or Italy or Japan, and yearn to be more self-sufficient, even fluent. For them, language courses like the one in which I enrolled, offered by the Language Immersion Institute, function as an introduction, a brush-up or a steppingstone to broader learning. A friendly caution, however: in the elementary levels, a weekend in another language can saute your brain, leaving you momentarily mute and at least a half-sentence behind the person you're straining to understand. At times it's like trying to do long division in your head.</p>
        <p>My only previous encounter with immersion was a week at a tennis camp in Massachusetts years ago. Possessed of an average hacker's game at the time, I left the campus paralyzed by instruction. So focused had I become on where to step, how to swing and what my next shot should be that I couldn't hit the ball at all. Eventually the reflexes returned, including some bad habits. But it was demoralizing. Not so with French.</p>
        <p>In 15 hours of weekend conversation, the equivalent of one-third of a semester, my classmates and I were continually coaxed to struggle aloud. Mercifully, this was not like high school, where teenagers wince from embarrassment. I felt no trace of the angst of my sophomore year, when my teacher -- a humorless woman who looked like Howdy Doody with a gray wig and spoke French with an Indiana twang -- aimed her intolerance up and down the rows like a machine gunner.</p>
        <p>Instead, we were tutored by Denise Springer, a native speaker from the northeast seaside town of Berck-Plage in Flanders. A master teacher who retired in December as a language professor at the State University of New York at New Paltz, she happily transformed our gaucheries into new lines of instruction. We were applauded because we tried. It was O.K. to be ignorant. It was acceptable to be clumsy. We probably set a record for the number of sentences fractured per quarter-hour, but our persistence was always rewarded, with more instruction and more encouragement.</p>
        <p>'Hate to Make Mistakes'</p>
        <p>''It's a form of benign brainwashing,'' said Dr. Henry Urbanski, the director of the institute, which he founded on campus in 1981. The immersion technique isn't new, of course. In the 1960's, the Peace Corps placed its volunteers in similar programs. Among its most successful practitioners is the Defense Language Institute in Monterey, Calif., which trains the military.</p>
        <p>Dr. Urbanski, a walking advertisement for immersion, was born in Poland and speaks seven languages: English, French, German, Italian, Russian, Hebrew and Polish. He learned some of them, he says, by living in the country where the language is spoken.</p>
        <p>''I am a believer in learning the language when you have an urgency to use it, when you need to, when you're totally immersed in it,'' he said. But the program he established initially served another purpose as well.</p>
        <p>''I was chairman of the foreign language department at New Paltz in the late 70's, which coincided with the time that language requirements at colleges were being abolished,'' he said. ''We were experiencing a drop in students and a consequent drop in faculty members. I felt that we had some talented language teachers, and they had no students to teach. That's when I decided there's people out in the world who are no longer in school who need language instruction.''</p>
        <p>So what is immersion?</p>
        <p>''You exclude English for 15 hours in one weekend, and after a while students develop more confidence,'' he said. ''They are not afraid to speak and make mistakes and to try to communicate in the language.''</p>
        <p>That's the key: making mistakes.</p>
        <p>''Americans,'' he said, ''hate to make mistakes.''</p>
        <p>He's right. So on a recent Friday evening, my classmates and I left our pride at the door of the Dumont Plaza Hotel on East 34th Street.</p>
        <p>La Plume de Ma Tante? Non!</p>
        <p>We students, about 70 of us, and 10 or 12 instructors -- a fairly typical gathering for Manhattan -- arrived at a hotel conference room at 7 p.m.</p>
        <p>As individual classes go -- they range from 6 to 15 students -- mine was on the cozy side and fairly typical in its goals. Of the six of us, four wanted to learn more French for touring the country, one needed French for a doctoral program, and I was curious to see whether I was facile enough to move beyond irrelevant textbook phrases about le cahier, le stylo and mon oncle.</p>
        <p>In Manhattan, classes are held at the Dumont Plaza. The institute also conducts weekend instruction at the State University campus at New Paltz, at the nearby Mohonk Lake Mountain House and at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry. Instruction begins with Elementary I and Elementary II (my level) and two intermediate levels. There are also advanced immersion courses of two weeks and four weeks, at New Paltz. Most students in the Manhattan program are commuters, but some stay overnight at their own expense. Tuition was $295 for the weekend, which included a welcome break for bagels and coffee on Sunday morning.</p>
        <p>We began drifting into our meeting room in twos and threes, randomly filling seats and waiting to meet our teachers before following them to one-bedroom suites that would serve as classrooms.</p>
        <p>Dr. Urbanski's welcome was low-key. He urged us to shed our inhibitions and expectations, recalling Heywood Hale Broun's observation of his own language studies. Broun felt he had been a good student, Dr. Urbanski said, but complained that ''when he got to Paris he found that no one spoke intermediate French.''</p>
        <p>One by one, the instructors came forward to call the roll for their classes. They rattled off greetings and room numbers and a few phrases to lubricate us for what was to come.</p>
        <p>Mild panic swept the room, and someone who was dead serious yelled out, ''I think I'd better switch to Level I.''</p>
        <p>By 7:30 we were in our ''classrooms.'' My group was interrupted several times in the first hour by late arrivals, until finally 10 of us crowded into the suite's sitting room. We received paperback texts, introduced ourselves and talked in French about our jobs, worked on vocabulary and conversation, and adjourned at 10 p.m. With the exception of a few necessary instructions for the next day, Mme. Springer spoke only in French.</p>
        <p>One in Every Class</p>
        <p>When we reconvened at 9 a.m. on Saturday, there were just the six of us, the others having bailed out. (Most Friday night dropouts tend to sign up for lower-level instruction either the same weekend or at a future date, Dr. Urbanski said.) Our group was set: Vicky Jeffers, a psychologist from Morristown, N.J.; her friend Ann Elkas, a registered nurse from Chatham, N.J.; Mitzi Pratt, a bookbinder from Martha's Vineyard, Mass.; Debra Schmidt Bach, from Brooklyn, a curator at the South Street Seaport Museum; and Cellen (pronounced SELL-in) Wolk, a landscape gardener from Rockland County. They all knew I would be writing about our experience.</p>
        <p>We were pretty well matched, but the consensus was that Mitzi was the class genius. Her accent and pronunciation were quite good, and her command of sentence structure was superior to ours. She had spent some months working with a set of language tapes, and it had paid off.</p>
        <p>''I hadn't been to Europe for a while,'' she said, ''and then I went to France last fall for the grape harvest, the vendange. It was a great trip, and it inspired me to improve on the French that I had.''</p>
        <p>Her childhood French instruction, she said, had begun in a private, co-ed elementary school on the North Shore of Boston.</p>
        <p>Of her weekend at the Dumont Plaza, Mitzi said later: ''I was very nervous beforehand, but I had underestimated my ability. I had this vision of us sitting in this room being forced to speak French to each other.''</p>
        <p>Not Just a Bag</p>
        <p>That did, indeed, happen. But most of the time we interacted with Madame Springer, or created conversations at her direction.</p>
        <p>On Saturday morning, we paired off and interviewed our partners in French. Then we reported to the group. I learned that Ann was a nurse who also volunteered at a domestic-abuse phone line. She has three grown children, one of whom is married. She drives a Lexus and lives in a two-story house with four bedrooms.</p>
        <p>Now try saying that in French. In full sentences.</p>
        <p>More grist for Mme. Springer, who stood by a large easel and jotted down new words or phrases or verb forms with a marking pen. Nothing escaped her interest.</p>
        <p>At one point, she gestured to an oversize handbag on the floor near Vicky's chair. She referred to it as le sac, but then went on to explain that its size qualified it for what Parisians call by a slyly suggestive name that will not be repeated here. It is a prostitute's bag, big enough for a change of clothes, makeup, etc. Suddenly we were immersed not only in language but also in culture.</p>
        <p>Ann and Vicky were both relative newcomers to French. In school, Ann had studied Latin and taken a year of Spanish. Vicky said she had been a pretty fair student of German. ''I could think in German,'' she said. ''I could read poetry.''</p>
        <p>Both had been to France recently (''I fractured French there,'' Ann said) and wanted to become more comfortable with the language. So they enrolled together in a weekly hourlong course in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>''I wasn't getting enough conversation,'' Ann said. ''I'm great at visual learning, but my conversation is terrible. Just don't ask me to go, impromptu, into a big conversation with you.''</p>
        <p>We all survived the day. But when we left the hotel at 6 p.m. on Saturday, some of us displayed the telltale squint of fatigue.</p>
        <p>''When I drove home, my husband said I sat there like a lump, I was so tired.'' Ann said. ''I said, 'We're going out to eat, aren't we?' ''</p>
        <p>Say It Right, Mon Ami</p>
        <p>Food had been our salvation on Saturday afternoon, too. Mme. Springer, it seems, relishes lunchtime on an immersion weekend, and her favorite restaurant is a Theater District fixture, Pierre au Tunnel, on West 47th Street.</p>
        <p>Pierre Pujol opened the restaurant, on 48th Street, about 50 years ago, and it has remained in the family. Pujol's son-in-law, Jean-Claude Lincy, greeted us, and a member of the staff cheerfully put up with our attempts to order a tartine of this or a plat of that. We kept up some snappy table patter about de Gaulle, French socialism and Madame's wartime experiences in occupied France. But mercifully the food arrived, and it struck us all that it was the first time in hours that we had opened our mouths without having to think. (We split the bill, in English.)</p>
        <p>The biggest event of the weekend, though, was the dreaded oral report on Sunday. Mme. Springer had directed each of us to prepare a five-minute presentation. We were permitted to write it out the night before, but not to read from it in class.</p>
        <p>Vicky went first. Her report was on an American doughboy in Paris in 1918 and the penniless French countess he married. They eventually became her in-laws.</p>
        <p>''I was amazed that I could make the presentation and elaborate spontaneously,'' she said later. ''I felt comfortable.''</p>
        <p>Ann talked about her work as a volunteer with the domestic-abuse line. Cellen, the jardiniere, spoke lovingly about landscaping. It turned out that Cellen had been a competent Spanish speaker after having lived in Mexico years ago. But she had all but given up on French.</p>
        <p>''I had four years of first-year French in high school,'' she said, adding that her mother, a French teacher, seemed to think her daughter had no aptitude for language. After doing poorly in her first French class, she repeated French I the next year. Then she moved to a new school, and another French I class, and so on.</p>
        <p>But that was years ago, and with the prospect of a trip to Europe this summer, she chose to try immersion.</p>
        <p>''I began dreaming in French,'' she said, after a day of class.</p>
        <p>Mitzi told us about a trip to ancient ruins in Peru. I tried to describe a French cartoon character a friend had introduced me to. Named Becassine, she is a chauvinistic Bretonne in regional apron and cap whose exploits, chronicled in two dozen books, became popular between the world wars. (I had hoped for extra credit.)</p>
        <p>Debra is working toward her Ph.D. at Columbia University in the history of decorative arts, for which she must pass a French comprehension exam in the fall. She described a visit to Paris about 13 years ago, when she was in her 20's. ''On my way home one night,'' she said, ''I gave my address to a taxi driver, but apparently I didn't pronounce it properly. When I showed the correct address, he started yelling at me.''</p>
        <p>That night, she said, she dreamed that people were shouting at her in French. She awoke to find that, in fact, they were: her hotel was next to a noisy restaurant kitchen.</p>
        <p>The Secret, Revealed</p>
        <p>Which provoked a stern caution from Madame and may explain at long last why the French become frustrated with Americans. It's not because we take pratfalls in pursuit of fluency; it's because we make the sounds wrong.</p>
        <p>''Remember,'' she said, ''if you don't pronounce it correctly, the French simply won't understand you.'' It must have been important: she said this in English!</p>
        <p>By 1:30 on Sunday, exhausted but triumphant and with just 30 minutes remaining, we realized that making mistakes had not been so bad after all. We had stuttered and stumbled and persevered. And our teacher was still smiling.</p>
        <p>Our valedictory was brief but pleasant. We read poems and sang songs in unison -- a younger person's classroom activity, perhaps, but a curiously comfortable one -- and recited tongue twisters: ''Comment sont ces six saucissons-ci? Ces six saucissons-ci sont six sous.''</p>
        <p>There were hugs for the teacher, promises to enroll with her again and invitations to visit her in the Hudson Valley. And a valedictory of her own.</p>
        <p>''I am moved by the fact that people come and spend a weekend, people who have other interesting things to do,'' Mme. Springer would tell me later. ''If you are intelligent, you are self-criticizing, and it can work.</p>
        <p>''We never know exactly the level of the people when they enroll. Some people think they are better than they are. But most people are better than they think they are.''</p>
