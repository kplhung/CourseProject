      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The first half of ''The Well,'' the Australian director Samantha Lang's beautifully creepy debut feature, is an efficient study in the contrasting temperaments of two lonely women. Hester (Pamela Rabe), who lives with her father on a desolate sheep station, is the repressed one. We know this because of her long skirts and buttoned-up blouses, her orthopedic shoes and her flat, colorless hair, which she wears either severely plaited or gathered into a bun like the one Anthony Perkins sported in ''Psycho.'' Her taste in music runs to German lieder sung at dirge pace to the accompaniment of an out-of-tune upright piano.</p>
        <p>Katherine (Miranda Otto), her wayward young housekeeper, is the free spirit and resident life force. She loves loud rock music and likes to dance around in knee-high boots and short gauzy skirts. Her flaming red hair is the only splash of color on the dour, Victorian psychic landscape.</p>

        <p>The first half of ''The Well,'' the Australian director Samantha Lang's beautifully creepy debut feature, is an efficient study in the contrasting temperaments of two lonely women. Hester (Pamela Rabe), who lives with her father on a desolate sheep station, is the repressed one. We know this because of her long skirts and buttoned-up blouses, her orthopedic shoes and her flat, colorless hair, which she wears either severely plaited or gathered into a bun like the one Anthony Perkins sported in ''Psycho.'' Her taste in music runs to German lieder sung at dirge pace to the accompaniment of an out-of-tune upright piano.</p>
        <p>Katherine (Miranda Otto), her wayward young housekeeper, is the free spirit and resident life force. She loves loud rock music and likes to dance around in knee-high boots and short gauzy skirts. Her flaming red hair is the only splash of color on the dour, Victorian psychic landscape.</p>
        <p>But Hester loves Katherine. Or at least she buys her expensive gifts, excuses her from chores and learns, in her company, how to laugh. Bred in flinty pioneer thrift, Hester begins to spend money as if it were going out of style. She buys a brand-new silver Toyota pickup and, once her father dies, sells her childhood home and everything in it. Hester's disapproving financial adviser (Paul Chubb) suspects that Katherine has bewitched her, but the unlikely pair, along with two cookie tins full of cash, settle into a cozy cottage and begin fantasizing about a trip to Europe.</p>
        <p>Just as you begin to chafe at the obviousness of this setup, or to settle in for another hour of glum psychological atmospherics, Katherine runs over something -- which turns out to be someone -- on a deserted dirt road, and ''The Well,'' with a neck-snapping jolt, turns into the scariest exercise in cinematic sleight of hand since ''The Blair Witch Project.'' Soon there is a body to be disposed of, and the deep, dry well in front of the cottage offers itself as a practical solution and as a metaphor for the murky terror that is about to unfold.</p>
        <p>Katherine begins to insist that the man in the well is alive and that he has fallen in love with her. Surely she's come unhinged. Or maybe Hester, who either believes Katherine or doesn't, has gone over the edge. Or maybe you're the crazy one. Strange things begin to happen, unless nothing is happening at all. The story, adapted by Laura Jones from a novel by Elizabeth Jolley, is like a chain of slipknots, drawing ever tighter until one by one they disappear.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lang brings this puzzle to the screen with mathematical discipline and painterly emotion. She charges the smallest interactions with unbearable tension and knows how to induce panic by suggesting rather than showing. Like Peter Weir in ''Picnic at Hanging Rock,'' she turns the empty, windy outback into an actively sinister presence.</p>
        <p>Stumbling into ''The Well,'' which opens today at the Screening Room, you feel you've awakened into someone else's nightmare, and you emerge from it clammy with a dread you don't quite understand. See it with someone you trust. Or better, see it alone, since afterward you won't be able to trust anything, least of all your own perceptions.</p>
