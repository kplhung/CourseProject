        <p>A mother and son described by prosecutors as a prolific and pitiless con artist team were convicted yesterday of murdering a wealthy socialite as part of an intricate scheme to steal her Upper East Side townhouse.</p>
        <p>The conviction of the mother and son, Sante and Kenneth Kimes, was a triumph for Manhattan prosecutors who brought a rare type of murder case: one in which the body was never found, and one built entirely on circumstantial evidence. Prosecutors said it was the first case in New York, and one of only a handful in the nation, in which murder convictions were won without a body, an eyewitness, a confession or any forensic evidence.</p>
        <p>But investigators said that the pair's murder of the woman, Irene Silverman, 82, was just one of a number of crimes: by the time the Kimeses arrived in New York in June 1998, they had left behind what investigators described as a huge mosaic of fraud, theft, arson, identity theft and murder that stretched from Hawaii to Las Vegas to the Bahamas. They now face a murder trial in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Interviews and a review of court records revealed a story of a tyrannical mother and a malleable son caught in a bizarre relationship, living a life of scams and aliases.</p>
        <p>After reaching yesterday's verdict, jurors called the evidence against the Kimeses overwhelming. They said their first vote for a murder conviction was unanimous, even though the body of the victim has never been found. [Page B4.]</p>
        <p>Mrs. Silverman was last seen on July 5, 1998, and the Kimeses were charged with murder in December 1998 in an indictment that outlined a plot involving disguises, false identities, tapped telephones, forged deeds, false addresses and burglaries.</p>
        <p>The jurors said the most damning pieces of evidence presented by prosecutors during the three-month trial were 14 notebooks with detailed lists and notes written by Mrs. Kimes.  Prosecutors contended that the notes pointed to an elaborate scheme to murder Mrs. Silverman and steal her $7.7 million Upper East Side townhouse.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kimes, 65, blinked, rocked forward slightly and then sat motionless as the first of a total of 118 guilty verdicts for her and her son were read aloud in a packed courtroom in the Manhattan Criminal Courts Building yesterday afternoon. Mr. Kimes, 25, who struggled to contain his emotions throughout the trial, winced and swallowed as the first guilty verdict for murder was read.</p>
        <p>As the jury forewoman continued announcing guilty verdict after guilty verdict for 20 minutes, Mr. Kimes turned to his mother, said ''Mom, it'll be O.K.,'' then frantically talked with his lawyers. The Kimeses were found guilty of murder, robbery, burglary, conspiracy, grand larceny, illegal weapons possession, forgery and eavesdropping. They both face 25 years to life in prison on the most serious charge of murder and will be sentenced by Justice Rena K. Uviller of State Supreme Court on June 27.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kimes's compulsive note-taking, which she continued throughout the trial, appeared to be her downfall. In the notebooks, Mrs. Kimes repeatedly wrote reminders like ''get s.s. #,'' ''get keys,'' ''get signature,'' and ''get checks.'' Her lists included items like: ''when goes to sleep,'' ''blood type,'' ''what kind of movies does she like?'' ''any exits in her apt.?'' ''is there a burglar alarm in her apt.'' and ''help there on weekends?'' On another list, Mrs. Kimes wrote, ''get Lincoln,'' ''practice,'' and ''park close,'' references to the Kimeses' plans for murdering Mrs. Silverman and disposing of her body.</p>
        <p>''They kept writing 'get her Social Security number,' '' said Michael Alvarez, a juror who lives on the Upper West Side and is a librarian. ''There was a lot of evidence, so for us, it wasn't that difficult.''</p>
        <p>The Kimeses' lawyers said they would appeal the verdict, but their clients now face trial in Los Angeles in the fatal shooting of a longtime friend and former business partner of Mrs. Kimes's late husband. If convicted in that case, Mr. Kimes, who is charged with being the gunman, could face the death penalty.</p>
        <p>In an interview after the verdict, a visibly stunned Mrs. Kimes called the 118 guilty verdicts a ''temporary setback.'' She predicted that she would win her appeal and insisted that she and her son had been framed by the police. ''I want to cry out for help to anyone in the country who believes in justice to help us, help us,'' Mrs. Kimes said as tears welled in her eyes.</p>
        <p>Michael Hardy, a defense lawyer in the Silverman case, complained that a ruling by Justice Uviller prevented Mrs. Kimes from taking the witness stand in her own defense. He said that the ruling would be the main basis for the defense's appeal.</p>
        <p>''That made it impossible for her to testify and have the jury see her testimony as having any integrity,'' Mr. Hardy said.</p>
        <p>But prosecutors said the Silverman plot was the culmination of a wide-ranging crime spree by the couple. In September 1996, the mother and son fled Nassau, the Bahamas, before the Bahamian authorities could question them in the disappearance of a banker.</p>
        <p>They left the West Coast in April 1998, after killing the longtime former business partner of Mrs. Kimes's late husband and dumping his body near the Los Angeles Airport, prosecutors there said. In Baton Rouge, La., they bought a $80,000 motor home from a dealer with a rubber check. The motor home was found abandoned in Florida. By mid-June, the Kimeses were in New York.</p>
        <p>Once in Manhattan, the Kimeses tracked down Mrs. Silverman, a woman the pair had heard about at an anti-aging conference in Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>When they were arrested in Midtown Manhattan shortly after Mrs. Silverman's disappearance on an unrelated warrant for passing a bad $14,000 check in Utah, the Kimeses were carrying Mrs. Silverman's keys, passport, Social Security card and bank books. In a folder marked ''Final Dynasty,'' investigators found what they said was a forged deed selling Mrs. Silverman's $7.7 million mansion at 20 East 65th Street to their off-shore corporation, for only $395,000.</p>
        <p>Jose Alvarez, a man who traveled with the Kimeses to New York, testified that Mr. Kimes announced, ''this would be a good place to hide a body'' while driving through New Jersey. But the most chilling evidence was the notebooks.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Silverman's home, which friends said was the center of her life, now sits empty. Its lone resident is Mrs. Silverman's longtime caretaker, Mengistu Melesse, an earnest and soft-spoken man whom jurors called one of their favorite witness. Jurors said they were struck by the way Mrs. Silverman's employees said she generously treated them and how they spoke so warmly of her.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Silverman left all of her property, including her town house, to the Coby Foundation, a nonprofit charity she established to honor the work of her mother, an embroiderer, and others in the field. What will become of the mansion is up to the foundation's board, according to lawyers administering Mrs. Silverman's estate.</p>
        <p>Carol Hansen, a close friend of Mrs. Silverman who was with her on the night before she disappeared, said she was overwhelmed by the guilty verdict, but still haunted by the loss of a spirited woman who rose from a family of New Orleans needle workers, to a Radio City Music Hall dancer, to a generous host and benefactor.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately, it's a bittersweet victory. Irene is gone,'' Ms. Hansen said in a halting voice. ''Just put a note in there about how much we all love Irene. She was a remarkable woman.''</p>
