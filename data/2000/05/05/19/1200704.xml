        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Paul Krugman (column, May 17) suggests that the market's current overvaluation makes this an inappropriate time to invest Social Security in stocks. Much as I agree with his valuation assessment, participant contributions to the proposed plan  would be only 2 percentage points of the 12.4 percent payroll tax.</p>
        <p>It's not that significant amounts must suddenly be invested at inflated market levels. Rather, this amount (presumably adjusted for inflation) would be invested yearly throughout a participant's 40-year working life, which would smooth the ups and downs of the market over time.</p>

        <p>Historically, from almost any starting point, long-term returns have exceeded the 1.5 percent that a current participant realizes on his or her Social Security contributions.</p>
