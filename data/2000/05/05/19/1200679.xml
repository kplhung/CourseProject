        <p>The new new thing is a lighter, sleeker version of a traditional child's toy, the scooter.

        <p>It's not often that Chelsea sophisticates, Midtown commuters and 10-year-old Upper East Siders are after the same hot item. But there it is. And there. And there.</p>
        <p>The new new thing is a lighter, sleeker version of a traditional child's toy, the scooter. Newly endowed with Rollerblade-style wheels, snowboard decks and aircraft-quality steel frames, human-powered scooters, propelled by scuffing foot against pavement, have shot to the top of the Sharper Image sales chart. Small sports boutiques can hardly keep them in stock. Associations, organized outings and a scooter-mounted police unit can't be far behind.</p>
        <p>Like a horde of vernal messengers, they have invaded the city: a lone woman in skirt and hat cutting through a sunny stretch of SoHo, a posse of Chinese boys with severe dye jobs doing 180's near the Brooklyn Bridge, a laughing young professional using hers as a laundry cart. Anyone can ride; it is a skateboard with safety rails. No aptitude required.</p>
        <p>The clamor for scooters began during last winter's holiday season, and with the onset of warm weather, it has amplified. ''By this summer, it's going to be very hot,'' said James Yu, who with his wife, Jill, owns and runs Basic Wheels, a shop on the Lower East Side. ''By this Christmas, forget it.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Yu said, ''Our oldest customer on the Razor is 65. Our youngest is 5.''</p>
        <p>At about $119, the tiny, zeppelin-silver Razor Rollerboard is the cheapest and most popular of a fleet of new scooter designs. The Xootr is a classic-looking plaything that comes in birch, aluminum and -- soon -- carbon fiber. And the Kickboard has a flexible deck made like a snowboard that was designed for those who want to try stunts.</p>
        <p>At the Taiwan Bike Fair in April, 54 companies had scooters, said Graham Jacobson, an Upper East Side toy marketer who could be seen, on a recent sunny afternoon, turning heads on a crowded Fifth Avenue sidewalk with his own scooter prototype, the 900R.</p>
        <p>The trend first erupted in Japan, despite the fact that city sidewalks there are so crowded with women teetering on eight-inch platform shoes that it is impossible to walk, much less roll. Then Australia went mad for scooters.</p>
        <p>New York is in third place, at best, on this one, though there are unconfirmed reports that scooter stowaways made their first United States appearance in California, where it was feared they would drive out native species like in-line skates.</p>
        <p>In the world of things with little wheels, scooters have certain practical advantages. They fold up when not in use. There are no heavy boots to pry off. No ambulances have yet borne wounded scooter enthusiasts from Central Park, according to the police unit there.</p>
        <p>But to some aficionados, ease and efficiency are trumped by style.</p>
        <p>After seeing pictures of scooters in magazines from Hong Kong, Mio Yip, 21, a student at the Fashion Institute of Technology, was so eager to get a head start on the trend that he bought a Razor in the dead of winter. Friends followed suit, and now a group of early twentysomethings that includes Web designers, students and hairstylists meets near the Grand Street subway station once a week to ''tai ye,'' which they say is Chinese for ''roll around.''</p>
        <p>Along with their Stussy snowboarding pants, wrist computers and wraparound sunglasses, the group's Razors seemed like just another accessory. The young men, many of whom have abandoned their in-line skates, had customized their scooters with headlights and translucent grips meant for bicycles, sparkly sandpaper of the sort used on skateboards, bright stickers and spray-painted samurai.</p>
        <p>On a recent Thursday, Kevin Ng, 24, a computer network administrator, watched his friends practice flying off curbs and worried that their stunts were not ready for prime time. ''This is so new,'' he said apologetically. ''We're still trying to perfect these jumps.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ng might well fret: despite their high cool quotient, scooter traveling can look and feel a little goofy, the wheeled equivalent of skipping.</p>
        <p>''You only look chic when you're standing on the street corner with it,'' said Dave Allaband, who works at Freakatorium, a downtown memorabilia shop. ''You don't look chic when you're actually trying to go somewhere.'' Mr. Allaband favors a motorized Zappy scooter, which requires no unseemly exertion.</p>
        <p>There are those, though, who revel in the puckish thrill of gliding where mere mortals only plod. Jen Banbury, a 33-year-old novelist who bought her Razor on the recommendation of a traveling Australian, said she did not mind looking childlike. ''It kind of changed the way I experienced Manhattan,'' she said. ''The movement is just really magical. When you're on a roll it feels kind of dreamlike, the way you get to float down the sidewalk but still get to see everything from that pedestrian level.''</p>
        <p>According to Ms. Yu, the scooter customers at Basic Wheels fit into one of two camps: the style mavens and the ''recreated hippies'' who are interested in eco-friendly transportation. Keith Strahan, a soft-spoken artist and the sort of man who has to do some math before he can tell you his age (he came up with 42), places himself in the second camp. But Mr. Strahan, at more than 6 feet tall, is too big for a compact scooter. For the last couple of months, he and his son Rex, 4, have been cruising their Brooklyn neighborhood, Williamsburg, on a Know-Ped, a broad-decked scooter that was created by taking the motor off the Go-Ped, a gasoline-powered scooter. The Know-Ped is to the little Razor what a wood-paneled station wagon is to a Suzuki Ninja.</p>
        <p>''It is one of those things that makes you feel like you're having fun again,'' Mr. Strahan said. ''It puts some enjoyment into having to go get some bananas at the store.''</p>
        <p>Of course scooters have their limitations. They are not built for long commutes, and smaller models require a lot of effort. Hide Tanaka, 42, a jazz bassist who tried the Razor after seeing it on Japanese television, said skates were still better for covering a lot of ground. ''A scooter is like half of a Rollerblade,'' he said, catching his breath on a Chelsea pier.</p>
        <p>There is also the problem that every early adapter suffers: watching everybody else catch on. Ms. Banbury, the novelist, seemed resigned to sharing the scooter's charms.</p>
        <p>''I get really angry when things I like get popular,'' Ms. Banbury said. ''But in this case I realize that it's not really fair. The first guys on bicycles probably thought they were pretty cool, too.''</p>
