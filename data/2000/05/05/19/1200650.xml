        <p>The Columbia/HCA Healthcare Corporation, the nation's largest health care company, has agreed in principle to pay $745 million in civil penalties to settle part of a broad government inquiry into whether its success was achieved in part by cheating federal health programs.</p>
        <p>The settlement, if ultimately approved, will be by far the largest health care fraud settlement ever obtained by the Justice Department, exceeding the next highest by more than 50 percent.</p>
        <p>But the deal announced yesterday does not bring an end to the sprawling investigations into the health care company, some of which have lasted more than seven years. Criminal and other civil investigations into some of the company's business practices remain unresolved.</p>
        <p>The settlement addresses civil allegations that the company fraudulently increased patient billings to the government from its hospitals and home health care businesses, and charged for unnecessary laboratory tests. The allegations that remain unsettled have long been at the heart of the case: whether Columbia hospitals fraudulently overstated their expenses to increase reimbursement from Medicare and other federal health programs and engaged in illegal financial relationships with doctors.</p>
        <p>Still, yesterday's deal included an unusual structure that would put immense pressure on both Columbia and the government to resolve the entire case before the end of this year.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the agreement, the criminal cases against Columbia must be settled by Dec. 31. If that does not happen -- or if the government does not grant certain extensions of time for negotiations -- Columbia can withdraw the settlement offer.</p>
        <p>In other words, if the two sides do not resolve the criminal case this year, the government stands to lose hundreds of millions of dollars, while Columbia would return to square one in the negotiating process -- or be on its way to trial.</p>
        <p>''It's an elegantly crafted settlement to put the arm on everybody to get the rest of the deal done,'' said Stephen Meagher, a lawyer who represents some of the people who first brought allegations of fraud at Columbia to the government's attention. ''It's a settlement time bomb.''</p>
        <p>The Justice Department issued a statement yesterday acknowledging generally that a tentative agreement had been reached with Columbia on certain issues. Officials declined to comment further, as did Michael Chertoff, a lead lawyer in Columbia's defense efforts.</p>
        <p>Victor Campbell, a senior Columbia executive, said that the company had hoped to settle the entire case but that both sides had decided to announce the progress so far. ''Our goal had been to get a total global settlement,'' he said. ''But we were at a point in time on three areas where we felt we could get a settlement and thought we should proceed with that.''</p>
        <p>Until yesterday, the largest health care fraud settlement was for $486 million, by Fresenius Medical Care A.G., the nation's largest provider of dialysis services. The settlement, which was announced in January, involved allegations of fraud at National Medical Care, a dialysis provider that was being investigated by the government when it was bought by Fresenius in 1996.</p>
        <p>The three areas covered by the tentative settlement in the Columbia/HCA case all involve technical financial issues that the government contends resulted in overpayments to Columbia by federal health programs.</p>
        <p>The first of those areas involves a practice known as upcoding, in which hospitals receive larger payments from Medicare by inflating the seriousness of illnesses they treat. A 1997 computer analysis by The New York Times of more than 30 million billing records found that many Columbia hospitals billed Medicare for high-paying treatments far more often than competing hospitals serving similar populations. The federal authorities at the time called such findings an indication of possible overbilling.</p>
        <p>The second portion of the settlement addressed allegations of fraud in Columbia's laboratories. In this area, Columbia is facing allegations that have been made against several other health care companies. Over the last decade, these other companies have settled charges that they improperly ''bundled'' additional and unnecessary diagnostic analysis onto simple blood tests -- in the end billing the government for the unneeded tests.</p>
        <p>The last area of the settlement, involving Columbia's home health care business, is the most complex. Home care reimbursement from the government is based on expenses reported to the federal health authorities in documents called cost reports. But the government has contended that Columbia fraudulently added improper expenses onto the home care business to increase reimbursement.</p>
        <p>This settlement, according to the company, would resolve allegations that Columbia's home care business reported expenses for marketing in its cost reports as being for community education -- a shift that through the federal formula would result in higher reimbursements.</p>
        <p>The home care settlement would also settle allegations that a series of 1994 transactions between Columbia and a home care manager, then known as Olsten Kimberly, had been improperly structured to maximize management fees to Olsten -- fees the government would partly reimburse -- and minimize other expenses that brought less, if any, reimbursement.</p>
        <p>Finally, the home care settlement would settle allegations that Columbia fraudulently billed for services to patients who did not qualify for such care.</p>
        <p>Analysts have long expected that one portion of the investigation that now remains unresolved could cost Columbia hundreds of millions of dollars alone. That portion, involving cost-reporting fraud by the company's hospitals, has already led to criminal convictions of executives at one Columbia hospital in Florida. Mr. Campbell of Columbia declined to discuss whether the company had any projections for the ultimate cost of settling all of the investigations.</p>
        <p>Yesterday's announcement served as a denouement for Richard L. Scott, the former chairman of Columbia who was once celebrated as a visionary reformer of the hospital industry but who was ultimately forced to resign under pressure as allegations of wrongdoing at his company mounted.</p>
        <p>In less than a decade, Mr. Scott had built a company he founded with two small hospitals in El Paso into the world's largest health care company -- a $20 billion giant with about 350 hospitals, 550 home health care offices and scores of other medical businesses in 38 states.</p>
        <p>The company held itself out as a model for the increasingly cost-conscious world of health care, applying the competitive practices of corporate America to an industry still dominated by nonprofit institutions.</p>
        <p>But by 1997, Mr. Scott's dream was unraveling. In July of that year, law enforcement agents raided Columbia offices and hospitals in seven states, seizing documents related to business practices. Mr. Scott played down the action, saying that investigations were common in health care.</p>
        <p>But the company's board saw it differently. In a matter of weeks, Mr. Scott was pushed to resign. He was replaced by Dr. Thomas F. Frist Jr., a co-founder of the Hospital Corporation of America, the granddaddy of the profit-making hospital corporations, which Columbia acquired in 1994.</p>
