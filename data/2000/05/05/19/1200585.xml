        <p>Investigators from the European Commission raided Coca-Cola's office in Brussels early yesterday as well as the office of the company's largest bottler, in London, expanding an inquiry into Coke's marketing practices that began last summer.</p>
        <p>At issue are many of the methods Coke uses to bolster sales of its soft drinks: contracts that prohibit competitors' products, sales incentive programs and discounts for certain customers. Last July, investigators seized documents from the offices of Coca-Cola Beverages in London; the offices of Coke's principal German bottler, Coca-Cola Erfrischungsgetranke, and Coca-Cola Nordic Beverages in Denmark.</p>
        <p>By bringing Coca-Cola Enterprises into the investigation, regulators seem intent on examining the entire European operation. Coca-Cola Enterprises, based in Atlanta, bottles Coke products in France, Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg, and controls about 70 percent of Coke's bottling in the United States.</p>
        <p>In a statement, the European Commission said its inquiry ''aims to assess whether C.C.E.'s distribution practices may constitute an abuse of a dominant position in violation of E.U. competition rules.'' It added that the investigation focused on the Belgian and British markets, and began after complaints were received by the commission. Pepsico and Virgin Cola have acknowledged that they complained to regulators about Coke, setting off the investigation in July.</p>
        <p>Coca-Cola said it was cooperating with the authorities. ''We are confident that our actions are in compliance with all national and European regulations,'' said the company's spokesman, Rob Baskin.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises, confirmed that regulators had entered its offices in London and Brussels. ''We are disappointed that the European Commission felt the need to execute a dawn raid,'' said the spokesman, John H. Downs Jr. ''However, we are not surprised that the commission included our European operations since it has a continuing investigation into the Coca-Cola system.''</p>
        <p>The investigators remained at the Coke offices throughout the day, examining files and removing documents that pertained to the inquiry, which has no deadline. ''The length of investigations depends largely on complexity of cases, and on whether the commission's suspicions turn out to be justified,'' the commission said in its statement.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, Coca-Cola Enterprises disclosed that its profits were falling, citing a flood of cheaper products into Britain, the bottler's second-biggest market. European Union law permits companies based in one country to import products from other member nations, so the bottler cannot prevent the flow of soft drinks from countries like Spain or Ireland.</p>
        <p>Mr. Downs said there was ''no connection'' between the cheaper imports and the European Union's inquiry into Coca-Cola Enterprises.</p>
        <p>Coca-Cola's new chairman and chief executive, Douglas N. Daft, has pledged to improve the company's battered image in Europe as well as its conduct there. Coke's efforts in recent years to buy Orangina and the Cadbury Schweppes brands ran into trouble from regulators on competitive grounds, with the plans ultimately scuttled or trimmed back. Last June, Coke recorded its biggest product recall in company history after people in Belgium said they felt ill after drinking Coke products; the recall cost Coke $200 million and cost Coca-Cola Enterprises $103 million.</p>
        <p>In December, Italian authorities fined Coke $16 million over the practices of Coca-Cola Beverages, a bottler in which Coke holds a majority stake. The authorities objected to several of the bottler's practices, including discounts to retailers carrying Coca-Cola products exclusively and year-end bonuses to wholesalers carrying only Coca-Cola. The investigation began in 1997 after complaints from Pepsi and an Italian supermarket chain, Esselunga.</p>
        <p>''Nineteen ninety-nine was a pretty tough year for Coca-Cola, particularly in Europe,'' Mr. Daft told the British and American Chamber of Commerce earlier this month. ''We've said the series of setbacks we suffered last year served as a clear wake-up call for us.''</p>
