        <p>FOR Memorial Day last year, organizers of a safety campaign enlisted thousands of police agencies to spot people who were not wearing seat belts or had not buckled up small children. This year, the campaign is enlisting millions of drivers, as well.</p>
        <p>The Air Bag and Seat Belt Safety Campaign has established a toll-free line (1-800-764-5755) that people can call from May 22 to May 29 if they see a child who is not properly buckled. If the caller can give the license plate number and describe the vehicle, the campaign will send a letter to the vehicle owner that says, in part: ''There are laws in all 50 states that require children to be buckled up. While the laws vary from state to state by what age and size child they cover, the laws of physics are the same everywhere.</p>

        <p>FOR Memorial Day last year, organizers of a safety campaign enlisted thousands of police agencies to spot people who were not wearing seat belts or had not buckled up small children. This year, the campaign is enlisting millions of drivers, as well.</p>
        <p>The Air Bag and Seat Belt Safety Campaign has established a toll-free line (1-800-764-5755) that people can call from May 22 to May 29 if they see a child who is not properly buckled. If the caller can give the license plate number and describe the vehicle, the campaign will send a letter to the vehicle owner that says, in part: ''There are laws in all 50 states that require children to be buckled up. While the laws vary from state to state by what age and size child they cover, the laws of physics are the same everywhere.</p>
        <p>''We'd like to remind you that it is extremely dangerous for children to ride unbuckled in motor vehicles. You could have been stopped by authorities and ticketed, resulting in a fine or points on your license. If a crash had occurred, the child could have been seriously injured or killed.''</p>
        <p>The campaign has access to the motor vehicle registration records in 40 states, including Connecticut and New Jersey. (Laws in New York and nine other states do not allow access.) The program is to be announced Monday by the Transportation Department, but letters later sent to motorists will specify that they are not from a government agency, and that no government agency will be notified.</p>
        <p>''We expect a certain segment of the population that will not like this,'' said Janet Goss, a spokeswoman for the campaign. But many people will be eager to call: The campaign has surveyed adults on their attitudes toward unbuckled babies and small children, and ''four-fifths of them think it's tantamount to child endangerment.''</p>
        <p>People who complain about others who do not follow the law are not butting in, she said. ''I can say, 'I mind very much if you smoke,' '' Ms. Goss said. ''I should be able to say, 'I mind very much if you drive with kids unbuckled.' ''</p>
