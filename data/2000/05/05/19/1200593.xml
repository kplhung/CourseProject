        <p>Hipolito Mejia's path to the Dominican presidency was cleared of its last obstacle today when his opponent from the governing party declined to seek a runoff, averting what he said could be a prolonged and costly electoral crisis.</p>
        <p>With virtually all the votes tallied, Mr. Mejia, the candidate of the Dominican Revolutionary Party, was first with 49.87 percent. Danilo Medina of the ruling Dominican Liberation Party was second with 24.94 percent, and Joaquin Balaguer, the blind nonagenarian and seven-time former president, had 24.6 percent.</p>
        <p>At an early morning news conference, Mr. Medina said that while it was clear to him that Mr. Mejia had not won an outright majority, a June 30 runoff would have cost too much in time, money and tension, adding that a continued campaign would have hurt the economy.</p>
        <p>Although his announcement was praised by some as an elegant exit, it drew jeers from party militants, who heckled him with shouts of ''traitor'' and repeated cries for a runoff.</p>
        <p>Leaders of the Dominican Liberation Party, or P.L.D., said their decision came after Mr. Balaguer had warned them on Wednesday night that he could not guarantee that all members of his Social Christian Reformist Party would support Mr. Medina in the runoff. The absence of a solid alliance would have guaranteed a victory for the Dominican Revolutionary Party, or P.R.D.</p>
        <p>''The program of the P.L.D. is for the general good of the country and not for our organization's or any individual's interest,'' Mr. Medina said. ''The leaders of our party decided not to create problems in the Dominican Republic and acknowledge the victory of the P.R.D.''</p>
        <p>Although the electoral council still needs several more days to certify the election formally, Mr. Medina's departure from the race sets the stage for Mr. Mejia's inauguration on Aug. 16.</p>
        <p>When he and his vice president, Milagros Ortiz Bosch, take office, they will preside over an economy whose phenomenal growth presents them with the challenge of providing improved social services to the thousands of Dominicans who supported them. Befitting his background in agriculture and past service as minister of agriculture, Mr. Mejia said he would find ways to help farmers who have been hurt by the privatization of state-run enterprises in sugar production and the nearly fourfold increase in food imports since 1996.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ortiz Bosch said their administration would have to spur housing construction as well as improve delivery of electricity and water, all part of their vow to provide better opportunities to the vast majority of residents who have not benefited from the robust economy.</p>
        <p>''This country needs 750,000 units of new housing, we have a deteriorated health system and social security covers only 6 percent of the population,'' she said. ''Apart from economic growth, we have not had economic development.''</p>
        <p>In a departure from the country's history of acrimonious relations with Haiti, its impoverished neighbor, Ms. Ortiz Bosch said their administration would seek to help it, enlisting the support of the international community. She raised the possibility of relocating assembly plants to the border and easing travel rules to allow Haitians to come in and work for the day.</p>
        <p>The new government's ability to fulfill those promises will be closely watched, although improving the circumstances of older residents who have been on the economic margins for decades could prove difficult.</p>
        <p>''This is a fairly affluent country, yet you still have a terribly high level of social debt that has to be paid on education and other programs,'' a diplomat said. ''How do you deal with those workers who are between 25 and 45 years old, a large number of semiliterate people who do not have many skills? In any country it's hard to include people who were left out in the past during a rapidly changing economy.''</p>
        <p>Members of several delegations of observers said that despite the cumbersome electoral process, which included long waits and numerous double checks of voter cards and lists to prevent corruption, the vote was carried out smoothly and fairly.</p>
        <p>To some extent, the absence of  major problems reflected the country's economic good times, said Bernardo Vega, a former Dominican ambassador to the United States.</p>
        <p>''Today, a service economy dependent on tourism, business and an assembly sector that can leave the country and relocate elsewhere produces and economic model that implicitly needs political stability,'' he said. ''These elections reflected that.''</p>
