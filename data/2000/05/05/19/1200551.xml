        <p>STUDEBAKER owners are a stubborn, iconoclastic group. John Cohoe, a founder of the Manhattan Studebaker Club, said: ''One of the early mottoes was, 'We'd rather fix than switch.' And some cigarette smokers in the club would only smoke Lark. I guess they've grown up to Avanti cigars now.''</p>
        <p>Studebaker was one of the great independents in American automaking. The company started out as a wagon maker in 1852 and built its first car, an electric, in 1902. The last Studebaker rolled off the line in 1966. Notable Studebakers over the years include the big eight-cylinder Presidents of the 1920's and 1930's, the economical 1939 Champion, the 1950 ''bullet nose'' (named for its unusual round grille), the 1953 Starlight coupe and Starliner hardtop, the compact 1959 Lark and the wedge-shaped Avanti of 1963.</p>

        <p>Studebaker was one of the great independents in American automaking. The company started out as a wagon maker in 1852 and built its first car, an electric, in 1902. The last Studebaker rolled off the line in 1966. Notable Studebakers over the years include the big eight-cylinder Presidents of the 1920's and 1930's, the economical 1939 Champion, the 1950 ''bullet nose'' (named for its unusual round grille), the 1953 Starlight coupe and Starliner hardtop, the compact 1959 Lark and the wedge-shaped Avanti of 1963.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, from about 11 a.m. to 4 p.m., the 35-member Manhattan Studebaker club will show off cars like these on the north side of Pier 17 at the South Street Seaport. The emphasis of the show, which is free, will be on Studebakers and other ''orphan'' makes whose manufacturers are no longer in business, but any car built in 1974 or earlier can enter for a fee of $15, Mr. Cohoe said. Thirty to 50 cars are expected, he added.</p>
        <p>Old-car shows are a rarity in Manhattan, not the friendliest of places for any car, especially one that's 40 or 50 years old. ''Owning an old car is the dream of childhood come true, and Manhattanites don't tend to be that type of person,'' said Gary Hallgren, another founder of the Manhattan Studebaker Club. ''They dream of old cars, but the price of realizing that dream is too high. If they are native New Yorkers, it's not in their blood as much as us hick country people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hallgren's tongue was firmly in cheek. Although he now lives in Mastic Beach on Long Island, and grew up in Ferndale, Wash., he lived in Manhattan for nine years and kept a Studebaker in the city the whole time. In fact, he parked his 1949 pickup on the street and never even locked it. And nothing ever happened to it.</p>
        <p>''A bum slept in it once,'' he said, ''but I didn't care.''</p>
