        <p>With glowing reviews and some help from a Hollywood legend, the Encores! concert series's production of ''Wonderful Town,'' which had a brief run at City Center two weeks ago, may be headed for Broadway.</p>
        <p>Talks were under way this week between City Center officials and several groups of producers, including Anita Waxman, Elizabeth P. Williams and Fran and Barry Weissler, to move the musical to a Broadway house in late fall. Rehearsals would probably begin soon after the production's director, Kathleen Marshall, completes her work as choreographer on ''Seussical,'' a new musical due in October.</p>

        <p>With glowing reviews and some help from a Hollywood legend, the Encores! concert series's production of ''Wonderful Town,'' which had a brief run at City Center two weeks ago, may be headed for Broadway.</p>
        <p>Talks were under way this week between City Center officials and several groups of producers, including Anita Waxman, Elizabeth P. Williams and Fran and Barry Weissler, to move the musical to a Broadway house in late fall. Rehearsals would probably begin soon after the production's director, Kathleen Marshall, completes her work as choreographer on ''Seussical,'' a new musical due in October.</p>
        <p>''I think it would be great for us and great for the company,'' said Judith Daykin, the president of City Center. ''But it's very early in the talking stages.''</p>
        <p>What is known is that ''Wonderful Town'' would be a joint effort of City Center and outside producers. Several people privy to negotiations said that one of the quiet instigators and financial backers of a Broadway run was Paul Newman, whose wife, Joanne Woodward, is on the City Center and Encores! boards. Calls to Mr. Newman's agent, Sam Cohn, were not returned.</p>
        <p>''Wonderful Town,'' with music by Leonard Bernstein and lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green, follows two sisters from Ohio loose in the big city. The show, with Rosalind Russell as the wisecracking Ruth and Edie Adams as her younger, dreamier sister, Eileen, opened at the Winter Garden in February 1953 and ran for 559 performances.</p>
        <p>In the Encores! incarnation Donna Murphy played Ruth and Laura Benanti played Eileen. Reviewing the show in The New York Times, Ben Brantley called the production a ''goose-bump-making revelation.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Daykin said the Broadway version would ideally be staged in the same stripped-down concert style as the City Center production, with minimal sets, lighting and costumes. One area of concern for a commercial run, however, is the size of the production's cast (32 actors) and its orchestra (30 musicians). Both those figures would mean a large weekly overhead.</p>
        <p>Still, a move to Broadway has a precedent in ''Chicago,'' the hit revival that began as an Encores! concert in 1996. That show, produced on Broadway by the Weisslers, turned into a giant international hit, grossing more than $100 million in New York alone and spawning nine other companies around the world.</p>
        <p>An Orphan No More</p>
        <p>Another musical long anticipated in New York has finally found a home. On Nov. 7 ''Jane Eyre,'' John Caird's adaptation of the epic Charlotte Bronte novel of a governess and heartache, is to begin previews at the Brooks Atkinson Theater. An opening is planned for Dec. 3.</p>
        <p>The well-traveled musical, with a score by Paul Gordon, was conceived in the early 1990's. It had a 1994 workshop at the Manhattan Theater Club and a production in Wichita, Kan., a year later.</p>
        <p>In December 1996 it opened in Toronto in what was billed as a pre-Broadway tryout. But a combination of mixed reviews and lack of available theater delayed the move south.</p>
        <p>Then last summer the show re-emerged, selling out a two-month run at the La Jolla Playhouse near San Diego, breaking box-office records and receiving its best reviews to date. Still, no theater was available.</p>
        <p>Now the show finally is expected to arrive, with Marla Schaffel playing Jane and Mary Stout the comic Mrs. Fairfax, as they have since its early days. James Barbour is Rochester, Jane's love interest.</p>
        <p>Annette Niemtzow, who leads a four-member producing team, said the long wait had been worthwhile. ''Given the situation where everybody is so hungry for theaters,'' she said, ''we're just thrilled to be getting our chance.''</p>
        <p>Clipping 'Wings'</p>
        <p>''Waiting in the Wings,'' Noel Coward's 1960 play, is giving up the ghost. The production, which its producers say recouped its investment, will close on May 28.</p>
        <p>The closing comes as a small surprise because one of its stars, Lauren Bacall, had recently announced a contract extension, while its other star, Rosemary Harris, has just been nominated for a Tony Award.</p>
        <p>But Leonard Soloway, a producer of the play, said that sales for June ''looked disastrous.''</p>
        <p>Taking Charge</p>
        <p>Considering that ''Lydie Breeze,'' at New York Theater Workshop, is about a group of friends involved in the establishment of a utopian community, it seems fitting that the production itself resulted from a ''let's put on a show'' mentality.</p>
        <p>The main cheerleader for the production was Elizabeth Marvel, who plays the title character, the conflicted idealist at the two-part cycle's heart. In January she arranged a casual reading of the John Guare script by calling a group of friends. ''I said, 'We're not going to rehearse it, just read,' '' she said.</p>
        <p>That reading was so successful that when another spring production at the workshop was delayed, Ms. Marvel and her actors jumped in. She invited Adam Guettel, a friend, to compose some songs and asked her boyfriend, Bill Camp, to play a leading role.</p>
        <p>The production has received favorable reviews since opening on Monday, the same day Ms. Marvel won an Obie Award for her work in ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' an earlier production at the workshop.</p>
        <p>''You always hear about the disempowered actor, their fate in other people's hands,'' Ms. Marvel said. ''It's just really wonderful to experience it the other way around.''</p>
        <p>Return Engagement</p>
        <p>Blythe Danner will celebrate her 20th year acting at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts this summer, appearing opposite Stephen Collins in ''Tonight at 8:30,'' a collection of six one-acts by Noel Coward. Ms. Danner and Mr. Collins are to perform in three of the plays, while Charlotte D'Ambroise and Bill Irwin will appear in the other trio.</p>
        <p>Other casting for the summer season includes Sara Gilbert (late of the television show ''Roseanne'') in ''Hot L Baltimore,'' Marian Seldes in ''The Skin of Our Teeth'' and Eric Stoltz in ''Light Up the Sky.''</p>
