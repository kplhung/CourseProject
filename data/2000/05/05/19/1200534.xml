        <p>Enslaved Africans traveled to the New World with little more than their chains. In their hearts, however, they bore a rich cultural history.</p>
        <p>Visitors can witness it this weekend at Philipsburg Manor, a restored 18th-century estate in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y., that will hold its annual re-creation of the Pinkster Festival.</p>
        <p>A colonial celebration that grew to be as much African as it was Dutch, ''Pinkster included this big parade or carnival,'' said Larry Earl, an associate director of Historic Hudson Valley, the organization that oversees Philipsburg and other historic sites. ''It was almost like the carnivals of medieval times, when people at the bottom could be at the top.''</p>
        <p>The festival's name is believed to refer to the Pentecost and to the pink azaleas that bloomed at the time. Because work was suspended, slaves had a rare opportunity to expose their children to the world they had left behind. Philipsburg will show how they did it with storytelling, cooking demonstrations, music and dance, all of it interactive.</p>
        <p>Judith Samuel and the Children of Dahomey Dancers, for example, will do ''The Contra Dance.'' ''It's actually a dance where the blacks made fun of the white dances, the stiff minuets,'' Mr. Earl said. ''It has hip movement and jumping, but it was developed to put on their masters.''</p>
        <p>For the first time, the Pinkster Festival will also have a somber side: ''The Fire This Time: Cuffee's Trial,'' a play by Michael Lord that is to be performed tomorrow night. It is based on the 1741 trial of Cuffee, a doomed slave at Philipsburg who was convicted, on scant evidence, of a conspiracy to murder whites.</p>
        <p>Mr. Earl portrays Cuffee; the members of the audience play the jury, who are asked to decide Cuffee's fate, first as contemporary citizens and then as colonial males.</p>
        <p>''It's a great way to see how the justice system was very different 200 years ago,'' Mr. Earl said.</p>
        <p>Pinkster Festival, tomorrow and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. at Philipsburg Manor, Route 9, two miles north of the Tappan Zee Bridge, Sleepy Hollow, N.Y., (914) 631-3992. Admission: $8; the elderly, $7; children, $4. Tickets are the same prices for ''The Fire This Time: Cuffee's Trial,'' tomorrow at 7 p.m. at the Old Dutch Church, Route 9, Reservations: (914) 631-8200, Extension 628.</p>
        <p>Beat Generations</p>
        <p>Tomorrow, the eerie sounds of a U.F.O. and the mystical beating of voodoo drums will reverberate through Avery Fisher Hall.</p>
        <p>A horror convention? No, just a percussion concert by the New York Philharmonic.</p>
        <p>''When we saw the program, we knew it had to be a Young People's Concert,'' said Thomas Cabaniss, the Philharmonic's director of education. ''It had the U.F.O., and the mystery of aliens, and it's so much fun.''</p>
        <p>The music was selected to highlight the talents of Evelyn Glennie, who will be the orchestra's guest soloist. Ms. Glennie is an unusual musician, and not just because she dresses like an intergalactic invader to play Michael Daughtery's ''U.F.O. for Solo Percussion and Orchestra.'' She has been deaf most of her life.</p>
        <p>''She is known for coming out on stage barefoot, so she can feel the vibrations of the orchestra she's playing with,'' Mr. Cabaniss said.</p>
        <p>Before the hourlong concert, which will also include works by Askell Masson, Roberto Sierra and Christopher Rouse, the Philharmonic will stage its Children's Promenade, which Mr. Cabaniss described as ''a hands-on interactive music fair.''</p>
        <p>It will fill the hall lobby with stations like Tympany World and Bongo World, where children can meet musicians and try their instruments, and a make-your-own-drum table. Youngsters will also receive ''goodie bags'' that include stickers in the shape of musical notes, which they can place on staves along the walls.</p>
        <p>''If kids want to use them to make up a piece, the musicians will play it,'' Mr. Cabaniss said. ''There's a lot of impromptu composing.''</p>
        <p>Young People's Concert, tomorrow at Avery Fisher Hall. Promenade at 12:45 p.m.; concert at 2 p.m. Tickets: $6 to $21. Information, (212) 875-5709; CenterCharge, (212) 721-6500.</p>
        <p>Rural Rarities</p>
        <p>It has four legs, cloven feet and a thick black hide. It's an endangered species. But if you are envisioning a rare African antelope, think again. The animal is an Old English Large Black Pig, and it will be on display Sunday in Stamford, Conn., with other vanishing farm breeds, like Durham cattle and Exmoor ponies.</p>
        <p>''You hear of endangered species of wildlife, but not domestic species,'' said Mary Novotny, the farm director at the Stamford Museum and Nature Center. ''But it's a problem with longterm consequences.''</p>
        <p>The animals will be part of the educational component of the center's annual ''Spring on the Farm.'' The festival will also include familiar creatures like sheep and ducks, which will be expertly herded by guest border collies. Children can also meet the farm's own border collie, Molly, ''a goose patrol dog,'' Ms. Novotny said.</p>
        <p>The fair will offer demonstrations from sheep shearing to plowing and activities for children like carding wool and drop spindling. And at noon and 1 p.m., the puppeteer and singer Chris Rowlands will present ''Farmin' Fever,'' something no parents will mind their children catching.</p>
        <p>''Spring on the Farm,'' Sunday from 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Stamford Museum and Nature Center, 39 Scofieldtown Road, at High Ridge Road, (203) 322-1646. Admission: $5 (Stamford residents, $3); the elderly and ages 5 to 13, $4 (Stamford residents, $2); children under 5, free.</p>
