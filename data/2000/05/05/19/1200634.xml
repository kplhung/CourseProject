        <p>Four college students from the East Side of Manhattan assaulted a 24-year-old man in the East Village yesterday after shouting anti-gay slurs at him, the police said.</p>
        <p>Dana Cuffaro, 21, of East 52nd Street and her brother, Michael, of East 54th Street, were arrested in the attack along with Ian Blackstone, 18, of East 85th Street and Sean Lackaye, 18, of East 68th Street. All four were charged with assault and robbery, and the case was referred to the Police Department's hate crimes task force.</p>
        <p>The police said the man was walking down East 10th Street when he encountered the four suspects, who shouted anti-gay slurs and then chased him when he tried to run away. The police said Dana Cuffaro confronted him, and that when he put out his arms to keep her away, three men chased the victim, took his bag, knocked him down, and punched and kicked him. He suffered minor injuries and was treated at Bellevue Hospital Center and released, the police said.</p>
        <p>Leonard Levenson, a lawyer for the suspects, said the police report did not contain the full story. He said that the four had met the man in an East Village bar and had gotten into an argument during which the man had struck Ms. Cuffaro in the face. That angered her brother and led to the scuffle outside, he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levenson described the suspects as honor students who had never been in trouble with the law before.</p>
