        <p>Sierra Leone's minister of justice sat in his office today and spoke of the need for reconciliation -- even with the warlord Foday Sankoh.</p>
        <p>A day after Mr. Sankoh's surprise capture sparked popular calls for his prosecution or execution, the justice minister, Solomon Berewa, who led the government's negotiations for a peace accord that has all but collapsed, said:</p>
        <p>''The people are angry, they are annoyed, they have been suffering for long. But the role of the government should be to get people to realize that vengeance would not bring peace. What we need more than anything else is reconciliation. That cannot be watered down at all.''</p>
        <p>When Mr. Berewa was asked specifically whether reconciliation applied to Mr. Sankoh, whose men have killed 19 unarmed civilians, taken 500 United Nations peacekeepers hostage and thrust this country back into civil war, all since the beginning of this month, he said, ''To everybody.''</p>
        <p>The beleaguered government of Sierra Leone has not said what it plans to do with Mr. Sankoh, who remained in government custody today, or what kind of role, if any, he will have in the country's future. The peace accord signed in July 1999 had granted him amnesty for his actions before then, and had promised him a role in a power-sharing government.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Berewa's comments today underlined the weakness of a government that is at the mercy of outside forces -- despite statements by the United Nations and Washington that it is up to the government to make decisions regarding Mr. Sankoh and the existing peace accord.</p>
        <p>In many ways, the government finds itself in a situation similar to one it was in last year when it reluctantly signed the peace accord with Mr. Sankoh's group, the Revolutionary United Front. At that time, the government had no real army of its own. Nigeria, which was leading a West African peacekeeping force in support of the government, said it was pulling out its troops. Western nations, led by the United States, pressed the government to make a deal with Mr. Sankoh, considered by many to be a war criminal.</p>
        <p>Today, the government still lacks a real army, and its protection depends on two warlords with their own interests, as well as the United Nations and British troops. How the government treats Mr. Sankoh, how strongly or weakly it can move forward from the 1999 accord, will depend greatly on foreign commitment.</p>
        <p>The government has said Mr. Sankoh was planning a coup and preparing to traffic in diamonds, and it holds him responsible for the 19 deaths outside his house, but it has not said whether he will be charged with those crimes.</p>
        <p>The government ''has to consult with a lot of subregional partners who have been working very hard to bring peace to Sierra Leone,'' Mr. Berewa said. ''The government cannot unilaterally decide to change any term of the agreement without due consultation, though the population would like it to do otherwise.''</p>
        <p>The people of Freetown, deceived so many times by Mr. Sankoh and terrorized by a campaign of amputation by the rebel group, seem opposed to any reconciliation.</p>
        <p>''The U.N. should be given a different, stronger mandate,'' said Elizabeth Alpha-Lavalie, an outspoken member of the national legislature. ''They should be able to enforce peace. We have not been treated fairly by the international community.''</p>
        <p>What seems certain is that outside nations' commitment to Sierra Leone will have to increase once the dust settles here, even if all parties agree to restart the peace effort. If the remaining 270 United Nations hostages are released and fighting between pro-government forces and the rebels stops, the estimated 45,000 combatants will have to be disarmed again. About half had disarmed before the recent rebel uprising.</p>
        <p>''I don't believe we can have a voluntary disarmament next time,'' said a United Nations military observer who was involved in the disarmament process. ''It will have to be enforced.''</p>
        <p>In recent days, the city's newspapers and talk radio have been filled with comments expressing anger at any sign of accommodation toward Mr. Sankoh. And in a turn that seemed to allow the public to vent its frustration, anger was directed at the Rev. Jesse Jackson, President Clinton's special envoy for Africa, who began a peace tour of West Africa today with a stop in Nigeria.</p>
        <p>Last Friday, Mr. Jackson said Mr. Sankoh should be coaxed back into politics and could play a positive role in the hostage crisis. The comment was not too different from what the government has been saying. But perhaps Sierra Leone, the world's poorest country, did not want to hear it from the world's richest.</p>
        <p>''I cannot help believing that the Rev. Jackson is a collaborator of Foday Sankoh -- that he has a hidden agenda,'' said Abu Mbawa Kongonba, an American-educated member of the national legislature.</p>
        <p>And so, because of the hostility directed at Mr. Jackson, his mission to bring peace to Sierra Leone will probably not include a stop in Sierra Leone.</p>
        <p>But along with the emotion focused on Mr. Jackson, there lurks a simmering anger against the United States. It is the country that endorsed the peace accord, and its secretary of state, Madeleine K. Albright, made a point of visiting Freetown -- touring its amputee camp and meeting Mr. Sankoh last October -- in a well-orchestrated show of support for this forgotten country.</p>
        <p>To many Sierra Leoneans, Britain's involvement in the crisis has made America's absence even more conspicuous. ''The American diplomatic support has been very strong,'' said Mr. Berewa, the justice minister. ''But that is not enough.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Berewa, whose government was chosen in 1996 in an election considered free and fair, added: ''The Americans are good at criticizing countries that do not practice democracy, but this country had set itself on a course toward democracy. So we believe that we are a good candidate for American assistance.</p>
        <p>''All we are saying is we do not expect U.S. marines to fight and die here. Perhaps that's too much to expect from America. But they could come and help us with so many things -- technical advice, equipment, transportation. The obligation is moral.''</p>
