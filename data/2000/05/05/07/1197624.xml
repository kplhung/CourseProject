        <p>The May Department Store Company's promotion of Jane T. Elfers, 39, to president and chief executive of the Lord &amp; Taylor division last week was the latest move in a more extensive executive shuffle. While it is unlikely that Ms. Elfers, who has been with the company since 1989, will make any radical changes, her promotion is one more piece of evidence that Gene Kahn, who became president and chief executive of May last year, is looking to shape a  potentially more aggressive executive suite.</p>
        <p>Since the beginning of the year, Mr. Kahn has been busy mixing and matching top management; the company had announced nine major promotions before Ms. Elfers's. Others include  moving Judith K. Hofer from chief executive of Filene's, another May division, to president and chief executive of May Merchandising, which buys for all May stores, and promoting two May veterans, Richard W. Bennet III and William P. McNamara, to vice chairmen of the corporation.</p>
