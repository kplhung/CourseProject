        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A wise government always listens to the warnings of the opposition, but there is no real reason for Miklos Haraszti (Op-Ed, May 2) to worry about the Hungarian government's cooperating with extremists in Hungary. My government expressed its concerns about some statements by Jorg Haider, the leader of Austria's Freedom Party, but the majority of Hungarians agree that the best way to deal with unwelcome tendencies in Austria is to watch and engage rather than to ostracize.</p>
        <p>Contrary to Mr. Haraszti's terminology, there are no ''far right'' parties in Hungary. As Prime Minister Viktor Orban pointed out recently, there are radical parties both on the right and the left, totaling less than 10 percent of public support, with a marginal presence in the legislature.</p>
