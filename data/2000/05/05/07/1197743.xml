        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>I just don't understand the penalties of the baseball commissioner. Players make millions of dollars a year, so what can an eight-game or even a 15-game suspension mean? It means that some guy that year will make $7.1 million rather than $7.6 million. Some punishment.</p>
        <p>If baseball is serious about avoiding such vicious fights as happened between the Detroit Tigers and the Chicago White Sox, what it needs to do is suspend without pay for a whole season those who start the fight and half a season or 40 games, whichever is more, for those who join in. That will hurt in the only way that will control their behavior.</p>

        <p>If any player knows that if he throws the first punch, he is out for the season (or more), he will control himself. There is a difference between $7.1 million and $0. Even a baseball player can compare those figures.</p>
