        <p>The leadership advice that Cardinal Terence Cooke often gave to the voluble bishop who would succeed him in 1984 as archbishop of New York was this:</p>
        <p>''You don't have to swing at every pitch.''</p>
        <p>During most of the 16 years that Cardinal John O'Connor reigned as the most combative and charismatic voice of Roman Catholicism in the United States, he exuberantly ignored his predecessor's counsel.</p>
        <p>''Well, I think I have swung at almost every pitch,'' the prelate recalled in a 1994 appearance on the Charlie Rose show.</p>
        <p>Cardinal O'Connor rarely stepped back from the plate on matters of abortion, contraception, gay rights and the ordination of women -- emotionally explosive issues that have divided American Catholics. He was almost always game for a doctrinally emphatic comment, often with a pithy quote that appeared in the tabloids and the evening news.</p>
        <p>His death last week is a reminder of the degree to which a confrontational style helped make him the best-known and perhaps the most influential voice in the American Catholic Church. But it also underlines the difficulties facing whoever tries to put on his leadership mantle.</p>
        <p>Cardinal O'Connor's outsized personality and his in-your-face skills with the New York media camouflaged what Catholic historians and church observers agree is a significant diminution in the influence of bishops in the daily lives of American Catholics.</p>
        <p>''The church is very distant from the lives of people on a daily basis,'' said Frank Macchiarola, president of St. Francis College in Brooklyn and a former schools chancellor in New York. ''The challenge for the bishops is not that the people won't follow the rules, but that they will not think the rules are significant.''</p>
        <p>Several church historians said Cardinal O'Connor was perhaps the last cardinal archbishop in American history who could take for granted the prominence of the Catholic Church in the public eye, as a leading institution, a shaper of public opinion and an overwhelming influence on the culture.</p>
        <p>''The key here is that O'Connor could take it for granted,'' said R. Scott Appleby, director of the Cushwa Center for the Study of American Catholicism at the University of Notre Dame. ''His great accomplishment was to extend the life of that influential presence by his personal style.''</p>
        <p>Cardinal O'Connor's successor as the ad hoc leader of American Catholics, whether he comes from the archdiocese of New York, Los Angeles, Chicago or another major American city, will not be so lucky.</p>
        <p>The priesthood in America is in decline, as is the community of religious women working in Catholic schools and hospitals. The Archdiocese of New York, in large measure because of Cardinal O'Connor's energy, is an exception to the dismal trend of institutional downsizing in schools and parishes in major cities like Detroit, Philadelphia, Chicago and San Francisco. Polls have shown for years that many Catholics do not accept church teachings on contraception, homosexuality and the ordination of women. Finally, there is a deep demographic divide within the American church, with new immigrants from Latin America and Asia on one side and assimilated middle-class Catholic culture on the other.</p>
        <p>''The idea that you have authority because you occupy an office is not very functional in the history of the American church,'' said David O'Brien, the Loyola professor of Roman Catholic studies at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Mass. ''You have to wonder how long authority can be maintained without a real strong pastoral basis.''</p>
        <p>Echoing the views of several scholars who study the church, Dr. O'Brien said the pastoral connection of bishops to believers was at risk of being severed by demographic trends and by the insistence of Pope John Paul II on strict doctrinal discipline.</p>
        <p>''I don't quite know where this is going to go,'' Dr. O'Brien said. ''There has been such a strong emphasis on the teachings of the pope. It is a very papal church now. There isn't much consultation with the clergy or the laity. It looks like the pope feels he can appoint anyone he wants.''</p>
        <p>While there is widespread agreement among Catholic intellectuals about the eroding influence of bishops in the lives of American Catholics, there is considerable disagreement about how to fix it.</p>
        <p>Conservatives argue that Catholics are thirsting for a strong, doctrinally clear leader in the mold of Cardinal O'Connor, a man with a forceful personality who can cut a high profile as a preacher, teacher and figure in the media.</p>
        <p>''Because of his highly visible defense of Catholic teachings on life, Cardinal O'Connor made it possible for a lot of Catholics who wanted to believe in that teaching to get behind him,'' said Deal Hudson, publisher and editor of Crisis magazine, a conservative Catholic monthly published in Washington.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hudson argued that papal orthodoxy on issues like abortion and gay rights did not alienate Catholics.</p>
        <p>''If a bishop communicates in a pastorally sensitive way, it will have an impact, and people's minds and hearts will come around,'' Mr. Hudson said.</p>
        <p>Liberals in the church disagree, arguing that no archbishop in the United States is likely to attain real national influence unless he can somehow close the gap between papal doctrine and the spiritual demands of the laity.</p>
        <p>''Catholics can't help but see that institutionally the church is still very clergy-oriented,'' said Paul Baumann, executive editor of Commonweal, a liberal Catholic magazine published in New York. ''It is impossible for bishops to get the kind of loyalty they had unless there is some sign of change on contraception, mandatory celibacy for priests and the role of women in the church.''</p>
        <p>The kind of archbishop most likely to win a national following, several Catholic historians said, is one who plays down divisive issues like abortion and eloquently articulates a Catholic position on larger social questions. What are the spiritual costs of pursuing material wealth? What is the role of the state toward the vulnerable and dispossessed? How do Americans square their rising affluence with poverty elsewhere in the world?</p>
        <p>''The fundamental question that the leader of Catholics in America has to address is why do Americans need a permanent community of faith to fulfill their spiritual lives,'' said Professor Appleby at Notre Dame. ''The answer cannot just be a sound bite that says no to abortion or premarital sex. It has to be a whole story that puts the noes in context and in which Americans recognize their own lives.''</p>
        <p>Given the weaknesses of the Catholic church in the United States, Dr. O'Brien said, ''authority is a real tough thing to maintain'' for any archbishop in the country.</p>
        <p>''It has to come from personal charisma or from pastoral care,'' he said. ''Much of Cardinal O'Connor's authority came from charisma. But there are not a lot of charismatic successors out there. They are not in large supply in the American clergy.''</p>
        <p>The alternative, then, is pastoral care, which church intellectuals define as listening to the deepest yearnings of believers and challenging them with the teachings of the Gospel.</p>
        <p>''Our time calls for dialogue, not confrontation,'' said the Rev. Thomas Reese, a Jesuit who is editor in chief of America, the Catholic magazine. ''That is what people are used to.''</p>
