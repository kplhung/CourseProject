        <p>Best Bet</p>
        <p>Whether you like tulips or sheep, there's a fair today as Hofstra University stages its 17th annual Dutch Festival from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. with 100,000 bulbs decorating the Hempstead campus, authentic ethnic food, entertainment, children's activities and a crafts sale (516) 463-6582, and the Huntington Historical Society holds its 16th annual Sheep to Shawl Festival, complete with sheep and shearings, crafts demonstrations, art projects and music and games from noon to 4 p.m. at Kissam House Museum on Park Avenue in Huntington (631) 427-7045.</p>
        <p>Opera, Operas</p>
        <p>The rejuvenated Long Island Opera takes a step today that few opera companies -- let alone small regional troupes -- attempt. The company will present the world premiere of a new work, ''The Sun Also Rises,'' a one-act opera by W. A. Young, the company's director. Based on the novel by Hemingway, whose estate gave Mr. Young permission to adapt it, the piece, conducted by Richard Aulden Clark, features Lawrence Harris, tenor, as Jake, the American reporter in Paris, and Luciana LaMonico, soprano, as Lady Brett Ashley. The second half of the program, at 3 p.m. at the Hays Theater on the Rockville Centre campus of Molloy College, will feature music from Mascagni's rarely performed ''Zanetto'' (516) 616-3556.</p>
        <p>Those who prefer their opera tried and true need not fret. Today, at 2:30 p.m., Opera Pro Voce offers ''Rigoletto'' at the Baldwin Library on Grand Avenue (516) 223-6228, while on Saturday Ridotto, ''Concerts With a Touch of Theater,'' offers ''Rossini Rendezvous,'' a program of arias performed by the Ridotto Chamber Orchestra; Ron Meixsell, bass-baritone; Kim Graham, soprano; and Sahoko Sato, mezzo-soprano. It will be presented at 8 p.m. and then repeated at 4 p.m. next Sunday at the Old First Church on Route 25A in Huntington (631) 385-0373.</p>
        <p>Those Three B's</p>
        <p>Who could resist a concert simply called ''Billy, Bach and Beethoven?''  So get over to Hofstra University in Hempstead on Tuesday when the International Series ends its season with those three B's in a program subtitled, ''A Billy Joel Birthday Concert.'' That is, Derek Wieland, the pianist, will play works by Mr. Joel, Bach and Beethoven at 8 p.m. at the Monroe Lecture Center Theater (516) 463-6644.</p>
        <p>Orchestral Music</p>
        <p>With three ensembles on the boards, this is a good week for devotees of orchestral music.

Post campus of Long Island University in Brookville (516) 299-3100.</p>
        <p>Senior Games</p>
        <p>Whether they compete in golf, bridge or racquetball, enjoy the challenge of an obstacle course or table tennis or just want to learn the newest dance steps, people over the age of 50 from the metropolitan area will join in the ''Long Island Senior Games 2000'' Thursday though next Sunday. This year, with such events as a 5K road race, cycling, lawn bowling, shuffleboard, horseshoes and duplicate bridge added, the games, for beginners as well as accomplished practitioners, will take place at Eisenhower Park in East Meadow, Bethpage State Park in Farmingdale, Nassau Community College and the Garden City Bowl in Garden City and Mitchel Field in Uniondale.

        <p>Baroque to Jazz</p>

        <p>Folk Music Lives</p>
        <p>In the 1960's Club 47, the coffeehouse in Cambridge, Mass., was well-known in the world of folk music, welcoming established acts and up-and-coming artists.

The reincarnation comes to the Patchogue Theater on Main Street at 8 p.m. Friday (631) 286-1133.</p>
