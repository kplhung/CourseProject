        <p>SPEND, spend and then spend some more. Americans have always liked to shop. But over the last couple of years, consumers in this country have been buying at an unprecedented rate.</p>
        <p>With all that stuff flying off the shelves, you would think that retailing stocks would be in great shape. From the start of 1998 until the end of 1999, that assessment would have been correct: the S. &amp; P. retail stores index nearly doubled.</p>
        <p>But since then the group has been a bust.  The index is down 15 percent this year.</p>
        <p>A good chunk of that decline began on Wednesday, when a team of analysts at Goldman Sachs cut its ratings on many retailing stocks. George Strachan, a Goldman vice president, was in the group that issued the report. He took time last week to talk about why he has turned cautious. Following are excerpts from the conversation:</p>
        <p>Q.  Since so many stocks were involved in this downgrade, your shift in opinion seems  based on macro environment factors. Is that the case?</p>
        <p>A.  Yes, this is a macro call. It is not based on what the companies are doing today, and the fundamentals still look pretty good.</p>
        <p>We look at a number of leading indicators that power spending growth. One is real wage growth, which peaked in April 1998 at 3.4 percent, and has now decelerated to 1.3 percent.</p>
        <p>The second is housing turnover, which also peaked in the spring of 1998 at a growth rate of 16.1 percent. Currently it is declining at a 7.6 percent annual rate. That means fewer and fewer new and existing homes are being sold, even though the level of activity is still very high.</p>
        <p>The third factor we look at is installment credit, which is growing at the same rate it did a year ago.</p>
        <p>With personal consumption spending growing at somewhere between 5 percent and 6 percent and all these indicators heading south, we felt we would probably see a deceleration in retail sales growth in the second half of the year. That's why we cut our ratings.  Q.  Could you give some insight into the anatomy of your decision?</p>
        <p>A.  Well, there were six people involved in this call. We have been watching these indicators for a year and a half.</p>
        <p>I may have let the decision to downgrade these stocks slide a little bit because of the market, and because from an absolute perspective real wage growth at 2 percent was not so bad. But it is lower now, and we decided it was now more appropriate to be cautious.</p>
        <p>Q.  The Federal Reserve has been raising short-term rates, and is likely to raise them some more. Was that a factor?  A.  We don't see much, if any, correlation between change in the federal funds rate and changes in real personal consumption expenditure. If I am on my way to Wal-Mart and I hear the Fed has raised the funds rate, the information doesn't change my behavior a bit. We are six months into a rising rate environment and spending hasn't slowed a whit.  Q.  How much of a slowdown do you see?</p>
        <p>A.  We think we will see a deceleration in the growth of personal consumption expenditures from about 5.7 percent currently to around 4 percent. Now, 4 percent is a pretty decent level of growth. In an expansion you normally see personal consumption growth average about 3 percent. So that deceleration may not be enough to satisfy the Fed.</p>
        <p>Q.  And yet since the start of the year the stocks have been weak. Are retailing stocks projecting a slowdown in the economy?</p>
        <p>A.  I wouldn't say retailing stocks have been leading indicators of economic slowdowns.</p>
        <p>We had an early cyclical move in the stocks in early 1991, and then they underperformed for a couple of years. What has made retailing interesting in this cycle has been the rise in personal consumption alongside the problems in Asia, which slowed exports and industrial production. That generated a late cycle rally. Everyone wanted to own Wal-Mart, for example, because it had little Asian exposure. The growth names had a marvelous late cycle move, which is uncharacteristic.</p>
        <p>Q.  What other retailers are growth stocks?</p>
        <p>A.  In addition to Wal-Mart, Costco, Target Stores and Kohl's are the pure growth stocks in my sector. Tiffany is another growth stock, but I don't cover it.</p>
        <p>A lot of these stocks have outperformed the market by as much as 80 percent over the last two years. And I think these five stocks will continue to provide market leadership. They still have tremendous growth opportunities in front of them.</p>
        <p>Q.  Which are you less enthusiastic about?</p>
        <p>A.  We cut our ratings on Federated Department Stores, May Department Stores, Neiman-Marcus, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch, TJX and Ross Stores to market performer from market outperformer.</p>
