        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I enjoyed your item on Bernstein-on-Essex (''Egg Rolls Fit for a Rabbi,'' F.Y.I., April 16).</p>
        <p>The Bernsteins were family friends when I was growing up.  Schmulka Bernstein was Sol Bernstein's father, and he owned a butcher shop on Ludlow Street that he and his four sons ran. Sol peeled off to start the deli but I have no doubt that he got the meat from his father that he used to prepare his own corned beef and pastrami.</p>

        <p>I still miss them when I go to the Lower East Side, although I never thought much of the Chinese menu.</p>
