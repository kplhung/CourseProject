        <p>As eastbound traffic on the Long Island Expressway reaches 69th Street in the Juniper Park section of Maspeth, the below-grade roadway  rises until it runs parallel with the houses beside it. With the incline comes the rising whine of autos.</p>
        <p>Anthony Nunziato, a resident, said the noise was so loud in some parts of the community that people could no longer chat from yard to yard. ''If they're more than 10 feet away,'' he said, ''they can't hear each other.''</p>
        <p>Robert F. Holden, president of the Juniper Park Civic Association, added: ''The sound of the cars is unbearable. Many people have moved out or are threatening to move out. You've got trucks revving their diesel engines and cars speeding up. And you've got this hum, this drone, from the concrete roadbed they installed three years ago.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Holden was referring to a 1997 project in which the State Department of Transportation replaced the asphalt surface of the roadbed with what Alex Dudley, an agency spokesman, described as ''a coarser, more resistant concrete that gives better traction and more durability.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Dudley said the concrete's finish causes a high-pitched whine when car and truck tires roll over it. As a result, traffic noise in the area has increased to 70 or more decibels, what a vacuum cleaner sounds like from 10 feet away. He said the department was grinding down the finish on a half-mile length of expressway between Hamilton Place and 71st Street to reduce the noise by five to nine decibels.</p>
        <p>Another effort to control the noise is under way. According to Margaret M. Markey, the local assemblywoman, concrete sound barriers will be installed on the eastbound side of the expressway between 69th and 75th Streets to match those on the westbound side. The new barriers, which will be up to 16 feet high, will be installed during the next few months.</p>
        <p>Not everyone wants the barriers. Residents on the eastbound side of the expressway between Maurice Avenue and Hamilton Place have asked the Transportation Department to use plantings to dampen the noise. Last fall the department planted trees between the expressway and a service road at the edge of the neighborhood, but some have withered.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dudley said the department intended to plant 200 more trees on the site next fall, not only to control noise but also to make the trip more scenic.</p>
