        <p>Every day, importers and brokers crisscross France's back roads in search of unknown or undervalued wines, winnowing rigorously as they sample hundreds of bottles. It takes palates like Melissa D. S'er'e's, schooled by 18 years in the trade, to find the right stuff.</p>
        <p>She is making her importing debut with promising reds, among them the ingratiating 1997 Chateau de Clapier Cuv'ee Reserv'ee, from the Cotes du Luberon in the southern Rhone, and the spicy 1998 Chateau Bastian, from southern Bordeaux.</p>
        <p>Mrs. S'er'e first attracted attention in New York in 1982 as a founder of the Academie du Vin, a wine school, which in 1986 became Connaissance; she founded the Swiss Wine Information Council and was its director from 1990 to 1997.</p>
        <p>The fresh fruit flavor of Chateau de Clapier, a syrah-grenache-pinot noir blend, resembles a liquified raspberry-and-strawberry jam. It is a drink that vignerons, who shrug off sexism, call a feminine wine. By that index, Chateau Bastian is masculine: sturdy, solid and a valet for meat and potatoes.</p>
        <p>Clapier costs $11 at the New York Wine Exchange, 9 Beaver Street (Broadway); $10 at K &amp; D, 1366 Madison Avenue (96th Street); and $11 at Nancy's, 313 Columbus Avenue (75th Street). Bastian is $10 at Nancy's and $10 at Beekman, 500 Lexington Avenue (47th Street).</p>
        <p>Melissa S'er'e Selections are distributed by Andrew M. Gold of A. G. Wines, 352 Seventh Avenue in Manhattan (212-631-7462).</p>
