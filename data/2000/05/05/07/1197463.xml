        <p>IT is a glorious spring morning, the daffodils standing at attention outside Bernice Woodbury's white Colonial on one of Scarsdale's prettiest streets. Inside are nine women, babies and toddlers in tow, eating bagels and swapping shopping tips and vacation ideas. But in one important way this is not a typical Westchester play group: the happy chatter has the long, flat accent of Australia, with a sprinkle of New Zealand and Scotland.</p>
        <p>''This is a chance to get out and have a talk and a cup of tea,'' said Carolyn Broughan, an Australian mother of three who lives with her husband, Patrick, in nearby Edgemont. ''You leave all your family and friends at home, and it can get lonely.''</p>
        <p>They call themselves expatriates -- well-to-do Germans, Japanese, Australians, French and other foreign nationals who have found their way to Westchester after being transferred by their companies to New York City.</p>
        <p>For Americans familiar with Ernest Hemingway, the term ''expatriate'' conjures up images of youthful decadence. But the county's expatriate community has nothing in common with the dissolute and aimless characters in ''The Sun Also Rises.''</p>
        <p>In many ways, the expatriates of Westchester, who live side by side with Americans 2in some of the county's most desirable towns and villages, have blended so seamlessly into suburban life -- with mothers shuttling children from play dates to practices -- that it is easy to miss them.</p>
        <p>But their numbers have been growing, along with the global economy. And as foreign families struggle to adapt to a new culture for an average of three to five years while preserving a bit of their own, they are adding a multinational effervescence to the county, with certain towns acting as magnets for particular nationalities.</p>
        <p>Snapping in the wind high above German School New York in White Plains are the American, Austrian, German and Swiss flags. The new Auray Cheese Shop in Larchmont, where the French-American School of New York is situated, offers 80 French cheeses along with crusty baguettes, truffle oil and French chocolates. (''We realized there was a huge French community here, and nobody was doing cheese,'' said Dale Saffir, who owns the shop with her husband, Warren Reid.) Japanese produce and packaged foods fill the aisles of Meidi-Ya, a Japanese market in Hartsdale, while the Japanese-owned Parisienne bakery next door sells traditional buns filled with sweet red-bean paste.</p>
        <p>''Everything has gotten very international,'' said Ruth Chizzini, director of relocation for Julia B. Fee, a real estate agency with offices in Rye, Larchmont and Scarsdale. ''We're getting a lot of people from London, Switzerland, France, Germany and Singapore. They're always interested in the schools, and they like to be close to the city if they can.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, lower Westchester, where a number of towns are increasingly identified with one or more nationalities, is beginning to resemble a map of the world. Sometimes, a family wants to be near a foreign school. Other times, a company will steer employees to particular suburbs where they may even own houses, as a couple of Australian banks do in Scarsdale. Then there is the snowball effect, in which couples gravitate toward towns that already have hefty numbers of their compatriots.</p>
        <p>The French have congregated in Larchmont as well as in nearby Mamaroneck and New Rochelle (a city that, coincidentally, was settled by French Huguenots in the late 1600's). The Germans have overwhelmingly chosen White Plains as their temporary hometown, but they can also be found in Rye, Scarsdale and Mamaroneck. Australians, New Zealanders and Brazilians prefer Scarsdale and Rye, in that order. And the Japanese, whose Westchester presence has shrunk in recent years because of the faltering Japanese economy, are still enamored of Scarsdale, although they also look for houses and apartments in Rye, Harrison, Hartsdale and Eastchester.</p>
        <p>Scarsdale, in fact, is famous in Japan, standing for quality schools and housing.</p>
        <p>''It's a brand name, and the Japanese like brand goods and brand names,'' said Kuniko Katz, a Japanese expatriate who raised a family in Scarsdale after marrying an American social studies teacher years ago. Last year, Mrs. Katz, who has tried to bridge the gap between the two cultures, founded Japan America Community Outreach, a nonprofit organization, which helps Japanese expatriates become acclimated to American society while introducing Westchester residents to Japanese life.</p>
        <p>Wherever they are, expatriates tend to live in impressive homes in costly neighborhoods, the result of generous housing allowances that can hit $8,000 a month and up. (One exception of late are the Japanese who are being sent over in less senior positions, with smaller allowances.) ''You've got to be paid a premium to uproot your family, and expatriates are compensated well enough that they tend to live in nice places,'' said Joseph C. Snyder, president of the American Australian Association, a business and social organization in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Most expatriates prefer to rent rather than buy, since they are here for a relatively short time. The trick, however, is finding a house to rent in an overheated real estate market. ''Everybody wants to sell, and you're the odd one out,'' said Brigitte Marquardt, who heads a newcomer's club for German-speaking expatriates. Although the County Planning Department does not have numbers to document the presence of expatriates, real estate agents and officials of foreign schools report an increase in numbers among several nationalities.</p>
        <p>Some expatriates, like Patrick Croze of Larchmont, who arrived in New York from France on business in 1983, find life in Westchester County so pleasant that they end up staying. ''I was transferred here for three years,'' he said, ''and I'm still here.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Croze, 53, is now the director of finance for the French-American School of New York, a bilingual, bicultural private school with 620 students on two campuses -- in Larchmont and Mamaroneck -- and a waiting list of 120. In 1992, Mr. Croze became an American citizen. Twice a year, he and his family return to France to visit friends and family who often question his decision to become a Yankee.</p>
        <p>''I tell them it's good to have one foot on each side,'' he said. ''I find life here very easy. Everything is ordered and clean and extremely safe. In Europe, there is the idea that people here are always killing each other. But New York is safer than Paris.''</p>
        <p>Of course, it doesn't hurt that French culture in the Larchmont area has evolved to the point that there is a French newcomer's club (with activities almost daily and not only for newcomers), a French theater group, a French bakery and even a doctor who speaks French fluently. In fact, one reason so many French people ''stick around'' Larchmont, Mr. Croze said, is to be near Dr. Philip Heinegg, an American family practitioner who studied medicine in France and is married to a French woman.</p>
        <p>''It's one thing to communicate in a foreign language when you're doing business,'' said Dr. Heinegg, whose practice in Larchmont treats 300 French patients. ''But when there is something wrong with you physically or emotionally you need to talk about it in your mother tongue.''</p>
        <p>For women, the expatriate experience can be especially tough. All are torn from friends and family, and many leave behind careers as well. Once in the United States, only the husbands qualify for work visas. Friendships with Americans can be elusive, and husbands typically work long hours and travel frequently on business.</p>
        <p>The expatriate social organizations are a crucial outlet. Members of the German newcomer's club have visited the Lower East Side Tenement Museum in Manhattan and toured historic mansions in the Hudson Valley. The French Welcome Service, which puts out a newsletter four times a year, organizes crafts projects, bridge games, morning jogs, cooking classes, book discussions and play groups for its members.</p>
        <p>There is some intermingling between nationalities, too. Though largely Australian, the Scarsdale play group, which meets every other week, also includes women from New Zealand, the Netherlands, England, Scotland and Germany.</p>
        <p>But even more valuable than the formal networks, expatriates say, are the loose circles of friends that function like surrogate families. Jacque Yates, an Australian mother of two in Scarsdale, said she recently sent her baby sitter to the home of a neighbor, another Australian, who needed someone to watch her children while she went to the doctor.</p>
        <p>''You bend over backward because everybody's in the same boat,'' Mrs. Yates said. ''We don't have mothers and relatives here, so we help each other out at the drop of a hat.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps nothing provides so strong a reminder of home as food, and expatriates are expert at tracking down authentic providers. Karl Ehmer Quality Meats, with three stores in Westchester, and Atlantic Meat Market in Norwalk are must stops for self-respecting Germans in search of classic German sausage.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Croze, the Frenchman, a stroll down Arthur Avenue in the Bronx, the popular street of Italian food markets, satisfies a certain longing. ''It's like shopping in Europe,'' he said. ''There are all these little shops, and you can speak Italian to the people.''</p>
        <p>At times it can seem as if expatriates have built parallel societies for themselves, between the socializing and the schools (there is a Japanese elementary school in Greenwich and a Japanese high school in Purchase). But many foreign nationals say they relish the chance to experience American culture firsthand. And it is not only the children who want to pass for an American.</p>
        <p>Ian M. Phillips, executive vice president and general manager of the Americas for the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, who lives in Scarsdale, said one of his greatest goals was to be able to use telephone voice-recognition systems successfully, which so far have been tripped up by his New Zealand accent. ''I'm absolutely sure that some day I'll get that down pat,'' he said. ''Another three years.''</p>
        <p>Even the German School in White Plains, which receives funds from the German, Austrian and Swiss governments, takes pride in its American attributes, from its softball program to multi-ethnic food.</p>
        <p>''Our cafeteria is run by a French caterer, the cook is Italian and all the service aides are South American,'' Wolfgang Ditscheid, the principal, said. ''When you go through our school corridors, you hear our kids speak English.''</p>
        <p>Befriending Americans, at least for the adults, is sometimes difficult, however. Many Americans in Westchester, expatriates say, are too busy for their existing friends to take on new friends who will eventually leave. A language barrier can make relations harder still.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Katz, the cultural go-between for the Japanese, is adamant that Japanese women reach out to American women. The sharing of Japanese rituals, in her mind, is a perfect opening.</p>
        <p>In March, she organized a Japanese Festival at the Eastchester Library, with 15 Japanese women demonstrating the art of the tea ceremony, calligraphy, flower arranging and origami for 60 American women and children. In May, Mrs. Katz's organization, Japan America Community Outreach, plans a series of similar demonstrations at the Scarsdale Historical Society.</p>
        <p>In the early 1990's, tensions flared in Scarsdale after a sharp influx of Japanese families there; one magazine article spoke ominously of ''The Japanning of Scarsdale.''</p>
        <p>''They were coming one after another in the school system, and it was very hard for the teachers and the community members,'' Mrs. Katz said. ''All of a sudden there were Japanese everywhere. But then people got used to it, and the Japanese also started to leave one by one.''</p>
        <p>As she loaded daikon, bamboo shoots and green tea into her cart at Meidi-Ya, Tsuru N. Hiroshima, a Japanese expatriate who lives with her husband, Koji, in Hartsdale, agreed that newcomers needed to make the first move. Recently, she showed some fellow members of the Scarsdale Golf Club different ways to prepare tofu. ''You have to sell yourself if you are in a foreign country,'' Mrs. Hiroshima said. ''You can't wait for people to come to you.''</p>
        <p>Regardless of nationality, most expatriates appear to like American life more than they dislike it. Yes, there are mild irritations along with profound qualms: American dependence on the automobile, capital punishment, puritanical views, to name a few.</p>
        <p>But expatriates also gush about American politeness. They rave about Westchester County's open space and New York City's cultural riches. They admire the community involvement of residents. And they cannot get over the weather: one expatriate likened Westchester's light to that of Tuscany. There is, they say, a lot to miss.</p>
        <p>''It will be hard,'' said Kirsten Thoma-Cerny, a German lawyer who is returning with her family to Frankfurt this summer after seven years in Harrison. ''We got accustomed very much to this country. The Americans make it easy.''</p>
        <p>Helping to Make The Living Easier</p>
        <p>The economics of being an expatriate can be fairly attractive. Many families receive generous housing allowances, which rise along with an executive's corporate rank. Companies often pick up the tab, too, for private schools, furniture and trips home to visit family and friends.</p>
        <p>What follows is a snapshot of the financial package given to one Australian family in Scarsdale. The couple, who have two children, agreed to describe the perks of living abroad on the condition that their names not be used.</p>
        <p>Despite his company's largesse, the executive said his family's life style here was not lavish. ''We're living in a similar standard to how we would in Australia,'' he said. ''But everything is more expensive here.'' While his salary is paid in Australian dollars, the stipends for housing and other costs are paid in American dollars.</p>
        <p>HOUSING ALLOWANCE: The family gets $7,000 a month to spend on rental housing, a sum that nets a choice selection of homes, even in Scarsdale. But house rentals are scarce. ''We looked for six or seven weeks,'' the executive said of the family's search throughout the county. ''We looked at seven houses a day and by the afternoon, the houses were gone.''</p>
        <p>SCHOOLS: While some companies pay tuition for private schools, the Australian family is on its own. But the ample housing allowance enables them to live in one of Westchester County's finest school districts, and, of course, there is no language barrier.</p>
        <p>FURNITURE RENTAL: When they arrived, the couple went to a furniture showroom and picked out an instant interior for their three-bedroom house, from sofas and beds to rugs and lamps. The company pays the $600 a month it costs to rent the furniture.</p>
        <p>UTILITIES: The company throws in another $600 a month to cover the family's utility expenses, which include phone, gas heat and electricity.</p>
        <p>HOME LEAVE: Once a year, the company flies the family back to Australia. The cost of the round-trip, business-class fares is $15,000.</p>
