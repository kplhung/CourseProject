        <p>Clifford Brown</p>
        <p>The Life and Art</p>
        <p>of the Legendary Jazz Trumpeter.</p>
        <p>By Nick Catalano.</p>

        <p>Given the chance to alter the past, many a jazz lover would go back to a gas station off the Pennsylvania Turnpike on the night of June 26, 1956. There, near Bedford, Pa., the time traveler would disable a car belonging to a young pianist, Richie Powell, who would otherwise die moments later in a one-car crash on the rain-slicked road. Powell (whose more celebrated brother was Bud Powell) died with his wife, Nancy, and one of the bright lights of the history of bop, the trumpeter Clifford Brown. They were on the way to Chicago to meet the drummer Max Roach, the co-leader of the Brown-Roach Quintet, among the most explosive jazz groups ever. Although only 25 years old when he died, Brown already had revolutionized the sound of the jazz trumpet with his huge, brassy tone and impeccable yet rapid-fire articulation. Critics say his sound -- crisp, clean and beautiful -- reflected his life: disciplined, organized and sweet. He provided an enormous contrast to so many other jazz giants of the 1950's, who dissipated their talents and lives with drugs and alcohol. It was Brown's example, Nick Catalano writes in ''Clifford Brown: The Life and Art of the Legendary Jazz Trumpeter,'' that rescued the tenor saxophonist Sonny Rollins from probable drug-induced disaster. Catalano, who teaches music and literature at Pace University, has produced a pastiche of a biography; between lengthy, blow-by-blow descriptions of recording dates and albums, he includes a thin mortar of biographical data. How, the reader wonders, did this budding genius arrive here, and what is it about his short life and small opus that still manages to inform jazz?</p>
