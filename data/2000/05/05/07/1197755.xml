        <p>Brilliant goals by Patrik Elias and John Madden, and two marvelous assists by Scott Gomez led the Devils to a 4-3 triumph over the Toronto Maple Leafs tonight at the Air Canada Center that left them just one victory from the Eastern Conference finals.</p>
        <p>With a 3-2 series lead in the four-of-seven-game semifinal series, the Devils can advance with a victory Monday night at Continental Arena in New Jersey. They will be confident, because they have dominated most of this series. But they will also be mindful that if things had gone just a little bit differently tonight, they could be the team on the brink of elimination.</p>
        <p>Toronto took the lead twice tonight on goals by unlikely sources -- the defensive specialist Garry Valk and the brand-new rookie Jeff Farkas. But the Devils showed plenty of character by rallying with three unanswered goals in the second and third periods before Sergei Berezin narrowed the gap for the Maple Leafs in the final stages of the game.</p>
        <p>At that point, the Maple Leafs tried ferociously to tie the score, and for the final 17 seconds, they even had a two-man advantage because they had pulled goalie Curtis Joseph after the Devils captain Scott Stevens had been sent to the penalty box for hooking. After the Devils withstood the final threat, a melee erupted as the clock ran out, involving among others, Devils goalie Martin Brodeur and Stevens, who raced out of the penalty box to go to the aid of his teammates.</p>
        <p>With Maple Leafs fans littering the ice with garbage, players from both teams stood in front of their benches and barked at each other before the game officials finally escorted them to the tunnels for the dressing rooms.</p>
        <p>''There was a lot of emotion out there,'' said Stevens, who delivered a number of crunching checks to inspire the Devils. ''I did have a couple of good hits,'' added the defenseman, who was voted the game's top star by the news media even through he did not have a point in the game.</p>
        <p>Still, while Stevens delivered the hits, it was the team's more skillful players who came through for the Devils. The goal by Elias, coming with 3 minutes 19 seconds left in the opening period and tying the score at 1-1, left everyone in awe.</p>
        <p>Taking a pass from Scott Niedermayer in the neutral zone, Elias entered Toronto's end of the ice with a great deal of speed. Just when it looked as if Darcy Tucker had him figured in the right circle, Elias dropped his left shoulder to get behind Tucker and put the puck in the upper far corner of the net from a sharp angle at a time when he appeared to be headed around the goal.</p>
        <p>''I saw them making a change and jumped into it right away,'' Elias said. ''I got lucky with the shot, but I don't care. They all count the same.''</p>
        <p>Gomez's passes were not far behind in terms of brilliance, especially his behind-the-back pass to Vladimir Malakhov to set up the Devils' third goal, the one that put them ahead 7:47 into the third period.</p>
        <p>''We picked it up in the third,'' Devils Coach Larry Robinson said.  ''It was nice to see Malakhov get a goal.''</p>
        <p>Robinson managed to come up with the right matchups for most of this game, but he had to juggle his line combinations a bit. The biggest change came in taking Claude Lemieux off the Gomez line and inserting Alexander Mogilny.</p>
        <p>''I did it for both defensive and offensive reasons,'' said Robinson,  who surprised no one by putting Sergei Brylin back in the lineup in place of Steve Kelly after Brylin had missed six games with a bruised right knee.</p>
        <p>He role tonight was to be on the ice as much as possible against the opposition's top forwards, but he did not get that many chances because Toronto Coach Pat Quinn had the last change and avoided that matchup.</p>
        <p>Valk's goal opened the scoring  midway through the first period. After Elias tied the score, Farkas regained the lead for the Maple Leafs with his first N.H.L. goal.</p>
        <p>The next goal, with 4:01 to play in the second, came on a mistake by Toronto defenseman Greg Andrusak, who allowed Gomez to pass to Sergei Nemchinov in the slot. With plenty of time and space, Nemchinov beat Joseph with a low shot for his third goal of the playoffs to send the teams into the third period tied at 2-2.</p>
        <p>After Malakhov's go-ahead goal, Madden extended the lead to 4-2 with 5:53 left in the game. The margin looked comfortable, but the Devils barely held on.</p>
