      <block class="full_text">
        <p>A RISE in telecommunications competition spawned by deregulation is emerging as a culprit in last month's knotty Suffolk County transition from the 516 area code to 631.</p>
        <p>Maneuvering by two dozen carriers for Long Island market share appears to have caused some of the glitches. Too many carriers were either too inexperienced with the split along the Nassau-Suffolk border or unable to coordinate efforts with other telephone service providers to make the split work seamlessly.</p>
        <p>And one carrier, Allegiance Telecom, said it never received some instructions from the New York State Public Service Commission, which mandated the area code change.</p>
        <p>The causes of the snags emerged in interviews with carriers and regulators locally and in Minnesota, which is undergoing area code splits similar to Long Island's, and from nearly 200 pages of legal documents released last week by the Public Service Commission.</p>
        <p>Carriers serving the Long Island market submitted the legal papers to the agency last week in response to the commission's order to explain why the glitches happened and how they were being fixed. The commission will decide at a hearing if they will be fined $100,000 for each lapse in service.</p>
        <p>In its legal response and an interview, Bell Atlantic said it predicted problems with the split along the Nassau-Suffolk border when it was outvoted last year by newer carriers and lost its bid to execute an area code overlay instead. Existing numbers remain unchanged when a new area code is overlaid.</p>
        <p>''I think that our competitors probably like for our customers to be angry with us, and right now a lot of our customers are angry with us,'' said Dennis Wax, Bell Atlantic's director of regulatory relations. ''I don't think it's justified, but in many cases it's not understood who did it and why.''</p>
        <p>Although Bell Atlantic is the dominant incumbent carrier on the Island, it shifted the blame. It said problems might have cropped up when business customers did not adjust their own private branch exchanges, or PBX's. Other carriers, it said, might not have reprogrammed their own switching equipment.</p>
        <p>In their responses to the commission, carriers blamed a range of culprits, from each other to a sluggish postal service, for the glitches. They said their quick responses to relatively few customer complaints should prevent the levying of any penalties.</p>
        <p>The commission, in its April 21 show-cause order, sought explanations from the carriers on shortcomings in assigning the new area code, educating customers about the change and intercepting incorrectly dialed calls with recorded messages.</p>
        <p>Some carriers lease switching capabilities from Bell Atlantic and said it bore at least some responsibility. North American Telecommunications Corporation of Westbury, for instance, said that it served a small number of residential customers using resold Bell Atlantic services.</p>
        <p>MCI Worldcom, which operates three switches that serve Long Island, similarly said it was not responsible for the ''overwhelming majority'' of customer complaints.</p>
        <p>It said it largely served residential customers on the Island through leased switching from Bell Atlantic. MCI Worldcom said in its legal response that it ''depends'' on Bell Atlantic ''for proper assignment of area codes'' and that ''the switching process is not within MCI Worldcom's control.''</p>
        <p>The company added that ''calls receiving intercept messages incorrectly included local calls and long-distance calls from several carriers.'' Specifically, MCI Worldcom said, calls to numbers with a (516) 962 area code and exchange failed because Bell Atlantic mistakenly converted those prefixes to 631 962.</p>
        <p>The commission also said it had received complaints from Suffolk alarm companies that had not been able to receive calls dialed with a 516 area code even though the companies were granted permission to receive incoming calls with either area code until Oct. 31, 2001. The commission granted the extension to give some companies time to adjust the automatic dialing features in their customers' burglar and fire alarms.</p>
        <p>In the first week of April, after the ''permissive dialing'' period ended for most Suffolk recipients of the new area code, Electronix Systems Central Station Alarms Inc. in Huntington Station did not receive signals from some burglar alarms and environmental temperature alarms it monitors, said Fred Leonardo, the company's president.</p>
        <p>In those instances the problems were apparently either false alarms or not life threatening, Mr. Leonardo said, but the risk for a worse scenario was high. ''The big problem, of course, with the area code change is the potential loss of life and limb if we had a fire in a Manhattan high rise and the fire alarm went off and we didn't get the signal,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Electronix Systems' area code snags were not the fault of Bell Atlantic but of smaller carriers, Mr. Leonardo said, and a source close to the situation identified MCI Worldcom as the cause of a bulk of the company's dialing troubles.</p>
        <p>But in its legal response to the P.S.C. last week, MCI Worldcom said its network automatically scheduled the disconnection of 10 exchanges that should have remained connected because an unnamed carrier failed to notify it of the details on the exchanges.</p>
        <p>Another carrier, Allegiance Telecom, said permissive dialing for customers with three exchanges was interrupted for three and a half weeks because it had ''no record of having been served'' with a March 24 order from the commission to grant an extension to customers with the codes. The company said it enacted the extension on April 27, when it ''became aware'' of the month-old order.</p>
        <p>Bell Atlantic and others maintain that splitting area codes along political lines is a rare and difficult approach. Carriers typically split codes along rate center boundaries -- the Nassau-Suffolk border traverses three rate center areas -- that typically do not run along political lines.</p>
        <p>Natural obstacles and available locations for carriers to lease space for their equipment and switching offices usually determine rate center boundaries, said Jack Ott, a numbering planner at U.S. West, which is in the midst of an area code split along city borders in Minnesota that is similar to Long Island's.</p>
        <p>But the Minnesota split is more complex because it involves several area codes. A first phase was completed last year, and state officials said the carrier reprogrammed administrative and operational software and upgraded switching hardware to accommodate the more advanced software with only minor problems.</p>
        <p>Diane Wells, a telecommunications analyst in the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission, said a second phase of the split was proving more challenging because more telecommunications competitors were on the scene since the first phase. But Ms. Wells predicted that the problems would be overcome and said the Public Utilities Commission there would not have to threaten the carriers with fines.</p>
        <p>She said the affected Minnesota markets had 20 to 30 carriers vying for market share there -- about the same as in the Long Island market. But the Minnesota permissive dialing period is more than twice as long as the five months Suffolk residents and businesses received when the new Suffolk area code went into effect last November.</p>
