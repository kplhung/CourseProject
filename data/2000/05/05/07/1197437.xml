        <p>EVERYBODY knows what you do with a wine cellar: you keep wine in it. But wine lovers, and anybody who's ever lived with a wine lover, know that storage is only part of the story.</p>
        <p>''Honey, I'll be down in the cellar,'' does not mean that the wine lover is going to make sure that the wine is resting at a stable cellar temperature of 50 to 60 degrees, or that the bottles are properly insulated from vibration and light. The cellar is not simply a storage unit but a spiritual sanctuary, a retreat for the wine lover to commune with objects of intense desire.</p>
        <p>Like those who crave porcelain pigs or Swedish glass, wine lovers are at heart collectors, and wine cellars are where they go to be surrounded by their collection. A truly obsessed wine lover can always find something to do there: comparing and handling the endless variety of tapered bottles, cataloging the holdings in new and different ways, going over old tasting notes, making plans for future uncorkings, it really makes no difference. The important thing is the security of knowing that those bottles belong to you, and that pleasure awaits. Like a child with an overflowing bag of Halloween candy, a full cellar means you can rest easy.</p>
        <p>Beyond its psychological function, there are sound physical and historical reasons for storing wines in cellars. Unlike distilled spirits, which are largely inert and can withstand all sorts of duress, fermented beverages like wine are alive and fragile. Exposure to air, heat and light changes wine chemically. When this exposure is carefully managed, fine wines that are intended for aging can last for decades. If wines are treated roughly, they can turn to vinegar, a word that is in fact derived from the French term for sour wine.</p>
        <p>Ancient wine drinkers stored their beverages in caves, which were dark, quiet, protected and at a constant cool temperature. Some champagne producers still use limestone caves in their region to store thousands and thousands of bottles before they are ready to be released.</p>
        <p>Cellars are intended to duplicate the conditions of these caves. Ideally, a wine cellar should be kept at 50 to 60 degrees, but even a little warmer is all right as long as violent swings in temperature can be avoided. Humidity can be a good thing because it prevents corks from drying out and allowing oxygen into the bottles. This also is why wine bottles are stored horizontally, to keep the liquid in contact with the cork. The disadvantage of humidity is that it can destroy paper labels, which is why winemakers with damp cellars do not put labels on their bottles until they are ready to remove them from their cellars and ship them. Those who collect wines as investments also avoid excess humidity because pristine labels enhance the value of their bottles.</p>
        <p>The first rule of wine collecting is that the number of bottles owned invariably exceeds the available storage space. No matter how big the cellar, they often seem to overflow with bottles and cases, making it imperative to keep careful records of which wines are stored where in the cellar. Usually wine lovers think ahead, selecting bottles to go with dinners days in advance. But on those last-minute occasions, as the cellar dweller pores over a couple thousand bottles looking for that special wine, those waiting upstairs as a meal sits cooling are bound to get impatient.</p>
