        <p>For Jameisha Barnes, the gulf between the home in Pennsylvania where she has stayed for the past two summers and her mother's apartment in the Bronx is not merely distance.</p>
        <p>''In New York, I don't have a swimming pool,'' said Jameisha, 9. ''I don't have three bedrooms. I don't have a bathroom with a Jacuzzi in it. I don't have two floors.''</p>
        <p>But the most enticing difference may be outside the home -- the sunny fields beckoning her to come out and play.</p>
        <p>''I live in a building,'' Jameisha said quietly.</p>
        <p>Jameisha, who shares a room with her younger sister in a fifth-floor walk-up apartment on Findlay Avenue, has been able to get a break from the city during the last three summers because of a program offered by the Fresh Air Fund, a nonprofit agency that has provided more than 1.7 million needy children from New York City a free opportunity to enjoy the country air since 1877.</p>
        <p>Last year 5,300 children from the city stayed with host families in rural and suburban communities from Maine to Virginia through the agency's Friendly Town program. The fund also provided vacations for 3,000 children at its five camps in Fishkill, N.Y.</p>
        <p>The programs are made possible in large part by donations. Last year, the fund received more than $5 million from 55,000 gifts that ranged from just a few pennies to thousands of dollars, said Jenny Morgenthau, the agency's executive director.</p>
        <p>This year, Ms. Morgenthau said, the agency hopes to increase the number of children in the Friendly Town program to 6,000.</p>
        <p>That number includes Jameisha, who is looking forward to going to Stroudsburg, Pa., again this summer. Host families volunteer to take a child or two into their homes for two weeks or more to show them a little about what life can be like away from the sizzling streets and peer pressure in the city.</p>
        <p>''It's the little things that we take for granted'' that make the vacation meaningful, Ms. Morgenthau said, ''like being able to leave a baseball glove in the backyard without worrying that someone will steal it, or seeing there are always stars out.''</p>
        <p>Out in the country, the children can experience a far different life.</p>
        <p>Donavan Woodley, a 12-year-old from Harlem, said he went fishing on Lake Erie last summer and hopes to do it again.</p>
        <p>Over a lunch in Ms. Morgenthau's Midtown office with several others who had been in the program, Donavan described how he had prepared the fish.</p>
        <p>''The guy was taking out all the guts and the bones and stuff,'' he said, to the collective groan of others at the table.</p>
        <p>Therese Stover, an 11-year-old from Harlem, reminisced about a fishing trip with her host family, too, in New Haven, Vt.. ''When we went fishing there were bats flying over us,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Options for a summertime activity for children from poorer families are often limited. Jameisha's mother, Tynisha Poole, said she did not know how Jameisha would spend her summer if it were not for the fund. It would cost $1,000 to send two of her daughters to summer camp, Ms. Poole said.</p>
        <p>An administrative assistant at a private school for mentally retarded children, Ms. Poole said she saves $75 a week when Jameisha is away in the country that she would normally pay a baby sitter.</p>
        <p>Families seeking to become hosts or those who would like to register their children for a Fresh Air summer vacation can call (800) 367-0003. Tax-deductible contributions can be sent to the Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018.</p>
