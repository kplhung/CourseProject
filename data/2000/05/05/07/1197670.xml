        <p>Awash in the nautical lexicon are a sea of oxymorons -- small gale, light anchor, jumbo shrimp -- that at first take seem like contradictions, but which upon further review are marvels of concise description. But tomorrow, off Fort Lauderdale, Fla., a race begins that is centered on a waterborne concept -- offshore beach catamarans -- that many find impossible to grasp.</p>
        <p>''You're right, you hear people talking about offshore beach cats and you wonder what doesn't belong in there,'' said the 45-year-old multihull whiz Randy Smyth, laughing. ''Probably the people.''</p>
        <p>Speaking by phone from Florida, Smyth, the five-time winner and defending champion of the Worrell 1000, should know. For when the 20-odd two-person crews launch through the morning surf in Fort Lauderdale to start the first of 11 legs en route to Virginia Beach, Smyth will be the odds-on favorite. When asked how many times he has competed in the Worrell, his answer is short: ''Enough to know better.''</p>
        <p>For the uninitiated, the 1,000-mile race is the frenzied dream child of the Virginia restaurateur Michael Worrell, who has seen the event evolve from a four-team, nonstop torture test among like-minded maniacs, in 1974, to a highly-organized affair that includes dedicated shoreside crews that follow the sailors up the coast; an international fleet of top-flight competitors; and copious safety rules and precautions.</p>
        <p>''But there are still a lot of great sailors who look at this event and say it's not their cup of tea,'' Worrell said. ''But for a certain cadre of hard-core sailors, this is their thing.''</p>
        <p>One must be hard-core to even contemplate a Worrell, because as the fleet hopscotches its way up the Atlantic seaboard -- each leg averages about 100 miles, and two of them are overnight runs -- the air and water temperatures plummet while the odds of being ambushed by a weather front thundering off the coast shorten.</p>
        <p>Last year, that confluence occurred at the worst possible time and place: Cape Hatteras, N.C. Even though there were no injuries, one boat was dismasted and three more sustained significant damage.</p>
        <p>'The thousand-fathom line is very, very close to Hatteras,'' Worrell said, referring to the shelf delineating deep and shallow water in the Western Atlantic. ''These huge ocean swells come roaring in from the sea and literally trip over Hatteras. That's why the surf is so huge there.''</p>
        <p>Cape Hatteras aside, landing and taking off in rolling surf is a threat to hulls, rigs and rudders at every checkpoint. But for Smyth -- a two-time Olympic silver medalist in Tornado catamarans -- the nighttime legs bring the most fearful conditions. ''You're zipping along, it's pitch black, and there are all sorts of shoals out there, many of which move around and are uncharted,'' Smyth said.</p>
        <p>''So you're flying at 20 knots and, bingo, you hit a six-inch spot of thin water. The boat stops but you just keep on flying.''</p>
        <p>This year the Worrell is being contested in identical Inter 20 catamarans, which should boost the hopes of another Florida skipper, Brian Lambert, a class veteran. But Smyth's deck seems stacked; his crew, Matt Struble, a former Michigan State pole-vaulter, is also the reigning Inter 20 North American champion. Ultimately, Smyth believes his greatest threat will come from the Australian duo of Brett Dryland and Rod Waterhouse, who finished second last year and have raced in a combined 17 Worrells between them.</p>
        <p>At the other end of the spectrum are the half-dozen or so teams entering their first Worrell 1000. Among the rookies are the event's first female skipper, Susan Korzeniewski of Liverpool, N.Y., and her crew, Davis Murray of St. Thomas, V.I.</p>
        <p>Korzeniewski, a champion Hobie 16 sailor, has realistic expectations. ''We haven't practiced a lot in this type of boat,'' she admitted. ''It's going to take a little time to get up to speed with some of the other teams. But we hope to sail respectably and stay with the fleet.''</p>
        <p>In Murray, a boatbuilder and seasoned offshore sailor, she has a game partner with similar aspirations. ''Our goal is to race hard every day and sail smart without breaking anything,'' he said. ''If we come in last and that's the best we can do against these guys, we'll be very happy with that. What we really want to do is finish the race.''</p>
        <p>Those who avoid breakdowns and misfortune are due in Virginia Beach on May 20. ''Electrical storms, whales, sharks, military exercises, fishing piers -- there're all kinds of things waiting out there,'' Smyth said. ''It's kind of a fun race because it's a new story every day. And none of us know what it's going to be.''</p>
