        <p>The Strange History of the Ostrich</p>

        <p>By Rob Nixon.</p>

        <p>The thing most people know about the ostrich is the thing that isn't true. No matter how terrified or addled, no ostrich will try to hide by burying its head in the sand. And yet, as Rob Nixon points out in ''Dreambirds,'' both the illusions and the realities surrounding this ''gawky, boneheaded creature'' make it the perfect embodiment of ''the follies -- and temptations -- of denial.''</p>
        <p>To Nixon, writing about the ostrich involves much more than setting the record straight about a bird so puzzling to early naturalists that it was classified as Struthio camelus, the sparrow camel. He's also fascinated by the colorful story of the ostrich as disaster-prone cash cow, first in South Africa 100 years ago and then in the late-20th-century United States, Nixon's adopted homeland. And there's still another story lurking at the fringes of his witty and informative explorations of ornithology, commerce and greed -- an excursion into the emotional recesses of his Scottish immigrant family. Somehow, it seems perfectly fitting that ''Dreambirds'' should turn out to be an intimate memoir masquerading as a far-flung exercise in natural and social history.</p>
        <p>Nixon grew up in Port Elizabeth, South Africa, near the vast wasteland known as the Great Karroo, and his father, a reporter for a small provincial newspaper, regularly dragged him off into this scrubby wilderness, hunting down drought-defying material for his weekly gardening column, ''Growing Things.'' At the age of 11, in ''one of those contrapuntal movements at which children excel,'' young Rob began to keep a diary called ''Flying Things.'' Like so many sons, Nixon was determined to become his father's opposite: ''He knew everything about roots, so I became obsessed with flight.'' But the Karroo's most significant bird was the flightless ostrich, which piqued the curiosity of the apprentice ornithologist, as did the decrepit Karroo town of Oudtshoorn, former site of the fabulously lucrative trade in ostrich feathers, which a few generations earlier had yielded a product ''ounce for ounce, more precious than gold.''</p>
        <p>Once known as the Jerusalem of Africa for its colony of Lithuanian Jewish feather merchants, Oudtshoorn had long since sunk into a severely Calvinist Afrikaner gloom. (The Oudtshoorn of his youth was, Nixon remarks, in one of the nicely telling phrases that punctuate his book, ''a one-mistake town,'' a ''purgatorial'' community where ''your destiny could be sealed by gossip about a glance.'') The most visible remnants of Oudtshoorn's glory days were the crumbling architectural fantasias known as feather palaces, grandiose mansions whose owners, at the height of the boom in 1913, supplied 100,000 tons of plumes to trim the hats and gowns of fashion-conscious women -- until World War I rendered this sort of display obsolete among all but the most theatrical of consumers. The bottom fell out of the ostrich-feather market in a humblingly precipitous fashion. ''One ostrich merchant framed two checks as a record of the speed with which he had been ruined,'' Nixon reports. ''The first, a 1914 check for</p>
