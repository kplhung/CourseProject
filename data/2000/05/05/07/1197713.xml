        <p>Three weeks ago, after Fusaichi Pegasus demolished a very competitive Wood Memorial field, Kent Desormeaux knew that the colt on whom he had never lost a race would be the clear favorite for the Kentucky Derby.  At any other time in his accomplished riding career, the prospect of visiting the winner's circle of America's most famous horse race for a second time would have consumed the high-strung Louisiana native.</p>
        <p>But in the previous weeks, Desormeaux, 29, had other things on his mind. His wife, Sonia, had noticed the couple's year-old son, Jake, did not seem to respond to her singing and tender addresses. He stirred more often at the vibrations of footsteps. So last month they took him to doctors, who eventually discovered that the youngster, who Desormeaux had cheerfully boasted was tall, dark and handsome -- ''he'll at least be 5 feet 6 inches,'' the jockey said -- was deaf.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the rider's attention shifted from his big horse to his small boy. And this look inward came just as the public was turning Fusaichi Pegasus into one of the most talked-about horses in years. Here was a $4 million colt who had won four of his five races in almost cinematic fashion, a massive horse who seemed barely able to contain the cord of muscle under his skin.</p>
        <p>In fact, after the Wood, racing enthusiasts in New York began referring to Fusaichi Pegasus as the Hunk. Yet, he also was headstrong and eccentric. In the days leading up to the Derby, the colt's predawn gallops often featured nose-to-tail bucking, an obstinate tendency to want to remain in his stall and, in one well-reported instance, the dumping of his exercise rider -- prompting his trainer, Neil Drysdale, to bring in a new exercise rider, Andy Durnin, who had a reputation for connecting with difficult thoroughbreds.</p>
        <p>But on a glorious afternoon here today, Desormeaux was able to focus on the task at hand, and so was Fusaichi Pegasus. Together, they provided the millions who were watching the stirring sight of a rider making a decision on how to win a great race, and a powerful horse carrying the plan through.</p>
        <p>''He's a brilliant horse,'' Desormeaux said when it was all over.</p>
        <p>No one was quite certain of that when Fusaichi Pegasus left his barn this afternoon for the walk from the backside to the paddock. He did not disappoint those in the rowdy crowd of 153,204 who were searching for the colt's demonstrative neuroses. At one point Fusaichi Pegasus bucked a couple of times when Drysdale tried to toss a light gauze blanket over his sweating back. The horse's owner, the Japanese venture capitalist Fusao Sekiguchi, leaned on his cane and waited, as did the colts and owners of a half-dozen other competitors trailing behind.</p>
        <p>In the tunnel entering the paddock, Fusaichi Pegasus stopped, tossed his head and held up the procession again. This time Drysdale patted him and stood there, perfectly contented to let his horse lead the way when he wanted to. In his paddock stall, waiting for his saddle, the colt was more eager. He inched out, bobbing his nose, making it clear he was ready to run. In the paddock, Drysdale's instructions to Desormeaux were succinct:</p>
        <p>''The only thing I said was, don't come over too fast, come over gradually,'' said the trainer, who had never gotten a horse to the Derby starting gate until today.</p>
        <p>The horse and jockey did what they were asked. Fusaichi Pegasus broke so leisurely from the gate that he loped around the first turn with 14 horses ahead of him. ''This guy left the gate like a pony,'' said Desormeaux, who thought he might have put himself too far back.</p>
        <p>''But he was pulling back, trying to tell me that he was comfortable if I was comfortable,'' he added.</p>
        <p>In the backstretch, the rider guided his horse to the rail. They sped and slowed like a Cadillac negotiating rush hour -- measured and elegant. ''He'd slow down on his own because there was no place for him to go,'' Desormeaux said. ''He's smart. He knows what he wants.''</p>
        <p>The duo stayed inside around the far turn, spurting from 11th place to 6th without attracting much notice. Ahead of them, More Than Ready, Wheelaway, Trippi and Captain Steve were converging, bumping flesh and kicking dirt.</p>
        <p>At the quarter pole, Desormeaux tugged on the reins and asked Fusaichi Pegasus to angle right. He did. Seven wide, he floated around the horses in front of him. ''He's such a big horse it looks like he's just galloping, but you can feel this surge, he's so powerful,'' Desormeaux said.</p>
        <p>Fusaichi Pegasus did not so much pick off his rivals as make them disappear. Desormeaux kept his whip tucked and inched his hands up on his colt's neck as if he wanted to tickle his chin. The late runners, Aptitude and Impeachment, had little hope of catching him.</p>
        <p>For a triumphant 2:01.12, the impact of horse and rider snaking around the racetrack was all that really was needed to be said about the last couple of weeks.</p>
        <p>Things will be great, Desormeaux promised, at the Desormeaux home, where he and his wife and their older son, Josh, are learning sign language. He had won the Derby for the first time, in 1998, aboard Real Quiet. That was special, but this one was even better.</p>
        <p>''It's uplifting,'' Desormeaux said.</p>
