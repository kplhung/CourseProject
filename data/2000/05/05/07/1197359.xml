        <p>WHEN in the course of human events, musicians feel impelled to declare to the world and to themselves the highest ideals of which the individual and humanity are capable, the composer to whom they are most apt to turn is Beethoven.</p>
        <p>Thus, at the ceremony at which Wagner laid the foundation stone for his Festspielhaus at Bayreuth in 1872, what he presented was not his own Music of the Future but Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. In 1955, 10 years after suffering a direct hit in an Allied air raid, the rebuilt Vienna State Opera opened with ''Fidelio.''</p>
        <p>Today, the Vienna Philharmonic and the chorus of the Vienna Singverein under the baton of Simon Rattle strike a self-consciously epochal note with their live broadcast on Austrian radio of a concert from the quarry in Mauthausen, the concentration camp where, by the tens of thousands, victims of the Nazis were enslaved and worked to death. The musicians are playing for Mauthausen survivors, their families and the public: ''a declaration of humanity on a site of horror,'' says Clemens Hellsberg, the orchestra's president; a gesture of ''remembrance, repentance and homage,'' in Sir Simon's words.</p>
        <p>They are playing the Ninth Symphony, perpetuating a pattern that shows no sign of fading. When Kurt Masur and the New York Philharmonic rang in the millennium last year, the choice of the Ninth was not so much obvious as inevitable. It was equally so when Leonard Bernstein celebrated the reunification of Germany at the Berlin Wall in 1989. On that occasion, by Bernstein's wish, the clarion call ''Freude'' (''joy'') in the choral finale was replaced by ''Freiheit'' (''freedom''), perhaps a less daring liberty than it seems. Bernstein dreamed of revisiting the score on Mount Scopus once peace had come to the Middle East.</p>
        <p>''Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,''  ''liberte, egalite, fraternite'': like many another artist, not to mention ordinary citizens of every stripe, Beethoven felt the fire in the ringing catchwords of revolution. But he alone, by virtually universal consent, found the means to make music play out the passions those revolutionary ideals enshrine. The Ninth Symphony's ''Ode to Joy,'' cresting in a vision of a universal brotherhood and a benign father beyond the stars, is one cardinal example.</p>
        <p>''Fidelio'' is another, on many counts: for Leonore's courage in her quest for Florestan, her husband, who languishes in the clutches of a tyrant; for Florestan's moral majesty at the brink of despair; for the heartbreaking nobility of the chorus of others also unjustly imprisoned, breathing free in the sun for a stolen hour.</p>
        <p>But Beethoven could make his music convey such ''stories'' of struggle and triumph even in the absence of text or an overt program, notably in his Symphony No. 3 (the ''Eroica,'' or ''Heroic''). Scott Burnham's book ''Beethoven Hero,'' published in 1995, examines in illuminating detail precisely this phenomenon and its consequences for the reception of Beethoven's music.</p>
        <p>By Mr. Burnham's count, the ''heroic'' style dominates in only two of the composer's nine symphonies, two of his 32 piano sonatas, one of his five piano concertos and several of his overtures. Yet its powerful halo effect has raised Beethoven's music -- indeed, his very name -- to the level of symbol.</p>
        <p>Which makes him the perfect figurehead for a series of six free concerts by the Orion String Quartet, presented by the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center at Alice Tully Hall beginning on Friday. Under the title Beethoven 2000, the series includes all 16 of the composer's string quartets. As Beethoven the keyboard virtuoso often did at charity fund-raisers in Vienna, the players are waiving their fee.</p>
        <p>''We've played all the quartets before but never as a cycle,'' said Steven Tenenbom, the Orion violist. ''We've been working toward this all our lives.''</p>
        <p>Described by the society as a gift to New York, Beethoven 2000 honors six nonprofit organizations in the five boroughs that in various ways devote their resources to engaging children with the arts. At each concert, one honoree is showcased in a short film clip or video and receives up to 200 tickets to use for fund-raising, incentives or whatever purpose it thinks best. Funds from grants by Credit Lyonnais and other sponsors will be distributed to institutions as well, but recognition, not dollars, is the heart of the exercise.</p>
        <p>A handsome gesture, certainly, but where, exactly, is the connection? ''Beethoven came first,'' said Timothy Eddy, the Orion cellist. As quartet in residence with the Chamber Music Society, he and his colleagues took their dream project to Jacqueline Taylor, the society's executive director, and David Shifrin, the artistic director, who at once began thinking of added dimensions that would lift the cycle above obligatory chamber music routine.</p>
        <p>In announcing the project, Ms. Taylor offered her own rationale: ''All around us great organizations are doing their part to give meaningful opportunities to young people to experience life's brighter side through the remarkable world of the arts in all of its forms. Without their work, our work would not be possible, and our city would not be the extraordinary place that it is. We wanted to take the time to say 'thank you' to a few of these special organizations, invite them into our home and salute them for their achievements in the best way we know how -- with music.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tenenbom elaborated on the specific choice of composer: ''Beethoven reaches to express the struggle between man and the universe, between man and his own soul. He's universal, and he's visceral. That's a good choice for this kind of project. The organizations we're celebrating are changing lives out there, saving lives.''</p>
        <p>The oldest of them, by more than half a century, is the Brooklyn Children's Museum, which needs the least introduction. The Harlem School of the Arts, the Jamaica Center for Arts and Learning and the Bronx-based Mind-Builders Creative Arts Center, with similar mandates to build young people's self-respect and community spirit through discipline and achievement in the arts, opened in the 1960's and 70's.</p>
        <p>The Opus 118 Music Center, which finances the violin program of the East Harlem Public Schools, has gained worldwide recognition through the recent movie ''Music of the Heart,'' starring Meryl Streep as the real-life crusader Roberta Guaspari. (For the Orion players, Ms. Guaspari is not just the flavor of the month. Several summers back, Mr. Eddy taught her son cello at Musicorda, a music camp in Massachusetts, where she, too, served on the faculty.) The youngest of the honorees, and the most unusual, is the Songs of Love Foundation, an alliance of songwriters and musicians who write and record songs tailored to individual chronically or terminally ill children and young adults: more than 1,000 since 1996.</p>
        <p>Like most string quartets that endure, the 12-year-old Orion is a study in subtle and less subtle oppositions. Tall and lanky, Mr. Eddy, the most recent recruit, joined seven years ago. Studious and sensitive in appearance, he is soft-spoken yet readily communicative almost to the point of being confessional. Also lanky, very slightly shorter, Mr. Tenenbom stands just shy of six feet, looks like a tennis player and has quick, take-charge conversational reflexes to match.</p>
        <p>The violinists, who switch between first and second chairs, are the portly, bearded Daniel Phillips and Todd Phillips, Daniel's clean-shaven younger brother, both short of stature, lively yet at ease. Their father, a violinist with the Pittsburgh Symphony, played string quartets at home, notably at an annual New Year's Eve party, and it was not long before his sons were playing along on second fiddle.</p>
        <p>The four are hoping the concerts will attract a far more diverse demographic mix than the chamber-music norm. In particular, they hope to recognize many new young friends from the honored institutions. Since last fall, they have visited them all. Perhaps as targets of past acts of random guerrilla charity, some staff members there were frankly skeptical about this new relationship.</p>
        <p>Todd Phillips explained: ''They thought: 'Here comes a classical-music organization. They'll give a little concert.' But it's a mutual thing -- us going to them, them coming to us -- not some token effort to build audiences. At the Harlem School for the Arts, for instance, we went a first time to play for them from the stage. Then we came back for a little master class, and they played for us. The people at Mind-Builders told us, 'The more we learned about the whole Beethoven 2000 project, the more thrilled we became.' It was nice to hear.''</p>
        <p>Beethoven's lofty humanitarian yearnings notwithstanding, his tormented, complex personality was never well adapted to the needs and vulnerabilities of a young person. (Goethe called him ''utterly untamed.'') His history with his nephew and ward Karl, the one child who entered his biography in any significant fashion, reached its appalling turning point in Karl's botched suicide attempt at 19. Nor is Beethoven's music, in the main, what most would consider likely fare for young audiences.</p>
        <p>Should it be reserved for initiates? ''Don't make any assumptions,'' Mr. Tenenbom said. ''At a concert in New England not long ago, I was mortified to see three friends I'd invited each show up with a daughter, ages 9 and 10. I was sure the girls would fall asleep, but afterward they were totally excited. Later I got a letter from one of the women, who wrote, 'I saw on my daughter's face the power of music to move mountains.' ''</p>
        <p>Conceivably a roomful of children in a more familiar, less formal environment, less supervised by grown-up eyes, might react differently, but the Orion players, quick studies at the outreach game, have found ways to stack their deck.</p>
        <p>''To play an eight-minute movement is hard on a kid's attention span,'' Daniel Phillips said. ''So sometimes we'll play a movement of a quartet starting at the recapitulation.''</p>
        <p>Todd Phillips continued: ''Beethoven had feelings he wanted to express. It sounds simplistic, but with little kids, you don't talk in esoteric terms. The range is huge, from the simplest, folksiest, most unpretentious to thorny, abstruse and high-minded. Cosmic and personal: it's all there. We'll play something upbeat and ask, 'What did you feel?' And then we'll play a different section that's darker, sadder, quieter, more dancelike, angry even, and ask again.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Eddy picked up the story: ''Or we'll ask for a volunteer. There's always a volunteer. We'll play the fugue of Opus 59, No. 3. But first, we ask the volunteer to point to the person who's got the theme, which gets not only the volunteer involved but all the friends and grownups who are watching. It draws them into structure without using that fancy word.''</p>
        <p>Beyond the general idealistic impulse, can the players point to anything more tangible that binds a Beethoven cycle to a Brooklyn Children's Museum or a Songs of Love Foundation?</p>
        <p>''Giving the gift of this music to anyone who wants to come to hear it, and drawing attention to organizations with such high aspirations,'' Todd Phillips said, ''what could be more comprehensive? What could be a higher expression of our ideals?''</p>
        <p>When the great maestro Bruno Walter returned to the Vienna Philharmonic in 1947, he said: ''We musicians have a choice. Either we want to be of good will or not. And we must serve as an example.'' For him as for musicians everywhere, playing Beethoven was the way.</p>
