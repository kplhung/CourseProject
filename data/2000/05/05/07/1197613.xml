        <p>POLITICAL strategies come and go, but this one endures: never underestimate the political potency of motherhood.</p>
        <p>The leaders of the Million Mom March for ''common sense gun control'' next Sunday, Mother's Day, have a warm and fuzzy Web site (www.millionmommarch.com), a shrewd media effort and an aggressive grassroots organizing campaign. But above all, they are invoking a very old tradition in politics: trying to break through ideology and partisanship and make an appeal based on the moral authority of women as mothers.</p>
        <p>It worked for Mothers Against Drunk Driving, widely credited with helping to create a fundamental shift in society's attitudes toward drinking and driving. It worked for many of the women's clubs in the early part of this century, which historians say played a key role in passing much of the early social welfare legislation, like mothers' pensions and child and maternal health programs. It has been used in peace movements, here and in such places as Northern Ireland, in pro- and anti-abortion marches, in environmental struggles large and small.</p>
        <p>But in the current climate, in an election year when the gun control issue is the subject of fierce and intensely partisan maneuvering -- and when mothers are considered swing voters -- such a campaign is not without risks. Without more conventional political follow-up, some analysts say, the march could turn out to be a a day of powerful television images that will ultimately fade, and can thus be safely ignored by the legislators and candidates who are its target. And it casts women in a political role that some may find dated and limiting: as selfless nonpartisan defenders of hearth and home.</p>
        <p>Still, the mothers' march, which is open to men and is to be held in the nation's capital and some 60 other cities, could also have real power, several historians and analysts say. ''It's a really good way to bridge differences of ideology,'' said Annelise Orleck, an associate professor of history at Dartmouth and a scholar of mothers' movements. ''It makes possible at least a temporary coalition of a wider range of people than might have been drawn out by a march that was billed strictly as a gun control march.''</p>
        <p>And, she added: ''It becomes harder to attack. It will be very hard for the National Rifle Association or others to attack mothers speaking on behalf of their children.''</p>
        <p>Kate O'Beirne, a conservative commentator and Washington editor of National Review, agreed, predicting that the march will be ''lovingly'' covered by the news media. ''They'll get no skeptical coverage -- moms?''</p>
        <p>She added that the march, which supports an array of gun control measures like mandatory safety locks and the licensing of all handgun owners, was in fact deeply political. But it will define the argument, she said, so that ''anybody who demurs is clearly perfectly comfortable with 8-year-olds' risking gun violence in school cafeterias.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Bill Powers, spokesman for the National Rifle Association, offered a downright decorous response when asked about the mothers' march. ''We seem to be a lot of people's favorite target to beat up, but the men and women who are part of the N.R.A. want their children to be safe just as much as anyone else wants their children to be safe,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Donna Dees-Thomases, a New Jersey mother who is the main organizer of the march, said she was galvanized by the image of children, hand in hand, being led from a Jewish community center in Granada Hills, Calif., last August, after a gunman's shooting rampage. She said she took MADD as her inspiration, and found it easy to mobilize mothers in the wake of a succession of school shootings, several of them in middle-class suburbia. ''The first five or 10 women I spoke to about this, we all had the same reaction to what was going on in the country around guns,'' she said. ''Our maternal instincts were just kicking in.''</p>
        <p>In fact, some pollsters say that after the shooting last year at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., which left 15 dead, support for stronger gun laws initially soared, especially among women. Moreover, there is what Linda DiVall, a Republican pollster, calls a ''huge gender gap'' on the issue. A poll by CBS News in March found that 56 percent of the men responding said laws governing the sale of handguns should be made stricter; 73 percent of the women did.</p>
        <p>SOME analysts say the Democratic Party's support for stricter gun laws could help deliver the middle-of-the-road suburban mothers both parties are courting. But polls indicate that any such advantage has yet to materialize. Many Republican leaders have been arguing that the problem is not the strength of existing gun laws, but the lack of vigorous enforcement. And that message has appeal,  Ms. DiVall said.</p>
        <p>Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster, said, ''The issue's been confused,'' but argued that the mothers' march could sway voters.</p>
        <p>The march's organizers, of course, say they hope to transcend any struggle for partisan advantage. ''Everyone truly believes that until we get the politics out of this, nothing much will get done,'' said Ms. Dees-Thomases, currently on leave from her job as a part-time publicist for CBS. ''This is a public health issue.''</p>
        <p>The march's Web site drives home the beyond-politics message again and again: ''This is personal, not political. We are in this for one reason alone: to keep our kids safe.'' In a ''Tapestry'' section, typical postings about the march run like this: ''I lose sleep at night thinking about the future of my 3-year-old child and my one expected in June.'' ''After watching the Oprah show on Tuesday, I decided to turn in the only gun I have, a handgun.''</p>
        <p>March organizers say elected officials will not be prominently featured in the day's program in Washington, although two will speak, both of them women with experience in gun violence in their own families: Representative Carolyn McCarthy, a Democrat whose husband was killed and son was severely wounded in the Long Island Rail Road shooting in 1993, and Maryland Lt. Gov. Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, the daughter of Robert F. Kennedy.</p>
        <p>Theda Skocpol, a professor of government and sociology at Harvard, said the march organizers had clearly ''rediscovered a very traditional formula'' that still had power even though the status of women has been transformed. Ms. Skocpol, the author of ''Protecting Soldiers and Mothers: The Political Origins of Social Policy in the United States'' (Harvard University Press, 1992), noted that mothers' movements were very strong in the early years of the 20th century, before women had the vote, when many women defined the political process ''not as voting, but as shaping public opinion, creating some kind of moral consensus, appealing to the reason and the values of public officials.''</p>
        <p>IN her book, she quotes Mrs. Imogen B. Oakley, a leader in the General Federation of Women's Clubs, who declared in 1912: ''In this country, owing to partisan politics, the authorities are prone to spend so much time wrangling over the spoils of office that they have little left for civic improvement.'' As a result, she said, ''the initiative in civic matters has devolved largely upon women.''</p>
        <p>Rheta Childe Dorr, the author of a book about clubwomen in politics, wrote in 1910 that a woman's place was in the home. But she added: ''Home is not contained within the four walls of an individual home. Home is the community. The city full of people is the family. The public school is the real nursery. And badly do the home and the family and the nursery need their mother.''</p>
        <p>The framing of an issue as a mothers' movement still works ''not because they see women separately, as part of a separate sphere, but because women are still especially concerned about children,'' Ms. Skocpol said. Still, she and many analysts say there are obvious limitations to these movements. Efforts to recast poverty as a children's issue -- including a Stand for Children rally in Washington in 1996 -- did not stop the passage of a welfare reform law that its organizers deplored. Powerful images are no substitute for political muscle and continued organizing.</p>
        <p>Ms. Dees-Thomases said her movement is keenly aware of that, and will announce plans for follow-up on the day of the march. In the meantime, the Million Mom March has competition in the imagery war: the Second Amendment Sisters, a group of women who plan a counterdemonstration that day on behalf of gun rights, to underscore how important guns are to protect hearth and home.</p>
