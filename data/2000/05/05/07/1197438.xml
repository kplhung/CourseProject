        <p>HER married name is Hedda Tesman but it is not her rightful one, so don't dare to use it. If you do, she will be displeased, and Hedda is the classic case study of a woman who doesn't forget and doesn't forgive.</p>
        <p>Besides, Ibsen did not call his play ''Hedda Tesman,'' not because that's not too catchy. If he cared about box-office titles, he would not have written ''Rosmersholm.'' His much maligned, and as much misunderstood, caged woman remains the tantalizing Hedda Gabler trapped eternally -- at the age of 30 -- in a marriage of compromise to a pedantic man who worships and bores her.</p>
        <p>In the director Doug Hughes's new version of ''Hedda Gabler'' at the Long Wharf Theater's Stage II in New Haven, no time is wasted displaying Hedda's entrapment. In a stunning prologue without words -- only sounds and voices and whispers inside her head -- Martha Plimpton, a visualization of panic as Hedda, tries desperately to bolt across the narrow space in front of the stage, darting from wall to wall, her every move thwarted by those taunting interior sounds.</p>
        <p>The obligatory exit signs at each end of the theater are switched on, but there is no door for Hedda, only the wall.</p>
        <p>The entrance of Hedda Gabler, as written, is a star's dream moment, unbeatable for build-up and anticipation. Lines like ''Hedda is the most beautiful thing of all'' are capped by the most breathcatching ''I think she's coming!''</p>
        <p>That Mr. Hughes's superimposed, seemingly premature introduction does not diminish Ms. Plimpton's spotlight moment is just one indication of the director's and the actress's considerable accomplishment.</p>
        <p>First and emphatically foremost, we have witnessed terror; the entrance is the surface, the mask we all assume, though few succeed so strikingly.</p>
        <p>Remarkably, Ms. Plimpton reveals the duality of ambivalence throughout. She wants to be fantastic; she will not settle for mediocrity. She is isolated but she wants not just to party, but to be the hostess. She is icily charming, the psychopathic precursor of what is now labeled an enabling personality. It is naive to assume that she or we must be compassionate, that the character must move us, that she is just too distancing.</p>
        <p>No playwright is duty bound to fulfill an audience's conventional need to feel. How can expectations of feeling be met when folks have different feelings?</p>
        <p>And is Hedda so weird in bemoaning an existence that demands spending ''every minute of one's life with the same person?'' Or in asking why she should be happy.</p>
        <p>The boundary breaker Ibsen -- ''the father of modern drama'' his textbook appellation -- saw to that. Consider Ibsen's statement, excerpted in the Long Wharf program: ''My plays make people feel uncomfortable because when they see them they have to think, and most people want to be effortlessly entertained, not to be told unpleasant truths.'' He then referred to ''people who are afraid of being alone with themselves, thinking about themselves.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hughes's foreboding directorial flourishes -- the crackling silences, the sounds of tension; the portrait of Hedda's father, not so much hung as hovering center stage; Hedda getting her gun and aiming it at the audience -- may appear obviously Freudian as well as Pinteresque.</p>
        <p>But they work within a whole constricting design, not the least part of which is the choice of placing ''Hedda Gabler'' in Long Wharf's 199-seat space, not on its main stage. Consequently, one truly feels what Hedda is up against. Talk about design, the stained walls (are they blotched with blood?) of the set designer Neil Patel's living room are integral to the director's concept.</p>
        <p>In a fine cast, Quentin Mare is an essentially wild Eilert Lovborg, the quintessential spirit of adventure and home wrecker. And the performance of Jenny Bacon as Thea, wretchedly married to a man who ''finds me useful'' illuminates another woman stifled.</p>
        <p>That ''Hedda'' was written 12 years after ''A Doll's House'' -- the theater world's all-time declaration of woman's independence -- is suddenly startling, newly disturbing. But the play did not change the world.</p>
        <p>''Hedda Gabler,'' Mr. Hughes and Ms. Plimpton style, is amazingly contemporary in its considerations of the purpose of life, of the preservation of dignity and integrity. Those are the big issues people don't dare to think about. And here is a staging that does not turn away from the prevalence and the perception of vindictive people. Look around.</p>
        <p>''Hedda Gabler,'' Long Wharf Theater, Stage II, 222 Sargent Drive, New Haven. (203) 787-4284. Performances through May 21.</p>
