        <p>An effort by a Democratic State Committee worker to videotape Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's news conference at a Midtown Manhattan hotel, a fairly routine practice in politics these days, ran into a roadblock yesterday: the City Hall press secretary.</p>
        <p>Sunny Mindel, the mayor's official press secretary, spotted the young woman with the camera  and began an aggressive effort to block the shot. Ms. Mindel first stepped in front of the woman. Then, as the woman hoisted her camera high, Ms. Mindel stood on her toes and held up a sheet of paper, trying to prevent the mayor from being videotaped. Ms. Mindel stopped when she noticed that a reporter was watching.</p>
        <p>Political workers with cameras, who are known as trackers, have become common at political events as campaigns gather videotape for potential use in advertisements. Many campaigns tolerate trackers, calculating that it is easier to accommodate an adversary than to get involved in distracting squabbles.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mindel's actions were unusual because she is an employee of City Hall, not the Giuliani campaign for the United States Senate. Mr. Giuliani has often criticized Hillary Rodham Clinton, his opponent, for drawing on the resources of the federal government to help her campaign.</p>
        <p>Reached later at her City Hall office, Ms. Mindel sought to dismiss the episode with a joke. ''Everyone knows the mayor is working on an instructional video on how the mayor of the City of New York responds to reporters at press conferences,'' she said. ''And I just didn't want to see a pirated copy escape first.''</p>
        <p>Asked why a City Hall employee was tending to Mr. Giuliani's campaign needs, she responded, ''I just gave you my answer,'' and refused to comment further.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani had campaign aides at his appearance yesterday, where he was talking with Liberal Party leaders, but they ignored the trackers.</p>
