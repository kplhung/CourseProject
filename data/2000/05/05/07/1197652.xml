        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It would have been nice if at least one of the authorities Anne Jarrell cites in ''The Face of Teenage Sex Grows Younger'' had been more enthusiastic about these changes. Instead, they tend to assume, as most adults do, that today's teenagers and  preteens who are stupidly experimenting with impersonal sex and will end up emotionally damaged and unable to form good relationships later in life. It would be nice if we recognized that the rules we grew up with have not worked very well, and perhaps the kids are subconsciously trying out a new and better approach.</p>
        <p>In our society, the sex drive is ubiquitous, and it must be terribly frustrating to be repeatedly told that the only way to deal with it is to ''wait till you are married.'' Why can't we adults accept the fact that the chief problem with teenage sex is not with the teenagers but with us, who for various reasons strongly disapprove of what they are doing?</p>

        <p>It would have been nice if at least one of the authorities Anne Jarrell cites in ''The Face of Teenage Sex Grows Younger'' had been more enthusiastic about these changes.

        <p>In our society, the sex drive is ubiquitous, and it must be terribly frustrating to be repeatedly told that the only way to deal with it is to ''wait till you are married.'' Why can't we adults accept the fact that the chief problem with teenage sex is not with the teenagers but with us, who for various reasons strongly disapprove of what they are doing?</p>
        <p>As a professor of public health, I must express support for many of the described activities. Nudity, mutual masturbation and fellatio, while not risk free, are clearly healthier than genital intercourse.</p>
        <p>They have many partners! Why not? For centuries, we have praised virginity and chastity, particularly for women, but only a minority of us have strictly adhered to those rules. In any other activity, we encourage adolescents to seek variety. Why is sex different?</p>
        <p>But preteens are not mature enough to appreciate sex! We obviously have an obligation to teach them. Sex education starting in the fifth grade is surely too late. Our goal should be kindergarten or earlier.</p>
        <p>Obviously few people will agree with these ideas, but I suggest that they are all worth discussing. Above all, let us not jump to the conclusion that our teenagers are stupid, ignorant or immoral.</p>
