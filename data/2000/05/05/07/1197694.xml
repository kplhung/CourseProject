        <p>In 1943, Walter Marx, a Jewish teenager, was fleeing the Nazis in a small town in northwest Italy. A young Italian woman saved his life by hiding him from German soldiers and helping him escape.</p>
        <p>More than 50 years passed, and though Mr. Marx made several trips back to the town, Borgo San Dalmazzo, the two did not meet again until a surprising and touching reunion last year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marx, now 74 and retired in Roslyn, N.Y., was invited to a ceremony in the town for a monument he had helped pay for, dedicated to the many townspeople who aided Jews driven there during the war.</p>
        <p>In his dedication speech, Mr. Marx spoke of the young woman in the town who once risked her life to save his, adding that he had not seen her again despite many searches.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, a 78-year-old woman came from the crowd crying. She hardly resembled the brave 22-year-old woman with a pretty smile and thick chestnut locks.</p>
        <p>''I remembered a beautiful girl, not a woman with white hair in her 70's,'' Mr. Marx said, ''but somehow I knew it was her.'' Weeping, the woman introduced herself as Magdalena Gibaudo. The two hugged as the crowd responded with applause and tears. He offered to treat Mrs. Gibaudo to a visit to New York to stay with him. She arrived on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Sitting on a leather couch in his large house on Long Island on Thursday evening, Mr. Marx and Mrs. Gibaudo, over tea and strawberries, discussed how to avoid traffic during their weekend of sightseeing in Manhattan. It was a far cry from sitting, 57 years ago, in her father's hotel, planning how to avoid Nazis and the train to Auschwitz while sneaking Mr. Marx to the underground.</p>
        <p>With a group of some 1,300 Jews fleeing France, Mr. Marx and his mother walked over the Alps and stopped at the small Italian town. The two stayed several nights at a small hotel called the Caballo Rosso, owned by Mrs. Gibaudo's father.</p>
        <p>But the Nazis soon rounded them up with other Jews and put them into a temporary camp in town. Mrs. Gibaudo would see Mr. Marx toiling in work crews in town. He injured his back pushing a truck and spent three months in a local hospital. She visited him there and visited his mother in the camp, bringing them food. But then the Jewish prisoners, including his mother, Johanna Marx, were put on the train to Auschwitz.</p>
        <p>Mr. Marx, whose father, Ludwig Marx, was arrested earlier in France and sent to a death camp in Poland, sneaked from the hospital on crutches and asked Mrs. Gibaudo to hide him in the hotel. Though she risked being shot by the Nazis, she took the teenager in and later guided him to the foothills of the Alps, where she introduced him to members of the Italian Underground.</p>
        <p>He agreed to work for the underground, and posed as an interpreter for the Nazi secret service. He discovered and helped foil a Nazi attack, he said, and was later wounded in a battle against German soldiers.</p>
        <p>After the war, he learned that his parents had died in the camps, and at age 19, he came to New York. He started an air freight business and married. He and his wife, Ellen, a German Jew who survived the Holocaust by living in a convent in Belgium, had three sons. Through the years he often took them back to Borgo San Dalmazzo, but the inn had been demolished, and he had no luck finding Mrs. Gibaudo.</p>
        <p>Recalling the war, Mrs. Gibaudo said risking her life for Mr. Marx and other Jews in danger was something that came ''del cuore,'' or from the heart.</p>
        <p>''I had to do it,'' Mrs. Gibaudo said, adding that she never forgot the terror in the face of that handsome 17-year-old who showed up on crutches one night at her father's hotel.</p>
        <p>''Helping him has remained one of the most important events in my life,'' she said. ''I always hoped he would come back, but I never really believed he would.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Gibaudo said she also helped Jewish prisoners, including Mr. Marx's mother, hobble onto trains with no idea that they were headed to death camps, a cruel twist that has long tormented her.</p>
        <p>''It is such a painful thing to remember walking those people to the train and watching them get on,'' she said. ''I cannot forget that. I cannot even read about it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Marx said he would always feel indebted to Mrs. Gibaudo and would always feel a special tie to Borgo San Dalmazzo.</p>
        <p>The horrible memories of persecution are indelible, he said, ''but the experience has helped me face life with a lot of courage, and surviving has given me a sense of pride.''</p>
