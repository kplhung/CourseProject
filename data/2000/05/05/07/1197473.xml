        <p>SCRAPPY guys like Frank Sinatra are what cemented Hoboken's reputation as the tough little blue-collar city with a rebellious nature.

        <p>SCRAPPY guys like Frank Sinatra are what cemented Hoboken's reputation as the tough little blue-collar city with a rebellious nature. So it is appropriate that well beyond the bobby-soxer decade, the city of Hoboken presents such insurgent performers as Patti Smith, Ronnie Spector and Joey Ramone at its annual Spring Art and Music Festival.</p>
        <p>Today's festival will turn Washington Street into a cultural emporium featuring an assorted group of more than 300 artisans, musicians and food vendors. While spring festivals occur all over the country, Hoboken's possesses a certain cool veneer that most other street fairs do not.</p>
        <p>And this year Hoboken is proving it with a vengeance.</p>
        <p>Ms. Spector's salacious naughty-girl image from the 1960's and Ms. Smith's reputation as the 70's archetypal poet-rebel might have mellowed over the years, but neither has lost her singularity. As for the dour-faced, long-haired Mr. Ramone, it is obvious that time has not dampened his seditious spirit either.</p>
        <p>Ms. Spector fronted the Ronettes, a trio of New York City Puerto Rican teenagers who became the quintessential 60's girl group. Her distinctively seductive voice, plaintive songs, heavy makeup, beehive hairdo, stiletto heels and short, tight slit skirts helped propel songs like ''Be My Baby,'' ''Baby, I Love You'' and ''Walkin' in the Rain'' to the top of the charts.</p>
        <p>Her most recent hit was her 1986 duet ''Take Me Home Tonight,'' a Grammy-nominated recording with Eddie Money. In 1999, she released an EP, ''She Talks to Rainbows,'' produced by Mr. Ramone.</p>
        <p>The Ramones subscribe to the minimalistic theory of rock. They stripped their songs to the basics, reveling in dumbed-down lyrics and a handful of loud chords, and with that, the quartet from Queens changed the face of music.</p>
        <p>The iconic Ms. Smith, now in her mid-50's, has slugged it out in the rock 'n' roll trenches for three decades. In 1978, the New Jersey-bred poet and rock singer joined another Garden State performer for her most successful recording -- ''Because the Night,'' a collaboration with Bruce Springsteen.</p>
        <p>Currently touring in support of her recently released CD ''Gung Ho,'' Ms. Smith has been getting some of the best reviews of her career. The album, while often sounding more joyful and melodic than previous work, still retains the intense, dark poetic power of the past.</p>
        <p>To round out the musical stew, a few local acts of note are performing, many of which are country-flavored like the Hoboken resident Bob Delevante, of the roots duo the Delevantes. He recently released a thoughtful, lyrical solo effort, ''Porchlight.''</p>
        <p>But what might steal the pre-headliner show is the clever deconstruction of Madonna's ''Like A Prayer'' by Elena Skye and the Demolition String Band, which blends alternative rockabilly, honky-tonk and country music into something called alternabilly.</p>
        <p>Other musical tastes will be satisfied by performances by the rockers Seeking Homer, Hoboken High School's production of ''Dreamgirls,'' the swing and Latin sounds of Swingadelic, the Afro-Cuban beats of Phoenix Rising, the salsa and merengue band Raffy and the Orchestra Saborengue, and the folk-styled songwriting of Scott E. Moore.</p>
        <p>For anyone seeking something other than music, there will be 30 international food vendors, oil paintings, watercolors, candle art, photography, temporary tattoos, hand-painted furniture, batik clothing and more.</p>
        <p>For children there will be clowns, magicians, pony rides and a petting zoo.</p>
        <p>But this is the territory of Ol' Blue Eyes'  -- one of the hippest music towns this side of Austin, Tex. Only a city like Hoboken can mix the classic songs of their Monroe Street favorite son with the modern rock alternative denizens of local clubs like Maxwell's. The result: Skanatra, a ska band that performs Sinatra classics.</p>
        <p>Ska, the forerunner of reggae music, derived from Jamaican and West Indian dance music, features catchy riffs of upbeat guitar, a powerful bass and drum rhythm section, and a prominent horn section.</p>
        <p>For Hoboken, when the rock-steady strains of ''My Kind of Town'' come drifting down Washington Street, it will be as if the ''Star Spangled Banner'' were being performed.</p>
