        <p>NEVER mind that J. P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs loosened their collars and Wall Street did not unravel. This summer, employees at Alliance Capital Management, the Manhattan investment firm, dare not turn up in khakis and blue button-down oxfords, or -- horrors! -- sundresses and sandals.</p>
        <p>A 22-page Business Etiquette Handbook, appended to the company's employee manual this spring, lays down the law that traditional business dress is the expected attire at all times at the company.</p>
        <p>But that is not the half of it. The company way of doing most everything, from declining wine at dinner (''do not turn the glass upside down'') to riding the elevator (''it is customary to face front''), is detailed in the new handbook, along with appropriate topics of workplace conversation (the arts, books, current events) and topics to avoid (gossip, illness, compensation).</p>
        <p>Perhaps Miss Manners would be proud; employees are not so sure. Reactions have ranged from humor to anger. ''People were sort of amazed at the whole thing,'' said one staff member who found the call for routine bathing and dental care in the Basic Hygiene section to be ''pretty outrageous.''</p>
        <p>Company officials declined to comment on matters of corporate policy. But because its headquarters on the Avenue of the Americas is often visited by brokers, wealthy clients and others, the company's motive for wanting best feet put forward is not much of a mystery.</p>
        <p>At least it made sense to an employee taking a cigarette break on Thursday at the rear of the building (never in front, of course). He said some of the guidelines were quite helpful -- like the mandate to ask someone on a crowded elevator to press a floor number rather than reaching over or across other riders. ''With women,'' he said, ''you never know what offends them.''</p>
        <p>And though he works in the facilities department, he said the dress code was understandable, but costly. He was smartly dressed in dark blue pants, light blue dress shirt and striped tie, with a two-way radio clipped to his belt. ''What are you going to do?'' he said with a shrug.</p>
        <p>One thing to do is keep up with the memos: a new one that made the rounds recently relented a bit. ''Business casual'' will, after all, be allowed on summer Fridays and every day in August.</p>
