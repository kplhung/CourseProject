        <p>RENTS for office space along the highway leading from the nation's capital to Washington-Dulles International Airport are soaring as companies involved in telecommunications and the Internet compete for the limited space available. Among the companies that have already emblazoned their logos on new buildings along the road, or soon will be doing so, are  Andersen Consulting, British Telecom, Cable and Wireless, Nextlink, Nextel, Oracle, Sprint, Teleglobe Communications, Time Warner's Roadrunner unit and Winstar.</p>
        <p>Especially in demand are buildings along a six-mile stretch of the Dulles Toll Road  from Reston to the airport, where signs can be attached to buildings that are visible from the highway. About 129,000 vehicles, mostly driven by commuters, travel down the toll road each day, and last year nearly 20 million passengers used the airport. That figure represents a 25.8 percent increase from the previous year, making Dulles the fastest-growing airport in the world, the Airports Council International said.</p>
        <p>The federal government owns the airport and the 16-mile-long toll-free access highway leading to it. In 1984, the Commonwealth of Virginia opened a 12-mile four-lane toll road sandwiching the airport access highway, mostly for commuter use. It has twice been widened, so there are now four lanes in each direction on the outer edges of the access highway. The tolls range from 25 to 85 cents.</p>
        <p>''Many firms in the technology area are absolutely set on getting toll road visibility,'' said Raymond Ritchey, an executive vice president of Boston Properties, the developer that is erecting a number of office buildings in the Reston and Herndon, Va., area.  Typically, the companies are 3 to 10 years old and are seeking name recognition so that they can attract new employees and investors, he said.</p>
        <p>But visibility along the toll road doesn't come cheap: that location demands a 10 to 15 percent rent premium, he said.</p>
        <p>Annual rents in new buildings along the toll-road corridor range from $28 to $35 a square foot, including utilities, and are rising rapidly, said David Ross, the president of Atlantic Realty of Tysons Corner, Va., who together with Intertech of New York, is developing a 27-acre mixed-use site adjacent to Reston Town Center.</p>
        <p>Boston Properties is asking for annual rents as high as $44 a square foot for the top floor at 2 Freedom Square, a 16-story tower proposed for Reston Town Center and expected to be completed in early 2002. This compares with the $13 to $14 per square foot charged for prime space in Reston in 1993, Mr. Ross said.</p>
        <p>Reston is a 7,400-acre planned development, founded in 1961, 18 miles northwest of Washington in Fairfax County, Va. With a  population of about 55,000, it straddles the highways leading to Dulles airport five miles away. The town of Herndon is on the north side of the road between Reston and the airport. Reston has about 11.5 million square feet of office space, and Herndon about 6.1 million square feet, according to market data from Grubb &amp; Ellis, the real estate services company.</p>
        <p>With the opening of the toll road in 1984, office development exploded in the 1,000-acre strip of property zoned for commercial use on both sides of the highway in Reston. Demand for new space collapsed in the early 1990's and was not rekindled until 1996.</p>
        <p>CONTRIBUTING to the growth of Reston as an Internet center is the fact that it is crisscrossed by fiber-optic cable installed to serve national intelligence agencies and America Online, whose headquarters is just north of the airport. The Central Intelligence Agency leases two 130,000-square-foot buildings adjacent to  Reston Town Center, and the National Imagery and Mapping Agency leases a 400,000-square-foot building nearby.</p>
        <p>Many of the telecommunications companies in the Reston area are growing so fast that their management is hard-put to estimate what their space needs will be. To guard against running out of space, several have leased entire buildings and then have subleased the surplus space.</p>
        <p>Oracle Service Industries, the Oracle Corporation unit that specializes in data-management software for governments and  health-care and other companies, took another tack in dealing with future expansion.  It moved into its headquarters in a 210,000-square-foot, eight-story building on the toll road in October, but it bought the 24-acre site for $14 million back in 1996.</p>
        <p>In 1995, Oracle Service Industries, which was then headquartered just northwest of Washington in Bethesda, Md., had started to to look at possible sites in the Washington area that could accommodate projected growth. It decided that Reston offered the best combination of access, quality of life and proximity to its present and future work force.</p>
        <p>Oracle is now building the second parking garage on the site, which will serve a second office building that is expected to open in  November 2001. The site is zoned for a maximum of 725,000 square feet of office space.</p>
        <p>As technology companies cluster along the toll road, legal and investment services companies are following. Instead of leasing whole buildings, they are taking floors of premium space in Reston Town Center, the  80-acre mixed-use development that serves as the toll-road corridor's downtown.</p>
        <p>The center, which opened in 1990 and has a Hyatt hotel and upscale restaurants, is being developed by the Terrabrook unit of Westbrook Partners of New York. Boston Properties is Terrabrook's partner in building and leasing offices in the center, which  will be completed in 2004 if the current pace of construction continues.</p>
        <p>In the largest transaction last year in the corridor, Winstar Communications of New York signed a lease for three buildings with a total of 700,000 square feet being developed by Tishman Speyer in its 170-acre  Woodland Office Park along the toll road south of Herndon.</p>
        <p>America Online opened its offices in leased space along the toll road at Tysons Corner, about four miles east of Reston, in the early 1990's. In 1995, AOL purchased a 235,000-square-foot industrial building along the toll road and converted it to a computer center. After outgrowing the space, AOL moved to new headquarters it built along the extension of the toll road north of the airport in Loudoun County, Va.</p>
