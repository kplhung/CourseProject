        <p>As a retired English teacher I would like to commend Mr. Sanacore on his fine article ''Homeless Does Not Mean Helpless'' [Opinion, April 30]. Not only do educators have a responsibility to reach out to all children, but they also have a further responsibility to find as many ways as possible to help those children with special needs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sanacore supports my view by stating, ''The school's role, however, should not be construed as a condescending act of charity; instead, it should represent a genuine response to the learning needs of homeless students.'' I further agree with the author that the needs of these children must be met by a well planned strategy requiring a substantial effort by many people.</p>

        <p>As a retired English teacher I would like to commend Mr. Sanacore on his fine article ''Homeless Does Not Mean Helpless'' [Opinion, April 30].

        <p>Mr. Sanacore supports my view by stating, ''The school's role, however, should not be construed as a condescending act of charity; instead, it should represent a genuine response to the learning needs of homeless students.'' I further agree with the author that the needs of these children must be met by a well planned strategy requiring a substantial effort by many people.</p>
        <p>As a final point, parents must be coaxed slowly into the network of those working diligently to help their children. Parents should not be intimidated by the system, but should be made to feel that they are an integral part of the solution, which indeed they are. They must be helped to understand they and the educators involved are on the same side -- to help their children meet success.</p>
        <p>I think Mr. Sanacore summed it up well when he completed his article by stating, ''...the long-term benefits are substantial; more satisfying and productive lives for homeless students and their families.'' Isn't that what it's all about?</p>
