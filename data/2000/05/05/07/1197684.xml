        <p>Here, as in several parts of southern Turkey, water is rising inexorably around a doomed village as an artificial lake builds up behind a new dam, part of the government's ambitious plans to generate electric power and irrigate vast areas of dry land.</p>
        <p>But in Belkis, the swelling waters are not just disrupting lives or forever submerging long-cherished homes.</p>
        <p>In the last few months, archaeologists have found that an ancient city that once stood here holds what many experts are calling one of the world's richest collections of Roman mosaics. Much of it is about to disappear before anyone even has a chance to see it.</p>
        <p>''This is a real tragedy,'' said Mehmet Onal, the archaeologist who is supervising a frantic effort to rescue what can be saved before the site is inundated. ''We've only excavated two villas, and we found 12 beautiful mosaics. There are hundreds of villas under the earth, so you can imagine what remains to be found. The scale of what we have here is really unbelievable.''</p>
        <p>''If we can have four months, we can pass the Antakya Museum, and if we have two years we can pass the one in Tunis,'' Mr. Onal said. The museum in the Turkish city of Antakya, which was known in antiquity as Antioch, has this region's finest collection of ancient mosaics, and the one in Tunis is considered the finest in the world.</p>
        <p>The director of the government's energy and irrigation project in southern Turkey said he could not assess the cultural value of the site. The provincial governor said he was powerless to stop the inundation of what he called ''a second Pompeii.''</p>
        <p>If all proceeds according to plan, that leaves Mr. Onal and the handful of archaeologists working here with him only about a month before much of this site disappears. Every day they are excavating and removing artifacts, not just mosaics but others ranging from a five-foot-high bronze statue of Mars to 65,000 ceramic impressions of family and official seals, more than have ever been found at a single site.</p>
        <p>The mosaics, many of which depict scenes of Greek mythology, are being lifted and taken to a museum in the nearby provincial capital of Gaziantep. Two that have been uncovered in recent days are still in place. Both are magnificently preserved and compare in quality with those in great museums. One depicts Poseidon on his chariot along with the water deities Thetis and Oceanus. The other shows Perseus saving Andromeda from a sea monster. Each is the size of a mid-sized room.</p>
        <p>A few steps away from these two mosaics is an atrium covered with dirt and fragments of Roman columns. Archaeologists believe they will uncover another mosaic when they clear the debris in the next few days.</p>
        <p>The city that stood here 2,000 years ago, Zeugma, was at the eastern edge of the Roman Empire. It had an estimated 70,000 residents and was the base for a Roman legion. Its position on the banks of the Euphrates River, and its role as a thriving center of Silk Road trade, made it immensely wealthy.</p>
        <p>Rich traders competed with each other to decorate the floors of their villas with the most exquisite mosaics. In the third century, Zeugma is believed to have suffered an invasion, a devastating fire and an earthquake in quick succession. It has lain undisturbed since then, covered by thick layers of dirt and rubble.</p>
        <p>Archaeologists have worked sporadically here for several years but began concentrated excavation only last winter, after it became clear that the site was about to be lost. They say they are amazed at what they have found.</p>
        <p>''We knew we were looking at some fine work, but suddenly in these last couple of months we've realized that this is a major world-class site,'' said Christine Kondoleon, curator of Greek and Roman Art at the Worcester Art Museum in Massachusetts, who is visiting ancient ruins in Turkey this month.</p>
        <p>''Photos that have been coming out of there show that the mosaics are very rich, very elaborate and truly extraordinary,'' Ms. Kondoleon said. ''It would be a huge shame if we lose this site, especially if we never even see what's there. The whole thing is really upsetting because this is a great, great treasure.''</p>
        <p>Just down the dirt road from where archaeologists were digging, a farmer named Abdulrahma Kizilirmak, who had lived all of his 63 years in Belikis, sat stoically on a brick wall and watched as the village slowly disappeared. He has heard promises that he will get a fair price for the house he is losing, but doesn't believe them.</p>
        <p>''I'm so mad I'm about ready to pick up a gun,'' Mr. Kizilirmak said as he gazed out at a herd of cows grazing in a hillside cemetery that will soon be gone. ''We were comfortable and prosperous until the government came. Now even old stones are considered more important than we are. People are working to save the stones, but no one's doing anything for us.''</p>
        <p>The dam that stands just half a mile from the site is part of the multibillion-dollar Southeast Anatolia Project, which is a centerpiece of Turkey's development plans. Some of the dams envisioned by the project's planners, especially one that would lead to the flooding of the Kurdish town of Hasankeyf, 200 miles east of here on the Tigris River, have become the focus of international protest. Dams in places like Hasankeyf, however, are not yet built. The one here is complete. Most of its gates were shut on April 29 to begin the process of creating the artificial lake whose water will be used for power generation.</p>
        <p>The director of the massive project, Olcay Unver, an American-trained engineer, said in a telephone interview from his office in the capital, Ankara, that he was not familiar with details of the archaeological discoveries here.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately, all infrastructure projects are interventions with the physical system, and in some cases that does affect cultural or historic sites,'' Mr. Unver said. ''The bottom line is to put in a sincere effort to minimize loss. When that's not possible, you have to take precautions either to move what's there, or at least to establish a complete documentation of what is being lost.''</p>
        <p>The local governor, Muammar Guler, said he was powerless to stop the inundation, but added that less than half of the site would be flooded, and that he hoped the rest would be excavated and ultimately become an open-air museum. ''Besides, the dam only has a life span of 50 years,'' he said. ''So our grandchildren will be able to see the part that is being flooded this month.''</p>
        <p>Several of the mosaics that have recently been removed from Belkis are lying under tarpaulins in the front yard of the archaeological museum in Gaziantep. The museum's director, Hakki Alkan, said there were plans to build a new wing to house them, but he conceded that the government's apparently limited interest in classical art made the project uncertain.</p>
        <p>''We did everything we could to preserve the site, but no one was listening,'' Mr. Alkan said. ''The state has made its decision. Energy policy is more important than cultural and historical projects.''</p>
