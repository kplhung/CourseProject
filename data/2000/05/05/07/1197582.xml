        <p>SUDDENLY, the long-suffering supermarket sector seems an attractive place for investors to shop. Those seeking safety in a turbulent market have already begun to pile into what analysts perceive as the highest-quality supermarket stock, Safeway. Despite the pounding of retail stocks last week, its shares are up 20.3 percent so far this year; other grocery stocks have also shown gains of late.</p>
        <p>Money managers and analysts say some of these companies -- including Safeway -- may still be good bets, particularly for investors willing to take a longer-term approach.</p>
        <p>Last year, the Standard &amp; Poor's retail food chain stores index of five supermarket stocks fell 26 percent, versus a 20 percent gain in the S.&amp; P. 500, as investors fled value stocks in general and low-margin retailers in particular. This year has been a different story: the S.&amp; P. retail food chain index is up 5.3 percent, compared with a loss of 2.5 percent for the S.&amp; P. 500. But Lisa Cartwright, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, estimates that the group is still trading at a 40 percent discount to the S.&amp; P. 500, based on current price-to-earnings multiples.</p>
        <p>The chains themselves have joined the buying spree. Last month, the nation's two largest grocery chains, Kroger and Albertson's, announced plans to buy back $750 million and $500 million of their shares, respectively.</p>
        <p>The attraction in a time of tumult is obvious. In the past, grocery stocks have held up well during market downturns and recessions, so the stocks are seen as good defensive plays. The industry is likely to continue consolidating, many analysts say, creating greater economies of scale and fattening what have long been razor-thin net margins of 3 percent or less.</p>
        <p>''This sector has good earnings growth and it's trading at close to its 20-year lows in terms of valuation,'' said Mark Husson, an analyst at Merrill Lynch. ''Food retailing stocks are stable and solid. They have good earnings potential and the valuations are very cheap.''</p>
        <p>Of course, there are risks. If the stocks are to stay attractive, analysts say, earnings per share need to grow in the range of 16 to 18 percent -- a level last achieved in 1997.</p>
        <p>While many analysts expect some of the companies to reach that rate in 2000, they disagree on which ones will do so. Last year earnings per share for the five stocks grew just 14 percent, on average.</p>
        <p>Then there is the threat posed by Wal-Mart Stores, which has been rapidly pushing into the grocery business with its Supercenter outlets.  Wal-Mart Supercenters combine a large grocery store with the traditional Wal-Mart discounted general merchandise in vast stores of between 100,000 and 200,000 square feet. The company is introducing the Supercenters at a rapid pace: there were 739 as of March 31, compared with 582 a year earlier.</p>
        <p>Among the large chains, Kroger, of Cincinnati, faces the biggest risk from Wal-Mart because of geographical overlap: Wal-Mart operates Supercenters in about half of Kroger's 15 largest markets. So far, Kroger is holding its own, according to analysts. Indeed, Joseph A. Pichler, the chief executive, told analysts in a conference call two months ago that Kroger had increased its market share in five of the seven markets where it competes head-to-head with Wal-Mart.</p>
        <p>''What you're finding is that Wal-Mart is consolidating the business, but that Kroger is still able to compete effectively,'' said George Thompson, an analyst at Prudential Securities. Mr. Thompson said  Kroger should have no problem achieving earnings-per-share growth in the 16 to 18 percent range going forward.</p>
        <p>He has a strong buy on the stock and a 52-week price target of $32; the shares now trade at $19.5625, or 14.5 times analysts' 2000 earnings estimate of $1.35 a share.</p>
        <p>MASU MULLICK, co-manager of the Neuberger Berman Partners fund, says Kroger presents an interesting risk-reward story because of its $13.5 billion acquisition last May of Fred Meyer, a supermarket chain based in Portland, Ore., that nearly doubled Kroger's size.</p>
        <p>''It's a combination of a terrific opportunity and a terrific challenge,'' said Mr. Mullick, who had about 2.5 percent of the fund invested in Kroger on March 31.</p>
        <p>Others say the merger has made it more difficult for Kroger to focus on its Internet strategy. Though Internet grocers are struggling to turn profits, some analysts worry that traditional brick-and-mortar chains will eventually feel some impact.</p>
        <p>Over the last month, Safeway has invested in Groceryworks.com, an online grocer in Dallas, while Royal Ahold, the Netherlands-based operator of Stop &amp; Shop and Giant Food Stores, has invested in another, Peapod of Skokie, Ill.</p>
        <p>''The Internet is clearly going to be a channel, even if the model has not yet been figured out,'' Ms. Cartwright said. ''But it's important to have a strategy.''</p>
        <p>DESPITE the run-up in Safeway's stock, it remains the favorite of some analysts, largely because the company has avoided the big acquisitions that Kroger and Albertson's have made.</p>
        <p>Safeway, which is based in Pleasanton, Calif., and operates more than 1,600 stores, is often cited as having a strong management team.</p>
        <p>''They don't have have the integration risk that Kroger has'' as a result of its merger, said Deborah Weinswig, an analyst at Bear Stearns. Her  52-week price target for the stock is $65; the shares closed on Friday at  $43, or 19 times analysts' earnings estimates of $2.23 a share for this year.</p>
        <p>For its part, Albertson's, based in Boise, Idaho, is not encountering major problems in its merger with American Stores, completed last June, but analysts said it still has to prove that it can handle increased competition from Wal-Mart.</p>
        <p>Ms. Cartwright has a hold on the stock and a 12-month price target of $35. It now trades at $32.1875, or 12  times analysts' 2000 earnings estimates of $2.68 a share.</p>
