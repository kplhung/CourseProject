      <block class="full_text">
        <p>REAL estate agents routinely place ads urging homeowners to capitalize on the hot market and sell their home quickly.</p>
        <p>But one agent recently took out a full-page advertisement in a local weekly directing sellers to do virtually the opposite: to take time before selling their homes and to make sure their listing was shared with competing realtors before accepting an offer.</p>
        <p>Placed by Ralph Ragette, who owns Prudential Ragette Realtors, the ad in The Rivertown Enterprise warned sellers to avoid brokers who do not immediately put properties on the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service, which updates local agents daily about new properties on the market.</p>
        <p>By withholding listings, he argued, agents can avoid splitting their commissions with other agents, but sellers can lose out on competing offers and, potentially, a higher selling price.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ragette and many other Westchester agents say that today's brisk market is causing more and more breaches in a longstanding agreement among brokers to share new listings.</p>
        <p>''There are properties everybody knows are for sale that are mysteriously not put on the listings for days,'' he said. ''You call the broker and they don't call back. Suddenly, you find out it's sold.''</p>
        <p>In the ad, Mr. Ragette urged sellers to deal only with a broker who will provide proof that the property has been listed within 24 hours of the agreement. He also urged sellers to hold at least one open house for brokers and wait at least one week before accepting an offer.</p>
        <p>Withholding clients' homes from the multiple listings service, Mr. Ragette said, ''strikes at the very heart of our business.'' He spent $850 on the advertisement, he said, and will place others to educate buyers and sellers about the unscrupulous tactics of some agents.</p>
        <p>But Jackson B. Browning, president of the Julia B. Fee real estate company, which runs four Westchester offices, played down complaints like Mr. Ragette's, attributing them not to brokers' greed for commissions but to the way brokers have adapted to the current state of the industry.</p>
        <p>''The market is so hot, so fast paced, it's not unusual to have the property sold in less than 24 hours, even before it is listed on M.L.S.,'' he said. ''You get a call from a seller asking, 'Can you price my property?' '' Mr. Browning said. ''Right away, you may call a customer, and it may be sold even before you've signed and listed it.''</p>
        <p>The commission on a sale of a house, typically 5 or 6 percent of the selling price, is usually split equally between the agent who lists a property for sale and the one who finds a buyer. The first broker can make the total commission if he finds the buyer, which, of course, is less likely when the property is listed with other brokers.</p>
        <p>Most brokers are members of the Westchester County Board of Realtors and subscribe to the Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service, which is owned and operated by the Westchester board and the Putnam County Association of Realtors.</p>
        <p>According to the board's rules, a broker must list a property within 24 hours of signing a contract to sell it. But often, Mr. Ragette said, a broker can delay listing it by getting a client to post-date the contract, with the broker promising to provide buyers himself or saying the home needs some sprucing up. In the interim, the broker sells the property before listing it.</p>
        <p>''With a very busy market the temptation is there to keep a property off the M.L.S. to see if you can sell it yourself,'' said P. Gilbert Mercurio, the board's executive vice president, who characterized the recent rise in complaints as not quite an epidemic but ''certainly a low-grade fever.''</p>
        <p>He added, '''It's almost always in the client's best interest to have their home widely exposed to a maximum number of brokers and potential buyers by listing with the M.L.S.''</p>
        <p>A broker who fails to list new clients promptly can draw penalties ranging from a reprimand to a $5,000 fine and expulsion from the association, Mr. Mercurio said, but detection and enforcement is difficult.</p>
        <p>The state can also punish offenders, said Scott Trent, a spokesman for the New York Department of State, the agency that licenses real estate brokers. Its Division of Licensing Services oversees real estate professionals. Failing to list a client's property without their consent, while not a criminal violation, can result in fines and even suspension or revocation of a broker's license.</p>
        <p>Many brokers say they often suspect foul play with listings that suspiciously appear the same day the house is sold.</p>
        <p>Walter Davis, an agent at the Coldwell-Banker office in Bedford said that last December he saw an M.L.S. listing for a 10-room colonial from the 1840's on a four-acre plot in Bedford selling for $560,000. Mr. Davis had an eager buyer who was interested in the house, he said.</p>
        <p>''I called to preview it, only to be told it was already sold,'' he recalled. ''I checked and it was reported as sold by the same company that listed it, and the title passed on the same day it was listed.''</p>
        <p>Many attribute the rise in complaints partly to market conditions. The Westchester-Putnam Multiple Listing Service has gone from carrying roughly 25,000 new listings annually in years past, to about 15,000 last year.</p>
        <p>With more buyers clamoring for fewer homes, brokers can sell properties sometimes within a day of being retained by the seller.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot fewer available properties out there,'' said James W. Hughes, dean of the School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, ''so these listings become like gold, and brokers don't want to give them up.''</p>
