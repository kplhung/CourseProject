        <p>A BOHEMIAN BRIGADE</p>
        <p>The Civil War Correspondents</p>
        <p>-- Mostly Rough,</p>
        <p>Sometimes Ready.</p>
        <p>By James M. Perry.</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 305 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>John Wiley &amp; Sons. $27.95.</p>
        <p>''The modern American journalist emerged for the first time in the Civil War,'' James M. Perry writes of the men (and they were all men, and all but one white) who covered this country's most terrible war. ''It was the world's original instant-news war, made possible by the telegraph -- the 'lightning,' they called it -- a tremendous breakthrough in communications technology.''</p>
        <p>Despite this claim, neither technology nor the standards of objectivity we today take for granted in news gathering play much of a part in the story Perry has to tell in ''A Bohemian Brigade.'' Neither the Union nor the Confederacy recognized correspondents as noncombatants, and in many cases they were not. At the Battle of Bull Run, Edmund Clarence Stedmen of The New York World picked up the colors of the Fifth Massachusetts Regiment and tried to rally the troops. Some reporters, like Junius Henri Browne, representing Horace Greeley's New York Tribune, took potshots at rebel snipers. Some profited in cotton futures, some eavesdropped on generals' conversations; all, Perry writes, ''rogues and heroes alike,'' were biased.</p>
        <p>When captured, they were treated as spies -- often by their own side as well. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman in particular loathed reporters. At Vicksburg, Sherman had Thomas W. Knox of The New York Herald, who had criticized him for bungling the early stages of the campaign, court-martialed for giving information to the enemy. Knox was acquitted, but The Philadelphia Inquirer's Edward Crapsey, who implied that Gen. George Meade showed timidity in pursuing Gen. Robert E. Lee after Gettysburg, was tied to a mule and paraded through the ranks with the sign ''Libeler of the Press'' hung on his back.</p>
        <p>Perry, who writes about national politics for The Wall Street Journal, tells mainly the story of Northern reporters. More than a score of these published memoirs after the war, while no Southern correspondents did, and few issues of Southern newspapers have survived. Faced with shortages of paper, type and, especially, typesetters, Southern reporting had to be kept brief. One paper, however, The Memphis Appeal, nicknamed The Moving Appeal, published every day for three years on the run from advancing Yankees and was admired for being ''free from vituperation,'' calling the president ''Mr. Lincoln'' rather than ''the Illinois Baboon.''</p>
        <p>With most of the telegraph lines under military control, many reporters preferred to file their stories in person -- demonstrating an alacrity and persistence one would like to think is their true legacy to American journalism. Their stories were letters or dispatches, lengthy, frankly personal and rarely following the tidy who-what-where-when formula. ''But it would never have occurred to Civil War newspaper readers to complain about the pace of these dispatches,'' Perry writes. ''They were devoured, word for word, and handed from one eager hand to another; the more detail the better.''</p>
        <p>The story Perry tells is not of the adventures of some jolly, rousting band; except for a few brief mentions, there is not much about the Bohemian Brigade (a name some correspondents gave themselves early in the war in the Western campaign, where they all were assigned the same Room 45 of a certain Cairo, Ill., hotel) or how current the name was -- the one conspicuous omission in an otherwise engrossing and satisfying narrative. Like the war itself, this is a story of remarkable personal drama: Sylvanus Cadwallader of The Chicago Times rescuing Gen. Ulysses S. Grant from his worst drinking binge of the war by locking them both in the general's stateroom and pouring out all his whiskey; The New York Times's Samuel Wilkeson, in one of the war's most indelible images, writing his dispatch from the Gettysburg battlefield beside the open grave of his oldest son, an artillery officer; and Thomas Morris Chester of The Philadelphia Press, the only known black reporter for a metropolitan daily, writing from the speaker's chair of the Richmond Hall of Congress.</p>
