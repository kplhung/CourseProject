        <p>The traffic is already thickening in this tiny old town, and by the end of the month the weekends will deliver thousands of Philadelphians from the Route 55 freeway to the traffic jam snaking up Route 47 from the shore. The backup starts here, in Cumberland County.</p>
        <p>While the beaches boom, South Jersey political leaders are trying to raise from the dead a plan that environmentalists find all but incredible: the extension of Route 55 through the marshy plains between Port Elizabeth and the Garden State Parkway.</p>
        <p>''Where 47 comes down it's horrendous,'' said State Senator James S. Cafiero, Republican of North Wildwood. ''People can't back out of their driveways.''</p>
        <p>Three months ago, the Senate passed a nonbinding resolution urging the state Department of Transportation, which had turned aside the proposal for decades, to complete the highway. Shortly afterward, the board of the South Jersey Transportation Planning Organization, the agency charged with reviewing projects in the region, endorsed the Senate resolution.</p>
        <p>Environmental advocates are fighting back. They maintain that a 20-mile freeway would destroy some of the state's most ecologically fragile land and mar the beauty that draws tourists, all in the cause of easing congestion that lasts perhaps 300 hours a year.</p>
        <p>''This summer we'll be proactive, while we have this audience of three-quarters of a million people,'' said Douglas Jewell, a real estate broker in Swainton who is a leader of Concerned Citizens of Cape May County, an environmental group.</p>
        <p>The proposal is also opposed by the Sierra Club, the New Jersey Audubon Society and other groups that say it would undermine the anti-sprawl objectives of the State Development and Redevelopment Plan.</p>
        <p>Jeff Tittel, president of the New Jersey chapter of the Sierra Club, said he was skeptical of the Whitman Administration's assurances that the state has no plans to extend Route 55. Mr. Tittel cited several highway projects that had appeared suddenly on the Department of Transportations project list.</p>
        <p>''If it gets political momentum, the next thing you know, it's getting approval,'' Mr. Tittel said.</p>
        <p>James Weinstein, the state transportation commissioner, acknowledged that the Senate resolution was ''absolutely'' significant. ''When a project has the support of the Legislature,'' he said, ''it raises it to a different level.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Weinstein said the department had no plan beyond improving existing roads. ''The reality is that the environmental challenges are substantial,'' Mr. Weinstein said.</p>
        <p>A feasibility study in 1993 mapped out a likely route for the new road but did not endorse the project, in part because 40 percent of the highway would cross wetlands. The study then placed the cost at $423 million to $483 million -- a price tag that environmental advocates say would now approach $1 billion.</p>
        <p>Still, both sides regard the renewed call to extend the highway as a test of the administration's resolve.</p>
        <p>The Senate resolution ''should not have an effect on a governor committed to smart growth and the state plan,'' said Bill Neil, the director of conservation for the New Jersey Audubon Society.</p>
        <p>But Senator Cafiero, who sponsored the resolution, along with the Senate president, Donald T. DiFrancesco, said it expressed the legislature's frustration with decades of delay. ''I came to the legislature in 1968, and that project was on the board then,'' Senator Cafiero said. ''It becomes more costly as time goes on. If enough pressure can be brought to bear, whatever plans they have can be diverted or amended a little bit.''</p>
        <p>The environmental obstacles are huge. Half of the new road would lie within the pinelands. It would need approval from the Pinelands Commission, which has already registered its reservations, the Army Corps of Engineers and state and federal environmental agencies.</p>
        <p>Those problems were cited in a 1998 report by the South Jersey Transportation Planning Organization, which evaluated many alternatives for alleviating shore traffic both from the Garden State Parkway and Route 55, which begins in Gloucester County. The report concluded that the project ''would face extreme environmental problems'' and ''would also be very costly.''</p>
        <p>But now, said Timothy G. Chelius, the agency's director, the project ''is at the top of this organization's list.''</p>
        <p>The Route 55 plan is just one thread in a larger debate over economic development in the southern counties.</p>
        <p>''To the power brokers there, they are an underdeveloped area that wants what the rest of the state has,'' Mr. Neil said.</p>
        <p>Senator Cafiero agrees. ''You can't expect us to keep all these open fields and green spaces while depriving us of the ratables that reasonable construction would allow,'' he said. ''We can't be the windows on the world.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jewell said that elected officials were responding to development interests, which contribute heavily to their campaigns, and that the vast majority of residents opposed further building in the county.</p>
        <p>''We just want to preserve a way of life,'' he said. ''If we want to be Atlantic County or Asbury Park, we can do that, too.''</p>
        <p>But some residents do support an extended Route 55. ''There are a sizable number of people in South Jersey who are opposed, for want of a better phrase, to anything happening,'' said Brian Reynolds, a year-round Avalon resident.</p>
        <p>Mr. Reynolds, who wrote to the transportation planning organization on behalf of a homeowners group, said in an interview that ''on Route 55 on a summer Saturday morning you could have a backup four or five miles long before you get to 47.''</p>
        <p>Another concern, he said, was evacuating the islands in the event of a hurricane threat, particularly since parts of Route 47 are susceptible to flooding.</p>
        <p>On Route 47, Yvonne Glauner, who runs Two Pines Country Gifts in a shop behind her parents' farmhouse, said most people considered the traffic a nuisance, but not one to be solved by a new four-lane highway. ''To do all that and disrupt the wildlife and people's homes for three months of the year doesn't make sense,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Glauner said it would not matter much to her business if shore-bound traffic was diverted. In the bumper-to-bumper stream on Friday nights and Saturdays, she said, few pull off for gift shopping.</p>
