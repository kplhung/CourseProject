        <p>SINCE ''sport utility vehicle'' entered the vocabulary, the taxonomists of the auto business have been pulling out their wiry hair trying to keep up with the diversity of the four-wheeled kingdom. Should one, for instance, accept BMW's classification of its X5 as a ''sports activity vehicle''? Is that different from an ''all activity vehicle,'' which is what Mercedes-Benz calls its M-Class?</p>
        <p>Can we likewise tolerate the rising currency of the ''sport utility truck,'' or S.U.T., neologism, or should we opt for the descriptive but indefensibly clumsy ''four-door light-duty pickup'' or ''truck-sedan''? Whatever term comes of age, it had better grow up quick, since five- and six-passenger pickups with four sedan-style doors and short cargo beds are barging into the market like an enraged SWAT team.</p>
        <p>Nissan's Frontier Crew Cab was the first to arrive, in 1999, followed by the Dodge Dakota Quad Cab. More recently, Ford began to sell its F-150 SuperCrew and Explorer Sport Trac, a variant of its popular midsize S.U.V. with an open-air cargo bed behind the rear seat. Toyota will soon throw its Tacoma Double Cab into the ring; coming later this year are crew-cab versions of the Chevy S-10 and GMC Sonoma.</p>
        <p>This is only the first wave. Waiting in the wings are the Subaru ST/X (small), Chevy Avalanche (large) and Lincoln Blackwood (extra-large), not to mention Cadillac's yet-unnamed riff on the theme.</p>
        <p>By anyone's reckoning, that's a trend. The president of Ford Division, James G. O'Connor, was only half-kidding in describing the strategy as ''when in doubt, add doors.''</p>
        <p>How did four-door trucks become the cat's pajamas? Since the early 1970's, heavy-duty pickup trucks (weighing more than 8,500 pounds when loaded) have been available with four sedan-style doors. These six-passenger ''crew cab'' vehicles were and are intended to carry construction crews and their tools to job sites.</p>
        <p>While these vehicles were versatile, they were also unwieldy, said J. D. Julow, vice president of the Dodge Division of DaimlerChrysler. ''The retail customer found that size too tall, too long, too difficult to park.''</p>
        <p>Since the early 1990's, manufacturers have offered extended-cab versions of pickups with three and four doors in an attempt to bring more convenience to the pickup cab. These cab-plus configurations (with a small bench or jump seats in back, plus rear ''suicide doors'' hinged at the back) now dominate the market. In 1996, for instance, 30 percent of Ford F-150's had extended SuperCabs; now, SuperCabs represent more than 70 percent of F-150 production.</p>
        <p>Pushing from the other direction was the distinct lack of utility in sport utilities. Mr. Jurow said that many S.U.V. owners were being driven into pickups by the ''occasional use imperative'' -- that is, the infrequent instances when they really needed a truck for home projects like hauling mulch or moving furniture, chores that utilities don't handle well. But pickup cabs, even extended cabs, cannot manage passengers well. ''We think we've solved that problem,'' Mr. Jurow said.</p>
        <p>The new breed of four-door trucks ''provide convenience and room for a family of four or five day-to-day,'' Mr. Jurow said, ''yet gives you the occasional convenience of payload and hauling things that are not going to fit in a standard car.''</p>
        <p>Typically, these vehicles are based on standard truck platforms, with extended wheelbases to accommodate the longer cabs. To avoid excessive length, the cargo beds are shorter than a standard pickup's. The Quad Cab's cargo bed, for instance, is 63.1 inches (5.3 feet) compared with the regular-cab's bed length of 77.9 inches (6.5 feet). The Frontier Crew Cab is only 8.8 inches longer than Nissan's standard truck.</p>
        <p>For domestic brands, the crew cab configuration was an easy choice. Development costs of such models, which are simply variations on existing platforms, are thin, and profit margins are fat. For example, the Ford F-150 SuperCrew XLT two-wheel drive has a base price of $26,755, a whopping $7,000 over the base price of a regular F-150.</p>
        <p>''The market is going to demand differentiation among products,'' said Mr. O'Connor of Ford. ''Our business demands economies of scale. The winner will be the company who can take a flexible platform and derive multiple vehicle entries from it.''</p>
        <p>For foreign nameplates, the decision was even easier. Nissan and Toyota already sell popular four-door pickups in other parts of the world, where they do double duty as vehicles for family and work. Mitsubishi, too, has the Strada four-door truck based on the Montero Sport platform. Company officials say it is likely that the next-generation Montero Sport, to be built at the company's plant in Normal, Ill., will foster a Strada for the American market.</p>
        <p>There is still the thorny issue of what to call these vehicles. Morphologically they are pickups, but the lonesome-cowboy image doesn't seem to apply to vehicles that carry five or six in comfort. What about the widely used ''crossover''?</p>
        <p>''If this is a truck and that's a car, eventually most of the market will be a crossover,'' Mr. Jurow said. ''Because the consumer is not going to compromise needs just so vehicles fit into one neat category or another.''</p>
