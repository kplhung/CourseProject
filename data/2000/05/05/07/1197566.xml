        <p>Cicily Wilson and Gregory John Speller were married yesterday by Richard Gilligan, a Roman Catholic deacon, at St. Mary Gate of Heaven Church in South Ozone Park, Queens.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wilson, 27, will keep her name. She is a daughter of Karen Wilson and Bill Sims of Flushing, Queens. The bride, her parents and her sister, Chaney Sims, were the subjects of ''An American Love Story,'' a 1999 PBS documentary that examined their experiences as a biracial family.</p>
        <p>Her mother is a human resources manager at the ContiGroup Companies, an agricultural services concern based in Manhattan. Her father, a blues guitarist, leads the American Acoustic Roots Orchestra.</p>
        <p>The bride is in charge of fund-raising and public relations at the Brooklyn-Queens Conservatory of Music, a nonprofit community school in Flushing. She received a bachelor's degree in religion from Colgate University.</p>
        <p>Mr. Speller, 34, is a son of Judith Pelson Speller and Dennis J. Speller of Williamsville, N.Y. His mother is a librarian and his father is a lawyer, both in Buffalo.</p>
        <p>The bridegroom is an organizer in New York for Local 1199 of the Health and Human Services Union. He received a bachelor's degree in political science and history from St. Lawrence University and a master's degree in political science from Columbia.</p>
        <p>The couple met on a blind date in May 1997. Ms. Wilson's family has a test for her dates: prospective suitors have to know the blues, or they're out. Saying B. B. King is your favorite artist isn't enough. ''Too mainstream,'' Ms. Wilson said. To her astonishment and delight, the unsuspecting Mr. Speller said he had a long list of favorite blues artists, starting with Sonny Boy Williamson, a guitarist and harmonica player whose songs were covered by the Allman Brothers and others. ''The date went excellent,'' Ms. Wilson said.</p>
        <p>The two became inseparable. By May 1999, Mr. Speller was eager to propose, and he did so in an elaborate ruse. Ms. Wilson's father said he needed her to sing backup on his next compact disk and asked her to meet him at the Terra Blues club on Bleecker Street in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Speller accompanied her to the club and casually offered her a box of Cracker Jack, which contained the engagement ring. But Ms. Wilson said that she was nervous about her voice, that she really wasn't a very skilled singer and that the last thing she needed was a kernel of candied popcorn stuck in her throat. Alarmed, Mr. Speller offered her the Cracker Jack twice more. Twice more, she refused.</p>
        <p>Finally, Mr. Speller took out the ring and put it in her hand. Feeling it, Ms. Wilson thought: ''Wow! Cracker Jack prizes are getting better these days.'' Her father played a musical cue, and the couple's families poured in from the back of the club. From the corner of her eye, she could see Mr. Speller sink to one knee to ask her to marry him. As friends and family converged, waiting for her reply, Ms. Wilson said, dazed, ''Does this mean I don't have to sing?''</p>
