      <abstract>
        <p>Competition &amp; Sports Cars Ltd in Greenwich, Conn, is constructing $25 million BMW dealership; building is expected to be completed in spring of 2001; owner Andrew Feuerstein comments; drawing (M)</p>

        <p>It is probably safe to say that visitors to automobile dealerships are thinking more about sticker prices and the cars' features than about the building's architectural features. But even people who have no intention of buying a BMW at Competition &amp; Sports Cars Ltd. in Greenwich, Conn., may be stopping by for a look -- a look at the building.</p>
        <p>One thing that will be distinctive about it is that it will be that rare dealership with no cars on display outside after business hours. Instead, new cars will be displayed in the 18-foot-high showroom and cars in inventory will be stored below ground, while cars to be serviced will be dropped off at a reception pavilion and driven to the service department or parking level, both of them also underground.</p>

        <p>It is probably safe to say that visitors to automobile dealerships are thinking more about sticker prices and the cars' features than about the building's architectural features. But even people who have no intention of buying a BMW at Competition &amp; Sports Cars Ltd. in Greenwich, Conn., may be stopping by for a look -- a look at the building.</p>
        <p>One thing that will be distinctive about it is that it will be that rare dealership with no cars on display outside after business hours. Instead, new cars will be displayed in the 18-foot-high showroom and cars in inventory will be stored below ground, while cars to be serviced will be dropped off at a reception pavilion and driven to the service department or parking level, both of them also underground.</p>
        <p>The showroom and service pavilion will be joined at the waiting area, which will include a coffee bar and a shop selling BMW memorabilia.</p>
        <p>The building's separate sales and service entrances will be linked by a 398-foot-long wall made of natural Fairfield granite from the surrounding area. Ascending from 8 to 39 feet in height, the wall is intended as the spine of the entire structure, anchoring the building to the site, said Marc B. Spector, the lead designer for the project and a principal of the Spector Group, the Long Island architectural and design firm.</p>
        <p>The owner of Competition &amp; Sports Cars is Andrew Feuerstein, who has been a BMW dealer in Greenwich for almost 30 years and will move to the new site when the building is completed, in the spring of 2001.</p>
        <p>Mr. Feuerstein interviewed a number of architects for the project, which will cost upward of $25 million. But he chose Mr. Spector, he said, because they shared much the same vision.</p>
        <p>That vision was of a dealership that was architecturally distinct, he added, ''not that same rectangular structure with rows of cars parked outside.''</p>
        <p>This dealership will be a far cry from that. For example, the design for the service reception pavilion was inspired by the BMW hood grill, Mr. Spector said, the entrance doors are an abstract image of the grill and the entire area is intended to suggest the internal workings of the car.</p>
        <p>Mr. Feuerstein also wanted a clean, well-lighted service area, to avoid consigning those customers to ''the most unattractive part of the building in the most inconvenient space.''</p>
        <p>That attitude, Mr. Feuerstein added, and not just in a dealership where cars cost between $32,000 and $140,000, amounts to saying, ''We've got your money, now you're on your own.''</p>
