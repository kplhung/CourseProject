        <p>OTHER families, those with more money and less imagination, use their children's spring breaks to go to Europe, Disney World or at least the Amish country.</p>
        <p>We have themes. For Spring Vacation 2000, the theme was Margot's science fair project, the invention of radio.</p>
        <p>The plans were fairly humble. Margot was going to build a crystal radio set out of an oatmeal container, with help from her dad. The project was inspired by the fact that they both like to listen to old radio shows. I, in fact, may be the only mother in the past 50 years who has actually yelled, ''Turn down the Jack Benny!''</p>
        <p>As science projects go, ours was simple. Crystal sets are such a common do-it-yourself activity that Radio Shack sells them for $10, although my husband insisted we build ours from scratch. (We'd already promised product placement to Quaker Oats.)</p>
        <p>We had five solid days of spring vacation yawning like a vast expanse of geological time, with no travel plans and my husband off from work. There wasn't just time to build a crystal set; we could have built a radio tower. We could have found a new way to broadcast radio, besides AM and FM and shortwave, and become multimillionaires. We could have built a holographic model of radio waves, with a four-foot papier-mache representation of the human ear. Heck, we could have exhumed Marconi and done a DNA analysis on his remains.</p>
        <p>Instead, we found ourselves doing what we do best, listening to old radio. We pulled out a tape of Orson Welles's famous ''War of the Worlds'' broadcast of 1938, and -- because we are romantics rather than scientists -- drove to Grover's Mill, where the Martians supposedly landed.</p>
        <p>Leave it to writers to turn science into science fiction.</p>
        <p>There, next to Grover's Mill pond, is a sculpture dedicated to the radio broadcast, where we were met by Douglas Forrester, who has done more than anyone in New Jersey to commemorate the famous radio event -- including raising money to build the sculpture and planning 50th and 60th anniversary celebrations. He even bears an uncanny resemblance to Orson Welles.</p>
        <p>Mr. Forrester related that townspeople there have long been bothered by the whole thing. ''There is the residual issue of being the butt of a national joke,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Forrester sees it differently. ''It's an interesting piece of Americana, a landmark in broadcast history,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the weather turned unseasonably chilly that afternoon, and Noah, after indulging our little historical tour for two minutes, went back to the van to play Game Boy. Margot politely listened for five minutes more before her retreat.</p>
        <p>But my husband and I, though shivering, were held rapt by Mr. Forrrester's stories about the 50th anniversary celebration, including Garrison Keillor's criticism of the Welles broadcast at an event honoring Howard Koch, who wrote the radio play.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Forrester left, we insisted that Margot get out of the car and pose for a photograph next to the ''War of the Worlds'' sculpture. ''But nothing ever happened here!'' she protested. Just like a scientist.</p>
        <p>We did all kinds of other things that week in the name of science, including a visit to the Museum of Television and Radio in New York (where we saw an episode of ''I Love Lucy,'' featuring Orson Welles). And we saw the Bergen County Players perform the musical ''1940's Radio Hour.''</p>
        <p>I also talked to John Feldman of the Center for Improved Engineering and Science Education at the Stevens Institute in Hoboken, which helps schools teach science better. We discussed the surprising results of last year's fourth-grade proficiency tests, in which children did better in science than in language arts. Dr. Feldman, who once taught physics, thinks science got a boost from the state's core curriculum, which inspired primary schools to develop more hands-on science projects. He also pronounced our family's science-theme week ''interesting,'' which I know from seeing the Broadway play ''Copenhagen,'' is physicist for ''stupid.''</p>
        <p>But Dr. Feldman wistfully remembered building his own crystal set years ago. ''When it actually works and you hear something, it's amazing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Indeed it was. Margot even kept a log worthy of Marconi: ''April 27, 2000. We hear faint sound if listening closely . . . Attempting to make sound clearer and louder 12:51 p.m. . . . Success! . . . 12:59 p.m. . . . Now we can hear Vicky Carr 'It Must Be Him.' ''</p>
        <p>Not just radio. A time machine.</p>
