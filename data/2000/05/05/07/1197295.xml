        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In his review of ''American Dreamer: The Life and Times of Henry A. Wallace'' (April 16), Nelson Lichtenstein rightly praises the authors, John C. Culver and John Hyde, for providing an ''expansive and engaging biography,'' restoring Wallace to his rightful place at ''the animating center of American politics during the heyday of the New Deal.''</p>
        <p>Yet Lichtenstein's review fails to convey how Culver and Hyde's history challenges the traditional narrative about Wallace's 1948 run on the Progressive Party ticket. While Lichtenstein repeats the well-worn canard that Wallace's Progressive Party was little more than a front for the Communist Party, Culver and Hyde point to the democratic aspirations that the Wallace campaign represented. Indeed, their chapter on Wallace's bold challenge to racial segregation in the South in 1948 illustrates how the Progressive Party effort supported the emerging Southern civil rights movement at a very fundamental level. During the 1940's, Wallace was one of the few national political figures to become actively engaged in the black protests that were accelerating under the aegis of organizations like the N.A.A.C.P., the Southern Negro Youth Congress and local civil rights groups throughout the nation.</p>
        <p>It is time for historians at ''the table of New Deal remembrance,'' as Lichtenstein calls it, to give serious attention to the broader democratic struggles that shaped the possibilities of the New Deal era and beyond. ''American Dreamer'' is a welcome step in that direction.</p>
