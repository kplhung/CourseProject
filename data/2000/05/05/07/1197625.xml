        <p>In that Disney opposes Time Warner's planned merger with America Online, Steve Case, AOL's chairman, had an interest in events leading to ABC stations' being blocked from 3.5 million homes. ''It's not really about retransmission rights'' but about Disney's and Time Warner's broader dealings, he said Monday night, shortly before a Columbia Business School fundraising dinner. ''Luckily, it's not my problem yet.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Case, looking uncharacteristically uncasual in a tuxedo, was invited to receive the school's Millennium Award by Compaq's chairman, Benjamin M. Rosen, a 1961 graduate.
