        <p>BLOND is bold and beautiful with red teardrop lanterns hanging in the windows, pale wood floors, large canvases of earth-toned paintings and a white tablecloth and candlelit ambience. Although it is sophisticated enough to be at home in the Hamptons, the restaurant is in the Aliano Shopping Center on Route 25A in Miller Place.</p>
        <p>When we wondered aloud about the name of this restaurant, an attractive blond woman at the next table walked over and confided: ''It's named for me. I'm their mother.'' She was referring to Anthony and Craig Scali, the owners. Anthony Scali is an experienced restaurateur who was formerly a partner at La Plage in Wading River, another glamorous place in an unlikely locale.</p>

        <p>BLOND is bold and beautiful with red teardrop lanterns hanging in the windows, pale wood floors, large canvases of earth-toned paintings and a white tablecloth and candlelit ambience. Although it is sophisticated enough to be at home in the Hamptons, the restaurant is in the Aliano Shopping Center on Route 25A in Miller Place.</p>
        <p>When we wondered aloud about the name of this restaurant, an attractive blond woman at the next table walked over and confided: ''It's named for me. I'm their mother.'' She was referring to Anthony and Craig Scali, the owners. Anthony Scali is an experienced restaurateur who was formerly a partner at La Plage in Wading River, another glamorous place in an unlikely locale.</p>
        <p>The executive chef at Blond is Michael Scelfo, a young man who trained at the Western Culinary Institute in Oregon and, since his trek east, has worked at La Plage and 75 Main in Southampton. He specializes in vibrantly seasoned food. Take the marinated hanger steak and grilled asparagus. Both were fine, but it was the warm Yukon gold potato and Gorgonzola salad that jumped off the plate. The same can be said of the lightly sauteed, pleasantly chewy mustard-chive spatzle that shared the plate with grilled pork tenderloin, apple sauce and root vegetables flavored with sage.</p>
        <p>A transplanted Southerner at our table was transported by the cheese-and-apple grits and Low Country vinaigrette that accompanied pieces of juicy grilled chicken. A sprinkling of crispy bacon added another flavor punch.</p>
        <p>One evening, tender braised beef short ribs perched on a stage of horseradish-touched mashed potatoes brought cheers. So did slices of duck breast paired with a terrific creamy risotto of duck confit, white truffle oil and wild mushrooms. Another risotto that scored highlighted smoked chicken, peas, goat cheese, wild mushrooms and crisp pancetta.  The fussy manicotti filled with cheeses, slices of smoky portobellos and asparagus wrapped in prosciutto was an also-ran.</p>
        <p>Start the meal with what the menu calls ''a simple green salad.'' A mound of fluffy greens is set upon slices of summer-quality red and yellow tomatoes with Gorgonzola toasts ringing the plate. There are three other worthy salads on that menuy:  frisee with bacon, apples, hazelnuts and smoked cheddar; a Caesar-like creation with romaine and crisp pancetta; and a pear-prosciutto number featuring a thin slice of ham topped with julienned strips of pear and Parmesan, drizzled with chive oil.  Salad is also at the heart of the very pleasing grilled corn and crab cake offering.</p>
        <p>On a cool spring evening, a smooth Yukon gold potato soup with Gruyere cheese croutons and sage oil hit the spot. So did an unusual chewy-crusted pizza topped with creamy mascarpone, white truffle oil, grilled asparagus and shaved Yukon gold potatoes (the last ingredient was not discernible, though). A combination of littleneck clams and spicy lamb sausage in a roasted tomato broth, accompanied by grilled bread, was a mixed blessing. Some of the clams were rubbery, but the sauce was so delicious we used the bread to sop up every bit of it.</p>
        <p>Speaking of bread, the restaurant serves squares of homemade bacon-cheddar-jalapeno bread. They are savory, but we found ourselves on every visit wondering where the bread plates were.</p>
        <p>Aside from the absent bread plates, which may have been a dining room slip-up or simply the restaurant's policy, service was super. Our savvy waitress took no notes, got everything right and anticipated our needs.</p>
        <p>Desserts are few in number (only four, including sorbets and a cheese plate) and while good, are not as exciting as the rest of the meal. A satiny lemongrass-coconut creme brulee generated the most enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>Blond, with its hard surfaces and sleek good looks, can be loud when full. As we left, my mother whispered, ''It was too noisy, but everything else was wonderful.'' As usual, mother was right.</p>
