        <p>As a union protest at a lumberyard stretched into its seventh month, community groups, religious organizations and high school students have joined workers in criticizing a business they say has locked out employees and refused to pay fair wages. The focus of the protest is Rode &amp; Horn Lumber, a company at 90 Waterbury Street that supplies high-end wood to carpenters and furniture makers.</p>
        <p>Twelve employees have been demonstrating outside the lumberyard since October, after months of dispute over a new contract. Timothy Lynch, president of Teamsters Local 1205, which represents the workers, said the company tried to break off relations with the union three years ago. Eventually the National Labor Relations Board ordered the lumberyard to negotiate with the union.</p>
        <p>But, he added: ''It's been one and a half years, and they've failed to sign a contract. For seven months now they've locked the men out and replaced them with scab labor.''</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Lynch, employees had been earning an average of $11 an hour and the union wanted to increase wages to nearly $17, the average for city lumber workers. Joshua and Lazer Sternhell, the owners, had offered an increase of 10 cents an hour.</p>
        <p>In recent months, local religious organizations and community groups have written to the company in support of the workers, many of whom have been with the lumberyard for decades. In March, representatives of several organizations tried to meet with the Sternhells.</p>
        <p>''They wouldn't meet with us,'' said Stephen Jenkins, a coordinator for Make the Road by Walking, a Bushwick community group that was represented at the meeting. ''We met with a lower-level supervisor, and he said he would pass on our message to them. But we haven't heard from them. It's frustrating.''</p>
        <p>Students at the nearby Progress High School have discussed the situation in their social studies classes, and several joined in a worker protest on Monday. Many students whose parents work at similar union jobs identify with the workers. ''If they did that to them,'' said Anny Rodriguez, 16, ''they could do it to our parents.''</p>
        <p>Lazer Sternhell said he sympathized with the workers, but he called the union's demands unreasonable.</p>
        <p>''We've been accused of slave-driving and mistreating workers,'' he said. ''However, Local 1205 is requiring a 35 percent raise while nationally collective bargaining agreements are 3 percent.''</p>
        <p>In March, the National Labor Relations Board issued unfair-labor charges against the company. If there is no settlement, the case could go to trial.</p>
