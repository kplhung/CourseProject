        <p>O'CONNOR-John Cardinal. The Board of Trustees and staff of Our Lady of Mercy Healthcare System, Our Lady of Mercy Medical Center and Saint Agnes Hospital and Children's Rehabilitation Center acknowledge with a deep sense of personal loss the passing of His Eminence, John Cardinal O'Connor. His Eminence made extraordinary personal contributions to health care and education and tireless efforts to reestablish and revitalize the essential Catholic mission, that of providing the highest quality health care for everyone. We at Our Lady Of Mercy Medical Center were very honored that His Eminence allowed us to name our Medical Center Campus at East 233rd Street in the Bronx in his honor. His Eminence had a particular fondness for our program at Rosalie Hall, our 28bed residence and shelter program for single mothers. He was very grateful that our medical center had a strong interest in the elderly, as well as our fragile newborns. He always emphasized the importance of taking care of the needs of those just entering the world and those at the end of life. The lives that he touched will never be the same. We will miss him. We extend our deepest sympathies to his family, the auxiliary bishops and priests, religious and laity of the Archdiocese of New York. Edwin S. Mruk, Chairman Board of Trustees, The Catholic Health Care System and Our Lady of Mercy Healthcare System William F. Harrington, Esq. Chairman, Board of Trustees Saint Agnes Hospital and Children's Rehabilitation Center Gary S.

        <p>O'CONNOR-John Cardinal. The Board of Trustees of the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York wishes to express profound sorrow and a deep sense of personal loss at the death of His Eminence John Cardinal O'Connor, Archbishop of New York and President of this charitable Federation. Throughout a lifetime characterized by extraordinary accomplishments and service, Cardinal O'Connor was foremost and preeminently a dedicated priest, imbued with love of God and love for all God's people. His leadership and many initiatives on behalf of the poor and disadvantaged of the Archdiocese have been a source of untold strength to this Board and a special blessing from Almighty God. With loving concern, our Good Shepherd recognized the demands of our changing times and encouraged tirelessly the development of many new programs for the benefit of children and youth, recent immigrants and refugees, the aged, the homeless, handicapped and the sick. As the Shepherd of God's people, his concerns were universal as he devoted himself with apostolic charity and zeal to the welfare and the best interest of all, not only in New York but throughout the United States, the Americas and the Third World. We thank Almighty God for sharing with us the faith and wisdom, the strength and the talents of his devoted servant, John Cardinal O'Connor. His memory and example will remain with us as a lasting legacy and inspiration. The Board of Trustees of The Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York Most Rev. Patrick J. Sheraton Vice President Rev. Msgr. James J. Murray Secretary</p>
        <p>O'CONNOR-John Cardinal. On behalf of the Board of Directors, Administration, staff, volunteers, and patients of Calvary Hospital, Inc., and the Board of Directors of the Calvary Fund, Inc., we mourn the passing of our beloved Archbishop, Honorary Chairman, and dear friend, John Cardinal O'Connor. His wisdom, spirituality, commitment and leadership were an inspiration to all New Yorkers and to the world. His compassion in word and deed will continue within all of us. We are grateful to the life and love of John Cardinal O'Connor. He was a true friend to our patients; they identified with his suffering and he offered them hope. With sorrow in our hearts, we extend our prayerful condolences to the members of this family. Thomas J. Fahey, Jr., MD Chairman of the Calvary Hospital Board of Directors Dennis E. Berberich Chairman of the Calvary Fund Board of Directors Frank A. Calamari President-Executive Director Michael J. Brescia, MD Medical Director James E. Cimino, MD Director of Calvary Palliative Care Institute Richard J. Kutilek Chief Operating Officer Roy Clary, Exec. Vice-President Calvary Fund Admin. Council</p>
        <p>O'CONNOR-John Cardinal. The President, Chancellor, Boards of Governors and Overseers, faculty, administration and students of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion deeply mourn the death of John Cardinal O'Connor, honorary alumnus of the CollegeInstitute. His spiritual sensitivity and administrative wisdom reached well beyond his own confessional community. His guidance and insight served to build bridges of understanding among the diverse religious communities of New York City. As a distinguished religious leader he helped his Church and our larger society so that humankind might triumph. His sterling character won the respect and admiration of not only those of his own faith community but from members of many other religious faiths. We knew that his untiring efforts had been directed to preserving the precious ideals and values which we share and that his labors toward understanding helped lead to the establishment of formal diplomatic relations between the State of Israel and the Holy See. May his memory be for a blessing. Rabbi Sheldon Zimmerman President, HUC-JIR Dr. Alfred Gottschalk, Chancellor Burton Lehman, Chair, Board of Governors</p>
        <p>O'CONNOR-John Cardinal.

We join with sensitive humanity everywhere in giving thanks to God for the nobility of his life and the glory of his accomplishments. With matchless integrity and indomitable courage, he served his Church, simultaneously reaching out in heroic and creative ways to build genuine bridges of dialogue and understanding with Judaism and the Jewish people. No one in the American Catholic hierachy past or present, has been as caring and faithful a friend to the Jewish people as was His Eminence. He taught both Christians and Jews that theological differences, though profound and decisive, need not be barriers to love and understanding. We will cherish his memory as a blessing and the legacy he bequeaths is inscribed upon our hearts and written within our souls. Dr. Ronald B. Sobel, Senior Rabbi David E. Marrus, President Herbert C. Bernard, Secretary</p>
