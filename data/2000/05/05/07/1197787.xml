        <p>Roger Bannister, the first person to run a sub-four-minute mile, said today he thought that increased use of blood testing could help curb the use of performance-enhancing drugs by track and field athletes.</p>
        <p>Urine testing is fine for anabolic steroids but less sensitive than blood testing, Bannister said in an inteview before he was inducted into the International Scholar-Athlete Hall of Fame on the campus of the University of Rhode Island in Kingston.</p>
        <p>It's best if you set a criteria for an average amount of red cells and if someone goes beyond that level they can't compete. But there's quite a bit of opposition to blood-testing because a lot of people feel it's an offense against a person.</p>
        <p>Bannister, 71, who has written and lectured extensively on neurology while also serving on several British and international sports bodies, was inducted 46 years to the day that he broke the 4-minute barrier for the mile. On April 6, 1954, Bannister, a 25-year-old medical student, ran a mile in 3 minutes 59.4 seconds on a cinder track at Oxford University, which he had attended.</p>
        <p>Also inducted into the hall of fame today were Tenley Albright, also a medical doctor who in 1953 became the first American woman to win a world figure skating championship and who won a gold medal in figure skating in the 1956 Winter Olympics; Joan Benoit Samuelson, who in 1983 set a world record in the women's marathon and then won the first women's Olympic marathon in 1984, and Paul Robeson, an all-America football player at Rutgers who went on to become an internationally acclaimed singer, actor and political activist.</p>
