        <p>THE main luxury hotel is still being used as a military barracks, and tractors and earth-moving trucks now provide the only traffic along the main drag that used to bustle with nightclubs and restaurants. Four months after floods and mud slides devastated the Caribbean coast just north of here, tourism in Venezuela's main beach playground zone remains crippled.</p>
        <p>The disaster was the worst in the modern history of this South American nation of 23 million people, killing several thousand people and leaving an additional 150,000 homeless. But the toll to the economy and infrastructure has also proved immense, and recovery efforts throughout the coastal state of Vargas have been slowed by the inability of authorities to marshal money, organization, personnel and equipment.</p>
        <p>According to government statistics, tourist arrivals in Venezuela fell by more than  25 percent in 1999, with the sharpest decline coming at the end of the year, normally the busiest period here. Figures for the first quarter of this year haven't been announced, but tour and hotel operators say they will be even more discouraging.</p>
        <p>Hardest hit by the rivers of mud that came cascading down Mount Avila, which separates this capital of six million people from coastal resort towns, were dozens of hotels and time-share condominiums that had sprung up along the shore. The luxury Sheraton Macuto, where army troops are now lodged, is expected to reopen this year, but some smaller hotels built on gullies are not expected to reopen, and the timetable for others is unclear.</p>
        <p>''The situation continues to be difficult, with some hotels still buried in mud,'' said Hugo Arrioja, president of the Hotel Federation of Venezuela. ''We have to recognize that some of the smaller ones are going to be closed for good, but we hope that the majority will be able to re-establish themselves.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Arrioja acknowledged that the disaster zone's beaches, its main lure, are also  ''totally damaged'' and that tourism there is going to have to find a new focus, such as mountain climbing or fishing. While no one knows for certain how many people died in the floods that began Dec. 15, it is assumed that hundreds or even thousands of bodies were entombed under the avalanches of mud, boulders and other debris that  engulfed and destroyed several popular beaches.</p>
        <p>The disaster also forced the closing of both Venezuela's main international airport at Maiquetia and the nearby port of La Guaira, used by cruise ships, for several weeks. Both have now reopened, and while there is nothing for visitors to see in the immediate vicinity other than tent cities and reconstruction work, Venezuelan officials emphasize that the rest of the country was unaffected by the calamity and remains open for business.</p>
        <p>''It may be five years before tourism can resume in the 25-mile coastal strip that was damaged,'' said Maria Eugenia Loriente, director of Corpoturismo, the government tourism agency. ''But we still have more than 1,500 miles of coastline that were unaffected, as well as Amazon jungles, Angel Falls and plains teeming with wildlife, all of which are hundreds of miles away from the disaster zone and are of greater interest to foreign tourists anyway.''</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, visitors from abroad still seem to be staying away from this country, which is larger than Texas. Linda Sonderman, an American who runs Alpi Tour, a travel agency here specializing in adventure tourism, estimates that her bookings are down 40 percent this year and places the blame on lack of information and publicity.</p>
        <p>''Venezuela is still as spectacular as ever, but the fact is that people are still worried and nothing has been done to dispel the idea that this disaster was not localized,'' she said. ''It shouldn't be affecting things anymore, but it is, and we are just beginning to recover.''</p>
        <p>The tourism industry here was already confronting difficulties before the December mudslides, so not all of the decline can be attributed to the disaster. Perhaps the most expensive country in South America, Venezuela has a currency that economists say is overvalued by as much as 50 percent, making accommodations and meals more expensive than in neighboring countries.</p>
        <p>One side effect of the disaster, travel agents here said, is that many middle-class Venezuelans who in the past spent their holidays in the affected zone are now heading for nearby Caribbean destinations such as Aruba, Curacao and the Dominican Republic. As a result, fewer hotel rooms than usual may be available there, they said.</p>
