        <p>A planned merger between the Hudson United Bancorp of Mahwah and the New York-based Dime Bancorp has been called off. The two companies announced that they were canceling the stock options granted to each other in connection with the agreement, which was announced in September. They have declined to discuss reasons for ending the agreement, but Dime has been the target of a hostile takeover bid by the North Fork Bancorporation of Melville, N.Y., which had challenged the Dime-Hudson United agreement in court. Hudson United Bancorp is the holding company for Hudson United Bank, which has more than 200 branches in New Jersey, New York, Connecticut and Pennsylvania. As a major mortgage lender in New Jersey, Hudson United had been the subject of complaints by consumer groups about its lending record in minority areas.</p>
