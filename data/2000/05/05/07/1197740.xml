        <p>Theirs was a belated arrival, but the Philadelphia Phillies finally made an appearance in the 2000 season last week.</p>
        <p>Until they peeked out from their realm of repose, sort of like the groundhog on Feb. 2 in another Pennsylvania town, the Phillies seemed as if they might just take a pass on this season. Until they erupted for 14 runs and a second successive victory against Cincinnati, the Phillies had shown no evidence of life. Their vital signs were as comatose as their third-base coach's signs were unproductive.</p>
        <p>''We just haven't hit,'' General Manager Ed Wade was saying as the Phillies began their game against the Reds last Thursday.</p>
        <p>Wade was explaining his team's putrid first month. ''It's nothing more complicated than that,'' he said. ''Collectively, we've gotten off to a horrible start offensively. It's tough to win games when you're not scoring. Looking back at our club coming out of spring training, you wouldn't figure it was a team that couldn't score runs.''</p>
        <p>The night before, the Phillies defeated the Reds for only their third victory in the last 15 games, and they had raised the National League's lowest batting average by .003 to .230. But even after they erupted with a 21-hit barrage before Wade's eyes and sent the team average soaring to .242, they remained the league's lowest-scoring team.</p>
        <p>They also ended their series with the struggling Reds and began a three-game weekend series with the Atlanta Braves, whose lead over them, 11 games following the split of the first two games, is the largest margin in the major leagues. A groundhog couldn't have dug a deeper hole.</p>
        <p>''We can't go back and change a 7-17 April,'' Wade said. ''We realize what that means. We can't do anything about it. I think some people would like us to throw up our hands and surrender. But we don't do that. Our guys aren't made that way.''</p>
        <p>Players, however, tend to try to do too much when confronted with rampant adversity. A player in an 0-for-18 slump tries to get three hits in one at-bat. Teams distant from first place try to make up six games in one night.</p>
        <p>''I think it's been impressed upon them that we can't approach it that we're going to make up for 7-17 in four days,'' Wade said. ''We have to continue to play the game the right way and hopefully mount up more wins than losses. We need a couple teams in our division to slow down a little bit. I know they ran off a 15-game streak, but the Braves hopefully can't do that another time or two.''</p>
        <p>If the Phillies harbor thoughts of upending the Braves this season, they can put their efforts to better use, like trying to catch the Mets, who have had their own nightmarish experience since winning nine in a row, a streak that now seems a little less remote than ancient history.</p>
        <p>The Phillies played their first 23 games without Curt Schilling, their No. 1 pitcher and the soul of the team. Last season the Phillies resembled a wild-card contender until Schilling went on the disabled list with an ailing right shoulder.</p>
        <p>They were four games back in the wild-card race when Schilling pitched for the last time before going on the disabled list in August. When he returned nearly four weeks later in September, they trailed the Mets by 13 1/2 games.</p>
        <p>Returning last week following off-season shoulder surgery, Schilling, who last night pitched an 11-hit shutout against the Braves, is viewed as a catalyst who can stir the team. Wade sees that possibility, but he expressed a cautionary note.</p>
        <p>''People are trying to link our problems in the latter stages of last season with the problems at the beginning of this season,'' the general manager said. ''I think they're unrelated.''</p>
        <p>Not even Schilling has repeatedly won games in which the Phillies scored no more than three or four runs, an offensive development that occurred in 19 of the first 25 games. With basically the same hitters last season, the Phillies finished in the top half-dozen teams offensively.</p>
        <p>But they went to Atlanta last in total bases and only one home run ahead of the lowest home run total. They had been last in home runs before Mike Lieberthal and Rob Ducey connected against the Reds on Thursday for the team's first home runs in six games.</p>
        <p>Last season, Lieberthal, Doug Glanville, Bobby Abreu and Alex Arias were the team's .300 hitters. Right now only Abreu is on that level. A five-hit game Thursday raised Glanville's average by 34 points to .284; it's now .286. Lieberthal is up to .275. Arias is hitting .088. Others not contributing offensively included Ron Gant (.231), Desi Relaford (.213) and Kevin Jordan (.159).</p>
        <p>''We feel good and continue to feel good about our lineup,'' Wade said. ''The best alternative we have right now is to be patient. The wolves at this point have a lot of suggestions about knee-jerk reactions we should be having. But you can't make decisions based on knee-jerk reactions. The dumbest thing we could do is be impatient and make moves based on what has happened.''</p>
        <p>Expos' Express Stalls</p>
        <p>The Montreal Expos seemed to be off to a promising season. Then they arrived in Colorado. The Expos, with a 14-9 record, should have been suspicious; the Rockies had just scored 29 runs in a three-game series with the Mets, even though they lost two of the games. But Colorado did not lose any of the three games with the Expos, amassing 43 runs and 55 hits.</p>
        <p>''It's not like you can't explain it,'' said Jim Beattie, the Expos' general manager, a witness to the series in Colorado. ''You can explain it. We just didn't pitch well. I don't know if we go in there and say we can't pitch here. We pitched up. We hung a lot of sliders, breaking balls, changeups. We didn't pitch inside well. Jeffrey Hammonds hit a grand slam on an 0-2 fastball. We just didn't locate fastballs. That has nothing to do with pitching in Denver or anywhere else. We made a lot of bad pitches. So it's explainable.''</p>
        <p>Indians Look to Rebound</p>
        <p>The joke could be on the Indians. Frustrated by their failure to win a World Series, the Indians fired Manager Mike Hargrove and named Charlie Manuel, their hitting coach, to replace him. General Manager John Hart said the team needed a new voice in the dugout. The problem is that new voice may be lulling the Indians to sleep.</p>
        <p>Cleveland's five-time division champions are struggling through the kind of start they thought they left behind when they became a force in the American League six years ago. This season, however, matches the start they had in 1997.</p>
        <p>That April, they were not in first place for 17 successive days. Today marks the 17th successive day they have not been in first this season. Their record is 14-13, the same as it was three years ago. The Indians went on that season to fall two outs short of winning the World Series.</p>
        <p>'That's Business'</p>
        <p>At 22, Jermaine Dye played in the World Series for the Atlanta Braves. At 26, Dye is a star for the Kansas City Royals.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't matter what team I'm on, as long as I'm in the big leagues fulfilling a dream,'' Dye said. ''It would have been nice to play my whole career in Atlanta, but it didn't work out. Maybe someday I'll get a chance to go back there, but right now I'm happy where I am.''</p>
        <p>After hitting .281 as a Braves rookie in 1996, Dye figured to be with them for a while. The next year, he said, he had a good spring and prepared to settle in, especially after David Justice and Marquis Grissom were traded late in spring training. ''I thought I was going to be slotted in to play every day,'' Dye said. ''All of a sudden I got traded'' -- two days after the other trade.</p>
        <p>Dye said he did not know how to react to being traded for the first time, especially at such a young age. But, he added: ''I knew Kansas City wanted me and liked me a lot. I just needed to go over there, put on a new uniform and realize I'm on a new team.''</p>
        <p>Dye struggled his first two seasons with the Royals; in fact, he spent part of each season in the minor leagues. But last season he blossomed with a .294 batting average, 27 home runs and 119 runs batted in. That performance set him up for what he has done early this season.</p>
        <p>Entering yesterday's schedule, he led the American League in home runs (12), doubles (13), slugging percentage (.784), total bases (91) and extra-base hits (25). He was tied for second in hits (42), tied for sixth in runs scored (24), fourth in runs batted in (29) and fourth in hitting (.362).</p>
        <p>But he was not among the leaders in outfield assists, as he was last season when his 17 assists were tied for first. ''This year I don't have any,'' he said. ''This year guys aren't running on me.''</p>
        <p>The Power Company</p>
        <p>Before batters hit 931 home runs this April, the most productive April for home runs was in the 1996 season. If this season proceeds like that one, the home run frequency is very likely to slow. That April produced 2.30 home runs a game, but the average for the entire season wound up at 2.18 a game. This April's average was 2.56.</p>
        <p>Big Deals, Small Numbers</p>
        <p>The biggest moves the Cincinnati Reds made last winter were the acquisitions of Ken Griffey Jr. and Dante Bichette. A year earlier, they traded for Michael Tucker. Those three formed the Reds' starting outfield on opening day. Griffey is hitting .211, Bichette .222 and Tucker .162.</p>
        <p>Detroit did not figure on a .225 average for Juan Gonzalez when it traded for him and offered him a $140 million contract. But then Gabe Kapler, who went to Texas in the Gonzalez trade, is hitting .200. Reggie Sanders was traded to Atlanta and is hitting .139. Mark McLemore signed with Seattle as a free agent and has a .204 average.</p>
        <p>While Derek Bell floats in the high .300's for the Mets, Roger Cedeno is hitting .202 for Houston.</p>
        <p>Some other bad early averages of players who aren't new to their teams: Tony Clark, .155; Rey Ordonez, .179; Ray Lankford, .187; Homer Bush, .192; Jose Offerman, .198; Rickey Henderson, .203; Cliff Floyd, .203; and Eric Karros, .204.</p>
