        <p>Laurence Maslon letter comments on A O Scott's April 16 article on Stanley Kubrick film, Barry Lyndonm</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>According to A. O. Scott's article and the letters in response to it [''Opening Eyes to a Kubrick Masterpiece,'' April 16], the debate seems to go on about Stanley Kubrick's ''Barry Lyndon.'' At New York University's Graduate Acting Program, we can come down on the ''pro'' side with confidence. I have screened this film religiously every year in my ''Culture of Style'' class. Beyond the film's value for its gloriously refined period detail, it has proved invaluable for teaching about Brecht. With its ironic narration and its sophisticated understanding of the subtle yet byzantine dealings of class warfare, ''Barry Lyndon'' is one of the few American films to explore without sentimentality how society conducted its affairs before the beginning of this century. Viewers in 1975 may have found ''Barry Lyndon'' simply picture perfect -- we find it a perfect picture.</p>
