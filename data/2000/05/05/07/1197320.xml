        <p>JACKSON, Miss., is way too hot in August to so much as contemplate, but in November, when my 10-year-old son, Sam, and I unfold ourselves from the minivan, we are greeted by sunny skies, sweet-smelling air, and enough snap, crackle and pop to require a lightweight sweater. It's autumn in Mississippi's capital and largest city -- a metropolis of some 400,000 souls -- and we have a long list of things we want to do.</p>
        <p>But first we have to extricate ourselves from our bed-and-breakfast -- the charming, comfortable and clean Millsaps Buie House, a Victorian mansion. The problem is, the desk manager is a Southerner. Ergo, he likes to talk. He wants to make sure we are properly oriented and provisioned.

        <p>JACKSON, Miss., is way too hot in August to so much as contemplate, but in November, when my 10-year-old son, Sam, and I unfold ourselves from the minivan, we are greeted by sunny skies, sweet-smelling air, and enough snap, crackle and pop to require a lightweight sweater. It's autumn in Mississippi's capital and largest city -- a metropolis of some 400,000 souls -- and we have a long list of things we want to do.</p>
        <p>But first we have to extricate ourselves from our bed-and-breakfast -- the charming, comfortable and clean Millsaps Buie House, a Victorian mansion. The problem is, the desk manager is a Southerner. Ergo, he likes to talk. He wants to make sure we are properly oriented and provisioned. ''Y'all have a wonderful day,'' he calls as we finally edge our way out of the door, adding ''Let me know if I can be of any help!''</p>
        <p>Yes, it's true. Generally speaking, Southerners are nicer than Northerners; they're more pleasant, less hurried, less brusque and considerably more gracious, even when their jobs don't entail catering to paying guests. And Jackson -- in the heart of the deep South -- strikes me as being the apotheosis of some essential, ultimately tragic and self-consciously romantic quality of Southernness. Occupied by Union troops four times during the Civil War, and finally reduced primarily to smoke and ashes, the unimpressive city of barely 5,000 souls that once presided over a slave state rebounded to thrive on King Cotton. Jackson went on to become a city of broad avenues, eclectic architectural styles, churches on every corner, big old oaks and magnolias -- and a large population of disenfranchised blacks. It was there, in June 1963, that the civil rights leader Medgar Evers was murdered by a single gunshot to his back, and where Miss Eudora Welty, as she's called, wrote ''Why I Live at the P.O.'' The place, populated today by roughly equal numbers of blacks and whites, is dripping with history.</p>
        <p>Though Sam is lobbying hard to start out with a visit to the Mississippi Sports Hall of Fame, I overrule his choice in favor of the Old State Capitol, a few blocks from our B &amp; B. This imposing Greek Revival brick building did indeed serve as Mississippi's statehouse from 1839 until 1903, when it became too small. It was here that the state voted to secede from the Union, Jefferson Davis gave a rousing speech, and the governor was arrested at the end of the Civil War.</p>
        <p>Today the restored building is home to the Old Capitol Museum, with exhibitions ranging from prehistory nearly to the present, with plenty of muskets, battle swords, silver tea services and cotton gins in between. But Sam is riveted by the film of the civil rights movement. And there in front of us are images from my own childhood: luncheon sit-ins; blacks being clubbed by the police; guard dogs chasing black children; people singing in jail cells. Sam, wincing, says ''I thought this was supposed to be America.''</p>
        <p>Now, of course, Jackson is integrated. Like a city trapped in a time warp, it's still small enough for one to see just about everything on foot. Sam's still badgering me about the Sports Hall of Fame, but I vote for History, so we head off to the New State Capitol, which is still called that, even though it was completed in 1903. Surrounded by a wide lawn filled with large magnolia trees, and loosely modeled after the Capitol building in Washington, this Beaux-Arts beauty has a black-and-white Italian marble rotunda topped with a gold-plated copper eagle whose wings span 15 feet. Inside there are stained-glass windows depicting the history of Mississippi, elevators with old-fashioned glass doors, and guards who glance up briefly from their newspapers to say ''How y'all doing today?'' Sam has a field day in the former Supreme Court room reading the laws concerning, for example, animal-drawn vehicles.</p>
        <p>As a boy who himself lives in the state capital just down the road a spell -- in Baton Rouge -- Sam knows how much Southern governors like to press the flesh, and so decides that, as long as we're in the neighborhood, we should pay a visit to the governor of Mississippi. But the governor isn't in. A sympathetic guard points us to the top floor of the Sills Building, a modern state office building across the street.</p>
        <p>''The governor's not here, Sugar'' the receptionist on the 20th floor tells us, ''but let's just see if maybe we can find someone else for you.'' And O.K., so maybe Kirk Fordice was the first Republican governor since Reconstruction, and Sam and I are diehard liberals -- it's still a mighty friendly gesture when Mark Henry, Fordice's chief of staff, appears in the hallway, shakes Sam's hand, and leads the two of us back to a conference room for a short conference on matters of social policy.</p>
        <p>Afterward, we head a few blocks south, to the Governor's Mansion, which is open for public visits, but apparently the governor, just back from California, isn't receiving callers.</p>
        <p>No matter. The restored Greek Revival mansion itself is worth it. The second-oldest continuously occupied gubernatorial residence in the country (after Virginia's), it's filled with mahogany tables, Grecian-form sofas, Renaissance Revival half-tester beds, and walls painted in dusty rose, cream, deep gold and pumpkin-orange. The curator tells us that although it survived the Civil War, it was almost demolished at the turn of the last century, to make room for commercial development. Fortunately, the outraged citizens of Mississippi would have none of that, and fixed it up instead.</p>
        <p>In fact, there is little anywhere in downtown Jackson to suggest the sacrifice of aesthetics to commercialism, and, unlike other Sun Belt cities of the New South, it hasn't become a sprawl of minimalls, minimansions, hideous office towers and parking complexes. True, on any given weekday, you may spot a handful of business executives chatting on cell phones as they exit Morgan Stanley or Merrill Lynch, but what you mainly notice -- once you get past Jackson's dreary outskirts -- is that the downtown area looks like an actual, bona fide city, with sidewalks, cafes, and all kinds of architectural gems.</p>
        <p>Among them are the 10-story Lamar Life Building, Jackson's first ''skyscraper,'' white-faced, adorned with Gothic motifs, and topped by a crenelated clock tower; the six-story brick Heritage Building, built in 1905 as the Jones-Kennington Dry Goods Store; the mid-19th-century City Hall; and the Art Deco Court House, with its geometric designs of eagles and stars inside and out. And then there are the churches: St. Andrew's Episcopal, the Cathedral of St. Peter the Apostle, First Baptist and Galloway Memorial United Methodist Church, all dressed up in Gothic, Late Gothic, and neo-Classical Revival styles.</p>
        <p>''Mom,'' Sam says on our way back to our B &amp; B, ''have you ever heard of the Hall of Fame?''</p>
        <p>Indeed, you can't drag a 10-year-old boy through a walking history lesson forever, so the next day we hit the attractions geared to kids. At the Russell C. Davis Planetarium we catch a film on the asteroid belt. Unfortunately for Sam, however, the Planetarium is adjacent to the Mississippi Museum of Art -- where I zoom through several centuries and styles of art in about 10 minutes, while Sam, beside me, continues to remind me that he's more interested in sports. But by now we're hungry, so we head off -- again on foot -- to a Jackson classic: the charmingly down-at-the-heel Mayflower Restaurant, where the accents are even thicker than the slabs of pie, and the concept of low fat has yet to be discovered.</p>
        <p>At last we get back in the car, bound for the Sports Museum, which is adjacent to the Mississippi Agriculture and Forestry Museum. Amazingly, Sam allows me to start him off at the Ag Museum (as it's called locally). In fact, he's fascinated by it. Stuffy it isn't. On the contrary, the museum is a mainly outdoors affair, spread out over 40 acres, and starring a restored 19th-century working homestead, with farm animals and a Bisland cotton gin, circa 1860. There's also a small town, with a main street, country doctor's office, print shop, blacksmith's shop, grist mill, filling station, schoolhouse, country church, and vegetable and herb garden.</p>
        <p>''The Hall of Fame?'' Sam says.</p>
        <p>To me, the Hall of Fame is hokey, but Sam is riveted. On the first floor of this contemporary red brick building there is an introductory movie with soaring music, as well as displays of uniforms and sports equipment that once belonged to the most famous athletes from Mississippi, the Cardinals pitchers Dizzy Dean and his brother Daffy among them. It's all I can do to drag him away from the virtual reality baseball game in which he strikes out three out of four batters, and when we get to the Wall of Baseball -- with displays on the minor leagues and the Negro leagues -- I'm a goner.</p>
        <p>At last I'm able to coax Sam away. We head back toward the downtown area so I can see the Farish Street Historical District on the west end of downtown.</p>
        <p>The Metro Jackson brochure I was consulting said that the district included over 690 listings in the National Register of Historic Places, boasting a mix of antebellum, Creole, Queen Anne, shotgun and bungalow cottages, but what Sam and I first see is a black slum of substandard housing, chain-link fences, weed-filled patches of front yards and badly sagging front porches. But then we turn the corner, and come upon row after row of small, neat, restored shotguns painted pale green, gray and eggplant, with cream-colored trim. In fact, the entire 125-acre district is undergoing a somewhat stalled restoration. Once, paradoxically thanks to segregation, it was a thriving black community, where, in the 30's and 40's, such music greats as Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong performed at the Crystal Palace Night Club (now the site of a club called Birdland), and in the 50's and 60's civil rights heroes like Martin Luther King and Medgar Evers planned and organized.</p>
        <p>We then stop at the Smith Robertson Museum and Cultural Center, named for a black community leader who was born a slave, earned his living as a barber and served as an alderman. The museum, a somewhat ramshackle affair, is in the Smith Robertson Elementary School, Jackson's first public school for black children, and is devoted to portraying the experience of black Mississippians. There's plenty here for both of us, from artifacts to newspaper clippings to photographs to artworks. Sam is particularly taken with a picture of a one-room schoolhouse, where hordes of kids surround a single rough-hewn table over which a single teacher presides.</p>
        <p>Outside the sun is setting and the neighborhood kids are playing basketball. In this city soaked in the blood of the Civil War and the civil rights movement, there's still plenty of Southern charm, side by side with a shameful legacy.</p>
        <p>Magnolias and baseball</p>
