        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's latest plan to export nearly 10,000 tons of city trash a day is winning widespread praise, even from the New Jersey community that would handle most of the garbage after the city's last landfill shuts down.</p>
        <p>It is a startling contrast to the last disposal plan Mr. Giuliani offered a year and a half ago, which evoked little but ridicule and protest. But critical components of the new effort remain undecided, including just what should happen with a large chunk of city garbage that would not be shipped through the proposed new garbage-barge port of Linden, N.J.</p>
        <p>And opposition has not subsided in states like Virginia, Ohio and Pennsylvania, where at least some of the trash most likely would be buried. The Giuliani administration is also acknowledging for the first time that exporting trash in the long-term will cost the city about $323 million a year, $90 million more than had been projected in a more preliminary assessment two years ago.</p>
        <p>No one suggested that it would be easy to figure out how to get rid of the city's residential garbage after the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island closes in 2001. Once the plan is in place, it will involve the largest long-distance movement of trash by a single local government in the nation's history, industry experts say.</p>
        <p>''We are trying to do what no other city has ever done on this scale,'' said Councilman Stanley E. Michels, a Manhattan Democrat and chairman of the Environmental Protection Committee, which is reviewing the mayor's latest plan.</p>
        <p>A sizable chunk of the city's trash is already being sent out of state -- about 7,000 tons a day to Virginia landfills, a Newark incinerator and other sites. But no one, including officials in the Giuliani administration, considers this situation acceptable over the long term, because most of the waste is being moved by truck, an extremely expensive approach that studies have suggested is adding significantly to local air pollution and highway, bridge and tunnel congestion.</p>
        <p>To find long-term solutions, the Giuliani administration has had to identify spots within or near New York City where the trash can be assembled and packed into rail cars or barges, a more environmentally friendly and inexpensive way to move trash over long distances. Then, working with trash disposal contractors, it needed to find communities in the eastern United States willing to accept never-ending shipments of waste.</p>
        <p>Before last week, almost every long-term solution the city floated elicited intense opposition, adding to fears among some environmentalists that the truck-based program would continue for many years. First, community groups in the Bronx and in Brooklyn and state and local officials in New Jersey angrily denounced plans for new trash transfer stations. And officials in other states -- including Virginia and Pennsylvania -- have scoffed at suggestions they might soon become New York City's dumping grounds.</p>
        <p>Top Giuliani administration officials said late last week that the latest plan illustrates the important lessons learned from these earlier skirmishes, which peaked in late 1998 and early 1999, when both Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey and Gov. James S. Gilmore III of Virginia condemned drafts of the city's long-term trash-export plan.</p>
        <p>''It was managed differently than the first go around,'' Deputy Mayor Joseph J. Lhota said. ''Keeping people informed, talking to as many people as possible, that was our goal.''</p>
        <p>The city has abandoned plans to build large-scale new trash transfer stations in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn, as well as Hunts Point in the South Bronx and in Newark and Carteret in New Jersey. The decision has evoked celebrations among longtime opponents of these plans.</p>
        <p>The city now intends to rely on five of its smaller-scale marine transfer stations in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens, which would send as much as 6,000 tons a day of trash by barge to Linden, not far from Fresh Kills. From there, the trash would be put into sealed containers and sent by rail to landfills in Illinois, South Carolina and Georgia, among other states where the proposed contractor, Allied Waste Industries Inc., operates.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere in New York City, the Giuliani administration wants to convert two marine transfer stations -- where barges for years have carried waste to the Fresh Kills -- into smaller-scale trash compacting and shipment centers. At these and three similar transfer stations, waste would be placed into sealed containers and shipped to out-of-state landfills by train or barge.</p>
        <p>What distinguishes this proposal from the last plan is that Linden officials have already endorsed the concept. New York City neighborhood advocates are also pleased, having long urged the city to rely on the existing marine transfer stations that are in each of the boroughs, instead of just concentrating the large new ones in lower-income, ethnically diverse sections of Brooklyn and the Bronx.</p>
        <p>Officials in Linden, population 37,000, have backed the plan in part because the city would receive at least $1.2 million a year, and probably much more, for allowing the company to operate the barge-to-rail port. ''You won't see a truck,'' said Mayor John T. Gregorio, noting that the barge port would be at least two miles from the closest residential neighborhood. ''You won't smell it. I think we can ensure that our taxes won't be going up for years, and maybe they'll decrease.''</p>
        <p>Linden officials are not the only ones who have been asked in advance for input on the new plan. Mr. Lhota had a series of meetings with top New Jersey officials to brief them on the city's new approach. In 1998, before the city released its earlier draft, it did not tell Governor Whitman about plans for trash transfer stations in New Jersey until the plan was released to the public.</p>
        <p>The change in approach has been well noted. ''They are doing a much better job now then they were doing before,'' said Pete McDonough, director of communications for Mrs. Whitman. ''It is further proof that you can teach old dogs new tricks.''</p>
        <p>But a series of potential roadblocks remain. Though the Linden City Council has approved the trash transfer site, it must also win the backing of the Union County Freeholders and the New Jersey State Department of Environmental Protection. Residents some of the New Jersey communities along the garbage-train rail path -- such as Metuchen, Woodbridge and Carteret in Middlesex Counties -- have indicated they may protest the plan.</p>
        <p>''New Jersey is literally being dumped on by New York City,'' Ed O'Brien, mayor of Metuchen. ''Why doesn't Giuliani propose putting the stuff on rails and taking it across New York State?''</p>
        <p>Mr. McDonough, the spokesman for Governor Whitman, said the state will also insist that any barges coming to Linden be covered to ensure no trash can fall into the Arthur Kill. ''Either they put a lid on the trash or we will put a lid on the proposal,'' Mr. McDonough said.</p>
        <p>Under current federal law, states cannot block the flow of garbage across their borders. But legislation before Congress would permit states to limit interstate trash flows, a bill inspired in part by the pending shut-down of Fresh Kills. Seven governors -- including Mrs. Whitman, Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania and Bob Taft of Ohio -- and 48 members of Congress have signed letters in the last three months backing the legislation.</p>
        <p>For now, New York City officials are moving forward on the assumption that once they have found contractors to handle the shipment of trash, there would be no problem in sending it to communities across the country willing to take it.</p>
        <p>The City Council intends to hold a hearing on the revised trash plan in late May, while the Giuliani administration is taking public comment on its proposal through June 16. City officials say it will probably be at least four years before all aspects of the plan are in place, and trash will leave the city until then largely by truck.</p>
