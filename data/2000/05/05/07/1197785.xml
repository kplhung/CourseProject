        <p>Brown University's heavyweight squad, undefeated in varsity, junior varsity and freshman competition and ranked first among Eastern crews, solidified its ranking yesterday, convincingly defeating Princeton in all three categories under ideal racing conditions on the Tigers' home Lake Carnegie course.</p>
        <p>Princeton's varsity, ranked third after having lost to second-ranked Harvard last weekend, hoped to improve its record with a victory over the Bruins, to retain the Content Cup for the fourth consecutive year. That did not happen: the Tigers varsity lost by 7.8 seconds, the largest margin of the day, as Brown widened its lead down the entire 2,000-meter distance of the course.</p>

        <p>Brown University's heavyweight squad, undefeated in varsity, junior varsity and freshman competition and ranked first among Eastern crews, solidified its ranking yesterday, convincingly defeating Princeton in all three categories under ideal racing conditions on the Tigers' home Lake Carnegie course.</p>
        <p>Princeton's varsity, ranked third after having lost to second-ranked Harvard last weekend, hoped to improve its record with a victory over the Bruins, to retain the Content Cup for the fourth consecutive year. That did not happen: the Tigers varsity lost by 7.8 seconds, the largest margin of the day, as Brown widened its lead down the entire 2,000-meter distance of the course.</p>
        <p>The Bruin varsity, stroked by the sophomore Erik Winters, understroked the Tigers and powered away in the final 500 meters to almost a two-boatlength margin in the time of 5 minutes 44.5 seconds.</p>
        <p>After yesterday's victory, Brown will be seeded No. 1 at the Eastern Sprint Championships to be raced in Worcester, Mass., on May 21.</p>
