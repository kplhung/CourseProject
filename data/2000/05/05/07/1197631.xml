      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The ''West Wing'' company was in Washington last week, filming around the capital.</p>
        <p>Aaron Sorkin, the show's producer and writer, dropped by the New York Times bureau for lunch.</p>
        <p>The political reporters, who love the ''West Wing,'' offered one suggestion. Why not make the peripheral first lady, played by Stockard Channing, more central?</p>
        <p>Mr. Sorkin replied that he wanted the focus to be on the staffers.</p>
        <p>Exactly, said a reporter. In most modern White Houses, who has been the catalyst for the worst staff psychoses?</p>
        <p>Who is the one staffers tiptoe around, run from, kowtow to, have nightmares about, get their jobs from, get fired by, see shrinks about, turn henchmen for and secretively try to win to their side of an argument, hoping to get a pillow-talk advantage?</p>
        <p>It's Herself.</p>
        <p>Everyone in Washington knows the first lady is The Man.</p>
        <p>Everyone, it seems, except Hillary Clinton, who belittles her current job in her quest for a new one.</p>
        <p>''More than a first lady,'' is the mantra of her first Senate ad.</p>
        <p>If she is more, doesn't that make all the others, including her idol Eleanor, mere?</p>
        <p>The ad is a little astounding because it finally blurts out what we suspected Hillary felt all along: that she was entitled to more, that being the most powerful woman in American politics for eight years was not enough.</p>
        <p>The East Wing was too small -- and too frilly. She had her eyes on other wings.</p>
        <p>She underestimates her job's unique aura. Ed Rollins, the Reagan White House official who took many orders from Nancy Reagan, wryly notes: ''I've never been afraid of a U.S. senator, but I've been extremely fearful of first ladies.''</p>
        <p>Hillary's new slogan has an unfortunate ring. It underscores the image of the Clintons as inexorable.</p>
        <p>And the slogan was just another weird moment in a transcendentally weird race. The week escalated the contest of estranged marriages.</p>
        <p>First the Democratic candidate erased her married name on posters  and now she's trying to erase her tenure as first lady.</p>
        <p>The wife of the Republican candidate had also dropped her married name and distanced herself from her first ladydom.</p>
        <p>Doesn't anybody except Bob Dole want to be a first lady anymore?</p>
        <p>The Hillary ad, which does not show or mention anyone named Bill, is meant to convey that Mrs. Clinton is more than a Mrs.: ''First she became a lawyer, named one of the top hundred in America,'' the narrator says. ''Her first cause was children, fighting abuse, and chairing the board of the Children's Defense Fund. . . . More than a first lady. . . . Hillary. . . .''</p>
        <p>A picture of Hillary during her Rose Law Firm days flashes on the screen. As if the glow of the Rose Law Firm were rosier than the glow of the White House.</p>
        <p>Hillary's resume, pre-first lady, may not be as impressive as she thinks it is. This self-described activist for a better world was more of a Reagan-era yuppie lawyer with an eye for the main chance. Sitting at the right hand of Marian Wright Edelman does not entitle someone to a seat in the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>There is another quintessentially Clintonian quality to Hillary's slogan: she's triangulating against herself. Even as she dismisses the importance of first ladyhood, she reminds voters of the special prominence of the position.</p>
        <p>Basically, the message is: vote for her because she's more than the first lady, or vote for her because she is the first lady.</p>
        <p>After all, Democrats in New York enticed her into this race because they believed that her celebrity as first lady would mean a win. But here she is, suddenly venting her hate-hate relationship with her retro job title.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton was anything but a prisoner in the white satin jail, as it's been called. She had a shot at being more than a first lady while she was first lady. In 1993, she could have transformed health care in America and the first ladyship at the same time. But her plan was so big, unwieldy, bureaucratic and secretive that it flopped.</p>
        <p>If only she had known that sometimes less can be more. Now she might be running on her title instead of running from it.</p>
        <p>Just think, her slogan might be ''The Lady Is The Man.''</p>
