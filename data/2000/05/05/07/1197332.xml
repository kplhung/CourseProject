        <p>Are there facets of the inner life that emerge only within the framework of psychotherapy? How do patients' concerns reflect larger cultural dynamics? To discuss the secrets of the 50-minute world, we set up a conversation among six experts with a variety of professional perspectives. Our panel included:</p>
        <p>Ethel Person, a professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University who practices in New York and is the author, most recently, of ''The Sexual Century.''</p>
        <p>Peter D. Kramer, author of ''Listening to Prozac'' and ''Should You Leave?'' who teaches psychiatry at Brown University and practices in Providence, R.I.</p>
        <p>Martin S. Bergmann, a psychoanalyst who teaches psychiatry at New York University; he is the author of numerous works, including ''The Anatomy of Loving.''</p>
        <p>Amy Bloom, author of ''Love Invents Us,'' a novel, and the forthcoming collection ''A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You,'' who has a private practice in psychotherapy in Connecticut.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Lear, who is a member of the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago; his next book is ''Happiness, Death and the Remainder of Life.''</p>
        <p>John A. Talbott, a professor of clinical psychiatry at the University of Maryland, Baltimore, who has written extensively on chronic mental illness and publicly financed treatment.</p>
        <p>Question: If I can start the ball rolling, what are the issues that people today talk about only in the context of psychotherapy? Are there any privileged realms?</p>
        <p>Ethel Person: I think there is one realm. I think that people do not discuss their fantasies in public as much as they do in therapy because those really tap a deeper part -- and a very idiosyncratic part. I mean, typical fantasies like I want to get rich or I want a new job, that kind of thing people will talk about, but some of the kinkier sexual fantasies don't get discussed in public. Or the fantasies about which one is embarrassed.</p>
        <p>Q: Does the list of things that people are willing to talk about only in psychotherapy change over time?</p>
        <p>Person: Yes. Therapy is still where people talk about their most painful feelings. But they talk about much more personal things in public now than they did 20 or 30 years ago.</p>
        <p>Peter D. Kramer: I think it's a problem for therapy. I think that the power of therapy depends on novelty and surprise. And the enormous openness about sexuality, jealousy, violent thoughts and so on impoverishes therapy to some extent. I think therapy was probably easier to do when it was more surprising to speculate, as Freud did, that the patient may have sexual feelings of which he or she is unaware. That wouldn't shock anyone -- it wouldn't be transformative anymore.</p>
        <p>Q: So as opposed to opening up other possibilities, you feel that having gotten those kind of basic surprises out of the way lessens the possibilities for what can be discussed in therapy?</p>
        <p>Kramer: I think that one of the great jobs of psychotherapy is to create a place where very shameful aspects of the self can safely be revealed. So I think it lessens the force of revelation that so much is already revealed.</p>
        <p>Martin S. Bergmann: Cultural changes do in some way affect what patients talk about. To give an example, I have had experience with patients who develop cancer or other disabling diseases and then look upon themselves as ''damaged goods.'' Now, to me, ''damaged goods'' is a very typical American way to look at oneself, in commercial terms. For example, ''My child is a high-maintenance kid.'' That is also along the same lines.</p>
        <p>Kramer: I think it's obvious at this moment that therapy also needs to be a refuge from the commercial society. There's something about the ubiquity of value. The woman in her 50's who has just been divorced and has a sense of having no social worth -- that is the sort of thing that I think is very much at the core of a carriage-trade psychotherapeutic practice nowadays. It's discussed everywhere, but the level of pain associated with the depth of the hopelessness, I think, probably emerges in the psychotherapeutic space.</p>
        <p>Q: And this is a recent development?</p>
        <p>Kramer: I don't know, I think there's always a temptation to believe it's a recent development. But the role of the therapeutic space as a refuge from this tendency to value very exactly every person and activity in the culture seems very much in sharp focus at the moment.</p>
        <p>Amy Bloom: But I think the stain of the commercial actually works both ways. I have walked into colleagues' offices in the last five years and found people with drug-company clipboards or newsletters. I'm sure they were in some people's offices before, but certainly nobody I wanted to go and have a cup of coffee with.</p>
        <p>Jonathan Lear: There's a shift in popular culture in its relation to psychotherapy. Last decade, three popular shows on television were ''Seinfeld,'' ''Friends'' and ''Ally McBeal.'' They all shared this underlying assumption that human intimacy of the standard one-heterosexual-married-couple isn't possible. And that what there really is in the world is a conversation among one's friends or business partners or flatmates about why this more traditional idea of intimacy is just not going to work. And so it's a basically ironic stance. And then there's a shift, I think, last year, to ''The Sopranos.'' You know, this guy is a gangster, and he has his women on the side and whatever, but he's trying to make his marriage work. He's trying to deal with the responsibilities of the office. And trying to come to terms with, in terms of what Ethel was saying, very primitive fantasies that are under the surface and got him where he is. There's a kind of earnestness. It seems to me like the nature of the refuge shifted, like irony as a defense against the kinds of anxieties that have been discussed is collapsing.</p>
        <p>Bloom: Tony Soprano has a terribly earnest therapist as well. I mean, she seems utterly unable to marshal any sort of useful defenses.</p>
        <p>Person: If I were to say that there was a shift, it's that people's sense of being not in control in their lives is much more paramount than it was previously. And I would tie it to this major dislocation in terms of the way success and money are regarded. I'm not sure that the therapist's office is always a refuge. It's often a place that people come in order to figure out how to be in control -- which too often means being in control financially.</p>
        <p>Q: Can you tell me some of the ways that these economic displacements manifest themselves in the therapeutic context?</p>
        <p>Bloom: Because most of the people I work with don't actually have a lot of money, it has seemed to me over the last 20 years that there was a significant number of people who, although they would go on having unresolved issues in their lives, most of their dramatic crises that led to really terrible outcomes in their lives would have been resolved if they had had $50,000. Now, that's not to say that they couldn't also have been avoided if they had been more resourceful and less conflicted about their ability to get help. But it does often seem to me that that point at which you find yourself out of your apartment and without a car and unable to move your furniture -- some of those things could probably be avoided.</p>
        <p>Kramer: This may be half a step back, but I think some of the same issues that we've been talking about could be put in this different way, which is, I think the culture has become hard for melancholics. If you're in a culture where there's a great deal of social disruption, where people are expected to be extremely autonomous, where the divorce rate is high, where the form the families take is very diverse, it is hard to have those underlying personality traits that we talk about as melancholic -- that is, being deliberate, attaching very strongly, being loyal, being somewhat prone to depression, having low energy, even if you tend to use it well. And I do think a lot of what we see in our offices is related to a particular sort of social disruption. People might be helped by having greater resources, but they'd also be helped by having a more reliable standing and a more reliable set of connections in the culture.</p>
        <p>John A. Talbott: I can affiliate myself with Peter's remarks because I think that the people I treat, who are cognitively impaired, are also clueless to some extent about what cultural changes are going on. I think there's a sense of wanting to be part of the mainstream, but the mainstream has shifted so much.</p>
        <p>Bloom: Peter, you're saying that as the culture has shifted, it has become less accepting of certain kinds of personalities with certain sort of clusters of traits, even if the person functions reasonably well. I think that that is true. I mean, you get a great deal more leeway as a tearing narcissist in this culture than you do as someone who tends to be a little broody and little thin-skinned and maybe a little slow to speak and, you know, given to pondering. I don't think that gets you a lot of room culturally right now.</p>
        <p>Bergmann: It occurs to me that the changing roles of women, the changing expectations of women as they affect the point of view of the man, have created new kinds of marital tensions. I think that is a very important part of our culture. Also the whole question of to what extent libidinal satisfactions are obtained outside of personal realms.</p>
        <p>Lear: What do you mean by that?</p>
        <p>Bergmann: Well, let's say a professional whose satisfaction is entirely in terms of her relationship to her clients. That is her personal value system. Whatever operates there is the equivalent to what one used to call love life. There is less separation between personal and professional, and for many people the professional has become the personal. So I see it in two ways: I see it in terms of the professional invading the personal to an enormous extent, and I see it also in terms of new problems created within the couple as a result of the changing position of the woman in the marriage and the inability of the man to live up to these expectations or to be able to do justice to it.</p>
        <p>Person: You're not saying she's more consumed than male professionals, are you?</p>
        <p>Bergmann: No. In the lives of many males, the professional was always really the dominant place where most of their ambitions, most of their love needs and most of their hostilities were expressed, so that by the time you came home at 7:00 to your family in Westchester, you know, you read The New York Times and you went to sleep. It is now also much more characteristic of women. I don't mean that it's getting better or worse.</p>
        <p>Lear: There's a theme I hear emerging. I think the issues that are being raised in the social sphere, issues about ambition, striving, competition, both in the workplace and at home, have been undertheorized by therapists and analysts. Something strikes me -- you know, Aristotle says that philosophy begins in leisure. It's only when people are freed up from just struggling for survival that they can think about the meaning of life. And I think something's very similar in psychotherapy. This is a very wealthy society. And -- a similar point -- when people get freed up via drug therapy from the acute crisis of mental illness, they're freed up to worry about the meaning of their lives. I mean, to worry, ''Am I capable of a deep, intimate relationship?'' is to some extent a luxury. So it's possible that there's going to be a freeing up to be worried about the kinds of issues that psychotherapy addresses.</p>
        <p>Bloom: Well, there'll be a freeing up, but I guess one of the questions that that raised here is, given the direction of the culture, will people worry about the nature of their intimate relationships? Or will they feel that that's the last thing in the world they would want to spend time on -- that though they have terrible relationships, they should go out and buy something?</p>
        <p>Lear: I don't think that'll last. That's a defense that won't -</p>
        <p>Bloom: No, I agree that it's a defense that leaks all over the place, which is why you see people with money in treatment.</p>
        <p>Q: A number of you have started doing couples therapy, as opposed to classic one-on-one analysis. Is that part of a general profession-wide outreach? Or does it reflect some other trend?</p>
        <p>Kramer: I think it's not a coincidence. I turned to couples therapy as a more important part of my practice partly because of the notion that there are some people who really do have different and more complete selves in a relationship than they have in isolation. I think the issue of the fragility of the couple has become extremely important and shows itself in all sorts of areas even when divorce is not an issue. In terms of the balance of power within marriage, in terms of aspirations of young women, it just seems to me that some constant awareness of the fragility of marriage permeates all sorts of aspects of therapy.</p>
        <p>Bloom: Actually, two changes that I have observed are that I certainly see far more same-sex couples than I used to whose concerns are not either cultural homophobia or internalized homophobia. And those people tend to be, I have to say, highly committed. I think the other change is, people are more expressive more quickly of their loneliness within the marriage. It's not that they are more lonely, but they no longer feel that it's quite as much of an individual failure to admit that they are lonely within the marriage, now.</p>
        <p>Bergmann: There is a much stronger agenda of each partner than I think there used to be. They are trying to negotiate it between the two, but the agendas are much more definite. And I would say to your same-gender couples -- of which I have had only two examples over the years, but they're important -- I think part of their determination to make it is also ideological: to prove that homosexuality is not a disease, that it can be linked to a permanent relationship. And that, of course, can add to the stability.</p>
        <p>Bloom: That may be what drives the heterosexual couples as well.</p>
        <p>Bergmann: But they don't have so much to prove it, you see.</p>
        <p>Bloom: That's not clear to me anymore.</p>
        <p>Q: I have a question that's far off topic: How and to what extent do religious issues or concerns arise in the therapeutic context?</p>
        <p>Person: They come up in terms of the degree of someone's faith and the degree to which that faith may conflict with their wish to change their lives in any way. And it's harder for people who belong to certain faiths to enter into therapy for fear of violating some tenet of that faith.</p>
        <p>Talbott: The Group for the Advancement of Psychiatry asked the readers of Dear Abby: If you have suffered from schizophrenia, what was the most important factor in your recovery? We got hundreds of responses. To us, the single most striking factor was the role of their own religion and spirituality. They felt, rightly or wrongly, that a spiritual connection, the ability to believe that they were going to be better through a higher power, was the most important thing. And it was really astounding to the scientists who were looking at this, because we had expected answers like medication or psychotherapy.</p>
        <p>Bergmann: It doesn't surprise me. The ability to believe is a kind of a human capacity to create within yourself the image of somebody caring for you. And that image then does something for you. So that it's really a kind of a miraculous capacity to imagine a love object and then the love object, which has been imagined, is actually helpful.</p>
        <p>Bloom: I have certainly had more people talk about their spiritual advisers and their spiritual counselors than I did when I first started practicing. People seem to take for granted that their religious leader is also available to offer some sort of counseling service.</p>
        <p>Lear: There's again a general theme in which this fits, which is the possibility of living with certain kinds of intimacy. It's not just intimacy about people; it's an intimacy with certain kinds of ideals. Again, I think the ironic relationship to ideals is collapsing, and I think religious ideals are one example of that phenomenon. It's part of the wider phenomenon.</p>
        <p>Q: So it's now possible to talk about spiritual issues and financial issues in a psychotherapeutic context. To what extent do disappointed expectations come up in the kinds of concerns that patients discuss in therapy? Is that a theme?</p>
        <p>Person: Yes, there are disappointed expectations in their lives. I think one of the common ones now is that people who are very ambitious and make lots of money are very disappointed in the quality of their lives. It has cost them too much in other areas. They come into treatment because of the emptiness that they feel.</p>
        <p>Bergmann: I agree. I think, Who comes to us? Always people for whom something expected did not happen. It's almost by definition prerequisite for coming to us. I think the whole enormous increase in psychotherapy after World War II was to a certain extent based on the question: After the refrigerator, after car, after washing machine, what's next? Because these things were endowed with magic that they could not deliver.</p>
