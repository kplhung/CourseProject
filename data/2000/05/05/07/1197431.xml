        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>After reading Anthony Walton's article about ''Settin' the Woods on Fire'' [''In Making Myths, Betraying Our Past,'' April 23], I felt compelled to respond. I believe Mr. Walton missed the entire point of the film. The story of George Wallace is a record of a man who craved power more then anything else, and if his pursuit of power made him defend the poor blacks and whites of Alabama as a judge, or vilify and persecute the black population of Alabama as governor, than that is exactly what he would do. Power was his aim, not hatred.</p>

        <p>After reading Anthony Walton's article about ''Settin' the Woods on Fire'' [''In Making Myths, Betraying Our Past,'' April 23], I felt compelled to respond. I believe Mr. Walton missed the entire point of the film. The story of George Wallace is a record of a man who craved power more then anything else, and if his pursuit of power made him defend the poor blacks and whites of Alabama as a judge, or vilify and persecute the black population of Alabama as governor, than that is exactly what he would do. Power was his aim, not hatred.</p>
        <p>As to Mr. Watson's claim that Mr. Wallace was ''not very good at chasing the presidency,'' in Mr. Wallace's campaigns in 1968 and 1972 he steadily rose in the polls. As a young man during this time I vividly remember the wide-reaching popularity of his conservative views, even in my hometown of New York. The fact that Mr. Watson can, with a straight face, blame a high school altercation between black and white teenagers on Wallace's views and pronouncements says a whole lot more about him and his views than Wallace's. Until he can see the truth about men like Wallace -- that the amount of power available to elected officials in this nation is so massive that it will drive people to extraordinary actions to achieve it -- he will be relegated to the mass of citizenry who will be fooled again in the future.</p>
