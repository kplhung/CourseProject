        <p>THE SETTING -- A mixed crowd showed up at Spoiled Brats Grooming Salon Monday night for a party celebrating the publication of ''When Pets Come Between Partners.'' Mixed in this case meant four-legged and two-legged. Dr. Joel Gavriele-Gold, the psychoanalyst who wrote the book, mingled with friends and fans in the tiny pet store, which was crammed with pet supplies and party platters. Bottles of wine chilled on ice in grooming tubs in the back room.</p>
        <p>THE BUZZ -- Pepper, a gray schnauzer, barked excitedly as his owner, Nikki Moustaki, a 29-year-old book editor, tugged at his leash and discussed the men that had gone by the wayside in her life. ''You have to like my dog if you want to go out with me,'' she said, as Pepper jumped up on a woman with a leopard scarf, practically knocking the wine glass out of her hand. ''I've gotten rid of three guys in the initial stages because they just didn't hit it off.''</p>

        <p>THE SETTING -- A mixed crowd showed up at Spoiled Brats Grooming Salon Monday night for a party celebrating the publication of ''When Pets Come Between Partners.'' Mixed in this case meant four-legged and two-legged. Dr. Joel Gavriele-Gold, the psychoanalyst who wrote the book, mingled with friends and fans in the tiny pet store, which was crammed with pet supplies and party platters. Bottles of wine chilled on ice in grooming tubs in the back room.</p>
        <p>THE BUZZ -- Pepper, a gray schnauzer, barked excitedly as his owner, Nikki Moustaki, a 29-year-old book editor, tugged at his leash and discussed the men that had gone by the wayside in her life. ''You have to like my dog if you want to go out with me,'' she said, as Pepper jumped up on a woman with a leopard scarf, practically knocking the wine glass out of her hand. ''I've gotten rid of three guys in the initial stages because they just didn't hit it off.''</p>
        <p>Looking hesitantly around, she lowered her voice and added: ''Pepper has peed on the shoes of two guys that spent the night at my house. It was a sign. I knew right then we'd probably have an issue on our hands.''</p>
        <p>Yelps, barks and meows were part of the din. In one corner, near stacks of cans of a pet food called Science Diet, two people heatedly discussed a parrot who had led to the breakup of a three-year relationship for some people they knew.</p>
        <p>One of the two, Jeff Barnard, said curtly, ''I had a relationship end because the guy refused to sleep in bed with my dog.''</p>
        <p>''He was afraid of the dog,'' he added, as his hot-tempered Jack Russell terrier, also named Pepper, yapped loudly as more guests arrived. ''The bed thing is a biggie.''</p>
        <p>Catherine Newsom, a dog fancier, laughed. ''No dogs in bed at my house,'' she said. ''I'd have to have two king-sized beds.'' she said her three Bernese mountain dogs, Mimi, Trudy and La Diva, had gotten used to sleeping alone.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gavriele-Gold told of a woman with commitment issues whose boa constrictor became the wedge between her and her many boyfriends. ''Once they found out they had to bathe with the boa, they didn't stick around too long,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mo Rum, the owner of the grooming salon, shook his head. ''When it comes down to a lover or a pet, the pet always wins,'' he said, as the two Peppers jumped over each other to greet a pit bull named Stella. ''How often do you hear about people breaking up with their pets?''</p>
