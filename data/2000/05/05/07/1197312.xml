        <p>NO tourist destination is more loved and more reviled than Venice, and especially when it comes to food. The creatures of the Venetian lagoon in the hands of an expert chef are as memorable as they are rare, but most visitors to La Serenissima, trapped in the world of mass tourism or deterred by appalling prices at the top end, come away with the impression that Venetian food is not very good and way overpriced.</p>
        <p>On a February weekend, my companion, Franco, and I scouted for the great food we knew Venice could offer.</p>
        <p>On the ecclesiastical and social calendar this was the beginning of Carnival; on the gastronomic calendar it was the beginning of soft-shell crabs, slightly ahead of castraure, the local small wild artichokes, and still in full radicchio season. In seven years since our last visit, our two favorite restaurants, not always the household names they are today, had been lauded in the press with considerable hyperbole; intimations that praise had turned their heads had begun to circulate. We wanted to see whether they were still as good as we remembered (they were) and try others we had missed. Our criteria were simple: local ingredients, fair prices and tranquil surroundings. With one irresistible exception, we steered clear of the expensive hotel restaurants, and enjoyed several delicious meals in good restaurants that are admired by the dwindling local population.</p>
        <p>Osteria da Fiore</p>
        <p>Hyperbole? If we had spent five hours on a train from Rome in the morning and returned the same afternoon, our lunch here would have been worth the trip. This is a small, serious, modern, high-toned restaurant (with a Michelin star); its recently renovated elegant dining room lies behind the facade and front room of an old osteria, or wine shop. An enormous staff of pleasant young men in dinner jackets back up Maurizio Martin, the co-owner (his wife, Mara, is the chef), in the dining room. The menu is all seafood from the Venetian lagoon, and specific provenance is often noted on the menu. The cooking style is traditional Venetian taken to the nth degree of refinement with bursts of artistry.</p>
        <p>After a stuzzichino (amuse-bouche) of soft white polenta, zucchini and schie -- miniature shrimps cooked and eaten whole -- came the quintessentially Venetian antipasto, baccala mantecato, three divinely creamy scoops of stockfish (air-dried cod, not salt) flaked and beaten with olive oil until it can be spread, served with toasted polenta slices. Another antipasto was three perfect scallops presented in their shells and sprinkled with fresh thyme; it was like tasting both flavors for the first time.</p>
        <p>For the pasta course, I had another exciting interpretation of an old favorite, bigoli in salsa, whole-wheat spaghetti with onions cooked to a creamy sweetness with sardines that slowly disintegrate into a richly flavored sauce.</p>
        <p>Tagliolini with scampi (langoustines) and radicchio di Chioggia (which comes in a round head and is less bitter than the more celebrated radicchio di Treviso) were baked, which gave a rich texture but none of the heaviness of a pasta al forno.</p>
        <p>Franco's grilled eel from the island of Burano, skinned after cooking, was lean but unutterably tender. My involtini di triglie con radicchio di Treviso could have been a painting, a study in red: fillets of red mullet wrapped around chopped radicchio di Treviso leaves (the highly prized bitter long-leafed variety).</p>
        <p>Although extensive wine lists are rare in Venice because of the logistical difficulties of storage (or of doing anything underground), the Martins do have a good list, emphasizing regional labels. We drank the excellent house Soave Classico Superiore Pieropan 1998 ($17.50, at 2,000 lire to the dollar).</p>
        <p>Our desserts, too, were thrilling interpretations of traditional ones:  an exquisite cake called pinza, a sort of firm custard studded with raisins for flavor in a crust served with cold zabaglione as a sauce, and cremini fritti, delicious deep-fried cubes of custard.</p>
        <p>Al Covo</p>
        <p>To add to the already cheery atmosphere of this charmer founded 14 years ago by Cesare and Diane Benelli, some people came to Saturday dinner during Carnival in costume. A foyer with service bar separates the two simple, comfortable dining rooms (one nonsmoking), where Mrs. Benelli, who is American, assisted by solicitous waiters describes the menu's offerings, mostly superb local seafood.</p>
        <p>There is frequently a nonfish option too. Cesare Benelli, the chef, modestly describes his cooking style as doing as little as possible to the best ingredients.</p>
        <p>The antipasto of spider crab salad was shredded crabmeat replaced in its large red and white shell. It was served at just the right temperature, not too cold, and its predominant flavor was crab-perfection.</p>
        <p>Refinement and subtlety defined the pasta we tried -- tagliolini (very thin noodles) with oysters and scorfano (red rascasse, a scary-looking  fish with tender white flesh), in light, delicate but paradoxically rich sauce based on the broth of the scorfano, all sprinkled with fine parsley. The nonfish pasta e fagioli was a velvety,  flavorful puree of cranberry beans with fresh fettuccine and a small slice of musetto (cotechino) sausage.</p>
        <p>A tempura-style fritto misto, light as a feather, was enough to share as a main course with a salad of soft, young mixed greens. In addition to a multitude of perfect shrimps and scampi, the fritto contained a few vegetables, such as radicchio di Treviso, and two of the lagoon's most cherished morsels, namely, a small soft-shell crab, moleca, the first of the season, and two ethereal lagoon scallops, canestrelli.</p>
        <p>How can anything so delicate have so much flavor?</p>
        <p>Our wine, Gambellara I Masieri D.O.C. 1998 ($9.50), was a bargain from a good list.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Benelli is also the deservedly renowned dessert chef. Her semifreddo (molded ice cream) drenched in grappa and covered with small raisins was accompanied by a brittle  made of almonds and pine nuts. The torta di pere e prugne, pear and plum pie, was another treasure.</p>
        <p>Antica Trattoria Furatola</p>
        <p>Known to connoisseurs as a serious fish place, this spruce little restaurant with an unprepossessing facade  keeps a low profile. After a cramped anteroom, with one little table and a service bar, comes a single long room with low ceilings and white walls, old photos and copper pots and pans and an open kitchen. On a Saturday at lunch, it was practically empty despite crowds thronging the city.</p>
        <p>Our excellent seafood antipasto came in two stages, the delicate boiled version, bolliti, first and the more strongly flavored marinated version, marinati, second. The first included octopus, mantis shrimp (canocchia), ordinary shrimp and the tiny brown shrimp called schie locally, as well as subtly flavored white cuttlefish roe, which we had to have identified for us. Despite the inclusion of geographically irrelevant salmon and sun-dried tomatoes, the second half was delicious too: marinated anchovies, called sardoni locally, and sardines (sarde) in saor, fried then marinated, were delicious and very typical.</p>
        <p>What I really wanted next was spaghetti with mantis shrimp, but I allowed Franco and the waiter to talk me into spaghetti with sugo della casa, dark rich fish sauce with a little tomato and a lot of squid, fish pieces and schie parts. The portion was enormous, but came with the reassurance that I needn't feel obliged to eat it all. Franco's fish soup was in the same key, made on a similar base, and we felt that while both were good, we'd have been happier with the mantis shrimp. A very nice grilled coda di rospo (monkfish) followed; we were glad we had insisted on sharing it.</p>
        <p>The wine list is limited but adequate; we tried Incrocio Manzoni Vitigno 6.0.13 (yes, that is its name, derived from an agricultural experiment) Colli Trevigiani I.G.T. Gregoletto from the Veneto ($11.50), though a crisper wine would have suited the food better.</p>
        <p>Large glasses of sgroppino, liquid lemon sherbet to cleanse the palate, appeared next. In an assortment of desserts that followed, the best was an excellent crostata, or tart, of mixed fruit.</p>
        <p>Fiaschetteria Toscana</p>
        <p>We tried this highly recommended  Venetian classic on a weekday evening with two American friends. We found superb service, excellent ingredients, but somewhat hit-or-miss cooking. The dullness of the apparently unplanned decor of the upstairs main dining room was enlivened by exuberant glass sconces laden with glass fruits.</p>
        <p>The antipasti were good: sole in saor was the typical sweet and sour treatment applied to tasty fried sole fillets, layered with onions and succulent raisins; the excellence of the crab salad was marred by its chilly temperature; raw small scampi, shelled, were perfect. Risotto with carletti (a wild green called silene in English) for two was fine but too subtly flavored to go the distance in such a large portion. Franco's gnocchi with scampi and zucchini were livelier. A nice grilled monkfish was slightly overcooked by any standard, and severely overcooked for our friend from New York, who had begged to have it practically raw -- not to Italian taste.</p>
        <p>Had the monkfish been pulled off the grill a minute sooner, my frittura la Serenissima might have reached me just that much warmer. Nevertheless, it was a lovely superbly deep-fried mess of zucchini strips, artichoke wedges and shrimp, scampi and moscardini (tiny octopus); it also earned me a souvenir plate (given by the restaurant association I Ristoranti del Buon Ricordo to diners who order a specific dish). This was fry for sissies -- no heads, no shells.</p>
        <p>Franco's fritto misto, for true connoisseurs, included no vegetables, no souvenir plate, but plenty of whole small fish -- the works -- and it was even better than mine.</p>
        <p>An unusually lengthy and interesting wine list emphasizes the Veneto and neighboring regions. Since we wanted a light red, which our guests preferred to white, we chose a Zeni novello di Teroldego I.G.T. 99, from Trentino ($13).</p>
        <p>Homemade sfogliatine (puff pastries), some filled with whipped cream (much loved in Venice), were a delightful conclusion.</p>
        <p>Vini da Gigio</p>
        <p>In an enticing air of rusticity and informality, this friendly restaurant serves about 40 in its two low-ceilinged rooms (one nonsmoking). Unusually for Venice restaurants, the wines are a bigger attraction than the food. Our Rosso del Veronese Brolo di Campofiorin Masi 1995 ($25) was a rich and velvety Valpolicella.</p>
        <p>The simple but good seafood antipasto consisted of boiled octopus, mantis shrimp, shrimp and cuttlefish eggs, tepid and dressed only with olive oil, as well as baccala mantecato and toasted polenta. Deserting the lagoon, we then shared ravioli filled with puree of winter squash, sauced with a zabaglione of melted taleggio cheese, that was tasty, as were our simple main courses. These were the classic fegato alla veneziana, small pieces of liver sauteed with onions accompanied by slices of toasted polenta, and half a local roast duck, which was hearty and flavorful.</p>
        <p>For dessert a crostata of thin pear slices and whipped white robiola cheese was exquisite.</p>
        <p>Cip's Club</p>
        <p>By noon on Sunday, Carnival was under way. A cat can look at a king, and for the price of even a light lunch, the harried visitor can step aboard the Cipriani Hotel's private launch to the luxurious complex on Giudecca, the island facing San Marco.</p>
        <p>The hotel's main restaurant, by all accounts superb, was still closed for the winter, like the hotel itself. Only Cip's, which passes for the hotel's informal (sort of cashmere instead of silk) dining room, is open for most of the year. Small, square and bright, the dining room is cleverly designed to convey an impression of coziness without making you elbow your neighbor. As soon as the weather is warm enough, tables are set on a deck outdoors with a view toward San Marco that is worth at least half the considerable price of the lunch.</p>
        <p>The patrons at our Sunday meal included a table of Americans, a French couple and the rest Italian, some local. Everyone received the same deferential and highly professional service. While not large, the menu is intelligently composed to offer something for everybody without straying very far from local ingredients and dishes, except to the extent of offering a pizza menu too.</p>
        <p>An antipasto of just-cooked mantis shrimp draped elegantly over soft mesclun with a little balsamic vinegar was delicious, and a microcosm of the whole show: local basics, international high-level presentation, with a little something expensive and completely superfluous (the balsamico), because the customers might not understand leaving well enough alone. Our shared pasta, tagliatelle with Gorgonzola and radicchio di Treviso,  was braver: nothing much added to the two basic ingredients, so the dish was wonderfully rich and assertive but never heavy. Fegato alla veneziana again, thin and tender, and a turbot fillet garnished with small vegetables; its rhomboid shape evoked the Italian name of the fish (rombo) but was the only element in our lunch that reminded us we were in a hotel.</p>
        <p>Dessert was Cippamisu -- the definitive tiramisu, not substantially different from the norm except in its compact cylindrical shape, just better. Our superb, flavorful white Breganze di Breganze Maculan 1998 from the Veneto was at $28 the least expensive bottle on the brief but choice list.</p>
        <p>We left the peace of Giudecca and the exhilaration of San Marco and returned to Rome. Never mind the hats and masks: from now on for us Carnival in Venice will evoke the delicate creatures of the Venetian Lagoon.</p>
        <p>Bill of fare</p>
        <p>It is a measure of the importance of foreign tourists to the local economy that many restaurants in Venice do have no-smoking sections. Be aware, however, that if you choose to sit there, you may find yourself dining with a greater proportion of foreigners than Italians.</p>
        <p>Prices are for a meal for two with either a house wine or a bottle from the low end of the list. Credit cards are accepted except as noted.</p>
