        <p>Voices on Their Own</p>
        <p>Two summers ago, Erik Paul and Edward Thompson founded Modus VIII, a group of eight men and women trained in a cappella music of the 15th and 16th centuries. They will perform today at 4 p.m. at the Assumption Church, 99 Riverside Avenue in Westport. ''This music,'' said Mr. Thompson, who is director of music at the Unitarian Church, also in Westport, ''creates a feeling within you that is very profound and centering.''</p>
        <p>Today's program traces the life of Mary, beginning with ''Nativitas Tue,'' by Palestrina, celebrating her birth. The annunciation is highlighted in Lasso's ''Magnificat'' and the story unfolds with Josquin's ''Stabat Mater.'' Additional selections include Gregorian chant, a composition for male voices and another for sopranos and altos. Tickets are $10, $5 for people 18 and under. Call (203) 222-7070 for reservations.</p>

        <p>Longhouse and More</p>
        <p>Visitors to the Institute for American Indian Studies in Washington will be rewarded with three new exhibitions, in addition to the permanent collections and displays of art, artifacts and an entire Indian longhouse.</p>
        <p>The first is called ''Canoe and Shelter Construction Along the Farmington and Connecticut Rivers: Stone Woodworking Tools of the Tunxis, Sicaog and Related Tribes.'' It features a recently acquired collection of axes, gouges, adzes, celts and other tools excavated in the vicinity of Farmington and never before exhibited. It will remain on view through June 30.</p>
        <p>Mary L. Fletcher, an educator at the institute, has provided the contents of the second exhibition; it is titled ''Northeastern Birds: Legends and Lore.'' Twenty-five of her watercolor and gouache paintings of common Northeastern birds are accompanied by stories based on early Native American stories about each bird.</p>
        <p>When the show closes on May 28 it will become the institute's first traveling exhibition.</p>
        <p>''Windows into the Sacred: The Work of Father John B. Giuliani,'' a collection of iconic paintings that puts Jesus, Mary and other Christian figures into a Native American context, is the third exhibition, remaining through May 26. Father Giuliani lives the monastic life at the Benedictine Grange in Redding, where he has been painting sacred figures in acrylics on gessoed wood panels since 1990.</p>
        <p>Admission to the institute, at 38 Curtis Road, is $4, $2 for children 6 through 16, and includes access to all exhibitions. Visiting hours are Monday through Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., Sunday from noon to 5. Call (860) 868-0518 for more information or directions.</p>
        <p>Men on Their Toes</p>
        <p>Les Ballets Trockadero de Monte Carlo have been causing audiences to rock with laughter since 1974 and the group shows no signs of backing off.</p>
        <p>Until you have sat through a performance of the all-male, toe-shoed and tutu'd company, you cannot imagine what can be done with a plie or an extension. They will give a performance on Saturday at 8 p.m. in the Regina A. Quick Center for the Arts at Fairfield University.</p>
        <p>Men on point still baffle some American audiences, no matter that Russian dancers have been doing so as a matter of course. The Trocks are deft, graceful and wickedly comedic, still somehow managing to preserve the essence of ''Swan Lake'' or ''Giselle'' or whichever Balanchine, Graham or Duncan classic they have pounced on.</p>
        <p>Tickets are $28, $33 and $38, and may be reserved by calling (203) 254-4010. The university is on Benson Road in Fairfield.</p>
        <p>Serious Gardeners Invited</p>
        <p>There will not be a single marigold, impatiens, salvia, or other such ordiniary plant for sale at the Bartlett Arboretum's fair on Saturday. This event is for the serious gardener seeking an abelmoschus manihot, a zelkova sinica, a rare conifer, evergreen, an unusual ground cover, perennial or collection of wildflowers.</p>
        <p>Help in selecting from a variety of hard-to-find plants will be available through a group of Connecticut Master Gardeners, arboretum staff and volunteers. Plants suitable for containers are a special focus of this year's sale, along with a range of containers.</p>
        <p>The 63-acre arboretum is at 151 Brookdale Road and admission is free. The sale is from 10 to 4, with a rain date of next Sunday from noon to 4 p.m. For more information or directions call (203) 322-6971.</p>
        <p>Gay Men's Chorus</p>
        <p>The Connecticut Gay Men's Chorus holds its Spring Fling musical performance, wine-tasting and silent auction today from 2 to 6 at Edgerton Park Carriage House in New Haven. Tickets at the door are $25.</p>
        <p>All day Saturday, and on Mother's Day until 4 p.m., the group will deliver gift baskets and live serenades to moms all over the state for $50 to $75, depending on the size and contents of the basket. Call (800) 644-2462 to arrange for delivery.</p>
        <p>Dogwood in Bloom</p>
        <p>Dr. Isaac Benson would be amazed at what has happened to his place on in Fairfield over the past 200 years. The good doctor, a surgeon during the Revolutionary War, transplanted a few dogwoods from the surrounding woods onto his property on Greenfield Hill, a practice then followed by some of his neighbors.</p>
        <p>By 1895 the trees had multiplied to a point where the village picked up on the idea and introduced pink dogwoods around the town. In 1936 a little bazaar was set up by the women of the Greenfield Hill Church during blooming time, and today Fairfield has 50,000 pink and white dogwoods -- a canopy formed by thousands of them can be seen at the church and on surrounding properties.</p>
        <p>On Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., next Sunday from noon to 5, and May 15 and 16 from 10 to 3:30, the 65th Annual Dogwood Festival will be in progress on the church grounds at Old Academy and Bronson Roads.</p>
        <p>There will be antique appraisals on Saturday only, conducted by Peter Curran of the ''Antiques Roadshow'' on PBS, but the rest of the attractions will be ongoing. They include an art show and sale; sales of annuals, perennials, dogwood trees, and herbs; a juried craft show, a cafe with soup, baked goods and beverages; a hot dog tent, tag sale, children's games and crafts, musical programs, walking tours of the dogwoods and the neighborhood, and even a garden for sitting and relaxing.</p>
        <p>Admission and parking are free. To get there take Exit 21 from Interstate 95 or Exit 44 from the Merritt Parkway. Call (203) 259-5596 for more information.</p>
