        <p>Curt Schilling scattered 11 hits for his 100th career victory and Philadelphia stopped Atlanta's home winning streak, blanking the Braves, 6-0, last night.</p>
        <p>The Braves set a franchise record by winning 12 in a row at Turner Field, including a thrilling 6-5 victory over the Phillies the previous night when Andruw Jones hit a two-run homer in the ninth.</p>
        <p>There was no comeback against Schilling (1-1), making his second start since coming off the disabled list following shoulder surgery. He didn't allow a hit through the first three innings, then stranded 10 runners the rest of the way for his 14th career shutout.</p>
        <p>The Braves had two hits in the fourth, sixth and seventh innings, then loaded the bases in the ninth with three singles. Each time, Schilling made the big pitch to escape trouble, striking out Andres Galarraga on three pitches to end the game. The last of his 125 pitches was a 96 mile-an-hour fastball.</p>
        <p>Schilling struck out nine, walked only one and benefited from two double plays.</p>
        <p>The Phillies scored three runs in the second against Kevin Millwood (3-1), who had won nine straight decisions dating back to Aug. 8.</p>
        <p>Desi Relaford had a double before Doug Glanville came through with a two-out, two-run double that one-hopped the wall in right.</p>
        <p>CARDINALS 3, REDS 1: J.D. Drew hit a two-run homer in the seventh and Darryl Kile's history of struggling in Cincinnati ended as the St. Louis Cardinals beat the host Reds.</p>
        <p>Drew's fifth homer off Rob Bell (2-2) broke open a matchup of stingy starters. Kile (6-1) allowed five hits in six and two-thirds innings for his fourth straight victory but only the second of his career in Cincinnati.</p>
        <p>Heading into the game, Kile was 1-4 with a 6.83 earned run average in eight games at Cinergy Field. He was 3-7 over all and hadn't beaten the Reds since July 5, 1997.</p>
        <p>EXPOS 3, BREWERS 2: Even when he pitches well, Steve Woodard just can't win.</p>
        <p>Chris Widger's two-out double off reliever David Weathers in the eighth inning scored Terry Jones and gave visiting Montreal the victory over Milwaukee.</p>
        <p>Woodard, 0-7 in 16 starts since beating Kansas City by 2-0 last July 19, left with a 2-1 lead after seven innings, but Weathers (1-1) allowed two runs in the eighth.</p>
        <p>Woodard took a six-hit shutout into the seventh before Orlando Cabrera's two-out homer into the left-field corner.</p>
        <p>PIRATES 11, CUBS 9: With Pittsburgh trailing by four runs in the ninth inning, Brian Giles hit a two-run single, and Kevin Young, Wil Cordero, Pat Meares and Mike Benjamin all had runs batted in as the visiting Pirates rallied past the Cubs.</p>
        <p>Kyle Farnsworth (1-4) gave up two runs on three hits.</p>
        <p>Jeff Wallace (2-0) gave up one hit in the eighth inning. Mike Williams pitched the ninth for his fifth save.</p>
        <p>GIANTS 6, ROCKIES 0: Shawn Estes scattered nine hits and Jeff Kent went 3 for 3 with a triple and two runs scored as host San Francisco shut out Colorado for the second straight day.</p>
        <p>The Giants have won six straight and are 12-2 following a  4-11 start.</p>
        <p>Colorado, which led the majors with a .300 batting average coming in, has been blanked in consecutive games for the first time since starting play in 1993. The Rockies had scored 72 runs in their previous six games before the series.</p>
        <p>Estes (2-1) retired the side in order just twice, but worked out of jams to win his second straight start.</p>
        <p>DIAMONDBACKS 10, PADRES 5: Erubiel Durazo extended his hitting streak to 10 games with a home run and a double as host Arizona beat San Diego.</p>
        <p>Jay Bell had two hits, including a two-run single as the Diamondbacks scored six runs off Rodrigo Lopez (0-1) in the second inning. The pinch-hitter Greg Colbrunn had a two-run double in the eighth.</p>
        <p>Ed Sprague was 4 for 4 with two home runs for the Padres.</p>
