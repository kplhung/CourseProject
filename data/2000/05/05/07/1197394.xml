        <p>SO I thought I'd tell you about my trip to Las Vegas,'' Lillian Vernon told the children gathered around her. Ms. Vernon, the grande dame of catalog sales, was the speaker for ''Take Your Child to Work Day,'' and about 20 children were gathered in her elegant office.</p>

        <p>SO I thought I'd tell you about my trip to Las Vegas,'' Lillian Vernon told the children gathered around her. Ms. Vernon, the grande dame of catalog sales, was the speaker for ''Take Your Child to Work Day,'' and about 20 children were gathered in her elegant office.</p>
        <p>Ms. Vernon told the children that everything was expensive in Las Vegas. (''A soda will cost you five bucks.'') She described the beautiful ceiling in the hotel she stayed in (''It cost $5 million to make.'') and the different shows she saw, and then Ms. Vernon told them a little about gambling.</p>
        <p>''A friend of ours won $55,000, but he only cashed in half of it, because after that you have to report to the government how much money you won, so he went home and he's going to play again,'' Ms. Vernon said. ''So do you have questions about Las Vegas? Do you want to go?''</p>
        <p>Maybe it wasn't the most traditional way to expose children to the world of work. But it was vintage Lillian Vernon -- neither sentimental nor patronizing -- and finances came first.</p>
        <p>The 72-year-old entrepreneur, who parlayed a $2,000 investment into a mail order business that took in more than $241 million in revenues last year, was both relaxed and collegial with the employees' children who came to visit the company. Perfectly coiffed and wearing a beige dress, Mrs. Vernon answered the children's questions with business-like brevity.</p>
        <p>''How many employees did you start with?''</p>
        <p>''One. Myself,'' Mrs. Vernon said.</p>
        <p>''Who was the first employee you ever hired?''</p>
        <p>''BeBe. Somebody get BeBe up here. You can meet her.''</p>
        <p>(BeBe Limongelli, who began engraving orders in 1957 and now is a quality assurance coordinator for the company, was produced for the children.)</p>
        <p>''What was the first thing you sold?''</p>
        <p>''A bag and a belt.''</p>
        <p>''Why did you start your business?''</p>
        <p>''I wanted to make some money, and I was having a baby and I couldn't get a job in an office.''</p>
        <p>''How much money do you make?''</p>
        <p>''Good people don't talk about money. If you have it, you don't talk about it. If you don't have it, you don't want to talk about it.''</p>
        <p>For those unfamiliar with the Lillian Vernon entrepreneurial legend, she didn't have money, and then she did. In 1951, as a 24-year-old pregnant housewife, she started her mail order business from her kitchen table. Using the money she received as a wedding gift and a supply of purses and belts, she put a $495 advertisement in Seventeen Magazine, offering to personalize each order with the customer's initials free of charge. She promptly received $32,000 in orders, and her business was launched. Three years later, she published her first catalog. It was 16 pages long, in black and white.</p>
        <p>Today, the 49-year-old company publishes nine different specialty catalogs, which sell gifts, household, gardening, kitchen and children's products. In the last fiscal year the company received more than 4.7 million orders. Among the games that the children played the day they visited corporate headquarters here was ''Who Wants to Be a Lillian Vernon Millionaire?'' and ''Lillian Vernon Fortune.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Vernon, who is married to Paolo Martino, said she ''had raised'' two children and three husbands. Not only was she ahead of her time when she started her mail order business (long before mailboxes were jammed with catalogs from every company imaginable), but she was also prescient about ''Take Your Daughters to Work Day.''</p>
        <p>When her son, David C. Hochberg, who is vice president of public affairs at the company, proposed to his mother eight years ago that she invite the daughters of employees to honor the day, Ms. Vernon flatly refused to exclude boys. She said she believed the girls-only day was discriminatory. Today many corporations include both sons and daughters, but in 1992, Mr. Hochberg said it was considered so politically incorrect that at the time he kept the boys' attendance quiet.</p>
        <p>''Lillian was adamant that she would only do it if we included boys and as usual, she was amazingly ahead of her time,'' Mr. Hochberg said.</p>
