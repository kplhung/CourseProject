        <p>How old are you?</p>
        <p>As old as until now.</p>
        <p>Under the kelp-bed razorclams turning to find purchase.</p>
        <p>Young things shooting first-times and retaining precedence.</p>
        <p>Razors digging backwards and down, spurting spittle-bits of sea to equalize descent.</p>
        <p>Do you believe that after you die some part of you lives on?</p>
        <p>Do you pray in hope of reward?</p>
        <p>Do you agree or disagree with the following statement:</p>
        <p>it bothers me my life did not turn out as I expected.</p>
        <p>Also there are people on the beach.</p>
        <p>And wind accepted by waterfilm.</p>
        <p>Look: acceptance has a shape.</p>
        <p>And fate -- is it accepted by waterfilm?</p>
        <p>And how we must promise things.</p>
        <p>Do you pray in hope of reward.</p>
        <p>Do you pray without hope of reward.</p>
        <p>What is it has been gone a long time?</p>
        <p>How long is the slightest chance?</p>
        <p>Everything in sunlight improvising backwards, scratching phrases in a rapid jitter, where the mind above it begins, ends, tries to get up and move towards or away from.</p>
        <p>You'll feel the so-called music strut hard against the downsuck.</p>
        <p>Also someone's shadow going to purchase a beverage.</p>
        <p>Also everything in sunlight trying to become bodied by something else, the whole retreating ocean laying microscopic and also slightly larger fiercely lit kelp in streaks of action - long sentences with branchlike off-widths indicating acceleration brought forth and left-off, phrases of gigantic backing-off from a previously held shore, rivulets of sand left visible in raised inscription whitening where moistened -- questionlike -- algebraic - regarding the long leave-taking - We are ourselves walking to the right.</p>
        <p>The noon hour is itself always a firstness of something.</p>
        <p>Also, elsewhere, who is hungry?</p>
        <p>How small are they? How? I step on parts of faces, only parts. A whole face, what is that? From here it seems hard to make out, also a very empty thing. Like the border of a nationstate.</p>
        <p>Being comes into this, idles, over the interminable logic of manyness, the demand that something exist.</p>
        <p>Bending to look close, a spiking-up and forth of burrowings, channelings, a turning, a re-turning on itself where the broad nouns of large clamshells flayed open by the gulls lie in punctuating sunlit stillness on top of a thing which but for their stillness and expulsion has no top. The seagulls hurrying, dragging and retrieving. Also pecking in place and dropping and lifting. Sometimes stepping backwards in order to drag and loosen. Also the drag of the slantline downtilted towards ocean's sucking further still of streams of water towards itself. Of course the future wasn't there before at all.</p>
        <p>This all first time and then again first time.</p>
        <p>I feel reproach. Eyes closed I touch my face.</p>
        <p>My hand hovers like the very question of my face over my face.</p>
        <p>G says, breathing beside me, that firstness is not, in any case, a characteristic of experience.</p>
        <p>He speaks of the long chain back to the beginning of ''the world'' (as he calls it) and then, at last, to the great no beginning. I feel the no begin.</p>
        <p>Subsequence hums tinily all round me, erasing my tracks. Oh bright/morning. This morning.</p>
        <p>Look: what looks like retreating is not exactly so.</p>
        <p>Sunlight makes of exactness an issue.</p>
        <p>No issuing forth of matter because of sunlight. But sun's up-sucking also at work. And how it seems to have weight, pushing the originally pillowy kelp-beds down, flattening them where they give up water, unthickening their pastures as the tunneling-away from that gigantic drying drives the almost imperceptible downwards: first glitter then more unchangeable shine slowly being forced into the vast top of the beachwide beds. Drying out and hardening, the beds force light back.</p>
        <p>Back across what resides inside.</p>
        <p>White closed-in part of gazing-out.</p>
        <p>Bothered by the ease of touch.</p>
        <p>As if one should open out and spill, again.</p>
        <p>Sound in the sun now muted (is there inherent good) as the ruffling back-roar recedes (is there inherent good in people) - Sound becoming particular and pricked with syncopation of singularities - peeps, insucks, snaps -- where light is in domain.</p>
        <p>What good is my silence for, what would it hold inside, keeping it free.</p>
        <p>Sing says the folding water on stiller water - one running through where the other's breaking. Sing me something (the sound of the low wave-breaking) (the tuning-down where it deposits life-matter on the uphill of shore)(the multiplicity of deepenings and covering where whiteness rises as a manyness) (as the wave breaks over its own breaking) (to rip in unison onto its backside) - of something sing, and singing, disagree.</p>
