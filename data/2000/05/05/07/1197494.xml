        <p>For Sherry Wolkoff, it was an unsettling moment.</p>
        <p>''I turned on the television and all of a sudden I looked up and there was the sign crashing down,'' said Ms. Wolkoff.</p>
        <p>Her father had not owned the Admiral Bar and Grill for nearly 30 years. But when she saw the building demolished in the plan to convert the south side of the Admiral Wilson Boulevard into a park and a bicycle path, she herself felt crushed.</p>
        <p>''I knew they were doing it soon, but it was heart-rending nonetheless,'' she said. ''It was where I grew up. It was my father's life.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Wolkoff is probably in the minority.</p>
        <p>Languishing as a pornography-filled pathway to the state's poorest city, the two-mile-long stretch had become seriously run-down since the days when Ms. Wolkoff's father ran the bar and grill as a respectable business. Of late, it had been a go-go bar, suspected by some as a hangout for the prostitutes who were regularly arrested along the eight-lane strip of highway.</p>
        <p>Last year, Governor Whitman decided it was time to clean up the boulevard and pushed officials from the Delaware River Port Authority, the state and Camden County to start the $50 million Camden Gateway Project. The port authority was given the green light to purchase or condemn 44 properties on the south side of the boulevard along the Cooper River and erect a park with landscaped and wooded areas, a jogging and bike path and river overlooks.</p>
        <p>Though the boulevard has seen about $15 million of road and curb improvements over the last several months, the demolition last Tuesday and Wednesday of the Admiral Bar and Grill and two adjacent buildings -- a liquor store and a warehouse -- was seen as the real beginning of the Gateway Project.</p>
        <p>Jane M. Kenny, the state Community Affairs Commissioner, with a union operator at her side, rocked the claw of a huge crane  until the Admiral's two-story sign came crashing down. Ms. Kenny, who was filling in for an ailing Ms. Whitman, reiterated the governor's desire to have the south side of the boulevard cleared in time for the Republican National Convention, which will be held in Philadelphia in late July.</p>
        <p>''As soon as we demolish the properties, we will start grading sites and planting them,'' said a spokesman for Delaware River Port Authority, Joseph Diemer. ''We'll get grass growing to stabilize the landscaping. By the middle of the summer, there will be some serious green out there.''</p>
        <p>The boulevard, named for Henry Braid Wilson, a Camden native who once led the United States Naval Academy, was originally intended to be a parkway, but the Depression interceded. Eventually, it became a commercial strip with a bit of fun to it, a paean to the coming auto culture.</p>
        <p>The first drive-in movie in the country was put there in the early 1930's by Richard Hollingshead, a Camden auto-parts manufacturer. Nearby was the Whoopee-Coaster, a U-shaped hilly wooden structure on which you drove your car for a ''whoopee'' roller-coaster-like ride. Several car dealers planted themselves on the north side of the strip, which had at its center Olga's Diner. On the south side, service stations dotted the roadway -- one of which, a Merit station, claimed to be the largest in the world when it was built in the early 1950's. Billboards sat both high and low along the road.</p>
        <p>At the Camden end of the boulevard, Sears built its first ''suburban'' store with a parking lot. And at the far end, in Pennsauken, was the Airport Circle, the first traffic circle in the United States.</p>
        <p>But as real suburban development burgeoned and Camden fell into disrepair in the 1970's and 1980's, the Admiral Wilson Boulevard became increasingly tawdry. The grand YMCA built by the Johnson family, which started RCA in Camden, became the Oasis Motel, where rooms were let by the hour. The most distinctive building today is the Fantasy Showbar, a huge pornography haven that the port authority recently bought for $2.1 million.</p>
        <p>''We'll take possession of that June 1 and it will finally come down soon after,'' said Mr. Diemer. Not long after that the Merit station will be no more, and the billboards will be down by mid-June. The Sears building on the far end of the project might be saved by getting historic certification.</p>
        <p>Mr. Diemer said few were lamenting all this passing of history. ''Many of these properties were delinquent in taxes, so the loss in tax revenue is small,'' he said, noting that the state had allotted $250,000 to upgrade the properties on the north side of the boulevard, which could actually increase the Camden and Pennsauken tax base.</p>
        <p>Though the project will not be completed until spring of 2001, Mr. Diemer seemed confident that the buildings would be cleared and grass planted by the time the Republicans passed through town.</p>
        <p>But that doesn't mean very much to people like Ms. Wolkoff.</p>
        <p>''Do you really think anyone is going to use a bike path along a highway in Camden?'' she asked. ''People speeding along the Admiral Wilson Boulevard are not going to stop and say, 'How lovely!' ''</p>
