        <p>AS Robert Forester watched his dealer pull up in a black Chrysler PT Cruiser to take him for a test drive, he decided on the spot that the retro-looking small van would join his family's fleet.</p>
        <p>''I got in that PT Cruiser and fell in love,'' said Mr. Forester, who works for a printing and stationery business in Henderson, Tex., 150 miles east of Dallas.</p>
        <p>But two months after he ordered a red one with automatic transmission and tinted moonroof for his mother, Jean, it still has not arrived. In fact, it has not even been built, and Chrysler representatives could not tell him when it would be.</p>
        <p>With auto sales booming along with the economy, consumers who want the hottest vehicles are struggling to find the unfindable, which this spring includes eye-catchers like the PT Cruiser and the Toyota MR2 Spyder sports car, the highly rated Honda Odyssey minivan, and luxury vehicles like the BMW X5 sport utility and Mercedes S-Class sedans. Orders like Mr. Forester's go on waiting lists and languish for months.</p>
        <p>In some areas, it can be impossible even to find a vehicle to inspect in the showroom, because dealers are selling every one that comes in. Honda dealers on Long Island are telling customers who want to test-drive an Odyssey that they must first order one, put down a deposit, and then wait for it to arrive.</p>
        <p>In response, many consumers find that they must alter their tactics, searching by phone over wide areas for dealerships that have a car on the lot. A growing number of people are turning to the Internet, combing dealer sites, omnibus shopping sites like Autobytel and Microsoft's Carpoint, and even auction sites like eBay for leads.</p>
        <p>Tracking down a hot car is one thing; taking title is another. Joel Manby, a former executive with Saab and Saturn who is now president of Greenlight.com, a car-buying site, estimated that half of all buyers use the Internet to research or find vehicles, but that only one in 20 concludes a deal online.</p>
        <p>THE Internet also tends to lengthen the lines at the dealers who have hot cars on hand. Corky Jones, Internet sales manager for Covington Pike Chrysler in Memphis, said his dealership had 103 orders for PT Cruisers from people as far away as Ohio, Illinois and Texas. In one hour on Wednesday, six people came into the showroom to see the vehicle, with its vaguely 1930's front end; they were told that new orders would be filled in December.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones likened the demand to the frenzy last year over Volkswagen's New Beetle, which remains in short supply in some parts of the country. But he is enjoying the clamor. ''Just once in your life, you want to sell something that is so popular you have people lining up for it,'' he said. ''It's fantastic.''</p>
        <p>On the wall in Covington Pike's showroom is an ever-lengthening list of buyers who have put down $500 deposits. James Alexander, a mechanic from Mason, Tenn., who went on the list in February, just got his PT. ''It's a joy to drive,'' Mr. Alexander said.</p>
        <p>Despite having no bargaining leverage on such a hot vehicle, Mr. Alexander got his for the sticker price, about $20,000 with options, because Covington Pike has decided not to charge a premium. ''That wouldn't be fair to the customer,'' Mr. Jones said.</p>
        <p>But other dealers feel differently. Last week, anyone willing to pay $24,999 -- $5,000 above list -- could drive home that day in the dark blue PT Cruiser on the showroom floor at Village Chrysler-Jeep in Royal Oak, Mich. Village's new-car sales manager, Jeff Radke, said it had been bought used with a few hundred miles on the odometer; his waiting list for new ones numbers 60.</p>
        <p>And the dealership is not guaranteeing what the final price will be on those, he said, leaving open the possibility that it will tack on a premium if demand stays strong. And if customers balk? ''If they don't want it, they can cancel,'' he said. ''It's up to them.''</p>
        <p>Some dealers are looking to maximize profits on scarce vehicles by auctioning them online. Blouin Truck Center of Augusta, Me., posted a dark red PT Cruiser on eBay last week, seeking an opening bid of $19,990, or $2,400 above list. ''It's a variation on what the market will bear,'' said Mike Linkenbach, the dealership's manager. ''This is a unique vehicle. This isn't like a Dodge Neon that they build every day.''</p>
        <p>Steve Rossi, vice president for global communications at DaimlerChrysler, said such markups were isolated. ''You've heard a handful of stories,'' he said. ''What you haven't heard are the 10,000 positive experiences, people who went through the process, placed an order and got their vehicles.'' Chrysler dealers delivered 8,325 PT Cruisers in April, he said, and have about 79,000 more on order.</p>
        <p>IN introducing the X5, its first sport utility, in December, BMW found itself in the catbird seat. Jack Pitney, a spokesman, said, ''We're in an enviable position where demand far outweighs supply.''</p>
        <p>Too far, in fact. The first year's production is sold out, and dealers are not yet allowed to take orders for 2001 models. For now, the only way to get one is to buy it used; an X5 with 4,700 miles was on eBay last week at a minimum bid of $49,100, just $800 below its base price when new.</p>
        <p>So, too, with Toyota's new MR2, a two-seat sports car whose production was limited to generate buzz with consumers: all 7,425 available this year are spoken for, the company said. And at Betten Imports in Grand Rapids, Mich., the back-order time for the latest Mercedes S-Class cars, which start at around $80,000, is up to a year.</p>
        <p>The Odyssey has no such cachet; its attractions are Honda's reputation for quality and raves in the consumer press. Joseph Phillippi, automotive analyst at PaineWebber, observed, ''It's a Honda -- enough said.''</p>
        <p>Introduced more than a year ago, the Odyssey is still scarce, even though Honda is making as many as it can. ''Most dealers only have one or two,'' said Michael Luckey, an automotive consultant who shopped for an Odyssey in Pompton Plains, N.J. Mr. Manby of Greenlight.com, which matches potential buyers with 1,000 participating dealers, said it ''is tough to find anywhere.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the toughest of all, for now, is BMW's Z8 sports car, featured in ''The World Is Not Enough,'' last year's James Bond thriller. The car went on sale only last Monday, but all 400 to be sold in the United States have already been allotted to buyers who ordered them up to a year ago, when the Z8 began appearing in European car magazines. An Internet search last week found none on auction sites.</p>
        <p>In such cases, ''the advice I can give any customer is basically, 'Get to your dealer early,' '' said Steven Sturm, vice president for marketing at Toyota.</p>
        <p>What will be the next hot car? Analysts mention the Audi TT Roadster and the new Thunderbird that Ford is planning for next spring. Jeff Leckta, Internet Services Manager at Betten Imports, cites the convertible New Beetle. Though Volkswagen told dealers not to expect the car until the fall of 2001, he said, ''I already have orders.''</p>
