        <p>JEFFERY AND FAITH LARSEN of Greenwich, Conn., have been anticipating life in an empty nest, now that their children are 14 and 15 years old. So they have decided to move to a new nest. That nest, it turns out, will be an old one, a four-story town house on East 62nd Street built in 1870 and expanded to five stories in 1919.</p>
        <p>When the Larsens move in -- the target date is January -- they will join a small but impassioned band of city dwellers who are bringing town houses full circle back to their origins as single-family homes after decades of being subdivided into apartments. Projects like the Larsens' require stamina, determination -- and more than likely a great deal of money.</p>
        <p>Mr. Larsen, the chief executive of ICor Brokerage Inc., a four-month-old company that offers business-to-business online brokerage services, said that he paid more than $2 million for the house and estimated that the renovation costs would probably hit $1.5 million.</p>
        <p>Last month, 10 studio apartments in the building and a duplex that once housed an art gallery were demolished. In addition, the facade will be rebuilt to its original state, a step that has gotten the required approval of the Landmarks Preservation Commission.</p>
        <p>''It was really ugly, and now it will be really beautiful,'' Mr. Larsen said. ''I want to bring it back to the look and feel of a block in a historical district.''</p>
        <p>Restoring the house to exactly what it was in 1870 is an almost impossible task, though. ''Because a fifth floor was added, we can't make it look exactly is it did, so we must be innovative,'' Mr. Larsen said. ''We are putting on a mansard roof with two dormers.''</p>
        <p>That the Larsens have seized a rare opportunity is clear, but just how rare is impossible to measure.</p>
        <p>No definitive figures exist for the number of town houses in the city. A computer analysis of city property records by The New York Times, using descriptions that would suggest town houses, found 4,400 buildings in Manhattan and 15,200 in Brooklyn that fell within the parameters. Those figures were arrived at by counting the number of residential buildings of three to five stories on lots less than 25 feet wide. The buildings had no more than 12 units and were built before 1905, after which few town houses were constructed in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Other estimates vary widely. For example, figures taken from the city's Department of Finance by the Real Estate Board of New York put the total number in Manhattan at 1,386, a mere sliver of the borough's residential market, which includes 200,000 co-ops and 65,000 condominiums, according to the board's estimate. For Brooklyn, Steven Knobel, the executive vice president of Mitchell, Maxwell &amp; Jackson, an appraisal firm, said, ''Our guess is that there are somewhere around 45,000 town houses.''</p>
        <p>Last year, according to the Real Estate Board of New York, 145 town houses changed hands in Manhattan. The single-family town house is experiencing a something of a renaissance, a trend that has been accelerating in recent years, brokers say, bringing back a style of gracious living in buildings that don't soar to the sky and dwarf their neighbors.</p>
        <p>''For a time the single-family house in Manhattan became almost extinct,'' said Tim Desmond, a town house broker at Stribling &amp; Associates. ''In the 1920's, with the advent of big apartment buildings, apartment living came into vogue, and houses went out of favor. That left housing stock that was chopped up into 4 to 12 units.''</p>
        <p>Many of the apartments in buildings with three or more units were subject to rent control or rent stabilization, limiting the profits the landlord could reap. After 1986, they lost even more luster as investments, when federal tax laws were changed to significantly restrict their use as tax shelters. But other factors were emerging to make the single-family house a diamond on the market, although sometimes a diamond in the rough. Those factors include a soaring economy, a dwindling supply of large prewar co-ops and a growing resistance to what  some prospective buyers describe as the tyranny of co-op boards.</p>
        <p>''Now we are again in a gilded age in New York, but unlike the turn of the century, there is no vacant land, so people are reconverting these buildings,'' said Frederick W. Peters, the president of Ashforth Warburg Associates.</p>
        <p>Brokers say that their clients have numerous motives. ''With a different perception of safety in the city, people who might not have thought of doing it 10 years ago are today, and people who 10 years ago might not have been in a position to utilize the entire house are now,'' said George W. van der Ploeg, a vice president at Alice F. Mason Ltd.</p>
        <p>''We are seeing a trend toward larger, more opulent houses,'' he said. ''A town house is probably 5,000 square feet, bigger than most apartments, and that makes a statement. In addition, some people chafe at the concept of the co-op board having so much power, from approving the buyer to approving the renovation.''</p>
        <p>And, many brokers say, compared with the square footage of a co-op or condominium, a town house offers a bargain.</p>
        <p>''You get a lot more bang -- or space -- for the buck,'' said Barbara Fox, the president of the Fox Residential Group. ''Say you live in a 20-foot-wide house that is 60 feet deep. For five floors, that gives you 6,000 square feet. You would have to have an immense apartment to equal that. Plus you probably get a garden in the back, you may get a terrace, and you can improve the roof and have a sun deck. It is not cheap, but it is a lot cheaper than getting the same interior and exterior space in a co-op.''</p>
        <p>The trend seems to have no geographical limits. In Manhattan, houses are being snapped up on the East and West Sides, uptown and downtown, from Harlem to Greenwich Village.</p>
        <p>''There are no undesirable neighborhoods for this in Manhattan,'' Mr. Peters said, but he did agree that there are some blocks that command special attention. ''Notoriously, the most desirable street is 70th Street between Park and Lex. It is famous for some incredibly beautiful buildings.''</p>
        <p>In Brooklyn, where town houses have long been dominant in some neighborhoods, the market is surging as well. Brooklyn Heights, the oldest landmarked district in the country, commands the highest prices, $2 million to $3.5 million, said Christopher Thomas, a senior vice president and the sales director for William B. May in Brooklyn. ''And we are doing a lot of business in neighborhoods we didn't go into three years ago, like Fort Greene and Clinton Hill,'' he said. In Fort Greene houses are going for $700,000 to $1 million.</p>
        <p>Melinda Magnett, the president of the Corcoran Group in Brooklyn, said: ''Prices are soaring here, though they are nowhere near those in Manhattan. A vice president of Juno.com and his wife who are now renting on the Upper East Side are buying the first-ever million-dollar brownstone in Clinton Hill and converting it to a single-family.''</p>
        <p>The demand has led, not surprisingly, to bidding wars. Richard Steinberg, managing director of Ashforth Warburg, put a single-family house at 161 East 62nd Street on the market last month for $3,150,000. ''Within four hours I had three full-price offers,'' he said. ''We went to sealed bids and sold it over the asking price by $150,000.'' Should the deal fall through, he said he had two backup offers in hand.</p>
        <p>Mr. Steinberg is also the representative  for Premiere Properties of Manhattan, a company owned by a British investor, Michael Cannon.</p>
        <p>''He knew there was a shortage in the New York market of high-end single-family homes, so two years ago he decided to buy multiunit buildings as long as they could be delivered vacant, renovate them and resell them,'' Mr. Steinberg said. ''So far, he has done two, including a building on East 66th Street that he bought for $3,750,000 and sold for $7,250,000.''</p>
        <p>From the buyer's perspective, the single most critical consideration in the decision to convert a town house that contains four or more units is whether those apartment are occupied and whether they are rent-controlled or rent-stabilized.</p>
        <p>Tenants who are not protected by rent control or stabilization can be legally evicted at the end of their leases. To evict a rent-controlled tenant, the owner must obtain an order from the New York State Division of Housing and Community Renewal verifying the owner's compelling need for the apartment and then must start court proceedings.</p>
        <p>Stabilized tenants are protected, too, but Housing Court can authorize evictions at the end of the lease if the apartment is to be occupied by the owner or an immediate member of the family. People age 62 and over or people with disabilities may not be evicted from a stabilized apartment on the grounds of the owner's need for it unless the landlord provides a comparable apartment nearby at the same or lower rent.</p>
        <p>With all these conditions standing as potential barriers to the full conversion of a town house, many prospective buyers make it a condition of sale that the building be empty, and many sellers make payments to tenants to move.</p>
        <p>Steve Mark, a general contractor who bought a 10,000-square-foot mansion at 8 East 77th Street for himself and his family of six, did that when his bid on the building was accepted. ''When we bought it, it had three or four tenants, and our contract was subject to its being vacant,'' he said. ''We gave the seller six months and then could have broken the contract. There was one holdout, so we gave another three months, but they had to pay him $250,000.''</p>
        <p>H OUSES converted to single-family status by previous owners or ones that can be emptied by the sellers are worth significantly more than those with tenants in residence. Sara Gelbard, a senior vice president of the Corcoran Group who specializes in Greenwich Village, Chelsea and Gramercy Park, recently closed on a house in Chelsea with a duplex apartment and two floor-throughs for $1,750,000, a sum she described as unusually low. ''Two doors down there is a house on the market that has been renovated for single-family with an asking price of $2.6 million,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''My recommendation is never to buy anything with the intention of kicking people out,'' she added. ''Offer either to buy them another place or settle with them. You have to be creative.''</p>
        <p>She gave this example: ''Several years ago, I had an owner who bought co-ops for two tenants, relocated them and is allowing them to stay for life, and then he will own the apartments.''</p>
        <p>Even the wispiest of hints that a building may be for sale is likely to strike fear in the hearts of tenants.</p>
        <p>''We are getting more calls all the time over the issue of owner occupancy,'' said Michael McKee, associate director of the New York State Tenants &amp; Neighbors Coalition. ''We are seeing more and more eviction cases being brought against tenants in rent-regulated apartments in smaller buildings. Some of those times it's because landlords want to occupy the entire building and other times because they simply want to charge market rents.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McKee would like to see the laws amended so that rent-stabilized tenants would have the stronger protections rent-controlled tenants have, and he favors limiting the number of apartments a landlord can take over. ''That would make people safe in their own homes,'' he said. ''There are cases when the owners act in good faith and other times when they use occupancy as a ruse. They simply have a relative live there for a few months.''</p>
        <p>Although empty buildings fetch higher prices, there are still some owners who want -- or need -- the income generated from tenants to help carry the mortgage or provide a sense of security. And some brokers, Paul Massey, the president of Massey Knakal Realty Services, among them, contend that ''buying such a building is absolutely worth it.''</p>
        <p>''If you value a building with a stabilized tenant in it and you put a value on the same building were it to be empty, there is a huge leap in value that allows you to pay the tenant,'' he said. ''If there are three or four tenants, you get more of a break.''</p>
        <p>To illustrate: ''The average multiple-unit dwelling in the city sells for about $200 a square foot,'' he said, ''and the average single-family residence for $500 to $1,300 a square foot.''</p>
        <p>When San Orr, an investment banker, and his wife, Sarah, an owner of Babybox.com, a Web site that sells baby gifts, began looking for a town house last year in the Park Slope and Fort Greene, they considered renting out part of whatever they bought for the income it would generate.</p>
        <p>''Then we decided not to, because we found a house where we didn't need the rental income,'' said Mr. Orr. He would not divulge the price he paid for the house, which is in Fort Greene. ''We have two dogs, and we are expecting a baby in August,'' he added, ''and we wanted not to have to worry about people coming and going. We also felt that we would best be able to restore the initial character of the building in its entirety rather than just using one apartment.''</p>
        <p>Once a building is empty, the process of transforming it into a single-family residence can take a year or more.</p>
        <p>''Though in some ways it is more difficult to do a house than an apartment,'' said Mr. Mark, who has been the contractor on several town houses and is now doing his own,  ''logistically it is easier. You don't have to have the plans approved by the co-op board or the building's architect, only by the city. You can work 10 hours a day, not 5.''</p>
        <p>The scope of the project helps, too. ''In any renovation, the more you do, the easier it is,'' he said. ''Trying to make new work blend into existing conditions is the most difficult. If you totally gut a place, it may cost more and take more time, but it is less difficult.''</p>
        <p>But one buyer's difficulty may be another buyer's nightmare. Whenever he hears a building described as having ''good bones,'' Warren Pearl, a contractor who has been renovating town houses in Manhattan for 30 years, becomes suspicious.</p>
        <p>''Clients and architects say that all the time,'' he said, ''and what they don't realize is that they are all wrecks, simply because they were converted a long time ago, probably with improperly done structural modifications to accommodate all those kitchens and bathrooms.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pearl estimates a renovation will cost 50 percent of the purchase price. ''If you pay $6 million, it will cost approximately $3 million,'' he said. ''In terms of square footage, high-end residential jobs are about $300 to $400 per square foot.''</p>
        <p>Renovating town houses in New York City presents unique challenges. ''You have problems here you don't see anywhere else in the country,'' Mr. Pearl said. ''You have attached houses and sometimes one wall is not attached. Manhattan is filled with underground streams, which is why buildings often lean, and there are flooding problems people aren't even aware of.''</p>
        <p>Among the more serious flaws he encounters are joists damaged by walls, plumbing and electric lines added when the house was converted to apartments, and water damage from inadequately caulked bathtubs and leaky radiators and roofs. ''People don't understand the scope and extent of work that is necessary,'' he said.</p>
        <p>That certainly proved true for a woman who moved into a house on the East Side with her husband and three children in February. It was not until the building had been gutted during a year of construction work that they were told that the joists -- the beams that hold up floors and ceilings -- were collapsing.</p>
        <p>''The most important thing I learned from the experience was to remain calm when the surprises come,'' said the woman, who spoke about her experiences only on condition that her name not be used. ''The biggest thing for me was to tackle the problem of the day, and every day there were new problems, electrical, plumbing, joists. If you don't like dealing with problems, this is not for you.''</p>
        <p>M ICHAEL HOURIHAN, a former tax lawyer who is now commercial real estate developer, has converted two brownstones in Manhattan. He is still recovering from a structural surprise. ''I usually live in the houses myself for a while before selling them, but my most recent one I ended up selling quicker than I had anticipated,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Last spring, Mr. Hourihan bought a house on East 69th Street that had been built in the 1870's and converted to a rooming house in the 1930's. Gutted by fire about 30 years ago, it was rebuilt into a four-family residence. When he bought it, Mr. Hourihan intended to carve out a duplex for himself, retain two rental apartments to carry the mortgage and then take over the whole building for his own use in a few years.</p>
        <p>''In the process of doing cosmetic renovations in the rental space, we discovered structural flaws that were a result of the renovation after the fire, stuff even an architect and engineer who came through couldn't see,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The necessary repairs would have been so extensive, he said, that ''once I had to do that level of rip-out, I decided it would be too costly to put in kitchens and bathrooms for the apartments only to rip them out in a few years when I wanted to change it to a single-family,'' he said. Instead, he skipped right to the final renovation.</p>
        <p>''I moved in for a short while, but it didn't make sense to be paying the heavy mortgage, so I put it on the market around Thanksgiving, and it will close on April 25.'' He bought the building for $1.4 million, he said, and spent $350,000 in renovations that would have cost far more had he not been in the business. He is selling it for $2.7 million.</p>
        <p>By comparison, the house the Orrs bought in Brooklyn needed relatively little repair. Since it only contained one rental apartment, whose kitchen and bathroom they have already removed, they did not have to gut it. ''It was renovated with new electrical and plumbing systems in the late 1970's, so the renovation is mainly to change it from a two-family to a one-family house rather than major structural changes,'' Ms. Orr said.</p>
        <p>They took down a 25-foot wall that had been put up to keep the stairway private and are installing 10-inch steel beams to prevent floors from sagging.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the woman who is renovating the East Side town house is moving into the home stretch, picking out knobs, putting up  house numbers at the front door, installing lighting fixtures.</p>
        <p>The unexpected crises are now a memory. ''I thought my house would be nice, but I never thought it would be this beautiful,'' she said. ''It's great having a basement for storage, having a place to put bills, having a basketball net in the backyard, being able to open the door and just walking outside without going into an elevator.''</p>
        <p>But there is one break she has yet to make. ''You definitely miss the handyman,'' she said. ''So I have hired the handyman from my old building to come in one Sunday a month.''</p>
