        <p>Interview with Martin Spit, one of first occupants of renovated luxury rental that is being developed from old Beckenstein building on Orchard Street on Manhattan's Lower East Side; Spit is paying $3,000 a month for studio apartment (Habitats column) (M)</p>

        <p>IF only the Jewish immigrants who once made their living from pushcarts on the Lower East Side could see what has become of their neighborhood. People are paying a lot of money to live in old tenements; someone is even paying $3,000 a month to live in a studio apartment.</p>
        <p>But Martin Spit is no fool taken in by gentrification. It is true that he is paying $3,000 a month for a one-room apartment on Orchard Street, near Delancey. But in a way it isn't really an apartment. It's more like a Manhattan treehouse, a tiny, high-ceilinged space on the sixth floor flanked by large terraces that provide the most perfect views of the city; not so high up that they become abstracted and distant, but unobstructed and unmarred. Even taking a shower, he gets a view of the Empire State Building.</p>

        <p>IF only the Jewish immigrants who once made their living from pushcarts on the Lower East Side could see what has become of their neighborhood. People are paying a lot of money to live in old tenements; someone is even paying $3,000 a month to live in a studio apartment.</p>
        <p>But Martin Spit is no fool taken in by gentrification. It is true that he is paying $3,000 a month for a one-room apartment on Orchard Street, near Delancey. But in a way it isn't really an apartment. It's more like a Manhattan treehouse, a tiny, high-ceilinged space on the sixth floor flanked by large terraces that provide the most perfect views of the city; not so high up that they become abstracted and distant, but unobstructed and unmarred. Even taking a shower, he gets a view of the Empire State Building.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spit is one of the first occupants of the renovated luxury rental that was developed from the old Beckenstein building, long known on the Lower East Side for its great deals on fabric. The Beckenstein company is now at 2 West 20th Street.</p>
        <p>He is here from the Netherlands for just a year and a half, transferred by his employer, Ernst &amp; Young Consulting, where he specializes in information technology for financial services.</p>
        <p>That amount of time seems barely enough to get settled, but he is unfazed. ''You must see it as a personal-development plan,'' said Mr. Spit, 30. ''A year and a half might seem short, but it's long enough to lose your life in Holland. You must build a life here.'' He started, as apparently many of his compatriots do, at the Netherland Club of New York, in Midtown. ''They tell me,'' he said, ''that in the greater New York area, there are 40,000 Dutchmen.''</p>
        <p>IN January, staying temporarily in a hotel and looking for a place to live, he walked into the Halstead Property Company office on Broadway in the Village and told a saleswoman, Joanna Lee, that he was looking for a place with rent no higher than $3,000 a month, at least one bedroom, preferably furnished, and a view.</p>
        <p>Of course, none of the places he saw exactly fit what he imagined he wanted. Some ''very nice apartments'' in the Village, he said, would have been fine, but they were $5,000 a month or more. A very large apartment near Wall Street had plenty of space but no view. When he first saw the place on Orchard Street, he said, he liked looking at the Chrysler Building, the World Trade Center and the bridges, but he considered the apartment way too small.</p>
        <p>He kept looking, but as often happens, he returned, and the place was still available, and still under construction. The apartment was being expensively renovated, with new windows, a dishwasher, a washing machine, stainless steel counters  and oak-strip floors. Although this little perch on top of the building existed when the building was a fabric store, it wasn't some kind of penthouse for the mohair velvet. The decks had to be constructed and the apartment created.</p>
        <p>It is not the last luxury renovation on the Lower East Side. George Arana, a Halstead sales associate who grew up on the Lower East Side and specializes in that area, said that a building on Ludlow Street was being renovated into lofts that are to have radiant heating in the floors and rent for $6,000 a month.</p>
        <p>When the construction of the 18 apartments on Orchard Street was finished in February, Mr. Spit moved in, renting a bed and bookcases and buying a glass table, its lightness an asset in a room that is merely a lens for viewing the outside. Still to come is a sofa bed for guests from Holland. ''The e-mails have already started coming,'' he said.</p>
        <p>BEFORE moving here, he had never even visited New York, and knew it from images like ''N.Y.P.D. Blue.'' ''I expected a fast-moving city full of rude people,'' he said. It is as fast, or faster, than he expected, he said, but apparently the people aren't all that rude. ''The people I've met here are very open,'' he said, and he likes that.</p>
        <p>He likes the old standbys in his neighborhood, like the Russ &amp; Daughters specialty food shop on Houston Street, as well as the new restaurants, like Lucien and Le Pere Pinard, and clubs, like Torch, where he heard Deanna Storey, whose CD is playing as he speaks. The heterogeneity is compelling; Irish pubs run by Irishmen, French restaurants that are totally French. ''That's what I like about New York most,'' he said. ''It's this tossed salad of cultures.''</p>
        <p>He parks his car on the street and leaves every morning at 7 for a commute that sometimes takes as long as three hours round trip, to his client's office in New Jersey. Didn't he consider living near the office, to spare himself that drive?</p>
        <p>Mr. Spit, who seems to have instantly become a true Manhattanite, looks stunned. ''That's a question?'' he said. Recovering, because he still retains the politeness of a Dutchman, he explained. ''The area around Somerset is very nice,'' he said. ''It's good if you're 50, and have two kids and a dog.''</p>
