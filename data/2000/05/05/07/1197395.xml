        <p>THE intimate Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam has long been considered one of the state's brightest cultural jewels. It will soon need a new appraisal. The Tony Award-winning theater is on the verge of a $30 million expansion that will turn the quaint little town into a virtual musical-theater theme park.</p>
        <p>''We've outgrown our current facilities,'' said Michael Price, Goodspeed's executive director since 1967. ''This expansion will not only help us meet our growing needs but draw even more people to this part of the state than before.''</p>
        <p>A feasibility study is being conducted now, Mr. Price said, after which the project will be put out to bid. The expansion is expected to be completed by 2004 or 2005.</p>
        <p>Goodspeed Opera House is known as the charming, Victorian theater where the Broadway hits ''Man of La Mancha,'' ''Annie'' and ''Shenandoah'' were born. That original 398-seat theater will be surrounded by a new 650-seat theater and 30,000-square-foot production center.</p>
        <p>The expansion will spill over to Main Street when nine local buildings owned by Goodspeed will be developed into retail stores, restaurants and residences for actors, designers and company members. Goodspeed will continue to own and operate the 200-seat Norma Terris Theater in nearby Chester, where new musicals are developed.</p>
        <p>In granting Goodspeed its first installment of $2 million, the state proved its commitment to ''polishing up one of our true gems,'' Gov. John G. Rowland recently said. ''This helps create excitement in this part of the state.''</p>
        <p>Goodspeed, which sits on the Connecticut River, puts an estimated $25 million into the local economy. Once the expansion is completed in 2005, that figure could balloon to more than $60 million.</p>
        <p>Mr. Price said that the first $2 million grant from the state will be used for buying a site for the new theater, conducting a traffic study, and commissioning a design for the venue. The money was released last month once Goodspeed raised $2 million to match the grant.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rowland said that though there was no ''magical formula,'' the state would add $10 million to the $20 million that Goodspeed would have to raise.</p>
        <p>''It's been my experience that people want to be part of a success story,'' Mr. Rowland said. ''They see project like this going up around them and they want to get involved. Tourism is up 40 percent now and the time is good to invest in the state's culture.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rowland pointed out that the first thing he did in his administration was double spending for the arts. Other performing arts sites like the Warner in Torrington, the Palace in Waterbury, the Stamford Center for the Performing Arts and Polka Dot Playhouse in Bridgeport have benefited from the state's largesse.</p>
        <p>''It's part of our overall plan,'' Mr. Rowland said, adding that he had also bolstered the schools' arts programs. ''One of our calling cards is culture, so it makes sense to invest in it.''</p>
        <p>Selecting Goodspeed for expansion also has its political benefits since the demise of the Connecticut Yankee Atomic Power Company in Haddam Neck has cost the community.</p>
        <p>''Financially, that did hurt some of the communities,'' Mr. Rowland said. ''But that wasn't a factor in the plan to expand Goodspeed. It was Goodspeed's time.</p>
        <p>''You look at this as investment,'' he said. ''You're building morale. How do you value people going from Greenwich to Polka Dot Theater in Bridgeport? Everybody benefits.''</p>
        <p>The plan will allow Goodspeed to expand its production schedule. The new 650-seat theater will present four shows a season, simultaneously with the existing theater. Goodspeed presently offers three musicals in both of its theaters from April to December.</p>
        <p>''We'll now be able to transfer shows to New York without having to redesign and build them,'' Mr. Price said. ''The original opera house is much smaller than Broadway theaters and it is very expensive to move shows. We'll also be able to build shows for touring, which is something we've never done before.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Price said that the idea for the expansion came from a slightly wilder idea he had a few years ago. ''I told the board of directors that I wanted to put a showboat in the river,'' he said. ''The board liked the idea. Governor Rowland liked it. Then, the board thought about it and said, 'You want a showboat? Fine! We need a real theater first.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Price had no problem dry-docking his floating theater idea because he knew as well as anyone that the existing Goodspeed had outgrown itself.</p>
        <p>''When I first came here it was me and a press agent. Now there's over 100 full-time employees,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Many businesses undergoing expansion often lose their family feel. Mr. Price is confident that Goodspeed won't lose any of its charm.</p>
        <p>''Theaters are by nature a mom and pop business,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''They can't be run like corporations. I'm always around, keeping involved in all aspects of the business. Even though we're growing, we're still a family. We're just getting a larger house to live in.''</p>
