        <p>Suspect in Killing Of Doctor Eludes Search</p>
        <p>The search continues for James C. Kopp, the 45-year-old fugitive indicted last June in the killing of Dr. Barnett A. Slepian, a Buffalo-area obstetrician who performed abortions.</p>
        <p>Dr. Slepian was killed inside his home in Amherst, N.Y., by someone shooting from woods behind his house.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kopp appears on the F.B.I.'s 10 Most Wanted list, with 29 aliases, including Clyde Swenson, Enoch A. Guettler, P. Anastation and Atomic Dog. He has also been sought for questioning in four nonfatal sniper attacks on doctors who perform abortions in western New York, and is wanted by Canadian officials in the 1995 attack on Dr. Hugh Short, of Ancaster, Ontario, who was shot in the right elbow.</p>
        <p>''The good news for the public is that the F.B.I., if it has a strength, it's in locating fugitives and apprehending them, especially if they're on the top 10 list,'' said Paul Moskal, a special agent with the bureau in Buffalo. ''Ultimately, all of those people are caught, with rare exceptions.''</p>
        <p>The bureau is offering a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading directly to Mr. Kopp's arrest.</p>
        <p>''He's as likely on the corner on 42nd Street as he is in Tokyo,'' said Mr. Moskal, who added that Mr. Kopp had been arrested abroad in the past. ''This is the type of investigation where tens of thousands of man-hours are invested, and in that sense we're a day closer, every day that goes by.''</p>
        <p>Relief May Be on Way In Public Toilet Search</p>
        <p>As the wintry city smells of roasting chestnuts and pretzels melt away into summery scents of cut grass and open sewers, New Yorkers are still lacking that luxury that many smaller cities take for granted: the public toilet. But that may be changing shortly.</p>
        <p>In 1996, the city rolled out its plan for a 20-year franchise for 3,300 bus shelters, 430 newsstands and 30 toilets. A handful of design firms spent millions of dollars in pursuit of the franchise, part of it trying to create the prototypical New York toilet. But Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani suddenly canceled the project in June 1998, saying the city would prefer to ''encourage competition and greater design variation.''</p>
        <p>And citizens stood by, crossing their legs and clenching their eyebrows.</p>
        <p>''This is a great study in how a city can fail to solve a serious problem when given an excellent cost-free solution,'' said Doug Lasdon, executive director of the Urban Justice Center, which, under the name of Legal Action Center for the Homeless, issued a report 10 years ago about the need for public toilets. ''How come we can't do it?''</p>
        <p>Now, Peter F. Vallone, the City Council speaker, is hoping to help deliver the bathroom pass to end all bathroom passes -- 100 toilets for the city, at $50,000 each.</p>
        <p>''Rising from the failures of the administration's plan to put in pay toilets, the speaker has put in $5 million in our budget,'' said Jordan Barowitz, Mr. Vallone's spokesman, who added that the speaker had just come back from Europe with snapshots of himself in front of various public potties from world capitals.</p>
        <p>''We hope the mayor will agree with this plan, and we will be negotiating this with him in the upcoming budget talks,'' Mr. Barowitz said.</p>
        <p>The plan is to use city money to build the toilets, instead of creating a public restroom franchise.</p>
        <p>''We can build them ourselves,'' Mr. Barowitz said, ''and worry about selling advertising and franchises later, so the public can have some relief.''</p>
