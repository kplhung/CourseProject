        <p>Some Westchester County school districts, prompted by New York State Education Department mandates to reduce class size, help students meet new requirements and hire more math and science teachers, are submitting considerably higher school budget proposals for 2000-2001 school year (M)</p>

        <p>THE need to meet rising state standards, combined with increased student enrollment, is the driving force behind the proposed 2000-2001 school budgets that will be presented to voters on May 16.</p>
        <p>According to the State Education Department, school districts will need to spend about $880 million between now and 2004 to reduce class size, to provide extra assistance for students who are having trouble meeting the new requirements and to add more math and science teachers to their staffs.</p>
        <p>For the most part, the spending increases in Westchester range between 3 and 8 percent, with the county average at about 7 percent.</p>
        <p>There are some exceptions. Valhalla's proposed $21,130,099 budget reflects a 14.59 percent increase, while Harrison's $58,224,041 proposed budget both represents 15.2  percent increase. Both Blind Brook and Byram Hills are seeking 12 percent increases.</p>
        <p>''The main reason for this increase is that Harrison is growing by leaps and bounds,'' Dr. Donald Howard, the superintendent, said. ''In three years, the enrollment has grown by 400 students. We have to add 18 teachers as well as an additional $740,000 for special education services. Ten percent of that increase is for the district's debt service on two bonds that had been passed earlier.  We're also building seven portable classrooms at the middle school.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, in Rye a significant portion of the district's 8.72 percent  budget increase will go for debt service, Dr. Edward Shine, the superintendent, said. ''It's really a stand-still budget,'' he said, observing that last year the district hired 13 more teachers.</p>
        <p>The nearly 10 percent increase in Scarsdale, Superintendent Michael McGill said, is largely a response to the growing middle school population. ''We're adding 11 positions there and 16 overall in the district,'' Dr. McGill said.</p>
        <p>One difference in Scarsdale, Dr. McGill said, is that there is ''an effort to add to the amount of money we reinvest in maintenance of our buildings and grounds, as a way to avoid bonding in the future.'' He added: ''It's a way of saving money in the long run. We know we're asking people to make a significant commitment here, and we hope we'll have the kind of support we've had historically for our programs.''</p>
        <p>And many eyes are on Greenburgh Central 7, where for years the community has registered its displeasure with the district's performance by defeating school budgets. This year, the administration is proposing a 1.5 percent increase, which translates to a zero percent tax increase.</p>
        <p>Community members turned out in force last month to protest administrative decisions to deny tenure to seven educators, a move that some critics viewed as a cost-cutting strategy, which administrators denied.</p>
        <p>''We want to bring in a budget that is very low and reverse a trend of defeating budgets,'' the interim superintendent, Jerry Cicchelli, said. ''There's no sacrifice in the instructional areas.''</p>
