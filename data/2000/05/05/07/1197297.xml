        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In his review of Frances FitzGerald's ''Way Out There in the Blue'' (April 16), Alan Brinkley neglects to mention how the nature of the missile threat to the United States has changed. In Ronald Reagan's day, the threat was of a massive launching from the Soviet Union. That's been replaced with the more manageable threat of a small number of missiles launched by rogue states like North Korea, Iraq and Iran, all of whom have shown requisite capability.</p>

        <p>Yes, Reagan was the first to advocate a missile defense program, but focusing exclusively on its link to him is an attempt to demonize the current program by those who think that he always had to be wrong.</p>
