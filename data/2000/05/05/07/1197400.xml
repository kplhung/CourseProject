        <p>Marsden Hartley  Heckscher Museum of Art, Two Prime Avenue, Huntington. Through May 28. (631) 351-3250.</p>
        <p>Organized by the Kraushaar Gallery in Manhattan, ''Marsden Hartley: Drawings'' is the first exhibition in 20 years to highlight Hartley's work as a draughtsman. To complement several Alpine drawings, the Heckscher has added its own ''Garmish-Partenkirchen No. 1,'' an oil study of the peak that was as iconic to Hartley as Mount St. Victoire was to Cezanne.</p>
        <p>Well known as a pioneering modernist painter who later turned to an expressionistic naturalism, Hartley used drawing as a means of exploring different aspects of the subjects that interested him. While his painting technique could be bold, even deliberately crude, his related drawings are often delicate, as in many of the still lifes and landscapes on view.</p>
        <p>Beginning with a group of early figure studies, including an especially interesting group sketch from Hartley's first stay in Germany, the show illustrates his use of drawing for both observation and analysis. Far more than his paintings, the drawings -- especially the sliver points -- bring out nuances of shape and texture. In this exquisite medium, parallel hatched lines build up tones that define the volumes of fruit, drapery and landscape elements. Nowhere is Hartley's admiration of Cezanne more overtly and lovingly demonstrated.</p>
        <p>In drawings that more directly mirror his painting strategies, Hartley handles still life and landscape as collections of massed forms. In ''Zinnias,'' for example, the objects are stylized for the sake of formal unity, and the flowers, cloth and fruit become abstracted compositional building blocks. On one wall, a group of mountain views showcases Hartley's technical range, from the shimmering pastel of ''Blue Landscape,'' with its flattened perspective and emphasis on tonal subtlety, to the spare angularity of his Waxenstein drawing, in which steep crags tower ominously over a fragile chalet.</p>
        <p>Jack Youngerman  Guild Hall Museum, 158 Main Street, East Hampton. Through June 4. (631) 324-0806.</p>
        <p>Surveying a 10-year period from 1990 to the present, the sculpture portion of the show, ''Jack Youngerman: Wood Sculpture and Drawings,'' traces Mr. Youngerman's transition from relatively flat, wave-based shapes to fully modeled forms that fuse the organic and the geometric. Many of the motifs in the earlier works are echoed in the drawings, which are grouped in an adjacent gallery.</p>
        <p>The drawings also relate to Mr. Youngerman's paintings, which often suggest abstracted plants and other nature motifs that have been taken out of context. Billed as studies for an abandoned series of etchings, they appear as a set of thematic variations in which the focus shifts back and forth between observation and response. The nature-based abstractions of Arthur Dove come to mind, only Mr. Youngerman eliminates color to concentrate on interpenetrating and complementary shapes.</p>
        <p>This positive-negative interplay is central to the cut-out sculptures of the early 1990's. Although not as flat as his pierced metal works, laminated wood pieces like ''Wave II'' and ''Crasher'' are planar in structure, relying on shallow space for their dramatic impact. Recently, however, Mr. Youngerman has begun to explore the possibilities of interactive volumes and the structural variations of continuously developed forms. Beautifully fabricated by the master woodworker Warren Padula, the laminates combine the sensuous appeal of wood tones and textures with the cool rationality of geometric structure.</p>
        <p>Whether softly rounded, as in the ''Gemini'' variations, or hard-edged, like the helix-shaped stacks of the ''Ascent'' pieces, Mr. Youngerman's basic forms seem to develop progressively, with each element repeating itself the way a cell divides or a crystal grows. Like Brancusi's so-called endless columns, several of the vertical pieces could be imagined as capable of continuing to evolve. Others, like the subtly tapering ''Little Spired Gemini II,'' bring their formal progress to a satisfying conclusion.</p>
        <p>'American Works on Paper'  Art Museum, Museums at Stony Brook, 1208 Route 25A, Stony Brook. Through May 21. (631) 751-0066.</p>
        <p>This is really two discreet exhibitions, juxtaposing watercolors and pastels from the Palmer Museum of Art at Pennsylvania State University with prints from the Telfair Museum of Art in Savannah, Ga. Together they comprise an informative survey spanning the late 19th century to the mid-1940's.</p>
        <p>In addition to offering Long Islanders a sampling of collections from other parts of the country, the shows feature celebrated artists like William Merritt Chase, Arthur B. Davies and Thomas Hart Benton, together with some of their lesser-known contemporaries. Thus, in spite of their relatively small size, the two shows give a well-rounded picture of developments in American printmaking, watercolor and pastel painting during the period in question.</p>
        <p>The prints are arranged thematically, with groupings of urban views, scenes of rural life and other related subjects. Artists who specialized in the city, including Louis Lozowick, Charles Sheeler and John Sloan, are represented by characteristic works. Edward Hopper's evocative ''Night Shadows'' sums up the sense of isolation tinged with menace that is unique to the urban milieu after dark. The Social Realists William Gropper and Philip Evergood were known for studies of the poor in both urban and rural settings, as in Gropper's portrait of Dust Bowl refugees. But many other artists also turned their attention to the plight of the displaced and the worker during the Depression years. Geraldo Belfiore, Litterio Calapai and Isabelle L. Miller exemplify those who viewed printmaking as a means of expressing sympathy for the common people and an inexpensive way to take art to the masses.</p>
        <p>Although not as widely marketed as graphics, watercolors and pastels often have a freshness and immediacy that make them especially appealing. Watercolor's translucency and the soft tones of pastel are ideal for sketching, and several of the works on view reflect the spontaneity of work done on the spot, with little revision after the fact. The melting atmosphere of liquid pigment is typified by Jonas Lie's ''In the Harbor,'' while more dramatic effects are achieved in David Fredenthal's ''Trunk, Rock, Mountains.'' Both media also lend themselves to more finished handling, as in Chase's pastel ''October,'' a view of Shinnecock with two of his daughters enjoying the fine fall weather, and Davies's imaginary landscape, a typical subject that he also treated in numerous oils.</p>
