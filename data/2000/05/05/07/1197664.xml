        <p>In the shadowy world of Japanese politics true turning points can be difficult to spot.</p>
        <p>But in the last few weeks, after the incapacitating stroke suffered by a sitting prime minister, and the retirement from politics of a former prime minister who was his mentor, Japanese politicians and commentators have begun to speak of the end of a style of factional politics that has been in force for 45 years.</p>
        <p>The sudden illness of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi last month, and the retirement of Noboru Takeshita this week -- both men belonged to the dominant faction of the long-ruling Liberal Democratic Party -- has been likened to a corporation's abrupt loss of both its chairman and chief executive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Obuchi's stroke forced the party's historically dominant faction to surrender the prime minister's office to a rival group in the party, led by the country's new prime minister, Yoshiro Mori. But many analysts are treating Mr. Takeshita's retirement, officially attributed to a severe back ailment, as the more significant event.</p>
        <p>In Japanese politics since World War II, Mr. Takeshita, 76, has had few rivals in terms of sheer power or endurance. Although he was prime minister for less than 18 months, he remained his party's ultimate broker up to the nomination of his protege, Mr. Obuchi, in 1998. His style was a sharp contrast to that of his predecessor, Kakuei Tanaka, the sharp-tongued political don who preceded Mr. Takeshita as the Liberal Democratic Party's undisputed kingmaker. Mr. Tanaka was brought down by a bribery scandal in 1974 after serving as prime minister for just two years.</p>
        <p>''Tanaka was very gruff, very forceful and very opinionated,'' said Gerald L. Curtis, a professor of political science at Columbia University. ''Then came Takeshita, the master consensus builder, the master of the art of mediating between people who want something from the government and the people who have the power to give it.''</p>
        <p>By getting things done while allowing others to take the credit, Mr. Takeshita perfected a model of money-centered, ideology-free machine politics whose opacity and indirection perfectly suited a modern Japan in full expansion.</p>
        <p>''To understand Takeshita is to understand what power means in Japan,'' said Toru Hayano, a senior columnist at the Asahi Shimbun, a major newspaper. ''He is not eloquent. He is not a big philosopher. He has no special program of reforms. The essence of his style was to adjust a little bit every day based on what you have gathered up until then. If there is opposition, you consult with others. When a decision is reached, you distribute the rewards.''</p>
        <p>Typically, the rewards were distributed first to rural Japan, whose wealth the government cultivated by protecting its agricultural products from competition, and subsidizing transportation and construction.</p>
        <p>Like his predecessor, Mr. Takeshita, in 1989, was forced to resign as  prime minister because of a scandal.  However, he played the pivotal role in determining the choice of seven of the next eight prime ministers.</p>
        <p>Critics say that Mr. Takeshita and his faction became a virtual politburo that used its control over the pork barrel to dominate the country's overwhelmingly dominant party, suppressing debate in the process.</p>
        <p>With Mr. Obuchi in a coma, the faction was caught with no obvious candidate for the prime minister's office, and no one with the power and prestige to serve as kingmaker.</p>
        <p>''Takeshita's retirement should be seen as a symbolic event indicating that this peculiar style of political control -- peculiar even in the history of Japanese politics -- is beginning to change,'' the Asahi Shimbun said in a recent editorial.</p>
        <p>What comes next, many feel, will be a period of unusual competition, both within the Liberal Democratic Party and without. The new prime minister, Mr. Mori, is widely expected to call parliamentary elections on June 25. But hobbled by an unpopular coalition with a Buddhist-affiliated party, and a weak economy, his prospects are uncertain.</p>
        <p>A poor result could cause the party to jettison Mr. Mori, sparking a free-for-all in which no faction of the governing party can dominate by sheer numbers. Under these circumstances, long-submerged policy differences over questions like heavy deficit spending, subsidies for the farming and construction lobbies and economic liberalization would likely come to the fore.</p>
        <p>''Currently there is no order-giving power in the L.D.P. and the factions are disintegrating,'' said a wistful Shigezo Hayasaka, Mr. Takeshita's longtime political secretary. ''Of course the L.D.P. has plenty of young people, but they are so conscious of their own rights that they are no good at working within the system.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 9, 2000, Tuesday  An article on Sunday about recent changes in Japanese politics misidentified the former prime minister whose longtime political aide, Shigezo Hayasaka, commented on the changes. He served under Kakuei Tanaka, not Noboru Takeshita.</p>
