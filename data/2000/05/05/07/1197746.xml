        <p>FRED TREGASKIS, who builds wine cellars for a living, said he remembers when city restaurants were the sum total of his clientele. That was in the early 1990's. Now Mr. Tregaskis, of West Cornwall, Conn., is more likely to find work at private homes in Westchester and Fairfield County.</p>
        <p>The owner of New England Wine Cellars, Mr. Tregaskis said he built about 40 cellars last year, his biggest year ever. ''Cellars have become the rage in new construction,'' he said. ''I've built several cellars in nice homes where the client wasn't an avid wine collector, but felt their home wasn't complete unless it had a wine cellar.''</p>

        <p>FRED TREGASKIS, who builds wine cellars for a living, said he remembers when city restaurants were the sum total of his clientele. That was in the early 1990's. Now Mr. Tregaskis, of West Cornwall, Conn., is more likely to find work at private homes in Westchester and Fairfield County.</p>
        <p>The owner of New England Wine Cellars, Mr. Tregaskis said he built about 40 cellars last year, his biggest year ever. ''Cellars have become the rage in new construction,'' he said. ''I've built several cellars in nice homes where the client wasn't an avid wine collector, but felt their home wasn't complete unless it had a wine cellar.''</p>
        <p>Cellars can come with wide-screen televisions, spiral staircases and antique decorative knickknacks.</p>
        <p>''They want hand-forged hardware on their door and old-fashioned lighting,'' Mr. Tregaskis said. ''They also often want a medieval Italian look: 'Tuscany.' I hear that word all the time.''</p>
        <p>As demand for fine wine rises, with a record $18.1 billion worth of wine sold in the United States in 1999, having a place at home to store it safely has become a priority.</p>
        <p>Adam Strum, chairman of the Wine Enthusiast, a wine-accessory catalog company in Hawthorne, said sales of its custom-built cellars, which start at about $5,000 for a remodeled closet, rose to 397 last year from 234 in 1998. In the first quarter of this year, he said demand is more than double what it was at this time last year. Christine Hawley of Manhattan, who has designed cellars in Westchester and the Hamptons, said the strong economy has a lot to do with it.</p>
        <p>''The economy has been so good, people already have as many cars as they can drive, as many homes as they can go to,'' Ms. Hawley said. ''One thing people haven't experienced is the newest pleasure left, which is wine cellars.''</p>
        <p>Not long ago, a wine cellar was thought of as a rack under the basement stairs. But today the trend is more in line with Joe O'Connor's 3,000-bottle home cellar in Briarcliff Manor, which Mr. Tregaskis is building.</p>
        <p>''We want it to be a room where you can actually have dinner,'' said Mr. O'Connor, who would not say how much his cellar would cost. ''We were very excited to build our house four years ago, but this is something that I'm far more excited about.''</p>
        <p>Paul Wyatt, a designer who runs the Fine Wine Rack and Cellar Company in San Carlos, Calif., which provides supplies for cellars around the country, said the New York City metropolitan region is one of six regions in the United States where the cellar market is strongest.</p>
        <p>''Volume is going up every year,'' he said. ''Periodically, I get so busy I can't see straight, so I raise my prices and volume goes up again.''</p>
        <p>Evan Goldenberg of Design Build Consultants in Greenwich attributed the strong demand to the rise in the stock market. One of his clients, Tony Bosco of North Salem, is a managing director at Morgan Stanley.</p>
        <p>''I got interested in wine through entertaining,'' Mr. Bosco said. ''With the Wall Street career, we would have parties with very fine wines. There would be people there who would go to tastings with professional writers, the kind of people who drank from unmarked bottles and guessed what wine it was.''</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Bosco is selling his house, and he sees the cellar as a feature more people in the stock-market business have come to expect. ''People who have weekend or country homes here, more and more you hear about it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>David Pedowitz, an investment banker who lives in Bedford, is already on his second cellar, with a 5,000-bottle capacity and a $75,000 price tag. He said he has been a wine collector for years.</p>
        <p>'''The investment advisory business is tense and nerve racking,'' he said. ''You find people in this business looking for releases from that tension. For me, it's wine, whiskey and cigars.'</p>
        <p>In addition to storing his wine at an optimal temperature of 55 degrees, Mr. Pedowitz's cellar, when completed, will include a spiral staircase, a 10-by-13-foot tasting room, a special stand-up rack for his collection of single-malt scotches, mahogany doors and a burglar alarm and a temperature alarm.</p>
        <p>Some higher-end clients want elaborate cabinets instead of racks for their bottles, creating an effect that Mr. Goldenberg likens to ''a library for wine.''</p>
        <p>He said his projects tend to be expensive largely because he works with sophisticated refrigeration equipment with temperature-sensitive alarm systems and low-voltage electronic controls.</p>
        <p>''Things really started to pick up in 1996,'' he said. ''Projects had been in the $25,000-to-$35,000 range. Then they quickly graduated to the $45,000-to-$55,000 range. I'd have clients call me to say they moved and needed a new wine cellar. I'd have other clients tell me they ran out of space and needed another wine cellar.''</p>
        <p>While a cellar can be a way to explore a deeply personal passion, for others, it is a smart investment.</p>
        <p>''They're a very hot item now,'' said David Ogilvy, who owns a real estate concern in Greenwich. ''What sells houses are things like condition and master bedrooms, but a wine cellar is a really nice piece of cake.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hawley said she believed that wine collecting is about more than drinking or investing. It can provide entre into a world where one becomes a ''connoisseur of life.''</p>
        <p>''When you start building a cellar, a lot of things change in your life,'' she said. ''You think about going to wine countries for vacations. You start going to wine auctions. Your friends change, because you're more focused on people who love wine. Your diet changes, because you want food that goes with your wine. It's like having a baby. I see people get so energized and focused.''</p>
