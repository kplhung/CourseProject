        <p>Vladimir Kalamanov may have the toughest job in Russia. As the Kremlin's special envoy for human rights, his task is to persuade a skeptical West that Russia is serious about ending human rights abuses in Chechnya.</p>
        <p>It is a hard sell. Despite numerous accounts of pillaging, beatings and killings by Russian troops in Chechnya, only a handful of cases have been investigated by military prosecutors. And while Mr. Kalamanov insists he is making progress, he is the first to acknowledge that the Russian military routinely withholds critical details of investigations.</p>
        <p>''I can't say that I am entirely satisfied,'' he said in an interview. ''I have not received all of the information I have asked for.''</p>
        <p>As President Clinton and President-elect Vladimir V. Putin prepare for their June meeting in Moscow, human rights is again emerging as a politically charged issue -- and not just for Russia.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration has made it clear that the brutal war in Chechnya will not prevent it from doing business with Mr. Putin, particularly on arms control. But the United States has also sought to assure human rights activists that it is not neglecting the issue and is pressing for an independent investigation.</p>
        <p>That has put the spotlight squarely on Mr. Kalamanov.</p>
        <p>Most Russian officials reject Western human rights complaints as a plot to blacken the nation's image. Mr. Kalamanov, by contrast, has the disarming manner of agreeing with many of the critics and then imploring them to accept that Russia is involved in a long and complex struggle to build a democratic society and hold the once-sacrosanct military to account.</p>
        <p>''You should not see this as a game the president is playing to influence international opinion,'' he said. ''The role of the army and civil authority is being rethought, but we are only at the beginning.''</p>
        <p>Critics, however, portray Mr. Kalamanov as an earnest official who tells the West what it wants to hear, but who has been granted neither the resources nor the authority by Mr. Putin to bring the culprits to justice.</p>
        <p>''Kalamanov is a formidable figure,'' said Kenneth Roth, the executive director of Human Rights Watch, the international rights organization. ''He is aware of the atrocities, but he must work through the chief military prosecutor, who is determined not to do anything. The best way to inspire confidence is to deliver results, and so far there have not been significant results.''</p>
        <p>It seems that Mr. Kalamanov, a 47-year-old official of Syrian descent,  should be in a strong position. Eager to strengthen ties with the West and avoid international sanctions, Mr. Putin has vowed to end human rights abuses. And in February, Mr. Putin, who will be inaugurated on Sunday, named Mr. Kalamanov as an ombudsman on human rights and gave him the lofty mandate of protecting civil rights in Chechnya.</p>
        <p>Despite the official backing from Mr. Putin, however, Mr. Kalamanov seems to be playing David to the Russian military Goliath. Still, he claims some successes. He has arranged for two European officials to work with his team in Chechnya, a move intended to assure the West that his efforts are not a whitewash. And he has worked to assemble a list of prisoners in Russian detention centers in Chechnya and helped them obtain legal representation. Soon, he boasts, Chechnya will have a functioning court system.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Kalamanov has not yet been able to do is to bring Russian soldiers to justice. Human Rights Watch has documented a series of assaults and killings in the Chechen town of Alkhan-Yurt and in the Staropromyslovsky and Aldi areas of the Chechen capital of Grozny. Mr. Kalamanov says he takes the reports seriously and that his investigators have received corroborating testimony about some of the abuses.</p>
        <p>But it is up to military and civilian prosecutors to bring criminal charges, and they have been very reluctant. Military prosecutors say they are investigating more than 300 crimes by Russian soldiers in Chechnya, but only 10 involve allegations of crimes against civilians.</p>
        <p>So far, only two of these cases have been referred to the military court for possible trial, and they concern the relatively modest offenses of ''hooliganism'' and mishandling weapons.</p>
        <p>The reluctance of the military prosecutors to act has diminished Mr. Kalamanov's authority. To monitor the effectiveness of the prosecutor's investigations, for example, Mr. Kalamanov has tried to obtain key details of the cases. Instead, he has been given only the most general statistics about the number of investigations.</p>
        <p>Recently, the military announced that Colonel Yuri Budanov, the commander of a tank regiment, has been charged with the rape and murder of a young Chechen woman. In general, however, the generals have not been eager to publicize their investigations into human rights abuses, a step that might deter the troops from committing other crimes and win the confidence of civilians.</p>
        <p>The result is evident at Mr. Kalamanov's office in the Chechen town of Znamenskoye. Housed in a defunct winery, the office has received more than 500 complaints, but they mostly concern delayed pensions, appeals by refugees for tents and medicine, labor disputes, problems in obtaining new documents and, to a lesser extent, charges of illegal detentions and reports of missing persons. It has not fielded any complaints about assaults or thefts by Russian soldiers.</p>
        <p>''I think they doubt our ability to help,'' Alvi Ayubov, the deputy head of the office and an ethnic Chechen, said of Chechnya's residents. ''Ten, 20 or even 30 people cannot always solve these problems. The cooperation of all the entire power structures in the republic, including law enforcement bodies and human rights organizations, are required.''</p>
