        <p>President Clinton has become a crucial behind-the-scenes player in the 2000 campaign, serving as a tactical adviser for House, Senate and gubernatorial candidates around the country.</p>
        <p>Although the spotlight has shifted to Vice President Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton, prominent Democrats portray Mr. Clinton's role as that of an enormously valuable Strategist in Chief. They describe him as a sponge for absorbing political statistics -- a skill that is all the more enhanced because he has run twice in all 435 Congressional districts. And he willingly brings his well-honed political instincts to bear while exerting the power of the presidency to elect Democrats.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has been seeking election or re-election since 1974, when he was defeated in a race for Congress. And the president's closest advisers say that although he is no longer running himself, his passion for electoral politics has never receded. They also cite another, more personal, reason for Mr. Clinton's deep involvement: he wants to burnish his own legacy with the election of Mr. Gore to succeed him, the installation of Mrs. Clinton as senator from New York and the return of the House to Democratic control.</p>
        <p>''The guy can't live without a campaign in his life,'' said Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana. ''Life is a campaign for him. He needs a campaign to keep him going. This guy is not going to go into an igloo and freeze away. He can't help but advise.''</p>
        <p>Politicians and historians say they have never known of a president so deeply immersed in politics -- or a White House that, even during a lame-duck period, was so focused on polls and electoral considerations.</p>
        <p>The president is particularly engrossed in the first lady's race, and to a lesser degree in Mr. Gore's. But his involvement in campaigns from coast to coast is extraordinary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton is much more than a fund-raiser in these campaigns, even as he has collected millions of dollars for House and Senate candidates. He offers candidates pointers on television and radio advertising scripts. He played a significant role in urging some prospects to run in the first place, and he often schedules trips and policy announcements with an eye to helping specific contenders.</p>
        <p>This portrait of Mr. Clinton has been gleaned from interviews with more than two dozen candidates and strategists, as well as lawmakers on Capitol Hill and officials at the White House and at the Democratic National Committee. Joe Lockhart, Mr. Clinton's press secretary, turned down a request to interview the president; some of Mr. Clinton's advisers said they were worried that it would seem unpresidential for him to discuss his activities openly.</p>
        <p>''He's the ultimate junkie,'' said Senator Robert G. Torricelli of New Jersey, chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ''He has the best walking knowledge of anybody in American politics.''</p>
        <p>Referring to Representative Ron Klink's drive to oust Senator Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, Mr. Torricelli said: ''Last night he called me about the Klink race. He said he was convinced Klink could beat Santorum. He said, 'I want to do something in Philadelphia to bring our base in for Klink. I know he can carry western Pennsylvania, but he may have trouble consolidating the base in the east.' ''</p>
        <p>The president's network of contacts is vast because he has stumped in more than half the Congressional districts, his advisers say.</p>
        <p>Mr. Klink said that he telephoned the White House after he won his primary in April and Mr. Clinton ''took my call immediately.''</p>
        <p>''It's not just lip service,'' Mr. Klink said. ''He's really focused on this race. He can open doors with other individuals by telling them that this race is very meaningful to him.''</p>
        <p>Sometimes Mr. Clinton calls candidates on the telephone. More often, he grabs them to talk politics during his travels or at the White House.</p>
        <p>Craig Smith, a former Clinton political director, said he was at the White House recently to watch an Arkansas Razorbacks basketball game. At halftime, Mr. Smith said, the president cornered a group of his guests and held forth about the Democrats' presidential prospects in several states.</p>
        <p>He suggested that Mr. Gore not write off North Carolina in November, even though Mr. Clinton lost the state twice. If the Gore campaign takes that advice, it may cause the Bush campaign to rethink its own electoral tactics.</p>
        <p>''He came over and said, 'How do you think the math is working?' '' Mr. Smith said. ''He said, 'I think North Carolina looks good.' '' But Mr. Smith said he cautioned Mr. Clinton that the Democrats should think twice about pumping resources into the state.</p>
        <p>''I told him that state broke my heart -- twice,'' Mr. Smith said. ''But he said, 'I think we've got a shot.' ''</p>
        <p>Others who have talked politics with Mr. Clinton said he was preoccupied with the need for Democrats to win the loyalty of Hispanic voters. They said he had even spoken in detail about the importance of married Protestants. And, they said, he was particularly intrigued by contests in Michigan, New Jersey and Florida, where Mr. Gore has been pressing his campaign amid the tumult over the administration's handling of the Elian Gonzalez case.</p>
        <p>''Clinton is obsessed with Florida,'' the case of the Cuban boy ''and how it impacts,'' Mr. Torricelli said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton still convenes political meetings twice a month or so in the ornate Yellow Oval Room in the White House family quarters. The sessions are not as pressing as they were when they were held weekly before the 1996 campaign, and the group of participants, which often numbers close to two dozen, is usually larger than the more exclusive club of the past. Mr. Gore does not attend anymore.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, Mr. Clinton assembles his top aides, some cabinet secretaries and others to hash over how Democrats are performing and to look for ways to use his presidency to help candidates.</p>
        <p>At the start of the sessions, Mark Penn, a presidential pollster, reviews the latest surveys on an overhead projector. The discussion that follows is freewheeling, with Mr. Clinton -- who often chews on an unlighted cigar -- sounding at times like a political operative.</p>
        <p>''He is a full-time campaign manager at these meetings,'' one participant said. ''The entire meetings are discussions of how this would be good for Al or for the first lady and how he can help the legacy. Clinton is constantly saying, 'This would help Al.' ''</p>
        <p>Participants at the group's most recent meeting, in April, recalled that Mr. Clinton said he wanted to accept invitations to speak at college graduations in areas with high concentrations of minorities, like Shiprock, N.M., where he thought his appearance would help spur interest in Mr. Gore's campaign.</p>
        <p>A favorite pastime of the group is mocking Republicans in Congress, particularly when they do something that hurts them in the polls.</p>
        <p>James Carville, an architect of Mr. Clinton's victory in 1992, said of the president: ''If he calls me it would be to chat about Gore and Hillary. But I've had him tell me ideas for brochures in Senate races. He's a rare combination of somebody who's got the brains and the gut.''</p>
        <p>Joe Andrew, the national chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said he was dazzled by the president's knowledge of one Congressional district in Indiana, Mr. Andrew's home state. ''He said the Eighth Congressional District is one that goes back and forth -- the bloody Eighth,'' Mr. Andrew said. ''He knew that the southern part of the district was more conservative than the northern part. But he knew that in the southern part there had been tremendous growth because of a Toyota plant that opened there. And he knew of the Whirlpool plant in the northern part that had closed.''</p>
        <p>Michael J. Lapolla, the manager of Union County, N.J., who is seeking a House seat, said he ran into the president at a White House Christmas party last year. ''As soon as he found out what I was running for, he said he liked our chances and he knew just about everything about the district,'' Mr. Lapolla said.</p>
        <p>Mike Honda, a state assemblyman from San Jose, Calif., said Mr. Clinton helped persuade him to run for an open Congressional seat this year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has taken a particular interest in the campaign of Representative Rush D. Holt of New Jersey, a freshman in a tight race. ''His knowledge of New Jersey politics, and about my race in particular, is astounding,'' Mr. Holt said.</p>
        <p>Bill Nelson, the state insurance commissioner in Florida, who is running for the Senate, said Mr. Clinton went out of his way to praise him at a dinner of Floridians in Washington last November -- a move that he said helped considerably in persuading Democrats to take a serious look at his prospects. ''The President stands up in front of all these distinguished Floridians and proceeded to say very kind things about me,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton is particularly involved in Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign. One participant at a meeting with Mrs. Clinton's advisers said it was the president's idea that he not utter a word at his wife's official announcement of her candidacy in February.</p>
        <p>''When the issue came up of whether he would speak at Hillary's announcement, he weighed in and said, 'No,' '' the participant said. ''He said, 'I don't think that's right. This is her day.' There were plenty of people arguing the other way because it seemed unnatural for him not to speak. But it was a good judgment.''</p>
        <p>Despite Mr. Clinton's interest in his wife's race, Mr. Torricelli said the president does not fully grasp the unusual assortment of parties on the ballot in New York. ''He knows New York politically less than a lot of the other states,'' Mr. Torricelli said. ''He doesn't quite understand the mix of all those lines.'' Referring to Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, he said, ''He calls Schumer and gets his opinion and calls me and plays off where we might differ.''</p>
        <p>While in past years some candidates have urged Mr. Clinton to stay clear of their districts, most of those interviewed said they were grateful for the president's wisdom and did not view him as an unwelcome meddler. ''He's not a Mr. Buttinski,'' Mr. Carville said.</p>
        <p>Yet some candidates were not so willing to bow before Mr. Clinton's expertise, perhaps out of fear that they might appear too close to the president. ''I've been in elective office over 20 years in Michigan,'' said Representative Debbie Stabenow, who is running for Senate and campaigned with the president this week. ''I know my state very well.''</p>
        <p>Asked how often he takes advice from Mr. Clinton, Tony Coelho, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, said: ''I'm not going to go there.''</p>
