        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The missile-defense debate (news article, May 2) has been too narrowly focused on costly high-technology efforts to intercept missiles. Two other approaches should be further explored. One is classic strategic deterrence, which worked for decades with the Soviet Union. The second is pre-emptive strikes against threatening missile facilities, which are hard to conceal and are for now vulnerable to conventional attack.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The missile-defense debate (news article, May 2) has been too narrowly focused on costly high-technology efforts to intercept missiles. Two other approaches should be further explored. One is classic strategic deterrence, which worked for decades with the Soviet Union. The second is pre-emptive strikes against threatening missile facilities, which are hard to conceal and are for now vulnerable to conventional attack.</p>
        <p>European uneasiness with the current American approach is understandable. Beyond the fear of being left ''uncovered'' by an American missile shield, negotiated changes in the Antiballistic Missile Treaty that give Russia the right to deploy an equivalent shield could in time undermine the viability of the much smaller British and French nuclear deterrents.</p>
