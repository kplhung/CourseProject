        <p>FAITH'' speaks to the converted. The mammoth show at the Aldrich Museum of American Art in Ridgefield is for those who believe that a theme show can hold a wide variety of work, even that which is only obliquely related to the topic.</p>
        <p>The show's intent is stated in its subtitle, ''The Impact of Judeo-Christian Religion on Art at the Millennium.'' It's a tall order, but the Aldrich is a past master of big themes. Last summer the museum examined the impact of sex on contemporary art. We can hope to be spared the impact of politics.</p>
        <p>A perennial, winning attribute of the Aldrich is that its shows are never as ponderous as their titles might indicate. They always contain a broad streak of humor and wit. ''Faith'' is no exception. For instance, one of the artists, the Rev. Ethan Acres, aims, ''to put the fun back in fundamentalism.'' But just as a lot of religious doctrine and ritual is esoteric, so is much of the art.</p>
        <p>The largest work, in size and perhaps in intent, is outdoors, in the museum's backyard. Osvaldo Romberg has created what looks like an irregularly-shaped corral made of stacked-up wood. It has the primal, mysterious allure associated with Stonehenge. The Aldrich continues its practice of publishing a card of explanatory notes, free for the taking, next to every work. This insures that nothing is a barrier to appreciation, that viewers will have at least a clue to what is going on. We discover that Mr. Romberg, like several of the other artists, has grown out of the confines of the exhibition's theme: the piece is based on the overlapping outlines of a synagogue in Poland, a cathedral in Milan, but also a Buddhist temple in Tibet and a mosque in Iran.</p>
        <p>Inside the museum are a few other environments. Michael Tracy, a Texan who lives near the Mexican border, has created what he calls an actual chapel, not an installation evoking one. He says that it's a part of his own house, so he has lived in it. Mr. Tracy heightens the Mexican tendency to be intensely decorative and he is unabashedly frank, sometimes to the point of ghoulishness. Several sculptures evoke torture; heads are pierced with many spikes. The piece is dedicated to victims of the many recent wars and political skirmishes in Latin America.</p>
        <p>Much more somber and sober in appearance, but likewise tumultuous, are Helen Aylon's ''Notebooks.'' Ms. Aylon recreates the ambience of her eighth-grade class at a school for girls in 1944. The teachers were all women, but they taught only the commentary of Orthodox rabbis. The artist is imagining what might have happened if the female voice had been permitted, or what might happen in the future. This conundrum is embodied in a wall hung with empty notebooks. Hebrew written on a blackboard is a challenge to the next generation of Jews to re-evaluate their religious practices.</p>
        <p>Sylvie Blocher's video installation, which contains monitors positioned around a room, features members of the Princeton football team spouting their opinions about art. Ms. Blocher thus neatly evokes two non-standard religions: football, which has a lot of American adherents, and art, which one suspects may be where Ms. Blocher's faith lies.</p>
        <p>Several of the more contained works, or single objects, hit their mark. Claude Simard's ''Pulpit,'' life size and handsomely made out of mahogany, is a spiral staircase, but at the top there's no place from which to preach. Francesc Torre's battered, wooden school desk has a metal snake perched on it, ready to query anyone who sits down. Nicholas Kripal has made scale-model concrete casts of four major Italian cathedrals. Turned upside down and filled with water, these casts become fonts, and Mr. Kripal gets a lot of mileage out of just presenting the potent symbol of water in a terse, intriguing way.</p>
        <p>Two huge gongs with hammers just ask to be struck. Jaume Plensa has labeled one ''born'' the other ''die,'' and the accompanying text reminds us that in Asia gongs are struck to announce important events.</p>
        <p>Keith Milow exhibits four simple crosses; three are made of iron on wood while the other is iron powder, resin and fiberglass. Mr. Milow's crisp craftsmanship has resulted in objects that, even in the context of the show, allude more to classical geometry than to Christian symbolism.</p>
        <p>John B. Giuliani's meticulous paintings recast familiar New Testament stories into Hopi costume, and the ingenuousness is disarming. Likewise sincere -- and penetrating -- are Clara Gutsche's richly colored photographs of nuns in several convents in Canada. Ms. Gutsche is interested in off-hand, mundane moments, and she catches the abiding  faith of her subjects.</p>
        <p>Viewers might feel in need of a shoehorn to fit other pieces into the theme. We're told that Christian Eckart's gleaming monochrome paintings that, because of their curved edges resemble lacquered ashtrays, might stimulate a mystical experience.</p>
        <p>James Turrell, who is known for his masterful and massive works involving light, has collaborated with a potter and a woodworker to make ceramic ware and furniture designed ''with the Quaker aesthetic of simplicity and plainness.'' It's a nice evocation, but many finely-crafted utilitarian objects with no higher claims resemble Mr. Turrell's.</p>
        <p>Petah Coyne's white plaster wall, with fluted columns at either end, evokes in its title both the the Virgin Mary and Marilyn Monroe. The fluting or pleating might refer to the traditional robes of the Virgin Mary and maybe simultaneously to the billowing white skirt Monroe wore in ''The Seven Year Itch.''</p>
        <p>Unless it's a maudlin one, however, the link between saint and celebrity would seem to dead-end here.</p>
        <p>''Faith: The Impact of Judeo-Christian Religion on Contemporary Art'' is at the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art in Ridgefield through May 28.</p>
        <p>ART  Correction:  May 14, 2000, Sunday  An art review last Sunday about the exhibition ''Faith: The Impact of Judeo-Christian Religion on Art at the Millennium'' misstated the name of the museum in Ridgefield. It is the Aldrich Museum of Contemporary Art, not American art.</p>
