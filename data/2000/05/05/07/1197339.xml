        <p>ALAN HEDGES is a carpenter who hates the idea of cutting down trees.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hedges is not alone, and that is why artisans from New Jersey and around the country are joining a group that certifies forest products harvested by what it considers environmentally responsible companies.</p>
        <p>For carpenters and artisans who produce high-end furniture and boats, the use of such stylish hardwoods as mahogany (only from Brazil), teak (mainly from Southeast Asia), American oak and cherrywoods and other forest products is a must.</p>
        <p>''I started worrying about it when I found out that what they call Honduran mahogany is really from the rain forests in Brazil where they were clear-cutting and leaving it a wasteland,'' Mr. Hedges said. ''I didn't want to lose jobs, but I wanted to really be sure that the wood I was buying had been harvested by a supplier that was replanting trees, thinning out trees and not clear-cutting.''</p>
        <p>Then he found out about the Certified Forest Products Council, a nonprofit group seeking solutions for harvesters and  craftsmen alike.</p>
        <p>The Certified Forest Products Council of Beaverton, Ore., hires independent companies to examine the practices and forest management of companies that cut and sell wood. Its Web site -- www.certifiedwood.org -- lists certified suppliers of wood around the world. By August, the organization hopes to have a searchable database that allows buyers from weekend handymen to corporations to search out species by state and country and see which companies sell certified goods.</p>
        <p>The group is the result of a merger of the Forest Product Buyers' Group, which was formed in Delaware in 1987 and later moved its headquarters to Oregon, and the Good Wood Alliance, a woodworker and artisan group formed in 1989 in Burlington, Vt. The two groups came together in 1997 under the guidance of David Ford, the president of the group who earned a degree in forestry from Urbana College in Illinois and spent years working for the forest products industry.</p>
        <p>''I have had a lot of people I used to work for in the forest products industry say I turned on them,'' Mr. Ford said in a telephone interview from his office in Oregon. ''I think we really need tools for collaborative solutions instead of just having everybody fighting all the time.''</p>
        <p>The group gained prominence in 1999 when Home Depot announced it would sell only wood bearing the CFPC approval.</p>
        <p>''It's using your wallet to vote for responsible forest management,'' Mr. Ford said. ''By not asking where the wood comes from you unwittingly contribute to the destruction of the world's forests. We need more people, like Alan Hedges, to get interested in this issue and make this kind of sound environmental decision.''</p>
