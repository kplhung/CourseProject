        <p>Last Nov. 23, shares of AT&amp;T hit $53, and Donald L. Luskin, manager of the $35 million OpenFund, was engulfed in doubt. A month and a half earlier, he had sold the stock short at $46.50, betting that it would fall.</p>
        <p>But it was heading up. Moreover, Mr. Luskin lives in a glass house, by mutual fund standards: OpenFund, which started last year, posts all its investment decisions on its Web site daily, lets the public post opinions of its performance and even has a Webcam on its trading floor.</p>
        <p>Now the public was talking back.</p>
        <p>''It's time to eat crow and cover the short,'' one visitor wrote. ''I'm thinking about it, I'm thinking about it!'' Mr. Luskin wrote back. Indeed, he has added to and covered part of the short position at various times over recent months. On March 29, when AT&amp;T hit $61, another visitor accused Mr. Luskin of being ''obsessed'' with AT&amp;T.</p>
        <p>Last week, Mr. Luskin was vindicated. AT&amp;T announced that its earnings and revenue growth for the remainder of the year would fall short of analysts' expectations. The stock fell 18 percent for the week, closing on Friday at $38.4375, and Mr. Luskin, who had last added to his short position when the stock hit $58.50 on March 29, had a tidy $98,983 profit as of Friday, not including trading costs.</p>
        <p>And he is maintaining a short position on the stock. ''The company is sitting on a huge legacy of network architecture,'' Mr. Luskin said in an interview. ''Everything about the way it connects people is three or four generations old. It's America's most unnecessary company.''</p>
