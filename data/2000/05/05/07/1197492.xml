        <p>CALLE OCHO  * [Rating: One Star]  (212) 873-5025; 446 Columbus Avenue, between 81st and 82nd Streets; $$: smoking at the bar and lounge; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Calle Ocho's style of cooking fits the neighborhood like a well-made suit. It gets its name from the main street of Little Havana in Miami, and the Nuevo Latino cooking has brought downtown-style excitement to the Upper West Side. Appetizers include Peruvian shrimp chowder with achiote oil; Caribbean lobster ceviche in a passion fruit mojo; sweet corn and goat cheese tamal, shrimp enchilada and pumpkin seed pesto; and a classic Spanish stew of littleneck clams, spicy chorizo and white beans. Entrees include pan-seared grouper, poblano mashed potatoes, tomato relish and toasted cumin vinaigrette; Cuban-style steak frites with yuca fries; and banana-leaf-wrapped black bass, stir-fry of hearts of palm, crab and lobster with a sea urchin butter. (Review: 7/28/99)</p>
        <p>DIWAN'S CURRY HOUSE  +  (212) 721-3400; 302 Columbus Avenue, at 74th Street, $$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>This Indian restaurant is unusual for two reasons. Pork spareribs and a dining room decorated in a zebra-skin motif are things you almost never see in Indian restaurants. The menu's more conventional items can be excellent, like katori chat and bhel poori. Appetizers include tandoori gulf shrimp; cashew nut rolls; crab chili fry (crab meat, spices, coconut and mustard with a hint of tamarind); and spicy barbecued ribs. Entrees include tandoori prawns; paneer kesari (saffron-flavored homemade cheese and an almond sauce); eggplant bhurta, with onions, tomatoes, ginger, chilies and herbs; and malai kofta (potato and cheese dumplings stuffed with apricots in a cashew nut sauce). ($25 and Under: 4/12/00)</p>
        <p>ISOLA  +++  (212) 362-7400; 485 Columbus Avenue, between 83rd and 84th Streets; $$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>This restaurant offers some of the best Italian food on the Upper West Side, with lively pastas, individual pizzas and a nicely chosen wine list.  Appetizers include fresh homemade mozzarella with roasted tomatoes and peppers; grilled portobello mushroom on a bed of white beans; and grilled calamari over a bed of couscous. Entrees include grilled sirloin steak with arugula, tomatoes and roasted potatoes; breaded, pounded veal served with arugula and tomatoes; veal scaloppine with lemon and artichoke hearts; and grilled yellowfin tuna steak with lemon, olive oil, garlic and fresh herbs. (New York Today: April 1998)</p>
        <p>MUGHLAI  +  (212) 724-6363; 320 Columbus Avenue, at 75th Street; $$; no smoking; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>Mughlai is clearly a restaurant that struggles with the question of compromise. Its menu, for instance, offers familiar Indian dishes, yet it also invites diners to try regional dishes that you almost never see at other restaurants. Appetizers include shrimps flavored with garlic, curry leaves and mustard seeds in a zesty sauce; an assortment of shish kebab, chicken tikka, chicken winglets and fish tikka; and keema samosas, ground lamb cooked with a blend of spices wrapped in a light crispy crust. Entrees include lamb marinated in fennel, ginger, yogurt and exotic spices cooked in a light sauce; saag gosht, a blend of lamb smothered in cream spinach; shrimp jalfrezi, shrimps stir-fried with fresh vegetables in a sweet and sour sauce; and murg makhanwalla, boneless tandoori chicken poached in a rich tomato sauce flavored with fenugreek leaves. ($25 and Under: 12/22/99)</p>
        <p>OCEAN GRILL  ++  (212) 579-2300; 384 Columbus Avenue, between 78th and 79th Streets; $$$; smoking at the bar; all major credit cards.</p>
        <p>This moderately priced seafood restaurant is a welcome addition to the Upper West Side. Appetizers include lobster bisque; bamboo-steamed shrimp dumplings with spicy Asian dipping sauce; and sesame-crusted lobster roll with sweet pepper glaze. Entrees include pan seared mahi-mahi with golden leek mashed potatoes and a savory lobster, corn and asparagus ragout; blackened swordfish with sweet potato crab meat hash; and grilled filet mignon with wild mushrooms, sauteed spinach and hash browns.
