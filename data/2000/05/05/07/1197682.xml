        <p>The Irish Republican Army offered today to open its secret arsenal of weapons to international inspection as a way of meeting peace negotiators' demands that it ''completely and verifiably'' put its arms beyond use.</p>
        <p>The statement from the underground organization was issued just 12 hours after Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, made a public call to the group for such reassurance, and it lifted hopes of ending the deadlock over disarmament that has frozen progress on the Northern Ireland peace agreement.</p>
        <p>It was the first time that the I.R.A. had ever explicitly addressed the crucial and emotive subject of disarmament, and the proposals went further than even the group's main political representative, Gerry Adams, the Sinn Fein president, had said anyone could expect.</p>
        <p>The I.R.A. also said it would reappoint representatives to the independent disarmament commission that it broke contact with in February after Britain put the power-sharing government in Belfast on hold after only eight weeks. Britain said it based that action on the I.R.A.'s failure to make expected moves on weapons.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair and Mr. Ahern said early today that they hoped to restore the home rule government by May 22, and they set out a new timetable pushing back until June 2001 the deadline for a number of measures intended to secure peace for Ulster.</p>
        <p>Those steps include the disposal of paramilitary weapons, a greater reduction in British troops in the province, a new police force with more balanced membership among Roman Catholic and Protestant officers and new human rights provisions.</p>
        <p>David Trimble, leader of the province's largest Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, greeted today's statement with customary wariness, but he said it was welcome, and he promised that his party would give it serious attention. If he goes forward, Mr. Trimble will have to overcome the deep reluctance of a significant minority in his party to re-enter government with their Sinn Fein rivals without an actual handover of guns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trimble said: ''It does appear to break new ground. There are some quite positive elements in it.'' He added, however, that ''there are points that we want to tease out the meaning of.''</p>
        <p>John Hume, leader of the moderate Catholic Social Democratic and Labor Party, was asked by the BBC today what he would say to Mr. Trimble, with whom he shared the 1998 Nobel Peace Prize. He replied, ''I would say to David that I think this is what they have been waiting for.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hume added, ''I think it is making very clear that the gun has been taken out of Irish politics forever.'' He said the most significant part of the statement was ''that they are going to put their guns beyond use, and they are going to have that verified.''</p>
        <p>The quick sequence of events followed a familiar pattern in the last years of the Northern Ireland peace talks where months of stalemates, exchanges of accusations and gloomy predictions are broken by spurts of activity that raise hopes of an end to sectarian conflict that has cost more than 3,600 lives.</p>
        <p>David McClartey, an Ulster Unionist legislator from the suspended assembly, said he and colleagues had emerged from a quick meeting feeling encouraged by the I.R.A. statement. ''I think there was a degree of positivity about this statement which hasn't been there before,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Jeffrey Donaldson, the most prominent hard-line unionist dissident, made it clear that he would challenge any attempt by Mr. Trimble to take the party back into government based on today's statement. ''It would appear that the proposals on arms fall well short of what unionists have been looking for throughout this process,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adams, the Sinn Fein president, presented today's statement as a triumph. ''I know there have been some who have been skeptical about whether republicans, the Irish Republican Army in particular, were really interested in this process,'' he said. ''I think today's statement shows that they are.''</p>
        <p>Up until Friday, Mr. Adams had been warning against expectations that the I.R.A. could respond to the demands for a statement on arms. Today he said: ''This is not an abstract, historical kind of thing, a dry turning over of the page. This is a life and death, blood and sinew, emotional and painful step for the I.R.A. to make because it wants this to work.''</p>
        <p>Prime Minister Ahern of Ireland called on unionists to view today's development positively, saying the statement ''had all the clarity that people have looked for in the last 12 months or so,'' and adding, ''We've put a lot of effort in to try to get this issue addressed.''</p>
        <p>He said unionists who might be uncertain about whether to accept the deal should remember how far Northern Ireland has come since the peace talks began. ''There is now very little violence, tourism is beginning to flourish, and economic activity is moving up,'' he said. ''People want to move away from the past.''</p>
        <p>The British and Irish, who are sponsors of the talks that resulted in the April 1998 peace accord, announced that the promised inspections of the arms dumps would be led by two outsiders. They are Martti Ahtisaari, the former Finnish president who served as a special United Nations peacemaker during NATO's war with Yugoslavia over Kosovo last year, and Cyril Ramaphosa, former secretary general of the African National Congress in South Africa, who helped to end apartheid.</p>
        <p>The two men will report to the independent international commission that has been charged with supervising the disarming of the paramilitary groups. ''The dumps will be re-inspected regularly to insure that the weapons have remained secure,'' the I.R.A. statement said.</p>
        <p>The naming of two foreigners as  third parties continued a tradition in the continuing effort to end the conflict in Northern Ireland where outsiders are called in to mediate the major disputes between the province's two deeply distrustful communities. The head of the disarmament panel is a Canadian, Gen. John de Chastelain, and the broker of the original agreement was former Senator George J. Mitchell.</p>
        <p>The Northern Ireland peace settlement is an attempt to balance the desires of republicans, most of whom are Catholics, to draw closer to and one day merge with the Irish Republic, with those of the largely Protestant unionists, who want Ulster to remain part of Britain.</p>
        <p>The original agreement and the referendums and votes that followed have brought a large measure of political stability to Northern Ireland and have drastically reduced violence. The I.R.A. and the Protestant paramilitary groups have maintained cease-fires for nearly three years.</p>
        <p>In its statement, the I.R.A. said it would make sure that there was no ''misappropriation by others'' of its weapons, a reference to public concern over renegade guerrilla groups that object to the cease-fires and seek to bring the whole peace settlement down with acts of violence. Four months after the signing of the accord, one such group, the Real I.R.A., set off a car bomb in the town of Omagh that killed 29 people and wounded more than 200.</p>
        <p>Progress has continually come to a halt over the issue of disarmament, with unionists arguing that they cannot serve in government with Sinn Fein as long as it has its ''private army,'' and republicans countering with the claim that the cease-fire itself, which they call the ''silence of the guns,'' is sufficient proof of their commitment to peace.</p>
        <p>The Sinn Fein leadership has tried to persuade the I.R.A. to begin disarming, and according to British security sources, almost succeeded in January but failed to get unanimous backing from members of the ruling council. Mr. Adams is known to fear provoking any divisions in the ranks because of the republican movement's history of violent fallouts.</p>
        <p>The republican reluctance to disarm stems from a feeling that the I.R.A. is an undefeated army and from a resistance to taking part in any action that could be construed as surrendering.</p>
        <p>The pressure in recent months to get the settlement process up and running again has been on Sinn Fein, but today's statement shifts the focus to the Ulster Unionists.</p>
        <p>At the last meeting of the party's governing council, Mr. Trimble kept his leadership with only 57 percent of the delegates' votes after being challenged by an uninspiring former grand master of the militant Orange Order, who played on widespread resentment in the party over what critics view as Mr. Trimble's excessive willingness to make concessions to republicans.</p>
        <p>The I.R.A. statement made a rare positive reference to unionists, saying, ''The full implementation, on a progressive and irreversible basis by the two governments, especially the British government, of what they have agreed will provide a political context, in an enduring political process, with the potential to remove the causes of conflict, and in which Irish republicans, and unionists can, as equals, pursue our respective political objectives peacefully.''</p>
        <p>In a written statement today, President Clinton called the I.R.A.'s disarmament announcement a ''significant step'' and a cause for optimism.</p>
        <p>A senior Clinton administration official said today's announcement was the first time the I.R.A. has put out a ''clear and unequivocal'' statement about moving forward with the peace effort and renewing ''confidence'' by permitting inspections of its secret weapons stockpiles.</p>
        <p>''You have a sense that it's going to begin, and they are committed to go all the way through,'' said the official. ''Both of these things have been the keys to getting a real clarity about what the I.R.A.'s intenions are.''</p>
