        <p>Tuckerton Seaport opens this weekend to illustrate how fishermen, crabbers, clammers and boat builders have lived at the  Jersey Shore since the late 1600's. The area began with the Barnegat Bay Decoy and Baymen's Museum, now incorporated into the seaport complex. The 16-acre area is only the beginning of what is set to be a 30-building complex.</p>
        <p>John Gormley, executive director of the seaport, talked recently about the attraction.  Q. How did the seaport get its start?  A. There were seven of us, including my twin brother, Tom, who got together in a friend's kitchen to talk about starting a gunning club and buying a hunting shanty to teach waterfowl traditions to other people in the area. The bay is in the blood of everybody down here, and every time we got together our numbers grew. We started talking about teaching oystering, clamming, fishing, and boat building and pretty soon the Barnegat Bay Decoy and Baymen's Museum was born.</p>
        <p>Then we found out the property here on Tuckerton Creek was for sale for development. We met with Senator Leonard Connors, who was interested in the project, and it started to grow from there. We started getting grants and donations. We have now bought 40 acres of land and built or renovated 13 buildings. Phase one cost $8.6 million, including dredging Tuckerton Creek and building boardwalks and bulkheading.  Q. What does the seaport illustrate?  A. Each building shows some aspect of life on the bay. Tucker's Island Lighthouse has been rebuilt, and that is where the museum exhibits are housed, including real pictures of the original lighthouse as it fell into the bay during a storm in 1927. We recreated Perrine Boat Works where Hazelton Seaman built the sneakbox, a flat-bottomed boat designed specifically for the shallow water of Barnegat Bay. We will have classes in sneakbox building. Joe Dayton's Sawmill will show how Jersey Cedar and white oak were milled for boats. Decoy carvers will exhibit their talent at Hurley Conklin's Decoy Shop. The sea captain's house is being restored for administrative offices. At Parson's Clam and Oyster House we will demonstrate the art of dredging for clams and oysters just as they did when Tuckerton was known as Clamtown. This is a museum and teaching community. It is not a shopping center or amusement park. We have one small concession stand and we have Skeeters Seafood Cafe and Snack Bar where authentic bay seafood will be sold.  Q. Are there environmental exhibits?  A. The Tuckerton Yacht Club will house the Coastal Environmental Interpretive Center, which will have displays and a maritime research library. Rutgers Institute of Marine and Coastal Sciences and Richard Stockton College are partners in this with us. There is an ecotour along Great Bay Boulevard where you can hike, drive or bicycle to see native plants and animals.  Q. What will be added in the future?  A. A whaling center will show how pioneer families worked in the shore whaling industry that flourished between the 1690's and the 1830's. An ice house will show how unique ice tools were made here. A customs house will show how this area was a port of entry for the United States for many years. A lifesaving station will display the equipment that was developed here such as the Breeches Buoy and the life car used by the U.S. Life Saving Service, which was started here. We also want to renovate the homestead of Andrews Bartlett, a house built in 1699, to show how people lived, as well as how they worked the cycle, hunting in the fall, cutting cedar in winter and spring, and clamming in the summer.</p>
