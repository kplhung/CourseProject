        <p>Accusations of a ''secret plan'' that would bankrupt Social Security. Intimations of a laxity in the war on drugs. Allegations that gun lobbyists would be virtual residents of the Oval Office.</p>
        <p>Vice President Al Gore went on the offensive again and again last week, using a series of campaign appearances across the country not only to advance his own policy initiatives, but to sow suspicion about the goals of his presumed opponent in the general election, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas.</p>
        <p>''Maybe he would pick Charlton Heston as the next surgeon general,'' Mr. Gore said in Chicago, referring to the financial backing Republicans are getting from the National Rifle Association, whose president is Mr. Heston.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's hammering away was a leading indicator of a new, more aggressive phase of the campaign. The retreat of Elian Gonzalez with his father to a Maryland estate seems to have opened up space again on America's front page for campaign machinations, much of them testier. In California, a conservative group, Shape the Debate, has begun running anti-Gore commercials; last week, Handgun Control introduced a spot that said Mr. Bush had signed a law that allows concealed guns in churches and amusement parks.</p>
        <p>The ammunition for Mr. Gore's attack was provided on Wednesday, when it was disclosed that the nation's gun companies had broken off settlement talks with 31 municipalities across the nation over lawsuits relating to gun violence, in hopes Mr. Bush would win the presidency and usher in a more favorable environment. (In other signs of the changing environment, a panel of Republicans proposed altering the current primary system, to allow only smaller states to vote first.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, meanwhile, professed to be unfazed by Mr. Gore's jabs, although he couldn't help expressing some disgust. ''Totally pathetic,'' Mr. Bush said to a reporter after being informed that Mr. Gore tells Hispanic audiences that he had hoped his second grandchild would be born on Cinco de Mayo.</p>
