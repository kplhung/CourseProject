        <p>Folk singer-guitarist Mary Lou Lord is set to perform at Internet Cafe in Red Bank, NJ (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Straight from the school of breathy singer-songwriters comes Mary Lou Lord, who will appear at the Internet Cafe in Red Bank on Wednesday at 7 p.m. Her voice has the same whispery quality as Suzanne Vega's and Juliana Hatfield's, but she doesn't quite reach their lyrical bite or musical innovation.</p>
        <p>For this folkie troubadour there's just enough twang in her guitar, ample attitude in her lyrics and sufficient melody in her songs to make her the darling of the acoustic-based alternative scene. She enjoys singing covers from respected indie writers like Daniel and Freedy Johnston (a throwback to her Boston busking days), and her live performance often seems like spur-of-the-moment events.</p>

        <p>As uncertain as she might seem on stage, this is a young performer who (as she sings in ''I'm Talking To You'') is a guitar-playing girl on a mission. Lucky fans sometimes catch one of those performances when she just takes requests. If her low-key indie approach is too underwhelming, just sit at one of the computers and log on to Fiona Apple's site.</p>
