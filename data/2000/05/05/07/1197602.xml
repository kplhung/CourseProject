        <p>When her son was shot to death by another child showing off his father's 9-millimeter pistol at playtime, Carole Price decided to seek some rustic peace in the country.</p>
        <p>''We moved here to get away from everything,'' said Mrs. Price, wearing a lapel-pin photo of her beaming 13-year-old son, John. He was shot in the head two years ago in a Baltimore suburb by a 9-year-old neighbor who thought the gun was empty when he found it resting alluringly in his father's night stand.</p>
        <p>''But we did not realize what we were moving into out here,'' Mrs. Price said. She now clearly knows, she said, sure as her son was one of 12 children killed daily by gunshot in the United States, that there is no way to escape the harrowing aberrations of the gun culture.</p>
        <p>Dotting the byways of the rolling green countryside here in Carroll County, near the Pennsylvania border, Mrs. Price, 37, soon began noticing postings by gun clubs and enthusiasts for frequent weekend shooting contests. ''Then I saw that the Republican county committee was raffling off a 9-millimeter handgun for a political fund-raiser,'' she said. ''I went through the roof.''</p>
        <p>Accordingly, with two remaining children to protect, Mrs. Price soon became one of the state organizers of the Million Mom March, scheduled for May 14 in Washington. A promised throng of hundreds of thousands there and in 59 other cities will issue a unified demand in the name of Mother's Day that politicians find the will to regulate guns and their users as thoroughly as automobiles and drivers are regulated.</p>
        <p>After dealing with exaggerated crowd estimates and warnings of disruption at the recent World Bank protest in Washington, officials there are saying the Mother's Day march could prove the real sleeper protest of the spring marching season. The multicity crowds from all manner of family, kith and kin are determined to force the gun control issue higher up the political agenda, led by mothers wheeling offspring toward Capitol Hill in phalanxes of strollers.</p>
        <p>A counterdemonstration, the Armed Informed Mothers March, is being promised in several cities by Second Amendment Sisters, a pro-gun women's group newly formed in Dallas (www.sas-aim.org). Million Mom organizers say they welcome the challenge as a chance to let politicians measure where the sympathies of most women lie.</p>
        <p>The Washington organizers are emphasizing that Mother's Day originated after the Civil War not as some nosegay commemorative day but as a practical calling from the heart for mothers in the sundered nation to take care of one another's wounded sons. Mrs. Price reflects some battlefield grit of her own.</p>
        <p>''That 9-millimeter they raffled off was the same kind of gun my child died from, and here were my representatives fund-raising with one,'' she said, explaining how her organizational fury came to be stoked by the sight of elected county officials making an American political gala of a handgun raffle.</p>
        <p>In fact, the organizers claimed a far larger booty than expected, happily telling Mrs. Price that it was because she organized a protest of a half-dozen friends and relatives and attracted extra publicity.</p>
        <p>''They were coming out and calling us communists and saying, 'You made us a lot of money,' '' Mrs. Price said. ''One guy screamed in my face to get out of town.'' The flinty mother smiled tightly at this idea as the very last thing she would ever do. ''I don't understand what they're scared of about me,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''The best thing is I've got three buses going from Carroll County,'' she said of 150 local people signed up for the Washington march. ''Not many men; it's the women, and a lot of them are saying, 'I hope my husband doesn't find out.' ''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Price hopes they do, for the goal of the organizers is nothing less than to drive gun control as the decisive issue in the presidential and Congressional elections.</p>
        <p>Nine months ago, the idea of the march was broached by Donna Dees-Thomases, a New Jersey mother, in Internet chats among women appalled by the relentless pace of child shootings. The organizers rallied round the searing image of terrified youngsters holding hands and running for their lives in a day camp shooting in the Granada Hills section of Los Angeles on Aug. 10.</p>
        <p>''It steals your heart and your soul when you lose your child,'' said Mrs. Price, who is hoping for something far more compelling from women voters this year than the usual ''soccer mom'' bromides.</p>
        <p>''I figure 10,000 alone from Maryland,'' said Mrs. Price, noting Washington is the recommended destination for anyone within a 10-hour journey. More distant protesters are advised by the march headquarters (www.millionmommarch.com) to join parallel protests in scores of regional capitals across the nation.</p>
        <p>''We're telling the politicians we're serious; we don't want to bury any more of our kids,'' Mrs. Price said.</p>
