        <p>THE International Society of Travel Medicine has spent hours of its biennial conventions since it was formed in 1989 debating how to tell people that travel in the developing world is not like being in Kansas: that malaria is a reality in particular areas, that motor-vehicle crashes are a more severe hazard than Japanese encephalitis, that diarrhea is a frequent problem in the tropics. Slips inserted into airline ticket jackets were discussed, as well as in-flight filmstrips, data sheets to be distributed by travel agents or even folders for brochure racks.</p>

        <p>THE International Society of Travel Medicine has spent hours of its biennial conventions since it was formed in 1989 debating how to tell people that travel in the developing world is not like being in Kansas: that malaria is a reality in particular areas, that motor-vehicle crashes are a more severe hazard than Japanese encephalitis, that diarrhea is a frequent problem in the tropics. Slips inserted into airline ticket jackets were discussed, as well as in-flight filmstrips, data sheets to be distributed by travel agents or even folders for brochure racks.</p>
        <p>Nothing seemed to overcome the reluctance of the natural intermediaries -- airlines, travel agents and tour operators -- to cloud their ''fly with me'' message by saying that paradise has a few bugs in it.</p>
        <p>Then came the Internet. And the same popular tools that prospective travelers use to shop at 1 a.m. for interesting itineraries and cheap fares and hotel rooms provide access to medical information, good and bad, without intermediaries.</p>
        <p>As always on the Web, sorting out the authoritative sites from the sea of information is not always easy. But when medical Web sites are reliable and backed by solid research, they are a no-cost source of vital information and searchable lists of travel clinics where one can get inoculations, prescriptions and post-travel help. They also permit shopping online for gadgets or books, and link into government Web sites that offer help, both medical and practical -- where to get a visa, for example.</p>
        <p>The Web has changed the way experts deliver travel medicine, according to Dr. Bradley Connor of New York, head of the public education committee of the International Society for Travel Medicine. ''I can get an e-mail from a client in Indonesia,'' he said, ''and give him help easily. It is so much better than the 3 a.m. phone call.''</p>
        <p>Here is a guide to a choice few sites on travel health.</p>
        <p>The Yellow Book</p>
        <p>The mother lode in this field is ''Health Information for International Travel,'' researched and issued by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. In print, it is known as the Yellow Book. Online, at www.cdc .gov/travel, its home page is slicker, with tropical fish and blue panels.</p>
        <p>Because this material is in the public domain, it is the resource travel writers draw on first. It hews to United States rules in not recommending, for example, medicines or treatments not approved by the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
        <p>The current edition is 1999-2000, and Dr. Martin S. Cetron, acting deputy director of the division of quarantine at the C.D.C., said that a hard issue was whether to update the online version with, for example, later immunization decisions.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cetron is in negotiation with several dot-com companies that want access to the Yellow Book beyond a simple hyperlink, which is provided now on some Web sites -- www.travelmed.com, for example. ''We have progressed from giving advice on the voice phone to providing faxes upon automated phone order to going online,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cetron said that the government could not enter into an exclusive agreement with any company, and so he was talking to all the major players. This includes www .medicineplanet.com, a brand-new Web site, and www.ijet.com, a site that will not emerge until fall.</p>
        <p>As it is now, the online Yellow Book has many bonuses for travelers: the Green Sheets, giving scores on government cruise-ship inspections, and the Blue Sheets, which update cholera, yellow fever and plague reports. The site is searchable by destination and by disease.</p>
        <p>For those still in fiber mode, the book, stock number 017-023-00202-3, costs $22 from the Superintendent of Documents, Washington, D.C. 20402; with a credit card, (202) 512-1800.</p>
        <p>Medicineplanet</p>
        <p>Www.medicineplanet.com opened officially in mid-March. It is large, with articles on a wide number of issues, including, as an example, emergency contraception. This article, under Women's Travel Center, by Dr. Susan Anderson, a clinical assistant professor at the Stanford Medical School in California, is detailed and includes charts with dosages and timing. This is not a topic the Yellow Book touches.</p>
        <p>Medicineplanet is focused on the San Francisco area; its chief executive officer is identified as Dr. Jordan Shlain, Lufthansa's medical director in California. Editorial material is approved by Dr. David Shlim, who directed a clinic in Nepal for years and is a recognized authority on high-mountain illness. The editorial board includes Dr. Martin Wolfe, a State Department consultant who is considered the father of travel medicine as a discipline.</p>
        <p>The Web site was created and set up with venture capital. It has three partners: American Express, which is selling travel medical insurance, but not trip-cancellation coverage, on the site; SelfCare.com, some of whose online catalog items are being offered; and Ericsson Australia, a branch of the cell phone company, that expects by the Olympics this fall to offer information from the site to users of its telephones in Australia. Ann E. Trunko, Medicineplanet marketing director, said that this service would enable Ericsson clients in a pharmacy to dial a number to learn what name to use for a drug known only by its United States name.</p>
        <p>The Web site is easy to use. The authors are well identified, and the country-specific information on infectious diseases is extensive. Dr. Stephen W. Hargarten, chairman of the emergency medicine department of the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee, was less enthusiastic about the information on vehicular safety, which he found too generic. Dr. Hargarten, whose specialty is travelers' injuries, said that www .asirt.org, (Association for Safe International Road Travel) had road information for many countries. This site was established by Rochelle  Sobel, whose son died in a bus crash in Turkey five years ago, and is maintained as a volunteer effort. Updating seems to be sporadic; sample material on Turkey had not been revised for some time. Reports from other countries are available, and users are asked to sign up and make a donation.</p>
        <p>Other Specialists</p>
        <p>The Web simplifies the search for a travel clinic, although all the sites with searchable lists add warnings that they do not guarantee the care provided. Ms. Trunko said medicineplanet's list was compiled from other lists and then checked by telephone. The International Society of Travel Medicine now maintains its list, sorted by country and by state within the United States, on the Web only, at www.istm.org.</p>
        <p>Also on the association site are articles from the Journal of Travel Medicine, a peer-reviewed publication. The most recent issue includes an article about young volunteers who contracted dengue fever in one of the British Virgin Islands and others, elsewhere on the island, who did not.</p>
        <p>The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene also has a clinic list at www.astmh.org. Most of the major problems in travel occur in the tropics, although high-mountain sickness, diphtheria in Russia, hypothermia in cold climes and injuries anywhere are part of the picture. Tropical medicine specialists often have an additional specialty, or, like Dr. Wolfe, end up counseling people going almost everywhere.</p>
        <p>Travel Medicine Inc. in Northampton, Mass., was created 10 years ago by Dr. Stuart R. Rose to publish his book, ''International Travel Health Guide,'' now in its 11th edition.  The organization's Web site, www .travelmed.com, noted above as one with links to the C.D.C. book, sells the Rose book and a number of travel items like insecticides. This organization is taking over publication of the Traveling Healthy newsletter, edited by Dr. Karl Neumann, a pediatrician. The newsletter will appear on the Web in the near future, Dr. Neumann said. Dr. Neumann frequently leads travel medicine panels on children and insect repellents.</p>
        <p>The Web site of the International Association for Medical Assistance to Travelers, an organization that  exists on voluntary contributions, does not put everything on line at www.sentex.net/iamat. It includes good samples of its literature, including maps and color diagrams. But the material most people want is the directory of English-speaking physicians around the world who agree to modest fees, from $55 for an office visit to $95 for house calls at night and on Sundays and holidays. This directory is not online; it is mailed to new members with an appeal for help to build a center for the study of travel and geographical health.</p>
        <p>M. Assunta Uffer-Marcolongo, the widow of the founder, Dr. Vincenzo Marcolongo, continues the group's work as a memorial to him and others who helped set it up. The old-  style mail address is 417 Center Street, Lewiston, N.Y. 14092 or  40 Regal Road, Guelph, Ontario,  Canada N1K 1B5.</p>
