        <p>It's about as unlikely a promotional gimmick as you can find. To publicize the advantages of the Triad fibers used in its automotive air filters, the Fram unit of Honeywell is handing out packages of deep red ''A Taste of Triad'' pasta.</p>
        <p>Labeled in Fram's signature orange-and-black style, the ''100% edible'' noodles are ''a fun way to see what a difference shape can make,'' according to the package. The pasta's unusual cross-section -- a bit like a Star Wars TIE fighter with an extra wing -- is said to hold a lot more sauce than plain old spaghetti. Demonstrating the principle in the kitchen is meant to help retailers and sales representatives remember the company's assertion that similarly shaped and colored fibers in the new air filter hold 48 percent more dirt than ordinary fibers.</p>

        <p>Labeled in Fram's signature orange-and-black style, the ''100% edible'' noodles are ''a fun way to see what a difference shape can make,'' according to the package. The pasta's unusual cross-section -- a bit like a Star Wars TIE fighter with an extra wing -- is said to hold a lot more sauce than plain old spaghetti. Demonstrating the principle in the kitchen is meant to help retailers and sales representatives remember the company's assertion that similarly shaped and colored fibers in the new air filter hold 48 percent more dirt than ordinary fibers.</p>
        <p>According to Heather Gillette, a spokeswoman for Fram, a packaging designer at the company first suggested the metaphoric macaroni. Marketing executives turned up an artisan pasta maker in Rhode Island who could manufacture it in the unusual shape; the correct red food coloring had to be imported from Italy.</p>
        <p>All the effort paid off in the attention the new Fram filter garnered at the latest Automotive Aftermarket Industry Week trade show. ''The pasta was a big hit,'' Ms. Gillette said.</p>
