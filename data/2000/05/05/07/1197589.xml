        <p>STEVEN KANE thought he had concocted the perfect advertising medium.</p>
        <p>First, in 1996, he created an Internet site called Gamesville.com that let visitors distract themselves with bingo, card games and quizzes -- typically for cash prizes.</p>
        <p>The contestants would willingly enter their names and addresses, because otherwise how could Gamesville mail them their prize checks? The advertising on the site, in turn, would be customized to each user, based on all sorts of facts that Gamesville could gather with that address from credit bureaus and mailing-list houses.</p>
        <p>And all of this could hardly offend, Mr. Kane figured, because he told users what he was doing. ''Our privacy policy was simple,'' he said. ''Abandon all privacy ye who enter here.''</p>
        <p>The plan worked. Gamesville has attracted more than four million visitors who entered their addresses -- information that turned out to be the key to all sorts of other data, not just the usual lists of magazine subscriptions and auto registrations.</p>
        <p>''I can find out whether you are a person who lives on the edge of your credit limit or pays your bills,'' he said, ''whether you are a mountain guy or a beach guy.''</p>
        <p>There was only one problem: advertisers didn't much care. Most just wanted to reach as large an audience as possible. Some used the most basic pieces of data that Mr. Kane collected, aiming their messages, say, at women or college students or people in the regions where the advertisers have stores. But Mr. Kane's effort to find debt-laden beach bums or Volvo owners who read Guns and Ammo was to no avail.</p>
        <p>And that is the unspoken but enlightening secret about corporate America's attempt to get even more personal with its customers. For all the discussion about how the Internet is stripping consumers of whatever thin veil of privacy they have left in this world of credit bureaus and supermarket scanners, analysts have failed to recognize  just how ineffective most of these data-gathering systems have been. Sure, many companies are trying to peer back through the glowing screens at Internet users, but so far no one has been able to make a big business out of being Big Brother.</p>
        <p>Many ad-driven Web sites, from Gamesville to giants like Yahoo, have hoped that their clients will be willing to pay a premium for the ability to aim ads at specific groups of users who, presumably, will be more likely to buy their products. And database systems have been promoted even more heavily by advertising networks, like DoubleClick and Engage, that increasingly act as middlemen between sites and advertisers, inserting ads into Web pages.</p>
        <p>The few advertisers that have tried these systems have not yet given up on them. But most say the response to their ads does not go up enough to be worth the extra cost and bother. It seems easier for them to buy cheap shotguns, in effect, than expensive laser-guided rifles.</p>
        <p>''I have been overwhelmed by how underwhelmed I have been on people's ability to deliver on the promise of targeting,'' said Dan Springer, director of marketing of NextCard, a credit card company that is one of the Web's biggest advertisers.</p>
        <p>Some data marketing systems have already been abandoned -- though that doesn't mean that privacy-rights advocates should be retiring to count their successes. Many proponents of database marketing say they are building new systems to overcome their temporary setbacks, with more ways to collect and link data about users.</p>
        <p>''Data is the holy grail,'' said Anil Singh, the senior vice president for sales at Yahoo, which has based much of its business strategy around database marketing. Yahoo's problem is that while it can command high prices for advertising on some parts of its site, like its stock quotation page and computer shopping area, advertisers are willing only to pay much lower rates for others, like e-mail and weather pages.</p>
        <p>So Yahoo's goal is to be able to track users so that advertisers can find the ones they are looking for, whatever page they are on. If it can identify those users who frequent the stock-quotation pages, for example, Yahoo hopes to charge brokerage firms high rates to reach them, even while they are checking the weather.</p>
        <p>Mr. Singh says such data-based targeting is essential.</p>
        <p>''If you don't use data, you wind up with a bunch of excess inventory,'' Mr. Singh said.</p>
        <p>But many advertisers, and even some operators of big Internet sites, find that they do not need to look in keyholes to figure out their best prospects. That is because the sites that people go to -- and the searches they conduct -- tend to reflect their interests better than even the most elaborate mailing lists developed in the pre-Internet era.</p>
        <p>''We don't need to track people,'' said Robert W. Pittman, president of America Online, which has disavowed the database marketing techniques that are being offered to advertisers by other big Internet sites. ''If you want to sell cars, you talk to people when they are in the car area.''</p>
        <p>A Jigsaw Puzzle With Missing Pieces</p>
        <p>The failure, to date, of Web-based data-gathering systems is not for lack of trying by Web sites and ad networks, which have worked to gather and correlate information about computer users from a wide range of sources.</p>
        <p>Sites can glean a few facts about users from the Internet itself -- mainly, what type of computer and browser a user has and through what network it is connected to the Internet. That lets advertisers aim at corporate users in certain industries, say, or sometimes at home users in certain cities.</p>
        <p>They can also follow surfing habits, keeping track of Web pages that a user visits in order to infer his interests. Some also try to use this information to predict users' demographic characteristics.</p>
        <p>A site may gather personal information online by asking users to register and fill out surveys, as is required by The New York Times on the Web. Or a site may accumulate such data slowly, grabbing a ZIP code, for example, when a user checks the weather, or a birthday when he checks his horoscope. Many sites offer sweepstakes to get users to enter their addresses and other information.</p>
        <p>Personal information is also obtained off line. Once a site collects a user's name and address, it can buy  other information about him or her from mailing-list companies or, if it already has a database, it can examine its own customer files.</p>
        <p>Much of this data-gathering relies on a technology that places small files, known as cookies, on the hard drive of an Internet user; these generally contain an identifying number. Cookies allow sites to record each page a user sees and to show each user different advertisements based on information in their files.</p>
        <p>With all these techniques, it would seem that Web sites could collect vast dossiers on users. In fact, much of the available information is crude, fragmentary and filled with errors.</p>
        <p>For example, though the network address can often pinpoint a user's location, the 20 million users of America Online all show up as living in Dulles, Va., where the company has its headquarters. Moreover, most systems cannot figure out all the sites visited by a user. Yahoo knows where users go on its own site but knows nothing about where they go on other sites. Working with such a fragmentary file is something like having only 50 pieces of a 500-piece jigsaw puzzle.</p>
        <p>An ad network gets a broader view by inserting ads into Web pages on a wide range of sites and by using a cookie to record which sites are visited. But this method, too, provides information on only a portion of the pages viewed by a user.</p>
        <p>DoubleClick, in fact, decided that its information on users' surfing habits was so meaningless, at least for now, that it does not even offer it to advertisers. (The company has become the lightning rod for concerns over privacy issues, but the criticism relates to its future plans to use data about people's mail-order purchases, not its current practices.)</p>
        <p>MatchLogic, an ad network now owned by Excite@Home, has collected personal information on 20 million users through a multiplicity of techniques. Using banner ads on various sites, MatchLogic runs contests to lure users into identifying themselves. It also gains access to information when people register at and use the Excite Web portal, and from other sites that agree to share user identities.</p>
        <p>For these Web users, the company can customize advertising based on their answers to questions. Moreover, it tries to use this hard data to draw better inferences about 52 million other users on whose computers it has placed cookies, examining their surfing habits to reach conclusions about their interests and demographic characteristics, even though it does not know their names.</p>
        <p>''We are looking for signals and patterns in the data to figure out whether you are male or female rich or poor, married or single,'' said Mitchell Bennett, MatchLogic's vice president for sales. But, he acknowledged, ''It's an art, not a science.''</p>
        <p>Matchlogic officials say that for now, use of its targeting systems is small -- but that it is growing as advertisers learn how to use them.</p>
        <p>''We get more mind-share from clients than spending,'' said Martin Smith, MatchLogic's director of enterprise solutions. ''The clients say we have to prove we are faster, better and cheaper for them to use us. We will. This is like television in 1950.''</p>
        <p>Engage, an ad network that is partly owned by CMGI, is also trying to deduce information about users by tracking where they surf. It hopes to get a comprehensive picture of users' interests by getting a big network of sites to feed the topics of all the pages a user visits into a central database. In return for providing the information, the sites have access to  profiles of individual users' interests; that, in turn, can be used to help determine which ads to show.</p>
        <p>To get sites and users to cooperate, Engage promises that it will not collect personally identifiable information like names or addresses. The interest profile is simply associated with a cookie on a computer's hard drive.</p>
        <p>The company has 52 million profiles, with information from 3,000 sites. Nonetheless, it has had trouble attracting either advertisers or many of the most visited sites -- so much so, in fact, that it has changed its strategy to also offer other, more general advertising services.</p>
        <p>Still, the company says its data system will eventually prove successful. ''We think the original premise is absolutely 100 percent on the money,'' said Paul L. Schaut, Engage's chief executive. ''Your past online behavior is the best predictor of your future online behavior.''</p>
        <p>A Meager Reward From Focused Ads</p>
        <p>Web sites and ad networks say advertisers have just been too harried to learn how to use the database tools. But many advertisers that  have tried them find the results modest at best.</p>
        <p>''A lot of this stuff is the tail wagging the dog,'' said Al Noyes, executive vice president for sales and marketing at SmarterKids.com, an online seller of educational toys that has tried various ad networks that promise to search out mothers of young children. ''Maybe you can increase your returns by 10 or 15 percent, but it's not worth it for such a small increase to the bottom line.''</p>
        <p>Web sites and ad networks see targeted ads as their premium product, so they charge advertisers the full rate-card price -- typically $20 to $80 per thousand times an ad is shown.</p>
        <p>But because of the glut of available Web pages, site owners often sell general advertising at heavy discounts, with prices well under $5 a thousand available to advertisers who bargain well.</p>
        <p>''We found it much more effective to buy cheap media than to pay more money to buy targeted ads,'' said Mr. Springer of NextCard.</p>
        <p>Some Web sites are themselves beginning to question whether they come out ahead by charging a higher price for a smaller number of ads. Many are concluding that they can make more money selling a lot of broader ads.</p>
        <p>''As a media company, you want to sell your entire base,'' said Charles Ardai, chief executive of Juno Online Services, an e-mail and Internet service company that initially hoped to sell focused advertising based on responses of its users to a questionnaire. ''You don't want to sell an infinitely large number of infinitely small segments. It's not a good use of our sales force.''</p>
        <p>These disappointments do not come as a surprise to veterans of the mail-order world, who have long used customer data and found that database marketing has hardly been the panacea that was predicted 15 years ago.</p>
        <p>To be sure, some pieces of data -- particularly information about a customer's behavior -- have been enormously useful to certain industries.  Credit card companies, for example,  found that people who borrow a lot of money but pay it back are their best customers. And direct-order merchants found that the best predictor of whether someone would buy from a given catalog was whether he had recently bought something -- anything -- by mail.</p>
        <p>But there are hundreds of other  variables that are seemingly just as logical but do not work as well, like ZIP codes or magazine subscriptions.</p>
        <p>The effects of even the most advanced data analysis techniques are not huge. In the direct-mail area, such techniques have allowed the most sophisticated users of data to increase their response rates by only tenths of a percentage point.</p>
        <p>Of course, such gains can be important; a company that spends $2 or $3 to mail a catalog has a lot of incentive to send it only to people who are likely to respond. But because Internet marketing is neither as expensive nor as precise, such fine-tuning has less impact.</p>
        <p>More fundamentally, the often-quoted idea that that technology lets companies market their products with a different message for each consumer turns out to be hardly more practical than sending a sales representative to every person's home.</p>
        <p>''A lot of technology people with no direct marketing backgrounds assumed that since the Internet allows you literally to have one-to-one marketing, then that must be the holy grail,'' said George Garrick, the former chief executive of Information Resources, a big marketing data company, who later started and then sold Flycast, an Internet advertising company. ''But they just don't understand the law of diminishing returns. The more and more finely you segment an audience, the less the increase in your return on investment.''</p>
        <p>Database Compilers Refine Their Tools</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, efforts to develop even more elaborate database marketing systems are continuing. Some ad networks have started to link their cookie files to those of their clients, so that a company's existing customers see different ads as they surf the Web than new sales prospects do.</p>
        <p>For example, another advertising network, 24/7 Media, is creating an ad for an online stock brokerage firm that will show the brokerage's customers up-to-the-minute quotations on the three largest holdings in their portfolios. The idea, naturally, is to prompt them to trade. Others will see a promotion encouraging them to open an account.</p>
        <p>The biggest effort by the ad networks is to move beyond data about where people surf to customizing ads on the basis of what people buy.</p>
        <p>That is the theory behind DoubleClick's recent acquisition of Abacus Direct, which runs a consortium through which catalog companies share information about the purchasing habits of their customers.</p>
        <p>DoubleClick wants to learn the names and addresses of as many Internet users as possible, by running contests and by having the information referred from other sites that learn the identities of users. This data, in turn, will let the company look up purchase habits in the Abacus database and in a new consortium of online merchants that DoubleClick is putting together.</p>
        <p>''Transactions are the best predictor,'' said Kevin O'Connor, chief executive of DoubleClick. ''If you buy a computer, you are more likely to buy other computer products.'' (Doubleclick's plan is on hold, however, until it works through the privacy concerns.)</p>
        <p>Others argue that the problem with database marketing on the Web is not the data but rather the ineffectiveness of advertising on Internet pages, especially with narrow banner ads. Indeed, many advertisers are finding surprisingly good results by using companies that have assembled lists of people who have agreed to receive advertising by e-mail. Most ad networks have started or have bought e-mail programs.</p>
        <p>Some companies say the real value of data will be realized after a customer goes to the site of an online store or advertiser. Amazon.Com, for example, has long used its records of customers' past purchases to recommend other items that they may like. Similarly, Fingerhut, a subsidiary of Federated Department Stores that has opened an online retail operation, is trying to identify all the Web surfers who have bought from its many catalogs; the information will help it customize its home page to feature items that they are most likely to buy.</p>
        <p>Angara E-Commerce Services, a software vendor, is using many of the techniques of the ad networks to gather data about Web users. But it will feed that information to Web sites so that they can be personalized, even for people who visit them for the first time. Its first client, Greatcoffee.com, features one of four different coffees, depending on where the user lives.</p>
        <p>In a variation on banner ads, some companies have found ways to get users to accept superimposed ads on the pages they are viewing. Companies that offer free Internet service have such ads, as does a company called Dash, which offers shopping discounts. The technology allows them to record all the sites that their users visit; Dash even plans to read all the pages to record what its users are buying.</p>
        <p>Though advertisers have not been very interested in such data so far, the ability to float an ad for one company directly over the site of a competitor has been very popular.</p>
        <p>''What better place for BMW to advertise than when someone is on Mercedes' site?'' said Daniel Kaufman, the chief executive of Dash.</p>
        <p>The devotees of database marketing remain insistently loyal to their work in progress. Mr. Kane, for one, figures that eventually someone will get it right.</p>
        <p>Despite the lack of interest by advertisers in its more sophisticated targeting systems, Gamesville was one of the few Internet companies to make a profit; it was sold to Lycos for $232 million in December.</p>
        <p>''Gamesville.com barely crawled out of the primordial ooze onto the beach,'' Mr. Kane said last month, shortly before leaving the company.  ''And our clients still have one fin and two cells. But we will evolve.''</p>
        <p>A Foot in the Door of Your E-Mailbox</p>
        <p>CALL it Son of Spam.</p>
        <p>Electronic reincarnations of junk mail are the hottest corner of Internet marketing, proving to be an effective tool of persuasion, a way to use data about customers and, in some surprising ways, a way to collect data about them, too.</p>
        <p>An e-mail message, after all, gives an advertiser more room to stretch out and promote its product than a narrow banner ad on a Web site. The latest e-mail formats even allow pictures and graphics. The trick, of course, is getting consumers to welcome the pitches, because unsolicited e-mail -- called spam -- is considered an Internet faux pas.</p>
        <p>Several companies try to have consumers ''opt in'' to commercial e-mail, either in conjunction with sites that ask users to register (like The New York Times on the Web), or by offering cash or rewards, or by promising information on topics of interest. Because people must enter some information when they agree to get the mail -- generally at least age, sex and ZIP code -- mail can be sent to people with specific profiles.</p>
        <p>Lifeminders.com, in Herndon, Va., combines helpful hints with advertising in a series of e-mail newsletters  and finds ways to get consumers to reveal even more information about themselves. For example, its family life newsletter periodically offers a feature that calculates how much readers should save for their children's college education. The real motive is to find out the ages of the users' children.</p>
        <p>''If you haven't told me something when you register, I'll find a way to find out,'' said Stephen Chapin Jr., the founder and chief executive of Lifeminders. The problem with other Internet database marketing systems, he argued, is that the information they gather has not been specific enough to be relevant. ''If I know the breed of your cat or dog,'' he said, ''I can get a 25 percent better response rate.''</p>
