        <p>The county's new commissioner of emergency services, Patrick T. Kelly, has rejected a labor leader's call to consider replacing volunteer firefighters throughout the county with paid firefighters. ''The concept that a volunteer fire department provides adequate fire and emergency protection is the biggest illusion since Houdini,'' Anthony Pagano, president of the Yonkers Professional Firefighters Union, said in a statement last week, two days after Mr. Kelly's appointment. On Wednesday, Mr. Kelly -- a former division chief of the Baltimore County Fire Department in Maryland -- replied, saying: ''My job is not to determine whether paid fire service is better than volunteer service. My job is to work within the system that's here and make it operate the best it can.''</p>
