        <p>The rise of the Kenyans and other Africans is often cited as the main reason why an American man has not won the New York City Marathon since 1982 and the Boston Marathon since 1983 or been close to an Olympic medal since Frank Shorter's gold in 1972 and silver in 1976. After all, it is said, Africans typically run many miles to school and have the advantage of a running-rich, high-altitude environment.

        <p>Even though the new United States citizen Khalid Khannouchi is sitting out today's men's Olympic marathon trial in Pittsburgh, his status as a ''ready-made'' star who is far superior to other Americans emphasizes an irony that contradicts most explanations on the demise of American distance runners.</p>
        <p>The rise of the Kenyans and other Africans is often cited as the main reason why an American man has not won the New York City Marathon since 1982 and the Boston Marathon since 1983 or been close to an Olympic medal since Frank Shorter's gold in 1972 and silver in 1976. After all, it is said, Africans typically run many miles to school and have the advantage of a running-rich, high-altitude environment. In Kenya, there are no other big-time sports to attract athletic talent; if you're a good athlete, you run.</p>
        <p>But the root of the American problem is not based on training environment or physical strength. The problem stems from the mind. We're psyched out.</p>
        <p>When Khannouchi, 28, came to the United States from Morocco in 1993, he was not a running sensation. In high school, he had run 3,000 meters in 8 minutes 35 seconds, which would not have won the high school event at last week's Penn Relays. The record for United States high school boys is 8:05.8. But Khannouchi believed he could be a great runner and focused solely on that mission. He got a job as a dishwasher and trained at night.</p>
        <p>Even without a coach or formal training doctrine behind him, Khannouchi knew that distance-running success took years to achieve. Winning a marathon would not be a slam dunk. You had to be patient. You had to sacrifice. Eventually, your time would come.</p>
        <p>Khannouchi waited. As recently as March 1996, he was still the kind of also-ran who would place ninth in the 3,000 meters at the United States national indoor meet. He had no sponsor and made a few bucks here and there off the racing circuit. He thought about quitting.</p>
        <p>Finally, after four years of running while dodging Brooklyn traffic, Khannouchi made a breakthrough in 1997. After Khannouchi won the Chicago Marathon that fall in 2 hours 7 minutes 10 seconds (his world record, set last year at Chicago, is 2:05:42), I visited him at his home in Wyckoff Heights on the Brooklyn-Queens border. Then, he lived in a third-floor walkup and did speed work at Victory Field, on a scrubby track barely adequate for the joggers who circled it wearing headphones.</p>
        <p>All along, Khannouchi never conceded anything to the Kenyans or anyone else. He ran nose-to-nose with the Kenyans and eventually defeated them. If anything, some of the Kenyans feared Khannouchi. They would whisper about him in awe when he turned up at races.</p>
        <p>Once, Kenyans respected American runners like Steve Prefontaine, Alberto Salazar and Craig Virgin. Recently, I spoke with Virgin, the only American man to win the world cross-country title, an event now dominated by Kenyans. Virgin, who grew up on a farm in Illinois, said he never doubted he could beat anybody in the world.</p>
        <p>For years, however, American runners, predominately white, have sulked with a sense of inferiority, thinking the Kenyans have the edge and there's nothing to be done about it. Americans have despaired so deeply that they race almost exclusively among themselves and avoid Kenyans and other foreign opposition at all cost.</p>
        <p>The telling statistic is not only that in the last 10 years only three American men have made the top 10 at the New York City Marathon. It's also that leading Americans no longer run races like New York or Boston at all.</p>
        <p>Apparently, the Americans' poor self-image has had a disturbing trickle-down effect that could have drastic repercussions on many levels. Last week, at a high school track meet in New Jersey, I saw an example of that. I overheard a white youngster entered in the mile telling a teammate his prospects for victory were not good. Referring to an opponent who was new to him, he said to his friend: ''See that black guy over there? He's in the mile. I'm going to get blown away.''</p>
        <p>As it turned out, the African-American youngster, an inexperienced freshman, rushed out too fast in the lead and faded. The other kid actually won.</p>
