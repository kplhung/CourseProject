        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>Overheard while standing in line for tickets to ''Fantasia'' at the IMAX Theater in Palisades Center.</p>
        <p>Man: ''Your mom says you've been acting up. I want you to listen harder to what she says. Trust me, she's a wonderful woman.''</p>

        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>Overheard while standing in line for tickets to ''Fantasia'' at the IMAX Theater in Palisades Center.</p>
        <p>Man: ''Your mom says you've been acting up. I want you to listen harder to what she says. Trust me, she's a wonderful woman.''</p>
        <p>Child: ''If she's so wonderful, why did you divorce her?''</p>
        <p>AUDREY CORN</p>
        <p>Now that spring is here and the influenza outbreaks are officially over, I recall a time when catching the flu had its good points. Back then it was known as the grippe, and along with the scratchy throat and aches and pains came a guilt-free chance to be pampered and plied with chicken soup and sleep, read and watch TV.</p>
        <p>It's different now. I don't get the flu anymore, I get a flu shot. I take echincea and suck on zinc lozenges. I met a friend the other day while in line at the Fresh Fields in Montclair, and the conversation went like this:</p>
        <p>Me: ''How are you?''</p>
        <p>Friend: ''I could be worse.''</p>
        <p>Me: That's good.''</p>
        <p>Friend: ''No, that's bad.''</p>
        <p>Me: ''How so?''</p>
        <p>Friend: ''I didn't miss a day of work all winter. I'm way behind in my reading and I'm tired of taping my daytime soaps. The only bug around is in my computer. I feel unloved and uncared-for.''</p>
        <p>Me: ''But you haven't been sick all year. Why are you so depressed?''</p>
        <p>Friend: ''I'm flu-less.''</p>
        <p>Me: ''Oh, get a grip.''</p>
        <p>MARILYN COHEN VASSEN</p>
        <p>KENTUCKY DERBY</p>
        <p>Kentucky. The Derby. They're off at the gun --</p>
        <p>And two minutes later some thoroughbred's won.</p>
        <p>(If the NBA ran it, I haven't a doubt</p>
        <p>After each quarter mile they would call a timeout.</p>
        <p>BOB McKENTY</p>
        <p>Stick this in the category of ''the things neighbors do.''</p>
        <p>What's worse than the guy next to you on the commute home talking loudly on his cell phone just about the time you are dozing off?</p>
        <p>Well, one woman asked, how about a neighbor standing in the middle of his yard at 11:30 on a weeknight talking so loudly on his cordless phone that you thought the conversation was taking place in your bedroom, where you had been sleeping?</p>
        <p>Got you beat, a colleague offered.</p>
        <p>''During one of the few snowstorms last winter I was awakened by the roar of my neighbor's snow blower, which he had equipped with a headlight,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Is that touche or mush?</p>
        <p>DIVERSIFICATION</p>
        <p>I open the bill from my gasoline vendor</p>
        <p>And out pops a colorful, glossy brochure</p>
        <p>Describing a short-wave receiver, a blender,</p>
        <p>Indispensable dryer for mother's coiffure,</p>
        <p>Silverware, earthenware, quaint copper pots,</p>
        <p>Luxurious luggage for going first class.</p>
        <p>Twelve easy payments. Just sign on the dots.</p>
        <p>Are they kidding?! I can't even pay for the gas.</p>
