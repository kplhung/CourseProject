        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Richard B. Woodward raises some interesting points in his article ''On Artificial Rarity and Fakery'' [April 23]. When an important photograph or other work of art is purchased, we must be prepared to admit that most of its market value is derived not from the visible work but from its invisible associations. The main sources of value lie in the work's age, its rarity, its historic connections and, generally speaking, its significance not as art but as a cultural artifact.</p>
        <p>The concept of fakery plays havoc with those associations. There is no reason a copy or fake may not be as good as or even better than the original. The Chinese have known this for centuries.</p>

        <p>Every purchaser of art, whether curator, collector or member of the general public, must ask himself to what extent these issues of authenticity are important, and whether these invisible associations are worth their astronomic price, or whether the art market represents a modern-day tulipomania.</p>
