        <p>HE was born to a world of yacht clubs, privilege and family tragedy. And after being lost in years of substance abuse, he finally evolved into a master of his craft.</p>
        <p>Being a master carpenter who restores and builds wooden boats in New Jersey makes Alan Hedges as rare as a hen's tooth in an industry that largely faded in the 1960's with the introduction of low-maintenance glass-fiber production boats.</p>
        <p>''Now that there a resurgence in the building of small wooden crafts in Jersey has started over the past eight years, there are very few actual craftsmen left to do the work,'' said Mike O'Brien, senior editor of Wooden Boat magazine in Portland, Me., who grew up in Linden and spent his summers sailing off Long Beach Island.</p>
        <p>''Maine and Washington State are where all the craftsmen went,'' he said, ''but there are always traditionalists who want the warmth of wood and they are bringing the craft back to New Jersey.''</p>
        <p>Lee Cherubini, the owner of the 54-year-old wooden boat company, Cherubini Boats Inc. in Delran, said Mr. Hedges -- who worked as head carpenter for Cherubini Boats from 1980 to 1985 before opening a shop in Greenwich -- had been a ''torch carrier'' for his craft.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Hedges, 50, does contract work for Cherubini, making everything from cabinets to hatches for the company's 45-foot wooden sailboats.</p>
        <p>''You could count on one hand the craftsmen in this state doing what Alan Hedges does,'' Mr. Cherubini said. ''Nobody else in this state can match his level of craftsmanship.''</p>
        <p>He said Mr. Hedges was ''awesome,'' adding, ''Sure, you can find cabinet makers to do fine hardwood cabinets for your kitchen, but can they do that kind of work for your boat?''</p>
        <p>All the curves in a boat's interior make the creation of cabinetry, doors and other amenties much harder than anyone imagined, Mr. Cherubini said. ''It's an art,'' he said, ''and Alan is an artist.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps in a world where so much value is placed on such intangibles as e-commerce and telecommuting, woodworking may seem insignificant. But then it does pay about $50 an hour or more for most of those who have remained in this vanishing trade.</p>
        <p>For his part, Mr. Hedges charges less than $30 an hour. He says he is in it for the solace, not the money.</p>
        <p>In a world where faster, better and more are all the rage, Mr. Hedges, his wife, Ann, and a mutt named Charlene live a simple life at the southern edge of the state in a mall town that looks like Mayberry 2000.</p>
        <p>To find his wood shop, where he restores fading wooden boats and builds small sailboats, one must make a pilgrimage through a side of the state most do not know exists. Mr. Hedges chose a town populated with  homes from the 1800's where the sprawl is a bay away, the perfect haven for a craftsman who labors with chisel and saw in the shadow of technology.</p>
        <p>Greenwich -- with its rolling emerald pastures, horses, sheep and oyster boats along the Delaware Bay -- is nestled in the shadow of the Salem Nuclear Power Plant.</p>
        <p>''I like being near the water,'' Mr. Hedges said. ''I grew up around boats, raced E-scows and have crewed on race boats a few times, but mostly I like making them more than being on them.''</p>
        <p>Outside his shop is an eclectic mix of old wooden power boats he has been given by passersby in the hopes that he will someday bring them back to life.</p>
        <p>''People from all over just seem to find me,'' he said. ''I am the A.S.P.C.A. for wooden boats around here.''</p>
        <p>Lean, tan, calloused and of humble income, he is a long chalk from the stock he came from. His father, Robert, was an orthodontist in Jenkintown, Pa., a tony suburb of Philadelphia, and his mother, Elizabeth, was a housewife. His only brother, Roger, 55, works for a marine finance company in Atlanta.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. O'Brien, Mr. Hedges spent his summers on Long Beach Island and became a member of the Little Egg Harbor Yacht Club, setting sail the day he took his first lesson on Barnegat Bay at age 8.</p>
        <p>''That's what people did,'' Mr. Hedges said with a mild shrug as he brushed the sawdust from his hands after working in the cinder block wood shop he works in by himself.</p>
        <p>His mother died when he was 19 when she fell alseep in bed smoking a cigarette. His father died of heart failure in 1995.</p>
        <p>''Let's just pass lightly over the death of my mother, O.K.?'' Mr. Hedges asks. ''Let's say after that I spent a lot of time in and out of colleges majoring in substance abuse. I didn't do the hard stuff; marijuana and beer -- it was the 60's. I considered it recreational more than something you would go into rehab over.''</p>
        <p>At 22, after drifting through the late 60's and early 70's going from Syracuse to Temple and on to Philadelphia Community College without ever choosing a major, he had his father at wit's end.</p>
        <p>''It was hard on my father,'' he said. ''I think I knew from the outset that I didn't want to go to college. That's what was expected of me. I was going to be an educated person. I knew for sure I didn't want to be an orthodontist.''</p>
        <p>So Mr. Hedges, who had spent some time apprenticing to carpenters in high school, turned to working with his hands so that his mind could be absorbed by his work rather than books or brooding. When an opportunity in the 1970's to apprentice to a renowned Philadelphia boat builder, John Wright Jr.,  Mr. Hedges found his love of the water and of wood to be compatible and therapeutic.</p>
        <p>''I guess if you've never done this sort of manual labor it's hard to understand,'' he said. ''But when you are making something, all your mind and energy are there in the piece. You just put yourself into it and the days go by, and in the end you have something to show for it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hedges has plenty to show for his hours of toil, most of it skimming the waters off New Jersey in the form of gleaming Chris Craft power boats brought back from weather-beaten old hulks.</p>
        <p>He also subcontracts for Cherubini, which  produces some of the state's sleek 40- to 50-foot wooden sailing vessels. Mr. Hedges does the hatches, rails, teak work and interior cabinetry for Cherubini.</p>
        <p>Choosing a career path was bittersweet news to his father. ''Initially, he didn't handle it well, until he realized I was going to stick with it,'' he said. ''Then he settled into it.''</p>
        <p>His own boat, a 30-foot wooden sloop, Runa No. 7, was built in Denmark in 1946. Her sister ship, Runa No. 1, is berthed in the Danish Museum of Yachting. He has no grand plans to circumnavigate, only to get the boat back into sailing grace, which she has been in and out of over the past 17 years that Mr. Hedges has owned her.</p>
        <p>''It's a labor of love,'' he said as he patted the hull. ''I don't really have the time or attention span it takes to live aboard or sail long distances. I did a Maine to Bermuda race on someone's boat a few years back and I couldn't wait to get back on land.''</p>
        <p>Asked his ideal business, Mr. Hedges takes on an anticipatory grin and then says: ''If I could do anything in the world? Build any boat I want. I would build nothing but Hershoff 12-footers. That would be a dream. Someone else could sail her. I'd just like nothing better than to take that project on.''</p>
