        <p>Don't come to Singapore expecting a laconic equatorial city. Despite blazing heat and humidity year round, Singapore is a digital-age metropolis determined to make its name as a world capital.</p>
        <p>Like the pink bougainvilleas that sprout from every highway planter and the stately angsana trees lining the roads, nothing here is serendipitous, least of all the approach to tourism. As part of what the government calls Tourism 21, Singapore is trying to become a must-see destination, as well as a hub for travelers bound elsewhere in Southeast Asia.</p>
        <p>Delightfully green, safe and efficient, Singapore is a welcome refuge from its more exotic, bewildering neighbors and an impressive tribute to urban planning and immigrant pluck. The city is undergoing a renaissance, from confident new architecture like Kenzo Tange's UE Square near Fort Canning Park, to meticulously restored historic districts, with avant-garde clubs, quaint cafes and hip restaurants. Shopping is a perennial Singapore pastime, but June brings a cultural spectacle: the Singapore Arts Festival.</p>
        <p>The way to appreciate Singapore is to go behind its squeaky clean facade to find its cultural and historical kaleidoscope. Singapore is a melting pot of Malays, Indians and an array of Chinese groups with their own languages, among them Hokkien, Teochew and Cantonese.</p>
        <p>Events</p>
        <p>Performers from all over the world will gather in June for the Singapore Arts Festival, June 1 to 25. Performances are scattered around the city, so for information, call (65) 837-9589, or see artsfest.nac  .gov.sg on the Web; for tickets, call Sistic, (65) 348-5555. The festival opens outdoors atop a wooded hill in Fort Canning Park at 7 p.m. on June 1 to 4 with dances from Yunnan Province in China and Uttar Pradesh in India, as well as Vietnamese folk opera, Cambodian chants and South African Zulu rhythms. Tickets are about $8.80, at 1.70 Singapore dollars to the American dollar.</p>
        <p>At 8 p.m. on June 3 and 4, Hong Kong's Contemporary Dance Company will perform ''Sexing Three Millennia,'' about concubines in China, at the Kallang Theater, near the National Stadium; $13 to $30.50.</p>
        <p>The Abbey Theater of Ireland will present Hugh Leonard's ''Love in the Title,'' about three generations of women. Shows start at 8 p.m. June 7 and 8 at the Victoria Theater, behind the Raffles Hotel; $13 to $30.50.</p>
        <p>For choral music enthusiasts, the Tallis Scholars from Britain will preform renditions of medieval English music June 3 at 8 p.m. in Chijmes Hall, a converted Catholic convent chapel at 30 Victoria Street, next to Raffles City. The Scholars switch to Italian Renaissance songs June 4 at 8 p.m. at Victoria Concert Hall, next to Victoria Theater. Tickets for each concert are $13 to $36.50.</p>
        <p>A different kind of cultural event is the Singapore International Dragon Boat Festival, June 3 and 4 in Marina Bay. Twenty-four man crews from 12 countries will race 750 meters for $18,000 in prize money. A good viewing spot is the Marina Promenade on Raffles Avenue.</p>
        <p>Through October, the Singapore Art Museum, in a beautifully restored former Catholic boys school, is showing ''Imaging the Century,'' an exhibition of paintings tracing Southeast Asia's history -- colonial rule, war and revolution, independence and social change. The museum is at 71 Bras Basah Road, and is open 9 a.m. to 5:30 p.m., until 9 p.m. Wednesday; closed Monday. Admission, $1.75.</p>
        <p>Sightseeing</p>
        <p>Singapore is not dotted with historic temples and monuments as other Asian cities are. But it does have several interesting neighborhoods worth exploring on foot. Go early or late enough to avoid the oppressive midday heat.</p>
        <p>A good place to start is the Merlion, a water-spouting statue of a mythical lionheaded fish. While unspectacular as fountains go, it offers picturesque views near where legend says Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles landed in 1819 to establish Singapore as a British trading port and lend his name to a hotel, a school and a shopping mall, among other places. The Merlion park is open daily 7 a.m. to 10 p.m.</p>
        <p>South of the river, away from the high-rise hotels, lies Raffles Place and the heart of the financial district. On Cecil Street, the Stock Exchange sits where there once was a thriving spice market. Just off Telok Ayer Street, Pekin Street has been turned into a pleasant pedestrian promenade leading to Far East Square with a row of newly restored two- and three-story shophouses, built by Chinese immigrants to house their families above their businesses.</p>
        <p>Farther up Telok Ayer is the intricately decorated Thian Hock Keng temple, built in 1840 along what until roughly 1930 was shoreline to honor the queen of heaven and protector of sailors. West of Telok Ayer, on Amoy and Club Streets, are some of the best examples of restored shophouses. This gentrified area's older establishments, like the Dried Goods Guild, now rub elbows with a trendy assortment of bars, restaurants and dot-com companies.</p>
        <p>To the southwest, on the corner of Maxwell Road and Kadayanallur Street is the modern edifice of Singapore's Urban Redevelopment Authority. On the second floor, you can see a scale model of the city and the government's vision for it, including a pharaonic new downtown of skyscrapers dwarfing the present skyline and what appears to be a gigantic bowling pin over the city's designated entertainment district around Bugis Junction.</p>
        <p>Also worth wandering through is Little India, a cluster of shops around Serangoon Road, north of the Colonial district, selling saris, bindis for women's foreheads and booming bhangra CD's. On Sunday evenings, this boisterous area is inundated with laborers from India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Visitors may join them at the Veerama Kaliamman Temple and pay their respects to Kali.</p>
        <p>East of the Rochor Canal, the perfume shops and textile merchants around Arab Street remain picturesque, although business is waning, and Sultan Mosque endures as a serene refuge for the faithful. Stop along North Bridge Road for a murtabak pancake filled with egg and chicken or mutton. Meander down Kandahar Street to find the the dilapidated 160-year-old palace of Singapore's former Malay sultanate, whose descendants were evicted only last year.</p>
        <p>Singapore's zoo is one of the few in Asia to keep animals in natural looking surroundings rather than in cages. Once the sun sets, the zoo offers a Night Safari, with nocturnal animals up and about. The leopards are mesmerizing, but the hands-down highlight is the bat enclosure, which you can enter to test your composure against cat-sized fruit bats inspecting your coiffure. Admission to the zoo, which is open 8:30 a.m. to 6 p.m., is $6. The Night Safari, 7:30 p.m. to midnight, costs $9.</p>
        <p>Singapore's aquarium, Underwater World, is south of the city on Sentosa Island, which is a little bigger than Central Park and has man-made beaches, golf courses and other attractions. In addition to tidal pools with touchable sea life and a moving sidewalk that takes visitors through tanks of sea life, the aquarium has a new dolphin pool and a shark tank where scuba divers can take a 30-minute guided dive for $55. Open daily 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.; admission is $7.60.</p>
        <p>Another pleasant diversion is the Jurong Bird Park, west of the city, with its underwater penguin gallery and walk-in tropical aviary. It is open 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday to Friday, and 8 a.m. to 6 p.m. on weekends. Admission is $6.</p>
        <p>Where to Stay</p>
        <p>The Raffles Hotel, 1 Beach Road, (65) 337-1886, fax (65) 339-7650, opened in 1887, was the birthplace of the Singapore Sling, memorialized in prose by Conrad and Maugham. A makeover in the 80's tidied the hotel but replaced the musky charm of its Writers Bar with something more Martha Stewartish. Its 104 suites start at $380. Information: www.raffles.com.</p>
        <p>Less august but more tranquil is the 50-room Duxton Hotel among the shophouses at 83 Duxton Road, adjacent to Chinatown. Aside from its coziness, the Duxton, (65) 227-7678, fax (65) 227-1232, also has what is reckoned by some to be Singapore's best French restaurant, L'Aigle d'Or. Doubles cost $105; www .duxtonhotels.com.sg</p>
        <p>Budget: High ceilings, lazy fans and wooden banisters lend character to the 24-room Sun Sun Hotel, on Middle Road, near Bugis, (65) 338-4911. Doubles, with shared bath, are $23.50, $26.50 with air-conditioning.</p>
        <p>Hotel Bencoolen, 47 Bencoolen Street, (65) 336-0822, fax (65) 336-2250, sparkles from a renovation two years ago and is a short walk from the art museum and the colonial district. There's an outdoor Jacuzzi on the second floor. The 74 rooms start at $49, including breakfast; www.hotelbencoolen.com.sg.</p>
        <p>Luxury: Built in 1900, the 235-room Goodwood Park Hotel, 22 Scotts Road, (65) 737-7411, fax (65) 732-8558, started out as the Teutonia Club and is a short walk from the main shopping district. The decor hasn't changed in 25 years, and its pool, surrounded by turf and white-enamel chaise lounges, is pure Graham Greene. Doubles from $250; www.goodwoodparkhotel.com.sg.</p>
        <p>The Ritz-Carlton, Millenia Singapore, 7 Raffles Avenue, in Marina Square, (65) 337-8888, fax (65) 337-5190, provides superior service and three restaurants. But another attraction is the octagonal windows in each bathroom of the 608 rooms, providing bathing guests views of the downtown skyline. Doubles from $252; www.ritzcarlton.com.</p>
        <p>Where to Eat</p>
        <p>The best food in Singapore is also the cheapest. You can eat your fill of something tasty for less than $6 at  almost any hawker center or food court. For a good selection of local delights, like Hainanese chicken rice or nasi padang, drop into Lau Pa Sat, an old train station at Robinson Road and Cross Street near the financial district that is now an open-air food court. You can pick and choose from the many stalls there.</p>
        <p>For crispy roti prata, a savory pancake served with a curry dip, head to the Casuarina Curry House, a small open-air restaurant on Casuarina Road in Ang Mo Kio. No reservations. Lunch or dinner for two costs about $8.</p>
        <p>For something more elaborate, travel out along the East Coast to the Long Beach Seafood Restaurants, 1018 East Coast Parkway at the Singapore Tennis Center, (65) 445-8833, and 1202 East Coast Parkway, (65) 448-3636. Long Beach claims to have invented black pepper crab, a giant Sri Lankan crustacean suffused with pepper sauce. Equally delicious is Long Beach's chili crab, with its meat-laden piquant sauce. Wear old clothes and roll up your sleeves. Dinner for two with a pitcher of beer is about $60; www.Inesse.com /longbeach/home.html.</p>
        <p>Ivins, 396 Alexandra Road in Bukit Merah, (65) 276-3721, specializes in Singapore's unique Peranakan cuisine, an adaptation of Chinese recipes with Malay ingredients. Try the beef rendang, chicken curry or steamed fish. Dinner for two with beers can be had for under $25.</p>
        <p>Komala Villas, 76 Serangoon Road (65) 294-3294, in Little India, serves delicious South Indian vegetarian thalis, and if you come close to finishing, a waiter is lurking not far away to ladle more onto your banana leaf. Dinner for two, $7.</p>
