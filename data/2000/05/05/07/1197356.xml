        <p>FOR more than two decades, Robert Greenwald, a prolific television producer, has owned the films he made, which gave him the leverage to do such Emmy Award-winning shows as ''The Burning Bed'' and ''A Woman of Independent Means.'' But now Mr. Greenwald, and every other producer of films and series, is under powerful pressure to yield to the networks and allow them to own more and more of their shows.</p>
        <p>''It's not about the money,'' Mr. Greenwald said. ''We all get paid well. It's about the fact that a show you own is your viewpoint, your vision. All that is dissipated when you're a hired hand. You can have the most brilliant people in the world running networks, but it's almost a scientific impossibility for bureaucracies to be inventive and edgy. They cannot. It's their nature.''</p>

        <p>FOR more than two decades, Robert Greenwald, a prolific television producer, has owned the films he made, which gave him the leverage to do such Emmy Award-winning shows as ''The Burning Bed'' and ''A Woman of Independent Means.'' But now Mr. Greenwald, and every other producer of films and series, is under powerful pressure to yield to the networks and allow them to own more and more of their shows.</p>
        <p>''It's not about the money,'' Mr. Greenwald said. ''We all get paid well. It's about the fact that a show you own is your viewpoint, your vision. All that is dissipated when you're a hired hand. You can have the most brilliant people in the world running networks, but it's almost a scientific impossibility for bureaucracies to be inventive and edgy. They cannot. It's their nature.''</p>
        <p>Until five years ago, federal regulations prevented broadcast networks from creating and owning shows, which left the job to independent production companies and studios like Warner Brothers, Fox, Sony and Universal. The thinking was that the networks were so powerful they could lock out projects by independent producers. But in 1995 the Federal Communications Commission lifted the 20-year-old restriction, freeing the networks to aggressively seek financial stakes in and ownership of films, dramatic series and sitcoms.</p>
        <p>The question is, what does this mean to viewers? Is the television landscape, already littered with derivative shows, even more compromised if independent producers are unable to get provocative programs on the air? Or are the complaints just a Hollywood shell game -- one group of rich people getting richer at the expense of another group of rich people? Put another way, was television better 10 years ago than it is today?</p>
        <p>The clearest proof of where the television networks are heading will be evident in New York during the week of May 15. That is when the networks, in their lavish annual presentations to advertisers, will announce their fall schedules. Most of the new comedy and dramatic series will be owned entirely by the networks, or made in partnership with producers. Inevitably -- and despite the denials of network executives -- some shows will be selected simply because they are home-grown. Cynics may recall that in recent years NBC green-lighted such in-house shows as ''Union Square,''  ''Conrad Bloom'' and ''The Mike O'Malley Show.'' Each of them died without a trace, and one can only wonder what shows failed to make it to the air because of the decision to put on those three.</p>
        <p>The decline of independent producers is a reflection not only of increased network ownership of shows but, far more important, of the ascendancy of conglomerates like Disney and Viacom, General Electric and News Corporation, who own the networks. The result is that network executives have also lost considerable independence, further hampering creative programming.</p>
        <p>Two or more decades ago, television was presided over by figures like Grant Tinker, Fred Silverman and Brandon Tartikoff, who held top jobs at NBC, and Barry Diller, a one-time ABC programming executive and the former chairman of Fox. Whatever their flaws, these men were more independent than their counterparts today. At Disney-owned ABC, for example, Lloyd Braun and Stuart Bloomberg, the two talented executives who run the entertainment division, work under the formidable shadow of Michael Eisner, the chairman of the Walt Disney Company and a former ABC executive himself. The fact that Mr. Eisner weighs in on program decisions is an open secret -- and doing so is his prerogative. (Not long ago, he went so far as to personally call Peter Berg, the creator of ''Wonderland,'' to give him script advice. The show failed anyway.) Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of News Corporation, and executives at General Electric and Time Warner are less intrusive than Mr. Eisner, but their voices are heard at Fox and NBC and WB.</p>
        <p>As corporate owners study the bottom line, the mood is bleak. The days are over when a show is allowed to struggle and find an audience, as NBC did with ''Seinfeld'' in 1990. This month, ABC canceled ''Wonderland,'' a drama set in a mental hospital, after only two shows, and NBC dropped the DreamWorks police comedy, ''Battery Park,'' after just four outings.</p>
        <p>''There's no free lunch anymore,'' said Tom Werner, who with his partners, Marcy Carsey and Caryn Mandabach, created ''The Cosby Show,''  ''Roseanne'' and other gold mines. The four pilots his company is now producing are being done in partnership with networks, partly out of necessity, he said. Making 22 episodes of a series can lead to a deficit as high as $15 million before the show is sold to syndication. Partners are needed to defray the costs.</p>
        <p>Currently, CBS and NBC have their own in-house production units and seek out (or demand) partnerships with producers as well. Fox and ABC rely heavily -- although not exclusively -- on shows produced by 20th Century Fox and Disney. Is there any question that networks favor their own shows? It is a subtle issue.</p>
        <p>''Without a doubt, it's a factor that gets in the way,'' said Amy Lippman, the co-creator of Fox's ''Party of Five.''  ''When networks have material that comes from a studio they own, it can't help but weigh in the decision about what gets on the air.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Lippman said that ''Party of Five,'' admittedly in its sixth year, was shifted out of its choice Wednesday night time slot to make room for a Fox-produced comedy, ''Get Real.''  ''Party'' is produced by Columbia-TriStar. '' 'Party of Five' suffered,'' said Ms. Lippman, whose show went off the air this season.</p>
        <p>Steve Levitan, the creator of NBC's ''Just Shoot Me,'' told a similiar story about ''Will and Grace,'' which is produced in part by NBC Studios. ''NBC smelled a hit in 'Will and Grace,' '' he said, ''and poured all their resources and advertising into that show, giving it a great time period, the 'Just Shoot Me' time period,'' meaning Tuesday night at 9. ''It's just that they're favoring their own show. It's not like they're doing something wrong. It's not like, 'How dare they do that?' '' (The fact that ''Shoot Me'' is in its fifth year surely figured in the decision.)</p>
        <p>Another writer-producer, Marshall Herskovitz, said that he and his partner, Edward Zwick, the creators of ''Thirtysomething,'' went out of their way to make a deal with Disney knowing it would give them a leg up with their series ''Once and Again.''</p>
        <p>''We made a deal with Disney knowing they would be the main supplier of ABC,'' Mr. Herskovitz said. ''What we felt was, at best, there was a statistical advantage in being with an in-house production company. By that I mean that, at some odd moment, when a decision is to be made about a show, and all the factors are equal, it would be of some benefit for a network to favor its own show.'' (ABC recently renewed ''Once and Again'' for another season.)</p>
        <p>How this affects creative quality is difficult to assess. Network executives are hardly hacks. Aware that audiences are shrinking in favor of cable and the Internet, they are plainly struggling to come up with shows that are intelligent (NBC's ''West Wing''), funny (Fox's ''Malcolm in the Middle''), adult (ABC's ''Once and Again'') and even a bit risky (NBC's ''Will and Grace''). And they insist that the demise of the independent producer -- and the rise of producing partnerships -- has not altered the creative landscape.</p>
        <p>T HE fact that a producer is affiliated with a studio or a network doesn't mean that half of their brain died,'' said Mr. Braun of ABC. ''Producers are better served by being with a network or a studio because the business is so economically challenging.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Braun denied that ABC goes out of its way to select Disney properties. ''Certainly we'll be as aggressive as possible in building up our studios,'' he said. ''But our mantra is to develop and put the best possible shows on the air, regardless of the source.''</p>
        <p>Similarly, Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television, dismissed the notion that series and films have been diminished. ''You think the creative aesthetic of David Kelley has changed one iota because he's under the Fox banner? Of course not.''</p>
        <p>An unfair example, perhaps. Hugely successful creator-producers like Mr. Kelley (''The Practice,''  ''Ally McBeal'') and Steven Bochco (''N.Y.P.D. Blue''), whose companies are now aligned with studios, are given creative carte blanche. Most independent producers are under seige.</p>
        <p>Television was once dominated by powerhouse producers like Norman Lear, Aaron Spelling, Witt-Thomas-Harris, Carsey-Werner, Lorimar and others. By all accounts, some of the shows they made -- ''Soap,'' ''All in the Family,''  ''Benson,''  ''Maude,'' ''Golden Girls'' -- would probably not pass muster today. The lead characters would not fit snugly into the prized youth market: they are too old, too ethnic, too female. ''Try doing a show today like 'Golden Girls,' about three older women,'' said one top network executive. ''Good luck!''</p>
        <p>Some of those producers, like Carsey-Werner-Mandabach and Mr. Spelling, still work in television, but their number has dwindled. When this reporter called Michael Jaffe, a well-known producer, and said he was doing an article about independent television producers, Mr. Jaffe replied, with some hyperbole: ''You're doing a short story. There are only two of us left.'' Mr. Jaffe said there were probably only 10 producers making films for television, in contrast to 30 or 40 in the 80's.</p>
        <p>But a handful of powerful producers has entered the field -- Basic Entertainment (formerly Brillstein-Grey), Regency Television and the Robert Greenblatt-David Janollari studio, among them. Artists Television Group, a newcomer, has made 12 pilots for the new season. All of which suggests that, despite changes wrought by the F.C.C. decision, there is work to go around.</p>
        <p>Increasingly, producers are turning to the flourishing cable networks, where, as Variety reported last week, wealthy corporate parents like Time Warner and Viacom are willing to pay the costs of series and films. (A one-hour series on basic cable can cost about $1.3 million an episode, only slightly less than the $1.5 million price of a broadcast show; a two-hour cable film can cost $7 million to $10 million.)</p>
        <p>''We embraced the new world,'' said Mr. Jaffe, whose company made more than a half-dozen films for cable last year. ''The partnerships are somewhat complicated because it's all new business. We're paving the landscape as we go.''</p>
        <p>Ultimately, said Gail Berman, president of Regency Television, the producer of Fox's successful sitcom ''Malcolm in the Middle,'' whether or not studios own series and films is not the issue. ''The audience doesn't know, doesn't care about vertical integration,'' Ms. Berman said. The issue, she said, is a straightforward one. Without better programming, the viewers won't be there. ''They'll just flip the channel.''</p>
