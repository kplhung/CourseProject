        <p>Americans took home some 2.8 billion prescriptions last year, obtaining some of the newest, most heavily advertised and most expensive drugs. They bought many of those medications as members of managed care drug plans run by pharmacy benefit managers, companies that arrange discounts from retail drugstores and often operate mail-order pharmacies on behalf of employer health plans.</p>
        <p>Now the pharmacy benefit management companies, or P.B.M.'s, which handle drug benefits for 200 million Americans, are being assigned an important role in widely discussed proposals to add a drug benefit to Medicare.</p>
        <p>Supporters of a Medicare drug benefit, including President Clinton, believe that the pharmacy benefit managers could obtain discounts from pharmacists and rebates from drugmakers for all Medicare beneficiaries, just as they are expected to do for employer health plans and Medicare health maintenance organizations. The managers, sponsors suggest, would help rein in the costs of the new Medicare program.</p>
        <p>But pharmacy benefit managers are coming under increasing scrutiny. Justice Department officials are investigating possible illegal kickbacks. Pending lawsuits contend that some pharmacy benefit managers have violated their duty to act in the best interest of patients. State regulators are weighing concerns about the absence of oversight of the industry.</p>
        <p>At Senate Finance Committee hearings in March on the Medicare proposals, the General Accounting Office questioned whether pharmacy benefit managers would be able to control costs under government disclosure requirements. And health care experts say that even for private companies, drug benefit managers have not been able to put a lid on surging costs.</p>
        <p>''P.B.M.'s or no P.B.M.'s, it does not have much effect on the growth trend in pharmaceutical expenses,'' said Henry Aaron, a health care economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington.</p>
        <p>The drug benefit managers do perform valuable services. They handle billions of automated transactions, checking plan members' eligibility online and eliminating mountains of paperwork. They also monitor the drug-buying behavior of individuals, helping people avoid dangerous drug combinations. And for an extra fee from the health plan, they will remind people with serious health problems to follow their doctors' orders.</p>
        <p>But though nearly three in four Americans are in drug plans, by the industry's count, national spending on drugs is growing three times as fast as overall health care spending, which itself rose about 6 percent in 1999. Employers' health care expenses were a big factor in the 4.3 percent rise in labor costs in the year ended in March, the biggest increase since the early 1990's. Drug expenditures will double in five years to $200 billion and rise to $300 billion by 2010 if the current pace continues, said C. Daniel Mullins, a pharmaceutical economist at the University of Maryland.</p>
        <p>Pharmacy benefit managers say they can slow the pace for health plans that are willing to place tight limits on members' drug choices. Drug costs, they add, would rise even faster without their industry's efforts.</p>
        <p>''A third of the increases is from increased utilization,'' or more people using more drugs, said Judith Cahill, executive director of the Academy of Managed Care Pharmacy, an industry-supported professional group of pharmacists. ''A third is from new, improved products, and a third is from plain old vanilla inflation in the cost of products.''</p>
        <p>Employers are feeling the cost pressures. ''The largest component in employers' health costs is not in-patient care, not out-patient care or doctors' office visits or X-rays; it is prescription drugs,'' said Raymond Brusca, vice president for benefits at the Black &amp; Decker Corporation.</p>
        <p>Many health plans have raised premiums and shifted a larger portion of the price of a prescription to employees and their families. Others, mindful of union concerns and competition for employees in a tight labor market, have swallowed hard and absorbed the increases.</p>
        <p>General Motors was one of the first big employers to hire a pharmacy benefit management company, in the 1980's. G.M. spent $762 million on drugs in its self-insured plans last year, up nearly 13 percent from 1998. The company recently hired a doctor of pharmacy to work with the P.B.M. to try to tame these costs.</p>
        <p>Rob Moroni, the company's assistant director of health plans, said G.M. expected a cost increase of about 20 percent this year, fueled by large numbers of older retirees covered by the company's plan. Elderly people typically take three times as many drugs as people under 65.</p>
        <p>After several mergers last year, the pharmacy benefit management market is largely controlled by the three largest concerns. Merck-Medco, PCS Health Systems and Express Scripts say they have three-quarters of the country's P.B.M. business.</p>
        <p>Efforts by those companies and by the other pharmacy benefit managers to control costs have largely been stymied. The savings from discounts that pharmacy benefit managers get from drugstores are reduced by manufacturers' price increases and swept away by intense customer demand for advertised drugs, which are typically more expensive than alternative products. Drugmakers spent $1.9 billion on consumer advertising last year, according to Scott-Levin, a research firm in Newtown, Pa. And sales of prescription drugs rose 18 percent, compared with 1998 sales, according to IMS Health Inc., a market research firm in Westport, Conn.</p>
        <p>Industry experts say the pharmacy benefit managers, which typically charge employers up to 50 cents for each transaction as well as other fees, have strong incentives to increase the use of drugs.</p>
        <p>''With an increase in utilization, the P.B.M.'s get more money,'' said Debbie Stern, vice president of Rxperts Managed Care Consulting, a drug consulting firm in Irvine, Calif.</p>
        <p>What is more, drugmakers promote new and highly competitive -- often more expensive -- products by giving the pharmacy benefit managers rebates based on sales. (The rebates may or may not be shared with employers.) That system, critics say, encourages P.B.M.'s to choose higher priced drugs.</p>
        <p>''I haven't seen anybody giving rebates on generics,'' the lowest-priced drugs, said Patricia Wilson, a pharmaceuticals consultant based in Rosemont, Pa.</p>
        <p>The transaction fees that employers pay for the billions of prescriptions filled each year mount up. But Barrett Toan, chief executive of Express Scripts, said these fees merely ''cover expenses to process those claims.'' He said his customers were reluctant to authorize harsh limits on drug benefits that might antagonize their employees at a time of low unemployment.</p>
        <p>At the heart of the pharmacy benefit management business is a list, or formulary, of preferred drugs. The employee or health plan member has a lower copayment on these products, an incentive to choose them. In theory, the preferred drugs -- which include many generic versions of drugs that have lost patent protection -- are as good as or better than any in their class as well as the most cost-effective.</p>
        <p>But lawsuits filed on behalf of drug plan members over the last three years in Federal courts in several states argue that sponsors of managed care drug plans are violating their fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of patients rather than for company profits, as required by the federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act, or Erisa. Several of the suits have been filed against Merck-Medco, a unit of Merck &amp; Company, and at least one is against PCS, which is owned by the Rite-Aid Corporation.</p>
        <p>Spokesmen for PCS and Merck-Medco said the lawsuits were without merit.</p>
        <p>''We believe we have a long history of developing plans and programs that are designed to benefit plan sponsors and plan members, with the ultimate goal of saving money for those plan sponsors and plan members,'' said John Bloomfield, a spokesman for Merck-Medco.</p>
        <p>Some critics have raised questions about how much pharmacy benefit managers really save employer health plans. These companies typically offer large employers discounts of 12 percent to 15 percent, which come out of the retail pharmacy's pocket. The discounts are subtracted from manufacturers' posted average wholesale prices. But those prices may be inflated. ''They are not an average, not wholesale and not a price, other than what employers pay,'' Ms. Wilson, the pharmaceuticals consultant, said.</p>
        <p>While a customer waits at the drug counter, a computer screen displays the terms of her insurance: the discount from list price, a dispensing fee of $2.50 or so for the pharmacist, the customer's other prescriptions and recent purchases, and her copayment. The health plan typically gets an electronic bill for most of the charge.</p>
        <p>The drugmakers' prices are flexible, depending on the buyer. ''They set a price that they think they can get away with,'' said Uwe Reinhardt, a health care economist at Princeton University.</p>
        <p>New drugs are frequently introduced, and some are priced 20 or 30 times as much as older treatments for the same illnesses. Drug prices increased 5.2 percent in the 12 months ended in March, while the cost of medical care including drugs rose only 3.9 percent and overall consumer prices were up 3.7 percent, according to the Labor Department.</p>
        <p>Richard T. Clark, president of Merck-Medco, said health plans -- employers and their workers -- pay prices that are ''15 percent lower on average'' than people without insurance.</p>
        <p>Still, because the pharmacy benefit managers and the drugmakers can keep their price decisions well out of public view, questions continue to arise. The National Association of State Insurance Commissioners is considering whether to recommend legislation to regulate the industry. Kathleen Sibelius, the Kansas insurance commissioner, said there was ''a growing concern about the monopoly of control by pharmacy benefit managers who currently are not under a regulatory umbrella, are not licensed or reviewed.''</p>
        <p>''They aren't screened in any way, but they may have a significant impact on access to prescription drugs and costs associated with that access,'' she added.</p>
        <p>William J. Scanlon, director of health financing issues at the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress, advised the Senate Finance Committee in March that if the drug benefit managers' role in Medicare was expanded, the pharmacy managers would have to give up the secrecy that now cloaks their pricing deals.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department has subpoenaed records of PCS and Merck-Medco, the two biggest pharmacy benefit management companies, in an inquiry over the fiduciary duty to drug plan members and whether certain types of payments to the industry involve kickbacks. No charges have been filed. Both companies said they comply with the laws and were cooperating with the investigation.</p>
        <p>Jim Sheehan, chief of the civil division in the United States Attorney's office in Philadelphia, who is heading the Justice Department inquiry, said there was ''a tension'' between the benefits that pharmacy benefit managers provide and ''where they make their money.'' He added, ''The efficiencies in the business are in the claims processing and the mail order services; the money is in the rebates.''</p>
        <p>Chris Jennings, a White House adviser on health policy, said the administration's Medicare proposal would include requirements to enhance the quality of service to Medicare enrollees. The plan, he said, was built on ''taking the best private practices and avoiding the worst.''</p>
