        <p>BY the time Ali Ryerson met Joe Beck in late 1996, the pair had more than 50 combined years in the jazz business. They saw, in each other, what they wanted and wasted no time forming a musical alliance.</p>
        <p>''Joe was working at Poor Henry's in New Milford with keyboardist Pete Levin,'' Ms. Ryerson, a flutist, said over breakfast recently. ''Pete, who's an old friend of mine, asked me to stop by to meet Joe and sit in. I did. Musically, it just clicked with Joe.''</p>

        <p>BY the time Ali Ryerson met Joe Beck in late 1996, the pair had more than 50 combined years in the jazz business. They saw, in each other, what they wanted and wasted no time forming a musical alliance.</p>
        <p>''Joe was working at Poor Henry's in New Milford with keyboardist Pete Levin,'' Ms. Ryerson, a flutist, said over breakfast recently. ''Pete, who's an old friend of mine, asked me to stop by to meet Joe and sit in. I did. Musically, it just clicked with Joe.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Beck, a guitarist, seated beside Ms. Ryerson, finished his partner's thought. ''I called her the next morning. Said we should be working together. That's how it started.''</p>
        <p>Within a month the duo was off and touring the East, from Florida to Boston, leaving little doubt that theirs was an inevitable union. Ms. Ryerson, who grew up in Armonk and now lives in Brookfield, Conn., had played the same local clubs as Mr. Beck, a resident of Weston, Conn.</p>
        <p>They have since played some of the most prestigious clubs in America and Europe and will perform next Sunday at the Towne Crier Cafe in Pawling.</p>
        <p>Next week their recent concert with the legendary Billy Taylor at the Kennedy Center in Washington will be broadcast on National Public Radio.</p>
        <p>''I believe I play my best with Ali,'' Mr. Beck said. ''I don't know why. Neither of us are overpowering players. It's inexplicable.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Ryerson explained the relationship this way: ''I think we have similar taste in music. As for why certain musicians work well together, it's often a mystery.''</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Beck and Ms. Ryerson had long since established their solo careers in the studio. Ms. Ryerson is from a musical family. Her father recorded with Bing Crosby, Perry Como, Fats Waller, Louis Armstrong, Tony Bennett, Elvis Presley, Ella Fitzgerald and Paul Whiteman.</p>
        <p>Like her three brothers, Ms. Ryerson studied music at Western Connecticut State University in Danbury for nearly three years. She left to tour North America with the Billy Fellows Show as a soloist, pianist and arranger. Upon her return, she resumed her studies at the Hartt College of Music at the University of Hartford, earning a bachelor's degree in 1979.</p>
        <p>She has had various jobs, including playing with a Baroque trio and recording 10 albums for such jazz labels as Red Baron and Concord.</p>
        <p>Mr. Beck grew up in New Jersey, the son of ''two amateur musicians.'' In 1963, at 18, he moved to New York, where he worked with Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, Maynard Ferguson, Larry Coryell and James Brown. Mr. Beck spent the better part of 30 years writing, arranging and producing jingles on Madison Avenue.</p>
        <p>''Studio work and real music should never be confused,'' he said. ''You do that work, three or four sessions a day, and you have no desire to do your own music. I didn't do anything for myself for 20 years, when I met Ali.''</p>
        <p>He said his studio work continues to open doors for him. ''Having Miles Davis and Sinatra on your resume certainly helps.''</p>
        <p>Tickets for Mr. Beck and Ms.  Ryerson's performance next Sunday at the Towne Crier Cafe on Route 22 in Pawling, are $20. The number to call for reservations is 855-1300.</p>
