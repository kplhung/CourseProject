        <p>A TEMPEST is brewing in Washington, all because of an 11-inch blonde bombshell.</p>
        <p>Mattel, in association with two nonprofit women's groups, recently announced plans for a Barbie for President 2000 doll, a power-suited, high-heeled White House hopeful who comes complete with a pearl necklace and a Girls' Bill of Rights.

        <p>A TEMPEST is brewing in Washington, all because of an 11-inch blonde bombshell.</p>
        <p>Mattel, in association with two nonprofit women's groups, recently announced plans for a Barbie for President 2000 doll, a power-suited, high-heeled White House hopeful who comes complete with a pearl necklace and a Girls' Bill of Rights. Mattel says it hopes the doll will ''broaden girls' vision of what's possible.''</p>
        <p>Almost immediately the protests sounded. Last week in an article on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times, the former Colorado congresswoman and one-time presidential candidate Patricia Schroeder assailed the plastic politico as a giant leap backward for womankind. ''Why should we feel great about a message that says a woman can go to the White House if she looks like Barbie?'' Ms. Schroeder asked. ''I'm sorry, but I just can't get enthusiastic.''</p>
        <p>Then again, why shouldn't American children learn about civics and the virtues of public service via their favorite playthings? Rather than jeer at this star-spangled Barbie, let's extend the concept to other shelves at Toy Barn.</p>
        <p>Senator Potato Head -- What better way to teach the country's youth about the versatility of the modern politician than by crossing a United States senator with everybody's favorite synthetic spud? But instead of the traditional plug-in eyes, nose, lips and limbs, Senator Potato Head (Independent of Idaho) comes equipped with interchangeable position papers, a removable spine and a special ''two-face'' feature that allows the toy tater to talk out of both sides of its mouth. (Manufacturer's note: On the Dan Quayle model of Senator Potatoe Head, the extra ''e'' is sold separately.)</p>
        <p>Tickle Me Reno -- The events of recent weeks have put a clearly beleaguered Attorney General Janet Reno back in the national spotlight. Lest children believe the job of A.G. is completely joyless, here comes a fluffy, happy effigy of the nation's top cop that giggles and chortles on command. This huggable toy was developed after several failures, notably the ill-fated Tickle Me Zoe and Tickle Me Kimba dolls, which, despite repeated efforts, never found anything to laugh at.</p>
        <p>G.I. Joe Lockhart -- Gone are the battle fatigues, helmet and rifle. In their place a tailored gray suit, briefing book and White House podium. Still, G.I. Joe Lockhart, a pocket-sized version of the embattled press secretary, is every bit as prepped for trench warfare as his fox-holed predecessor -- he's the ultimate spin-controlling war machine. Roll up his sleeves and let him slug it out with Sam Donaldson; slip on his windbreaker and breeze him past reporters as he boards the presidential chopper (not included). This is truly one ''fighting Joe from head to toe.'' (Coming soon: A special two-pack that includes a companion Helen Thomas doll.)</p>
        <p>Curious George Stephanapoulos -- Kids will love this video adaptation of the classic book series starring the former White House aide as the mischievous monkey. The first three releases: ''Curious George Goes to Washington,'' ''Curious George Writes a Memoir'' and ''Curious George Can't Get His Calls Returned.'' (James Carville co-stars as the Man in the Yellow Hat.)</p>
        <p>Talking Head Teletubbies -- That colorful quartet of cuddlies with antennae on their heads and TV screens in their bellies now features running political commentary on the tummy monitors, courtesy of America's leading pundits. Each Teletubbie is assigned its own talking head -- Tinky Winky (Tim Russert), Dipsy (George Will), Laa-Laa (Cokie Roberts) and Po (Matt Drudge) -- which means tykes can play in silence for hours on end as their adorable Tubbies hash it out among themselves. (Plans for the Charlie Rose Teletubbie were canceled when manufacturers were unable to get the doll to stop talking.)</p>
        <p>Jujitsu Justices -- Step aside, Justice Scalia; take a powder, Ms. O'Connor -- there's a new Supreme Court in town. The first Mighty Morphin Power Rangers to sit on the high bench, this collector's set of robed action figures metes out justice in ways the Rehnquist court can only dream about. Miranda warning? Forget about it. First Amendment? You've got to be kidding. This gang totes lasers, not gavels. Case closed.</p>
        <p>Pokemonica -- And you thought Pikachu was the coolest member of the gang -- well, here comes the toughest pocket monster of them all. The only Pokemon character to have survived battles with such nemeses as Starrmander and Trippleypuff, Pokemonica is available in a variety of sizes, comes with her own sports car and designer cell phone, and boasts a wardrobe of more than two dozen dresses. None of them blue.</p>
