        <p>FRETTING over what to wear to her daughter's wedding, Ilene Beckerman experienced an instant of panic. ''Everybody remembers Princess Diana's wedding dress, but who remembers what her mother wore?'' she told herself soothingly. ''Nobody pays attention to the mother of the bride.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Beckerman knows better, of course. Taut as a snare drum, smooth and polished as an apple, the mother of the bride these days is apt to be as raptly scrutinized and cooed over as the bride herself. With that in mind, Ms. Beckerman, who chronicles her experiences in a new book, ''Mother of the Bride'' (Algonqin, $17.95), which she wrote and illustrated, resolved not to fade into the marquetry at her own daughter's wedding. Bypassing the discreet beige that more conventional women trot out for such occasions, she chose a decollete number that riveted all eyes to her chest.</p>

        <p>FRETTING over what to wear to her daughter's wedding, Ilene Beckerman experienced an instant of panic. ''Everybody remembers Princess Diana's wedding dress, but who remembers what her mother wore?'' she told herself soothingly. ''Nobody pays attention to the mother of the bride.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Beckerman knows better, of course. Taut as a snare drum, smooth and polished as an apple, the mother of the bride these days is apt to be as raptly scrutinized and cooed over as the bride herself. With that in mind, Ms. Beckerman, who chronicles her experiences in a new book, ''Mother of the Bride'' (Algonqin, $17.95), which she wrote and illustrated, resolved not to fade into the marquetry at her own daughter's wedding. Bypassing the discreet beige that more conventional women trot out for such occasions, she chose a decollete number that riveted all eyes to her chest.</p>
        <p>Her dress was not, in a word, standard-issue mother-of-the-bride, or M.O.B., garment-speak for a category of dress that is fast outgrowing the decorous frocks of old. ''The time of wearing a pale tunic and skirt is way past,'' said Rachel R. Leonard, the fashion director of Bride magazine, an industry bible. ''It's a much hipper category than ever before.''</p>
        <p>''The mentality of the mother of the bride changed,'' said the designer Carolina Herrera, who is often consulted for weddings by the gilded set. ''She no longer wants the gray chiffon or the little lace dress.''</p>
        <p>Not by a long stretch. Carole Gabay, 62, is typical of the militantly modern new mother of the bride. ''Wear a beige dress with sequins?'' snapped Mrs. Gabay, a retired beauty industry executive living in Boca Raton, Fla. ''No way! I jog four miles a day, I'm a size 6, and I wanted to look like myself.'' For her daughter Madeline's wedding in New York last June, she wore a pink strapless gown with sheer inserts that showed off her legs to the hips -- ''tasteful but certainly sexy,'' she said. ''It could have been construed as a dress you wear to one of those awards shows.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Gabay shares with many of her contemporaries a giddy fascination with such media extravaganzas. Not less than the stars, they crave their moment in the limelight.</p>
        <p>''Women now have a really strong picture of how they want to look,'' said Nadine Lopez Knudsen, a New York couturier, who frequently outfits wedding parties. ''I guess the influence is Hollywood. We all want a little glamour in our lives.''</p>
        <p>Displaying a competitiveness bred by long years in the workplace, many women seem to envision a daughter's wedding as a crowning moment of their own lives -- a time to celebrate personal triumphs.</p>
        <p>''Nowadays, between going to the gym and plastic surgery, everybody looks younger longer,'' said Frank Composto, a New York fashion designer.</p>
        <p>In some cases, mothers are motivated by the desire to take center stage at the kind of fairy-tale wedding they never had themselves.</p>
        <p>''The vast majority of women I dress at least give lip service that they do not want to overtrump the bride,'' said Vera Wang, the doyenne of lavish New York weddings, who sells her body-skimming evening wear to many mothers of the bride. ''In reality, however, I have done some things so sensual, so sexy, that they could have gone to the Oscars.''</p>
        <p>These days such showstoppers might include a Champagne-tone number designed by Craig Natiello of Halston, which Joanne de Guardiola plans to wear to the wedding of her stepdaughter, Jeanne, in Southhampton on June 17. ''It's gorgeous, very classic and form-fitting,'' breathed Mrs. de Guardiola, describing a dress that was cut to follow her size 6 frame.</p>
        <p>The dresses vary in mood from a minimalist black jersey leotard top and skirt by Ms. Wang that was worn in 1996 by Sandy Perlbinder, a New York filmmmaker, to a pull-out-all-the-stops confection designed by Mr. Composto for Alinda Wyckert, a Texas socialite. Complete with a black bustier and a cabbage-rose-clotted skirt, it included a bustle and an elaborate train.</p>
        <p>''Sharon Stone saw its likeness at a White House dinner and loved it,'' Mr. Composto boasted.</p>
        <p>Phyllis Finkel, a personal shopper who dresses many mothers of the bride, said: ''Mothers all adore their daughters, but sometimes they forget that the wedding is not their affair. Nine times out of 10, they will tell you, 'I want simple, I want sleek, I want nothing on the dress.' '' But then comes the transformation. ''They end up as embellished as a party gift,'' Mrs. Finkel said, sighing. ''All those tulle buttoms and bustier tops. All they need is a veil, and you could push them down the aisle.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Finkel works hard to prevent such lapses. She was clearly not on hand, however, at one wedding chosen by the mother of the bride as her own moment to shine. As her daughter told a bridesmaid, the mother pressured her to wear a conventional, nondescript frock bought off the rack for $300. Then she was utterly eclipsed by her mother, a vibrant bird of paradise in custom-designed raspberry satin, a coal-size gemstone fastened to her chest. According to the bridesmaid, the mother had never had a wedding of her own and was making up for lost time.</p>
        <p>But such strenuous efforts to compete are more the exception than the rule. More typical is Mrs. Pearlbinder of the leotard-bodice Vera Wang. ''All I really wanted was to feel young in what I was choosing,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Beckerman, who subtitled her book ''The Dream, the Reality, the Search for the Perfect Dress,'' acknowledged that she lacked the discipline to shed pounds for a contour-skimming siren dress. Seeking the safety of the traditional, she tried on, and discarded, a pink and violet chiffon print (''Lady Bird Johnson would have loved it,'' she writes) and a turquoise crepe (''I looked like a wall in a hospital'') before settling on something more daring.</p>
        <p>The dress she wore plunged precipitously, though it covered the proverbial multitude of sins. Ms. Beckerman said, ''I learned a long time ago, if you show a little cleavage, nobody ever looks anywhere else.''</p>
