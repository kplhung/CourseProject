      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The county's Department of Social Services has frozen referrals to Leake &amp; Watts, a Yonkers residential child care center. The action on April 26 followed the arrest of a Leake &amp; Watts employee last month in connection with the rapes of four Manhattan women. Also last month, a former child care worker at Leake &amp; Watts was indicted in the rape and sodomy of two teenage residents of the center. Five children from Westchester are at the Yonkers center, but the two who were raped were not from the county, said Nancy Travers, deputy commissioner for the Department of Social Services. Not satisfied with the administration's response, Andrea Stewart-Cousins, a Democratic county legislator from Yonkers, is calling on the county to take broader action and reconsider a contract it has with Leake &amp; Watts to run Woodfield Cottage, a detention center in Valhalla.</p>
