        <p>THE Paris Commune of 1871 is one of those smoldering ash heaps in French history, like the 1968 riots, stirred habitually by left and right to inflame old class allegiances and fears. To the left, the Communards are secular martyrs who refused to accept the humiliating peace imposed by Bismarck after the Prussian army crushed the French in 1870. With Napoleon III readily conceding defeat, these die-hard nationalists had no choice but to replace the capitulators with leaders of their own. To the right, the Commune is a vital lesson in the perils of social disorder. Without respect for the central authority of the state, chaos ensues and Robespierre's reign of terror is reborn.</p>
        <p>One uncontested fact in the struggle over national memory is the bloody trauma of the uprising. In 72 days during the spring of 1871, many of the official symbols of Parisian culture and might were leveled by Commune arsonists or stray artillery shells from government troops. The Palais de Tuileries and the Hotel de Ville were set ablaze and gutted; the Louvre, Palais de Justice, Palais Royal and Notre Dame were slated for destruction but saved by fire brigades. Generals, priests, judges, even the Archbishop of Paris were put to death by the Commune. But the government exiled in Versailles soon recaptured the city, hunted down the rebels and exacted a brutal revenge. The numbers tell the story. Perhaps 1,000 Versailles soldiers died in actual fighting compared with 4,000 Communards, while 17,000 to 20,000 others were executed by the Third Republic, more than perished in any battle during the Franco-Prussian war.</p>

        <p>One uncontested fact in the struggle over national memory is the bloody trauma of the uprising. In 72 days during the spring of 1871, many of the official symbols of Parisian culture and might were leveled by Commune arsonists or stray artillery shells from government troops. The Palais de Tuileries and the Hotel de Ville were set ablaze and gutted; the Louvre, Palais de Justice, Palais Royal and Notre Dame were slated for destruction but saved by fire brigades. Generals, priests, judges, even the Archbishop of Paris were put to death by the Commune. But the government exiled in Versailles soon recaptured the city, hunted down the rebels and exacted a brutal revenge. The numbers tell the story. Perhaps 1,000 Versailles soldiers died in actual fighting compared with 4,000 Communards, while 17,000 to 20,000 others were executed by the Third Republic, more than perished in any battle during the Franco-Prussian war.</p>
        <p>As the first news event in French history covered by photographers, the Commune and its aftermath also left a unique visual record, as a compelling new exhibition at the Musee d'Orsay, on view until June 11, makes clear. ''La Commune Photographiee'' is a small show, with fewer than 100 prints, but the curator, Quentin Bajac, has chosen his examples well. Instead of taking sides, either political or artistic, he has exposed the multiple identities of photography at the time, illustrating how the Communards and the state adapted the medium for their own ends. Whether used to document common people in the streets or to meditate on the nature of ruins, to produce mug shots for wanted posters of the rebels or to embellish bizarre tableaus for government propaganda, photography emerges in this show as politicized as the events themselves.</p>
        <p>Bruno Braquehais (1823-75) is one of the few photographers to have made a name for himself as a chronicler of the Communards. While others took out their cameras only after much of the city had been razed after May 1871, this deaf-mute who had begun his career as a daguerreotypist made group portraits of the armed men as they occupied the streets and public buildings. His series before and after the destruction of the Vendome column on May 16 is an early example of photographic reportage. Posing face-front with their swords unsheathed and caps doffed, the masses of men (along with a few women and children) are a ragtag army -- more shooting party than military machine. But Braquehais has captured the pleasure they take in one another's company as well as their childish joy in having toppled a monument to Napoleon's martial prowess in the heart of the fashionable Right Bank.</p>
        <p>For pure photographic thrills, however, nothing in the show matches the many crisp and sensual wet-plate images of charred ruins. No other city in the world is as proud of keeping up appearances as Paris. To see Hyppolyte-August Collard's long exposure of ghostly passers-by stopping to ogle the jagged shell of the Hotel de Ville, or Alphonse Liebert's study of the eviscerated Theatre Lyrique, a protomodernist abstraction of twisted wire and bare concrete, can evoke feelings of loss along with hard-to-suppress anarchic glee.</p>
        <p>Photographers, as they surveyed their once-tidy capital, seemed also to oscillate between sadness and astonishment. As they had when Baron Haussmann's decrees bulldozed old neighborhoods in the 1850's, they seized the opportunity to peer into the intestinal structure of a city known until then mainly by its graceful and often pompous facades. More than one art historian, while examining these lovely X-rays of ashen destruction, has glimpsed the roots of French surrealism. (A fine selection of digitized photographs and artifacts from the Siege and Commune of Paris is available at www.library.nwu.edu/spec/siege.)</p>
        <p>These are the best-known images from the Commune, the devastating effects of the uprising on the physical plan of Paris. Less familiar but no less intriguing are the ways in which photography helped pro-government forces to identify the rebels and to make a dramatic case of their crimes against humanity.</p>
        <p>The key figure in this activity is Ernest Eugene Appert (1831-90?), a painter manque whose works dominate the last third of the exhibition. Fervently pro-Versaillais, he produced not only portraits of the Communards as they awaited trial in prison -- when arranged on a grid they read as wanted posters -- but also a series of small tableaus that may be the first political photomontages. His ''Crimes of the Commune,'' made between 1871 and 1873, illustrate in some 17 scenes the deaths by firing squad of priests, hostages, generals and other opponents brutally liquidated by the Commune. The realism of the photograph meets the fantasy of a zealot in these re-creations of history. Pasting the photographed heads and bodies of the victims onto photographs of the scenes of the crimes, Appert arranged events as he imagined they had happened.</p>
        <p>The artist Jules Raudnitz (1815-72) brings 19th-century photography even closer to standard postmodern practice. In his series ''Bloody Sabbath'' he photographed reliefs, sculptured by an unknown artist, depicting various famous events from the Commune saga, then photographed and hand-colored them as stereograph slides.</p>
        <p>To exhibit these photographs anywhere but the Musee d'Orsay, converted in 1986 from the Gare d'Orsay, the grandiose train station built in 1900 over the ruins of the Palais d'Orsay, which was itself burned to the ground in 1870, might lack historic resonance. But one startling lesson of the show -- the several ingenious ends for which photography was a means when it was barely 30 years old -- holds true for many nations and periods. Would that the American Civil War, so much vaster in its photographic scope but so often viewed in books and exhibitions as little more than a series of sober documents by Brady, Gardner, O'Sullivan and Barnard, could have as refreshing a revision.</p>
