        <p>Sociologists speak of the public space as the ''commons.'' While such space is crucial to the quality of life, it is undefined and in a sense formless and will always be exploited by a free-market economy unless restrained by the government.</p>
        <p>Clearly our government has failed us in the case of billboards as it has in the case of other forms of pollution, such as noise. Though the article suggests that New Yorkers enjoy billboards as it is often said that they enjoy noise, any survey will show that a huge majority detests both.</p>
        <p>The problem is that the majority in these cases has no organizational strength, the encroaching minority is unrestrained and no one with authority seems to be aware of what's happening on their watch. The idea that billboards are a protected freedom of speech makes as much sense as that tiny minority of dog-owners once did when they claimed that scooper laws compromised their civil rights.</p>
