        <p>Deborah Marie Kinzer and Andrew Craig Morrison were married yesterday by the Rev. Dr. Arthur Caliandro at Marble Collegiate Church in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kinzer, 49, will keep her name. She is a vice president of CDC North America in Manhattan, a unit of Caisse des Depots et Consignations of Paris, an investment firm. She received a bachelor's degree magna cum laude in Japanese and theoretical linguistics from Georgetown University and an M.B.A. from the University of Pennsylvania. She is a daughter of May V. Kinzer of Middleburg Heights, Ohio, and the late Robert A. Kinzer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Morrison, 57, is known as Craig. He is an architect in New York specializing in preservation and restoration. He received a bachelor's degree in architecture from the University of Michigan and a master's degree in historic preservation from Columbia. Mr. Morrison, whose previous marriage ended in divorce, has one son. The bridegroom is the son of the late Dorothy Morrison and the late Andrew Morrison.</p>
        <p>The couple met last year on a pilgrimage to Israel sponsored by Marble Collegiate. ''We were each looking for a bus buddy,'' said Mr. Morrison, who is interested in biblical architecture. Not giving in to jet lag, they explored Jerusalem while others in the tour group napped.</p>
        <p>They visited the 1898 German Lutheran Church of the Redeemer, said to have been built on the ruins of a hospital founded by the Crusaders. Climbing to the church tower, Mr. Morrison thought it romantic that the bells rang for 15 minutes. Ms. Kinzer recalls wondering why they rang so long.</p>
        <p>On returning to Manhattan, where both live, they began to date. ''We both like bacon cheeseburgers and Frank Lloyd Wright,'' Ms. Kinzer said.</p>
        <p>In January, they were having Sunday brunch in the social hall of Marble Collegiate. Mr. Morrison unexpectedly talked about engagement rings. Suddenly, he thrust out both fists and said to her, ''Pick a hand, any hand.''</p>
        <p>As she was about to do so, another man in the social hall dropped by their table and started chatting with Ms. Kinzer.</p>
        <p>''This guy was hitting on her while I was trying to propose,'' Mr. Morrison said.</p>
        <p>Finally, she shooed the other man away. She picked Mr. Morrison's right hand. It contained his grandmother's engagement ring.</p>
