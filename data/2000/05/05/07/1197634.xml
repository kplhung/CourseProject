        <p>Interest-rate worries continued to weigh heavily on the market, keeping volume low and buyers scarce.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average ended at 10,577.86, off 1.5 percent. The Nasdaq composite index settled at 3,816.82, off 1 percent, while the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index also ended down 1 percent, at 1,432.62. But the S&amp;P had a gain of 23.06 points Friday, its biggest in about two weeks.</p>
        <p>Stocks started the week strong as investors shrugged off worries about the future of Microsoft, fueling a rally in technology that spread to the broader market.</p>
        <p>But stocks began to fall after economic data released throughout the week showed little evidence of a slowdown, prompting speculation that the Federal Reserve wold raise interest rates by as much as half a percentage point next week.</p>
        <p>The economy is still going full blast, which means the Fed will almost certainly raise rates, said Christopher J. Wolfe, an equity strategist at J.P. Morgan. And there could be more rate hikes after this one.</p>
        <p>Among the big losers last week were financial stocks, which are highly sensitive to interest rate changes.</p>
