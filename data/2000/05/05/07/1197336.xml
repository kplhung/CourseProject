        <p>Alan Wolfe article summarizes The New York Times Magazine's poll finding that most Americans wish to decide for themselves what is right, good and meaningful, without advice of strong superiors, moral or otherwise; observes that Americans have strong faith in faith, but also a distaste for theological doctrine that has informed national morality from early Puritanism, so that, while there is a moral majority, it is unwilling to follow anyone's party line about what morality ought to be; adds that because Americans are increasingly on their own when it comes to finding right way to live, autonomy means different things to different people (M)</p>

        <p>At least since 1845, when Henry David Thoreau took off for Walden Pond to find out, before he died, whether he had ever lived, Americans have admired the individualist willing to leave society behind to discover his true self. But they have also admired him from a distance. For every lonesome cowboy, for every adventurer willing to fly solo across the Atlantic, for every monkish worshiper of solitude, most Americans, until well past the middle of the 20th century, were only too happy to find in faith, family or subdivision the security they needed to get through the insecurities of life.</p>
        <p>America may once have been the land of the free and the home of the brave, but to the social critics of the 1950's it was a community of conformists. Americans lived in lonely crowds. The organization men wore gray flannel suits. The women were stunted by the feminine mystique. The children, rebels without a cause, grew up absurd and emerged uncommitted. Ruled by a power elite, the affluent society was shaped by hidden persuaders. Americans would have been better off if they had been able to come of age in Samoa.</p>
        <p>None of this is true anymore. The institutions that once provided the security Americans craved have been transformed before their eyes. Corporations that used to offer lifetime employment now compete to lay off workers, unprotected by weakened unions. Government, once controlled by the sturdy WASP establishment, is increasingly led by conservatives, who detest government. Suburbs have merged with the cities from which they offered the promise of escape. And the family is no longer a haven; all too often a center of dysfunction, it has become one with the heartless world that surrounds it.</p>
        <p>As the opportunities to discover isolated places like Walden Pond disappear, more Americans are following Thoreau's path, looking inside themselves for the certainties their institutions no longer seem to offer. They do not need to escape from society, because society has escaped from them. America, no longer a nation of sheep, has entered the age of autonomy. People may not have a clue about how to survive on the prairie in front of an open campfire, but they are pretty much on their own when it comes to finding a mate, rearing children, choosing a career or planning retirement.</p>
        <p>On the surface, America seems as conformist as ever, its malls indistinguishable from one another, its entertainment strikingly homogenous and its coffee, though much improved, still remarkably uniform. But deep inside, Americans are exploring a new frontier. Though they still believe in God, uphold the family and love their country, they increasingly decide which God best suits their temperament; which family structure works for them; and whether their country's government is worthy of their trust.</p>
        <p>In March, The New York Times Magazine conducted a poll that asked Americans not about their party affiliations but about their beliefs, fears, anxieties, fantasies and opinions. The results of the poll demonstrate the degree to which Americans find themselves falling back on their own resources when it comes to thinking about the conditions for a good and meaningful life.</p>
        <p>The Inner God</p>
        <p>No one should ever underestimate Americans' faith in faith. Despite a widely perceived trend toward secularization, 49 percent of the respondents to the Times survey said they were about as religious as their parents; 21 percent said they were more religious. That said, Americans are not theological. Doctrinal disputes leave most people cold. Americans want a capacious God who smiles on everyone, not a jealous God protective of one particular version of his teachings.</p>
        <p>Paradoxically, Americans have a specific distaste for the theological doctrine that has informed our national morality from the beginning: Puritanism. The Puritans believed in an inherent human depravity that could be countered only by God's willingness to extend, even arbitrarily, his grace. Such Calvinistic teachings have no place in the American mind today. Americans are inveterate optimists; 75 percent believe in the intrinsic goodness of people, which suggests, whether they fully realize it or not, that they no longer subscribe to the Judeo-Christian notion of original sin. Americans are simply too nice to see Satan everywhere around them.</p>
        <p>The niceness of Americans can drive thoughtful people to distraction. Allan Bloom, the political philosopher whose life is more or less at the center of Saul Bellow's new novel, ''Ravelstein,'' believed that the willingness of his students to see good in everyone rendered them ''spiritually unclad, unconnected, isolated, with no inherited or unconditional connection with anything or anyone.'' Bloom was right to see a connection between a sunny temperament and rootlessness. When people are responsible for shaping their world, they learn that, since no one can credibly claim to have all life's answers, it pays to treat everyone with respect. But Bloom's observation also brings up the question: Would America really be better off if its citizens were meaner?</p>
        <p>After all, when we were more tightly connected by region, race and religion, our conflicts were bloodier, our words harsher, our politics more vituperative. Greater autonomy has not produced a war of all against all. If niceness is the price we have to pay for autonomy, we should consider ourselves doubly blessed.</p>
        <p>Right and Wrong</p>
        <p>Those who believe that we need a strong God fear that a people unwilling to abide by his Commandments will live in a state of moral relativism. If religious Commandments are understood to be absolutes, their concerns would be justified. Fully 60 percent of the survey's respondents said that lying is sometimes necessary to protect another person's feelings, thereby contravening the complete prohibition against lying laid down by the great Christian theologian St. Augustine and the equally great Enlightenment philosopher Immanuel Kant.</p>
        <p>Just because Americans are suspicious of moral absolutes, however, does not mean that they find no difference between right and wrong. Ninety percent of those surveyed say they believe that adults have a moral responsibility to care for their parents, and 84 percent claim that they have never cheated on their taxes, a figure likely to produce a certain amount of skepticism until we recognize that tax compliance in America is largely voluntary. That government collects enough money to function -- and that elderly people are not sent out into the cold -- is because most Americans believe in moral principles like paying one's fair share or assuming the obligation to help those who once helped you.</p>
        <p>Their Bodies, Themselves</p>
        <p>There is a moral majority in America; it just happens to be unwilling to follow anyone's party line about what morality ought to be. Attitudes about sex confirm this. The efforts of novelists, filmmakers and pharmaceutical companies notwithstanding, the poll's respondents seem clear on this point: sex is not all that interesting.</p>
        <p>Ever since the 1960's, cultural radicals have argued that political freedom leads to sexual freedom. At some level they are correct, for autonomy will be taken by many to mean that their bodies really are their own. Yet if America has become freer with its sexuality, it also remains stubbornly conventional. In America, the joys of family life outweigh the joys of sex; 63 percent of those surveyed say they believe that people who have children lead richer lives than those who do not. In their own way, conservative attitudes toward sex and marriage underscore, rather than undermine, the emergence of the age of autonomy. An autonomous people unwilling to accept God's Commandments as absolute is just as unwilling to accept the libidinous definitions of sexuality offered on television.</p>
        <p>Americans may feel that their bodies are their own, but that does not mean that they will do with their bodies whatever they want. Imagination seemed to be the domain of sexual freedom; 46 percent of the poll's respondents believe that it is O.K. to fantasize about having sex with someone other than one's partner. There is something to be said for infidelity of the mind compared with infidelity of the flesh. Not only is it less likely to be detected -- unless one is as compulsively honest as Jimmy Carter -- it also causes fewer practical complications. As such, it is the kind of pragmatic compromise that makes sense to people who respect autonomy while fearing unregulated sexuality.</p>
        <p>The Place of Work</p>
        <p>Material satisfactions may be as overrated as sexual ones. For all the talk of dot-com millionaires, Americans do not understand themselves as workaholics. If they were suddenly given three extra hours a day, most of them would spend it with their families and friends rather than at work. Money, to no one's surprise, does matter. Still, people do not attribute their achievements to the money their parents had; they also do not think that their money will be a significant determinant of who their children will turn out to be.</p>
        <p>The Times survey gives little support to the argument that Americans, frustrated by the demands of family life, have turned to the world of work for satisfaction. Time, career and financial pressures cause far more stress than one's love life or family demands. Indeed, people are more likely to get bad feelings on weekdays than on weekends. Americans value themselves primarily through who they are at home -- not what they do on the job.</p>
        <p>Public and Private</p>
        <p>Americans tend to be cynical about politicians, distrustful of institutions and civically disengaged. Yet they trust their spouses, love their children and feel good about themselves. The public and the private constitute two entirely different realms of life, one driven by suspicion, the other informed by love. The same Americans who give to charity are more likely to support welfare reform. People who disapprove of homosexuality will respond with compassion when someone they know becomes H.I.V.-positive. Let an issue be defined as a cause, and Americans, wary of the impersonal and abstract, will turn their backs. Let it be defined as a matter of friendship, family or faith, and they will act generously.</p>
        <p>In America, it is not the issue that matters. It is whether the issue is viewed as public or private. The public is what you have to do; the private is what you want to do. To make the personal the political is to sacrifice the very autonomy that makes personal life the refuge Americans believe it has become. Public and private in America are mirror images of each other.</p>
        <p>Inner Differences</p>
        <p>Because Americans are increasingly on their own when it comes to finding the right way to live, autonomy means different things to different people. Black Americans, the survey demonstrates, show less confidence that they can be anything they want to be, are more likely than whites to conclude that those who get to the top of American society are less moral than others and are more inclined than whites to believe that race played a big role in making them who they are. As with race, so with class. The wealthiest and most educated of the respondents find less fault with unequal income distribution than the poorer and least educated. It helps to feel good about the world when the world has been good to you.</p>
        <p>Women and men may not be from different planets, but they do see the world differently. Women are more likely than men to think that cheating on taxes is wrong, that taking care of elderly parents is right and that there is something morally problematic about income inequality. Thus, to the degree that there is a moral gap in America, it can also be described as a gender gap.</p>
        <p>Some of the most significant differences appear among Americans over questions that tap into their inner-most feelings. On matters related to sex, for example, America has a genuine two-party system: one group of Americans thinks it is wrong to fantasize about having sex with someone besides your partner, while another group does not. What differentiates these groups is not religion but religiosity. On nearly all the questions asked by the Times survey, no appreciable differences existed between Catholics and Protestants. Yet major differences did exist between people who described themselves as frequent church attendees and those who did not. It is whether you believe, not what you believe, that counts. And even whether you believe does not count as much as we sometimes think, for both churchgoing and non-churchgoing Americans agree that people are inherently good.</p>
        <p>The Risks of Autonomy</p>
        <p>America is a harder country to govern in an age of autonomy. Its inhabitants are increasingly unwilling to do things just because someone in authority tells them they should. Everyone seems to have an opinion on truths that were once considered self-evident. The resulting turbulence is often too much for those who worry that Americans, preoccupied with their own selfish concerns, do not worry enough. Looking back to the days of ''Saving Private Ryan,'' they fear that, especially during this golden age of prosperity, people are paying too little attention to the poverty around them or to the responsibilities the country must exercise toward the world. Only when we face such catastrophes as depression and war, the argument goes, do we seem capable of keeping our narcissistic inclinations in check, as if worthy public lives were dependent on tragic private ones.</p>
        <p>But there are clear reasons why society is better off when people value inner autonomy. One is that autonomy is a good thing in itself. Of those surveyed, 90 percent say that being an American is a big part of who they are. That may well be because being an American enables them to discover who they are. People in Puritan America or Victorian England were instructed in the proper way to live, often by those who could not live by the rules they designed for others. Compared with those eras, the age of autonomy is worth celebrating for the sense of freedom it offers.</p>
        <p>The age of autonomy should be embraced for another reason: its optimistic theory of human nature makes more sense than the one it replaced. Earlier worldviews in America argued that a strong God, like a strong state, was necessary to keep weak people in line. But Americans see themselves as capable of making their way in the world without firm guidance from their moral superiors. There is no reason to believe that both spiritual and public life are improved when human beings are assumed to be depraved.</p>
        <p>People committed to a sunny view of human nature are unlikely to appreciate the tragic themes of their literature, but nor are they likely to support leaders who prey on the insecurities of others. If the results of the Times survey are any indication, the age of autonomy is not an age of anarchy. Americans are not out to destroy the institutions and practices that make it possible for them to live together in relative peace. Rather, they are engaged in a process of rethinking what properly ought to be the concern of others and what properly belongs to themselves.</p>
        <p>When Thoreau wrote ''Walden,'' America was an overwhelmingly Christian society in which morality was public while work and family were private. Today, people choose their religions and shape their moralities even as they can no longer shield their incomes, family sizes or consumer preferences (if they shop on the Internet) from inquisitive eyes. The less privacy we have over the things that matter relatively little, the more privacy we crave over the things that matter most.</p>
        <p>Living in an age of autonomy is bound to cause frustration because the things that matter most ought to matter to us all. Americans seem to recognize this; 61 percent think that America was a better place when people had stronger attachments and did not move around so much. But if Americans did not ask their institutions to crumble all around them, they seem to have gotten used to living less confined lives. That may be why the social critics of today are presenting a message that is quite different from the one offered by their predecessors a half-century ago. When we bowl, we bowl alone -- and not in crowds. Kids grow up more ambitious than absurd. Overworked and overspent, we dare our organizations and our not-so-hidden persuaders to keep up with our changing tastes.</p>
        <p>The age of autonomy, like the age of conformity, must have its critics. Autonomy does raise the prospect of people too preoccupied with their private selves to care much about the common good. But it also challenges those who emphasize the importance of the common good to take heed of what Americans find valuable about their way of life. The question is whether Americans can learn to use the autonomy they have gained to strengthen the institutions that make civil society possible. If they do not, this new age promises to be unstable. But if they do, it will produce institutions from which people will feel less need to escape -- in large measure because institutions will not escape from them.</p>
