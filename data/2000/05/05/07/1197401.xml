      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>MUCH like a mirage, the too-good-to-be-true Bridges in Bridgehampton is in the process of revving up for its first summer. It is an airy, spacious place of majestic arches, massive beams, graceful chandeliers, a wall of French doors, tiny candles and glorious music. It serves healthy portions of both robust and refined dishes at very unHamptons prices. With a three-course $19.95 fixed price dinner, the Island's only Sunday gospel brunch (a drink, entree and dessert affair) for $24.95, soups and desserts for $5 and entrees as low as $16, Bridges is nearly every diner's dream: it looks expensive, but isn't. There are few local restaurants this sophisticated and attractive, especially in the Hamptons, that offer comparable value.</p>
        <p>Bridges, at 964 Bridgehampton-Sag Harbor Turnpike (631-537-9105), opened quietly last fall in a roadhouse that was best known for its bar scene, drinking and dancing. The live music remains (gospel singers from Southampton and Riverhead churches at Sunday brunches and jazz trios and quartets at all other times). But Bridges' owners and a husband and wife team who are chef and hostess, respectively,are putting the restaurant on the culinary, as well as the cabaret, map.</p>

        <p>MUCH like a mirage, the too-good-to-be-true Bridges in Bridgehampton is in the process of revving up for its first summer. It is an airy, spacious place of majestic arches, massive beams, graceful chandeliers, a wall of French doors, tiny candles and glorious music. It serves healthy portions of both robust and refined dishes at very unHamptons prices. With a three-course $19.95 fixed price dinner, the Island's only Sunday gospel brunch (a drink, entree and dessert affair) for $24.95, soups and desserts for $5 and entrees as low as $16, Bridges is nearly every diner's dream: it looks expensive, but isn't. There are few local restaurants this sophisticated and attractive, especially in the Hamptons, that offer comparable value.</p>
        <p>Bridges, at 964 Bridgehampton-Sag Harbor Turnpike (631-537-9105), opened quietly last fall in a roadhouse that was best known for its bar scene, drinking and dancing. The live music remains (gospel singers from Southampton and Riverhead churches at Sunday brunches and jazz trios and quartets at all other times). But Bridges' owners and a husband and wife team who are chef and hostess, respectively,are putting the restaurant on the culinary, as well as the cabaret, map.</p>
        <p>By day, sunlight floods through the multipaned windows that rim the ceiling, and brunch patrons drink Bloody Marys, mimosas and wine while they devour boldly flavored Cajun and soul food favorites like Southern fried chicken, blackened fish with Cajun rice, smoked ham with a bourbon glaze and collard greens. All of which begins with high, fluffy-light squares of banana bread, flecked with chocolate, and pumpkin spice bread (both baked by the hostess who is also the pastry chef) and ends with a rousing hand-clapping gospel number that unites patrons and performers on the dance floor.</p>
        <p>At night, Bridges's bountiful bouquets and spiffy blue and white napery is bathed in subdued light, its blue globe droplights cast a glow in the bar area, cool jazz fills the air and the menu turns inventive and eclectic: tomato-fennel soup, spanakopita, five spice trout with Asian noodles, pecan and Macadamia nut pie.</p>
        <p>At both meals, there is a sense of style and taste. A sliver of fresh ginger, atop a carved cucumber, accompanies fish dishes, those collard greens are fresh not canned, a puff of whipped cream and occasionally some unannounced ice cream escorts desserts, the asparagus in the omelet is white. That elan is evident in the room's alternating purple and white curtains, silver latticed chairs, antique breakfront and motion picture photos of Humphrey Bogart, Betty Davis and Lauren Bacall.</p>
        <p>The gospel brunch boasts portions that make dinner impossible and an hour's worth of sometimes joyous, sometimes plaintive singing that starts at 2 p.m. (the number of performers varies from just a few to a full choir.)</p>
        <p>The three brunch entrees sampled -- Southern fried chicken with a crisp greaseless coating and juicy meat; a moist, vibrantly seasoned slab of blackened salmon and tender Lundy smoked ham, sporting a slightly sweet bourbon glaze and sprinkled with peppercorns -- were presented with oniony, golden potato pancakes, soft, rich sweet potatoes, tasteless, uninspiring Cajun rice and collard greens.</p>
        <p>The dessert star of the day was a large, elegantly light portion of bread pudding in a puddle of sweet cream. A rustic, nutty apple crumb pie and the dense pecan-macadamia pie also drew praise. All three, along with the likes of Cuban-inspired rum-coconut flan, homey fruit pies, an intense concentrated triple chocolate ganache, a decadent brownie a la mode concoction, a smooth, light ricotta cream cake and ice creams from Fletcher's of Southampton (try the vanilla and cinnamon) are at times available at dinner as well.</p>
        <p>Speaking of dinner, if that $19.95, three-course affair is available, grab it. It's served on Thursday and Friday evenings, will be featured every night from 5 to 6:30 during the season and offers a la carte selections rather than the less expensive choices often found on fixed-pricee meals (though there will be no significant financial after shock if you want to be a big shot and order from the regular menu.)</p>
        <p>Not everyone at our table loved the assertive, garlic-laden complimentary tapenade, with its olives, anchovies, Cognac and capers, but its taste kick serves notice that the kitchen strives for full-flavored fare. Most of the time it is achieved. Starters included that feathery light spanokopita, or spinach pie ($7), a standard green salad ($5) and endive salad ($7) with a harmonious blend of beets, olives, tangerine, toasted pecans and citrus vinaigrette flavors.  Only a too salty tomato-fennel soup ($5) with no discernible fennel flavor fell short.</p>
        <p>Among the noteworthy main courses sampled was a rare sushi-like filet of tuna in a spicy Sichuan peanut sauce, fork-tender chicken scaloppine alive with shiitake mushrooms and shallots in a Dijon Marsala demi-glace, sauteed five-spice trout over soba noodles infused with red, yellow and green peppers, and a muscular penne pasta of the day that featured a spirited, pulpy eggplant, goat cheese and tomato sauce. Those sweet potatoes along with their equally good mashed cousins and springy, refreshing asparagus accompanied most dishes.</p>
        <p>Two postscripts: the down-to-earth, personable owners, hostess and staff at Bridges are a pleasure, and the restaurant seems to be attracting more than its share of performers. One night, a visiting opera diva from Philadelphia got up from her table and contributed a few songs while on another a pianist and a vocalist went on stage when the jazz musicians didn't show.</p>
        <p>Openings</p>
        <p>A Tarantella Due will open at 274 Glen Street in Glen Cove (516-671-9323) as soon as its liquor license is issued. The Mario Silvestri family, who own A Tarantella in Brooklyn, purchased DiMaggio's Ristorante and are already on the scene. The family's mother and son chef team and the former DiMaggio's kitchen crew have created a moderately priced menu that stresses home-style Neapolitan dishes.</p>
        <p>Closings</p>
        <p>Stephanie's Bistro, 2548 Nesconset Highway, Stony Brook. A Chinese buffet is to replace Stephanie's.</p>
