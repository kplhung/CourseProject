        <p>This summer visitors will be able to hear about the Gilded Age as well as see its  Newport, R.I., setting. The Preservation Society of Newport County is offering new guided and audio tours. The Victorian Cottages Walking Tour of Bellevue Avenue is a three-hour guided program providing an  architectural as well as social history of the town's most illustrious street from Kingscote to Chateau-sur-Mer. Kingscote was the first ''summer cottage'' built along what was then a dirt road in 1839. Chateau-sur-Mer, designed by a local architect, Seth Bradford, was built in 1852 and renovated  by Richard Morris Hunt in 1872. Tours of both of these landmarks will be included.  Walking tours will run from Memorial Day weekend to Columbus Day starting daily at 10 a.m. at the Preservation Society's offices at 424 Bellevue Avenue; $25, $9 ages 6 to 17.</p>
        <p>Also new this year is a self-guided audio tour, Sights and Sounds of the Gilded Age: Life at The Elms, focusing on the coal magnate Edward Julius Berwind's Bellevue Avenue estate. Built at the turn of the century by the Philadelphia architect Horace Trumbauer, The Elms -- a National Historic Landmark -- is considered to be a faithful interpretation of the Chateau d'Asnieres  near Paris. The tour includes the voices of curators and historians, former house guests and family members of the Berwinds and their employees. The Elms is open daily year round 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. The audio tour, which replaces the guided tour, costs $9, $4 ages 6 to 17. A guided tour of the work areas (from laundry to boiler room) is available, for $12, $4 ages 6 to 17.</p>
