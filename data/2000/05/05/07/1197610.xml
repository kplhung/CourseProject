        <p>Sex. Drugs. Suicide. Divorce. Alcoholism. Gun Violence. Are these topics relevant to teenagers? Of course, they are -- always have been, always will be.</p>

        <p>Sex. Drugs. Suicide. Divorce. Alcoholism. Gun Violence. Are these topics relevant to teenagers? Of course, they are -- always have been, always will be.</p>
        <p>Does it follow that such topics should be splashed all over the television shows that teenagers -- and younger children -- watch? Yes, some say: the shows should reflect reality. No, others respond: it inundates children, too young, with situations they're not yet emotionally ready for.</p>
        <p>Ready or not, though, Ozzie-and-Harriet-land has long since given way to stark dramas on teenage issues. A pivotal show was ''Beverly Hills 90210,'' which was born 10 years ago and went on to deal with everything from racism to condoms to school violence. And though not as big a hit, ''Party of Five,'' arriving several years later, was also in this tradition.</p>
        <p>So it is something of a milestone that these shows, both from Fox, end this month. To a young audience obsessed with youth, the shows -- and their stars -- were simply too old.</p>
        <p>Does that mean Dobie Gillis will rush back to fill the void? Not a chance. The lineup is chock full of ''90210'' wannabes and their descendants, like ''Dawson's Creek,'' ''Felicity'' and ''Popular,'' all frantically tackling every teenage subject imaginable.</p>
        <p>Realism has its limits, though; nearly every character is still absurdly gorgeous.</p>
