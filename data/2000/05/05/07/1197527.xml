        <p>Woodwinds and strings reigned at this year's scholarship competition sponsored by the Music Teachers Council of Westchester. Judging for the contest, geared to accomplished high school seniors aspiring to professional careers in music, took place last Sunday in the White Plains studio of Robert Canfield, a pianist and longtime council member.</p>
        <p>Melody Chan, a violinist from Scarsdale, won the $1,500 main prize, joining past winners like William Wolfram, the concert pianist;  Mindy Kaufman, the New York Philharmonic flutist; and David Eggar, the cellist-pianist-composer who went on to play his winning cello concerto in Ronald Reagan's White House.</p>
        <p>Other winners were Yona Stamatis of Lake Mohegan, violinist, and Aimee Morin of Scarsdale, flutist, who will each receive $1,000; and Ari Perelman of Katonah, trombonist, and Ruth Dyckman of Cortlandt Manor, oboist and English horn player, who  each won $500. The winners will perform in a free recital at the White Plains Public Library (date to be determined).</p>
        <p>The continuing purpose of the 60-year-old council, however, is not so much ferreting out tomorrow's superstars as providing an informal institute for its 48 members, many of whom have performed widely. The teacher's lot can be a lonely one, they say, and the chance to meet regularly with their colleagues in turn enriches their students.</p>
        <p>Lectures, visits from composers, breakfast seminars and home-based recitals keep the group active. Judith Gutmann of Larchmont recalled one lecture by a child psychiatrist who was himself an amateur clarinetist.</p>
        <p>''He talked about motivating young children and using whatever would get their attention,'' she said. ''After that, I started using jazz. Listening to him opened up my horizons to a whole new form of music.''</p>
        <p>Rome Theater Gets a Second Life</p>
        <p>''Give me your tired -- your huddled masses yearning to be free of the multiplexes and their insipid films.'' A fitting inscription, said Mayor John M. Nonna of Pleasantville for the Jacob Burns Film Center, a regional center for independent, foreign, documentary and art films, which will be housed in the former Rome Theater in Pleasantville.</p>
        <p>Plans to renovate and expand the Rome, which is now an office building, include a 275-seat main theater and a smaller 145-seat theater, as well as a 70-seat screening room, art gallery, library and cafe.</p>
        <p>The first major gift for the $6.5 million project was $1.5 million  from the Pleasantville-based Jacob Burns Foundation, a family foundation begun in 1959 by the late philanthropist and lawyer. A $5 million fund-raising campaign is planned for the center, which is expected to open early next year. The Film Society of Lincoln Center will collaborate on programming, in one of its first off-campus ventures.</p>
        <p>The 62-year-old Rome, once a flourishing movie house, was closed in 1987 as multiplexes flooded the market, and the Spanish-style building -- its distinctive facade intact -- was converted to commercial office space. In 1998 the Friends of the Rome Theater bought the building as a place for directors, screenwriters, cinematographers and actors to converge and present their work to the public. Among those on the group's advisory board are Robert Altman, Richard Gere (at left), Mary Beth Hurt, Liam Neeson, Susan Sarandon, Stanley Tucci and Vanessa Williams.</p>
        <p>Awards for Dance Graduates</p>
        <p>If dance sometimes seems to get short shrift among the arts, Carol Walker has a theory why. ''Dance is the most ephemeral art form,'' Ms. Walker, dean of the Conservatory of Dance at Purchase College, said. ''You see it, and then you don't.'' She went on: ''There is notation, which is relatively new, but dances are recreated primarily by being handed down, from artist to artist. That's why so much has been lost.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Walker has reason to be satisfied these days, however, as the conservatory prepares the 160 students in its 25th graduating class for commencement. Two dance seniors, Jennifer Goggans and Kyle Abraham, recently won the universitywide Chancellors' Award for Student Excellence, along with Michael Maurey of the social science division. (A campus is lucky to receive  even one award, Ms. Walker said.) Moreover, Ms. Goggans will join the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, while Mr. Abraham, who also received the New York State Thayer Fellowship in the Arts, will perform with various modern dance companies.</p>
        <p>''It's terribly exciting for us,'' Ms. Walker said. ''If they've developed to the point where the rest of the world can see their talent, we've done something right.'' Half of those entering as freshmen graduate as dancers, and 80 percent of them go on to dance professionally, she said. The winnowing process goes on all along, but sometimes talent ''blossoms before your eyes.''</p>
