        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am the mother of two school-age children who lives in Larchmont and am outraged about the article about moms driving S.U.V.'s.</p>
        <p>I am deeply disturbed at the arrogance of the moms quoted who seemed to be more concerned about their image, being chic, having power and getting respect by driving these vehicles. Yes, the mention of safety was an issue but only where it concerned themselves. One woman alluded to the fact that her ''mistakes'' will be less noticed. Mistakes? This attitude frightens me because I feel these vehicles are a danger to others in the hands of not so capable or inexperienced drivers.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am the mother of two school-age children who lives in Larchmont and am outraged about the article about moms driving S.U.V.'s.</p>
        <p>I am deeply disturbed at the arrogance of the moms quoted who seemed to be more concerned about their image, being chic, having power and getting respect by driving these vehicles. Yes, the mention of safety was an issue but only where it concerned themselves. One woman alluded to the fact that her ''mistakes'' will be less noticed. Mistakes? This attitude frightens me because I feel these vehicles are a danger to others in the hands of not so capable or inexperienced drivers.</p>
        <p>I have witnessed firsthand the recklessness and carelessness of drivers of those vehicles around our local school and surrounding parking areas. Many drivers are in a hurry, on the phone, racing from one place to another. On one occasion, my husband and I witnessed two young girls crossing at a traffic light in front of their moms when an S.U.V. driver failed to notice them and nearly ran them over.</p>
        <p>The article also mentioned that some nannies were being given access to these vehicles. How capable are they? Some of these helpers are often being newly trained in driving.  This is a scary thought when inexperienced drivers are given the keys to these monster vehicles.</p>
