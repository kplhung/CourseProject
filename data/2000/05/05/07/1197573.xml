        <p>AT 4:30 a.m. on a winter Saturday, I came to understand the value of a Ford Explorer Sport Trac.</p>
        <p>Around 1:30 that morning, two buddies and I decided to drive here from Boston -- the kind of misguided but enthusiastic idea that college students generate in the middle of the night.</p>
        <p>Three hours and three turnpikes later, I considered myself lucky to be driving a 2001 Sport Trac, possibly the only vehicle that could keep us excited about our dawn excursion as we plowed through four feet of snow along Maine's back roads. Until then, the Sport Trac didn't seem to make a whole lot of sense. With its pickup-truck frame, carlike interior and four feet of big-enough-for-your-bikes-and-not-much-else cargo space, this Explorer derivative is more likely to make you say ''What the heck?'' than ''How useful!''</p>
        <p>Ford's new car-truck-S.U.V. may seem like the biggest compromise since the bicameral legislature, but for buyers who can't be pigeon-holed into a particular lifestyle, the Sport Trac, which went on sale early this year, may be a pleasant surprise.</p>
        <p>Take our trip, for example: In Boston's parking lots and side streets, I wouldn't have wanted a giant sport utility. Amid the maniacal 2 a.m. drivers on the Massachusetts and New Hampshire turnpikes, I wanted something with more authority than a car or station wagon. And on icy, winding rural highways, I wouldn't have wanted a light pickup.</p>
        <p>In addition to handling the challenges our impromptu road trip posed, the Sport Trac simply appealed to some aspect of our disposition -- we are easily seduced by advertising -- as a great choice for fast-paced, unorthodox travel.</p>
        <p>For daily living, the Sport Trac works just as well. With a frame 40 percent stiffer than the Explorer's, larger brake rotors and a specially tuned suspension, it actually rides more comfortably than its sister model with an enclosed cargo area.</p>
        <p>Although Ford is marketing the Sport Trac as a sport utility, anybody who sees it is going to call it a truck -- a less trendy but more accurate label. And with rear leaf springs and typically truckish rear-end lightness, it feels like a truck. (In fact, after the four-door Explorer is redesigned for the 2001 model year, the Sport Trac will have more in common with the Ranger pickup.)</p>
        <p>Drivers won't have many gripes about performance; the chief complaint is likely to be the lack of a V-8. The switch-operated four-wheel drive (worth the extra $3,000 over the 4-by-2 model) provides outstanding traction in all conditions. And the engine (a 4-liter V-6 with 205 horsepower and 240 foot-pounds of torque) produces competent acceleration and enough low-end pull to handle heavy cargo.</p>
        <p>On the issue of cargo, the bed could be described as either problematic (in the sense that it simply doesn't have much room) or innovative (made of dentproof, rustproof composite plastic). The nearly square cargo box measures 50 by 41 inches on the inside, which will handle a Jet Ski or a washing machine, but is not big enough for a sofa or the archetypal sheet of plywood. The plastic bed is a great convenience when you consider that most other trucks have painted steel beds that stay unblemished only if they wear after-market plastic liners.</p>
        <p>In addition, many buyers will opt for the supplemental cargo cage, which attaches to the opened tailgate and adds a couple extra feet of length. A hard, locking tonneau cover, which fits over the bed, is an option.</p>
        <p>And with just an ounce or two of creativity, owners who haul stuff frequently might realize that the Sport Trac may actually be a better choice than a regular pickup.</p>
        <p>Take my needs, for example. As a drummer who moves musical equipment from gig to gig, I can toss heavy-duty gear like drums and amplifiers in the bed and store more fragile stuff in the spacious back seat.</p>
        <p>That seat is a blessing in and of itself. If you see the Sport Trac as a sport utility, the 60-40 split bench really isn't interesting or surprising. But if you see it as a truck -- and it is a truck -- the rear seat is a welcome change with its ample space (there is more than 3 feet of legroom), adjustable headrests and standard power windows. And if two people ride in back, each gets his or her own door.</p>
        <p>The interior design is modern, though the black numbers on white dials of the instrument cluster may not be to everyone's taste. Notable features include Berber floor mats over a rubber floor covering (which can be cleaned almost effortlessly with a wet rag) and titanium accents on the door handles.</p>
        <p>A cute interior bonus is a soft pack on the console that doubles as a removable sport bag. You can fit Power Bars, bottled water and motivational tapes in there or in the two hidden storage bins behind the rear seat.</p>
        <p>What you won't be able to fit in the Sport Trac are many young buyers. With sticker prices close to $30,000 (the test truck was $28,205), the possibility of owning this vehicle will seem as distant as retirement to all but the most blue-blooded 20-somethings.</p>
        <p>Perhaps this isn't Ford's target market, but the company does pitch the car as a dream-come-true for people with ''active lifestyles.'' Whatever that means, Ford's pricing may keep the Sport Trac out of the hands of recent college graduates looking for primary vehicles.</p>
        <p>Still, buyers get a lot for their money. The Sport Trac has loads of standard goodies (CD player, power everything, neat interior) for those who can afford it.</p>
        <p>And, as a final bonus, it just might inspire you to load up your Funkadelic CD's and take an early-morning road trip.</p>
        <p>INSIDE TRACK: New DNA in the automotive gene pool.</p>
