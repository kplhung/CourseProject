        <p>RIDLEY SCOTT'S $107 million epic ''Gladiator,'' now splashed across movie screens nationwide, is the latest and most opulent contribution to the sword-and-sandal genre. When the film opened last week, the timing was uncanny: Steve Reeves, best known for playing Hercules and other beefcake roles in Italian gladiator flicks in the 1950's and 60's, had died just days before. And starting tonight, NBC is rolling out a two-part production of ''Jason and the Argonauts.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps it's because the producers were not up to the lofty subject matter -- and in some cases maybe it's just the bad dubbing -- but the earlier sword-and-sandal epics often had a unique way of yielding, well, memorable utterances. It didn't matter whether the plots were derived from the Bible, Greek mythology, tales of ancient Rome -- or, more typically, some unholy mixture of the three. The dialogue frequently managed to range from the ponderous to the purple, and sometimes to the plain preposterous.</p>

        <p>RIDLEY SCOTT'S $107 million epic ''Gladiator,'' now splashed across movie screens nationwide, is the latest and most opulent contribution to the sword-and-sandal genre. When the film opened last week, the timing was uncanny: Steve Reeves, best known for playing Hercules and other beefcake roles in Italian gladiator flicks in the 1950's and 60's, had died just days before. And starting tonight, NBC is rolling out a two-part production of ''Jason and the Argonauts.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps it's because the producers were not up to the lofty subject matter -- and in some cases maybe it's just the bad dubbing -- but the earlier sword-and-sandal epics often had a unique way of yielding, well, memorable utterances. It didn't matter whether the plots were derived from the Bible, Greek mythology, tales of ancient Rome -- or, more typically, some unholy mixture of the three. The dialogue frequently managed to range from the ponderous to the purple, and sometimes to the plain preposterous.</p>
        <p>Still, these immortal phrases plumb the great themes of the human condition. Some classic -- if not exactly classical -- examples follow.</p>
        <p>THOMAS VINCIGUERRA</p>
        <p>Valor</p>
        <p>I don't need that spear. It's only a very young lion.</p>
        <p>-- Samson (Victor Mature) in ''Samson and Delilah'' (MCMXLIX)</p>
        <p>Every man has sworn to die well if he has to -- to die with style!</p>
        <p>-- Strabo (Ernest Borgnine) in ''Demetrius and the Gladiators'' (MCMLIV)</p>
        <p>You Roman generals become gods so quickly -- a few victories, a few massacres.</p>
        <p>-- Cleopatra (Elizabeth Taylor) in ''Cleopatra'' (MCMLXIII)</p>
        <p>Mind and Body</p>
        <p>A gladiator is like a stallion. You'll be pampered. You'll be oiled, bathed, shaved, massaged, taught to use your head. A good body with a dull brain is as cheap as life itself.</p>
        <p>-- Lentulus Batiatus (Peter Ustinov) in ''Spartacus'' (MCMLX)</p>
        <p>Messalina (Susan Hayward): Strabo, when you were fighting in the arena, what did you think about the night before?</p>
        <p>Strabo: It doesn't pay a gladiator to think, my lady.</p>
        <p>-- ''Demetrius and the Gladiators''</p>
        <p>Here at Padua, we expect more than simple butchery -- and we get it.</p>
        <p>-- Marcellus (Charles McGraw), head of the gladiator academy in ''Spartacus''</p>
        <p>Go ahead -- prove it to me. Show me that you haven't got muscles in your head as well.</p>
        <p>-- A rival of Hercules (Steve Reeves) before a discus toss in ''Hercules'' (MCMLIX)</p>
        <p>You and I have a tendency toward corpulence. Corpulence makes a man reasonable, pleasant and phlegmatic. Have you noticed that the nastiest of tyrants are invariably thin?</p>
        <p>-- Sempronius Gracchus (Charles Laughton) in ''Spartacus''</p>
        <p>Guard: May Morpheus give you deep slumber.</p>
        <p>Popppaea (Claudette Colbert): Thank you, but I'd rather have exciting dreams.</p>
        <p>-- ''The Sign of the Cross'' (MCMXXXII)</p>
        <p>I'm so sleepy I can't seem to stay awake!</p>
        <p>-- Hercules (Reeves) in ''Hercules Unchained'' (MCMLX)</p>
        <p>Women</p>
        <p>Demetrius (Victor Mature): Jesus said, ''Love ye one another as brothers.''</p>
        <p>Messalina: Tell me, how do you manage to love a woman as a brother?</p>
        <p>Demetrius: You don't.</p>
        <p>-- ''Demetrius and the Gladiators''</p>
        <p>Princess: What are you looking at?</p>
        <p>Hercules: I was looking at you. It's very difficult to find a girl as beautiful as you are.</p>
        <p>Princess: Oh, you say it so simply, as though you were speaking of a plant or an animal. I almost think you are sincere.</p>
        <p>-- ''Hercules''</p>
        <p>All other women are like the second pressing of the grape.</p>
        <p>-- Temujin (John Wayne) in ''The Conquerer'' (MCMLVI)</p>
        <p>My breasts are full of love and life. My hips are round and well apart. Such women, they say, have sons.</p>
        <p>-- Cleopatra in ''Cleopatra''</p>
        <p>Dear Poppaea, one woman should never judge another. She hasn't the glands for it.</p>
        <p>-- Nero (Peter Ustinov) in ''Quo Vadis'' (MCMLI)</p>
        <p>Messalina: Is there nothing human in your religion?</p>
        <p>Demetrius: Well, there's no commandment that says a woman can't talk like a fool.</p>
        <p>Messalina: Be careful, Demetrius. My claws can be sharper than the tiger's!</p>
        <p>-- ''Demetrius and the Gladiators''</p>
        <p>Eros</p>
        <p>Hercules (suffering from amnesia): Anyway, I like the idea of being a king. By the way -- what's my name?</p>
        <p>Omphale (Sylvia Lopez): What difference does it make?</p>
        <p>Hercules: Nothing. It's just, if you called me--</p>
        <p>Omphale: To me, your name is love.</p>
        <p>Hercules: Ha-ha! I'm beginning to like this place!</p>
        <p>-- ''Hercules Unchained''</p>
        <p>Drusilla (Teresa Ann Savoy): I thought you didn't like virgins.</p>
        <p>Caligula (Malcolm McDowell): I've never known any!</p>
        <p>-- ''Caligula'' (MCMLXXX)</p>
        <p>Samson: The oldest trick in the world. Silk trap, baited with a woman.</p>
        <p>Delilah (Hedy Lamarr): You know a better bait, Samson? Men always respond.</p>
        <p>-- ''Samson and Delilah''</p>
        <p>He was not captured by force of arms, but by their softness.</p>
        <p>-- Saran of Gaza (George Sanders) in ''Samson and Delilah''</p>
        <p>You should attack my guards more often. Battle seems to become you.</p>
        <p>-- Julius Caesar (Rex Harrison) to Cleopatra in ''Cleopatra''</p>
        <p>Marriage</p>
        <p>Women are a nuisance. At first you suffer because you want a wife. Then you suffer because you're jealous. And when your jealousy is past you end up suffering because she bosses you around.</p>
        <p>-- Ulysses (Gabriele Antonini) in ''Hercules''</p>
        <p>Hercules, that ceremony you went through -- the bonds of matrimony. Now you're married. So drive carefully!</p>
        <p>-- Ulysses in ''Hercules Unchained''</p>
        <p>One wife? One God, that I can understand -- but one wife? That is not civilized. It is not generous.</p>
        <p>-- Sheikh Ilderim (Hugh Griffith) in ''Ben-Hur'' (MCMLIX)</p>
        <p>Faith</p>
        <p>Your tricks won't work on me because I know them! Tell that to Jesus the next time you see Him!</p>
        <p>-- Demetrius in ''Demetrius and the Gladiators''</p>
        <p>If I was to punish every blasphemy, I would have no followers.</p>
        <p>-- Zeus (Niall MacGinnis) in ''Jason and the Argonauts (MCMLXIII)</p>
        <p>Demetrius: Get it from her!</p>
        <p>The apostle Peter (Michael Rennie): How?</p>
        <p>Demetrius: How should I know? One of your miracles!</p>
        <p>-- ''Demetrius and the Gladiators''</p>
        <p>Death</p>
        <p>Petronius? Dead? By his own hand? I don't believe it. I shall never forgive him for this.  Never. Without my permission? It's rebellion!  It's blasphemy!</p>
        <p>-- Nero in ''Quo Vadis''</p>
        <p>You're almost dead! What's it like?</p>
        <p>-- Caligula to Nerva (John Gielgud), who has opened his veins, in ''Caligula''</p>
        <p>You know, it's quite possible, Octavian, that when you die, you will die without ever having been alive.</p>
        <p>-- Marc Antony (Richard Burton) in ''Cleopatra''</p>
        <p>Eternal Truths</p>
        <p>The worst sort of life is better than the best kind of death.</p>
        <p>-- Glydon (William Marshall) in ''Demetrius and the Gladiators''</p>
        <p>When the truth is ugly, only a lie can be beautiful.</p>
        <p>-- Messalina in ''Demetrius and the Gladiators''</p>
        <p>Marc Antony: Queens, queens. Strip them naked as any other woman, they are no longer queens.</p>
        <p>Rufio (Martin Landau): It is also difficult to tell the rank of a naked general.</p>
        <p>-- ''Cleopatra''</p>
