        <p>It's not all that cold in southern Iceland, despite the name. Especially in the capital, Reykjavik, which even in winter rarely goes below freezing, thanks to the Gulf Stream. But head north just a little, to the suburb of Kopavogur, and it's a different story. Here you need arctic clothing for much of the year.</p>
        <p>But chess-mad Icelanders are not easily deterred. The citizens of this nobly stark country held another in their long series of prominent chess tournaments in early April.</p>
        <p>This was a quick-play (all moves in 25 minutes) grandmaster event.  The favorite, Garry Kasparov, won,  defeating Viswanathan Anand in the final after two regulation draws.  Kasparov won a two-game tie break by winning both five-minute games.</p>
        <p>But that was not enough for the Kopavagurs. They organized a simultaneous exhibition at the Langjokull Glacier for Kasparov against 10 opponents. Below freezing or not, with chess tables made of ice, Kasparov mowed them all down quickly. Probably to get out of the cold.</p>
        <p>Kasparov has accepted Vladimir Kramnik of Russia as challenger for a 16-game world championship match to be held probably in London Oct. 9 to Nov. 9. A new group, Braingames Network, has raised a $2 million prize fund.</p>
        <p>Here is the decisive second tie-break game with Anand.</p>
        <p>The move 5 . . . a6 introduces the Najdorf Variation of the Sicilian Defense. Like Bobby Fischer, Kasparov almost never plays anything else. It takes enormous tactical virtuosity, but those two world champions obviously felt it was positionally ideal, if its turns and twists could only be mastered.</p>
        <p>In their first quick-play game, Anand had played 8 g4, and after 8 . . . Nfd7 9 Qd2 Nb6 10 a4 ba 11 Na4 Na4 12 Ra4 Be7 13 Be2 O-O 14 O-O Bb7 15 Rfa1 Nd7 16 Nb3! (not 16 Ba6? Nc5), he had developed powerful pressure against the black queenside.</p>
        <p>One can only guess why he did not repeat this move order. Perhaps he had foreseen 10 . . . Nc4. If so, he does not show anything wonderful about how to deal with this move now.</p>
        <p>Another nagging question here: Why did Kasparov play his favorite, heavily analyzed defense, so weakly? One can only conclude that even the greatest player of our day is not infallible.</p>
        <p>The result of 10 . . . Nc4 11 Bc4 bc was to give Kasparov the bishop pair and to prevent Anand from finding any useful targets on the queenside.</p>
        <p>After 19 . . . e5, Anand should have retreated with 20 Nf3 or 20 Nde2 and been content to retain attacking chances. Instead he went full tilt by sacrificing a knight with 20 Ne6?</p>
        <p>But there was no way to intimidate Kasparov. He cold-bloodedly took his king away from danger with 21 . . . Kd8. After 22 f6 Qc6 23 Rd2 Kc7, safety was at hand.</p>
        <p>After 24 g6, Anand had to recover a piece, but following 24 . . . Rg8 25 g7 Bg7 26 Qf7 Qd7 27 Qd7 Nd7 28 fg7 Rg7 29 Kf2 d5, he was in terrible trouble.</p>
        <p>Anand gave up. After 30 Bh6 Rg6 31 Be3 d4 32 Bd4 Rg2 33 Ke3 Rd2 34 Be5 Ne5 35 Kd2 Rh8, he would be a piece down.</p>
