        <p>Naomi Stern letter warns fellow travelers not to visit remote peoples in places like Ethiopia and Namibia because begging for foreign money only destroys local culture and bartering system</p>

        <p>To the Editor: Please, please don't visit the Himba! Two years ago, I visited remote tribes in Ethiopia,  and have felt terrible about it ever since.</p>
        <p>Group guilt was what I felt when we hit the first Tsamai village and were deluged by people asking for money. Ostensibly they are asking you to take their picture, for which you then pay them. But ''photo'' really means ''money,'' because they  approach you with their hands out, whether you have a camera or not. Surely they learned this from tourists.</p>

        <p>To the Editor: Please, please don't visit the Himba! Two years ago, I visited remote tribes in Ethiopia,  and have felt terrible about it ever since.</p>
        <p>Group guilt was what I felt when we hit the first Tsamai village and were deluged by people asking for money. Ostensibly they are asking you to take their picture, for which you then pay them. But ''photo'' really means ''money,'' because they  approach you with their hands out, whether you have a camera or not. Surely they learned this from tourists.</p>
        <p>Tourists come with innocent curiosity, but the baggage they bring inadvertently includes lessons in greed, begging and bargaining. The missionaries try to get the Mursi to remove their lip plates; the tourists try to get the Mursi to take them out so they can buy them. Tourists want to exchange ideas, but interpreters provide second-hand responses.</p>
        <p>Before tourists, the people bartered. Now they also use our money. And what are they buying with our money? The only thing I could see that any of them had that couldn't be obtained from nature were guns.</p>
        <p>Mariko Oura, the visitor from Kobe, Japan, who was quoted in the article, was right when she said: ''Frankly, I wonder if we should come.''</p>
        <p>For a sensitive traveler, surely the answer is no.</p>
