        <p>JOHN GUARE'S play ''Gardenia'' begins in 1875 with Joshua Hickman sitting on the beach at Nantucket and reading from Walt Whitman's poem ''On the Beach at Night Alone'': ''A vast similitude interlocks all.''</p>
        <p>That quotation about the interconnectedness of humanity is the central theme of the 1982 ''Gardenia'' and of the untitled cycle of plays of which it is a part. Whitman's line, though unspoken, was also at the heart of ''Six Degrees of Separation,'' Mr. Guare's 1990 play about the idea that ''everybody on this planet is separated by only six other people.'' In the world of Mr. Guare, a vast similitude interlocks all.</p>
        <p>After years of revising that earlier cycle, he has reordered it into two plays under the collective title ''Lydie Breeze'' (the name of one of the earlier plays); now in previews, the production opens on May 15 at the New York Theater Workshop. Tickets are being sold only to both plays, which can be seen on consecutive nights or the same weekend day. They are titled ''Lydie Breeze, Part 1: Bulfinch's Mythology'' (formerly ''Gardenia'') and ''Lydie Breeze, Part 2: The Sacredness of the Next Task.''</p>
        <p>The cycle, moving from the Civil War to the beginning of the 20th century, deals with American idealism and its decline through history. ''It's about what happens to our dreams,'' Mr. Guare said recently, ''what happens to the best part of ourselves and how we manage to adapt to a world that's constantly changing.'' In the plays, the characters are trying to invent a utopia, in this case a variation of Brook Farm.</p>
        <p>One common misconception about Mr. Guare is that plays like ''The House of Blue Leaves'' and ''Bosoms and Neglect'' are autobiographical but that ''Lydie Breeze'' is largely historical. Yet all his plays are personal, deriving from his own life and that of his family, both in the present and the past.</p>
        <p>The Guares immigrated to the United States from Ireland in the 1840's during the potato famine. On the maternal side of Mr. Guare's family, the Gradys, also Irish, had come over earlier in the century. His great-grandfather, who fought in the Civil War, was named Joshua Hickman, and there are also Lydies and Breezes in his genealogy. Since these relatives lived before his time, he has had to reimagine them, while remaining as true as he can to the real people behind the fictionalized characters.</p>
        <p>Asked if any chronicles of his family had been written, he laughed and said: ''Written? They weren't even oral. Nobody spoke to each other.'' From overheard conversations, memories and intimations, he has created his own chronicle, sometimes merging relatives. On one level, the plays deal with ''violence and betrayal, things that happened in my family,'' he said. ''My parents were very detached from their families and very pained by them.''</p>
        <p>He said that he loved 19th-century novels, in particular those by Balzac, George Eliot and Wilkie Collins, and his objective was to write a dramatic equivalent, a richly textured narrative. That approach, he said, ''made the family history accessible.''</p>
        <p>FOR him, ''Lydie Breeze'' is an attempt ''to drag that past into the present, and to make some sense of those dark parts of your life that you're not responsible for -- the inflicted shadows.''</p>
        <p>Last year, the revised cycle was supposed to be the cornerstone of the Guare season at the Signature Theater, but when the production proved to be too expensive, Mr. Guare rushed a new play, ''Lake Hollywood,'' into production in its stead. ''Lake Hollywood'' has since been rewritten and was staged in February at the Guthrie Theater Lab in Minneapolis. That play, too, had an earlier existence, as a one-act play that Mr. Guare wrote 40 years ago and expanded much later.</p>
        <p>After Elizabeth Marvel played Blanche in ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' at the New York Theater Workshop last year, the artistic director, James C. Nicola, invited her to look through manuscripts and choose another project. She chose the ''Lydie Breeze'' plays and, following a reading in January, Mr. Nicola decided to go ahead with a production. Ms. Marvel portrays the title character. At the playwright's request, the director is Itamar Kubovy, who staged ''Lake Hollywood'' at the Guthrie.</p>
        <p>The major change, Mr. Guare said, was that, in contrast to the original version, the plays are being performed in chronological order with the same cast and at a single theater. His revisions include excerpted passages from ''Women and Water,'' a third play in the cycle that was presented in 1985 at the Arena Stage in Washington.</p>
        <p>Mr. Guare is, he admitted, a compulsive rewriter. Thirty years ago, when ''The House of Blue Leaves'' opened at the Truck and Warehouse Theater (the predecessor of the New York Theater Workshop, on East Fourth Street in the East Village), he was presented with a shirt that read ''Captain Rewrite.'' When he is not redoing his own work, he is sometimes called in to doctor musicals. This season, he did some brushwork on the book for the revival of ''Kiss Me, Kate.''</p>
        <p>Watching a rehearsal of ''Lydie Breeze'' and hearing that line, ''a vast similitude interlocks all,'' he began thinking about its application to his life and his work. ''We ricochet around,'' he said, ''and we don't realize the connections until later.'' He remembered that his father believed strongly in ''this connective tissue.'' One day, his father ''broke all rules'' and passed on to his son the secret Masonic handshake as if it were a legacy. In times of urgency, he suggested, that secret could unlock doors.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Guare's family, his uncle Billy Grady occupied a lofty position, though he was, by his nephew's estimation, ''a monstrous man.'' For many years he was a casting director for MGM, credited with discovering James Stewart and other stars and also for his talent report on Fred Astaire (''balding, can't act, can't sing, can dance a little''). Uncle Billy, who was the model for the Hollywood director in ''The House of Blue Leaves,'' always held out the illusion that he would discover some member of the Guare family.</p>
        <p>Asked how he was discovered, Mr. Guare said, ''I can tell you exactly.'' After graduating from the Yale School of Drama, he was offered a job as an intern at Universal Studios in Hollywood. Pleased that his nephew had not come to him asking for work, Uncle Billy offered him a better position as a trainee at MGM.</p>
        <p>While he was in California, Mr. Guare visited his Aunt Louise, a member of the Guare side of the family, in San Francisco. He told her he was planning to accept Uncle Billy's offer. She said: ''Didn't you want to be a playwright? Isn't that why you went to Yale?'' He explained that he did, but that he was desperately in need of money and after working for a time in Hollywood he would return to New York to write plays. Aunt Louise said she had planned to leave him something in her will: ''But I'll make a deal with you. If you give up that job at MGM, and go back to New York and become a playwright, I'll give you the money now.''</p>
        <p>''I was terrified,'' Mr. Guare said. ''She had taken away all my excuses.'' Accepting the challenge, he returned to New York. His first week, he walked down Cornelia Street in Greenwich Village and noticed that the Caffe Cino was presenting the early work of Lanford Wilson and other writers. He realized that ''something new was happening in the theater.'' He lived off his aunt's beneficence for three years, and was even able to finance a trip to Europe. During this time he wrote several plays, including his breakthrough, ''The House of Blue Leaves'' -- and he became a playwright.</p>
        <p>''Who discovered me?'' he asked. ''It was my Aunt Louise.'' In her honor, one of his two pet pugs is named Louise and the leading character in ''Six Degrees'' is named Louisa.</p>
        <p>He went on to write many more plays, the musical ''Two Gentlemen of Verona'' and several films, including ''Atlantic City.'' Along with revising ''Lydie Breeze,'' he has been working on the book for a Broadway musical version of the movie ''Sweet Smell of Success'' (with music by Marvin Hamlisch and lyrics by Craig Carnelia).</p>
        <p>His new play, ''Chaucer in Rome,'' is scheduled for Lincoln Center Theater next season. It takes place at the American Academy in Rome (which is headed by his wife, Adele Chatfield-Taylor). In keeping with his favorite themes, the play is, he said, ''about an artist who is no longer able to work in the way he wanted to work.'' It was inspired by the story of the painter Chuck Close, who was paralyzed by a stroke and had to ''reinvent himself and create a new vocabulary.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Guare is also involved in a new film project, based on the lives of Sara and Gerald Murphy, the models for the characters in ''Tender Is the Night.'' Rereading the F. Scott Fitzgerald novel, he said, he realized that it was ''about people who create an oasis for other people to live in.''</p>
        <p>As always, he makes voluminous notes in pocket-size notebooks -- 106 so far -- about events in his life and ideas for plays. He works every day, writing his plays in longhand and then transferring them to a computer.</p>
        <p>Several years ago, in talking about his writing, Mr. Guare said: ''Everything deals with what you're afraid of: same old fears. They find new names, new costumes.'' What was he afraid of today? He paused and then, the perpetual Captain Rewrite, answered, ''Not finishing.''</p>
        <p>Through Mr. Guare's plays, even those that deal with physical and emotional mayhem, there is a current of affirmation. Now 62, he continues to greet the day with anticipation rather than apprehension. ''When I was a kid,'' he said, ''I had such enormous dreams -- to be a writer, to marry someone wonderful, to live in New York, to work in the theater -- and reality has outdone my dreams on every level.'' He added, ''The theater's my utopia.'' And he hasn't even had to use the secret handshake.</p>
