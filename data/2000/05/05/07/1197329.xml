        <p>The first time I heard confession was a couple of weeks after my ordination in 1973, at St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington, D.C., where John F. Kennedy's requiem Mass was celebrated. The penitent was a tourist who had wandered in almost by accident. ''I was on my way to a McDonald's,'' he said, ''but I saw the church and remembered Kennedy's funeral -- then I noticed the little green light in the confessional, so I came in. I'm not really sure of what I want.''</p>
        <p>''Well,'' I replied, ''I hope you don't want a Big Mac with French fries, because if so, you have made a great mistake.''</p>

        <p>The first time I heard confession was a couple of weeks after my ordination in 1973, at St. Matthew's Cathedral in Washington, D.C., where John F. Kennedy's requiem Mass was celebrated. The penitent was a tourist who had wandered in almost by accident. ''I was on my way to a McDonald's,'' he said, ''but I saw the church and remembered Kennedy's funeral -- then I noticed the little green light in the confessional, so I came in. I'm not really sure of what I want.''</p>
        <p>''Well,'' I replied, ''I hope you don't want a Big Mac with French fries, because if so, you have made a great mistake.''</p>
        <p>He chuckled, then said: ''Look, Father, it's been a long, long time. I'm going to tell you things you have never heard in confession before.''</p>
        <p>''That's not too difficult,'' I said. ''This is my first confession. Anything you say will be a shock to me.'' He started to laugh, hard. Those in line fled to the other confession line.</p>
        <p>I wasn't taking the occasion lightly. The mystical tradition speaks of something called giddiness before the sacred, a way of expressing the infinite disproportion between you and the mystery with which, somehow, you have become involved. I was simply feeling the infinite disproportion of it all.</p>
        <p>Many think of confession as a frightening exposure of the deepest self. The confessor looks into the darkest regions of the human psyche, uncovering the most embarrassing secrets -- not only what you have actually done, but also what you wanted to do. (Confessor: ''Did you entertain impure thoughts?'' Honest penitent: ''No, Father, they entertained me.'') And so, one does everything possible to seek refuge in euphemisms and abstractions and, above all, to avoid being heard by those waiting outside the confessional.</p>
        <p>And yet my experience as a confessor has had nothing to do with hearing juicy secrets. Most penitents I have had repeat formulas that they learned in second grade and refer to their sins in formal categories. I have heard things like ''I was unfaithful 23 times in deed, and about 50 times in thought.'' I remember a political exile telling me, ''I have tortured prisoners.'' I thought, ''At last, a new sin!'' But what could I say to this man -- tell him not to do it again? Suggest counseling? Then he really stunned me by asking, ''Must I tell you exactly how many times?''</p>
        <p>I have often heard confessions in very unlikely places, like subways and theaters. Once the captain of a plane approached me in midflight. Terrified, I asked him, ''Do you know something that I don't know about this flight?'' He assured me that nothing was wrong; he had simply gotten the urge. Yet what he said didn't seem urgent to me. Nor did those other on-the-spot confessions. I used to think that people who felt a burning need to confess minor infractions had no inner life -- or that their outer life was either pretty dull or, as in my torturer penitent, frighteningly immoral. Similarly, I used to think that list-style confession was a sign of an underdeveloped or legalistic view of morality.</p>
        <p>Eventually, those in charge changed the rite of confession. They added Scripture readings, encouraged a conversational style and introduced ''reconciliation rooms'' that resembled a cheap psychologist's office. Priests studied ''counseling'' and learned to modulate their voices supportively. Confession became therapy, and a confessor unable to provoke a therapeutic experience was judged worthless. In truth, however, nothing in our vocation qualified us as therapists.</p>
        <p>On the day of my ordination, my own mother, suitably proud, taught me that lesson. ''I used to think priests knew everything,'' she told me. ''Now I worry, because you are a priest and I know you don't know anything.''</p>
        <p>Since then I have come to know this: Confession is not therapy, nor is it moral accounting. At its best, it is the affirmation that the ultimate truth of our interior life is our absolute poverty, our radical dependence, our unquenchable thirst, our desperate need to be loved. As St. Augustine knew so well, confession is ultimately about praise.</p>
        <p>Confessing even the most dramatic struggles, I have found, people reach for the simplest language, that of a child before a world too confusing to understand. Silent wonder is the most natural response to a revelation that surpasses all words, a beauty that is beyond images; if one must say anything at all, what better way than in a few words that, in their very formalism, protect the infinite majesty of this mystery? The language of the inner life is not the language of experts, nor of eloquent dramatists, nor of a mature and healthy self-acceptance. The language of the inner life is a serene silence, a deep hurt, a boundless desire and, occasionally, a little laughter.</p>
