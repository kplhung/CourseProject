        <p>IT has been a season of dizzying highs, record lows and amateurs rushing in.</p>
        <p>The public cannot help but be mesmerized by twin roller coaster rides: the dazzling parallel arcs of the Nasdaq world and the world of antiques. Both offer the irresistible possibility that, despite the fact that America has always loved ''The Price Is Right,'' the price is actually wrong. It's higher.</p>
        <p>The bull market gives amateur investors the impression that the thing to own is the new, new thing. ''Antiques Roadshow'' gives amateur appraisers the impression that the thing to own is the old, old thing.</p>
        <p>In a typical moment from ''Antiques Roadshow,'' the most popular program on public television, a woman brought in a glass lamp purchased for $125. An expert told her the lamp was worth $125,000. Just like the little companies on the Nasdaq, the little lamp was suddenly, for no apparent reason, worth 1,000 times what it was supposed to be. And like the little companies, little lamps could be traded online: eBay soon let Web surfers go antiquing, and even Sotheby's and Christie's brought their gavels to the Internet.</p>
        <p>Before long, everyone and his grandmother were buying on margin and ransacking virtual yard sales. The declining American ability to focus was colliding with the ascending national economy, resulting in a new model for success, a little like Horatio Alger without the attention span.</p>
        <p>Then came the nose dives and scandals. The stock market fell. The auction house giants Christie's and Sotheby's, like the Nasdaq giant Microsoft, became the subjects of antitrust inquiries by the Justice Department, which accused them of price-fixing and collusion. Heart-rending scenes from ''Antiques Roadshow'' were revealed to be staged. The man who couldn't believe that his Civil War-era sword was worth $35,000 and said he once carved a watermelon with it was not the owner of the sword, but a friend of the appraiser.</p>
        <p>The program's producers removed the appraiser from all reruns. They also spliced out a woman who brought in a $250,000 helmet and then mysteriously disappeared amid rumors that the helmet was not hers. And eBay, the spiritual home of a nation of appraisers, is now the subject of three local and federal investigations.</p>
        <p>But the bidding continues. Aspiring analysts can play stock games on Web sites, winning prizes for speculator of the month. Aspiring appraisers can read trade secrets in Carol Prisant's ''Antiques Roadshow Primer'' and make estimates interactively on the PBS Internet site. On the cable channel HGTV, they can watch ''Appraise It!'' or ''The Great Antiques Hunt,'' a program that combines elements of roadshow and game show. Contestants choose antiques at a fair and win points based on the value of their selections. They also estimate the cost of estate jewelry, identify furniture and guess the ages of buildings.</p>
        <p>As opposed to ''The Price Is Right,'' where contestants pride themselves on knowing what things actually cost, contestants on ''The Great Antiques Hunt'' revel in imagining what things might bring.</p>
        <p>At first the fascination with old-world beauty seemed a reaction to the high-technology revolution. Technophobes and neo-Victorians alarmed by life in a cold electronic age grew nostalgic for the comfort of physical design. Traditionalists perturbed by the mass of paper wealth and new money yearned for the nobility of good taste.</p>
        <p>The British, who originally gave America Christie's and Sotheby's, also exported ''Antiques Roadshow,'' ''The Great Antiques Hunt'' and (after making the questions easier) ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' spreading the reassuring notion that riches can flow from collecting or knowing arcana.</p>
        <p>But strangely enough this obsession with the old has also been fueled by new technology: the Internet has given collectors novel and ideal ways of interacting. By reaching mass audiences, the Net has driven up the prices of some collectibles even as it has driven down the prices of everyday items.</p>
        <p>On eBay, as contemporary alchemists turn Pez dispensers into gold, those obsessed with the old and those obsessed with the new exchange bric-a-brac. A Sumerian fertility amulet dating from 3000 B.C. can find new buyers in cyberspace.</p>
        <p>In a larger sense, the fascination with old and new are part of the same  mania. Both roller coasters promise accessibility, immediacy and the wonder of hidden value. With the democratization of investing, anyone can order shares of Qualcomm while sitting home in a bathrobe. And the formerly insular antiques world has come to the public, intimating that those with an eye for talent can spot the value not only of the next Intel but of the tarnished teapot in the attic.</p>
        <p>Professional appraisers on television sometimes take up to several hours off camera checking a research library. But the viewers don't see the work involved, only the result, as a moldy footstool morphs into a small fortune in a matter of seconds.  This is better than reality television: it's television edited to celebrate reality. In a flash, the pompous owner of a fake Faberge egg is humiliated; the unassuming bearer of a genuine Regency box is exalted.</p>
        <p>THE forces at work here are more poignant than mere greed. The fantasy of ''Antiques Roadshow'' is that the chair you loved because your Aunt Tillie gave it to you might also bring in six figures. It is the fantasy that sentimental value can translate into market value, that feelings and family bonds can matter in a material world. It's the fantasy that our old stuff is worth something and that, by extension, we are, too. Going on ''Antiques Roadshow'' is like holding an emotional I.P.O. for your garage -- an expert can tell you that you're worth more than you previously suspected.</p>
        <p>Such fantasies reveal how yet another British import, Harry Potter, has become the best-selling fairy tale of the moment. Readers cherish the idea that a boy neglected in the everyday world has magical powers and fancy lineage in a parallel, enchanted realm. There, eccentricities can turn out to be talents, weird relatives can turn out to be brilliant wizards and the worthless can become powerful.</p>
        <p>The public wants to be transported to that place, where the money-losing start-up venture becomes a dot-com to watch and the rickety armchair in the corner is transformed into a priceless heirloom. Losers can become winners, not only of net worth but of self-worth: by all accounts, a happy ending.</p>
