        <p>Nothing enraptures lawmakers in an election year like a prolonged discussion about the needs of school children, an issue that ranks sky high in importance for voters.</p>
        <p>This week, the Senate delved into the year's most important education bill, a piece of legislation that would provide nearly $15 billion in education money, most of it for impoverished students. Democrats fashioned a ''war room'' with a chalkboard, school desks and computers, where senators conducted on-line chats about education. Republicans countered with snazzy charts and a steady flow of news conferences inside and outside the Capitol.</p>
        <p>But behind all the razzle-dazzle lies one startling possibility: This could be the first time in 35 years that an education bill so bogs down over partisan differences that it is vetoed by a president, if it does not get yanked from the Senate floor altogether.</p>
        <p>''I've never seen things so contentious,'' said Christopher Cross, a former senior Republican aide in the House who is now president of the nonprofit Council for Basic Education. ''And I've never seen them take so long to enact a piece of education legislation. We are now well into the second year, and it looks as if they won't get anything enacted.''</p>
        <p>Instead of trying to write bipartisan legislation, Republicans and Democrats have seized the debate to showcase their opposing remedies for ailing schools. The fact that Vice President Al Gore and Gov. George W. Bush of Texas have turned education into a signature issue has only served to infuse this year's Senate debate with partisan rancor.</p>
        <p>Fuming Democrats say they never bungled the education bill, a measure revising and extending federal school programs that comes up every six years, when they were in charge. They accuse Republicans of trying to jam through proposals that would devastate low-income schools. ''The Democrats never made this a partisan issue,'' said Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, who is the Senate dean on education issues. ''It's inexcusable.''</p>
        <p>Republicans reply that Democrats purposely want to thwart the bill so they can turn around and label Republicans anti-education on the campaign stump and hold their advantage with voters on the issue. They say Democrats are beholden to the teachers' unions and so entrenched in the status quo they do not want to try anything new.</p>
        <p>''We have functioned for 35 years under a system developed by Democrats in Congress,'' said Senator Judd Gregg, Republican of New Hampshire. ''And we've had 35 years of kids who haven't been able to read or write.''</p>
        <p>If the bill founders this year, the consequences would not be catastrophic, which is one reason the Senate does not feel compelled to compromise. The Department of Education, and the local schools, would still receive their $14 billion under the current regulations without a change in policy.</p>
        <p>But the wrangling over the bill illustrates just how far apart the two parties stand in addressing the frustrations of parents, and demonstrates how deeply politicized the question of education has become on Capitol Hill.</p>
        <p>''In a way, you have both playing to the extremes of their parties,'' said Amy Wilkins, the principle partner for the Education Trust, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that focuses on poor children. ''Are these guys going to grow up or are they going to continue to posture?''</p>
        <p>As it stands now, President Clinton is likely to veto the bill if Republicans stay wedded to several of their proposals. One would send billions of dollars directly to the states through block grants, giving governors leeway over how to spend the money.</p>
        <p>Democrats say the states need to be held responsible for how they spend their money. Republicans maintain that their bill would tie the money to improved academic performance.</p>
        <p>''There is virtually no accountability on the Republican side with the blank-check approach they use in their block grants,'' said Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader.</p>
        <p>A second component would permit some disadvantaged students to switch public schools and take their federal dollars with them, a move Republicans said would prompt underachieving schools to shape up. Democrats argue that the measure would drain money away from the schools that need it most.</p>
        <p>What's needed, Democrats argue, is more money to spend on more teachers, to fix decrepit school buildings and to help poor children. This remedy, which originated with President Clinton, is widely supported by the teachers' unions,</p>
        <p>The legislation and the debate crystallizes the fundamental differences between the two parties.</p>
        <p>Despite deep philosophical divisions, each side has made concessions. Republicans, who vowed a few years ago to dismantle the Department of Education, have increased federal spending on education several years in a row. And Democrats are more willing to demand accountability for education programs.</p>
        <p>Frustrated with the lack of consensus, a small group of moderate Senate Democrats, led by Senator Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut, and Evan Bayh of Indiana, is pushing alternative legislation that poaches ideas from both parties. The two senators agree that local school districts need more money and more flexibility to spend the money they get, but they also need oversight.</p>
        <p>In the House, Representative Nancy L. Johnson, Republican of Connecticut, and Representative Charles B. Rangel, Democrat of New York, have banded together to pass a bipartisan bill on school construction.</p>
        <p>These efforts at compromise could well be thwarted by the forces of election year politics. ''People want to be concerned about having an issue,'' Mr. Lieberman said last month.</p>
        <p>Despite the endless debate on education policy in Washington and on the campaign trail, education experts and lobbyists say both parties end up distorting the influence the federal government has on a child's education. The $15 billion being talked about is only about 7 percent of the budget for all education spending, and the bulk is directed at disadvantaged children.</p>
        <p>''The public is going to be led to believe that problems will be solved at the national level, and they won't be,'' said Mr. Cross of the Council for Basic Education. ''They are solved school by school.''</p>
