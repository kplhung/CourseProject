        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''When Celebrity Hearts Bleed'' (April 16), Robin Bronk, coordinator of the Creative Coalition, says, ''The reality is that issues are searching for celebrity voices,'' but she errs in adding, ''and that is relatively new.''</p>
        <p>Since the civil rights era, celebrities have played a critical role in the ultimate success of socio-political causes. For example, where would the antiwar and antinuke movements have been without the many celebrity rock musicians and other entertainers who took up the causes? And where would the environmental movement be without stars like Sting and others staying in the forefront? Most cogently, the entire AIDS movement was, and still is, headed up by musicians, actors, dancers, sports figures and other celebrities. In fact, from John Lennon to Magic Johnson, from James Taylor and Joan Baez to Bono and Eddie Vedder, celebrities have been pivotal in bringing public awareness to socio-political issues.</p>

        <p>William Kristol, the editor of The Weekly Standard, says, ''You have to ask if the most successful causes had celebrities as their spokespersons.'' Based on the history of social causes in America over the last three decades, the answer is a resounding yes.</p>
