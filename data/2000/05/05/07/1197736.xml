        <p>Comments on controversy within West Virginia's Republican Party, stemming from comments by party chairman David Tyson that incumbent Democratic Sen Robert C Byrd, who has served seven six-year terms in US Senate, may be impossible to beat in November election (S)</p>

        <p>There may be members of the United States Senate more entrenched than Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia. But surely not many. Mr. Byrd, a Democrat and exceptionally adroit procurer of political bacon, has won seven six-year terms, most by two to one or better, and the expectation is that he will win an eighth term this fall by at least that much.</p>
        <p>So this is what David Tyson, the chairman of the West Virginia Republican Party, had to say last week when he was asked whether the party's primary on Tuesday might produce a viable Byrd challenger:</p>

        <p>There may be members of the United States Senate more entrenched than Robert C. Byrd of West Virginia. But surely not many. Mr. Byrd, a Democrat and exceptionally adroit procurer of political bacon, has won seven six-year terms, most by two to one or better, and the expectation is that he will win an eighth term this fall by at least that much.</p>
        <p>So this is what David Tyson, the chairman of the West Virginia Republican Party, had to say last week when he was asked whether the party's primary on Tuesday might produce a viable Byrd challenger:</p>
        <p>''Running against Byrd is like running against an icon. Senator Byrd is an institution, and there's no denying that he could be impossible to beat.''</p>
        <p>That, to use an old George Wallace political aphorism, was putting the hay down where the goat could get it.</p>
        <p>One of the two primary contenders, Garry Adkins, an accountant, took umbrage. He accused Mr. Tyson of ''assisting a Democrat'' and demanded that the party remove him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tyson's reply:</p>
        <p>''I do not endorse Democrats. I support the Republican Party.''</p>
        <p>No action, thus far, by the party and no complaint, thus far, from the other primary contender, David Gallaher, a businessman.</p>
