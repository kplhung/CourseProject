        <p>Spree makes the game-winning shot and steals the victory from Toronto!</p>
        <p>It is predictable. Intellectual thirty-something white male is fascinated by Latrell Sprewell. I confess that I never noticed the Knicks other than to pity them when Jordan was around. Forgive me for gawking at M. J. -- God was in the building. Then he retired, and I could look around. This season I could be justified in jumping onto the Shaq-Kobe bandwagon to L.A.; after all, my Zen master, Phil Jackson, is the coach. But my heart and my cheers must go for New York and Spree.</p>

        <p>Spree makes the game-winning shot and steals the victory from Toronto!</p>
        <p>It is predictable. Intellectual thirty-something white male is fascinated by Latrell Sprewell. I confess that I never noticed the Knicks other than to pity them when Jordan was around. Forgive me for gawking at M. J. -- God was in the building. Then he retired, and I could look around. This season I could be justified in jumping onto the Shaq-Kobe bandwagon to L.A.; after all, my Zen master, Phil Jackson, is the coach. But my heart and my cheers must go for New York and Spree.</p>
        <p>Understand, the University of Chicago, where I am in the final stages of studying for my doctorate in divinity and where I also went to college, has no sports program to speak of: all my frustration-venting coach-chokings must be vicarious. I am so much like Spree, or want to be. I understand him. Being in graduate school, like being a player in the National Basketball Association, people treat you like children, belittle your best efforts, submit you to the petty whims of their unquestionable authority. Professors and coaches (look out, Bobby Knight) often need a good choking.</p>
        <p>So, I confess, I did not know Spree from any other SportsCenter highlight hero until he put the alleged grip on that coach who looked, to me anyway, like someone who loved the ring of his hollow bark and who referred to his team as his boys, a bunch of good kids, though sometimes you had to get in their face so they could smell your breath.</p>
        <p>I first took notice of Spree in his suit and tie, not in uniform. Just pictures. He seemed the angry black man, pugnacious and mean. Then I heard him speak, and he was angry, but he was also articulate, focused, poised. Spree speaks with the measure and sensitivity (aside from messing up his ''good's'' and ''well's'') that any professor would want to bring to the classroom. Suddenly his hairdo (now popular with others in the game) no longer struck me as punkish, but neatly pleated, patterned in herringbone. I noticed his eyes: large, glowing, orblike eyes, the sideways-looking eyes of certain flamboyant goldfish or the sad, world-weary eyes of those small dogs first bred in ancient China.</p>
        <p>And then on the court: he seems to flow and hover, touching the floor only at the toes and edges of his shoes, like a skater, always gliding in circles, describing arabesques. Until he makes his cut -- ''cut'' is the precise word to convey his move to the hoop. A deft stab through the crowd of bystanding players and then the flash of the dunk. It's a thrill! I say, I wanna be like Spree!</p>
        <p>O.K., everyone will confess, he's no Jordan. He's less than Jordan, but he's also more. When he turns, after the dunk, to float and flow back on defense, he frowns with satisfaction, sucking in his lower lip and flourishing his fist for the triumph of 2 points. Spree shows himself more human than Jordan ever was (perhaps Michael was too great to be human). Not handsome, Spree's jaw is clenched too hard, he still can't help but look angry. Achilles was known for being angry. And Spree's eyes are too large, too expressive, too much the self-conscious human I know I must be.</p>
        <p>That's it, I've got to read and write till the next game (this one in Miami today), but, boy, I'd drop all these books on God to know what it is to play like Spree.</p>
