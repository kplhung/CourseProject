        <p>Never before has the expression ''it's a nice place to visit but I wouldn't want to live there'' been more pertinent. The city is geared for the pleasure of the tourists. They may love ''the spectacle of over-the-top commercialism'' but the residents like myself (at 43rd Street and Ninth Avenue) dread venturing into the garish spectacle that is an assault and an affront to the eye.</p>

        <p>I'm dreading the moment the the tops of the Empire State and Chrysler Buildings are covered with advertising. I cringe when I look at what they've done to the old Times building (the one in the middle of Times Square). If this is progress, I'll take the porn houses. They at least did not impose their values on us.</p>
