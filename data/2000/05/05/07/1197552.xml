        <p>In the 1940's, when Ann Greco and her older sister Fran were growing up on 10th Street, they used to play in a park across the street from their house.</p>
        <p>''Oh, it was beautiful,'' Ms. Greco recalled. ''We had handball in front, we had shuffleboard, we had horseshoes, we had basketball and swings, we had monkey bars and slides. There was a park house on a mound, and a fellow that took care of the park.''</p>

        <p>In the 1940's, when Ann Greco and her older sister Fran were growing up on 10th Street, they used to play in a park across the street from their house.</p>
        <p>''Oh, it was beautiful,'' Ms. Greco recalled. ''We had handball in front, we had shuffleboard, we had horseshoes, we had basketball and swings, we had monkey bars and slides. There was a park house on a mound, and a fellow that took care of the park.''</p>
        <p>Today, the two-acre site between Second and Third Avenues, under the elevated tracks of the F train, resembles an abandoned parking lot. Passers-by peering through the chain link fence might recognize the handball walls sunken into the concrete or the basketball backboard still standing at one end. But the only real indication of the site's identity is the sign reading ''Under the Tracks Playground.''</p>
        <p>The efforts of the Greco sisters to resuscitate their childhood park date to the 1960's, when they wrote Mayor John V. Lindsay asking for money. The mayor never responded, but over the years, elected officials began to pay attention.</p>
        <p>In the mid-1990's, Councilwoman Joan McCabe allocated $250,000 to rehabilitate the ailing park, and in 1998 her successor, Councilman Angel Rodriguez, added an additional $450,000. Currently the total budget is $916,000. In 1996, Parks Commissioner Henry J. Stern renamed the park Fran Brady Under the Tracks Playground in honor of a community leader.</p>
        <p>But the park's location threatened to doom it. In 1995, when pieces of concrete falling from the tracks above posed a safety hazard, the department closed the park and surrounded it with a high fence. Subsequently, the department determined that the ground underneath was unstable, filled with debris from houses demolished in the 1930's.</p>
        <p>And although last year Community Board 6 approved a Park Department proposal to install new asphalt, a new fence, and trees and shrubs, the plan was shelved when the Transit Authority began a 30-month project to remove the loose concrete.</p>
        <p>Some people are getting restless. The city money is likely to be reallocated to another project, to be replaced once the park is ready for refurbishing. Ann Greco has almost given up.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Stern said the project was still on track.</p>
        <p>''This is certainly one of our less fortunate playgrounds, because it's under the tracks,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But, he added, ''it has a nice name.''</p>
