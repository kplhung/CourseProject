      <block class="full_text">
        <p>IN the tens of thousands of high school line scores across the country this baseball season, one last month involving Croton-Harmon and Rye Neck High Schools is probably unique.</p>
        <p>Collin Rich of Croton-Harmon pitched a no-hitter.</p>
        <p>He also got the game's only hit.</p>
        <p>He was also the losing pitcher.</p>
        <p>Perhaps losing a no-hitter set the tone for the season. Croton-Harmon is 0-10 under the first-year coach Mark Duncan, going into tomorrow's home game against North Salem.</p>
        <p>It did not upset Rich, a 5-foot-10, 155-pounder, who is a 95 student and headed for Haverford College in Pennsylvania, though not on an athletic scholarship. ''All I could do was laugh,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''It seemed pretty funny. I mean, I'd walked a couple of guys, made some mistakes -- I was surprised I had a no-hitter.''</p>
        <p>Most young pitchers dream of a no-hitter. It was not Rich's dream, for he was not a pitcher.</p>
        <p>''He is one of our best hitters and a third baseman with a good arm,'' Duncan said. ''We were short on pitching, so Collin has been a pitcher.''</p>
        <p>That day he lost 3 to 1. It was his first year of pitching since he was a Little Leaguer. ''A couple of runs in the first on two walks, a double steal and an error and a run later on a passed ball,'' Duncan explained. ''Collin was not overpowering, but he was hitting spots, throwing strikes that day.''</p>
        <p>His hit was not a fluke. ''A line drive over the shortstop's head,'' Rich said.</p>
        <p>Will Rich, a senior, remain a pitcher in college? ''I don't think so,'' Duncan said. ''But he is a good hitter and a bright young man.'' And he is hitting  .318 and batting fifth for Croton-Harmon.</p>
        <p>Neither losing a no-hitter nor a season-long losing streak has discouraged Duncan. ''This is a rebuilding program -- the team was 2-16 last year,'' Duncan, who works for the Croton Recreation Department, said. ''We've got a jayvee team for the first time in four years and an active seventh-  and eighth-grade program.''</p>
        <p>The high school has only 350 students.</p>
        <p>''The players are learning and getting something out of it,'' Duncan added. ''If a kid leaves a better person, that's what coaching is about. Wins and losses will come and go.''</p>
        <p>Still, the losses are starting to weigh on the team. ''We were a little down after today,'' Rich conceded after the last defeat, a 12-to-2 setback at Tuckahoe last Monday.</p>
        <p>Asked if he planned to play baseball at Haverford and if so would he try to pitch, Rich replied, ''I'm not sure, but I'll probably go out for the team and probably as a hitter.''</p>
        <p>As for Coach Duncan, he is no stranger to the vagaries of baseball. After playing college ball at Cortlandt State, he played shortstop in the minor leagues for two seasons, with independent teams in Lethbridge in Alberta, Canada, and then in Johnstown, Pa.</p>
        <p>That second year, 1995, he batted .350 for Johnstown -- and found that no one wanted a 23-year-old shortstop who had hit .350 in the lower minors. ''That was old in baseball terms,'' he said. ''I was done.''</p>
        <p>He is just beginning at Croton-Harmon. As he said, the victories will come.</p>
        <p>Pro Tennis Tournament</p>
        <p>Professional tennis comes to Westchester on May 15 when the U.S.T.A. Men's Challenger Series opens at the Canyon Club in Armonk, N.Y.</p>
        <p>It is the first time a Challenger Series event has been held in the county.</p>
        <p>Among those scheduled to compete in the six-day tournament are Justin Gimelstob, ranked 91st in the world, who competed against Andre Agassi in the U.S. Open; James Blake, a Yonkers native ranked 221st, and Cecil Mamiit, ranked 139th.</p>
        <p>Weekday tickets start at $10, and weekend tickets at $15. They may be bought through Ticketmaster or at the gate. Additional information is available by calling 512-5005.</p>
        <p>The players will compete for more than $50,000 in prize money and Association of Tennis Professionals points, which determine future rankings.</p>
