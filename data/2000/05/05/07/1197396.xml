        <p>LIKE almost every municipality in Connecticut, Wallingford is struggling with the issue of purchasing so-called open spaces, those undeveloped parcels of land that are disappearing every month and becoming a part of the suburban sprawl.</p>
        <p>Last year, Wallingford bought a 20.9-acre plot of land for about $45,000 per acre off Tyler Mill Road. The town already owned most of the woodland 900 acres surrounding the parcel and it wanted to protect the whole area against residential development. Some residents and town officials immediately criticized the town for overpaying for the land.</p>
        <p>Then last month the town bought a 47.06-acre parcel off Scard Road for $1.2 million, about $239,000 more than the value set by an appraiser. The purchase price jumped because a real estate developer had a provisional contract with the seller and already held a wetlands permit to build a 10-lot subdivision there.</p>
        <p>Town Councilor Jim Vumbaco would like to see Wallingford officials become more pro-active in acquiring these tracts of land by getting involved before the developers  do.</p>
        <p>''I believe we have been overpaying.  We've let the tail wag the dog with some of these transactions,'' Mr. Vumbaco said.</p>
        <p>What has happened in these recent cases, he said, is that ''we seem to wait until a developer shows interest in a piece of land and moves to get permits for subdividing, and then we become motivated to buy the land, which now has a much higher price than it would have had if the town had been the first to offer the landowner.''</p>
        <p>Town Councilor Tom Zappala agreed. ''We have had no follow-through procedures,'' Mr. Zappala said. ''We wait until our backs are against the wall and then we buy.''</p>
        <p>To the charge that the town is paying retail prices when it should be paying wholesale, Mayor William Dickinson said: ''It's difficult for government not to pay market value for land. We really can't pay a wholesale price. The state requires two appraisals when we buy land, and appraisals are market value.''</p>
        <p>And, he points out that in the long run the town saves money by not having to expand its costly public services for open land, as it does with land developed for residences or businesses. The mayor added that many land owners agree to sell to the town for less money than a developer might offer out of a sense of civic responsibility.</p>
        <p>Since 1984, about 100,000 acres of Connecticut farmland have been sold to housing or mall developers. Recognizing the need to act, the Connecticut General Assembly passed a bill in 1998 creating the Open Space Acquisition Program, which was implemented to aid towns in the purchasing of these spaces by offering grants for up to 60 percent of the sale price. The state's goal is to set aside 21 percent of Connecticut's land as open space by 2023.</p>
        <p>Wallingford, which is near the center of the state (with easy access to Interstate 91, Interstate 84 and the Merritt Parkway), has felt the pressure applied by developers and industrialists. With a population of 42,000, it is one of the largest towns in the state. According to the American Farmland Trust, Wallingford sits in an area (New Haven County and three surrounding ones) that is the 10th most-threatened in the country.</p>
        <p>''I think the public is leading this issue and is out in front on it,'' said Town Councilman Michael Brodinsky. ''The public wants the town to grab and define its destiny.''</p>
        <p>Town leaders have become increasingly concerned about what development may mean for Wallingford's identity.</p>
        <p>''The rural heritage has always been part of the history of the town,'' said Mr. Dickinson, referring to the numerous farms that still fan out beyond the town's residential areas. ''But the farmers are getting older, and many of their younger generations aren't as interested in farming.''</p>
        <p>These days, developers target land owners with a large parcel of open space in order to build homes or businesses on the land. But as even critics of some of the purchases will admit, there is much more land potentially available than the town could ever afford to buy. Is there a foolproof, systematic way to buy up open spaces, or is it catch-as-catch-can?</p>
        <p>In 1997, a year before the Tyler Mill purchase, Mr. Dickinson charged the Wallingford Conservation Commission, a volunteer committee headed by Jeff Borne, to come up with a vision and plan for the acquisition of land. The committee compiled an inventory of all the existing open space properties and recommended communicating regularly with landowners about the town's interest in having a fair opportunity to buy open spaces they might sell.</p>
        <p>But the town does not have someone whose responsibility it is to follow up on the committee's work. Consequently, as in the Scard Road purchase, Mr. Zappala said the town found itself paying a higher price for land because a developer had already gotten a permit to build houses, making a deal to purchase the land more firm.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dickinson said that Wallingford is third in the state in municipalities going after grant money under the Open Spaces Acquisition Program. But even he concedes that the town must do a better job of following up on land parcels the town has targeted for purchase.</p>
        <p>How will Wallingford use its purchased open spaces? Mr. Dickinson said that land bought through state grants cannot be improved in any way. The town cannot turn them into playing fields or golf courses, for instance. In the short term he would like to work out some kind of lease plans with the farmers. For the long term, he said he envisioned the town making inventories of the lands' special features and then developing a vision of what the town would like them to be.</p>
        <p>''One hundred years from now the Tyler Mill will be Wallingford's Central Park,'' he predicted.</p>
