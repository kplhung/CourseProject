        <p>In mid-January 1999, Coach Pat Riley and Randy Pfund, the Miami Heat general manager, were holed up at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in the Buckhead neighborhood of Atlanta. Working the phones furiously, they had one goal in mind:</p>
        <p>They wanted to meet with Latrell Sprewell. ''Bob, what's going on?'' Riley asked Robert Gist, Sprewell's agent, after many conversations the weekend of Jan. 16-17. ''Is he coming or not? Let's try to work something out.''</p>
        <p>''I can't get a hold of him,'' Gist told Riley from his Atlanta office. ''Just give me a little more time. I want you to talk to him. We'll set something up.''</p>
        <p>Riley and Pfund were seriously considering a blockbuster trade. They believed Sprewell was on his way from Milwaukee to meet with them. He had yet to be dealt from the Golden State Warriors and was still regarded as America's most demonized athlete, the player who choked his coach and got away with it.</p>
        <p>He was not the consummate teammate, the counterculture hero who will lead the Knicks into the second-round playoff series against the Heat Sunday in Game 1 at American Airlines Arena, the player who changed the balance of power in the Eastern Conference the day the Knicks acquired him.</p>
        <p>Looking back, the pendulum swung toward New York that weekend.</p>
        <p>Four members of the Knicks management boarded a Cablevision jet on Sunday, Jan. 17, and swooped into Milwaukee: Madison Square Garden's president, Dave Checketts; Coach Jeff Van Gundy; Ernie Grunfeld, then the general manager; and Ed Tapscott, then the assistant general manager. They impressed upon Sprewell that Madison Square Garden was the place for him.</p>
        <p>A flummoxed Riley found out about the Knicks-Sprewell meeting after the fact. He called Sprewell the next day to gauge his interest, but realized New York's pitch had influenced his decision.</p>
        <p>''Perhaps in retrospect, if Pat had got to Latrell's home and met with him, things would have been different,'' Gist said Friday. ''I wanted to put them together. Pat had me so pumped up after talking to him, I wanted to play for him. I thought Latrell should hear what he had to say.''</p>
        <p>Riley would not comment on circumstances that happened 16 months ago, other than acknowledging that he had spoken to Sprewell and Gist. ''There were a lot of teams interested in Latrell at that point,'' Riley said.</p>
        <p>But according to an Eastern Conference team official who spoke on condition of anonymity, Riley was prepared to fly to Milwaukee to meet with Sprewell. After hearing from Gist that the Knicks were already there, Riley's interest waned.</p>
        <p>''I kind of liken it to the guy who has a big crush on the prom queen, but he doesn't act on it,'' Gist said. ''So, finally, you get the nerve to go to her home and ol' Billy Bob is already there. I would have gotten on a plane and made my own presentation, made her forget about the other guy. But once Pat heard they were there, he figured it was too late.''</p>
        <p>The events of Jan. 16-17, 1999, have produced more far-reaching conspiracy theories than genuine facts, with several team officials accusing Commissioner David Stern of steering Sprewell toward the Knicks.</p>
        <p>Privately, Stern was trying to quickly free the Warriors of a growing burden: heading into training camp with Sprewell on the roster. The league argued that any team could have asked for and received permission to visit Sprewell.</p>
        <p>Still, more than a year later, the events leading up to the deal make for intrigue and gossip.</p>
        <p>Sprewell cannot remember all the details, other than recalling that he was talking to the Knicks at the same time Gist was speaking to Riley about scheduling a meeting.</p>
        <p>''I talked to Riles one time on the phone and I think it was after the Knicks were at my house,'' Sprewell said last week. ''Yeah, a day or two after.</p>
        <p>''Riles just wanted to see if I had any interest in coming down there. We really just talked about working and what it would take to be a Riley player. Because, as you know, he works guys pretty hard. I think I would have been fine.''</p>
        <p>Asked if he was surprised Miami did not pull the trigger first, he said: ''I was very surprised. I thought if anyone wanted to do it, it would have been Riles. I thought he would have been the one to make it happen.''</p>
        <p>The Eastern Conference team official said Riley tried, offering the Heat starters P. J. Brown and Dan Majerle at the last possible moment. A Warriors team official contends that Miami never offered anything better than a package including Duane Causwell and Voshon Lenard.</p>
        <p>Either way, many in the Heat camp believe that Grunfeld's friendly relationship with Golden State's general manager, Garry St. Jean, contributed to the Heat's being left out of the Sprewell loop. The Knicks were offering Chris Childs, Chris Mills and Terry Cummings. At the last moment, they included John Starks in the three-for-one deal instead of Childs.</p>
        <p>Grunfeld met St. Jean during the 1977-78 season while playing for the Bucks. St. Jean was a Milwaukee scout. St. Jean has known Riley for more than 20 years, too. But as Riley's stature, power and bank account grew over the years, the distance between himself and his colleagues widened considerably.</p>
        <p>''I knew whatever he told me, I could believe,'' Grunfeld said of St. Jean. ''We weren't going to play the little games that are usually played in this league.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks had another advantage. Grunfeld's in-laws lived in Sprewell's suburban Milwaukee neighborhood, and he had often driven by Sprewell's house. The Knicks' party never asked for directions and Sprewell had not even known they were coming that afternoon. Before Riley or anyone could react, they were in the front door.</p>
        <p>''After we left,'' Grunfeld said of Riley's pursuit, ''I knew from his agent that he stiffed them. He didn't show up, that's what I heard.''</p>
        <p>Riley was not the only person who felt bamboozled.</p>
        <p>''I was mad,'' Gist said. ''I didn't know the Knicks were there until Latrell called me after Checketts had left. I told him: 'Pat Riley is on the phone and you have already met with these guys? Come on, Latrell.' He said he wanted to play for New York. I said: 'I don't want to tell Pat that. You have to talk to him.' ''</p>
        <p>In hindsight, Sprewell said, ''I really think New York initially was just doing it to keep him from getting me there. I think once they thought it was getting really serious, they got serious about preventing him from getting me.''</p>
        <p>Gist laughed when asked if he thought that chaotic January weekend dramatically shaped the future of both franchises.</p>
        <p>''Shoot, I would've given Pat his address,'' he said. ''All he had to do was ask. The Knicks didn't even put Latrell on notice. They were there in a heartbeat.</p>
        <p>''Oh well. The girl enjoyed the prom and they both lived happily thereafter.''</p>
