        <p>To the Editor: Regarding ''Flying with JetBlue, the New Kid in the Air'' (Correspondent's Report, March 12), I, too, flew on JetBlue Flight 1  from Buffalo to Kennedy Airport, as well as a return flight the next day, using Buffalo rather than Rochester's higher priced airport. I did not see the ''flurry'' of disregard witnessed by the author, David Cay Johnston.</p>
        <p>Turn-around is quicker because the cabin is cleaned before landing, and the few minutes' delay was made up in flight. True, TV service is not yet available, but vouchers for viewing were distributed.</p>

        <p>If Mr. Johnston had chosen Gray Line, he could have walked one minute to ground transportation, punched in a number, waited five minutes, and had a $14 ride to Manhattan. The reverse is available for a return flight.</p>
        <p>JetBlue is efficient and inexpensive, welcomed by those who have paid far more.</p>
