        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I speak as the driver of a car that screams ''Mom'' (a 1993 Toyota Camry wagon). Let me assure the women who drive these monster trucks to ferry the kids to and from  activities that their S.U.V.'s scream ''Mom'' every bit as loudly as any minivan or wagon on the road.</p>
        <p>What some drivers of these S.U.V.'s mistakenly label as respect, is, in fact, fear -- fear of the damage they can inflict on other, smaller vehicles and fear of how they restrict the other drivers' ability to see the road. I also worry about those S.U.V. drivers who, feeling invulnerable, might take undue risks.</p>

        <p>Would drivers of these trucks love them so much if they were forced to pay a fair share of the human, property and environmental damage they cause?</p>
