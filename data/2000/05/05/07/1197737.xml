        <p>Democrats in Virginia's Fifth Congressional District were not especially surprised earlier this year when Representative Virgil H. Goode, a lifelong member of their party, announced he would seek re-election this fall as an independent and caucus with Republicans should he win. His votes on Capitol Hill had been trending Republican for some time.</p>
        <p>How hard will it be to win re-election as an independent?</p>
        <p>Probably not all that difficult. Both Democrats and Republicans in the district, in the south-central part of the state, tend to be strongly conservative, and in earlier elections Mr. Goode not only got the Democratic vote but also a lot of the Republican vote. What is more, the district, like Mr. Goode, has been trending Republican for some time.</p>
        <p>So with no strong Democratic challenger in the offing -- and no Republican even running -- he seems well positioned to win again. But just to be safe, he tried last week to soften  what Democratic opposition there is.</p>
        <p>Any Democrat who gave him campaign money before he became an independent, he said, can mail in a request for a refund -- he has almost $400,000 in his war chest -- and it will be considered.</p>
        <p>As of the weekend, only one request had come in, for $50, and the check was in the mail, with a note of thanks for past support.</p>
