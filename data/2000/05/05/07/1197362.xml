        <p>THE first-time writer-directors Anthony Stark and Sean Smith, best friends since high school, are in a difficult position when they talk about their new movie, ''Into My Heart'' -- a dark story about two men, best friends since childhood, whose relationship takes a tragic turn after they grow up and get married.

        <p>THE first-time writer-directors Anthony Stark and Sean Smith, best friends since high school, are in a difficult position when they talk about their new movie, ''Into My Heart'' -- a dark story about two men, best friends since childhood, whose relationship takes a tragic turn after they grow up and get married. (The film opened Friday at the Quad Cinema.)</p>
        <p>At first, Mr. Stark and Mr. Smith, both 39, best friends since they met in 1977 at the Browning School on Manhattan's Upper East Side, insist there is ''only a little autobiography'' in the story of Ben and Adam, two sons of affluent East Coast families who are ''like two olives in a martini,'' according to Adam's father, yet very different.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stark and Mr. Smith's reluctance to admit that their art may imitate life could be more than the usual insistence by writers that their creation is a work of fiction, not real life. The character of Ben, played by Rob Morrow, the chief instigator in the movie's twisted quadrangle, raises uncomfortable questions about betrayal and infidelity and whether so-called nice, normal people can commit destructive, hurtful acts.</p>
        <p>''People who see it focus on Ben as this monolith of evil,'' Mr. Stark said. ''Many people just don't want to believe that good people can do bad things. We wanted to show the moral hypocrisy of that and ask who can presume you couldn't do what these people did.''</p>
        <p>On a more mundane level, Mr. Stark and Mr. Smith will admit to being part of an upper-middle-class social circle like that of the WASPy young adults in the film. The movie's characters spend weekends at Adam's family's country house in the Berkshires and play word games like the ''name game''; Mr. Stark has been a frequent guest at Mr. Smith's family's weekend house near the Berkshires and the name game is one of their favorites. And Mr. Stark said he modeled Adam's wife on a woman he knows well.</p>
        <p>''I think they're a lot more like Ben and Adam than they claim,'' said Mr. Morrow, 37, who signed on for the low-budget film after being won over by the script. ''I've heard them talk about the movie and pass it off as if it isn't their story. But you hear the characters of Ben and Adam come out of their voices.''</p>
        <p>The character of Ben is restless, cynical, ambitious -- and a veteran of bad relationships. Adam, played by Jake Weber, described as a ''golden boy'' in the film, is romantic, loyal -- and happily married to Nina, the love of his life, a woman he meets in college. Nina, played by Claire Forlani, becomes the catalyst that shatters the friendship between Ben and Adam forever.</p>
        <p>Cut to a table at the Algonquin Hotel recently, where Mr. Stark and Mr. Smith are explaining their own lives -- over two glasses of Jack Daniels apiece. The very likeable but often cynical Mr. Stark, the son of Art Stark, a television producer who produced NBC's ''The Tonight Show'' until 1969, is divorced and claims he would like to be in a stable relationship with one woman, ''but I've blown so many opportunities.''</p>
        <p>''When I decided to get married it was to the sweetest woman in the world,'' he said. ''There was nothing wrong with her at all. I just got bored and had to blow something up.''</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Smith, the son of a poet and a schoolteacher, who has a calm, contained manner, has been married for 10 years to his ''first love,'' a woman he met 20 years ago in college. They have two young children. ''I think I was very lucky,'' said Mr. Smith of his wife, Virginia Keeny, a civil rights attorney in Los Angeles. ''I found a really special person. I loved her instantly. And I still do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stark said he and Mr. Smith, who have written several movies together but never directed before, rarely argue over personal issues, but they have a longstanding disagreement over people who remain stuck in unhealthy relationships. ''Sean can't understand why supposedly smart people stay in bad relationships,'' he said. ''As someone who has stayed in more than his share of bad relationships for far too long, I don't understand why he can't understand it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith smiled at Mr. Stark indulgently. ''It's not that I don't understand it -- to a point,'' he said. ''It's just that in Anthony's case it seems to go on and on.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stark does not seem to mind such statements, which mirror spirited exchanges between Ben and Adam in ''Into My Heart.'' But perhaps more tellingly, when it comes to his writing partner's long, seemingly idyllic relationship with his wife, Mr. Stark does not seem to harbor the sort of unspoken envy Ben has of Adam.</p>
        <p>''They're like a perfect family,'' Mr. Stark said of Mr. Smith's wife and children. ''But I'm not jealous. I've had a lot of chances but I've blown them and it's almost always my fault. If I can't commit myself, who else is there to blame?''</p>
        <p>So while the contrasting personalities of the two best friends in ''Into My Heart'' eventually lead to tragedy, Mr. Stark and Mr. Smith have managed to profit from their own admittedly ''good cop, bad cop'' friendship by translating it into professional success.</p>
        <p>BOTH men now live in Los Angeles but spent considerable time apart after graduating from high school. Mr. Stark went to Columbia and later studied at the London Film School. Mr. Smith attended Harvard and got his doctorate in modern British history at Stanford. He spent a year supposedly doing doctoral research in London but said he ended up hanging around Mr. Stark in his film classes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smith later moved to Los Angeles, where he waited on tables and worked as a freelance film journalist until Mr. Stark joined him there  and they started collaborating in 1991. After writing what Mr. Smith called ''pretty stupid genre movies'' like ''Dogfighter'' (1996) and ''Art of Murder,'' which will be released straight to video later this year, they decided to write the kind of movie they liked to watch and came up with ''Into My Heart.''</p>
        <p>The script wound up in the hands of Jean Doumanian, the veteran producer of eight Woody Allen movies, when an associate in Los Angeles recommended it to her. Jean Doumanian Productions is opening the movie for a two-week run at the Quad with the intent of getting wider distribution. ''I think it strikes at something universal,'' Ms. Doumanian said. ''When two couples are friendly or double-date I think at one time or another they are attracted to the other. I knew two couples that ended up married to each other's spouses.''</p>
        <p>''Into the Heart,'' however, does not have such a happy ending. In the movie's pivotal scene, Ben, who is by now married himself (his wife is played by Jayne Brook), kisses Adam's wife and sets in motion the smashing of all four lives. Mr. Stark is happy to go on the record and declare that he has never once kissed Mr. Smith's wife. Mr. Smith, for his part, said, ''I wouldn't kill myself if he did, I would kill him.''</p>
        <p>That occasion seems unlikely. After first talking about doing a movie together in high school, Mr. Stark and Mr. Smith have finally gained a foothold in Hollywood and are planning more scripts together as well as solo projects. They are almost done writing their next movie, a comedy that Mr. Smith called ''the best thing we've done so far.''</p>
        <p>While the ending of ''Into My Heart'' is given away in the opening scene, Mr. Stark and Mr. Smith conclude the interview with a twist of their own. When asked if either one can envision doing something as destructive as Ben does, Mr. Stark, the bad cop, immediately says ''No.'' Mr. Smith says ''Yes,'' apparently surprising even himself.</p>
        <p>''I should not have said that,'' he said, laughing. ''Can I take it back?''</p>
