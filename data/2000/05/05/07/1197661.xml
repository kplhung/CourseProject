        <p>Each year, along a particular stretch of the lower Delaware River, the same swirling eddy no bigger than a table top yields my first shad of the season.

        <p>Even though they have stopped feeding, the shad still seem full of aggression, ready to pounce on the red-and-white darts that I cast. Considering that perhaps two months earlier these very fish may have been fattening up in the Bay of Fundy hundreds of miles to the northeast makes such an encounter appear that much more unlikely.</p>
        <p>But it happened again a few weeks ago, when I met Jim Leedom in the early-morning darkness below Lambertville, N.J. Ten years earlier, he and I fished here side by side as strangers.

        <p>Each year, along a particular stretch of the lower Delaware River, the same swirling eddy no bigger than a table top yields my first shad of the season. Like clockwork, after a good April rainstorm raises the river, schools arrive from tidewater on the first leg of their spawning run.</p>
        <p>Even though they have stopped feeding, the shad still seem full of aggression, ready to pounce on the red-and-white darts that I cast. Considering that perhaps two months earlier these very fish may have been fattening up in the Bay of Fundy hundreds of miles to the northeast makes such an encounter appear that much more unlikely.</p>
        <p>But it happened again a few weeks ago, when I met Jim Leedom in the early-morning darkness below Lambertville, N.J. Ten years earlier, he and I fished here side by side as strangers. We took turns drifting darts through the eddy and netted each other's fish. We have since become good friends, and, like the shad, return to the same spot each spring.</p>
        <p>On perhaps my 20th cast, just when I began to think the season might not have started yet, my rod suddenly lurched down river as a shad grabbed the dart and took off. After a few more short runs and a single clean jump, Jim scooped up the fish and handed it off for me to admire. It was a small male -- maybe 2 1/2 pounds, glistening purple and silver against the dark backdrop of the Delaware.</p>
        <p>Two more came from the eddy that day, including a fat roe that I had every intention of keeping. The shad, however, had other plans. It took line slowly at first, then accelerated, and finally hurled itself from the river. My dart landed a good 10 feet away. Jim and I agreed that if there was ever a good way to lose a big shad, we had just seen it.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the bulk of the run will move through the lower river, and the anglers will follow. In early May, most fishers will probably wind up near the Delaware Water Gap, where the river gouged a deep path through ancient bedrock eons ago. Just above the Gap, along the New Jersey side of the river, the channel runs close to the bank, making it a fine spot for shorecasters. On a Saturday morning during the height of the run, particularly if it's rainy or overcast (perfect conditions for good shad fishing), perhaps two dozen anglers may line the river here.</p>
        <p>Farther north, at a pool called Wallpack Bend, Jim will launch his cartop boat and we will drop anchor at the foot of a steep hill lined with hemlocks. Then, we will set out our darts on flatlines and listen for the warblers that by now are flitting through much of the forest canopy.</p>
        <p>Five years ago from this very spot, Jim took a five-pound walleye that must have mistaken his flutter spoon for a small shiner. We still talk about it when the fishing is slow. Other times, heavy shad have kept us busy all day, grabbing our lures and nearly pulling our rods out of the boat.</p>
        <p>By the end of May, if water levels remain normal, anglers begin looking for shad in the upper Delaware, even as far north as the East Branch. This is fly-fishing water, and those willing to strip a fly at breakneck speeds through the right pool can hook dozens in an evening.</p>
        <p>Best of all, most of the fish are spotted first. Place a fly among the right group, and they will chase it down in groups of two or three. The winning fish overtakes the fly, sometimes only a foot or two off the rod tip, gulping it into its maw and turning away in an underwater flash of silver. After dark, schools can be heard chasing each other, boiling on the surface of the river, as the males compete for females.</p>
        <p>Then, suddenly, it's over. By early summer, the shad have finished spawning. Most have died from the act; the few that have not drop back to the ocean. Come August, I will have as much chance of catching a shad in the river as I would a lobster. Like a perfect mayfly hatch, the run lasts long enough to hook a few, but never so long to become easy.</p>
        <p>Which is why shad are among my favorite fish.</p>
