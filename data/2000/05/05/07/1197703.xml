        <p>Gantry Plaza State Park in Long Island City is little-known oasis built on two-acre site along East Riber; parkgoers enjoy serenity it offers, just across river from Manhattan; photo (M)</p>

        <p>The blackened iron gantries once dominated this stretch of Long Island City like mechanical giants, their massive and clanking framework lifting railroad freight cars onto river barges like rocks into a sand pail. Manhattan, like a cool sister, obliviously hummed to its own rhythm across the short span of river.</p>
        <p>The gantries stand silent now, looming more like towering Tonka toys over what has become a post industrial confection. Two years ago, this two-acre site along the East River was turned into a contemplative playground, into a polished cobblestone plaza, into a wood-and-steel temple for sun addicts and stargazers.</p>

        <p>The blackened iron gantries once dominated this stretch of Long Island City like mechanical giants, their massive and clanking framework lifting railroad freight cars onto river barges like rocks into a sand pail. Manhattan, like a cool sister, obliviously hummed to its own rhythm across the short span of river.</p>
        <p>The gantries stand silent now, looming more like towering Tonka toys over what has become a post industrial confection. Two years ago, this two-acre site along the East River was turned into a contemplative playground, into a polished cobblestone plaza, into a wood-and-steel temple for sun addicts and stargazers.</p>
        <p>But shhhhh. Manhattan still sits across the river, and still is oblivious.</p>
        <p>In a city of dwindling secrets, of binocular-toting tourists and space-deprived residents, Gantry Plaza State Park has so far remained an obscure pearl.</p>
        <p>This is something that pleases many people in Long Island City and the surrounding communities of Maspeth and Astoria in Queens and Greenpoint in Brooklyn.</p>
        <p>''We were afraid it would be commercial, with hot dog vendors, and really gaudy,'' said Jonathon Chin, who lives about four blocks away and watched the construction of the park with some trepidation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chin, 29, an unemployed waiter, was poring intently over the employment section of the paper, his situation made a bit more bearable by his sun-washed environs.</p>
        <p>Some park users say they feel they can extend their arms and almost caress the skyscrapers of Manhattan. But Rebecca Ochner, a 10-year-old on spring break, had something else on her mind. She was sitting at a futuristic-looking circular stainless steel picnic bar, her favorite perch, seeking inspiration for a book she is writing on magic.</p>
        <p>''I'm thinking about what Manhattan looked like without all the skyscrapers,'' Rebecca said.</p>
        <p>A Greenpoint resident, she often tags along to the park with her mother's boyfriend, Frank Zito. He comes for the fishing.</p>
        <p>''The park makes an artistic statement,'' said Mr. Zito, a committed angler, examining his bait. ''It's functional with style.''</p>
        <p>On the pier designated for fishing, there is a large free-form steel table with fresh running water for cleaning the catch of the day and a wavy wooden bench that is several yards long.</p>
        <p>Throughout the park, bethabara wood, which is plantation grown and imported from Indonesia, is used. It is not a wood that can be easily carved, but ''Jose &amp; Sarah'' and ''Aleandro y Johanna'' have managed to leave their monikers on the wooden chaise longues.</p>
        <p>On rock-filled paths, there are stone seats and tables that recall the Stone Age. And there are five stainless steel tables for playing chess or checkers. There is no formal garden; instead, native plants and grasses are interspersed throughout.</p>
        <p>On one of the other three piers sat Mariaelena Gutierrez, 23, a marketing associate at a publishing house that recently moved from Manhattan to the neighborhood. She came for a lunch break, a tuna sandwich topped off with chocolate candy.</p>
        <p>''You don't expect much from the area,'' she said. ''But this is a pleasant surprise.''</p>
        <p>Her friend, Tracy Tumminello, also 23, a publishing associate eating with Ms. Gutierrez, was decidedly more enthusiastic. ''You can't get views of Manhattan like this even in Manhattan,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The park was once home to a deserted waterfront train yard and the resting place of broken televisions, ruptured mattresses and rusting cars. Gantry Plaza, which has so far cost $13 million, is Phase 1 of a planned 19-acre, $60 million park. It will stretch along a one-and-a-quarter-mile span of riverbank.</p>
        <p>''It's a 21st-century culture of play that we are all about,'' said Thomas Balsley of Thomas Balsley Associates, who, along with Sowinski Sullivan Architects and Lee Weintraub, designed the plaza. ''It was important that the design be a reflection of the future while being respectful of its past.''</p>
        <p>For visitors like Anthony Roberson, an unemployed Vietnam veteran, the serenity is enough.</p>
        <p>''Here, you don't have the weight of civilization on you,'' said Mr. Roberson, who sat at the far end of the fish-cleaning table listening to jazz.</p>
        <p>Across the water sat Manhattan, still oblivious.</p>
