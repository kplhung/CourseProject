        <p>A PURPLE knit outfit, valued at $238, is left overnight in the dryer at a coin laundry and is gone the next morning. A Chinese restaurant is plagued by ''false and misleading'' takeout orders, all made by the same young man.</p>
        <p>A girl walking home from school sees a swastika carved in the sidewalk, which upon investigation turns out to be a routine surveyor's mark. A toy boat made from a skateboard is missing from a local park. So is a child's gym bag, with a bite plate inside.</p>
        <p>This is what passes for crime here in Hastings-on-Hudson, just a half-hour from midtown Manhattan, and 500 yards from Yonkers, the state's fourth largest city. Despite its proximity to urban blight, its easy access off the Saw Mill River Parkway and the presence of nearly 1,000 troubled youths in five residential institutions in the vicinity, Hastings has the lowest burglary rate in the county.</p>
        <p>To live here is to feel snug when reading the police blotter in the weekly Rivertowns Enterprise. It is to leave the doors unlocked, however foolishly, because of the liberation it brings after years of deadbolts and car alarms. ''It's reassuring when the crimes are so homey,'' said Raymond Seidelman, a professor of political science at nearby Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers.</p>
        <p>Lt. Vincent Schiavone, commander of the 21-member police department, is free of swagger. He is proud that his officers help 200 people a year gain entry to their own homes and cars because they have lost their keys; that they help elderly people who have fallen; that they accept, with straight faces, dubious reports of ''stolen'' golf clubs or antique china right before tax time, when thefts can be claimed as deductions.</p>
        <p>They also soothe the owners of the missing purple outfit, the homemade boat, the bite plate. ''How much of an investigation can you conduct?'' Lieutenant Schiavone asked. ''Do you stake out the place? You just try to reassure them that if it turns up, we'll return it.''</p>
        <p>A common request comes from parents of rowdy teenagers. ''They want us to bring the kids in and just scare them,'' Lieutenant Schiavone said. ''You know how many times I've heard that in 33 years? But we're not in the scaring business.''</p>
        <p>Quite the contrary. Lieutenant Schiavone started a youth division three decades ago, which is now under the gentle hand of Sgt. Dave Bloomer, who befriends struggling  students, keeps in touch with them long after they are grown and encourages them to take the county police exam. It is a cozy life. Sergeant Bloomer, for one, grew up here and sometimes his mother drops off his lunch in a brown paper bag.</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Schiavone is amazed when a reporter comes calling: ''Most people aren't interested because it's too Mayberryish.''</p>
        <p>The exception was two years ago, when the village saw the second homicide in its history, the stabbing of Caroline Costello by her schizophrenic fiance, Michael B. Laudor.</p>
        <p>The streets were clogged with satellite trucks. Journalists tried to sneak past the yellow police tape to interview the neighbors. The phone rang off the hook with photographers asking, ''When's the perp walk?'' One young reporter tried to trick the rube lieutenant into giving him a scoop.</p>
        <p>But Lieutenant Schiavone was not outsmarted. He is an instructor at the Westchester County Police Academy, regularly sends his officers to homicide school, radar school, D.W.I. school, first aid school and firearms training. They have been to seminars on terrorism and hostage situations. But why press his luck?</p>
        <p>As soon as he heard about the killing, Lieutenant Schiavone was on the horn to the Yonkers Police Department. He borrowed four homicide detectives, a forensics expert and a public information officer.</p>
        <p>''I had taken a media relations course in college,'' he said. ''But you have to know your limits. Given the celebrity of the situation, I didn't want to screw things up.''</p>
        <p>This time, the derring-do of the Hastings police department was front page news, and not just in the local weekly. Lieutenant Schiavone's three grown children saved one headline that said, ''Top Cop Investigates Murder.'' It does not hang on his office wall, since it's not the sort of law enforcement he likes best.</p>
        <p>''Most people in big places think what we do is silly,'' he said. ''But I never wanted to do anything but this. We've been doing community policing since time began.''</p>
