        <p>Responding to the numerous protests Cuban-Americans here have mounted since federal agents seized custody of Elian Gonzalez last month, thousands of residents turned out for a demonstration of their own today, lining sidewalks and filling vacant lots in southern Dade County to support the American government.</p>
        <p>The counter-demonstrators, waving American flags and carrying signs reading ''Reno for president,'' said they had been angered and insulted by the way Cuban-Americans had protested the seizure of Elian, 6, from his Miami relatives' home in Little Havana two weeks ago.</p>
        <p>While the sometimes heated protests that greeted the government's action took place largely in Miami proper, today's demonstrations occurred in a conservative area of Miami-Dade County that is home to farms, factories and thousands of whites who feel little affinity for the city. About 20 people displayed Confederate battle flags, but the demonstration also attracted more than 100 blacks.</p>
        <p>Many of the protesters said they had cringed while watching Cuban-Americans burn the American flag and parade it upside down.</p>
        <p>''I have seen the utmost disrespect for this country in the last couple of weeks,'' said Robert Milton, a construction worker from Homestead, a suburb south of Miami. ''It's like these people have forgotten which country took them in and gave them freedom.''</p>
        <p>''I get sick to my stomach,'' he added. ''Someone needs to tell them to show some respect.''</p>
        <p>Some of today's demonstrators, whom the authorities put at more than 5,000, said they were still more angered by the attitudes of local leaders who openly supported Elian's relatives in Miami.</p>
        <p>The family had defied the federal government by refusing to turn over the boy after his father asked that he be returned to his custody in Cuba. They also said they were disgusted at the public squabbling between city officials.</p>
        <p>After the federal raid, Mayor Joe Carollo of Miami denounced the police chief for not telling him in advance about the raid and fired City Manager Donald Warshaw.</p>
        <p>A day later, the police chief, William O'Brien, resigned, saying he wanted no part of Mr. Carollo's administration. Mr. Warshaw remains in office, after a judge temporarily halted his dismissal.</p>
        <p>Demonstrators asserted today that city and county officials had turned their backs on the rest of the community. They carried signs with slogans like ''Crazy Joe must go'' and ''I want a new county.''</p>
        <p>''I'm tired of what is happening in this city,'' said Kristen Markovich, 31, of Perrine, another suburb south of Miami. ''The politicians are making fools of themselves and the rest of us.''</p>
        <p>Demonstrators also accused Cuban-Americans of intimidating anyone who did not share their hatred of Fidel Castro.</p>
        <p>''If you disagree with the majority, you fear for your life, for your family and for your job,'' said Marlene Kay,  of Homestead. ''Freedom of speech doesn't apply in Miami-Dade County anymore.''</p>
        <p>Rick Hartwell, an organizer of the demonstration, said the protesters'  message had been effective, because of the strong turnout.</p>
        <p>''Miami was a one-sided city until now,'' he said.</p>
