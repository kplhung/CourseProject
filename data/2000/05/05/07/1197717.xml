        <p>AS the Yankees' pinstriped voice, Bob Sheppard usually arrives at the Stadium at least two hours before game time. In his public-address announcer's cubicle on the mezzanine level, he goes over the lineups, the proper pronunciation of the names of any new players and whatever special announcements he has to make.</p>
        <p>But not today. Because today is Bob Sheppard Day at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>About half an hour before today's game, the now retired professor of speech at St. John's University, tall and erect at an age he won't discuss, will be honored at a home-plate ceremony in his 50th year of elegant elocution at the big ballpark in the Bronx.</p>
        <p>''I'm delighted,'' he was saying now, ''but I don't know why. All I have is longevity.''</p>
        <p>And all the Yankees have is history. Anybody who has ever been to Yankee Stadium knows that it's more than longevity. It's how he intoned, ''Joe Di-Magg-i-o'' and  ''Mick-ey Man-tle.'' It's what prompted Reggie Jackson, upon joining the Yankees in 1977, to go out of his way to meet him. ''You've got class,'' Mr. October said.</p>
        <p>That class is in the timbre of a voice that his wife, Mary, has described as ''caressing,'' especially in his precise pronunciation.</p>
        <p>''I take great pride,'' he said, ''in how the names are to be pronounced.'' Of the thousands of players' names he has pronounced, he remembered three of his favorites.</p>
        <p>''Shig-e-tosh-i Ha-se-ga-wa,'' he said, slowly and surely. ''Jo-se  Val-di-viel-so. Sal-o-me Bar-o-jas. They're so euphonic.''</p>
        <p>Some names concerned him, notably that of Wayne Terwilliger, an infielder who came through the Stadium with the old Washington Senators and the Kansas City Athletics.</p>
        <p>''I worried that I would say,  'Ter-wigg-ler,' '' Sheppard said, ''but I never did.''</p>
        <p>His style has provoked mimics. Whenever Jackson is at the Stadium, he visits the public-address booth and, in his best imitation, greets the announcer with, ''Good eve-ning, Mis-ter Shepp-ard, wel-come to  Yank-ee Sta-dium.'' Joe Garagiola also echoed him.</p>
        <p>''And Derek Jeter is doing it now,'' Sheppard said.</p>
        <p>In other sports, especially pro basketball, some public-address announcers sound as if they're emceeing a wrestling show, shouting loudly and dragging out a name as if it were a drum roll.</p>
        <p>''I just try to be clear, concise and correct,'' Sheppard said. ''I don't change my pattern. I speak at Yankee Stadium the same way I do in a classroom, a saloon, or reading the Gospel at Mass at St. Christopher's.''</p>
        <p>When he announces the lineups now, he sounds the same as he did that April day in 1951 when he worked his first Yankee game.</p>
        <p>''Johnny Mize was the first baseman,'' he remembered, ''Jerry Coleman was at second, Phil Rizzuto at shortstop, Billy Johnson at third, Jackie Jensen in left field, Joe DiMaggio in center field, Mickey Mantle in right field, Yogi Berra catching, Vic Raschi pitching. We beat the Red Sox and I got through it without any gliches.''</p>
        <p>But he has had an occasional glitch.</p>
        <p>After working a Yankee game one afternoon, Sheppard hurried over to Giants Stadium (he's done Giants games since 1956) and said, ''Good evening, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Yankee Stadium.'' At halftime of an Army-Navy game in Philadelphia during John F. Kennedy's administration, he informed the crowd that the president was about to go from the Army side to the Navy side.</p>
        <p>''It was cold,'' he recalled, ''but the president was only wearing a business suit. I told one of my spotters, 'He doesn't even have a topcoat on.' I didn't realize my microphone was on. Everybody in the stadium heard it.''</p>
        <p>His microphone should always be on. At St. John's coming commencement, he will receive an honorary degree as a Doctor of Pedagogy. In his translation, that means master teacher, as any Yankee fan will attest.</p>
        <p>Once a St. John's quarterback, he was playing semipro football on Long Island when he offered to be the p.a. announcer for a pro football exhibition game at Freeport Stadium. That led to his announcing the pro football Brooklyn Dodgers' games, then those of the pro football Yankees in the old All-America Conference.</p>
        <p>''Later on, I did the New York Titans at the Polo Grounds,'' he said of that early American Football League franchise known for its lack of cash flow. ''I never got paid.''</p>
        <p>Now in his 50th season on the Yankees' payroll, he has never missed a game because of illness. ''Weddings, births, family parties,'' he said, ''I've missed a few games for those reasons.'' And he'll miss today's game. After the ceremony, his longtime backup, Jim Hall, will be the p.a. announcer.</p>
        <p>Bob Shepp-ard has the rest of the af-ter-noon off.</p>
