        <p>WHITE PLAINS is a city with just one supermarket, but every year dozens of shopping carts wind up abandoned in vacant lots and along city streets.</p>
        <p>''It would be an understatement to say they make life more difficult for us,'' said Joseph J. Nicoletti Jr., the city's commissioner of public works.</p>
        <p>White Plains collects the carts and sells them back to their rightful owners, making enough to cover the cost of retrieval.</p>
        <p>A city ordinance says that carts become city property if abandoned on a public right of way. The city then notifies the markets (mostly in neighboring Greenburgh, North White Plains and Hartsdale) that their carts have turned up. And they tell the stores that they can have them back for $20 to $35 each, depending on their condition.</p>
        <p>''If we sell back 100 shopping carts a year, we make about $3,000, which offsets our costs for picking them up,'' Mr. Nicoletti said. ''It's not a money maker for us. We have no choice, though, but to collect them, because mountains of carts all over the city would be a real hazard.</p>
        <p>''Besides, at less than $50 a cart for the ones in fair or good condition, they're a bargain; the replacement cost is about $600 each.''</p>
        <p>Heavily damaged carts -- rusted and without wheels -- are auctioned off once a year. On April 7 the city sold 190 of them to a city employee, Manuel Velasquez, for a total bid of $27.</p>
        <p>''Maybe the person that purchased them crushed them and sold them as scrap metal for $50,'' Mr. Nicoletti said. ''But it would have cost the city hundreds of dollars to go that route.''</p>
        <p>By contrast, Greenburgh is weighing a law to fine those who pilfer carts.</p>
        <p>The proposed law stipulates that all stores must display a warning sign that unauthorized removal of a cart violates town law. Furthermore, store owners must put identifying markers on each cart.</p>
        <p>Under the law, the town will be able to charge $35 for picking up and returning a cart. It would also be able to fine those who walk off with the carts up to $100.</p>
        <p>All new stores in Greenburgh would be required to equip shopping carts with electronic mechanisms that would cause the wheels to lock if the cart left the premises. Ms. Mancuso likened the devices to invisible electronic fences that are used to keep dogs from straying. Such a system would cost about $20,000 for a store with 150 carts, Paul J.Feiner, the Town Supervisor, estimated.</p>
