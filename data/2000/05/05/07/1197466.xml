        <p>EIGHT people stand in two rows, heads back, eyes tightly closed. ''Siente el sol,'' someone says -- ''You're feeling the sun.'' ''Estan en Colombia. En Peru'' -- ''You're in Colombia. In Peru.'' ''Respira profundo.'' --  ''Breathe deeply.''</p>
        <p>One man lies on his back. A 12-year-old girl follows suit. Eventually, everyone is lying down, apparently sunbathing. Except that they are not in Peru or Colombia. There is no sun. It is not even warm.</p>
        <p>It is 6:30 on a cold, dreary Sunday evening in April in Port Chester. But that doesn't matter to these people. They can visualize. They are actors.</p>
        <p>Specifically, they are members of Origenes, the first Spanish-language theater group in Westchester, and they are warming up before rehearsing for their next presentation, ''El Cubiche en la Luna'' (''The Cuban in the Moon.'')</p>
        <p>Origenes was founded by Jose Costa, an instructor in computers and English as a second language for the Southern Westchester Board of Cooperative Educational Services. Mr. Costa, who teaches both children and adults, started Origenes (Origins) in December 1998, because he thought Spanish-speaking people needed a place ''where we could express our knowledge of the theater and where people could get more confidence.''</p>
        <p>Origenes has already mounted four productions, two for adults and two for children.</p>
        <p>Meeting on Tuesday and Sunday evenings, the participants bring a range of  experience and talent.</p>
        <p>There is Lisette Oblitas, from Peru, a Port Chester High School student who always wanted to act; Eucario Foronda, an outgoing young man from Colombia who gives Spanish lessons; Mariscelly Ospina, a Manhattanville College student, also from Colombia, who teaches computer to other young people; and Jose Garcia, born in the United States of Puerto Rican parents, who went to an Origenes meeting after reading about it and found himself appearing in public four days later.</p>
        <p>And there is Josue Recinos, a shy young man whose journey out of Guatemala began with a job as a busboy on an American cruise ship; Virna Lopez, who acted frequently in Colombia; Sandra Garcia, from  Puerto Rico, who came to help with directing; and Manuel Defreitas, who had acted in Peru through school, Boy Scouts and even in college.</p>
        <p>They are led by Mr. Costa and Jorge Joanen, who learned about the group from a flier at his church. Mr. Joanen, who had studied acting and run a professional theater group in his native Argentina, tried to join a group in Manhattan about 10 years ago but was deterred because ''my English was poor and I had no time to rehearse.''</p>
        <p>These days he has even less. He is a Mamaroneck resident, the father of two and the owner of his own painting business, and he is carrying six courses at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry. He does his homework at 2 a.m. and still drives his sons to soccer and football practices. He also makes time for the group's Sunday night meetings and is assistant director for one of the two short plays Origenes will present in June.</p>
        <p>Mr. Costa has also studied theater and acted professionally -- before working as a Lima bank manager. When he arrived in the United States in 1990 at 35, he had planned to study for a master's degree in business administration, but he could not afford the tuition. He worked for a year as a waiter at the Round Hill Club in Greenwich for $10 an hour, plus room and board, and studied communications and computer at Norwalk Community College. Afterward, he operated a computer school in White Plains for five years, which led him to a job with the Board of Cooperative Educational Services in Port Chester.</p>
        <p>He soon realized that he loved teaching.</p>
        <p>As he worked with immigrants from all over the world, Mr. Costa began to speculate about the ways a Spanish-language theater group might help some of his students.  Besides building confidence and offering an outlet for expression to people who struggled all day in an unfamiliar language, it could provide Hispanic immigrants with an opportunity to display their culture to the larger community and remind children about their heritage.</p>
        <p>He discussed the idea with Camille Linen, a colleague at the board who was also the education director for Port Chester's Community Arts Center. ''Jose had an idea and we have a space and so it happened,'' Ms. Linen said. The arts center rents most of the Castle, a vaulted stone building on the grounds of St. Peter's Episcopal Church here. Their space includes the parish hall, a gymnasium-size room with a stage with a curtain and lighting equipment, which was perfect for Origenes.</p>
        <p>To found the group, Mr. Costa enlisted a few of his adult computer students, including Carlos Moran, of Port Chester, also the father of two, who had immigrated from Ecuador 16 years ago. ''We try to do a lot of plays with kids and educate the community that there are not only bars to go to but plays to go to and learn from,'' he said.</p>
        <p>They ran an advertisement in Westchester Latino, a Spanish language newspaper, and distributed fliers to schools, laundries, churches and stores in Mamaroneck, Mount Kisco and Port Chester. Since then the group has grown by word of mouth and exposure to their productions.</p>
        <p>Scheduled for June 9 and 10, their next presentation is a pair of short plays.</p>
        <p>''Cubiche en la Luna'' (''The Cuban in the Moon'') by Ivan Acosta, has become unexpectedly relevant: it portrays a group of Cubans trying to leave Cuba. They flee to the moon instead of the United States, but after they arrive they become political pawns, fought over by American astronauts and Russian cosmonauts.</p>
        <p>The other play, ''La Frontera (The Border)'' was offered to Origenes by Barbara Quintero, a Katonah playwright with Hispanic roots, who had read about the group.  Ms. Quintero's play, which was written in English and had been performed at Sing Sing prison in Ossining, depicts Mexicans  illegally trying to cross the Texas border.  Mr. Costa translated it into Spanish, and when Ms. Quintero attended a rehearsal she was thrilled even though she is not fluent in Spanish.</p>
        <p>Gregarious or shy, educated or simply upwardly mobile, Origenes's members find themselves changed by their work in the group. For Mr. Costa, it has transformed his version of the American dream. ''I came here to make money,'' he said. ''I wanted to be an entrepreneur and have my own business. But since I've worked at BOCES I found that making money was not the thing that filled me up. It's the smile that appears on someone's face when I work with them.  Or saying, 'You can do it. You can do it. You  can do it,' and seeing it work.''</p>
        <p>He continued: ''Someone recently said to me, 'Aren't you tired with all you do?' And I said, 'No. Whether it's acting or computer or whatever, they share with me their experiences. They fill me up with their energy.''</p>
