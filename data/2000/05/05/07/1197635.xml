        <p>IT was David Hellier's turn to ask a question. As vice president for marketing at Ask Jeeves Inc., an Internet question-and-answer service, Mr. Hellier was holding a media planning session and wanted to hear ideas on spreading the word about the company.</p>
        <p>The answer, perhaps inevitably, was more questions. Why not pose various puzzlers to consumers, to make them want to turn to the Ask Jeeves service? Then the idea took what could be called an apples-and-oranges turn.</p>

        <p>IT was David Hellier's turn to ask a question. As vice president for marketing at Ask Jeeves Inc., an Internet question-and-answer service, Mr. Hellier was holding a media planning session and wanted to hear ideas on spreading the word about the company.</p>
        <p>The answer, perhaps inevitably, was more questions. Why not pose various puzzlers to consumers, to make them want to turn to the Ask Jeeves service? Then the idea took what could be called an apples-and-oranges turn.</p>
        <p>In supermarket produce aisles across the country, shoppers can pick up apples, oranges and, soon, bananas, and find questions like these printed on tiny stickers affixed to the fruit: ''How do I make homemade applesauce?'' ''What rhymes with orange?'' and ''How many calories in a banana?'' The Askjeeves.com address is also on the sticker.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hellier said the advertising agency for Ask Jeeves, DSW Partners in Salt Lake City, ''put us together'' with the Fruit Label Company of Los Angeles, and the campaign began in November. First, there were stickers on 15 million apples. Oranges came next, in March. A new campaign, with 12 different questions slipped onto the peels of 100 million Dole bananas, will start soon.</p>
        <p>''The fruit companies like Dole see it as an opportunity, because our Web site is No. 14 in popularity on the Internet,'' Mr. Hellier said. ''And we were already linking consumers to growers to answer questions about health and nutrition.''</p>
        <p>He said it would probably be impossible to measure the campaign's effect on fruit sales. But he did say that consumers seemed to be asking Jeeves more questions about fruit these days.</p>
        <p>Where will the labels go next? Maybe on a vegetable. ''We haven't figured that one out yet,'' he said. ''We're thinking about packaged salads.''</p>
