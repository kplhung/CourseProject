        <p>On May 17, visitors to the Field Museum in Chicago will have a chance to meet Sue, the largest, most complete and best preserved Tyrannosaurus rex ever found.</p>
        <p>About 67 million years ago, Sue stood more than 13 feet tall and roamed the Black Hills of South Dakota. The seven-ton reptile had serrated teeth that were up to a foot long. She measured 42 feet from her snout to the tip of her tail and has a skull that is 5.2 feet long and weighs 750 pounds.</p>

        <p>On May 17, visitors to the Field Museum in Chicago will have a chance to meet Sue, the largest, most complete and best preserved Tyrannosaurus rex ever found.</p>
        <p>About 67 million years ago, Sue stood more than 13 feet tall and roamed the Black Hills of South Dakota. The seven-ton reptile had serrated teeth that were up to a foot long. She measured 42 feet from her snout to the tip of her tail and has a skull that is 5.2 feet long and weighs 750 pounds.</p>
        <p>Over millions of years, Sue fossilized so perfectly that most of her more than 250 bones have been found, and it is still possible to see where muscles, tendons and other soft tissues were once attached. Sue remained hidden in western South Dakota until Aug. 20, 1990, when Sue Hendrickson (after whom the T. rex is named), a fossil hunter, discovered her.</p>
        <p>In celebration of Sue's arrival, the museum is playing host to a series of opening-day and weekend educational programs including Create-a-Saurus, where visitors can build dinosaurs using foam and wire; Dino-Time for preschoolers; a  musical premiere; and film presentations (accompanying the exhibits) with dinosaur themes.</p>
        <p>Sue's skull will be on display on a second-floor balcony (it is too heavy to fit onto the assembled skeleton), and visitors can get a close look at it. Nearby will be touchable casts of Sue's teeth, of the tip of her tail, of one of her forelimbs and of her wishbone; interactive Web stations, and a room dedicated to dinosaur facts and theories. For example, it is known that Sue has two forelimbs with ''hands,'' but scientists don't know what they were used for or what color they were.</p>
        <p>While her real skeleton (with a lighter version of her skull) will remain at the Field Museum permanently, two full-size cast models will tour the country this summer, starting in Honolulu at the Bishop Museum and in Boston at the Museum of Science.</p>
        <p>The Field Museum, 1400 South Lake Shore Drive, is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily except Christmas and New Year's Day.  Admission is $8, $4 for ages 3 to 11, students with ID and seniors. Free on Wednesdays. Call (312) 922-9410.</p>
