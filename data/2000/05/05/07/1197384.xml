        <p>The people who come in to the psychiatrist's office mustn't get the wrong idea of what it's all about. Even if you feel at home there, it's not a home, because it's all being paid for. So the tie or the earrings the analyst wears, the color of the carpet, the pictures on the wall -- these are all messages. And yet, as the psychiatrist should be the first to acknowledge, we never know exactly what messages we are sending, or indeed how they will be received. The books and journals that so often furnish a consulting room may be meant to suggest a studious commitment to the work; to the patient they may speak rather eloquently of a fear of sex, or a need to be taken seriously. However silent the psychiatrist prefers to be, her room speaks for her; and whatever the patient may or may not say about it, it is furnished with clues.</p>
        <p>But what connection is there between a room and the kind of conversation you can have in it? The psychiatrist's problem is that, apart from his couch and his chairs and his body, there isn't much to go on. He is selling something, but it's not easy to advertise. Neither a showroom nor an artist's studio, the psychiatrist's office is more like a stage set waiting for its drama. The psychiatrist has already designed the set and chosen the props; but absurdly, neither he nor the patient know what the play will be.</p>

        <p>The people who come in to the psychiatrist's office mustn't get the wrong idea of what it's all about. Even if you feel at home there, it's not a home, because it's all being paid for.

        <p>But what connection is there between a room and the kind of conversation you can have in it? The psychiatrist's problem is that, apart from his couch and his chairs and his body, there isn't much to go on. He is selling something, but it's not easy to advertise. Neither a showroom nor an artist's studio, the psychiatrist's office is more like a stage set waiting for its drama. The psychiatrist has already designed the set and chosen the props; but absurdly, neither he nor the patient know what the play will be.</p>
        <p>The offices (all of them in New York) that appear in these photographs allude to the kind of drama the psychiatrist would prefer it to be. You don't put out Ming vases if you're expecting violence. Paintings on the wall say that here, art is valued. (And here, valuing things is valued.) And yet despite the infinite reassurances of opulent furniture and the bracing asceticism of bare rooms, ambiguity rules. What is it about black leather that makes it so often the upholstery of choice? Indeed, the real drama of these rooms -- a drama that goes on even when they are empty -- is the way they try to resolve the uncertainty of the psychiatrist's enterprise.</p>
        <p>Only in carefully furnished rooms like these can people who no longer have shrines to visit, who find themselves caught in the modern conflict between comfort, convention and honesty, go to satisfy an appetite to become more like the people they want to be.</p>
