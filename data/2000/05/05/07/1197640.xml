        <p>Pratt Institute urban design Prof Richard Scherr letter on David Dunlap's April 16 article on massive NYC billboards disputes comments by Van Alen Institute executive director Raymond Gastil (S)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>David W. Dunlap's fine article on the giant wall advertisements (''Your Ad Here'' April 16) was a fair discussion of the advertising controversy. However, the comments by Raymond Gastil, executive director of the Van Alen Institute,  (''a new opportunity for communication . . . 'Blade Runner Comes Alive' '') were troubling. While trendy, the comment misses the critical point, that these over-scaled private signs overwhelm the presence of the city's rich and complex public culture, which can't afford the same space, and are further smothered under the blanket of mass commercialization. And by being placed virtually everywhere, these signs threaten the city's greatest quality as a collection of unique places that express difference. New forms of communication are fine -- but the message has become depressingly the same.</p>
