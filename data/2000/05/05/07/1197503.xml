        <p>In the Princeton real estate market, pleading cannot hurt. When David Campbell and Amanda Rose saw a house they wanted a few weeks ago, listed at $239,000, they enclosed in their sealed bid a letter and a picture of their year-old daughter.</p>
        <p>They won the competition, with an offer of $250,000, after months of watching prices rise and preparing to pounce. ''It was clear that if waited we might not get this house,'' Ms. Rose said, ''and there might not be any other house.''</p>

        <p>In the Princeton real estate market, pleading cannot hurt. When David Campbell and Amanda Rose saw a house they wanted a few weeks ago, listed at $239,000, they enclosed in their sealed bid a letter and a picture of their year-old daughter.</p>
        <p>They won the competition, with an offer of $250,000, after months of watching prices rise and preparing to pounce. ''It was clear that if waited we might not get this house,'' Ms. Rose said, ''and there might not be any other house.''</p>
        <p>And so another house departed the superheated housing market here, where the general rule these days is that if you see anything advertised, it has already been sold. Real estate agents and buyers describe bidding wars -- four or five offers is not uncommon -- with mortgage contingencies scratched. Their best guesses are that prices have risen by a third since last summer.</p>
        <p>''We're hotter than any other market in New Jersey,'' said Catherine McCool, the manager of the Gloria Nilson real estate office in Princeton. Ms. McCool measures the heat by the number of buyers lined up; she estimates that the traffic in her office has quintupled in three or four years.</p>
        <p>Peter Blicher, president of the Central Jersey Builders Association, measures the heat by the multiple-listings book for Mercer County.</p>
        <p>Searching for a ruler during a telephone interview, Mr. Blicher said: ''A year ago it was probably two inches thick. It's now less than an inch.''</p>
        <p>To be sure, Princeton is not the only frenzied market. While the median price of existing homes across the state has been roughly in line with the inflation rate -- the New Jersey Association of Realtors reported an increase to $166,800 last year from $162,400 in 1998 -- there are plenty of hot spots.</p>
        <p>Timothy Richards, president-elect of the Realtors association, said prices were shooting up in pockets of Bergen, Monmouth, Morris and Essex counties, too. ''The baby boomers are out there buying their buns off,'' Mr. Richards said.</p>
        <p>In Princeton, as in most places, the lower and middle ranges is where the pain is, said Robin L. Wallack, a broker with Nilson.</p>
        <p>But here, ''middle range'' means $400,000 to $700,000. Ms. Wallack said it had probably been a year since she heard of anything under $100,000, and the current listings, slim as they are, show a healthy bulge over $1 million.</p>
        <p>''That's about the going rate for bigger houses near the university,'' Ms. Wallack said as she pointed out some recently sold properties. One of them, a well-kept ranch house on a half-acre, brought more than $500,000. It is now back on the market, offered by a builder with plans to demolish it and build a new one for $1.3 million.</p>
        <p>''I've seen a lot of comings and goings,'' she said, ''but I've never seen a market like this, ever.''</p>
        <p>And a million dollars cannot buy most of the new houses rising in northwestern Princeton Township, a kind of woodsy frontier where a few dozen buildable lots have been carved out. Of the few remaining, a four-acre parcel off Drakes Corner Road is listed at $639,000; a four-acre lot closer to town is listed at $795,000.</p>
        <p>''Lots in the Princeton area have probably gone up $100,000 in the last six months,'' said Mr. Blicher, whose company, Westrum-Pennington Properties, is finishing a development in Hopewell Township where prices start in the$600,000's. ''I have to look anywhere in the state just to find property to build on.''</p>
        <p>Tom Vogt, a molecular biology professor, said he and his wife were ''awestruck'' by the prices but bought a one-acre lot in Princeton Township last year for $350,000 -- and then watched prices rise around them. Now they are designing a house while living in their university apartment, though Mr. Vogt acknowledges that like everyone else in Princeton he is unable to stop watching the market.</p>
        <p>''It's gotten to the point where people are ringing doorbells, saying, 'I'd buy your house if you'd sell it,' '' he said. He mentioned a street in his neighborhood where houses that sold for $500,000 two years ago were bringing $780,000. ''Friends of ours there were delighted to hear us regale them with stories about prices,'' he added.</p>
        <p>For Ms. Rose, a graduate student at Rutgers, and Mr. Campbell, who teaches at the College of Staten Island, buying was a quick march -- though their transaction was a little slow by Princeton standards. ''We started looking on a Thursday,'' Ms. Rose said. ''My husband saw the house Friday, I saw it Saturday, on Monday morning we put in a bid, and on Tuesday it was accepted.''</p>
        <p>Debbie and Ed Soffen claimed their new house within a day -- a day they had begun with no intention of buying anything.</p>
        <p>The Soffens, both doctors, have lived in Princeton for nine years, and wanting to stay in their neighborhood, bought a small house on a large lot two years ago with a rather leisurely plan to replace the house with a bigger one.</p>
        <p>As of a month ago, they were working with an architect to design the new house when they received a call: a house on Carnegie Lake, where they had always wanted to live, was going on the market. When they saw it, they decided to buy before they walked out the door.</p>
        <p>''When I was trying to describe the house to the insurance company, I couldn't quite remember,'' Mr. Soffen said. ''They were asking, 'Well, what's it made of? What are the floors made of?' I hadn't been in it long enough.''</p>
        <p>Within two weeks, their first house was sold. They plan to list the second soon. ''We wanted to do it one at a time to keep it a little sane,'' Ms. Soffen said.</p>
        <p>At real estate agencies, ''agents used to check the computer once a day,'' said Anne Kearns, manager of the Prudential Fox &amp; Roach office in Princeton. ''Now we're checking every hour, every half-hour.''</p>
        <p>Even if the stock market falters, real estate experts say, the corporate expansions and the local start-ups under way around Princeton seem to dictate a longer life for the longest and strongest market ever.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blicher, predicting that new construction could not ease a statewide housing shortage any time soon, added that prices were shooting up especially fast here ''because Princeton is just so desirable.''</p>
        <p>And there will always be a Princeton. For decades, the town has generated stories of the quest for a place in the right ZIP code (that would be 08540 or 08542) and even waiting lists for a post office box within. And in the current issue of Town Topics, a long, loving ad for a $575,000 ranch house end with a common consolation prize: ''In Lawrence Township, with a Princeton address.''</p>
