        <p>THE city has a small-town feeling in a photograph by Larry Racioppo (above) showing a Memorial Day ceremony in 1998 at Rockaway Beach Boulevard and Beach 129th Street. The image is from Mr. Racioppo's Rockaway series, which along with his Good Friday series is part of ''A Vision of the Street: New York City Photographs,'' a retrospective of more than 60 of Mr. Racioppo's photos at Queens College. The images range from small black-and-white prints of Mr. Racioppo's family to large color panoramas of sprawling urban landscapes. Mr. Racioppo was born and raised in South Brooklyn, lives in Belle Harbor, Queens, and has photographed his city since 1970. He said of the exhibition: ''It is really a look at the city and how the city has changed over the years I have been photographing it. Some of the images are of places I have returned to after 20 years; I am still interested in the same places and things.''</p>
