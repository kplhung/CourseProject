        <p>Judge Norma Holloway Johnson, the chief federal trial judge in Washington, has hired a lawyer to represent her before judicial and Congressional inquiries into why she assigned several criminal cases involving President Clinton's associates to judges Mr. Clinton had appointed.</p>
        <p>The first act of the lawyer, Michael Madigan, in representing Judge Johnson was to tell a Republican-led Congressional investigation that his client would decline to testify at any Congressional committee hearing into her behavior. Mr. Madigan, an experienced Washington lawyer, was last in the spotlight as chief counsel to the investigation by Senator Fred Thompson, Republican of Tennessee, of possible fund-raising irregularities in the Democratic Party.</p>
        <p>In a letter to Representative Dan Burton, the Indiana Republican who is the chairman of the House Committee on Government Reform, Mr. Madigan said that Judge Johnson of Federal District Court, would decline the invitation to testify before Congress.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Madigan said it would be unprecedented for a sitting judge to be questioned by Congress about such an issue: ''We have the greatest respect for Congress but the constitutional issues of separation of powers are just too great.''</p>
        <p>The issue stems from complaints by Republican members of Congress that Judge Johnson bypassed the usual computer-operated system that randomly assigns cases to trial judges under her for a handful of cases. Those cases involved Webster L. Hubbell, an Arkansas friend of the Clintons and former senior Justice Department official and Charlie Yah Lin Trie, a fund-raiser for the president. Judge Johnson assigned those and some other criminal cases involving associates of Mr. Clinton to four judges he named to the bench.</p>
        <p>In response, the governing body of the local federal judicial circuit named a panel of five judges to look into the charges. The panel, in turn, recently hired Joe D. Whitley, an Atlanta lawyer and former official in the Justice Department under Republican presidents, to conduct its investigation.</p>
        <p>In his letter to Mr. Burton, Mr. Madigan gave some indication of what his approach would be in defending Judge Johnson before the special judicial panel. He said that the practice of going off the random assignment system and handpicking judges in ''certain kinds of cases'' had been in effect for many years. He cited a policy adopted in 1971 by then-Chief Justice Warren Burger allowing for complex cases to be assigned outside the random system. That method was used, he noted, in cases involving the Watergate and Iran-contra scandals.</p>
