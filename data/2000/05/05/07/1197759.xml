        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Hooray to New York City's interim schools chancellor, Harold O. Levy, for sending out Wallace Stevens poems to the members of the Board of Education (front page, May 2), and for arranging encounters for superintendents and others with Isaac Stern and big ideas in fields like American history and cosmology.</p>
        <p>Maybe the great poet is right who tells us that poetry makes nothing happen. And surely the chancellor must also deal efficiently with important matters like improving low skills and creating decent summer schools.</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Hooray to New York City's interim schools chancellor, Harold O. Levy, for sending out Wallace Stevens poems to the members of the Board of Education (front page, May 2), and for arranging encounters for superintendents and others with Isaac Stern and big ideas in fields like American history and cosmology.</p>
        <p>Maybe the great poet is right who tells us that poetry makes nothing happen. And surely the chancellor must also deal efficiently with important matters like improving low skills and creating decent summer schools.</p>
        <p>But how refreshing to see a top New York administrator signal everyone involved -- from elected officials and administrators to teachers and children -- to the need to stay in daily touch with the other basics in education: imagination, passion, thoughtfulness, conversation and, in the writer Eleanor Duckworth's lovely phrase, ''the having of wonderful ideas.''</p>
        <p>JOSEPH FEATHERSTONE  East Lansing, Mich., May 2, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is a poet and faculty leader in the teacher education program at Michigan State University.</p>
