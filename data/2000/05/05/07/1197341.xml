        <p>Q: We received a notice from the board of a co-op where we own an apartment that we have sublet to a tenant for 12 years. The notice informed us that at a regular meeting of the board it was decided that all owners must terminate all existing subleases, subtenancies and other nonshareholder occupancies by Dec. 31. It further stated that all persons who purchase apartments after March 1, 2000, shall reside in their apartment and that the board will not consider or approve any application to sublease an apartment.</p>
        <p>Isn't it necessary for such changes to be made by changing the bylaws with two-thirds of the owners approving?</p>

        <p>Q: We received a notice from the board of a co-op where we own an apartment that we have sublet to a tenant for 12 years. The notice informed us that at a regular meeting of the board it was decided that all owners must terminate all existing subleases, subtenancies and other nonshareholder occupancies by Dec. 31. It further stated that all persons who purchase apartments after March 1, 2000, shall reside in their apartment and that the board will not consider or approve any application to sublease an apartment.</p>
        <p>Isn't it necessary for such changes to be made by changing the bylaws with two-thirds of the owners approving?</p>
        <p>Also, one member of the board has been trying to buy my apartment in order to enlarge his premises. Is it not utterly inappropriate for this director to be a decisionmaker in this ruling when he has been pushing for this to happen for his own personal reasons? . . . Shirley Yules, Manhattan.  A: Aaron Shmulewitz, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that under the standard proprietary-lease provision regarding subletting, a board has the right to regulate the duration of subletting and to institute a minimum residency requirement that must be met before an apartment can be sublet.</p>
        <p>However, Mr. Shmulewitz said, a board generally cannot impose a blanket ban on all prospective subletting without the specific authority to do so being contained in the proprietary lease. Without such a provision, he said, an amendment to the lease would likely be required before the board could impose an outright ban on subletting.</p>
        <p>And while most bylaws require the approval vote of at least 67 percent of the owners of the co-op's shares to amend the proprietary lease, some bylaws require a higher percentage and some require only a simple majority vote.</p>
        <p>Accordingly, Mr. Shmulewitz said, the letter writer should review the proprietary lease -- as well as the co-op's bylaws -- to determine whether they contain provisions that differ from the standard ones.</p>
        <p>Finally, he said, if a board member has expressed a clear intention to purchase the letter writer's apartment, that board member should refrain from voting at a board meeting on the issue of imposing a blanket ban on subletting.</p>
        <p>Since such a ban would make it more likely that the letter writer would be forced to sell her apartment, Mr. Shmulewitz said, the board member could appear to have a conflict of interest.</p>
        <p>Replacing A Countertop</p>
        <p>Q: I live in a rent-stabilized apartment. The side-splash of our kitchen counter has become very loose. The superintendent has fixed it a few times, but when I called him to repair it again, he said he could not repair it and that I should request a new countertop. However, the managing agent said that if the countertop was to be replaced, my rent would increase. I have never heard of an increase for having a countertop replaced. Is this true? . . . Marcella MacDonald, Manhattan.  A: Thomas Higgins, a Manhattan landlord-tenant lawyer, said that the rent increase referred to by the managing agent is apparently a capital-improvement increase, sometimes called an individual-apartment increase, that a landlord would be entitled to after making an improvement to an apartment.</p>
        <p>Under the Rent Stabilization Law, Mr. Higgins explained, a property owner is permitted to increase a tenant's rent permanently by 1/40th of the cost of such an improvement.</p>
        <p>However, Mr. Higgins said, it is unlikely that the replacement of a broken kitchen countertop would be the type of improvement that would entitle a landlord to a rent increase.</p>
        <p>''The landlord has an obligation to maintain the premises in good condition and cannot diminish the services being provided,'' he said, adding that since replacing the countertop would more likely be considered a repair than an improvement, it would not serve as the basis for a capital-improvement increase.</p>
