        <p>WHEN Budd Schulberg dreamed up Sam my Glick  the ultimate Hollywood wheeler-dealer, ''a little ferret of a kid, sharp and quick'' -- back in the 1930's, he meant his novel, ''What Makes Sammy Run?,'' to be seen in part as a cautionary tale. Back then, Sammy Glick was the villain of the piece, the awful example of what might happen if you let individualism and free enterprise run away with you. Yes, Sammy was a product of his environment (''in the midst of a war that was selfish, ruthless and cruel, Sammy was proving himself the fittest, the fiercest and the fastest'') and perhaps readers did pity him, a bit.

        <p>Not until the 1970's did Mr. Schulberg notice the beginnings of a ''180-degree turn in our national attitude toward Sammy.''

''The book I had written as an angry expose of Sammy Glick was becoming a character reference,'' Mr. Schulberg wrote. He remembered one student telling him how much he admired Sammy Glick's ruthless rise to the top.

        <p>WHEN Budd Schulberg dreamed up Sam my Glick  the ultimate Hollywood wheeler-dealer, ''a little ferret of a kid, sharp and quick'' -- back in the 1930's, he meant his novel, ''What Makes Sammy Run?,'' to be seen in part as a cautionary tale. Back then, Sammy Glick was the villain of the piece, the awful example of what might happen if you let individualism and free enterprise run away with you. Yes, Sammy was a product of his environment (''in the midst of a war that was selfish, ruthless and cruel, Sammy was proving himself the fittest, the fiercest and the fastest'') and perhaps readers did pity him, a bit. But they definitely did not want to be him.</p>
        <p>Not until the 1970's did Mr. Schulberg notice the beginnings of a ''180-degree turn in our national attitude toward Sammy.'' By 1989, when he wrote an afterword to a new paperback edition of the novel, the author noted that Sammy's rap was being heard much differently by the young faces he saw in the college classes he addressed. ''The book I had written as an angry expose of Sammy Glick was becoming a character reference,'' Mr. Schulberg wrote. He remembered one student telling him how much he admired Sammy Glick's ruthless rise to the top. ''He put out his hand, the hand that would soon be knifing friends and colleagues in the back,'' Mr. Schulberg wrote. ''As I took it hesitantly, I asked myself, What have I done?''</p>
        <p>If anything, Mr. Schulberg said, the 11 years between writing that afterword and today have been even more disheartening. Back then, the young Sammy Glicks he encountered would acknowledge that, yes, of course, they understood the irony of admiring a character as despicable as Sammy. ''But today, I don't think they'd even be aware of it,'' Mr. Schulberg said in a recent interview. ''This new generation has absolutely no consideration of such matters. It's another world. They appear to feel that any kind of moral brakes on what you do seem old-fashioned or out of date or even nonexistent. I don't think they even think about it. I don't think they even worry about it. I think, in a sense, they see themselves as super Sammys.''</p>
        <p>Sammy Glick is merely the most vivid and persistent example of what has become over the last 75 years one of the stock characters in American popular culture -- the Hollywood wheeler-dealer. The history of this character extends back to the earliest days of the movie business right through Sammy and up to the current, digital era. Though not as ubiquitous as such other stock types as the rugged loner, the wacky dame or the wronged man seeking vengeance, like them, this feral Hollywood character keeps popping up through the decades, wearing different hats to reflect different moral attitudes but always recognizably the same: ruthless, power-hungry, egomaniacal and hedonistic.</p>
        <p>But while America's attitude toward its other stock types has remained fairly consistent, its relationship to this Hollywood figure has gone through a transformation over the years, telling us something not only about America's moral fluctuation but also about the way Hollywood views itself. It can hardly be coincidence that the Hollywood wheeler-dealer has become, in many versions, almost endearingly amoral at just the moment when Hollywood itself has become more corporate-minded than at any time in its history. To corporate nine-to-fivers in their fluorescent cubicles who came West with dreams of wild parties and wide-open-town millions, this figure takes on a romantic tinge -- Sammy Glick, cunning operator, betrayer extraordinaire, the quickest rat in the maze. If only!</p>
        <p>''The dramatic transformation of Sammy Glick from the anti-hero of the 40's to the role-model hero for the yuppies of the 80's is a painful reminder of the moral breakdown we are suffering, without even seeming to realize that suffering is involved,'' Mr. Schulberg wrote in his 1989 afterword.</p>
        <p>The myth did not begin with Sammy Glick, of course. In the beginning, the public image of the movie mogul was that of a recent immigrant, probably Jewish, with the scent of the Lower East Side clinging to him and a background in the garment industry and the burgeoning world of the nickelodeons. As Robert Sklar, author of ''Movie-Made America,'' describes it, many ''regarded the rise of the storefront-theater managers to fabulous wealth and power with a mixture of awe and amusement.'' Their contempt was revealed in the name they created to describe the men.</p>
        <p>''The term 'movie mogul' came into use around 1915, nicely describing the immigrant producers in the eyes of the public -- part splendid emperors, part barbarian invaders,'' Mr. Sklar wrote. ''Their foreignness, their alleged ignorance, were the subjects of a thousand jokes.''</p>
        <p>By the end of the silent era, the older generation was drifting away and a younger breed of moguls -- slicker, more assimilated -- was taking their place. It was in this context that the archetype of the Hollywood wheeler-dealer was born.</p>
        <p>Initially a tragic figure (Monroe Stahr in F. Scott Fitzgerald's ''The Last Tycoon''), he became almost a benevolent despot (the carping studio chiefs in ''Sullivan's Travels,'' Adolphe Menjou in ''A Star in Born'') before mutating into the villainous Sammy Glick and then into scoundrels of a marginally more sympathetic stripe, whose duplicity was mitigated by their passion for moviemaking (Kirk Douglas in the 1952 movie ''The Bad and the Beautiful'').</p>
        <p>In a letter to his editor at Collier's magazine in 1939, Fitzgerald described why he created Monroe Stahr, a fictional version of Irving Thalberg, the legendary MGM producer of the late 20's and early 30's. ''Thalberg has always fascinated me,'' Fitzgerald wrote. ''His peculiar charm, his extraordinary good looks, his bountiful success, the tragic end of his great adventure. I have chosen him for my hero (this has been in my mind for three years) because he is one of the half-dozen men I have known who were built on the grand scale.''</p>
        <p>It was Monroe Stahr's aspirations -- to greatness, to power, to artistic purity -- that made his fall so tragic. But of those three aspirations, the only one that could be applied to Sammy Glick was an aspiration, indeed a lust, for power. What the two men have in common, though, is a complete lack of the kind of credentials that might be required to achieve success in mainstream society.</p>
        <p>''Though Stahr's education was founded on nothing more than a night school course in stenography, he had a long time ago run ahead through trackless wastes of perception into fields where very few men were able to follow him,'' Fitzgerald wrote.</p>
        <p>Sammy Glick's education was founded on even less than this; his gift was for bluff and betrayal. He fashioned himself a screenwriter but could hardly write his name. He stole other people's ideas, without a backward glance.</p>
        <p>By the 1970's and 1980's, he had evolved into a more satiric, even absurd figure (Ron Silver in the 1982 movie ''Best Friends,'' wearing a mask of laid-backness to smooth out his essential monomania; Michael Lerner in the Coen Brothers' 1991 film ''Barton Fink,'' Steve Martin as the ersatz Joel Silver action-flick producer in Lawrence Kasdan's 1991 movie ''Grand Canyon'').</p>
        <p>Only in the 1990's did he reach his full flowering as a kind of paranoid sadist, albeit an attractive one (Tim Robbins in the 1992 movie ''The Player,'' Kevin Spacey in the 1994 film ''Swimming With Sharks'').</p>
        <p>When Fox's short-lived television series ''Action!,'' bombed out last year, its self-consciously profane and gleefully malevolent portrait of the Hollywood producer Peter Dragon (Jay Mohr) was deemed too insider and too nasty for mass tastes. In a review of the series in The New York Times, Caryn James described Mr. Mohr's character as ''a producer who understands that his grand success exists in direct proportion to his ruthlessness. He seems to come by his savage attitude naturally.''</p>
        <p>Maybe the Hollywood wheeler-dealer archetype had finally gone too far? Don't bet on it. He's still out there, hiding in the bushes, just as savage and seductive as always.</p>
        <p>One of the new Internet sites dedicated to games and streaming video for the 12-to-24-year-old set, www. thethreshhold.com, has a regular animated series called ''The Producer'' that puts a kind of sophomoric, ''South Park'' spin on the Hollywood sub-genre. It's antihero is Lester Spaxman, president of the fictional Spaxmedia. ''So driven by his vision and passion to make spectacular films, Lester is constantly blind to those he plows over on his path to success,'' says the on-line character description. ''Lester lives according to a twisted set of morals, specifically tailored for survival in Hollywood.''</p>
        <p>A computer game called ''Hollywood Mogul'' promises players a chance to ''go inside the dream factory and run your own movie studio.'' You become studio head, are responsible for the release of 100 feature films. If you win, you get immense wealth and an Academy Award. ''All you need to immerse yourself in the simulated world of Hollywood Mogul is a love for movies,'' says promotional materials for the game. ''Of course, it doesn't hurt if you're capable of being completely power-hungry and ruthless as you wield an obscene amount of power over other people's lives (which is always fun).''</p>
        <p>The Hollywood wheeler-dealer has also played another cultural role: capitalism's nadir, the example of what can happen when ruthlessness and self-interest are carried too far. Two recent biographies of modern-day moguls (''The Operator: David Geffen Builds, Buys and Sells the New Hollywood'' by Tom King and ''The Keys to the Kingdom: How Michael Eisner Lost His Grip'' by Kim Masters) are finger-wagging examples. Tsk, tsk, those awful moguls. They lie! They cheat! They think only of themselves! But they hang out with really cool famous people.</p>
        <p>When the director Bruce Beresford (the 1989 movie ''Driving Miss Daisy,'' among many others) decided to stage a version of ''Rigoletto'' for the Los Angeles Opera this season, he and his creative crew began noodling around ideas for something that wouldn't be just another version of Verdi's tragedy.</p>
        <p>''We realized that there was nothing quite so much like a ducal court in medieval Italy as the world of a major Hollywood mogul,'' Mr. Beresford said.</p>
        <p>In the production that was presented last month at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, the Duke of Mantua became Duke Mantua, a Hollywood big shot with a sprawling estate in Bel-Air. Rigoletto was transformed from a conniving fool into a conniving agent. And the members of the ducal court were yes-men and hangers-on for the hedonistic, self-absorbed Duke.</p>
        <p>''It was really eerie, it fit so perfectly,'' Mr. Beresford said.</p>
        <p>Is Hollywood really more ruthless and predatory than any other lucrative business? No, although it likes to think that it is. ''Hollywood is a jungle and the smaller animals have to run for their lives,'' Mr. Schulberg wrote in 1941. Many of the hustlers trying to break into the movie game would puff with pride at such a description of the world in which they live. After all, if I'm surviving, I must be a big animal.</p>
        <p>Perhaps Hollywood has become a more comfortable nest for this American archetype because of the history and composition of the place, its mixture of glamour and otherness. It reflects America, but it's not really a part of it. Hollywood is seen as a place that rewards ruthlessness and betrayal, where glib patter goes farther than solid credentials.</p>
        <p>It's difficult to imagine simply walking into a Wall Street investment bank or a Seattle high-tech company without any training or track record and somehow weaseling your way to the top. But any slob can do it in Hollywood, or so the myth goes. It's an illusion that still draws them to Southern California by the Titanic-load.</p>
        <p>Nebbishes from any walk of life -- convinced that, given half a chance, they could act or write or hustle as competently as anyone -- are free to fantasize about playing out their own Sammy Glick melodrama. All they have to do is brush up on the local lingo, buy a lot of black clothes and jettison their moral compass, just for the time being.</p>
        <p>That's the message of Hollywood wheeler-dealer stereotype. The only difference between moguls and you is that they are willing to do what it takes. That's why they're in the back of the limousine with their cleavage pets and you're stuck in tunnel traffic.</p>
        <p>In some eyes, it's the ultimate capitalist fantasy. No rules, not even basic decency, except as a ruse. It's capitalism turned topsy-turvy, wrenched of any boundaries, regulatory or moral, like some Southern California version of Moscow after the collapse of the Soviet Union. And even those who don't embrace the macho code of get-'em-before-they-get-you, who despise people like that, can still indulge in the fantasy.</p>
        <p>NBC broadcast a two-part adaptation of ''What Makes Sammy Run?'' back in 1960. Not long after, Steve Lawrence starred in a Broadway musical version. But thus far, there has never been a movie adaptation of the book that, to most people, speaks most directly to the heart of this mythical Hollywood of back-stabbing hustlers and unalloyed selfishness.</p>
        <p>''It's been on the front burner and the back burner many times over the years,'' Mr. Schulberg said. ''At the moment, it's somewhere in between.''</p>
        <p>Warner Brothers, which currently controls the rights to the novel, is in talks with someone -- Mr. Schulberg said he can't say who it is -- to finally make a Sammy Glick movie. ''They're trying to make a deal,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Paradoxically, however, it is only by happenstance that this wheeler-dealer figure has come to be associated with Hollywood. Mr. Schulberg, who was the son of a prominent Hollywood producer and grew up in that world, said he never intended to suggest that the rules in Hollywood were any different than those on Wall Street.</p>
        <p>''In a way, it's been unfair to Hollywood,'' Mr. Schulberg said. ''I never meant to suggest that it was a purely Hollywood syndrome. Sammy Glicks can and do operate in the stock market, too.''</p>
        <p>Why then, do we persist in having this Hollywood type emerge, again and again?</p>
        <p>''Obviously, Hollywood has always been kind of a magnet in terms of being sexier and in the public eye,'' he said. ''It's always easier to hang this type of attitude on a Hollywood wheeler-dealer than on some wheeler-dealer who is just wheeling and dealing in some more ordinary job. Here, he's with the stars. It's just sexier.''</p>
        <p>The strange irony, though, is that just as the Hollywood wheeler-dealer archetype has mutated into this dark hero of hedonistic free-enterprise, the real-life Hollywood executives are moving inexorably toward buttoned-down corporate America -- not that refined boardrooms don't have their own forms of cold-blooded ruthlessness, where proper pedigree is less important than raw business talent. Sammy Glicks still exist in Hollywood. But as the movie studios are being swallowed by larger corporate entities, becoming little more than departments within divisions of mega-media empires, the real executives tend more toward business school models than Sammy's school of hard knocks.</p>
        <p>This shift may account for part of the durability of the stereotype -- to many who came to Los Angeles hoping for the free-wheeling capitalism of the Glick myth only to find a corporate world of marketing meetings and company canteens, the Hollywood wheeler-dealer becomes a kind of romantic figure, a gleefully dark self-image, embraced all the more fervently. Undoubtedly, that is one reason that the archetype is kept alive in movies and television series and related entertainment vehicles. It's the Mr. Hyde that so many Jekylls search for in their midnight dreams.</p>
        <p>''Yes, I suppose that Hollywood is becoming more corporate, I am sure it is,'' Mr. Beresford said. ''But there are still a lot of Sammy Glicks out there. You know there are. I meet them every day.''</p>
