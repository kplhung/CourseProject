        <p>MR. PHILLIPS</p>
        <p>By John Lanchester.</p>
        <p>291 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>A Marian Wood Book/</p>
        <p>G. P. Putnam's Sons. $24.95.</p>
        <p>The eponymous hero of John Lanchester's second novel is an exemplar of that peculiarly contemporary creature that might be called Homo statisticus. He's not so much an average man as an averaged and constantly averaging one. Within moments of waking up in his average middle-class semidetached house in London, next to his wife of average middle-aged heft and attractiveness, he's calculating the typical English couple's likelihood of not having sex on a given day (96.71233 percent) and the minuscule probability (0.6 percent) that a 50-something pair like them who skip the spermicide will make a baby by the end of the year. His morning commute brings more figures: the number of British women willing to take their clothes off for magazines and morning tabloids each year (16,744); the percentage of Londoners who've never seen a corpse, been on a boat on the Thames or had anal sex (33.6 percent) and the average amount of time per day -- two hours and 37 minutes -- a typical person has free, from babyhood to the carpeted boredom of midlife, for pretty much doing nothing.</p>
        <p>''It is a lot of blank space to account for in one lifespan,'' Mr. Phillips remarks to himself. But Mr. Phillips is an accountant by profession, and accounting for himself, the reader soon learns, has suddenly become his full-time job. On the previous Friday he was sacked, the latest victim of his own cost-benefit analysis (and before he had a chance to present his plan to save 7,500 pounds annually by reducing employee theft). The novel tracks Mr. Phillips roughly from 9 to 5 on the first Monday of the rest of his life. It's something of a waking dream, a string of disjointed, emotionally muffled episodes marked by strange sexual upcroppings, episodes that are sometimes powerfully unsettling without quite working themselves up to the condition of a plot.</p>
        <p>Mr. Phillips's wanderings, like those of a cut-rate Leopold Bloom, map the outlines of a city where everyone seems to be going indifferently about his daily business without in fact doing anything particularly normal. Wandering in Battersea Park, he chats with an editor of porn magazines who's trolling for inspiration around the tennis courts. Next he encounters a bungee jumper (accelerating at 32 feet per second per second, Mr. Phillips notes), a tramp who may in fact be a performance artist and a woman who heckles tour guides in obscure rooms of the Tate Gallery more or less full time. After a perfunctory lunch (49.16 pounds) with his older son, Martin, a misogynist yuppie, there's little left to do but browse the porn district, pondering ''statistically unrepresentative'' genital prosthetics and the hilariously representative ineptitude of a blue movie called ''Jim MacTool and the Salmon of Wisdom.''</p>
        <p>All this is the occasion for the unpacking of a rather mundane set of memories -- the childhood privations of postwar rationing, a former schoolteacher who liked to thunder about sin, the rabbity lust of his honeymoon and the ''melodramatic bonfire'' that he lighted to consume the carefully preserved collection of dirty pictures (340 girls in all) discovered among his stolid working-class father's effects after his death. Lanchester has set himself the stern challenge of making a resolutely ordinary mind interesting without sliding into sentimentality -- of steering his creation closer to Mrs. Dalloway than Mr. Chips. The novel certainly has its wit about it, but marking time with Mr. Phillips is a bit of a disappointing fall to earth after the florid erudition and charming self-deceptions of Tarquin Winot, the gourmand narrator of Lanchester's ravishing debut novel, ''The Debt to Pleasure'' (1996). Victor Phillips (Lanchester lets his first name slip, flashing like a carefully hidden piece of skin) wears his banality a bit too heavily, like a thick worsted wool suit on an airless summer day. He's not a hollow man exactly, just one filled with disappointingly thin stuffing.</p>
        <p>Toward the end of the novel, genuine weirdness and outright improbability begin to burst through the placidly actuarial surface. Today, it turns out, is Mr. Phillips's lucky -- or unlucky -- day. Before it's over, he finds himself lying down next to Clarissa Colingford, a buxom celebrity with whom he has been obsessed, on the floor of a bank where he's gone to check his balance (3,500 pounds) only to find he's stumbled into a robbery. He passes the time calculating the odds of winning the lottery (one in 13,983,816) against the odds of dying in any given minute (one in 49,200,000). But in a surprising moment, he decides to push his luck and transforms his heightened ordinariness into a kind of common decency.</p>
        <p>''The city,'' Mr. Phillips remarks, ''is inhabited by people 99.999 percent of whom will never have a monument built to them, and who know it, and who repay the compliment by ignoring all the monuments and memorials to toffs and nobs and heroes and famous victories.'' God knows what this Victor will find to do or think about tomorrow, but merely living to see another day, in Lanchester's elegant calculus, should perhaps be counted a kind of small triumph.</p>
