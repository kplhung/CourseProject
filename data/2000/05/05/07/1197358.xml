        <p>CLAD all in black and gazing intensely from behind wire-rimmed spectacles, John Musto might easily be mistaken for one of the Jesuits who taught him Latin and Greek at Brooklyn Prep. But the sheet from an illuminated manuscript of Gregorian chant that adorns his living room on the Upper West Side of Manhattan is flanked by a shofar, a Victrola and the two Emmy Awards he won for composing scores for PBS documentaries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Musto seemed elated one recent afternoon, having just finished ''Penelope,'' a song cycle on poetry by the playwright Denise Lanctot. Commissioned by the 92nd Street Y, the work will receive its premiere there on Wednesday evening, in a program presented by Ned Rorem that also features works by Ricky Ian Gordon and Daron Hagen.</p>

        <p>CLAD all in black and gazing intensely from behind wire-rimmed spectacles, John Musto might easily be mistaken for one of the Jesuits who taught him Latin and Greek at Brooklyn Prep. But the sheet from an illuminated manuscript of Gregorian chant that adorns his living room on the Upper West Side of Manhattan is flanked by a shofar, a Victrola and the two Emmy Awards he won for composing scores for PBS documentaries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Musto seemed elated one recent afternoon, having just finished ''Penelope,'' a song cycle on poetry by the playwright Denise Lanctot. Commissioned by the 92nd Street Y, the work will receive its premiere there on Wednesday evening, in a program presented by Ned Rorem that also features works by Ricky Ian Gordon and Daron Hagen.</p>
        <p>''Now that I've reached the double bar, it's time to start learning it,'' said Mr. Musto, who will accompany the soprano Amy Burton in the premiere. He is nearly as busy a pianist as he is a composer, playing everything from Schubert to Ives and Comden and Green at the Metropolitan Museum, the Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival, the Spoleto Festival, the Bard Music Festival, and Joe's Pub at the Public Theater. And he hopes to be busier still.</p>
        <p>''I want to make more time for performing,'' said Mr. Musto, who is 46. ''It revitalizes my energies for composing. If anything went wrong in the 20th century, it's that the composer abandoned the stage. Can you imagine a choreographer who's never danced? But now there are composers with doctorates who can't play 'Chopsticks.' It should be a law, like jury duty. Every composer should have to step up to the plate, in front of a paying audience, at least once a year.''</p>
        <p>Like many of Mr. Musto's vocal works, ''Penelope'' is dedicated to Ms. Burton. Besides being his favorite partner on stage, Ms. Burton is also his wife of 16 years and the mother of his precocious 6-year-old son, Joshua.</p>
        <p>Mr. Musto's musically striking and vocally grateful songs are prized not only by frequent collaborators like Ms. Burton and the baritones William Sharp and Chris Pedro Trakas. They already claim a place in the recital repertory and are programmed by artists including Susan Graham, Felicity Lott, Frederica von Stade and Dawn Upshaw.</p>
        <p>Smart singers are surely attracted by Mr. Musto's keen, eclectic literary taste. His catalog includes settings of verses by E. E. Cummings, Robert Frost, Langston Hughes, Dorothy Parker, Christina Rossetti and Carl Sandburg as well as the finest contemporary poets. But perhaps even more enticing is Mr. Musto's way of exposing the heart of these texts in picturesque music of imagination, beauty and a peculiarly urban sort of energy.</p>
        <p>''John's music is real Gebrauchsmusik, not the sort of dry, theoretical music that someone of his erudition might be prone to write,'' said the pianist Steven Blier, using a German term meaning ''useful music.'' Mr. Blier is an artistic director of the New York Festival of Song, which commissioned and performed Mr. Musto's cycle ''Quiet Songs'' and, in March, ''Rags for the Richest,'' a scene for mezzo-soprano, tenor and piano, with a text by Ms. Lanctot.</p>
        <p>''Beyond its immediate melodic and rhythmic appeal, there's a depth and complexity to John's music that rewards repeated performance and listening,'' Mr. Blier added. ''He's got a real compositional voice, full of profound feeling and surprising colors.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Musto's musical creativity and catholicity emerged early. The son of a jazz guitarist, he became the organist at his Bensonhurst parish at 8, reveling especially in improvisation.</p>
        <p>''I remember loving the sound of the pedals but not being able to reach them,'' he said. ''One day I decided to go for it and fell right off the bench. I wound up playing almost all the pedals, a 16-foot tone cluster in the middle of 'Praise to the Lord.' It woke a few people up.''</p>
        <p>While studying piano with Seymour Lipkin at the Manhattan School of Music, Mr. Musto earned scholarship funds by apprenticing with the school's piano technician. After graduation, the marketable skill thus acquired earned him a living, supplemented by playing in rock bands and jazz clubs and arranging popular music.</p>
        <p>Being a piano technician also gave him a superb entree to the New York music scene. One client, the pianist Paul Jacobs, became Mr. Musto's teacher, mentor and friend until his death in 1983. Jacobs's Steinway grand, previously owned by Samuel Barber, now dominates Mr. Musto's living room.</p>
        <p>By 1988, Mr. Musto was busy enough as a composer and pianist to close his piano-tuning business. His works were being published, and residency offers, recording opportunities and commissions began to flow in. Among the most significant was the orchestral song cycle ''Dove Sta Amore,'' which made him a finalist for the 1997 Pulitzer Prize in music. Last year, Carnegie Hall commissioned his ''From the Book of Common Prayer,'' a cycle for vocal quartet and piano, based on poems of Katherine Mosby.</p>
        <p>''Now John needs to be encouraged to be an opera composer,'' Mr. Blier said. ''With his sense of drama, timing, atmosphere, structure, character and humor, he's exactly the person who could write operas that would really join the repertory.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Musto is, in fact, at work on his first opera, ''Pope Joan,'' based on the legend of a medieval woman who disguised herself as a man and ascended to the papacy. Its brilliant overture is already making the rounds of American orchestras. Mr. Musto and his librettist, Ms. Lanctot, have received a Rockefeller Foundation fellowship, enabling them to spend August working on the opera at a retreat on Lake Como in Italy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Musto's instrumental works display the same imagination and idiomatic grasp as his vocal works. His Piano Trio and his Divertimento promise to enjoy long shelf lives. Mr. Musto is working on a violin concerto for Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, a piano concerto for himself and a clarinet quintet for David Krakauer, which will have its premiere on a Musto program at the Miller Theater of Columbia University next February.</p>
        <p>''If you understand the concept of virtuosity on one instrument, you'll understand it on another,'' said Mr. Musto, who claims to practice scales and arpeggios daily. And you believe him when he scurries to the piano to play a movement from Elliott Carter's thorny Piano Sonata, a spontaneous rendition of ''Never-Never Land'' and a piano rag of his own composition, complete with a proper cadenza. Perhaps it is no accident that at Steinway Hall, Mr. Musto's photograph hangs between those of Rudolf Serkin and Billy Joel.</p>
