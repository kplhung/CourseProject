        <p>Motorcycle Tours</p>
        <p>Q. My wife and I are interested in motorcycle trips in the United States, Europe, Costa Rica, New Zealand, etc. We are looking for an upscale trip with top accommodations.  We would like a guide and chase vehicle with air-conditioning for my wife to ride in. -- Kenneth Sher, Syosset, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A. For those seeking primarily superior accommodations, Edelweiss Bike Travel offers tours in the Alps, Spain and California -- each of which operates twice a year. Among the places at which participants are scheduled to stay are the Carlton in St. Moritz, Switzerland; the Parador de Cardona, in a ninth-century castle near Barcelona; and the Fairmont in San Francisco. Note that while the Edelweiss brochure describes the lodgings in the Alps and California as first class or deluxe, it calls those in Spain ''comfortable to first class.''</p>

        <p>Motorcycle Tours</p>
        <p>Q. My wife and I are interested in motorcycle trips in the United States, Europe, Costa Rica, New Zealand, etc. We are looking for an upscale trip with top accommodations.  We would like a guide and chase vehicle with air-conditioning for my wife to ride in. -- Kenneth Sher, Syosset, N.Y.</p>
        <p>A. For those seeking primarily superior accommodations, Edelweiss Bike Travel offers tours in the Alps, Spain and California -- each of which operates twice a year. Among the places at which participants are scheduled to stay are the Carlton in St. Moritz, Switzerland; the Parador de Cardona, in a ninth-century castle near Barcelona; and the Fairmont in San Francisco. Note that while the Edelweiss brochure describes the lodgings in the Alps and California as first class or deluxe, it calls those in Spain ''comfortable to first class.''</p>
        <p>As for air-conditioning in a chase or support vehicle, it is the exception for major tour operators. While you might get one stateside, there's no guarantee.</p>
        <p>In any event, tour operators point out, support vehicles are intended primarily for transporting luggage and coming to the aid of weary riders. They also say that the route and schedule for such vehicles may differ from the motorcyclists'; so this  kind of vacation may not result in a fully shared experience. One final point underscored by operators: These trips are designed for experienced and alert cyclists.</p>
        <p>Charges are based on double occupancy and do not include air fare. The rates are based on one cyclist's riding solo. Itineraries do not list every stop.</p>
        <p>To provide a rough basis for comparison, here are details on Alpine tours run by three companies.</p>
        <p>First, the Austria-based Edelweiss Bike Travel, whose North American representative is Tri-Community Travel, Post Office Box 1974, Wrightwood, Calif. 93297; (800) 582-2263 or (760) 249-5825, fax (760) 249-3857; www.edelweissbiketravel.com.  All the cycles for Royal tours are BMW's, with the model determining the cost. If your wife travels in a separate vehicle, the cost is the same as two people riding a single bike and sharing a room.</p>
        <p>Alpine, 16 days. Itinerary: Munich, Salzburg, the Dolomites in Italy, Switzerland, the Arlberg region of Austria, Liechtenstein and Germany. Total mileage: 1,000 to 1,800. Rest days: 7. Cost per person: $3,970 to $5,090. Departs June 3 and July 8.</p>
        <p>Spanish Castles, 16 days. Itinerary: Barcelona, Andorra, a corner of France. Total mileage: 1,700. Rest days: 3. Cost: $3,985 to $5,140. Departs Sept. 16.</p>
        <p>California, 8 days. San Francisco, Little River, Mendocino and, in Napa Valley, Boyes Hot Springs. Total mileage: 400. Two rest days and one day of warm-up loops. Cost: $2,570 to $3,340.</p>
        <p>Beachs Motorcycle Adventures, 2763 West River Parkway, Grand Island, N.Y. 14072; (716) 773-4960, fax (716) 773-5227; www.beachs-mca.com. Itinerary for 15-day trips that arrive in Munich on May 28, June 18, July 9 and 30 and Aug. 20 includes Salzburg; Arabba, Italy; Interlaken, Switzerland; Imst, Austria. Rest days: 2. Total mileage: 1,350. Cost: $4,150 for the solo rider, $3,250 for the passenger.</p>
        <p>Another operator you can try, although it does not have a chase vehicle for its Alps trip, is the American Motorcyclist Association, 13515 Yarmouth Drive, Pickerington, Ohio 43147; (614) 856-1900, fax (614) 856-1921; www.amadirectlink.com.</p>
        <p>Getting to Lourdes</p>
        <p>Q. What is the best way to travel to the Shrine at Lourdes in France, near the Spanish border? Is it easier to travel from Paris or somewhere in Spain? -- R. Roberts, Milwaukee</p>
        <p>A. As the crow flies, Lourdes is clearly closer to Barcelona and Madrid than it is to Paris. But once you take into account the Pyrenees, the picture is very different: It's a 10-hour train trip from Madrid and a bit less from Barcelona vs. 5 hours and 35 minutes on the T.G.V. from the Montparnasse Station in Paris.</p>
        <p>Unless you have lots of time -- three more hours, in fact -- you will not want to leave from the Austerlitz Station in Paris. The cost from both stations is the same: $116 first class. $91 second class. Information: (800) 438-7245 or www.raileurope.com.</p>
        <p>A plane from Spain to Lourdes should be faster than a train. But it's not, because flights to the Ossun-Lourdes Airport (LDE is the code) from either Barcelona or Madrid go to Paris first. On top of that, most Iberia and all Air France flights bound for Lourdes from Barcelona and Madrid arrive at Charles de Gaulle Airport but leave from Orly.</p>
        <p>As for cost, flying from Paris costs about $109 for a 75-minute flight.</p>
        <p>Other than someone trying to get into the Guinness Book of Records, who would spend 4 hours and 40 minute to fly from Barcelona via Paris or an hour less from Barcelona? Both flights are $290 one way.</p>

        <p>Ashkenazy in Prague</p>
        <p>Q. I am planning a trip to Prague in the fall and would like to know when Vladimir Ashkenazy will be conducting at Dvorak Hall. -- Marilyn F. Rothstein, Boca Raton, Fla.</p>
        <p>A. Mr. Ashkenazy will conduct the Czech Philharmonic in eight concerts from September to the end of the year at Dvorak Hall in the Rudolfinum. It was Antonin Dvorak who conducted the orchestra's first concert in 1896.</p>
        <p>On Sept. 28 and 29 two works by Mozart -- his Overture to ''Don Giovanni'' and, with the soprano Barbara Bonney as soloist, ''Exsultate Jubilate'' will be performed -- as will Suk's Serenade and Bartok's Dance Suite. Scheduled for Nov. 9 and 10 are the Sibelius Violin Concerto with Ida Haendel as soloist and Strauss' ''Ein Heldenleben.'' On Nov. 16 and 17, the program will be Martinu's ''Frescoes of Piero della Francesca,'' Berg's Lyric Suite and Strauss' ''Symphonia Domestica.'' And on the program for Dec. 14 and 15 are the Brahms Piano Concerto No. 2, with Evgeny Kissin as soloist, and Alexander von Zemlinsky's Lyric Symphony, with soloists to be announced.</p>
        <p>Next season's prices have yet to be set, but tickets for this season are $5.90 to $12.85, at the rate of 38.22 crowns to the dollar. They can be bought at the box office, corner of Ulice 17 Listopadu and Namesti Jana Palacha. It is open 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. weekdays and one hour before the concert; closed weekends. (All performances start at 7:30 p.m.) Or you can write to the Czech Philharmonic Orchestra, Alsovo Nabrezi 12, 110 01 Prague 1; telephone (420-2) 248 93 352, fax (420-2) 23 14 110; www.czechphilharmonic.cz.</p>
