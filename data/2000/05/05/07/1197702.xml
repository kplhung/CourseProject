        <p>These last-minute script changes can be murder.</p>
        <p>Here's how it was supposed to happen: The Los Angeles Lakers, the team that dominated the regular season, ending it with a 67-15 record and generating talk of a National Basketball Association dynasty in the making, were supposed to wave sweetly and then run down the Sacramento Kings like a tractor-trailer passing a speed bump.</p>
        <p>Instead, the Lakers handily won the first two games of the three-of-five-game series in the first round of the playoffs, then fumbled the third in the final quarter and never even led at any point in the fourth game.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, Los Angeles was forced to face the possibility that its team might be eliminated in the fifth and decisive game by a speed bump that turned into a mountain.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for the Lakers, they were able to call in some script doctors -- Los Angeles is full of them -- and tinker with the final act. The result was a thorough roto-rootering of the Kings on Friday night before a raucous Staples Center crowd, 113-86.</p>
        <p>The Lakers controlled the game from the opening tip and led by 10 points or so throughout most of the first half, extending their advantage to 15 points just before the half. It only got worse for Sacramento, with the lead inching up to 20, then 25, then 30, finally peaking at 37 before Lakers Coach Phil Jackson sent in the bench, and the lead finally dwindled to a mere bone-crushing 27.</p>
        <p>The Lakers led about any way you looked at it, with 52 percent shooting to the Kings' 34 percent and 54 rebounds to the Kings' 35. Even the Lakers' bench performed well against the Kings' more touted bench, scoring 42 points, just one less than the Sacramento reserves. Chris Webber had 20 points, but he was the only King in double digits.</p>
        <p>''We were pretty confident about it, but you don't know until they throw up the tip and there you go,'' Jackson said after the game.</p>
        <p>The man who took much of the heat for the Lakers' losses in Games 3 and 4 was center Shaquille O'Neal, a leading contender for the league's most valuable player award. The Kings double- and triple-teamed him effectively, leaving him with point totals of 21 and 25, around half of the 46 points he scored in the opening game.</p>
        <p>On Friday night, however, O'Neal was back in form, scoring 32 points and grabbing 18 rebounds. He said it was a call from his father that got him back on track.</p>
        <p>''I was kind of down after the two bad games I'd had,'' O'Neal said. ''My dad said to me: 'You idiot, you always play bad in Sacramento. Just play good at home.' ''</p>
        <p>After that, O'Neal said, he replayed the season in his mind and realized he had always played below par in Sacramento. It gave him confidence going into the final game.</p>
        <p>''I think I was being kind of hard on myself,'' he said. ''Thank God for home-court advantage.''</p>
        <p>Jackson said that all of the talk of an M.V.P. award had played a part in O'Neal's fifth-game renaissance.</p>
        <p>''The odds are pretty good he's going to be named M.V.P. in the next two weeks, and he wanted to prove to people that he was worthy of that,'' Jackson said. ''And he did that tonight.''</p>
        <p>The victory certainly provided a boost for Los Angeles, which had been on full smug alert following the team's initial two victories followed by panic after its two losses.</p>
        <p>This was not at all how it was supposed to happen. The Kings had gone into the playoffs seeded eighth -- the Lakers were seeded No. 1 -- and had ended the regular season 23 games behind Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>The Lakers knew they had history on their side in the final game. Only twice since the five-game playoff matchups began in 1984 had a No. 1-seeded team fallen to a No. 8. But the Lakers also had a history of bingeing on defeat in the postseason in recent years, losing four games in a row to San Antonio last year and four in a row to Utah the year before.</p>
        <p>''We knew if we didn't bring our A game, we were going to be making history,'' O'Neal said after Friday night's victory. ''And we didn't want to make history that way. So we brought our A game.''</p>
        <p>The Lakers will next face the Phoenix Suns, beginning Sunday with two games at Staples Center. The Suns have lost to the Lakers each time they met this season, but Jackson was cautious Friday night.</p>
        <p>''That's not the whole story,'' he said. The Suns had improved as a team throughout the season, he said.</p>
        <p>O'Neal agreed. ''They're scrappy,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some of the Lakers' critics have pointed out that the team had dominated the recent season so handily that it had yet to undergo a close brush with disaster, the kind of character-building exercise that a team often needs to reach the championships. Perhaps, Jackson said, this series with Sacramento was it.</p>
        <p>''I don't care when it had to happen, but I've been talking all year about how we needed a trial by fire,'' he said. ''Certainly, a team has to have that at some point to develop the mettle and grit and to be able to sustain the poise, direction and intensity.</p>
        <p>''They gave us a lot of push, and we needed that as a basketball team if we're going to advance.''</p>
        <p>O'Neal added: ''This was a good test for us. We just have to remain dominant at home and then win some on the road.''</p>
