        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I was disappointed by your May 4 editorial about the death of Cardinal John O'Connor. You seemed to portray him more as a power broker while in my view minimizing the full scope of his accomplishments and compassion for the people of this city.</p>
        <p>You disagreed with the cardinal on many issues -- for instance, on abortion and gay rights. The tone of your editorial betrayed your opposition to the views the cardinal held.</p>

        <p>I was disappointed by your May 4 editorial about the death of Cardinal John O'Connor. You seemed to portray him more as a power broker while in my view minimizing the full scope of his accomplishments and compassion for the people of this city.</p>
        <p>You disagreed with the cardinal on many issues -- for instance, on abortion and gay rights. The tone of your editorial betrayed your opposition to the views the cardinal held.</p>
        <p>I had the honor of meeting Cardinal O'Connor once and admired him for the honesty and force with which he maintained his convictions, but mostly for his plain-spoken humanity. Like millions of others in New York and around the world, of many different faiths, I grieve his loss.</p>
