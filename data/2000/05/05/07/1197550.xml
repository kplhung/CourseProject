        <p>AS the founder of Astronet.com, an astrology Web site, Eugenie Diserio will gladly, even proudly, tell you that until recently she experienced plenty of setbacks, broken hearts, horrific blind dates, cars that broke down and unemployment. To her, life is about cycles -- caused by moons and planets moving in and out of one's celestial house -- and at 45 she's been through plenty of them.</p>
        <p>In her 30's, she went through a wild, glamorous, sleepless cycle as the lead singer of a New Wave dance band in Manhattan, the Model Citizens. Then, in 1989, she quit performing, had a child and moved to Woodstock, N.Y., where she baked bread, wore Birkenstocks and drove a Saab with nearly 200,000 miles on it. ''That was her Mother Earth time,'' said Dorette Sacripanti, a friend.</p>

        <p>AS the founder of Astronet.com, an astrology Web site, Eugenie Diserio will gladly, even proudly, tell you that until recently she experienced plenty of setbacks, broken hearts, horrific blind dates, cars that broke down and unemployment. To her, life is about cycles -- caused by moons and planets moving in and out of one's celestial house -- and at 45 she's been through plenty of them.</p>
        <p>In her 30's, she went through a wild, glamorous, sleepless cycle as the lead singer of a New Wave dance band in Manhattan, the Model Citizens. Then, in 1989, she quit performing, had a child and moved to Woodstock, N.Y., where she baked bread, wore Birkenstocks and drove a Saab with nearly 200,000 miles on it. ''That was her Mother Earth time,'' said Dorette Sacripanti, a friend.</p>
        <p>In 1992, after breaking up with a boyfriend, she returned to her hometown, New Canaan, Conn., moving into an apartment above her parents' garage. She arrived with no money, no job, her son (Jake, now 11) and a broken heart. ''She was really up a creek without a paddle,'' said her mother, Roseanne Diserio.</p>
        <p>Eventually, she got a 9-to-5 corporate job just for the health benefits, but hated it. ''I thought, 'God, I'm not supposed to be this generic person,' '' she said. When she was fired in 1994, she began a project everyone thought her wackiest yet: she created Astronet.com, which now includes daily horoscopes, astrological charts for couples and an advice column for the lovelorn, Ask Genie. (She's Genie.)</p>
        <p>As she built Astronet, which went online in 1995, the only men in her life were Jake and Sam, her overweight mutt. ''I was a total single mom,'' she said. ''Sometimes, I'd get depressed and Jake would say: 'Oh, Mom, you're not alone. You have me.' ''</p>
        <p>Then, in the fall of 1997, she met Bill Buttenwieser, a corporate pilot who is now 43. ''We were introduced by my sister, who had been my sole dinner partner up until then,'' Ms. Diserio said. ''Bill was recently separated and at a very low moment. My sister told him: 'You should really meet Eugenie. She's nice and she deals with a lot of people with problems.' So we met, and he unloaded.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Diserio got his birth date that night and checked him out astrologically. (She's a Libra; he's a Taurus.) ''We had a lot of compatibilities in our charts,'' she said. ''So I thought, 'Oh, I'll give this guy a chance.' '' As it turned out, the pilot and the astrologer had much in common. Both had been through failed relationships; both were parents (he has three daughters); both knew the stars well, albeit from different perspectives. She describes him as a punctual, orderly and poetic pilot who comes back from work and talks about the spectacular thunderstorms or shooting stars he saw that night.</p>
        <p>He said he began falling in love with Ms. Diserio right from the start: ''The first time I shook her hand it was like static electricity. There was really a power between us.''</p>
        <p>Now that her ''struggling days'' seem over, when people ask Ms. Diserio for advice, she's like a personal trainer. ''I get really tough on people,'' she said. ''I try to empower women, because there was a point in my life when I was so unempowered. You have to be very, very proactive. You have to make a good life.''</p>
        <p>The couple were married in Darien, Conn., on April 29, a day she chose after consulting her charts. The wedding was at the Woodway Country Club, where she used to play tennis in a black leather jacket in her Model Citizens era. This time she wore a conservative white gown with her hair in a bun. Jake gave her away and cried more than anyone. (From happiness, he said.)</p>
        <p>Now, Ms. Diserio hopes she's entering a stable, financially secure, suburban, domestic cycle. (Last year, Hearst New Media acquired Astronet for a price in the seven figures, and she now drives a ''Big Benz,'' as she calls it.) She and Mr. Buttenwieser are shopping for a house in New Canaan and want to have children of their own. ''I'm kind of a nester,'' she said. ''I was always moving. Now, I'm going to find a home and stay awhile.''</p>
