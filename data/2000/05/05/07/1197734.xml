        <p>Killer waves up to 20 feet high could crash ashore in the Middle Atlantic states if scientists are right about the danger posed by giant cracks in the seabed some 60 miles off Virginia and North Carolina. Writing in the May issue of Geology, they said the newly discovered cracks could mean the continental shelf was unstable and liable to slide down like an avalanche, inducing the rogue waves.</p>
        <p>The scientists are leaving this weekend on a 14-day expedition to gather more data to assess the risk, which could prove small if the cracks turn out to be geologically inactive.</p>
