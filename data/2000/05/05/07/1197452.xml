        <p>A DOZEN years ago, when Timothy Lewis came to White Plains as the organist and choir director at Grace Episcopal Church, many community outreach programs were in existence, but music -- other than for the regular services -- remained in short supply.</p>
        <p>That imbalance would soon be rectified, first with a series of what Mr. Lewis named Noonday Getaway concerts, then with holiday programs and other ambitious presentations.</p>
        <p>This season, the half-hour Getaway programs have featured everything from classical recitals to expeditions on Highland pipes, Japanese kotos and Caribbean steel drums. This season's final programs are cello and harp duos by Nancy Hambleton-Torrente and Joy Plaisted on  Wednesday, an organ recital by Linda Betjeman on May 17, music of Brazil by Arthur Lipner and Friends on May 24 and the Gerard Carelli Jazz Quartet on May 31.</p>
        <p>Today at 4 p.m., Mr. Lewis is conducting a chamber orchestra and soloists in a family program titled ''It's All Happening at the Zoo.'' As the announcement put it: ''a far-from-serious exploration of the world of classical music, with animals, jugglers, dancers and acrobats joining the Downtown Sinfonietta.'' Tickets may be obtained by calling the church at 949-0384.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewis recently talked about music, children and more.</p>
        <p>Q. What got you interested in presenting concerts?</p>
        <p>A. When I came here in 1988, the church had very strong outreach programs -- soup kitchens and things like that -- and it seemed logical to balance them with something that, to use ecclesiastical terminology, could feed people in a different kind of way. The arts unite us, in other words, so I see our music programs as a sort of extension of what the parish does on Sunday mornings.</p>
        <p>Q. What led to this afternoon's zoological expedition?</p>
        <p>A. I wanted to give children an introduction to orchestral instruments, but on a lazy Sunday afternoon in a friendly, nonthreatening way. When it occurred to me that we can all be united around our love for animals, the ''Zoo'' idea was born, and I went in search of music about animals and insects. We'll be playing such delightful miniatures as Grieg's ''Butterfly,'' Rimsky-Korsakov's ''Flight of the Bumble Bee'' and a funny little ''Mosquito Dance'' by Paul White.</p>
        <p>Q. You've also scheduled Vaughan Williams's ''Lark Ascending,'' which is neither funny nor a miniature. Why?</p>
        <p>A. Because it's so very beautiful and also features our wonderful first violinist Dorothy Happel. Yes, it is quite a bit longer than the other pieces, which is why I've asked three dancers to come up from the Cathedral of St. John the Divine to provide a visual component while the orchestra plays.</p>
        <p>Q. And you're also featuring a talking mime?</p>
        <p>A. I guess you could say that. Mace Perlman will help me emcee the program, so when we do sections of Saint-Saens's ''Carnival of the Animals,'' for instance, he'll first read the witty Ogden Nash verses, but then go into his mime mode and become the elephant and the swan and even a whole aviary. Again the idea is to let the youngsters find joy in music with a little help from some of the other performing arts.</p>
