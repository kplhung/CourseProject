        <p>A lot of attention is paid to how well New York City residents respond to the United States Census, one of the many reasons being that counting people in a city as populated, diverse and grouchy as New York is such a complicated and challenging task.</p>
        <p>The Census Bureau has been patting itself on its back because of the city's return rate during the mail-in phase of the census, which has ended and was replaced with door-to-door surveying on April 27. According to the latest figures, compiled in the last week of April, 53 percent of New Yorkers returned questionnaires, a percentage that matches the 1990 response rate and meets the bureau's target for the city.</p>
        <p>But the figure was well below the national average of 66 percent.</p>
        <p>In Brooklyn, the response rate was 48, almost 20 percentage points lower than the national figure. In the Bronx, the rate was 54 percent, in Manhattan 58 percent, in Staten Island 60 percent and in Queens 52 percent. In every borough except Manhattan, the figures were below the government's target rates.</p>
        <p>Census officials are also trying to explain the unexpectedly low response in the city's black neighborhoods, ranging from impoverished East New York in Brooklyn to affluent eastern Queens. The response in some black neighborhoods was as low as 30 percent, with the citywide average for blacks reaching only 39 percent, according to a New York Times analysis of data received so far.</p>
        <p>Neighborhoods with a large percentage of immigrants showed a higher response over 1990. In Washington Heights, a heavily Dominican neighborhood, 62 percent of residents responded. This was similar to the rate in other largely immigrant neighborhoods, including those in western Queens, where an extensive community outreach program encouraged residents to be counted.</p>
        <p>While only slightly more than half of all New Yorkers filled out the 2000 census forms, experts say this percentage is not as dismal as it seems because it represents a slight upturn from the last three counts.</p>
        <p>''There was a very big hemorrhage between 1980 and 1990,'' said Andrew A. Beveridge, a professor of sociology at Queens College who has been analyzing the latest census data. ''If you hold your own in New York City, you are doing well.''</p>
