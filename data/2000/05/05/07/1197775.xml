      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Downtown Saturday Night is an inspired bill featuring Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes (who are still one of the Garden State's most popular musical treasures) and Terrance Simien, a zydeco-Cajun accordionist and singer from Louisiana.</p>
        <p>One of the top live-performance acts on tour, Mr. Simien has a soulful voice similar to Sam Cooke's, and for over a decade his pop-styled zydeco has attracted a group of cultish followers called beadheads (he throws beads to his audience members). Zydeco music can stir the soul, and keeps the audience swaying, if not dancing.</p>

        <p>Downtown Saturday Night is an inspired bill featuring Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes (who are still one of the Garden State's most popular musical treasures) and Terrance Simien, a zydeco-Cajun accordionist and singer from Louisiana.</p>

        <p>Johnny and his Jukes also keep the audience on their feet. Having honed their skills playing Jersey Shore bars in the 1970's, and they continuously recorded first-rate R&amp;B-driven party music propelled by strong original material. Now that their mentors Bruce Springsteen and Miami Steve Van Zandt (currently a cast member on ''The Sopranos'') have moved on, harp-playing Johnny keeps the flame burning.</p>
        <p>An underappreciated act perfect for this under-the-tent soiree on Saturday in the Montclair Town Center.</p>
        <p>Montclair might not be quite Asbury Park, but hey, it's still a downtown Saturday night.</p>
