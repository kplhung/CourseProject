        <p>As closely contested as this Eastern Conference semifinal series has been, it seemed only a matter of time before the tension boiled over.</p>
        <p>It happened tonight after the final buzzer had sounded on the Devils' 4-3 victory over the Toronto Maple Leafs, giving New Jersey a 3-2 edge in the four-of-seven-game series. The Devils can close out the series at home on Monday night.</p>
        <p>Mayhem is the best way to describe the aftermath of the contest, and each side hurled accusations at the other after the fact.</p>
        <p>Toronto's Darcy Tucker took a run at Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur, only to be smothered by the Devils' John Madden. Toronto's Steve Thomas and the Devils' Scott Niedermayer -- former teammates -- were tangled together, the two trading cross-checks and high sticks.</p>
        <p>The Devils' captain, Scott Stevens, the game's first star because of his hard open-ice hits, jumped out of the penalty box and into the fracas. And Toronto's Tie Domi, one of the most feared men in the National Hockey League, was in front of both benches, slashing with his stick at the Devils' Jason Arnott and Claude Lemieux. Six penalties on four players were called in the confrontation.</p>
        <p>The Devils left the ice to objects hurtled toward them from the sellout crowd of 19,477 at Air Canada Center.</p>
        <p>''A bunch of sore losers,'' Stevens was overheard saying as he left the ice.</p>
        <p>''You heard that?'' Stevens asked afterward.</p>
        <p>When asked if he was referring to the Leafs or their fans, Stevens retorted: ''The fans were throwing a lot of stuff. I don't know.''</p>
        <p>Testy words came from both sides.</p>
        <p>Tucker, who was in Brodeur's face all evening, threatened to make a run at the Devil goaltender again in Game 6. Tucker did it twice tonight, once in the second period and again after the game ended.</p>
        <p>''What am I supposed to do, stand there until he lets me out of the net?'' Tucker asked, referring to the second-period roughing penalty he took against Brodeur, which came after Tucker had collided with Brodeur en route to the back of the net on an unsuccessful rush. Brodeur had hacked right back at Tucker after Tucker made his way out of the net. Tucker ended up flat on his face before skating over to the penalty box.</p>
        <p>That was nothing compared to what ensued after the final buzzer had sounded, with Toronto on the power play, its goalie pulled, Stevens in the penalty box and the Leafs out of time and one goal short.</p>
        <p>With the game finally over, Brodeur exacted one last measure of revenge on Tucker with his stick, then accused Tucker of taking a dive.</p>
        <p>Once he realized the game was over, Tucker responded by charging Brodeur. The two exchanged shoves to the head before Madden jumped in and smothered Tucker.</p>
        <p>''I got four or five cross-checks, then I got the butt end of his stick,'' Tucker said, referring to Brodeur. ''If he wants to do that, I'll run him over next game.''</p>
        <p>''At a buck seventy,'' Brodeur retorted, referring to Tucker's weight of 170 pounds, ''he can hit me all the time. This is not part of anybody's game. It will just give me a power play. So I hope he runs me.''</p>
        <p>Stevens said, ''That's fine, because our power play is going quite well right now.''</p>
        <p>The Leafs, meanwhile, were calling for Stevens to be suspended because he joined the fray from the penalty box, where he had spent the game's final 17 seconds after being whistled for hooking Thomas while Brodeur weathered a furious Toronto attack.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if he should be suspended,'' said Toronto's captain, Mats Sundin, who was on the ice at the end. ''If the game's over, he's not allowed to come in and start going at guys.''</p>
        <p>Stevens said it was only natural to help out his teammates, considering they were outmanned, six to four, at the time.</p>
        <p>Stevens is allowed to come out of the box and celebrate a victory, a league official said. The official said videotapes of the ending would be reviewed very closely.</p>
        <p>It figures that the officials will look at Domi's actions, too. Domi jumped off the bench to confront the Devils after he saw Stevens join the confrontation.</p>
        <p>''Stevens came out of the penalty box throwing punches,'' Domi said. ''He'll probably get a slap in the hand. If it was me, it would be 10 games. We'll see what happens.''</p>
        <p>Stevens, however, recalled a slash by Domi on Arnott's hand. ''How about Tie Domi slashing guys on the bench?'' Stevens said. ''Did you see that one?''</p>
