        <p>Ten months after they fled the province in the face of revenge attacks from Kosovo Albanians, the Serbs of Kosovo and other minorities are seeing international political will swing in their favor.</p>
        <p>Preparations to help hundreds, even thousands, of Serbs and Gypsies to return this summer are gaining momentum and have sparked vigorous competition between local Serbian leaders to reap the political rewards of bringing people home.</p>
        <p>So far, Albanian leaders have not opposed the planned returns, although they have set some conditions and excluded the return of any suspected war criminals. As the plans materialize, international aid officials warn that opposition will grow.</p>
        <p>Western governments, peacekeepers and the United Nations administration here are showing a sudden determination to bring Serbs home.</p>
        <p>The leader of the United Nations mission in Kosovo, Dr. Bernard Kouchner, made the new drift clear last week when he endorsed the idea in front of a visiting Security Council delegation. ''We are all in favor of Serbs returning,'' he said, announcing the creation of a committee to coordinate the returns. ''We need them back, we want them back, but please without any adventure.''</p>
        <p>The United States and other Western nations have lent impetus to the idea, apparently seeking to win the political cooperation of the Serbs and to counter persistent criticism that while they helped nearly a million Albanian refugees return to Kosovo last year, they have presided over a violent exodus of more than 200,000 Serbs, Gypsies and other minorities.</p>
        <p>The showcase project favored by the Americans is for 500 Serbs to return to the village of Osojane in northwestern Kosovo. The $5 million plan will involve building a road to provide Serbs with safe access and complete reconstruction of the village, which was razed after the villagers fled last June. Spanish peacekeeping troops will provide security.</p>
        <p>British troops are undertaking a more discreet effort in central Kosovo, repairing road and rail links and houses in a ring of Serbian villages around the capital, Pristina.</p>
        <p>The United Nations high commissioner for refugees plans to return thousands of Gypsies to several towns around Kosovo. Widely accused of collaborating with the Serbs in the expulsion and killing of Albanians last year, 30,000 Gypsies fled and now live in guarded camps in Kosovo or neighboring territories.</p>
        <p>Albanian leaders have accepted the plan after Gypsy leaders acknowledged that some Gypsies had been involved in crimes against humanity, said the chief of the United Nations refugee mission in Kosovo, Dennis McNamara.</p>
        <p>The return of Serbs is, however, far more explosive, and Mr. McNamara and others have strong reservations. ''It is too early to bring back refugees at this stage,'' said the chief of one international aid organization in Pristina. A colleague added, ''The level of ethnic hatred between Albanians and Serbs in Kosovo is far greater than anything I have seen elsewhere in the Balkans.''</p>
        <p>Another refugee official, Paula Ghedini, noted that newspapers are full of memorial notices for Albanians killed last year, more than 1,000 are still imprisoned elsewhere in Serbia, and the war crimes tribunal in The Hague has recently resumed excavating suspected mass graves.</p>
        <p>''We would not normally return refugees to an ongoing conflict situation,'' Mr. McNamara said. ''If it is done early, without cooperation, it could trigger off a violent reaction,'' he added, while acknowledging the political momentum for return.</p>
        <p>Mr. McNamara's agency has been on the receiving end of violence, most recently last weekend in the Serbian part of the northern town of Mitrovica, when six peacekeepers and one policeman were injured, 39 vehicles of international groups damaged and four houses and one warehouse burned in protests at the return of Albanian refugees.</p>
        <p>Local Serbs have different reasons for pushing the returns. Bishop Artemije, the leader of the Serbian National Council, has made better treatment of Serbs a condition for joining Albanian leaders in the administration set up by the United Nations.</p>
        <p>Serbian leaders in north Mitrovica broke with the bishop over his willingness to do that, but still seek the political prestige that will attach to any successful return.</p>
        <p>Marko Jaksic, who worked with the bishop on returns until recently, said the Serbs cannot wait. ''If we wait, these people will never come back, and that will play in favor of the Albanians, allowing them to establish their own independent country,'' he said. ''They have one rule here: with fewer Serbs it is much easier to go for independence.''</p>
