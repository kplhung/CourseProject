        <p>He Sleeps With Bankers</p>
        <p>Q. A tablet in the perimeter wall at the New York Marble Cemetery lists ''Preserved Fish'' as an Old New Yorker interred within. Who was he, and what was his real name?</p>
        <p>A. As his burial among Beekmans, Varicks and Hoyts suggests, Preserved Fish was a prominent banker and merchant in early-19th-century New York. ''Preserved,'' which is pronounced with three syllables, is an old and very real Quaker name that means ''preserved in a state of grace'' or ''preserved from sin,'' according to Jay William Frost, director of the Friends Historical Library at Swarthmore College; the Fishes were a well-known Quaker family in 17th- and 18th-century New England.</p>

        <p>He Sleeps With Bankers</p>
        <p>Q. A tablet in the perimeter wall at the New York Marble Cemetery lists ''Preserved Fish'' as an Old New Yorker interred within. Who was he, and what was his real name?</p>
        <p>A. As his burial among Beekmans, Varicks and Hoyts suggests, Preserved Fish was a prominent banker and merchant in early-19th-century New York. ''Preserved,'' which is pronounced with three syllables, is an old and very real Quaker name that means ''preserved in a state of grace'' or ''preserved from sin,'' according to Jay William Frost, director of the Friends Historical Library at Swarthmore College; the Fishes were a well-known Quaker family in 17th- and 18th-century New England.</p>
        <p>Born in Portsmouth, R.I., in 1766, Preserved Fish worked as a merchant and a whaling captain out of New Bedford, Mass., before moving to New York City in the early 1800's. With his cousin Joseph Grinnell, he sold whale oil, acquired ships and organized packet lines to Liverpool and London. In 1829 Fish became president of the Tradesman's Bank, and joined the Whig Party, which embraced nativism. Like many Quakers who gained power and wealth in the young New York City, Fish became an Episcopalian before his death, in 1846.</p>
        <p>The cemetery, on Second Avenue between East Second and Third Streets, was the city's first nonsectarian graveyard, built as a commercial venture after burials were outlawed south of Canal Street.</p>
        <p>Proud to Be on the Bag</p>
        <p>Q. The cashier at my deli gives me my coffee in a white paper bag. A name is always stamped on the bottom of the bag in small block letters. The name changes every few days; today it was ''Sharon Washington.'' What's going on?</p>
        <p>A. Sharon Washington -- like Maria Rodrigues, Duilian Morales and more than 200 others -- is an automatic bag-machine tender at S &amp; G Packaging in Elizabeth, N.J.</p>
        <p>Machine tenders at the factory have long been required to print their name, or at least part of it, on each bag, along with their shift, the date and a factory identification number. ''It assures that they're going to take that extra step, to make sure the quality is there,'' said Karl Kalkbrenner, the general manufacturing manager at the Elizabeth plant.</p>
        <p>Starting with a giant roll of white or brown kraft paper, the bag machines print, fold, cut, glue, stack, wrap and bundle millions of bags a day; they are shipped to New England, North Carolina and as far west as the Great Lakes. Wearing ear plugs and goggles, machine tenders thread the paper and check for cuts and open flaps in each bag, making as many as 200,000 in an eight-hour shift. The factory operates around the clock, and ships a ''significant portion'' of its output to New York City, Mr. Kalkbrenner said.</p>
        <p>He said he did not know if S &amp; G was the first company to have employees sign their bags, or how many others had adopted the practice, but the Elizabeth plant has followed the rule ''religiously'' for over five years. ''I'm not aware of any negative reaction,'' Mr. Kalkbrenner said. ''There was no big response. It's like if you're not willing to put your name on the bag, you can't be very proud of what you make.''</p>
        <p>The Last One Out</p>
        <p>Q. Are any manned lighthouses still in operation in New York City?</p>
        <p>A. One, on Beach 47th Street on the western end of Coney Island, in Sea Gate. The lighthouse, about 85 feet high, was built for the Coast Guard in 1890, and will become fully automated after Frank Schubert, the current lighthouse keeper, retires. Mr. Schubert, 84, has been at the station since 1960. ''They keep me around for public relations,'' Mr. Schubert said.</p>

        <p>Correction:  May 14, 2000, Sunday  A report in the F.Y.I. column last Sunday about a 19th-century New Yorker named Preserved Fish misstated his burial place. It is the New York City Marble Cemetery; the New York Marble Cemetery is one block away.</p>
