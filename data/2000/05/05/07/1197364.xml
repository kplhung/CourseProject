        <p>WHEN the directors of the Opera Theater of St. Louis, the innovative summer festival company, began planning this year's 25th-anniversary season, the idea of presenting Scott Joplin's ''Treemonisha'' as the opening production seemed a natural.</p>
        <p>Joplin, who was born in Texarkana, Tex., around 1868, moved to St. Louis in 1885 and lived in the region for most of the next 20 years, becoming the acknowledged king of ragtime but also working to broaden his range as a composer. There he founded the short-lived Scott Joplin Ragtime Opera Company and oversaw the production of his first opera, ''A Guest of Honor,'' now lost. (He may have destroyed it in a fit of frustration.)</p>
        <p>It was in St. Louis that Joplin conceived, and largely composed, ''Treemonisha,'' a tender story of a black community on a plantation abandoned to its former slaves in Reconstruction-era Arkansas. The title character is a young woman who becomes the leader of her people by virtue of her education. Though the music is gently imbued with ragtime here and there, the wistful score aspires to genuine operatic richness. There is a large role for chorus, and the dialogue is delivered in Joplin's homespun brand of recitative.</p>
        <p>And yet the directors of the Opera Theater hesitated for some time about presenting ''Treemonisha'' (which opens on May 20) out of concern for the text, which is riddled with what audiences might today consider demeaning stereotypes and dated dialogue.</p>
        <p>Still, ''Treemonisha'' remains an affecting and authentic work, touched by elements of the composer's hard early life. Joplin was one of six children born to an ex-slave father, who had once fiddled for his master's parties, and a freeborn mother, who sang songs and played the banjo. The young Joplin's talent for piano improvisation astonished his Texarkana neighbors.</p>
        <p>His life course was set when, legend has it, a German immigrant heard the boy and offered to give him piano and harmony lessons. The composer never forgot the transforming power of education. No doubt because he felt so close to the characters in his opera, Joplin decided to write the text himself. It represents his honest effort to capture the speech of his people.</p>
        <p>But reading the words can make you squirm. As the opera begins, Zodzetrick, a local ''conjuring man'' who takes advantage of people's superstitious natures, approaches Monisha, the gullible mother of young Treemonisha, with an offer:</p>
        <p>I want to sell you dis bag o' luck,</p>
        <p>Yo' enemies it will keep away.</p>
        <p>Over yo' front do' you can hang it,</p>
        <p>An' good luck will come each day.</p>
        <p>Monisha is tempted. Perhaps the good-luck bag could prevent her husband Ned's ''booze drinkin'.'' But Ned intervenes: ''No, dat bag you'se not gwine to buy.''</p>
        <p>What is to be done with such lyrics? The problem is hardly limited to ''Treemonisha.'' Many once popular musical theater works can seem sexist, racist or worse when viewed through modern sensibilities. In recent years, two Broadway revivals grappled with this problem quite publicly: Irving Berlin's ''Annie Get Your Gun,'' with its arguably racist caricatures of Indians, and Frank Loesser's ''How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,'' with its blase sexism.</p>
        <p>Producers considering revivals of works with dated sensibilities essentially have three choices: present it as written, hoping that the audience will accept the work in context; alter it by changing or even excising the offending bits; or just give up.</p>
        <p>The Houston Grand Opera confronted the problem when it presented the first fully professional production of ''Treemonisha'' in 1975, directed by Frank Corsaro and conducted by the esteemed composer Gunther Schuller, who also orchestrated the score. (Joplin's orchestrations do not survive; Mr. Schuller's will be performed in St. Louis.) The Houston cast was excellent, and the performance, later recorded by Deutsche Grammophon, was hailed as sensitive and beautiful.</p>
        <p>Yet the production team in Houston, uneasy about the text, decided to clean it up. Every ''dis,''  ''dat'' and ''de'' was removed; phrases like ''dis bag o' luck'' became ''this bag of luck.'' To Gerald Early, a professor of modern literature who holds a joint appointment in the English and the African-American studies programs at Washington University in St. Louis, the Houston team's well-intentioned solution wound up blurring a linguistic distinction that was critical to Joplin's conception.</p>
        <p>In the opera we learn that Treemonisha was abandoned as a newborn and discovered under a tree by the childless Monisha and her husband Ned, who adopted the baby. Treemonisha's parents arranged to do chores for a nearby white family; in exchange, the lady of the house would educate their precious daughter, a story line that touchingly parallels Joplin's life. When the opera opens, Treemonisha is a quietly confident woman of 18; she and an older family friend, Remus, are the only characters who speak in standard English.</p>
        <p>Professor Early believes that by cleaning up the dialect, the Houston presenters blunted the opera's impact, he writes in a perceptive essay for the St. Louis production's program book.</p>
        <p>''Treemonisha seemed less radically removed from the others in the community,'' he says, ''because everyone's language has been, to some degree, homogenized.'' The message still came through in the Houston version, he adds, but ''the question remains whether Joplin's language, his artistic vision, should be changed to suit current fashion.''</p>
        <p>THE St. Louis production promises to be faithful to the original text. ''We debated what to do,'' Charles MacKay, the company's general director, said recently by telephone. ''But we wanted to honor Joplin's intentions.''</p>
        <p>Adapting material to suit current fashions has more often been the solution when Broadway producers bring back problematic musicals in costly revivals. But sometimes the changes just make matters worse, as in the current revival of ''Annie Get Your Gun.''</p>
        <p>Peter Stone, who revised the original 1946 book, and Graciela Daniele, who directed, tried to rid the show of any vestiges of material that might be politically embarrassing today. The song ''I'm an Indian Too'' was eliminated entirely. It was obviously determined that a contemporary Annie could not sing the lyrics: ''Just like Battle Ax, Hatchet Face, Eagle Nose,/ Like those Indians, I'm an Indian too.''</p>
        <p>Fair enough. The song is quaint at best, hurtful at worst, and not worth salvaging. But the revival goes further, adding a ''racist buffoon of a villain,'' as the New York Times critic Ben Brantley wrote last year. This is Dolly, the assistant to the marksman Frank Butler in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. The audience is invited to tut-tut at Dolly's racism and root for Bernadette Peters as Annie, who, with her poor-gal country wisdom, condemns such blanket prejudice. It's all very forced and phony.</p>
        <p>And in correcting the offense of the Indian song, this muddled revival misses the point of the original show. In its time the song was a vehicle for Ethel Merman, the bossy, brassy Queen of Broadway, to poke fun at her own image by pretending to be some old vaudeville spoof of an Indian. Removing the more dated material would have been one thing. But replacing it with force-fed pieties about tolerance saps the original show of its impish energy.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, the 1995 revival of ''How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,'' directed by Des McAnuff, found a workable solution to the undeniable sexism of the 1961 original. Back then, corporate climbing was an all-male contest. The audience would have been amused that virtually all the female characters were subservient secretaries or sexpots.</p>
        <p>Mr. McAnuff boldly decided to leave the original material essentially alone. Even the songs ''Happy to Keep His Dinner Warm'' and ''A Secretary Is Not a Toy'' were kept. But with the secretaries skillfully directed to be wry, knowing, tough-talking women, the revival had a new, modern subtext: the only people doing any work at the World Wide Wicket Company were the secretaries; the male executives were pompous, pampered nitwits.</p>
        <p>''The Fantasticks,'' the cult musical still running in the tiny Sullivan Street Playhouse in Greenwich Village, has undergone some cleaning-up since its 1960 premiere. But in this case, Tom Jones, who wrote the book and lyrics, was around to make the alterations.</p>
        <p>The original musical included a song about rape, ''It Depends on What You Pay.'' Two fathers who want their offspring, an inhibited young man and an impressionable young woman, to fall in love and marry, have concocted a plan: they hire the mysterious stranger El Gallo to stage an attempted rape. The man will save the woman; she will be swept away by her new hero. Happy ending.</p>
        <p>In the opening line of the song, as introduced by Jerry Orbach, El Gallo asked the fathers what kind of rape they wished to order:</p>
        <p>We've the obvious, open schoolboy rape,</p>
        <p>With little mandolins and perhaps a cape.</p>
        <p>The rape by coach; it's little in request.</p>
        <p>The rape by day, but the rape by night is best.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones said recently, ''I don't know why none of us thought of this problem at the time.'' But during the 1970's, he grew increasingly bothered by the song. By the 1980's, ''as everyone's consciousness got raised,'' Mr. Jones said, he was actively campaigning to change it. Interestingly, the producers resisted. Mr. Jones wrote entirely new lyrics for some existing music. The new song was rejected. Finally a compromise was reached.</p>
        <p>The lyrics of the existing song were altered: the word ''rape'' was replaced by ''abduction.'' (''You can get a rape emphatic'' became ''An abduction that's emphatic.'') And Mr. Jones provided a lead-in speech for the song to make clear that the abduction was a literary conceit, not a real act.</p>
        <p>I  FEEL happy with the compromise,'' Mr. Jones said. ''The original had been a cheap shot.'' It is hard for a creator to see a work frozen, he added. ''They have to restrain me all the time. I constantly want to rewrite 'The Fantasticks.' ''</p>
        <p>Were he alive, Joplin might feel similarly about ''Treemonisha.'' He wanted the work to depict rural blacks realistically as he knew them to be. But realism in musical theater is elusive. Hearing a cultivated operatic voice sing a line like ''Dis here bag will heaps o' luck bring'' can be odd and incongruous.</p>
        <p>Rhoda Levine, the director of the St. Louis production, while defending the decision to present the work as written, has been encouraging the singers to soften the pronunciation of the words, she said, to make them more available to audiences. The visionary quality of ''Treemonisha,'' she suggested, is not fully appreciated.</p>
        <p>''That this community of people would see a young, black educated woman as an inspiring leader shows incredible sensitivity on Joplin's part,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Levine sees parallels between the conjurers in the opera and drug dealers today, all of whom entice vulnerable people with false fantasies of intense experiences and security. Her production, Ms. Levine said, will unflinchingly portray the gritty poverty of this rural black community.</p>
        <p>Joplin would undoubtedly be deeply gratified that the major work of his life is now taken so seriously. In 1915, having moved to New York, depressed over his inability to steer ''Treemonisha'' into production and afflicted with syphilis, he presented a private concert performance of the score in a Harlem rehearsal hall. Nothing came of it. His mental state deteriorated. In 1916 his wife committed him to Manhattan State Hospital. Joplin died there the next year.</p>
        <p>The mezzo-soprano Betty Allen, president emeritus of the Harlem School for the Arts, sang the role of Monisha in the Houston production and reveres the work.</p>
        <p>''The man did wonderfully with what he knew at the time,'' Ms. Allen said. ''To give us this young woman as a fighter for human rights and education -- it was just incredible. I don't feel 'Treemonisha' needs any defending.''</p>
        <p>Nor any changes, the creative team in St. Louis would add.</p>
