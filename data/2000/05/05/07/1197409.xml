        <p>FASTER than you can say switchblade, and with little more than a week to go before the opening curtain, ''Three Penny Opera'' got a new Ballad Singer. Mike Harvey has replaced the hip-hop artist Cee-Lo (who canceled at the last minute for personal reasons).</p>
        <p>''Three Penny Opera'' is the ambitious joint production of the Connecticut Grand Opera and Orchestra and the Stamford Center for the Arts. The show opened at the Palace Theater in Stamford yesterday, and will continue through Saturday.</p>
        <p>Found through a opera company cast member, Mr. Harvey has been a session singer, composer and arranger whose voice and jingles are heard in the United States and abroad. Mr. Harvey, who is 32 and lives in New York, has sung background vocals most recently on tour with Seal, and has sung with Steely Dan, Al Jarreau, Roberta Flack and Bette Midler. He has also appeared on television and has his own band in New York. ''Three Penny'' marks his professional theatrical debut.</p>
        <p>Two days after he saw the script, Mr. Harvey talked about the show during a break from rehearsal. ''It's a whole new experience for me,'' he said in a phone conversation. ''I think every singer wants to be an actor, and every actor wants to be a singer. I knew very little about 'Three Penny Opera.' I just got it yesterday.''</p>
        <p>In this production, his character (who serves as the narrator) is a crackhead. ''I just got the pipe today, we're using rock salt as the crack,'' he said. ''I accidentally lit it for real, and the very end of the pipe burst into flame. It's a new thing,'' he chuckled.</p>
        <p>Mr. Harvey, who described his music as ''Stevie Wonder meets the Beatles,'' will get the show going with rap-style vocal percussion (known as ''beat box''). How will he sing ''Mack the Knife''? ''I'm going to give a hip-hop feeling to it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Although the 1928 work by Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill is a re-interpretation of John Gay's ''Beggar's Opera,'' written 200 years earlier, its elements of political satire and commentary on world conditions resonate in contemporary society. The story, originally British, adapted by Germans and re-adapted into colloquial American, retains its appeal of delivering a heavy message with light music.</p>
        <p>The director, Paula Suozzi, has selected the translation of Michael Feingold (also used for the recent Broadway engagement starring Sting).</p>
        <p>''The language in this translation is much more modern,'' said Ms. Suozzi, during rehearsal in a church in downtown Stamford. ''The Ballad Singer -- that role by its nature --  can sit outside the world in which the piece takes place. Having someone like Mike Harvey from a different field works very well.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Suozzi continued: ''I've tried to consistently find images that the audience will recognize. The criminal element -- Macheath and his gang, very street wise -- are in modern clothing like battle fatigues; their weapons are guns and knives. ''I think the relationship between the police and the beggars -- it's actually kind of frightening -- it's so prescient to what's going on now. Considering that this was originally conceived of 200 years ago, people haven't changed much,'' she said.</p>
        <p>During another rehearsal break, Robert Evan (who performed the title roles in the original Broadway production of ''Jekyll and Hyde'') said that he had been told he was perfect for the Macheath villain role: ''It's another psychopath!'' And as Jean Valjean, Mr. Evan led the national tour of ''Les Miserables'' to Broadway in 1996.</p>
        <p>''I love people thinking I'm a nice guy and when they see me work, they say, how do you do that?'' Mr. Evan, who lives in Irvington, N.Y., had never heard ''Three Penny Opera'' before. ''To me, this is a brand new show,'' he said. ''Musically, I'm trying -- I have a big voice -- I'm trying to tell the tale rather than sing the songs. I'll be more dark, breathy and cutting.''</p>
        <p>The Connecticut Grand Opera and Orchestra's general director and principal conductor, Laurence Gilgore, saw ''Three Penny Opera'' as a continuation of the company's past programming including avant-garde productions of Offenbach's ''Bluebeard's Castle'' and Mozart's ''Don Giovanni.''</p>
        <p>The executive director of the Stamford Center for the Arts, George E. Moredoch III, said he had wanted to bring musical theater into the theater series at the center. ''Three Penny Opera'' with a contemporary twist won him over. ''To marry Brecht opera with modern music like hip-hop and rap or whatever'' fascinated him, he said.</p>
        <p>''Three Penny Opera,'' Palace Theater, 61 Atlantic Street, Stamford. (203) 325-4466. Performances through Saturday.</p>
