        <p>TUFF</p>
        <p>By Paul Beatty.</p>
        <p>259 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Alfred A. Knopf. $23.</p>
        <p>''Winston, what do you look forward to?'' the Rabbi Spencer Throckmorton asks Winston Foshay, who's known as Tuffy, midway through Paul Beatty's viciously funny new novel. Tuffy, who has already served some jail time and recently survived a crack-house shooting by falling into a very sincere faint, responds: ''This documentary called 'Seven Up,' where they follow these British people around. But it only comes out once every seven years.'' And while Michael Apted's documentary series is a brilliant example of how the class system can stunt even the most imaginative and ambitious children, in ''Tuff'' Beatty offers up a sardonic portrait of how fate, and the selfish intervention of elders, can alter the course of a young person's life.</p>
        <p>Although the story takes place in New York's Spanish Harlem, Beatty and his characters are more likely to refer to Joseph Conrad and Michael Cimino than Biggie Smalls, and there is a charming tossed-off quality to these references, suggesting that there is no difference between the cultural osmosis of the more traditional ''classics'' and the culture passed off by hand on the streets. ''Once people knew you had a gun, it was like having a car -- everyone begging to borrow it, wanting you to use it to make their lives easier,'' Beatty observes, demonstrating his ability to write sentences that percolate not only with rhythm and attitude but also with a kind of transcendent observational truth. The author of a previous novel (''The White Boy Shuffle'') and two volumes of poetry, Beatty has a rare ability to fashion something more than just occasional sharp phrasing; word by word, sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph, the writing here is seamless and teeming with momentum.</p>
        <p>If ''Tuff'' has anything resembling a plot, it arrives when Tuffy gets talked into running for City Council, inspired by an offer of financial support from Inez Nomura, a Japanese political activist who was once a volunteer speechwriter for Malcolm X. From this point on the book is made up of Tuffy's ploys to gather signatures and votes, and these allow Beatty to vent his well-earned vitriol at any target he can stuff into the narrative.</p>
        <p>For all Beatty's powerful observations, it's hard to see a clear lesson or message beneath his work. From ''Tuff'' one gets the sense that nothing matters to Beatty any more than anything else, that there is nothing worthy of emotional investment or political belief. But maybe that's the point; it is possible that in an effort to be what the literary world embraces as admirably ''unsentimental'' Beatty has chosen to have no sentiment at all. At times it becomes difficult not to feel as Inez does, eavesdropping on Tuffy as he entertains his friends with plans for an imaginary Cap'n Crunch movie. ''Their glee was contagious, and she wanted to join them, but age and psychological distance immobilized her. She felt as if she were tied to the stake while the natives whooped and pranced.''</p>
        <p>And yet there are moments that suggest something more, such as this moving passage, dry as a bone, in which Tuffy recalls his childhood: ''It was underneath these boughs a 10-year-old Winston watched a group of boys rape and beat a jogger, kicking her motionless body into the mulberry bushes and leaving her for dead. When he was a little older he nearly decapitated bicyclists by knotting the ends of a section of fishing wire to carpenter nails, stretching the filament across the footpath and hammering the nails into the trees about shoulder high. At night the line was invisible . . . lifting the biker off the bicycle so cleanly, the riderless bike would coast straight down the hill and into the waiting hands of Winston and his friends. . . . Then Winston would begin to cry.''</p>
        <p>Because Beatty stops short of a conclusive ending, ''Tuff'' is ultimately a portrait of a promisingly blank slate, someone whose decisions are influenced by random events and fleeting alliances, someone whose intellect might not be his most practical asset and certainly is not all he needs to turn his life around. Someone who, it turns out, is just like the rest of us.</p>
