      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In 1853, when the federal government authorized five Army expeditions to survey the West for a transcontinental railroad route, there was a conspicuous absentee in the command structure: John C. Fremont, whose exploits in the Rockies and Sierra Nevada had captivated the nation's imagination. But Fremont's fourth western expedition, in the winter of 1848, had ended disastrously, with 10 of his men dead of cold or starvation, and he was passed over. Undeterred, Fremont mounted his own mission, with the foolhardy notion that he would make a wintertime passage across the mountains of Colorado, Utah, Nevada and California. Fremont also brought along a New York painter and photographer, Solomon Nunes Carvalho. The expedition failed in the snowy Wasatch Range of Utah, where the men froze and starved until they were saved by Mormon pioneers. Though the effort proved nothing in practical terms, it had passed through some of the most dramatic midwinter terrain in North America, and Carvalho captured an extraordinary visual record on the fragile copper plates of his daguerreotypes. Although the images were copied on steel engravings, the actual daguerreotypes were destroyed in 1881 along with Fremont's journals in a New York warehouse fire. In 1994 Robert Shlaer, a former biologist turned art photographer, who had mastered daguerreotypy, began a four-year odyssey to retrace the four-month-long Fremont expedition in a specially equipped darkroom van. He painstakingly reproduced Carvalho's images with the still difficult old process. SIGHTS ONCE SEEN: Daguerreotyping Fremont's Last Expedition Through the Rockies (Museum of New Mexico, $45), containing 126 haunting, finely-detailed modern daguerreotypes, depicts some of the West's wildest scenery, most of it virtually unchanged after 150 years. The illustrations are augmented by many period engravings, paintings by Carvalho, and a number of Shlaer's helpful but less artistic record shots. His text freely draws on historic sources as well as his equally fascinating attempts to identify unlabeled 1853 views and to duplicate exactly Carvalho's vantage points.</p>
