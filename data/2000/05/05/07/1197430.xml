        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Yet another in the seemingly endless articles, along with more letters to the editor, complaining about certain types of 20th-century music, and particularly the music of Arnold Schoenberg (and his followers), appeared in these pages on April 30 [''On Serialists and Their Bedfellows,'' Bernard Holland]. Isn't this topic getting kind of old? But then, I thought, maybe I'm just not getting it. Maybe this music really is as awful and as unrewarding as these folks say it is. So I played my old recording of the Schoenberg String Trio, by the Lenox Trio. Hmm, not too bad, I thought, but maybe I need to listen to another Schoenberg piece. So I played a recording of the Violin Concerto. Wow! I'm not wrong, I thought to myself again. These works are masterpieces, exciting works of art, as are many other 20th-century works; they are as vital and as rewarding as the masterworks of the distant and not too distant past. Reviewers, critics, dear letter writers: so you don't like this music; so you find it hard to listen to; so what? Enough already with your complaints about Schoenberg, Boulez, Babbitt, Carter and far too many other composers. Listen to whatever you want, but it really is time to move on.</p>
