        <p>ASK people how money is wasted in the health care system, and their tone of voice undergoes an interesting change.</p>
        <p>Doctors huff and puff about the squadrons of workers they have had to hire to meet the paperwork demands of managed care. Patients complain about the $60 they shell out for three-minute appointments during which doctors seem to do little more than blink at them. Insurance companies bemoan unnecessary tests.</p>
        <p>In fact, there are many quantifiable ways in which millions of health care dollars go up in smoke each year. Patients are complicit in the process, though they do not always know it. Doctors, insurance companies and policy experts each have a laundry list of ways that patients aid and abet waste, sometimes at the peril of their own health. Here are some of the problems they cite.</p>
        <p>UNNEEDED ANTIBIOTICS -- In rare agreement, doctors, insurers and scientists all say there is widespread, wasteful misuse of antibiotics. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta estimates that roughly 50 million unneeded prescriptions for antibiotics are dispensed each year.</p>
        <p>Why? Doctors say patients -- especially those who were up all night with a miserable child -- dislike going home empty-handed. Others demand the most expensive types of antibiotics even when they are not appropriate. And some doctors feel that while an antibiotic may not help a situation, it won't hurt, either.</p>
        <p>That attitude deeply concerns the C.D.C., which has seen a rapid increase in antibiotic-resistant infections, including those of the ear, urinary tract and respiratory system, in part because of antibiotic misuse.</p>
        <p>''I think the average person can help by understanding that antibiotics offer no benefit for colds and flu and viruses,'' said Dr. David M. Bell, who works on antibiotic resistance issues at the C.D.C. ''They should not  be disappointed when the doctor does not prescribe them, and they should not demand them.''</p>
        <p>PREVENTIVE SCREENINGS -- In theory, screenings are great, because finding and treating illnesses in early stages tends to be less expensive and more successful. But many people are screened for diseases they are at no real risk of contracting.</p>
        <p>Colon cancer experts, for example,  generally recommend waiting until the age of 50 to begin screening for the disease unless it runs in the family or a relative has developed it at 55 or younger. But the once-distasteful  colonoscopy has been promoted into  something of a rage among people who do not really need it, these experts say, eclipsing cheaper tests that may be more appropriate.</p>
        <p>''Katie Couric showing that the colonoscopy is a tolerable and accurate screening test is a good thing,'' said James E. Allison, a gastroenterologist at San Francisco General Hospital and investigator for Kaiser Permanente, a West Coast health maintenance organization. ''But the message should not be that average-risk people Katie's age should get a colonoscopy.''</p>
        <p>Others who do not need the procedure are the very elderly who have been screened in the past; those with terminal illnesses, though 30 percent of primary care doctors refer such  patients for the test anyway; and people who have had a benign polyp removed in the last five years, since there is only a remote chance it will come back, Dr. Allison said, citing studies by respected cancer centers.</p>
        <p>Looking at screenings more broadly, many experts say that far too many people get M.R.I. scans for lower back pain, and that unnecessary surgery and invasive tests often follow. A New England Journal of Medicine study from the mid-1990's found that as many as 85 percent of patients with lower back pain could not be given a definitive diagnosis.</p>
        <p>OVER-THE-COUNTER PRODUCTS -- Every doctor and managed-care executive has an example in this area. (Their views are their own, so manufacturers, save the angry letters.) Dr. Jack Swanson, a pediatrician in Ames, Iowa, and the chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics' committee on practice and ambulatory medicine, does not much care for vitamins for healthy children.</p>
        <p>''Most pediatricians don't think healthy children need extra vitamins, even the ones that are picky eaters,'' Dr. Swanson said. He also derides food additives for children with disabilities. ''I think parents see these things advertised and think they are important to use,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Oddly, no one mentioned the mental-health cost of reading really tacky magazines in the doctor's waiting room. But the patient's role in that, of course, is elective.</p>
