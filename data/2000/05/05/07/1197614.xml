        <p>THINK of cellular telephones, and you perhaps conjure up thoughts of the man at the movie whose pocket starts ringing at a gripping moment of drama, teenagers chatting in front of their school or the woman at the video store reading movie titles to her jaded friend.</p>
        <p>Last week, officials in New York City had a different idea. Responding to the killings of nine livery cabbies this year, they announced that a program originally designed to distribute cell phones to potential crime victims would be expanded to include the drivers. The program, which was first devised for victims of domestic violence, gave away 500 phones, all programmed to dial 911.</p>
        <p>Formerly viewed as a luxury item, these phones have become commonplace in the last 15 years, and since the early 1990's they have increasingly been regarded as an all-purpose cure-all for individual safety. Today the notion of being wired in the electronic age is shared not only by parent and child, but also by salesman and client, cop and felon. Less certain is whether people are really connected, really secure, or merely think they are.</p>
        <p>In Phoenix, the Arizona Foundation for Women is sponsoring a local drive to give cellular phones to victims of domestic abuse. In Winthrop, Me., the police have programmed cell phones to dial 911 and the friends and relatives of women who have been attacked by their spouses and companions. In 1994, the New York Police Department gave phones to crime-watch volunteers in two dangerous parks. ''We don't need knives and guns and Mace,'' Michael Julian, the department's chief of personnel, said at the time. ''We need a way to call for help.''</p>
        <p>The University of Maryland at College Park offers discounts to students wanting to buy such phones. In part, the program was established for the safety of the students, university officials say. Parents also often give phones to children heading off to college.</p>
        <p>Kevin Davitt, a spokesman for the district attorney's office in Brooklyn, where a recent rise in murders has been linked to domestic violence, said such phones were not the answer to every problem. But, Mr. Davitt added, ''For a victim, it removes the isolation and the terror that often assists the perpetrator.''</p>
        <p>''Most of these crimes happen one on one,'' he added, ''but this puts a kind of electronic third person in the situation.''</p>
        <p>Since 1983, more than 80 million Americans have purchased cell phones. A recent federal report noted that the sense of security offered by cell phones is a major factor in the accelerated growth of the industry.</p>
        <p>More than 500,000 calls are placed to 911 and other emergency numbers through cell phones each month in the United States, according to industry reports. And nearly half the callers say they have used the phones to report crime, car trouble, drunk drivers or medical emergencies.</p>
        <p>BUT to Fernando A. Mateo, president of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers, New York City's effort to get the devices to each livery cab driver is an example of a good idea gone too far and a waste of energy and resources.</p>
        <p>''When you have someone in the car with a gun to your head,'' Mr. Mateo said last week, ''for you to  dial 911 and be able to speak will be pretty tough. By the time the drivers finish answering all the questions, they will be dead.''</p>
        <p>Others, however, argue that the presence of cell phones in the cabs might discourage criminals from singling out drivers, who are being required to install bulletproof partitions that separate the front seat of the car from the back. A criminal sociologist at San Diego State University, William C. Kennedy, said perception in crime fighting is often as important as reality, noting that cell phones make people feel safer -- whether on highways and in alleys -- and may make criminals more hesitant to strike.</p>
        <p>Professor Kennedy said that once a crime is under way, the phones often do little more than create ''a false impression of safety.'' Some people ''say they would never walk down a certain street without their cell phone,'' he said. ''Unless you are going to use it has a hammer, it is probably not going to do you much good.''</p>
        <p>Most criminals act quickly, preventing people from using their phones to call for help, he said. The phones are most effectively used to report crimes being committed against another person, Professor Kennedy said.</p>
        <p>To many young people, a cellular phone is the latest high-tech toy offering entree into the cool club, much like the beeper craze of the last decade. But others see it is as essential for safety.</p>
        <p>Jaimie Kent, a 21-year-old Duke University junior from River Vale, N.J., bought her cell phone about four years ago, around the same time she received her driver's license. ''It was mainly a safety thing -- just when I was driving on the highways by myself,'' Ms. Kent said in an interview last week. ''I could call if my car broke down.''</p>
        <p>On Jan. 3, 1999, while home on winter break, Ms. Kent was driving on a rural road when, she said, she ''literally got a stomach flu that came over me as I was driving home and I started to pull over to stop, and I blacked out.''</p>
        <p>THE next thing she remembered was the sound of tapping. ''Someone was knocking on my window, I woke up, and she was able to use my cell phone to call my mom,'' Ms. Kent said. It took all the strength she could muster, Ms. Kent added, to give her Good Samaritan the telephone number to reach Ms. Kent's mother, who came to get her.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kent understands the limitations of her phone, she said. But regardless of whether it will protect her from a criminal, she says she sees it, in many ways, as her digital security blanket.</p>
