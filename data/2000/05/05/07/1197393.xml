        <p>KYLE D. PRUETT, 56, is a new dad again. Olivia, his 16-month-old daughter, is teaching him a great deal about his field. Dr. Pruett, a psychiatrist and associate clinical professor at the Yale Child Study Center, has written widely on the role of fathers. His new book, ''Fatherneed, Why Father Care is as Essential as Mother Care for Your Child'' (Free Press) was released in January.</p>
        <p>He causes a stir when he takes Olivia into the men's rooms at airports to change her diapers. Recently when he did this he was observed by three males. ''One teen said, 'That looks cool. That doesn't look that hard and she's cute.' A second, in his late 40's, said, 'There were no places like this when I was raising my kids.' And another older man said, 'This is a generation that is going to get a lot out of men like you. I wasn't the kind of father I wish I had been.' '' Dr. Pruett said he delighted in such encounters.</p>
        <p>He said his two older children have made him a better father. ''Parenting is on-the-job training. It is the child who really turns you into a parent.''</p>
        <p>Following are excerpts from a conversation with him about the role of fathers:</p>
        <p>Q.:How can a man become a good father?</p>
        <p>A.:Have some skills ready by the time your child comes along. Know how to bathe and feed them because it is in those everyday moments of holding and rocking your baby and getting thrown up on, getting up in the middle of the night, that you get to know your child. It happens at the sensory level. It is not done from afar. You have to know how your child feels and smells in order to know them really well. You have to see your child's world through their eyes. It's important to know their friends and enemies, the things they fear and the things they love.</p>
        <p>Also, it's important that you be an emotionally viable being to your child. Talk with them about who you are. Talk to them about your work.</p>
        <p>Q.:What are some ways fathering changes as children grow older?</p>
        <p>A.:Don't overdo the father-son thing at the expense of your daughters. Keep your eyes and ears open around your children. Talk to them about drinking and about sex. Don't leave it to your wife. You can't imagine how powerful your opinions are to your children. The biggest threat to the father in America is divorce. Divorce is really about children. Only 34 percent of children born in the last three years of this century will reach the age of 18 living with both their biological parents.</p>
        <p>Q.:Why is the father's role changing?</p>
        <p>A.:It's very important to the women they love and care about. We do a lousy job as a society sustaining the nurturing interests of young boys. You see it in preschool. There are just as many boys as girls in the dress-up corner. Once children start joining their gender gangs, the boys with the boys, girls with girls, it disappears unless there is a countervailing value system that says boys look after this emotionally rich and tender part of yourself, it will be really handy to you down the road. It will not only be handy to you as an individual but it will be irresistible to the women in your life. The lives of the children that you raise will be enhanced.</p>
        <p>Q.:Should fathers assume the traditional role as disciplinarian?</p>
        <p>A.:It sets the father up as a bit of a cretin. All he does is come home and dispense justice. He's not entitled to his own emotional relationship with his child. It also sets him up in the child's eyes as someone who only smacks you around and tells you what to do. He's not a loving entity in his own right, he can't teach you anything. I think it's a way many women have established their own power and hegemony over the domestic domain. I do think there has been an unfortunate polarization from some of the forces of the conservative right that says fathers should be authoritarian. The problem with that is we know that better parenting styles that promote good development and relationships are authoritative, not authoritarian.</p>
        <p>Q.:Are men that important in the well-being of their child's lives?</p>
        <p>A.:An involved father does change children in a positive way. Children raised with a father who plays a role in their daily life stay in school longer. They are less involved in the juvenile justice system. They tend to marry later and tend to have their first sexual experience later. When they do marry, they stay married longer. They have fewer job changes over the course of their lives. They have stronger problem-solving skills. They do less gender stereotyping.</p>
        <p>The other side of this is what does having children do for men? Men who have been involved as fathers live longer. They die much less frequently from accidents and from suicide. Their overall health is slightly better. They are better workers. They tend to stay in their intimate relationships longer. There is something very sustaining of a physical and emotional nature when involved in the life of your child.</p>
        <p>Q.:How serious is the issue of absent fathers?</p>
        <p>A.:Deadbeat dads get an absurdly large share of media coverage in terms of absent paternity. For every one of those guys that shows up on a post office wall there are thousands of men doing the best they can. It may not satisfy the State of Connecticut but if they are involved in the life of their child, their kids are going to feel he did his best. We have to be careful about the political stuff. The way to get children out of poverty is not by making fathers pay. If all the fathers in the United States paid their child support you still would not have enough money to lift vast numbers of children out of poverty. There is a little too much enthusiasm for punishment and retribution, and not enough clear thinking about what those families really need. The fathers need jobs, help getting over their shame, support in reconnecting with their children, and the mothers need support in allowing them to return to nurturing interactions with their children.</p>
