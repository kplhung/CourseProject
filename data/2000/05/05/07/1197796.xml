        <p>It's sleepy time down South in Robert B. Parker's HUGGER MUGGER (Putnam, $23.95), until his Boston private eye, Spenser, heads for rural Georgia to investigate the baffling attacks on thoroughbred racehorses at Three Fillies Stables. ''I felt like I had just wandered into a Johnny Mercer lyric,'' cracks Spenser, who also has witty words for the local climate, cuisine and intelligence quotient. But the Southerners give it right back. Spenser's ''Northern charm'' is dismissed as ''an oxymoron'' by his client's sassy daughter. The deputy sheriff drolly assures him that ''nothing makes us dumb Southern boys happier than having a smart Yankee show up to help us.''

        <p>It's sleepy time down South in Robert B. Parker's HUGGER MUGGER (Putnam, $23.95), until his Boston private eye, Spenser, heads for rural Georgia to investigate the baffling attacks on thoroughbred racehorses at Three Fillies Stables. ''I felt like I had just wandered into a Johnny Mercer lyric,'' cracks Spenser, who also has witty words for the local climate, cuisine and intelligence quotient. But the Southerners give it right back. Spenser's ''Northern charm'' is dismissed as ''an oxymoron'' by his client's sassy daughter. The deputy sheriff drolly assures him that ''nothing makes us dumb Southern boys happier than having a smart Yankee show up to help us.'' And the gay clientele at the Bath House Bar and Grill turn out to be so tough they don't need our brawny hero to settle a brawl.</p>
        <p>All this culture shock brings out a certain waggishness in Spenser, who is fascinated by the elaborately staged lives of the horsy set and more amused than appalled by the character flaws he uncovers beneath all the polite gentility. Without compromising his expert sleuthing techniques (''blunder around, ask questions, get in people's way, be annoying''), he manages to pick up enough regional skills to communicate with the devious natives in their own idiom -- and catch them at their own wicked games.</p>
        <p>What do you call a legal thriller that is populated by ghosts and madmen and features a protagonist who is having a spectacular nervous breakdown? LOST GIRLS (Delacorte, $23.95), an elegantly written debut novel by Andrew Pyper, follows standard procedures for a legal thriller,</p>
        <p>in that it presents a Toronto defense attorney named Barth Crane with his first homicide case (''dirty, ugly and unwinnable'') and dispatches him to the cold North Country (''an interminable expanse of humanlessness'') for his comeuppance. Once he meets his mentally shattered client, a schoolteacher accused of killing two students whose bodies have yet to be found, there is also ample opportunity for the arrogant lawyer to redeem his own morally bankrupt soul -- another staple device for books of this kind.</p>
        <p>But from then on, everything about this dark, disquieting story confounds expectations. Unnerved by his isolation and haunted by the local myth of a mysterious Lady who lives in the depths of Lake St. Christopher, where the missing schoolgirls were presumed drowned, Barth becomes unhinged. Talking to himself in tones of corrosive sarcasm, he broods on the dead, keeps returning to the lake and loses himself in horrid visions of ''black-eyed girls in ragged dresses and bare feet'' who beckon to him from the corners of his mind. It's hard to say exactly what kind of tale Pyper has told, but there's no doubt that he has told it brilliantly.</p>
        <p>One by one, the three women in Nicci French's insinuating tale of sexual obsession, BENEATH THE SKIN (Mysterious Press/Warner, $24.95), will walk into the arms of the murderous sadist who is stalking them. But before they do, each one will discover something about herself -- that special something that makes her irresistible to a psychopath. ''I've been passive,'' says Zoe, a young nursery-school teacher whose life loses its focus after she breaks up with a boyfriend. ''I think it was to do with being in London,'' she tells a friend. ''I wanted to be lost. I didn't want anyone to notice me.'' Jenny, a former model with perfectionist views on marriage and motherhood, comes to realize that the emotional prison she has made of her life is an open invitation to predators. Only Nadia, with her flexible mind and disorderly life, thinks she's got a chance. ''I was going to fight,'' she vows -- to the delight of her secret watcher.</p>
        <p>Nicci French (the pseudonym of the British journalists Nicci Gerrard and Sean French) gives the killer terrifying presence through the perverse ''love'' letters he sends to his victims. (''I want to see inside you, and then I want to kill you.'') But, in a stylistic twist that is rare for this genre, the focus of the suspense remains locked on his victims, smart, articulate women who reveal their escalating fears in intimate first-person narratives that are insightful and also sad, because the lessons learned come too late.</p>
        <p>Gabriel Du Pre, the plain-spoken, deep-thinking Montana cattle inspector in Peter Bowen's earthy mysteries, gets his marching orders in THE STICK GAME (St. Martin's Minotaur, $23.95) from an old medicine man. ''Take care, your people,'' the sage tells him. ''Be a warrior.'' Du Pre, who is descended from a Canadian tribe of wanderers, not warriors, can't save a brain-damaged teenager who throws himself down a well; but he can help other children by going after the gold-mining company that is poisoning the water supply on the Fort Belknap Reservation. Bowen's rock-hewn hero is a solid man with lusty appetites who loves red meat, liquor and tobacco, plays a smoking fiddle and is faithful to his woman. But a shrewd mind and wry sense of humor assert themselves eloquently in an austere tribal idiom that eschews such fluff as prepositions and rarely departs from the present tense of language -- and of life.</p>
        <p>It's tempting to read Robert Barnard's discreetly mannered suspense story A MURDER IN MAYFAIR (Scribner, $23) as a parable of British party politics. When Colin Pinnock becomes a junior minister in the new Labor government, he is full of promise and resolve, until a curt message on a grubby postcard -- Who do you think you are?'' -- challenges all his assumptions about himself. ''It was almost like asking you what you thought the point of existence was,'' says Colin, whose researches into his past lead him to believe that he was the child of an adulterous politician who disappeared after murdering his wife. Barnard is meticulous about building up the suspense as Colin is hounded by the faceless fury bent on ending, or at least ruining, his blameless life. But there's more nasty fun in reading the story as the revenge of the ousted Tories on the cheeky whippersnappers who think they can keep their integrity, not to mention their sanity, once they start playing politics for real.</p>
