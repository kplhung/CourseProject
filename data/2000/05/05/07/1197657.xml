        <p>An Iraqi doctor who worked with the Central Intelligence Agency against Saddam Hussein, only to be jailed for nearly four years on the basis of secret C.I.A. evidence, may soon be free, his lawyer said this week.</p>
        <p>Dr. Ali Yasin Mohammed Karim was evacuated from Iraq to the United States in 1996 after the collapse of a C.I.A. plot against Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader. He was summarily jailed in California on the basis of reports compiled by the intelligence agency and presented by the Federal Bureau of Investigation to an immigration judge.</p>
        <p>But the judge, D. D. Sitgraves, ruled this week that lawyers for the jailed Iraqi now have presented ''more than sufficient evidence'' to rebut the government's claim that he should be deported as a threat to national security.</p>
        <p>The judge, who was rehearing the case, essentially reversed her original 1998 decision, a 92-page ruling based almost entirely on secret government evidence. That ruling was withheld from Dr. Karim's lawyers on national-security grounds.</p>
        <p>The use of secret evidence, once exceedingly rare, has become increasingly common in cases involving government claims of national security. In November, a federal district judge in New York freed an Egyptian man jailed for three and a half years on the basis of secret evidence.</p>
        <p>But in October, in a case involving a Palestinian immigrant jailed for nearly four years, a federal district judge in New Jersey ruled, for the first time in the United States, that it was unconstitutional to detain an immigrant based on secret evidence.</p>
        <p>The immigration judge in the Palestinian's case called some of the government's secret evidence ''double or triple hearsay.'' Dr. Karim's lawyers say much the same in his case.</p>
        <p>Dr. Karim, a 37-year-old radiologist who worked with C.I.A.-backed Iraqi opposition groups, remains in jail, pending the judge's final decision, said one of his lawyers, Neils Frenzen.</p>
        <p>His wife divorced him after he was imprisoned and he does not know where his children are, or if he will see them again, Mr. Frenzen said.</p>
        <p>''He has lost the things most dear to him -- his freedom, his liberty, his family, his sons,'' Mr. Frenzen said.</p>
        <p>But the judge's ruling, handed down on Monday, means that Dr. Karim may be granted political asylum this month, Mr. Frenzen said.</p>
        <p>The secret evidence against Dr. Karim was withheld from Dr. Karim's lawyers, until a former director of central intelligence, R. James Woolsey, entered the case for the defense in 1998.</p>
        <p>Mr. Woolsey held security clearances sufficient to review the evidence, most of which the government finally declassified. Much of it was a series of suppositions by C.I.A. officers, based in part on hearsay, that Dr. Karim might have connections with Iranian intelligence.</p>
        <p>Upon reviewing the evidence, Mr. Woolsey called it ''nonsense.''</p>
        <p>Warren J. Marik, a retired C.I.A. case officer who was assigned to Iraq and worked with Dr, Karim, testified last month that ''there was nothing to bring any suspicion'' on him.</p>
        <p>Dr. Karim, an Iraqi Kurd, worked with the Iraqi National Congress, which played a central role in a $20-million-a-year set of C.I.A. operations that sought to undermine Saddam Hussein. The clandestine plots began shortly after the Persian Gulf war of 1991 and went on for five years, without success.</p>
        <p>In August 1996, the plots finally collapsed when the Iraqi military seized towns in northern Iraq that had served as bases for the plots. Dr. Karim and his family were among 600 men, women and children who fled for their lives, along with a small group of C.I.A. officers who had worked with them. They were airlifted to Guam, and then to California, where Dr. Karim was detained and jailed.</p>
        <p>The government's ''primary evidence was a C.I.A. conclusion,'' Mr. Frenzen said. ''The F.B.I. was told by one or more C.I.A. employees in Guam that Dr. Karim's cousin was an Iranian intelligence agent.''</p>
        <p>One F.B.I. agent, John Peterson, testified that he could not say whether the assertion, if true, had any significance for Dr. Karim. ''It may have nothing to do with him, it may have a great deal to do with him,'' he testified.</p>
        <p>After the government agreed to declassify its evidence, it offered to resettle Dr. Karim and five other Iraqis jailed as potential national-security risks in a third country -- not the United States or Iraq.</p>
        <p>While awaiting a resolution, the five have chosen to live with their families in Lincoln, Neb., rather than spend years in prison fighting the case. Dr. Karim chose to fight the government's case to clear his name.</p>
