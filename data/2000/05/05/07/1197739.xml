        <p>Speaking of religion and politics, here is the take of the Rev. Donald L. Roberts of Sarasota, Fla., as expressed in his prayer that opened the session of the Florida Senate on Thursday:</p>
        <p>''It must be great to be God, to get what you want, when you want it, how you want it. We mere mortals are not that lucky. We are always having to compromise to get what we want. We call the process politics. Thank you, Lord. The session is almost over, the budget deal is cut, education got some more money, we cut a few taxes and, in the end, most everyone in this chamber didn't get everything they wanted. And that is good news. That's politics, Lord, and unless you want to move over and give up the job of being God, which some of us think is our birthright, we will have to muddle along being satisfied with being the politicians you can create. It's the fun part of being human. In the name of the God of all things, even politics and politicians and, in rare instances, a lobbyist or two, amen.''</p>
