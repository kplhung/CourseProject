        <p>After putting its stamp on Times Square with an eight-story digital billboard, Nasdaq has now asked the city to put the stock market's name on the southeast corner of 43rd Street and Broadway.</p>
        <p>Nasdaq executives sent letters to officials about the idea.  Councilwoman Christine C. Quinn's letter said: ''When people around the world think of Nasdaq, they will be visualizing the new Times Square. As part of our efforts, we would thus like to propose renaming our corner of 43rd Street, Nasdaq Plaza, to better represent this new and distinctive landmark area.'' The company declined later requests for comment.</p>
        <p>Ms. Quinn, who represents the area, responded swiftly: ''I don't think the purpose of renaming streets is to help support big businesses.''</p>
        <p>Kent Barwick, president of the Municipal Art Society, said:  ''There is a line between public and private environments. The streets and sidewalks belong to the people of New York.''</p>
        <p>But Brendan Sexton, president of the Times Square Business Improvement District, said the proposal suits the new Times Square, which aspires to be a communications hub. ''It's great if they want to celebrate their location,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Taub Urban Research Center at New York University, said precedents exist. ''We have always been responsive to private investors in the renaming of streets,'' he said. ''Longacre Square was renamed Times Square because The New York Times put a building there.'' Four years ago, West 43rd Street between Broadway and Eighth Avenue got a second name, Adolph S. Ochs Street, after The Times's publisher, who bought the paper in 1896.</p>
        <p>Other places renamed for corporations include American Express Plaza and Chase Manhattan Plaza downtown.</p>
        <p>Ira Pers, counsel to the Council's Parks Committee, which oversees street renaming, said the Council's approval is needed for such a proposal. ''We will not introduce legislation until the community supports it,'' he said, usually through a Council member or community board.</p>
        <p>But the mayor routinely renames streets temporarily, Mr. Pers said. A corner of 44th Street and Broadway was temporarily renamed ''Good Morning America Way'' when the ABC News program relocated there last fall.</p>
        <p>Community Board 5 plans a vote Thursday on the renaming, said Lola Finkelstein, the chairwoman. She said she did not expect the board to support the renaming.</p>
        <p>''I would be surprised,'' she said, ''but it could happen.''</p>
