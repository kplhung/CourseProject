        <p>THE danger these days in staging ''Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris'' is not that the songs in this 32-year-old musical revue have become dated.

        <p>THE danger these days in staging ''Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and Living in Paris'' is not that the songs in this 32-year-old musical revue have become dated. They are, for the most part, as sublime and appealing as they were when the Belgian-born songwriter created them. No, the danger in resurrecting ''Brel,'' as Luna Stage has done for its season-ending production, is that today it is twice as hard to find four performers who are up to the challenge.</p>
        <p>Back in the late 1960's, when the show was a sensation at the Village Gate in Greenwich Village, a weak performer or an off night might have been overcome by the sheer audacity of the production -- no plot, virtually no dialogue or props; just two male and two female singer/actors, left to draw character and cohesion out of Brel's wonderful melodies. Today, though, the novelty of the format has worn off, and there is no room for weakness in the cast.</p>
        <p>At Luna Stage, unfortunately, only two of the players are able to rise to the occasion. Kirk Mouser dominates the evening with powerful, expressive readings of some of Brel's most evocative works -- ''Jackie,'' the jaunty song of regret; ''Amsterdam,'' the backhanded ode to a drunken sailor; ''Next,'' the angry recollection of a visit to a mobile military whorehouse. And Miki Yamashita has the kind of beautiful voice and effortless delivery that a revue of this nature demands.</p>
        <p>Ms. Yamashita, though, is badly underused here, a wasted opportunity. Most of the work goes to the other female cast member, Karen Vesper, whose voice slides awkwardly between something operatic and something conversational, frequently sliding off key in the bargain. This costs the show what should be some of its most powerful moments -- the lovely ''Marieke,'' the haunting ''Old Folks.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Vesper is also unable to find any characters within the lyrics; Steven Bloom, the director, and Daniel Lawson, the costume designer, seems to have tried to compensate by wrapping her in assorted costumes that look as if they came out of a child's dress-up box. The fourth cast member, Martin Bedard, does a serviceable job, but he, too, doesn't quite find all the life there is to find in the material. And when the four performers are called upon to sing together, their voices rarely blend seamlessly; only in ''Carousel,'' near the end of the show, does the group sound like a unit.</p>
        <p>This is all too bad, because the Luna's tiny theater is made for ''Jacques Brel.'' The audience is just a few feet from the performers; the opportunity to make a direct connection is there. The three-piece orchestra, too, is close at hand. That should help generate intimacy, the kind musicians achieve in a small jazz club, but this group, under Andrew H. Austin's direction, sounds tinny, and the reed playing is often distractingly shrill.</p>
        <p>Luna bills its ''Jacques Brel'' as ''reconceived for the new millennium,'' which turns out to mean that a few songs have been given present-day reference points that Brel, who died in 1978, could never have envisioned. The subtle addition of AIDS ribbons gives a whole new meaning to the song ''Last Supper,'' for instance, and ''I Loved'' becomes a very funny invocation of a certain recent political scandal.</p>
        <p>These touches, and just being able to hear the songs from this seldom-seen show again, may be worth the trip. It's just unfortunate that Luna's reconceiving of ''Brel'' didn't include simply cutting the cast in half, because at the end of the evening one is left wishing there had been a few more highlights like those provided by Ms. Yamashita and Mr. Mouser.</p>
