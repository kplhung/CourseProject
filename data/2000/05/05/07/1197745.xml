        <p>Fusaichi Pegasus, the $4 million colt named for the flying horse of mythology, came flying through the homestretch at Churchill Downs today to win the 126th Kentucky Derby by a length and a half over Aptitude and give further evidence that racing has a brilliant new star.</p>
        <p>The bay son of Mr. Prospector not only became the first favorite to win the Derby since Spectacular Bid did it 21 years ago, but he also did it with style, finesse and power. And he behaved professionally, avoiding the balkiness that had threatened his career both in races and workouts.</p>
        <p>His jockey, Kent Desormeaux, left his whip at his side and let the horse render one more virtuoso performance. And Fusaichi Pegasus glowed through this one, moving relentlessly from 15th place in the pack of 19 on the first turn until he bolted into the lead as they turned for home. He shifted inside to save ground, then shot to the outside to get into the clear, while 153,204 spectators at Churchill Downs, the second-largest crowd in Derby history, roared in wonder.</p>
        <p>''When the rail opened,'' said his English trainer, Neil Drysdale, ''he took flight. Then he had to wait for his chance to go outside, and he did. He's a very talented horse.''</p>
        <p>Drysdale, who missed his one previous chance to win the Derby in 1992 when the second favorite, A. P. Indy, was scratched with a bruised foot on the morning of the race, completed a week of high success.</p>
        <p>He was elected to racing's Hall of Fame on Tuesday, and won America's most prestigious race four days later, following the exact path taken last year by the trainer D. Wayne Lukas.</p>
        <p>The man who paid the $4 million to buy the horse as a yearling, Fusao Sekiguchi, a 65-year-old venture capitalist from Tokyo, said through an interpreter, ''When I laid eyes on this colt, I knew he was going to be a Derby winner.''</p>
        <p>Then, looking ahead to the Preakness in two weeks and the Belmont Stakes three weeks later, he said, ''As an owner, yes, I would like to challenge for the Triple Crown.''</p>
        <p>Desormeaux, who won the Derby two years ago aboard Real Quiet, gave an emotional tribute to ''a brilliant horse,'' and said with enthusiasm: ''When Mr. Sekiguchi put his money on him, he was just a pretty horse. But this pretty horse can run.'' Then, with poetic flair, the jockey added: ''He floated around there, and we became one.''</p>
        <p>Fusaichi Pegasus ran the mile and a quarter in 2:01 for the sixth-fastest time in Derby history, and he had to turn on the heat against a cast of exceptional rivals. Aptitude, who ran third behind Fusaichi Pegasus in the Wood Memorial in New York three weeks ago, finished strongly for second place, four lengths in front of Impeachment, with More Than Ready fourth. Drysdale's other entry, War Chant, never threatened and finished ninth.</p>
        <p>The winner, who has now won five of six races, crushed the dreams of a full cast of dreamers who made the Derby a storybook scenario.</p>
        <p>Jenine Sahadi failed to become the first female trainer to win the Derby when The Deputy, winner of the Santa Anita Derby, never fired and finished 14th.</p>
        <p>''He did his best,'' she said. ''He didn't have any real trouble. He just didn't fire.''</p>
        <p>Todd Pletcher, entering his first Derby with four horses, saw them finish third (Impeachment), fourth (More Than Ready), 11th (Trippi) and dead last (Graeme Hall). But the 32-year-old onetime assistant to Lukas remained positive, saying:</p>
        <p>''We showed we belonged here. When More Than Ready cut the corner into the stretch, my heart started pumping. The distance may have been just a little far for More Than Ready. Not as much as everyone said, but a little far. Impeachment is a late bloomer. He was beginning to show interest in the stretch. He bulled his way down the rail and closed a ton of ground. All in all, it was a pretty good day.''</p>
        <p>But it was a day of mixed emotions for the sentimental star of this year's class of 3-year-olds, Hal's Hope, the winner of the Florida Derby, and his 88-year-old breeder, owner and trainer, Harold Rose. The rags-to-riches colt led the field with his front-running speed for half a mile in 454/5  seconds, three-quarters in 1:094/5  and one mile in 1:353/5 . But then he tired and dropped back, fading to 16th place and puncturing his owner's hope.</p>
        <p>''When I saw the fractions, I got nervous,'' Rose said. ''You just can't go that fast. I did think he would run a little better, but he just went too fast too early. I guess we go back home with him. I don't know what's next right now.''</p>
        <p>Then there was Wheelaway, who sprang into prominence when he won the Tampa Bay Derby in March and finished third behind High Yield in the Blue Grass. He made a run from eighth after half a mile, then gradually moved to sixth after three-quarters of a mile, fifth after one mile and third entering the stretch. But he was overrun by the closers, and finished fifth.</p>
        <p>''I just collared Captain Steve and thought at the three-sixteenths pole that I'm the winner of the Kentucky Derby,'' the jockey Richard Migliore said. ''I hit him to ask for a little more, and he went inside and slowed me up. But it was the biggest rush I ever had.''</p>
        <p>Another story line centered on two colts from the Middle Eastern emirate of Dubai: China Visit, who finished sixth, and Curule, who ran seventh. They were regarded with some suspicion by many racing analysts because they had only six races between them, all but one of them in Dubai, where the Maktoum family expressed determination to extend its racing empire. They didn't, but both horses ran strong races and perhaps moved Sheik Mohammed al-Maktoum and his brothers closer to their goals.</p>
        <p>The trainer Bobby Frankel, gratified that Aptitude ran second to the favorite after running third in the Wood, said: ''He ran great, but he just got outrun. We're going to the Belmont, but we're not going to the Preakness.''</p>
        <p>Lukas, who has entered 38 horses in the Derby in 20 years and won with four of them, watched with dismay while his three starters struck out: Exchange Rate ran 12th, High Yield 15th and Commendable 17th. And High Yield had run in the money in 11 of his 12 starts.</p>
        <p>''They ran flat for whatever reason,'' he said. ''You know, there is always an explanation of some kind. We've been there before. I was disappointed in all three of them because all trained so well for the race. But you know, it's a horse race, and sometimes it's unexplainable.''</p>
        <p>But to Desormeaux, the Kentucky Derby was very explainable.</p>
        <p>''Once we straightened away and I got him in the clear,'' the winning jockey said, ''I kissed at him and asked him to run, and he accelerated. And it was over at that point. He took off like the best horse I've been involved with at this stage of the game.''</p>
        <p>FINISH LINES</p>
        <p>Saturday's telecast of the Kentucky Derby marked the end of a long run for ABC, which had been the Triple Crown network for many years. Next year the Derby will move to NBC as part of a five-year Triple Crown package. Race officials hope the switch will provide more promotion and exposure for the Derby, which has had declining ratings. The Derby, however, falls in the middle of the National Basketball Association playoffs, which NBC also televises. Churchill Downs officials realize their telecast may be sandwiched between N.B.A. games -- for better or worse. . . . A former president and a presidential candidate were Derby guests of WILLIAM FARISH, the Churchill Downs president. Former President GEORGE BUSH and his son Gov. GEORGE W. BUSH of Texas joined Farish, a friend of the Bushes. The former president had been to the Derby before; his son made his first visit.</p>
