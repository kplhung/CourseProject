        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>If the letter to the editor on March 12 by a ''lawyer specializing in real estate law'' [''Tenant Harassment and Rent Regulation''] was not self-serving, it certainly is naive. I suppose that he would find a minimum-wage law to be ''unrealistic and unfair,'' not to mention any other social intervention in the free-market system.</p>

        <p>If the writer were unable to pay market rents (assuming no rent regulation, his services might not be needed and his wages might decline) would he want to move out of the city, as many now are forced to do because of the weakening of the rent-regulation law?</p>
