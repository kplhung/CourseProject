        <p>IRRATIONAL EXUBERANCE</p>
        <p>By Robert J. Shiller.</p>
        <p>296 pp. Princeton, N.J.:</p>
        <p>Princeton University Press. $27.95.</p>
        <p>We should know better. The greatest stock market boom in history takes place despite all that we have learned about the herd psychology that whips us into buying stocks with such enthusiasm. Never before have so many Americans been so well informed about the propensity of market bubbles to burst, evaporating their wealth before their eyes. And yet people persist -- even after what happened in April -- gambling that a ''new economy,'' more robust and productive than any in the past, will justify the high level of stock prices. Or is it that people know in their hearts that the market is dangerously high, but, caught up in the national mood, they cannot bring themselves to quit?</p>
        <p>No one has explored the strange behavior of the American investor in the 1990's with more authority, or better timing, than Robert J. Shiller, a Yale University economist who laces economics with big doses of psychology in his new book, ''Irrational Exuberance.'' That is a departure in his profession. Most economists assume that people are rational and fully informed, and that their stock investments reflect a realistic assessment of the economy. The roller-coaster, less than rational price swings in April undercut that assumption, and so does Shiller.</p>
        <p>A chart on Page 8 haunts a reader. It is a single, nervous line, like the tracing on a seismograph, that records the price-earnings ratio for a representative group of stocks back to 1881. The line represents share prices in relation to profits for a number of companies. The ratio goes up when stock prices rise faster than profits. There are peaks in 1901, 1929 and 1966, the high points of the previous booms. These are followed by long, often precipitous declines, each lasting a decade or more before the line finally climbs up toward the next boom. The latest upturn began in the early 1980's and took off in the 90's. The line is still climbing, almost vertically -- already far above the three previous peaks. Research in economics, psychology, demography, sociology and history, Shiller writes, suggests that ''the present stock market displays the classic features of a speculative bubble: a situation in which temporarily high prices are sustained largely by investors' enthusiasm rather than by consistent estimation of real value.''</p>
        <p>What set off this speculation and what feeds it? Shiller ranges widely in his explanations, laying them out in the first 168 pages in easy-to-read, sometimes passionate prose. The last three chapters bog down in a discussion of the proper value of stocks -- only an economist could love it -- and in Shiller's solutions, which have to be taken on faith. (He would draw steam out of the stock market by creating new markets in other items.) But those first 168 pages are must reading for anyone with savings invested in stocks. Just internalizing Shiller's explanations of why we speculate is probably the best antidote of all.</p>
        <p>He notes that profits have indeed been strong in the 90's and that growth has coincided with the blossoming of Internet technology, creating the impression that the two are linked. Triumphalism also plays a role. The collapse of the Soviet Union and the greater prosperity in America than in Europe and Japan reinforce confidence in American capitalism, and in the stock market.</p>
        <p>Cultural changes are important, particularly the growing public reverence for wealthy business people, the promotion of gambling (which ''suppresses natural inhibitions against taking risks'') and the erosion among workers of loyalty to their employers. ''By pursuing speculative investments,'' Shiller says, ''people in effect create for themselves a second job -- one where they are, at last, their own boss.''</p>
        <p>Wall Street analysts encourage speculation. The most optimistic are also the most successful, and recommendations to sell become rare. The growth of mutual funds and the spread of self-financed pension plans keep people focused on stocks. So does the endless stream of financial news on all-day television programs. ''Such enhanced business reporting,'' Shiller writes, ''leads to increased demand for stocks, just as advertisements for a consumer product make people more familiar with the product, remind them of the option to buy and ultimately motivate them to buy.''</p>
        <p>The list goes on. Low inflation raises confidence in the stock market, an ''illusion'' that leaves out the role of interest rates in determining the real value of stocks. But Shiller, whose findings are based in part on his own surveys of investors, is at his best in describing the group pressures and herd behavior that sustain investment -- the amplification mechanism,'' as he calls it. People are prodded into the market, for example, by the constant suggestion of ''the moral superiority of those who invested well'' and the ego-diminishing envy stirred by hearing that others have earned more in the market than they have in salary. ''The emotional state of investors when they decide on their investments is no doubt one of the most important factors causing the bull market,'' Shiller asserts.</p>
        <p>THE Ponzi effect heads his list. As stock prices rise, people talk endlessly of their windfalls and new investors are drawn in. Each new injection of money pushes up stock prices, creating more happy campers whose stories draw in more investors. Overconfidence fuels the process, which Shiller calls a ''naturally occurring Ponzi scheme.'' It unwinds when something scares the investors, and then the feedback effect works in reverse: negative stories pull down the market.</p>
        <p>Like other writers before him -- most recently Edward Chancellor, in his very anecdotal ''Devil Take the Hindmost: A History of Financial Speculation'' (1999) -- Shiller notes that the behavior of today is a replica of that in previous booms, even including the popular notion that a price drop is a buying opportunity, a rationalization also touted in 1929.</p>
        <p>Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, coined the phrase that became the title of Shiller's book. Greenspan has since backed away, suggesting that the rising market may reflect rational investments in an ever more productive and profitable corporate America. But how can investors be thought of as rational and dispassionate when they so often ignore the social and psychological forces shaping their behavior?</p>
