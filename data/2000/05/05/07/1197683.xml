        <p>At first the veterinarian said that it might just be milk fever. Then the possibility of a brain tumor was discussed. But as the laboratory took longer and longer to report test results, Guy Jambon accepted the inevitable. One of his herd had been infected with mad cow disease, although no cases had ever been detected in this southeast region of France.</p>
        <p>The health department trucks came a few days later, on Feb. 18. In one morning, all 670 of Mr. Jambon's cows were taken for slaughter and incineration -- leaving the barns, the pens, the milking room and the fields empty.</p>
        <p>''The part that got to you was how quiet it was,'' Mr. Jambon said. ''I was saying to myself: 'We don't really understand anything. How did the cow get this disease? How did this happen here?' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Jambon is not alone in raising such questions. The number of cases of mad cow disease discovered in France, as in many other countries in Europe, has been climbing steadily. The totals are still minuscule compared with those in the United Kingdom, which has reported 178,000 cases of the deadly degenerative brain disease since 1986 and endured a four-year ban on its beef by other European nations.</p>
        <p>But what many experts find alarming is that the numbers are going up at all, given that strict preventive measures were ordered in 1996, when scientists first linked mad cow disease, also known as bovine spongiform encephalopathy, to a similar brain disease in humans.</p>
        <p>Not only are totals rising, but more and more countries have reported cases of the disease. It has now been discovered in native-born cows in 10 European countries, including Portugal, Switzerland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg and Denmark.</p>
        <p>In France, the issue has been all over the front pages lately as the pace of cases appears to be rising steeply this year. In 1997, six cases were detected in France. In 1998, 18. Last year, it was 30. This year, 16 new cases have been reported already, roughly one a week.</p>
        <p>Officials are so worried that they intend to begin random testing of cows that have died after exhibiting suspicious behavior before the start of summer. As many as 50,000 of France's 21 million cattle are expected to be examined each year under the program.</p>
        <p>Martin Hirsch, the head of France's new food safety agency, is, like many other officials here, bracing himself for the results.</p>
        <p>''It could certainly show that there is much more mad cow out there than we have detected so far,'' Mr. Hirsch said. ''We just don't know. There is so much we don't know about this disease, we can hardly say with confidence that it is under control. We'll have to see.''</p>
        <p>But French officials are not the only ones concerned. Earlier this year, a group of scientists advising the European Union on the issue warned that millions of Europeans may be at risk of catching Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, the fatal human version of mad cow disease, despite their governments' claims that their countries are free of the disease. The European Union has been urging broader preventive measures throughout its 15 member countries. But some countries have refused, saying they do not have a problem.</p>
        <p>''We would like to see these measures taken,'' said Beate Gminder, a spokeswoman for David Byrne, the food safety commissioner for the European Commission, the executive body of the European Union. ''The number of cases of mad cow may be much larger than we know. It could be that cases exist much more extensively.''</p>
        <p>Scientists are still highly puzzled by the disease, which was first recognized in cows in 1986. It appears that it is not caused by a bacteria, a virus or a fungus, but stems from infectious particles called prions, perhaps acting in concert with a virus or other agent. The disease kills brain cells, leaving the organ full of holes and resembling a sponge.</p>
        <p>Since the human form of the disease was first recognized in 1995, more than 35 people have died of it in Britain. Estimates of how many people are likely to be infected range widely. Some British scientists have speculated that 75 more people will die of the disease in the next 20 years. Others say 80,000, depending on the incubation period and how the infection is passed from animal to human.</p>
        <p>No one yet knows how much infected meat someone must eat before the lethal brain-wasting disease takes hold, or if some other factor must be present, too. To date, efforts to prevent the disease in cows have centered on eliminating animal feed that contains infected animal parts.</p>
        <p>But some experts believe that, apart from foodstuffs and cow-to-calf transmission, there may be a third, and yet unknown, mode of transmission.</p>
        <p>''This disease is one of the great mysteries of the century,'' Mr. Hirsch said. ''We don't know exactly what is the nature of this disease, so we don't know what steps to take to prevent it. We do have many questions about modes of transmission. We are looking at different things.''</p>
        <p>So far, France has taken perhaps the most conservative position in Europe, refusing to even accept British beef despite assurances by European Union officials that it is as safe as any other beef on the market. (The European Union is currently moving forward with a lawsuit against France over the matter.)</p>
        <p>But while the European Union may feel France has gone too far in trying to protect itself from British meat, it is urging many European countries to take more precautions against mad cow disease than they have been willing to take so far.</p>
        <p>Only seven European Union countries, including Britain and France, have taken the strictest preventive measures. Not only do they control the animal feed, but they also prevent the parts of the cattle most likely to carry prions, including the brain, spinal material and intestines, from even entering the food chain.</p>
        <p>The European Commission would like Austria, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Greece, Sweden, Italy and Spain to do the same. (Italy and Spain currently ban only the most infective parts of the beef from countries with known cases of the disease.)</p>
        <p>The European Union is also planning a monitoring program starting in 2001 that would test up to 65,000 cows a year throughout its member nations to build a realistic picture of a disease that many fear is underreported.</p>
        <p>While Britain has been hit hardest by the disease, Ireland is next with 466 cases. Portugal has had 371 and Switzerland 351. The next highest country is France, with 92 cases detected since 1991. Most of France's cases have been in the north, where there is a greater likelihood of exchanges of feed and cattle with Britain. But lately, cases have begun to be detected in other regions of France.</p>
        <p>French officials had predicted that because of their precautions cases of the disease would be declining by now. Experts note that it no doubt took a while for the 1996 regulations banning animal parts from animal feed to take hold. And there may also be instances in which regulations were ignored and the effects are now being seen. A recent European Union report still found traces of meat and bone meal in some samples of French feed despite the ban. But some experts say they are not sure such incidents account for the rise in numbers.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Britain's Conservative Party has called for a European ban on French beef. But the appeal has largely been dismissed as a political tit-for-tat, as the numbers of infected cattle are still very small. In addition to France, the United States continues to ban British beef. But it does not have similar restrictions on beef from elsewhere in Europe, Ms. Gminder said.</p>
        <p>So far, French farmers unions and the government have stepped in quickly to help farmers whose herds have been hit by the disease. Within a week of losing his cows, Mr. Jambon had 30 young calves back on his farm.</p>
        <p>''It was at least something to keep him busy,'' said Gilbert Limandas, the president of the local farmers union. ''There is no question that this is a real trauma for the farmers.''</p>
        <p>But as he goes about his work, Mr. Jambon says, he is still scared it will happen again.</p>
        <p>''There are no precautions to take because I had already taken all the precautions I knew about,'' he said. 'So, I'm back doing the same thing and hoping it doesn't happen again. We are all wondering around here: 'Who will it hit next?' ''</p>
