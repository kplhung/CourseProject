        <p>The County Health Department is taking several steps to deal with the possible return of West Nile encephalitis, a virus that is spread by mosquitoes and killed seven New Yorkers last year, including a woman from New Rochelle. The department is asking residents to call the West Nile Virus Hotline (637-4926) to report dead birds, and it is dropping a larvicide, which prevents mosquito larvae from becoming adults, into 50,000 catch basins. The county is also urging residents to help reduce the mosquito population by removing unnecessary water containers, by covering trash containers to keep out rain and by turning over plastic wading pools and wheelbarrows when not in use. Also, homeowners should make sure that window screens fit tightly and are in good repair.</p>
