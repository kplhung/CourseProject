        <p>GRIM'' was one guest's reaction to the decor of the new Tandoori Taste of India in New Canaan.</p>
        <p>''Weird,'' said another.</p>
        <p>''I like it,'' declared a third. ''It's cool, very New York, like Vong.''</p>
        <p>Clearly, its in-your-face look has created more buzz than the food at this new sibling of the more traditional Tandoori restaurants in Darien and Stamford. The new Tandoori makes a statement of with-it, post-industrial modernity, steering clear of any specific Indian identity; it even offers Malaysian dishes.</p>
        <p>The restaurant is also surprisingly devoid of many familiar Indian choices. But if you ignore the decor,  you will be able to enjoy some intriguing, not cliched dishes.</p>
        <p>Several of the best were innovative, like kori, nuggets of white-meat chicken with chopped vegetables (eggplant, scallions and asparagus) in a spicy black-bean sauce. On the nightly specials menu were two other winsome selections: kekda (soft-shell crab in an assertive sweet-sour-hot sauce, mixed with onions, tomatoes and a hint of lemongrass, served over idiappan rice noodles), and malai kofta (pyramids of chopped vegetables in a creamy ground almond sauce). Tiyung belachan consisted of grilled eggplant in a minimal but well-seasoned sauce.</p>
        <p>There were a few old favorites. Lamb vindaloo, tender chunks with potatoes in an incendiary sauce, was just as it should be. Shrimp balchao, a Goan specialty, blended curry leaves, tomato, scallions, garlic and spices with minced vegetables and jumbo shrimp in a highly satisfying entree. At lunch we enjoyed the shrimp chili masala, tails-on shrimp with red pepper, onions, tomatoes and green chilies -- tangy indeed.</p>
        <p>Tuna passion, sushi-grade chopped fresh tuna tartare, was enlivened by slivers of fresh mango. We also savored a satay starter: deeply seasoned shrimp, served with a tingling red-pepper peanut sauce.</p>
        <p>We liked tofu do piaz (diced and stir-fried with tomatoes, onions, shiitake slivers and fresh cilantro), served as an entree. Tofu chutney pakoras, less appealing, consisted of lightly battered tempura tofu, served with an unexceptional tamarind dip, not ''filled with mint chutney'' as the menu stated. Tamarind seems to be the ubiquitous Tandoori dip.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, various dishes were served without their dipping sauces. Lasuni gobi, little fireballs of cauliflower, would have had an extra dimension if their soy-garlic sauce had not been overlooked. Jhinga Manchurian, spiced shrimp, was good but dry, desperately seeking the omitted soy-ginger sauce.</p>
        <p>There were other missteps. Vegetable samosas had crisp shells, but the potato-pea filling was wizened. Two fish dishes, patra ni macchi and Malacca, sounded tempting, but their coconut sauces were thin and characterless. Most of the unleavened tandoori breads were disappointing, and the stuffed nans (onion kulcha, garlic nan and khandari nan) had scant filling.</p>
        <p>Dips and chutneys other than tamarind are available, as is the refreshing raita, but are not listed on the menu. We asked three times one evening, but the raita and the mango and mint chutneys never appeared.</p>
        <p>One may not expect much from desserts at an Indian restaurant, but Tandoori surprised us with a delicious mango cheesecake in a mango coulis and a chocolate devastation called Dark Side of the Moon.</p>
        <p>Dinner for two, three courses apiece, came to $54, before tax, gratuity or drinks. There is a modest wine list, very well priced. A beer list offers some excellent choices.</p>
        <p>Tandoori certainly has potential, as evidenced by our successful dishes. But the oversize menu is difficult to handle, and outsize serving plates make sharing almost impossible on the relatively small tables.</p>
        <p>Then there is the service, which can be even more disturbing than the deafening noise. Dishes, as we mentioned, came incomplete; requests for water refills were ignored; and side orders never arrived. Once our entrees were delivered, our waiter usually disappeared. A floor manager is obviously needed.</p>
        <p>Tandoori Taste of India  87 Main Street, New Canaan. (203) 972-8332.</p>
        <p>Satisfactory</p>
        <p>ATMOSPHERE -- Dark browns and factory fittings, with an overhead water chute emptying into a waterfall.  NOISE LEVEL -- Excruciatingly high.  SERVICE -- Lackadaisical, almost chaotic on weekends.  RECOMMENDED DISHES -- Tuna passion, Jhinga Manchurian, satay, vindaloo, kori, shrimp balchao, tiyung balachan, kekda, tofu do piaz, shrimp chili masala, okra do piaz, mango cheesecake, Dark Side of the Moon.  PRICE RANGE -- Lunch entrees: $9-$12; dinner entrees: $9-$24.  CREDIT CARDS -- Most accepted.  HOURS -- Lunch: 11:30 a.m.-3 p.m. daily; dinner: 5-10 Sunday-Thursday, 5-11 Friday and Saturday.  RESERVATIONS -- Until 6:30 p.m.  WHEELCHAIR ACCESSIBILITY -- Nine short steps to the dining room; restrooms at same level.</p>
