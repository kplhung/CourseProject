        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Laugh-a-Minute Oval Office'' (Op-Ed, May 4): Susan Silver's feeling that Bill Clinton's comedy video for the Washington correspondents' dinner ''might have been the final straw in the unfortunate blurring of show business and politics'' is overstated.</p>
        <p>Her dream of a politics that rewards ''the experienced, intelligent, hard-working'' but bland politician is noble but chimerical. Politics is a reflection of culture, and American culture has always treated even its solemn exercises in civic participation as opportunities for diversion.</p>

        <p>History also instructs us that presidents who leavened their responsibilities with humor often produced records of accomplishment and portraits of psychological health that future presidents would be wise to seek to emulate.</p>
