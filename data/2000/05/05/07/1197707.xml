        <p>It was summertime in the late 80's, and a hulking 7-foot figure with strides as long as normal leaps could be spotted moving through the halls of the Georgetown University gymnasium, outfitted with an infant son on his hip and a diaper bag over his shoulder.</p>
        <p>A few moments later -- after greeting everyone along his path and wiping any spittle off his sleeve -- he would leave his son in the safe hands of a Hoya staff member and take the court.</p>
        <p>It was time for Patrick Ewing to go to work.</p>
        <p>It was the National Basketball Association's off-season, but Ewing never believed his selection as the No. 1 pick in the 1985 draft meant he was a finished product. The young Knick savior did not need a long vacation. He wanted to improve; and still does. So each summer for the last 14 years -- as his children have grown and his injuries have multiplied -- Ewing has gone back to school.</p>
        <p>''I remember when he'd come in with his son, little Patrick, and he'd change his diapers, and everything,'' said the former Georgetown coach, John Thompson, currently an N.B.A. analyst for TBS. ''He'd leave him with the trainer and then get in his workout. Patrick was an example to everyone, all the players who watched him. It was like, this is how you do it; this is how you work; this is how you achieve.''</p>
        <p>Each summer Ewing flung open the gym doors, and it was as if he was a hero parting streamers and confetti to all the young Hoyas waiting for their first sturdy whisker. They revered Ewing, especially Alonzo Mourning.</p>
        <p>Mourning was the kid who wasn't moved by basketball until he was 12 years old. Then, one night, he has said, he found himself sitting in front of a television, transfixed by the determination Ewing showed during the Hoyas' run to the 1982 National Collegiate Athletic Association final against North Carolina. The next day, Mourning took the money he made from mowing lawns in Chesapeake, Va., and bought a Georgetown jersey. A couple of years later, he requested Ewing's number in high school.</p>
        <p>Today, as the introductions before Game 1 of the Knicks' four-of-seven-game second-round series against the Heat rise above the noise at American Airlines Arena in Miami, the longtime friends will emerge with No. 33 on their chests. As the series between these rival teams unfolds, a theory will be put to the test: Is Mourning still in awe of Ewing? Does facing his mentor unnerve Mourning?</p>
        <p>''If you were to say to Alonzo, 'Patrick is your big brother, and Patrick is your mentor, and Patrick is the guy who watches over you,' the connotation is that this is somewhere Patrick can get to him,'' Heat Coach Pat Riley said last Thursday. ''That is what Alonzo has to deal with. They will be lifelong friends. Can that truly be separated in competition? That's why I never ever in my whole career cultivated any kind of relationship with somebody I was going to have to compete against.''</p>
        <p>Maybe that's just Riley. As the witness to more than a decade of intense summer one-on-ones between Mourning and Ewing, when he wondered if blood would drop on the floor before sweat, Thompson never viewed the younger Hoya of the two as a shrinking violet.</p>
        <p>''You should have a mental edge when you have more experience,'' Thompson said. ''And Patrick has had that, and he has that savvy. But now Alonzo has been there, and he has experience. Now, it's just about who has the better game that night.''</p>
        <p>Now, Mourning is a rippling 30-year-old with boulders under his skin. He is the shot-blocking menace who landed on the league's all-defensive team and the proud owner of a nifty jumper, flashy hook and wicked dunk. So what is this nonsense Ewing spouted about Mourning last week? ''He's definitely the best center in the East -- next to me,'' Ewing proclaimed. On Friday, Ewing said he stood by his statement.</p>
        <p>Here's an aging superstar, who, at 37, is one postgame ice bag away from becoming a cryonic experiment and only yesterday skipped the final practice before Game 1 with back spasms, and he's talking trash? In some circles, Ewing's comments were taken at face value. Although Mourning's statistics are far superior this season, Ewing can claim an edge in greatness after his nerve held up steadier in Game 5 of the Knicks' series victory last year in Miami. To others, it seemed as if Ewing was trying to slip a psychological sliver of doubt in Mourning's mind. A sort of mental warfare.</p>
        <p>Maybe it's not nearly this complicated.</p>
        <p>''That's just how they talk to each other,'' Thompson said. ''I've heard them say much worse over dinner. It's like, 'I killed you.' It's that kind of stuff. I laughed with Patrick about that when I talked to him Friday morning. It wasn't something in any way that was demeaning to Alonzo. It's something they say all the time.</p>
        <p>''There were times when I was in my office and heard them out there yelling and hollering on the floor. I used to go out and lean over the rail to see if they were fighting. You'd see them cheating one another, giving each other a hard time, but always going all out.''</p>
        <p>And always together. They have been close for years. During the owners' lockout last season, when Ewing and Mourning were bound together by the criticism they endured as union leaders, they were a constant tandem outside the meeting rooms. One would call home, and the other would playfully yank the phone away and begin chatting with family members.</p>
        <p>''Look, when I can't play anymore, I'm going to watch him and Dikembe play,'' said Ewing, including Atlanta's Dikembe Mutombo in his Georgetown circle of friends. ''After this, when basketball is over, the friendship is always going to be there. That's what life is about. Everyone wants to win, everyone wants to make money. But if you don't have friends and family, what do you have?''</p>
        <p>Ewing has a friend with the same qualities as himself. He and Mourning are fierce competitors, tireless workers and aching for a championship. But in this series, Mourning's performance could go a long way in determining whether Ewing ever grabs the title that has eluded him.</p>
        <p>''He knows I can't guard him one-on-one,'' Mourning conceded. ''If we give him the paint, and I'm behind him, he's going to back you down. But they know he can't guard me one-on-one. They'll double me and run guys at me.''</p>
        <p>And yet, there will be times when it's just the two of them, face to face. It happened last year in Game 5, when Ewing won a stare-down with Mourning. Then, a few hours after Allan Houston's miracle shot eliminated the Heat, Mourning and Ewing were talking again, as if the game could not intrude on their friendship.</p>
        <p>''That will never happen,'' Mourning said. ''We know how to separate the two -- the friendship and the business part of it -- and we've been doing it for years.''</p>
        <p>Over his eight years in the league, Mourning has met Ewing in three playoff series. Twice, Ewing has come out ahead, including last year when he scored 22 points, grabbed 11 rebounds and was unshakable in the final minutes of Game 5. Mourning appeared tentative, as if frozen by the sight of Ewing.</p>
        <p>Maybe Ewing did get to him. That's what Riley seems concerned about.</p>
        <p>But maybe Ewing does not inhibit Mourning at all. Maybe their friendship just brings out the best in both of them, and, on different nights, one comes out ahead of the other.</p>
        <p>''I don't know the reason, but Patrick definitely cares about Alonzo, and that's also why they go at each other so hard,'' Thompson said. ''They wouldn't respect one another if they didn't play with every bit of competitive desire they had.''</p>
