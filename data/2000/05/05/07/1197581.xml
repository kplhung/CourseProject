        <p>GARY E. ANDERSON knows what most people think of when they hear the name Dow Corning: breast implants, and nothing else. And if Mr. Anderson, Dow Corning's chief executive, were an irritable kind of fellow, that would irk him mightily.</p>
        <p>After all, Dow Corning makes 10,000 products for more than 30,000 customers, and it never derived more than 1 percent of its sales from breast implants. These days, operating earnings are growing robustly.</p>
        <p>Yet the impact of implant-related class-action suits has kept Dow Corning operating under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy laws since 1995. And because Dow Corning is owned by the Dow Chemical Company and Corning Inc., not directly by shareholders, and because it sells no consumer products, neither the business press nor securities analysts have paid much attention to the company's recovery.</p>
        <p>But irritability is not Mr. Anderson's style. A soft-spoken, easygoing man who does not wait for Fridays to dress casually, he patiently discusses the implant issue when asked.</p>
        <p>No, Dow did not lose customers, suppliers or employees when the implant debacle hit. Yes, he stands by subsequent studies that absolve silicone from blame in autoimmune and other diseases. Yes, he had hoped that Dow Corning would have emerged from bankruptcy by now, but no, it probably will not for another couple of years.</p>
        <p>Only after answering such questions does Mr. Anderson turn to the subject that really makes his juices flow: Dow Corning's mainstay silicone business.</p>
        <p>''We sell something to every SIC code,'' Mr. Anderson said, referring to a common classification system for industries.</p>
        <p>SMALL wonder. Silicones are remarkably inert materials; they do not conduct electricity, they are resistant to heat and cold, and they don't react with most chemicals. They are thus ideal insulators, protectants and additives.</p>
        <p>Dow Corning routinely pumps about 8 percent of sales into research -- a high percentage for a materials company -- and its roster of patents and products keeps swelling. Its silicones add a soft, nongreasy feel to skin lotions and help shampoos leave behind high-gloss hair. They provide leak-proof seals for automobile engines and coatings for air bags.</p>
        <p>The company just introduced a new line of silicone adhesives and protective sealants that make it possible to reduce the size of computer chips without risk that they will short out. The latest PlayStation from Sony already uses the chips, and Dow Corning executives predict that the semiconductor market, now accounting for about 2 percent of sales, will bring as much as 15 percent of sales and 20 percent of profits by 2004.</p>
        <p>The specter of huge settlements over the breast implant issue keeps Dow Corning in bankruptcy. But as  Siegfried Haberer, a 30-year Dow Corning veteran and now its executive vice president, said, ''I haven't seen major impact from the bankruptcy on our business in the last five years, and I don't think I'll see it in the next five.''</p>
        <p>Dow Corning's fiscal health -- not to mention a study last year that seemed to clear breast implants in health problems -- infuriates its legal antagonists. Sybil Niden Goldrich, co-founder of the Command Trust Network, which distributes silicone implant information, and a self-described ''silicone breast implant survivor,'' has long been critical of the scientific studies of implants. ''It seems unfair that you can  do business as usual under the protection of bankruptcy,'' she said.</p>
        <p>IN one sense, the same factors that have kept Dow Corning's rebound a secret have given it a certain immunity to public anger. Started in 1943 by Dow Chemical and Corning, it has never had to contend with  skittish shareholders. And because its customers are other businesses, its sales have not been affected by any emotional backlash. ''The guy ordering silicone sealants isn't thinking of negative public relations,'' said J. Jeffrey Cianci, an analyst at Warburg Dillon Read.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anderson said customers have rallied round him. ''I got tons of reassuring calls from customers and suppliers,'' he said. ''You could tell they were thinking, 'There but for the grace of God go I.' ''</p>
        <p>There has been no mass flight of employees; in fact, the list has grown with newcomers -- including many women.</p>
        <p>''Of course I'm sympathetic to the women who've gone through this,'' said Denise L. Wiggins, who joined as global marketing communications manager in 1997. ''But during the interviews, I got the sense of a company with high integrity and a solid base of employees. The breast implant situation just wasn't top of mind for me.''</p>
        <p>That ''situation'' has given Dow Corning a rough financial ride, though. Before its bankruptcy filing, the company took nearly $2 billion in pretax charges to reflect its liability under an industrywide settlement agreement. As of Dec. 31, 1999, Dow Corning was named in 25,000 pending lawsuits.</p>
        <p>To make matters worse, the Asian economic meltdown sent Dow Corning's sales and profits into a nosedive in 1998. Its revenues have been stuck at around $2.6 billion for the last three years.</p>
        <p>Still, last year the company was back to $220 million in operating income -- a nice rebound from the $831 million operating loss in 1998. And net income was back to $109.7 million, a lot better than the net loss of $598 million in 1998.</p>
        <p>''If Dow Corning were publicly traded, it would be one of the better-regarded specialty chemical companies on the street,'' said Mark Gulley, an analyst with Banc of America Securities.</p>
        <p>Dow Corning's parents have offered not just sympathy, but empathy. Dow Chemical, after all, went through its own tumult when dioxin, a byproduct of its defoliant Agent Orange, was branded a health hazard.</p>
        <p>''We told them, get some high-level people to focus on the implant issue, and let everyone else focus on the rest of the business,'' said William S. Stavropoulos, chief executive of Dow Chemical. In fact, in 1992 Keith McKennon, a Dow Chemical executive who had coordinated much of Dow's public response to the Agent Orange litigation, joined Dow Corning as interim chief executive. One of the first things he did was to plead the company's case on ''Larry King Live.''</p>
        <p>Both Dow Chemical and Corning emphatically deny persistent rumors that Corning is losing interest in the venture and that Dow will buy its share. ''Dow Corning has focused all of its energies on one field of science, and we're enjoying the fruits of that, so why mess with it?'' Mr. Stavropoulos said.</p>
        <p>Corning, meanwhile, has moved heavily into fiber optics, an area that makes great use of silicone coatings. Thus, Dow Corning's products ''are in high demand in many of the same growth markets Corning is pursuing,'' said Keith Horn, technical director of organic materials in Corning's science and technology group.</p>
        <p>But one high-growth industry is conspicuously absent from Dow Corning's to-do list. The company is soured, perhaps forever, on medical applications, which in 1990 represented 7 percent of sales. Dow Corning sold its line of implants for knees, hips and the like soon after the first breast implant suits, and has scuttled research into synthetic skin, eye fluids and artificial eyes.</p>
        <p>''We could have continued the evolution toward a bionic person, so society has lost out,'' Mr. Anderson said.  ''But until trial lawyers are reined in, and we get better laws, it's just not worth the aggravation of making anything that goes into the body.''</p>
