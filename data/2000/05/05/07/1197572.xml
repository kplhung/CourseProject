        <p>Edna Mamula vividly remembers the first time she entered the Olympia Theater at Broadway and 107th Street. She was 19 and the movie was ''Gone With the Wind.''</p>
        <p>''I went with a fellow I was going with then, another one that I buried,'' said Ms. Mamula, 79. ''It was a big, beautiful theater, very comfortable. Everything was carpeted and luxurious.''</p>
        <p>Luxurious is not the word that best describes the current Olympia. After years of neglect and several renovations, the interior bears little resemblance to that of the grand movie palace of Ms. Mamula's memories. Gone are the box seats, the brocaded wallpaper and the two balconies where Ms. Mamula and her beaux would go to smoke and smooch.</p>
        <p>Today the Olympia is divided into two lesser theaters with poor legroom and awkward sight lines. It is an undistinguished neighborhood movie house nobody is likely to miss until it is gone, and some local residents fear it soon may be.</p>
        <p>For months, stories have circulated locally that Clearview Cinema Group, the owner of the Olympia and the building it occupies, intends to tear down the three-story structure and build something else. Fueling the stories is that one tenant, a pet shop, is already gone. Another, Presto's Restaurant, has received notice that its lease will be terminated at the end of this month. ''A clause in our lease says they can only terminate early if the building is coming down,'' said Charon LoPresto, one of the restaurant's owners.</p>
        <p>Clearview, a subsidiary of Cablevision Systems Corporation, has not announced plans to build on the lot nor filed plans with the city. But in a statement, the chain said it is in discussion with developers ''to explore options to better service the needs of neighborhood theatergoers, including expansion of the current theater into a multiscreen venue.''</p>
        <p>''I just hope one of the options they'll explore is talking to the community,'' said Assemblyman Edward C. Sullivan, who represents the fast-growing area. ''What are they going to put in its place? Is it going to be better?''</p>
        <p>Paula Diamond-Roman, a community advocate, said, ''What we want to avoid is what happened to the Upper West Side in the 1980's,'' when the area developed rapidly. She and others are less concerned by the prospect of a multiplex than by what they fear Clearview will put above it: a high-rise.</p>
        <p>One reason for the worry is that, under a rezoning of the site in 1987, its owner can build higher than the 14 to 16 stories that characterize the Broadway skyline. Ms. Diamond-Roman said a high-rise would cast morning shadows over Strauss Park, directly across Broadway. ''We still have light and space here,'' she said. ''It's part of what makes this such a lovely neighborhood.''</p>
        <p>The Olympia was opened in 1914 during a building boom, when the IRT made northern Manhattan accessible to middle-class commuters. Like many of the movie theaters that once lined Broadway, the Olympia flourished during the next several decades. When the neighborhood declined in the 60's, so did the theater. Then came the renovations of the 1980's.</p>
        <p>Not long ago, a film crew came to this newly booming neighborhood to use the original exterior of the theater as a stand-in for a 1930's vaudeville house. Movie stars graced the streets for a few days.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mamula watched from the sidewalk, comparing the actors to the greats she used to gaze upon inside. ''They aren't as handsome as they used to be, are they?''</p>
