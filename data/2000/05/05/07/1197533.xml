        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I have always regarded ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' as an autobiography, a primary-source historical document and an extraordinary example of young adult literature.</p>
        <p>In the Q&amp;A interview with me [March 5], the editing gave the erroneous impression that I saw the book as historical fiction.</p>
        <p>What is important, however, is that students read about other adolescents engaged and embedded in a historical context. Through this literature, rather than a textbook, students will be able to read about other cultures with greater understanding.</p>
        <p>Young adult literature promotes more meaningful student involvement, increases their interest and motivates them to discover the past and its connection to their lives today. Most importantly, they can visualize themselves going through the experiences represented in a peer's point-of-view. Young adult literature is a valuable tool for helping teenagers to understand themselves and to see their place in the world.</p>
