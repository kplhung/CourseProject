        <p>I am a female internist. A patient with a sexually transmitted disease asked that his wife -- not my patient -- be tested but not told about his extramarital affair. I worried that she might go untreated or be sent to a doctor unaware of her risk. I saw her, and she never asked about the source of her infection. As both patients are now entitled to confidentiality, I am apprehensive of conflicts of interest. Did I do right? /Anonymous</p>
        <p>Your concern for both patients is admirable, but allowing the husband to limit your actions placed you in the wrong. The A.M.A.'s code of ethics demands that a doctor have her patient's informed consent in order to perform any treatment. This required you to tell her what you were treating her for and why, thus violating your pledge to the husband. Also, by not telling her the source of her infection, you deprived her of a chance to protect herself in the future.</p>

        <p>I am a female internist. A patient with a sexually transmitted disease asked that his wife -- not my patient -- be tested but not told about his extramarital affair.

        <p>Your concern for both patients is admirable, but allowing the husband to limit your actions placed you in the wrong. The A.M.A.'s code of ethics demands that a doctor have her patient's informed consent in order to perform any treatment. This required you to tell her what you were treating her for and why, thus violating your pledge to the husband. Also, by not telling her the source of her infection, you deprived her of a chance to protect herself in the future.</p>
        <p>The best solution is to avoid being in this position in the first place. Ethical behavior is meant as much to avert such situations as it is to extricate you from them. Ideally, you should have interrupted the husband as he made his request, saying that if his wife is worried about her health, you'd be happy to examine her.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding the wife's odd passivity, one thing you can do now is build a relationship of trust with her so that she is more able to participate in her own care. You could also refer her to a gynecologist who would be unfettered by any promise to the husband.</p>
        <p>Despite your honorable intentions, it is difficult to see what the wife got from you that she wouldn't have received from a less scrupulous doctor selected by the husband. Further, it seems unlikely that, had you declined his terms, his wife would have gone without care. Surely the husband would be anxious to have her treated, if only to protect himself from becoming reinfected. One lesson I draw from this: husbands and wives should have their own doctors. This, of course, contradicts one of the premises upon which family medicine is built, but it does avoid such painful conflicts of interest.</p>
