        <p>Here are some of the legendary movie theaters that have come and gone along Broadway north of Columbus Circle.</p>
        <p>MICHAEL PORTER</p>
        <p>Riviera-Riverside Theater (96th Street) This immense complex of four theaters, opened between 1911 and 1914, could accommodate 6,600 moviegoers. Despite efforts by neighbors to save them, the theaters were razed in 1976 to make way for an apartment tower.</p>
        <p>Thalia (95th Street) This tiny haven for film buffs opened in 1931 and closed in 1987. It was notable for aisles that sloped toward the screen and for its appearance in the Woody Allen film ''Annie Hall.'' It reopened in July 1993, but closed for good in August 1994 and was gutted last April.</p>
        <p>New Yorker Theater (88th Street) Formerly the Adelphi Theater, built in 1912, the New Yorker drew loyal patrons with foreign and avant-garde films. It was sold in 1973 to the Walter Reade chain and was demolished in 1985 to make way for an apartment building.</p>
        <p>Keith's 81st Street Theater Opened in 1913 as a vaudeville and movie house with 2015 seats, the theater was sold to CBS in 1954 and turned into a television studio. It was demolished in 1986, but its facade was preserved as the base of a new tower.</p>
        <p>Beacon Theater (74th Street) Now a busy concert venue, the Beacon (detail at left) started out in 1929 as a movie palace, seating 2,708. Its interior was declared a landmark in 1979.</p>
        <p>Embassy 72nd Street Twin Theater  Beloved for its foreign, offbeat and provocative films, the Embassy opened in 1937, but closed in 1988, to make way for an apartment tower.</p>
        <p>Regency (67th Street) Opened in 1932, it converted to a revival house in 1975, then began showing first-run films in 1987 after it was sold to Cineplex Odeon. It was closed in last year and demolished to make way for a Victoria's Secret.</p>
        <p>Cinema Studio (66th Street) Beginning in 1977, the theater attracted to a loyal following thanks to the daring programming of Daniel Talbot's New Yorker Films. It closed in 1990 when Capital Cities/ABC cleared the property it occupied, showing on its final night, appropriately, ''Cinema Paradiso.''</p>
