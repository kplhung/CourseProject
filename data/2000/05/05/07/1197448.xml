        <p>IN this still-rural enclave of Suffolk County where woods and fields have not yet given way to surburban sprawl, Uri Hason and his partner, Avi Sharabani, are carving a 76-house subdivision out of the scrub oak forest. Starting prices of $184,900 for a three-bedroom ranch and a top price of $237,900 for 2,000-square-foot, four-bedroom colonial are giving young couples buying their first homes a chance to get into the housing market.</p>
        <p>Pinewood Manor, as the 102-acre Yaphank project is called, and similarly priced developments springing up in eastern Suffolk belie the general belief that Long Island is no longer a place where first-time buyers can afford to buy new housing.</p>
        <p>These projects, which are pushing as far east as Riverhead, are reminiscent of residential developments of the 1960's when Levitt &amp; Sons and other pioneering builders ventured out to what were then untapped areas like Hauppauge and bought inexpensive land to build housing for young families just starting out.</p>
        <p>Over the 40 years since then, prices have increased tenfold, and young couples now usually need hefty down payments and two incomes to meet mortgage costs. And now  the new frontiers are Yaphank, Middle Island, Manorville and Moriches, but the appeal is the same: three- and four-bedroom moderately priced houses in new developments.</p>
        <p>At Pinewood Manor there is a choice of six different styles. The $184,900 ranch has 1,300 square feet of living area and a one-car garage. The largest house, a $234,900 colonial, has four bedrooms, 2,350 square feet and a two-car garage. Basements are included in the price. Also available is a three-bedroom, 1,350-square-foot high ranch priced at $189,900; its 1,100-square-foot windowed lower level can be finished at a future time.</p>
        <p>Contracts have been signed for 45 houses  since sales began less than four months ago, and of these, 40 percent are being purchased by first-time buyers, said Mr. Hason, whose company, Pinewood Development, is in Hicksville.</p>
        <p>Marilyn Larsen, the owner of Lane Realty in Great Neck, which is handling sales at Pinewood Manor, said, ''These developments are still catering to the affordable level.'' With a 5 percent down payment of $9,200 and taxes of $6,000 a year, a buyer purchasing the $184,900 ranch could carry the $1,880 monthly mortgage cost with an annual family income of $68,000.</p>
        <p>Among the people buying homes at Pinewood Manor are Brian Curry, 27, a sales representative for a health insurance company, and his fiancee, Kelly O'Brien, also 27, a conductor on the Long Island Rail Road.  They selected a $221,000, four-bedroom, 2,350-square-foot Victorian that will give them room for a home office and enough bedrooms for the family they want to raise.</p>
        <p>''We both have good jobs, and we have been living in our parents' homes so we were able to build up some savings,'' Mr. Curry said. With a 20 percent down payment, they estimate that their monthly mortgage payments, including taxes, will be about $1,925.</p>
        <p>''People in our situation not only can find a better deal out east, but I also love it out there,'' Mr. Curry said. Although his office is  in Uniondale, a laptop computer, fax machine and modem will allow him to work out of his new home most days of the week.</p>
        <p>The Beechwood Organization of Jericho, whose two principals are Michael Dubb and Leslie A. Lerner, is building 307 houses in a  development called Country Pointe at Manorville. Mr. Dubb said that although Manorville may seem far out, it takes only 30 minutes to drive from there to the Melville office corridor and even less time to travel to large employers like Computer Associates International in Islandia and Symbol Technologies in Holtsville.</p>
        <p>Two of the 10 different house styles being offered at Country Pointe, a 1,900-square-foot four-bedroom colonial costing $229,900 and a 2,100-square-foot four-bedroom colonial costing $239,900, were specifically designed for young couples starting out, Mr. Dubb said. A 1,500-square-foot three-bedroom ranch that was expected to appeal mostly to older couples with grown children is also attracting first-time buyers because of its $199,900 price. In the first month of sales, 25 contracts have been signed, and of those deals, 60 percent were by first-time buyers, he said.</p>
        <p>Jennifer and Richard Peck, both 30, who are buying the $229,900 colonial, both work in eastern Suffolk, Mrs. Peck as a vice president of an insurance company in Holtsville and Mr. Peck as a service representative for an industrial equipment and supplies company in Bohemia. Until now, they have been renting a one-bedroom apartment in Centereach for $700 a month.</p>
        <p>Taking on a house that will cost them close to $2,000 a month is ''a bit scary,'' Mrs. Peck said, ''but we felt it was time to move on to something that we own, and we definitely want to stay on Long Island, where we both grew up and where we have our family and friends.''</p>
        <p>Builders say that they can continue to build houses in the $190,000-to-$230,000 price range only as long as land prices in these outlying areas don't increase sharply, as they have farther west.</p>
        <p>Prices, although still relatively modest, have gone up at last 20 percent in the last two years, said Jack and Frank Campo of Port Jefferson, two land developers who assemble approved subdivisions for sale to builders. Subdivision lots in Yaphank that sold for $50,000 in 1998 now cost as much as $65,000, Jack Campo said, ''and by next year I expect prices to go to $70,000.''</p>
        <p>BUT that is still considerably below land prices to the west. For example, Lennard Axinn, a partner in Island Estates in Ronkonkoma, said he is planning  to sell houses in a 45-lot subdivision called Island Estates at Historic Yaphank at starting prices of $279,000 for 2,000 square feet and four bedrooms. A similar house would have cost $100,000 more in Melville, he said, because of higher land costs.</p>
        <p>Other developers have had similar experiences. At a subdivision called Windemere Pointe at Moriches, the Windemere Development Corporation of Hauppauge is building 90 houses priced from $219,000 for a 1,600-square-foot ranch to $259,000 for a 2,600-square-foot colonial. The lots are one acre in size. ''I've sold similar houses in the Huntington area for almost twice that because land costs are so much higher there,'' said Eric Friedlander, Windemere's president.</p>
        <p>The Park Ridge Organization of Ronkonkoma is building 109 houses in Middle Island at a development called the Preserve.  Prices there start at $181,000 for a 1,400-square-foot three-bedroom ranch and go to $260,000 for a 2,750-square-foot colonial.  One-car garages are included, but basements are optional and add $10,000 to the cost of a house. ''You can no longer go to communities like Huntington, Smithtown and Commack and buy land that allows you to build at these prices,'' said Charles B.  Mancini, vice president of the company.  Eighty houses have been placed under contract or sold since sales began a year ago, Mr. Mancini said, and about 75 percent involve first-time buyers.</p>
        <p>Developers say that they would build many more houses geared to this market if they could find land at a low enough price or if they could increase the number of houses  per acre.</p>
        <p>''That's one of the best markets to be in because it's always viable even in bad economic times,'' said Mr. Dubb of the Beechwood Organization.</p>
        <p>And moderate prices bring buyers out in force. Since sales began in February at a development of attached houses in Oakdale, 50 of the 67 houses have been placed under contract, all purchased from plans and computer images.</p>
        <p>The development called Willow Wood at Greenwood at Oakdale is being built by the Klar Organization of East Meadow on 22 acres that the company bought in 1988 when land costs were much lower. ''When we bring out a development, we look at our costs and ask what can we bring it in at to make it affordable,'' said Steven A. Klar, the company's president.</p>
        <p>The starting price at Willow Wood is $189,990 for a 1,800-square-foot two-bedroom town house. The most expensive is a three-bedroom town house with 2,160 square feet, selling for $229,990.</p>
        <p>After two years of searching for a home, Kristina and Charles Poakeart found it at Willow Wood. They are buying a three-bedroom town house for $205,000. With a 20 percent down payment, their monthly costs including taxes will be around $1,850. They are currently living in a 400-square-foot one-bedroom apartment in Bethpage, ''which we outgrew five minutes after we moved in,'' said Ms. Poakeart, 29, a network analyst for a book publisher in New York. Mr. Poakeart, 30, is the manager of a travel agency in Commack.</p>
        <p>Because of the housing costs on Long Island, they were tempted at one time to move to Arizona, an area they had explored while on vacation. Housing costs there are so much lower -- $140,000 for a nice house and much lower taxes, Ms. Poakeart said.</p>
        <p>But staying on Long Island won out. ''I got a new job,'' she said, ''and my husband got a promotion.''</p>
