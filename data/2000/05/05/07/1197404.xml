        <p>TRAFFIC jams are rare out here on the North Fork, except during the season of pumpkin madness. So it was a shock last Saturday when I turned out of the supermarket parking lot into an immobile line of traffic stretching as far as I could see. After about a mile of inching along, the road widened and cars started to swing around the obstruction at the head of the line. When it was my turn, I saw the cause of the problem: an open white carriage drawn by two elderly horses at a steady speed of about four miles an hour in the direction of the nearest catering hall.</p>
        <p>It's wedding season; how could I forget, after being bombarded with all the special advertising supplements and soft-focus television commercials? As I passed the horse-drawn coach, I glanced at the happy couple. It was a chilly day, and they were huddled in the open carriage turning a nice shade of pale blue. Whatever their honeymoon plans might have been, a few days in the hospital with pneumonia seemed a more likely outcome of this romantic ride along Route 25A. But the show must go on, especially when the show is a wedding.</p>

        <p>TRAFFIC jams are rare out here on the North Fork, except during the season of pumpkin madness. So it was a shock last Saturday when I turned out of the supermarket parking lot into an immobile line of traffic stretching as far as I could see. After about a mile of inching along, the road widened and cars started to swing around the obstruction at the head of the line. When it was my turn, I saw the cause of the problem: an open white carriage drawn by two elderly horses at a steady speed of about four miles an hour in the direction of the nearest catering hall.</p>
        <p>It's wedding season; how could I forget, after being bombarded with all the special advertising supplements and soft-focus television commercials? As I passed the horse-drawn coach, I glanced at the happy couple. It was a chilly day, and they were huddled in the open carriage turning a nice shade of pale blue. Whatever their honeymoon plans might have been, a few days in the hospital with pneumonia seemed a more likely outcome of this romantic ride along Route 25A. But the show must go on, especially when the show is a wedding.</p>
        <p>In everyday life we mostly play ourselves, a part we've practiced since childhood. But a big wedding is a true theatrical performance, with a cast consisting entirely of amateurs who have to make up many of their own lines as they go along. Anyone who has been involved with amateur dramatic productions knows just how disastrous this can be.</p>
        <p>Consider the matter of costume. The central, almost iconographic costume in this production is the wedding dress. Most are pure white, blatantly contravening the laws against false and misleading advertising. These outfits cost, on average, $800, but they can easily be $3,000 or much more, according to a 1998 New York Times article, although they can always be recycled for future weddings. Our local dry cleaner has a special wedding gown cleaning service. But, even the second or third time around, very few women look their best in a long, white gown. It takes height, slimness and an aristocratic poise to carry it off. Audrey Hepburn could do it. The models in wedding magazines can do it. Not everybody can do it.</p>
        <p>As for the men on this ephemeral stage, no modern man can look less than ridiculous in an Oxford gray cutaway, with a double-breasted waistcoat, striped pants and a silk top hat, even if he remembers to take his baseball cap off first.</p>
        <p>But it's the stage set, the flimsy scenery, that gives the whole thing away. Wedding receptions are staged in a range of settings, from old mansions and hotels to country clubs, yacht clubs, vineyards, motels and catering halls. The essential backdrop never varies: a lawn, a bridge, a fountain, a pond or water view, an arbor or gazebo, some white pillars. These items, even when placed right beside a busy highway, are supposed to provide the right romantic atmosphere, and a backdrop for the inevitable photographs and videos.</p>
        <p>The gigantic wedding industry is dedicated to keeping the old traditions alive, especially the tradition of spending a lot of money. There are two and a half million weddings a year, and the average cost is $20,000, according to a recent article in The Philadelphia Inquirer. Our local news dealer carries four big magazines especially for brides, who, in spite of the divorce rate, must surely be a rather transitory readership. The biggest in every sense are Brides and Modern Bride, which sell almost half a million copies an issue, and this month contain 690 pages and 560 pages respectively. Martha Stewart Wedding has 344 pages, and Elegant Bride comes in at a paltry 223 pages, making a grand total of 1,817 pages. This is approximately the size of the complete Riverside edition of Shakespeare. There is a new magazine this year, For the Groom. This is only 128 pages long, and printed on cheap paper. The headline feature is ''How to Survive the Stress.''</p>
        <p>I've got nothing against romance. Romance is surprise, impulse, joy -- the smile across a crowded room, the unexpected kiss, the impulsive motorbike ride across a Greek island. But this programmed, packaged, videotaped extravaganza is the reverse of romantic. I can see why some couples rebel against the wedding industry, and get married barefoot on the beach, or in a casino or in a hot-air balloon.</p>
        <p>But the traditional wedding is the closest most of us ever come to being the stars of our own show. It must be perfect. It must be rehearsed, as few other things in life ever are. And when everything is just right, we have the photographer and videographer to record the moment as we would like to remember it. The magic technique of digital photography now allows images to be ''improved'' until they are barely recognizable.</p>
        <p>The wedding, always a fanciful ritual, is moving closer and closer to being pure theater and nothing to do with matrimony at all. And it may be time to discard the archaic connection between weddings and marriages. Those who enjoy weddings could then have as many as they could afford. The bridegroom (a sad burden) and his best man (a guaranteed embarrassment) could be replaced by tall, good-looking actors temporarily unemployed on the soap opera circuit. They would be word-perfect in their lines, socially skilled and adequately sober. And they would go home after the performance, leaving the bride free to get on with her real life.</p>
