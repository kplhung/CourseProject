        <p>AT 1:30 a.m. on a recent Saturday, Milk &amp; Honey, a tiny bar on the Lower East Side, was jammed for one of the few times since it opened in January.

        <p>AT 1:30 a.m. on a recent Saturday, Milk &amp; Honey, a tiny bar on the Lower East Side, was jammed for one of the few times since it opened in January. But instead of feeling elated, the 27-year-old owner, who had barely been able to make the rent until a few weeks ago, scooped up the discarded martini glasses and cast a disapproving eye on the cheery crowd.</p>
        <p>''They're breaking the rules,'' he said, raising his brows in concern. ''Men are talking to women all over the place without permission.''</p>
        <p>It was amazing that anyone was in the bar at all, considering the effort made to hide it among the grated storefronts and overflowing garbage cans on an unassuming block near Delancey Street. Not only is there no sign, but the place is as disguised as, in the words of the owner, ''an old Jewish tailor shop.'' The word Alterations, in fact, was freshly painted in an antiquated style on the store window. Behind it was a dusty mannequin dressed in a ratty three-piece suit.</p>
        <p>To gain admission, would-be patrons must phone at least 20 minutes ahead, have their references approved, then traverse a pitch-black hallway. Anyone caught knocking or talking while waiting to be admitted is blacklisted.</p>
        <p>''The service I'm offering is an idiot-free environment safe from celebrity sycophants and frat boys who read the listings in Time Out,'' said the owner, who agreed to be interviewed only if his bar's exact location was not revealed and he was identified by his first name only, Sasha. ''Unfortunately, hiding my bar was the only way I could think of to do it these days.''</p>
        <p>These may seem like extreme measures, but Sasha is the most extreme example of a small contingent of night life entrepreneurs less dedicated to cultivating heat and hype than avoiding it. They've had enough of clubs and bars used as promotional venues, that act as hosts of parties sponsored by liquor companies and  where paparazzi are planted at every velvet rope.</p>
        <p>New clubs striving for the cachet of bold-faced names shell out small fortunes for publicists to broker premiere parties and other promotional events. The scenes are all but interchangeable: clipboard-wielding list-keepers in headsets part the sea of beautiful but not famous guests to make way for limousines with celebrities. The next day, the spectacle is chronicled in the tabloids, and legions of readers form the impression of a hot new destination they must go to as soon as possible.</p>
        <p>The prepackaged hoopla has created something of a backlash. A wave of secretive bars have lately cropped up, from the simple SoHo establishment on the corner of Spring and Sullivan Streets with no sign, no name and blacked out windows, to bars modeled after old Mafia social clubs, to the underground Milk &amp; Honey.</p>
        <p>The trick is to stay hype-free, catering to a small but loyal crowd, and make enough money to remain in business. It's not so easy, as Ian Stell and Michael Drury learned. As owners of the popular downtown scenes Orchard Bar and Double Happiness, they opened the secretive Wyanoka last year, hoping to provide a laid-back environment for the art world. Located upstairs from Double Happiness on Mott Street in Little Italy, Wyanoka was an apartment-like single room with decor inspired by the mobster gambling parlor that formerly occupied the space. The only clue to its existence was a tiny logo of a Wyanoka Indian on a plain metal door. The initiated would slide a special membership card through an A.T.M.-like slot. But exclusivity couldn't pay the bills, and the two partners closed down after eight months. They are now converting it to a restaurant.</p>
        <p>''The only way a bar like this could work is if the owner was extremely dedicated,'' Mr. Stell said. Sasha turns out to be that owner. He sees himself as a kind of Holden Caulfield of night life, scorning ''phonies'' and crusading against lapsed values. In addition to his strict entrance policy, he has eight house rules posted in the bathrooms and strictly enforced. Rule No. 1 is ''No name dropping.''</p>
        <p>''Anyone who thinks that celebrities are the new aristocrats will not be tolerated,'' Sasha said. ''They are the most tedious people in the world.''</p>
        <p>''The bar is for people who feel responsibility, not entitlement,'' he added, volleying the incoming requests for entry on a rotary phone and whipping up elaborate cocktails with egg whites and hand-squeezed citrus. ''If Puffy showed up here in a limo, he could come in as long as he had a reservation and could obey my rules,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Other rules include: ''Don't tell anyone about this place unless you would leave that person alone in your apartment,'' and ''Gentlemen will not introduce themselves to ladies. You may not speak to a woman to whom you have not been introduced. Wait for her to speak to you, or ask the bartender for an introduction.'' That is the rule most often broken.</p>
        <p>Sasha maintains a Rolodex with all of his customers' names in it, cross-referenced with the initials of the person who recommended them. If either party breaks the rules, the card is torn up and both are banished. Sasha said he heard that this screening method was practiced by a secret Yale University club or an illegal after-hours gambling parlor. He also plans to install a video surveillance system on the front door to screen the guests, as soon as he can raise $2,500.</p>
        <p>He opened the club with money that he, his sister and three friends he met while at Stuyvesant High School borrowed against their credit cards, between $10,000 and $15,000 each. The debts are still outstanding; all of the revenues from the bar are put back in the business.</p>
        <p>''So far I haven't had to physically kick anyone out,'' he said. ''I find the best way to make people leave is to make them think it is their idea. I just speak to them like I'm scolding a child in a stern disapproving voice. They usually apologize and then never come back.''</p>
        <p>In many ways, Milk &amp; Honey is like a Prohibition-era speakeasy. Sasha wears only old-fashioned  clothes: suspenders, high-waisted pleated trousers and a fedora. He plays jazz and soul from the 1920's and 1950's. The bar is made of solid oak, the banquettes are leather and the walls are plaster, not sheet rock. Hat hooks are provided. The bathroom is stocked with meticulously rolled cloth towels. No Bounty here.</p>
        <p>Only top-shelf liquor is served, though Sasha refuses to serve drinks he deems fratlike. These include woo woos, kamikazes and shots of any kind. If you sit at a table long enough, a silver tray will arrive with long-stemmed strawberries drizzled with honey, or freshly shucked oysters.</p>
        <p>Clearly, Milk &amp; Honey isn't for everyone. Many one-time patrons who have been chastised for sitting on the tables, whistling loudly or trying to pick up women refer to it as ''that rule place'' and have complained that the atmosphere is a ''buzz kill.'' But most of the regulars are extremely loyal and protective. When Sasha gets too busy (he is the only employee other than one part-timer), they help out by answering the phone, opening the door and escorting ''ladies'' to taxis.</p>
        <p>''There are enough good people out there to fill up a 500-square-foot bar,'' Sasha said. ''But I doubt there are enough to fill up 1,000 square feet.''</p>
        <p>Felix Salmon, 28, an English journalist, who was leaning against a polished brick wall last Saturday night, said: ''If I broke one of the rules, I'd feel dreadful. It would be like talking during the opera.''</p>
