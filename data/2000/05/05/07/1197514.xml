        <p>Six weeks after William Willet was appointed Nassau County Police Commissioner and began a campaign to trim jobs and streamline the department, cracks have begun to develop in the composure of leaders of the county's three major police unions.</p>
        <p>Union leaders may have disagreed in private, but publicly portrayed a united front. Now tempers have flared out in the open with an accusation that the Nassau Superior Officers Association, which represents every officer above the rank of patrolman, was bearing too large a share of the job-cut burden.</p>
        <p>Before he officially took over, Commissioner Willett asked for the resignation of three of the top chiefs in the department, and late last month he reassigned or did not replace 37 high-ranking officials. In those same orders, only 12 police officers were transferred.</p>
        <p>The Superior Officers Association president, Nick Baudo, accused Gary DelaRaba, whose Police Benevolent Association president represents the rank and file, of backstabbing.</p>
        <p>''He should worry about his cops and stop worrying about the other unions' business,'' Mr. Baudo said. ''He should mind his own business and stick with his own union.''</p>
        <p>Mr. DelaRaba, a longtime supporter of County Executive Thomas S. Gulotta and a financial contributor to his campaigns, has at least temporarily held at bay a plan by Mr. Gulotta to lay off 277 members of his union and has voiced his opinion that the department should get rid of many of the administrative positions in headquarters.</p>
        <p>Responding to Mr. Baudo, Mr. DelaRaba said: ''He has a parochial view on the issue. I question people's agenda when they put their own personal agenda ahead of what is good for the people and good for the Police Department.''</p>
        <p>The most recent changes in the department affect every precinct, changing the administrative structure from three administrators to two.</p>
        <p>Critics of these new procedures argue that there is not enough supervision under the present conditions.</p>
