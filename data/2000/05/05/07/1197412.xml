        <p>THE offices of Wrenchead.com in White Plains might easily be mistaken for those of a Silicon Valley startup. The staff, mostly in their 20's and 30's, sit hunched over computer screens, working in shifts on a 24-hour schedule and hoping to make their Web site a household word.</p>
        <p>But beside the screens are photographs of Nascar races and classic cars. On the walls are framed covers from old hot-rod magazines, and a photograph of a souped-up yellow 1970 Plymouth Superbird.</p>

        <p>THE offices of Wrenchead.com in White Plains might easily be mistaken for those of a Silicon Valley startup. The staff, mostly in their 20's and 30's, sit hunched over computer screens, working in shifts on a 24-hour schedule and hoping to make their Web site a household word.</p>
        <p>But beside the screens are photographs of Nascar races and classic cars. On the walls are framed covers from old hot-rod magazines, and a photograph of a souped-up yellow 1970 Plymouth Superbird.</p>
        <p>Auto parts and the Web may seem like odd bedfellows. But for Wrenchead's chief executive officer, Gus Conrades, who rebuilt a '57 Chevy Belair and a '51 Mercury for fun in high school and worked at three Internet startups before setting up Wrenchead last year with his cousin Bryan Murphy, the pairing was a way to bring the two sides of his life together.</p>
        <p>''When Bryan and I started this, it was really an extension of all our experiences,'' he said. ''We had a reason to do this; it was something we really loved. I've been a wrenchead since I was 3.''</p>
        <p>It is also an idea with enormous potential, judging by the $120 million-plus that Wrenchead has drawn from investors since it was incorporated just over a year ago. The lead investment came from Polaris Venture Partners, a Boston-based venture capital firm where Mr. Conrades's father became a partner in 1998. Mr. Conrades's Wall Street connections -- he worked briefly at Lazard Freres for a year after college -- helped draw in Goldman Sachs, Paine Webber, CBS and SFX Entertainment.</p>
        <p>Wrenchead's site, like those of its competitors, allows you to type in your car's make and model, find the part you need and have it delivered. For those who don't want to get their hands dirty -- known in the trade as DIFM's (Do It for Me) -- Wrenchead will soon have an online referral service to link users to a local garage that will pick up the car, fix it and return it.</p>
        <p>But Wrenchead doesn't just want to be a retailer. Instead, it hopes to reinvent the entire parts industry, which is rife with inefficiency. When you take your old VW into a garage, the mechanic looks at it and sees that you need a new oxygen sensor. He calls his warehouse, which may not have the part in stock. He might call a parts supplier or even a junkyard, and they might not have it either.</p>
        <p>Wrenchead and its competitors have already improved on this model. Instead of building its own warehouse, Wrenchead has relationships with multiple vendors, giving it access to a much larger catalog of parts than most traditional suppliers.</p>
        <p>Eventually, the company would like to have everyone on the supply chain -- manufacturers, warehouses, garages and car owners -- using the Wrenchead site and special software that Wrenchead has developed. The idea is to streamline the process, not to cut any middlemen out. ''It's a supply chain tuneup, not blowup,'' Mr. Conrades said. The idea is for orders to be processed faster and more efficiently, and Wrenchead will skim a growing profit off the top as its base of customers grows.</p>
        <p>Trouble is, Wrenchead is a newcomer in the $32 billion automotive parts industry.  The only real advantage it has over traditional suppliers like Pep Boys and Parts America is its presence on the Web. In theory, one of the suppliers Wrenchead works with -- or a group of them -- could decide to start their own Internet parts service. Then there is the fact that Wrenchead faces stiff competition from other startups, like Parts.com and Autoparts.com, which are trying to do exactly the same thing.</p>
        <p>''The challenge facing the independents is: how do you entice the leaders of the industry to join, versus setting up their own exchange?'' said Tim Longnecker, an automotive and internet analyst at Dynamis Solutions.</p>
        <p>Wrenchead's investors say they are confident that their Web expertise and strong management skills are what count. And so far, Mr. Conrades says he has been pleased with the company's success. He said that more than a million people used the site in February alone. He will not say when he expects to start making a profit, or when the company might go public.</p>
        <p>So far, Wrenchead's strategy has been to focus on car lovers and mechanics. The Wrenchead site itself is an effort to bring the grease-and-overalls flavor of popular mechanics to the Web. It includes a monster truck show schedule, collectible car information and a ''pit crew'' section -- a forum for car lovers complete with photographs of beefy mechanics and their cars.</p>
        <p>But since most car guys are still more likely to be found at auto races than on the Web, Wrenchead is also promoting its name and logo at racing events and on television and radio. It is the title sponsor of the U.S. Hot Rod Associaton's Monster Jam, thanks to its alliance with SFX Entertainment, the nation's largest producer and promoter of live auto events. And it will be featured on motor sports and do-it-yourself repair shows through CBS, which bought a 22 percent equity stake in Wrenchead for $33 million last August.</p>
        <p>Why did Wrenchead choose to set up shop in Westchester, rather than California or  Silicon Alley in Manhattan?</p>
        <p>For starters, Mr. Conrades, a burly 32-year-old who races motorcycles professionally in his spare time, grew up in Greenwich and still lives there. Westchester gave him access to the New York City region's talent pool while paying considerably less for office space than he would in the city. Wrenchead employs 40 people, about half of whom commute from the city.</p>
