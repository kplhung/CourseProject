        <p>Johnny Cash once said that one of the secrets of his 32-year union with June Carter Cash, his wife and fellow country music legend, was separate bathrooms. ''The lady needs her space,'' he explained recently. ''Not everyone can afford it, but it can be a real marriage-saver.'' The Cashes' his-and-hers bathrooms say as much about the couple's personalities as they do about their nearly five decades as Nashville's reigning monarchs.</p>
        <p>Johnny Cash's surprisingly tiny bathroom had been much larger, but he converted most of it to a library for his books on topics ranging from the Bible (''I own every translation'') to ancient Greek and Roman coins (which he collects). ''Every writer has an upper room,'' Cash says, ''and this is mine.'' The space left over for the bathroom hardly seems big enough to accommodate the Man in Black, who at 68 and in spite of ill health hasn't lost his dark, magnetic presence. But the bathroom is luxurious nonetheless, with velvet-covered walls and an onyx sink.</p>

        <p>Johnny Cash once said that one of the secrets of his 32-year union with June Carter Cash, his wife and fellow country music legend, was separate bathrooms. ''The lady needs her space,'' he explained recently. ''Not everyone can afford it, but it can be a real marriage-saver.'' The Cashes' his-and-hers bathrooms say as much about the couple's personalities as they do about their nearly five decades as Nashville's reigning monarchs.</p>
        <p>Johnny Cash's surprisingly tiny bathroom had been much larger, but he converted most of it to a library for his books on topics ranging from the Bible (''I own every translation'') to ancient Greek and Roman coins (which he collects). ''Every writer has an upper room,'' Cash says, ''and this is mine.'' The space left over for the bathroom hardly seems big enough to accommodate the Man in Black, who at 68 and in spite of ill health hasn't lost his dark, magnetic presence. But the bathroom is luxurious nonetheless, with velvet-covered walls and an onyx sink.</p>
        <p>June Carter Cash's bathroom, on the other hand, is pure country diva -- perfect for the madonnalike, charming singer and songwriter who at 70 just won a third Grammy, for her album ''Press On.'' A wall of gold-veined mirror, a bathtub the size of Tennessee and gilded, girly furniture vie for attention with framed photographs of family, friends and celebrities like Paul and Linda McCartney, Prince Charles and James Dean, who ''once gave me a rose, and that's all I'm ever going to say about it.''</p>
        <p>''I use this room as an office -- I rehearse here and I pray here,'' she does say, picking a pair of green and brown, high-heeled Prada Mary Janes off the floor. Her husband once said that she had ''a black belt in shopping''; by her own admission, she owns 215 beds. And she's no slouch in the jewelry department either, wearing a Harry Winston diamond ring the size of an ice cube. ''It's embarrassing,'' she replies when asked how many carats it is, ''so I won't tell you.'' But from someone with such a fabulous bathroom, a little old chip would be awfully disappointing.</p>
