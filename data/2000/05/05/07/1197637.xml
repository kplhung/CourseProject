        <p>''Oh la la, I love it,'' said Anne Paris, the manager at Caron, a unisex French perfume shop that opened last month at 675 Madison Avenue (61st Street). Ms. Paris, combining English with her native French, was describing the Caron fountains, 12 Baccarat crystal urns filled with perfume. Created for Caron and modeled after the ones in the Caron boutique in Paris, the fountains spill perfume with names like N'Aimez Que Moi (Forget Me Not) and Pois de Senteur (Sweet Pea). The perfume is sold by volume (7.5 milliliters for $80; 200 for $500). A full urn (which someone did buy in Paris) sells for about $10,000.</p>

        <p>The history of Caron perfumes lies in a French love story that began almost a century ago. Ernest Daltroff was the ''nose'' and Felicie Vanpouille was the marketer. To fit the times, they blended Tabac Blond in 1919 to dissipate tobacco odor, and En Avion in 1930 to celebrate Amelia Earhart's trans-Atlantic flight of 1928. In 1939, when Mr. Daltroff fled the Nazis and moved to the United States, he envisioned a perfume to commemorate the approach to Ellis Island. But he died two years later without the chance to create it. Caron is now introducing Lady Caron, a tribute to America and the Statue of Liberty.</p>
