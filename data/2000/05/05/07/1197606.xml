        <p>THERE is nothing like a blank screen to spark one's imagination. It is the Rorschach test of the information age. And never more so than last week, when the ABC channel on Time Warner cable systems in seven markets went blank.</p>
        <p>ABC devotees in 3.5 million homes, confronted with a blue screen and scrolling Time Warner propaganda, may have thought about the celebrities they would not see. Marketers of satellite dishes probably contemplated fatter sales figures. And federal lawmakers and regulators could ponder how to prevent the gatekeepers of the information castle from pulling up the drawbridge and leaving the public outside.</p>
        <p>More than anything else, for those who have believed in technology's implied promise of an information utopia, in which people can see or hear or read whatever they want (and show or tell or write whatever they want), it was an uncomfortable reminder: the more information available, the more places in which it is available, the more the logic of economics and egos will come into play to restrict it.</p>
        <p>As Floyd Abrams, the noted First Amendment lawyer, said in a speech to the Mercer Law School in Georgia in March, ''paradoxically, the effect of more information becoming more available more quickly may be less information being made public at all.''</p>
        <p>Consider the evidence for Mr. Abrams's paradox. Last week, to gain leverage in its contract dispute over the terms under which it could carry ABC, which is owned by the Walt Disney Company, Time Warner pulled the plug on ABC programming.</p>
        <p>During the negotiations -- Disney was seeking to make its Disney Channel part of Time Warner's basic service and to get the cable systems to carry its Toon Disney and Soap channels -- Disney sometimes engaged in brinkmanship. In the Houston market, Disney came within minutes of letting Time Warner's right to carry its programming lapse. If it had done so, it would have pulled the plug on itself.</p>
        <p>Disney was offering more programming (which in turn would bring it more advertisements and more revenue). Time Warner's cable system is capable of carrying scores of channels. But both media giants, under the terms of the laws, regulations and contracts governing their business, could serve as gatekeepers and black out the signal. More information, or less? Or more information and more choke points where it can be shut off?</p>
        <p>In other situations, the promise of open access to free information has also produced a backlash:</p>
        <p>* APBNews.com, a Web site specializing in covering crime stories and the legal system, filed a Freedom of Information Act request for all the financial disclosure statements filed by federal judges. At first, the financial disclosure committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States rejected the request, citing judges' concerns that unstable or unsavory people could obtain their addresses or the names of family members. In March, the Judicial Conference ruled that the reports could not be withheld ''simply because they are going to be placed on the Internet.''</p>
        <p>* The Associated Press, Reuters and three other international news agencies preparing to cover the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney were asked in January if they would wait an hour before making results available to commercial Web sites, including their own, and if they would credit I.B.M. and Swatch when reporting the results. The A.P. argued that the results are raw data, not subject to copyright protections.</p>
        <p>Franklin Servan-Schreiber, the director of communications and new media for the International Olympic Committee, withdrew the requests for the time being. He maintains that copyright protections extend to ''the tabulation'' of results, if not the results themselves. ''The agencies want to take the real-time results and resend it, with no value added, to other Web sites -- and give us no compensation,'' he said. ''And those Web sites would be competitive with our Web site.''</p>
        <p>* The Association of Research Libraries and various teachers' organizations are fighting legislation that would provide electronic databases with copyright-like protections. Leslie Harris, a lawyer who represents some teacher groups, said, ''You want protections to encourage creation of intellectual property, but you also want to encourage dissemination of information in a free society.'' She added, ''As we migrate online, the traditional ability of my clients to say, 'Great article on Martin Luther King Day; I'll make 15 copies for my class' may not be possible.''</p>
        <p>In such cases, laws governing intellectual property and freedom of information overlap with the laws governing information distribution systems and the antitrust laws. Which is not surprising, since a basic premise of the information age is that information itself has economic value.</p>
        <p>Arguably, it is a matter of civic interest if television viewers are barred from receiving ABC News programming. The issue for the Federal Communications Commission, though, was not the free flow of information, but the fact that the plug was pulled during sweeps month, when stations measure their audiences to determine what to charge advertisers.</p>
        <p>If a city council wants to force a cable carrier to carry any Internet service provider, it is a matter of business regulation. (Federal judges in Oregon and Virginia have come to opposite conclusions on the propriety of such actions.) On the other hand, it is a matter of copyright law if the National Football League objects when a reporter from The St. Paul Pioneer Press gives real-time coverage on a Vikings game via the newspaper's Web site. And a matter of competition, since the N.F.L. also has its own Web site.</p>
        <p>In a recent article in Release 1.0, Esther Dyson's technology newsletter, the Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig said: ''The original architecture of the Net gave great freedom to perfect competition. But we're seeing an erosion of that freedom now.''</p>
