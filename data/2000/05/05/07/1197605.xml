        <p>Drug courts, which divert nonviolent, first-time offenders to supervised treatment rather than jail, are effective, yet put additional strain on scarce resources. Welfare reforms likewise require sobriety but put little money into treatment and prevention.

        <p>Substance abuse costs this country $277 billion per year in medical costs, crime and lost productivity, yet only half of those who seek treatment can get it on demand. The support for treatment expressed by the candidates bodes well for our nation's future.</p>
