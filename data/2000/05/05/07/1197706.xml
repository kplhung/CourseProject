        <p>On the eve of Game 1 between the Knicks and the Miami Heat, there was the unsettling sight of Patrick Ewing sitting gingerly on a table beside the court as his team ended its last workout before the four-of-seven-game second-round series.</p>
        <p>After missing practice with back spasms today, Ewing's ability to play on Sunday in Miami will be a game-time decision. Ewing said today that if he had to play a game when he first felt the spasms during practice on Friday, he could not have performed.</p>
        <p>''Yesterday, no; today, maybe; tomorrow, wild horses couldn't drag me away,'' Ewing said at the Knicks' practice facility at SUNY-Purchase. ''My goal is to play.''</p>
        <p>Ewing will be receiving around-the-clock treatment for the spasms, an injury he has not had before this season. But Coach Jeff Van Gundy said the team would be ready whether Ewing played or not.</p>
        <p>''Obviously, we'd like to have everyone healthy,'' Van Gundy said. ''But if he's not, the game is at 12:30 p.m. We've played without him before. We'll play, regardless. But, obviously, he makes us a lot better.''</p>
        <p>Heat guard Tim Hardaway said Ewing's absence could benefit the Knicks in some ways.</p>
        <p>''I think that makes things a lot better, because they space it out and the guards get to go to the hole a lot more,'' Hardaway said. ''Their defense is much more aggressive. They're confident with him. They're even more confident without him. It opens the lane for them.</p>
        <p>''I'm not saying they're a better team without Patrick. I think they're a better team with Patrick because he gives them a lot of stuff down low -- just like 'Zo does for us.''</p>
        <p>Two years ago, in the 1998 playoff series against the Heat, the Knicks eliminated Pat Riley's team without Ewing, who was healing from surgery on his broken wrist. Van Gundy called on Charles Oakley and Buck Williams as well as Chris Dudley.</p>
        <p>This time, Dudley could be used in the starting lineup. And Van Gundy could also ask more from the Knicks' backup power forwards, Kurt Thomas and John Wallace, to counter Alonzo Mourning.</p>
        <p>The two 6-foot-9-inch forwards, who have seen limited action in the playoffs, bring different assets to the team. Thomas, much stronger defensively, can muscle Mourning in the post, while Wallace's offensive touch could draw the Heat center out from the basket.</p>
        <p>Dudley, who has made a career of being ready when and if called to spell more accomplished teammates, was confident in his ability to substitute for an ailing Ewing.</p>
        <p>''I just go out and try to make it difficult for Alonzo, just like I've done in the past,'' Dudley said. ''I probably won't know about playing until game time, unless Patrick wakes up and says he feels great. I'm assuming he'll play, but you're always ready just in case.''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>Guard TIM HARDAWAY will most likely start for the Miami Heat on Sunday after three weeks of rehabilitation for an injured left foot. ''I'm 85 to 90 percent, right around there,'' Hardaway said Saturday after the Heat's practice in Miami. ''I'm just going to try to do whatever I can do for the team. Run the show. Make it easier for everybody.'' . . . The Heat has not played since April 29, and Coach PAT RILEY is concerned about the eight-day layoff. ''It's not natural for players or teams to be off this long,'' he said. Of his team, he added, '' I hope we haven't given them too much to prepare.''</p>
