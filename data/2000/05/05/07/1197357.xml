        <p>SOMETIMES, even the professionals have to avert their eyes.</p>
        <p>''I could barely watch it,'' Vance DeGeneres, a veteran comedy writer and performer on Comedy Central's ''Daily Show,'' said of the incident on ''Late Show with David Letterman.''  ''It was almost like watching those films where they're clubbing the baby seal to death.''</p>
        <p>The ''it'' was, perhaps, the most uncomfortable moment of political humor of the television season. After weeks of goading by Mr. Letterman, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas agreed to appear by satellite on his show, an encounter that was, by most assessments, a disaster for the Republican presidential candidate. Mr. Bush, hampered by the split-second time delay and projecting an air of being led on a forced march, offered one lame quip after another, including a pun about Mr. Letterman's recent heart operation so strained that it left the host staring, mortified, into the camera.</p>
        <p>The episode was instructive not only about how truly dangerous a tete-a-tete with a witty talk-show host can be, but also about how much clout television comedy wields in the shaping of political perceptions. In a recent survey by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, roughly one in 10 Americans said they routinely gleaned information about the presidential race from late-night talk shows like the ones presided over by Mr. Letterman and Jay Leno; nearly as many said that they regularly obtained political news from other shows, like ''Saturday Night Live'' and ''Politically Incorrect,''  ''The Daily Show'' and ''Mad TV.''</p>
        <p>The proportion of viewers admitting that they get their politics from television comedy may not be overwhelming. But considering that the 1996 presidential election was decided by a mere eight percentage points, what each and every consumer of comedy on television takes away from the experience can be highly significant.</p>
        <p>''I tend to believe that,'' said Dick Blasucci, the executive producer of ''Mad TV,'' Fox's Saturday night comedy show. ''Look: what killed Dan Quayle was the beating up by Jay Leno and others. I'm not saying they were taking sides, but I do think that kind of stuff leaves an impression.''</p>
        <p>Having a serious impact on real events is, of course, the last thing on the minds of most of the writers and performers of political satire on television. ''I just want the politicians and the people who watch our show to know that this is a place where the buck honestly stops,'' said Bill Maher, the no-nonsense host of ''Politically Incorrect,'' ABC's freewheeling after-hours talkfest. Still, as the Bush appearance on ''Letterman'' illustrates, political comedy relies ever more intensively on the willing (and in some instances unwitting) participation of actual officeholders and officeseekers.</p>
        <p>That is attributable, at least in part, to the blurring of the line between politics and entertainment, a boundary that has been fading since the psychedelic days of ''Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In,'' on which, in 1968, a dour politician by the name of Richard M. Nixon, in a startling cameo, uttered the show's stock phrase ''Sock it to me?'' into the camera. If self-mockery once seemed a bit of an indignity for politicians, nowadays they jump at the chance to make 'em laugh. Members of Congress appear as panelists along with country singers, rappers and actors on ''Politically Incorrect.'' Former presidential candidates -- even former presidents -- show up at benefits as agreeable sidekicks to their ''Saturday Night Live'' impersonators.</p>
        <p>C-Span has gotten into the act, broadcasting an annual evening of stand-up comedy from Washington, in which reporters like Walter Shapiro of USA Today and lawmakers like Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut perform their 10 minutes of shtick. And in what may just be the slyest marriage of politics and comedy on television, ''The Daily Show,'' the satirical four-nights-a-week news and talk show with the comedian Jon Stewart as host, has hired the former Senator Bob Dole as an election-year commentator. (Mr. Dole declined an interview request.)</p>
        <p>''The Daily Show,'' with its deadpan reports from a comic corral of field correspondents and sidelong glances at the day's headlines, has developed a reputation for offering some of the shrewdest political foolery on the small screen. ''We had a blast working with them,'' said Todd Harris, who served as press secretary for the New Hampshire primary campaign of Senator John McCain, to which ''The Daily Show'' attached one of its performers, Steve Carell, for a mock news piece.</p>
        <p>''After the piece came out, we had a tape of it on board the Straight Talk Express,'' Mr. Harris said, ''and every couple of weeks or so Senator McCain stopped everything and said, 'Let's watch the Comedy Central tape!' ''</p>
        <p>The segment followed Mr. Carell's exploits as he tried vainly to get a seat on Mr. McCain's bus, a conceit that was inherently funny: Mr. McCain had become instantly legendary for the generous access he provided to the press. ''So there was a very humorous irony there,'' Mr. Harris said, ''but there was also a deeper irony in the fact that we were a serious presidential campaign, allowing them to partake of this irony.''</p>
        <p>It was just the sort of piece that ''The Daily Show,'' and its ongoing ''Indecision 2000'' election coverage, revels in. For the past 16 months, the program's anchor desk has been manned by Mr. Stewart. (Before that, it was the perch of Craig Kilborn, whose talk show now follows Mr. Letterman's on CBS.) Mr. Stewart, along with Madeleine Smithberg, the executive producer, oversees a staff of 60 writers, producers and technicians who work out of the show's headquarters on a desolate midtown Manhattan side street a block from the West Side Highway. The 30-minute program is a kind of comic cocktail of reality and parody. ''We are a fake news organization,'' Mr. Stewart said, ''but we feel the ups and downs that real news organizations feel.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stewart sets a benign tone with political guests. There is a compassionate quality to his interviews that reflects a higher level of affection for politics than that displayed in the cranky irreverence of Mr. Letterman or the jokey, disconnected chatter of Mr. Leno. ''I believe if these people come on our show, they should have the respect they're owed by virtue of the office they're in,'' Mr. Stewart said. ''I want them to feel comfortable.''</p>
        <p>The show, in fact, has gained a following in political circles for its hipness and sense of fun. ''He is so fast, if he were a shortstop, he would pick up everything,'' Representative Dennis J. Kucinich, a Cleveland Democrat, said of Mr. Stewart. ''And he realizes that he is prospecting in very rich territory.''</p>
        <p>On ''Politically Incorrect,'' Mr. Maher's style is decidedly less ingratiating: he puts everyone on the hot seat. ''Not that I insult the movie stars, but my show lives on the premise that I never pull a punch,'' he said. As a result, he says, some potential political guests remain leery.</p>
        <p>''Dan Quayle was booked on our show recently and then pulled out,'' Mr. Maher said, adding that he was told that ''something I said'' about the former vice president had upset his handlers and that ''they wanted me to apologize.'' Mr. Maher declined.</p>
        <p>He is aware, though, that his blunt style has power. Asked, for instance, if he had invited Mr. Bush on his show, Mr. Maher laughed at the improbability of such an appearance. ''I've been so hard on him,'' he said. (He added that he was not a fan of Vice President Al Gore, either.)</p>
        <p>IT may be just as well that Mr. Bush steers clear of the program, given his performance on ''Letterman,'' a show that has become a kind of political proving ground. Gerard Mulligan, a longtime staff writer, said that Mr. Letterman ''discovered inadvertently'' just how gravely candidates respond to his comic denunciations. For weeks, he complained on the air about Hillary Rodham Clinton's refusal to appear on the show after announcing her campaign for the Senate seat from New York.</p>
        <p>''He said, 'The road to the Senate goes through this chair,' a spur-of-the-moment thing,'' Mr. Mulligan recalled. Soon enough, Mrs. Clinton was seated opposite Mr. Letterman and submitting to a pop civics test about New York, in which the host quizzed her on the name of the state tree and bird.</p>
        <p>It is a measure of how important a sense of humor on camera has become to political discourse that candidates feel real pressure to perform. As Mrs. Clinton all but said to Mr. Letterman, her appearance on his show was as obligatory a part of her race as a whistle-stop tour of the Western tier. The tacit and attractive acknowledgment to voters in such a booking is that a candidate is serious about running but not so serious about themselves. ''You have to prove you're a good sport,'' Mr. Mulligan said.</p>
        <p>The notion of a political personality able to give as good as he gets was what appealed to ''Daily Show'' honchos about signing on Mr. Dole, who will be called on for commentary on the program's continuing coverage of pivotal campaign events. On the campaign trail, Mr. Dole's barbs sometimes came across as a little too sharp, but they are welcomed by Mr. Stewart and company. His hiring brings the phenomenon full circle: the politician as television entertainer about the political process.</p>
        <p>''My theory on Dole,'' Ms. Smithberg said, ''is that he's like the lawyer who is secretly a musician. Law is the job. And there are these other muscles he always wanted to flex.''</p>
