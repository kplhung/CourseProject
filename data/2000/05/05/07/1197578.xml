        <p>Will Abreu wants to make it big as a hip-hop artist, and to do so, he is more than willing to speak his mind. What has often been on his mind these days is police brutality, as is clear from his recent song on a mini-CD of the same name, ''Devils in a Blue Dress.''</p>
        <p>''I actually started working on this song three or four years ago,'' said  Mr. Abreu, who performs under the name Will Villainova. But in light of the Diallo verdict, he said, ''My manager, Steve Smith, heard it, and it was his idea to push it.''</p>

        <p>Will Abreu wants to make it big as a hip-hop artist, and to do so, he is more than willing to speak his mind. What has often been on his mind these days is police brutality, as is clear from his recent song on a mini-CD of the same name, ''Devils in a Blue Dress.''</p>
        <p>''I actually started working on this song three or four years ago,'' said  Mr. Abreu, who performs under the name Will Villainova. But in light of the Diallo verdict, he said, ''My manager, Steve Smith, heard it, and it was his idea to push it.''</p>
        <p>The song begins with radio news clips about the Diallo case. In the lyrics themselves, Mr. Abreu, 22, who lives with his mother in Inwood, remembers Anthony Baez, Mr. Diallo and others who were killed in encounters with the police.</p>
        <p>In a line indicative of the straightforward emotion Mr. Abreu brings to his recordings, he sings, ''I bet these lyrics have got the police really vexed, but to be damned by the devil is to be truly blessed.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Abreu said that his anger with the police extends beyond those famous cases. ''It's the harassment that me and people in this neighborhood are always the recipients of,'' he said, noting he had been stopped by the police several times. ''They approach you like you're a criminal, saying you fit a description, and then never apologize when they don't find anything.''</p>
        <p>Whether or not this view of the police is true, ''Devils in a Blue Dress'' has hit a chord with some people. The CD has sold nearly 3,000 copies, according to Mr. Smith, and it has had considerable air time on WBAI as well as some local college radio stations. Information on buying  the CD is available from DPI Music Group at (212) 714-3892.</p>
        <p>But breaking into mainstream radio with a political song may not be easy.</p>
        <p>''We've tried to get the song on Hot 97 and I'd love it if they played it, but I'm not surprised they haven't,'' said Mr. Abreu, referring to the city's main hip-hop station. ''I know that they usually don't play songs that deal with politics.''</p>
