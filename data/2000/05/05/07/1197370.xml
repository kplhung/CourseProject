        <p>To the Editor: Having just returned from a week at Phoenix Valley  Elderhostel, I really commiserated with Julia Duffy Ward (''On the Road to Reform -- The Traveler Within,'' March 12).</p>
        <p>I had carefully watched weather reports for weeks, calculating that by the time we arrived in Phoenix, the temperature would be in the upper 70's. I packed accordingly. Our arrival was accompanied by two and a half days of rain and temperatures in the 50's and 60's. When we left, the temperature hit 80. I never had a chance to wear the shorts or sleeveless tops I packed.</p>

        <p>When we went to Ireland last May, I took a heavy sweater and slicker -- wrong again. And when we went to Alaska, I never wore the insulated underwear and had to buy a T-shirt when it hit 75.</p>
        <p>I am beginning to feel like Charlie Brown going for the football and having it pulled away as I go to kick it.</p>
