        <p>After two years at 112 West 72nd Street (at Columbus Avenue), Hudson Dry Goods opened a second location at 873 Broadway (between 18th and 19th Streets) last month. Kimberlee Hanson, the buyer and a co-founder of the stores, said she and the proprietor, Richard Beyda, were ''working on finding the right location for over two years,'' and finally discovered a 14,000-square-foot space in an area of Manhattan she called  the ''mecca of home furnishing.''</p>

        <p>After two years at 112 West 72nd Street (at Columbus Avenue), Hudson Dry Goods opened a second location at 873 Broadway (between 18th and 19th Streets) last month. Kimberlee Hanson, the buyer and a co-founder of the stores, said she and the proprietor, Richard Beyda, were ''working on finding the right location for over two years,'' and finally discovered a 14,000-square-foot space in an area of Manhattan she called  the ''mecca of home furnishing.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Beyda is using the space for three to four times the amount of furnishings she offered in her original store. She arranges the three floors in sections that resemble rooms. There is a French kitchen, an area designated for pet products and a tall stand filled with unusual doorknobs. Much of the basement is ethnic furniture and artwork like antique Pakistani spice boxes ($40 to $200), African masks ($40 to $200) and rewired antique Egyptian chandeliers (about $1,300).</p>
