        <p>After reading the results of this poll, you'd have to say that lying to protect someone's feelings is as American as enriching your life by having children, almost as American as not ever having done yoga, and more American than thinking you are too fat or feeling guilty about a thing or two you did when you were younger. On the other hand, lying to protect someone's feelings is not nearly as American as thinking that being American is a big part of who you are.</p>
        <p>Myself, I would have to say that lying is not nearly as big a part of who I am as writing fiction, and in fact, I almost never lie, even to avoid hurting someone's feelings. What I do to avoid hurting someone's feelings is just keep my opinion to myself. Even so, my occasional forays into lying have made me something of a theorist of lying. (Here are the lies I told: 1. I sold a car knowing it needed new valve rings, but I really did not know that it needed a new transmission until the buyer told me about it five days after the sale. 2. I told one of my husbands that I still loved him even though I didn't know whether I did or not.)</p>

What I do to avoid hurting someone's feelings is just keep my opinion to myself. Even so, my occasional forays into lying have made me something of a theorist of lying. (Here are the lies I told: 1.

I told one of my husbands that I still loved him even though I didn't know whether I did or not.)</p>
        <p>There are several forms of what you might call lying. One is misrepresenting the truth. Another is keeping a secret. A third is presenting as true what you wish were true, or perhaps hope is true, but don't know for sure is true. A fourth form of lying is shorthand -- the truth is changing so quickly that to detail every shift would in fact present something as true that could very quickly become false. A fifth is being mistaken, which sometimes looks like a lie.</p>
        <p>Let's begin with being mistaken. Everyone is mistaken almost all the time, and so almost everything that everyone says will eventually be proved wrong, and so almost everything that everyone says is untrue. The best answer to any question is, ''I don't know,'' even to so simple a question as ''How do you like these shoes I bought?'' ''I don't know'' is a real commitment to the larger truth, because it recognizes that the passage of time makes every judgment provisional. However, people who always say ''I don't know'' find themselves in a double bind -- either they are considered too bland to have opinions or, if they explain why they don't know, they are told that they think too much, and thinking too much is not very American at all. So, logically, there is no truth telling, but people persuade themselves that they more or less tell the truth anyway.</p>
        <p>A recognition of complexity makes truth telling that much more difficult. Government officials or unfaithful spouses involved in some quickly developing crisis, for example, are often subsequently accused of either withholding information or misrepresenting the partial information already available. But the supposition that the truth is known almost always leads to action, and most actions, of course, turn out to be unreasoned, wrongheaded ones. Best to put off action as long as possible, and lying to achieve this goal is a perfectly wise decision.</p>
        <p>If the truth is almost always misrepresented, then the real moral distinctions with regard to lying have to do with motive. Most of those polled seem to feel that lying to save someone else pain is moral. I suspect, though, that they would have had a different response to the statement ''Lying is sometimes necessary to protect oneself.'' Let us say that 60 percent might have disagreed with this statement, and yet we all know that lying is sometimes necessary to protect oneself, even when we choose not to, and fail to protect ourselves. In fact, one of the main tasks of raising children is to convince them that telling a lie does not protect them; that it in fact endangers them even more than the misbehavior that gave rise to the lie. Children understand that to tell the truth is sometimes counterintuitive, which is why teaching them to tell the truth depends very much on how much power they think Mom and Dad really possess. In my experience, oldest children hardly ever lie, but second children, well aware of the disparity between what parents think is going on and what is really going on, lie rather easily.</p>
        <p>What constitutes self-protection? I wish the pollsters had asked a final question: ''Although this is an anonymous questionnaire, I have misrepresented the truth, exaggerated things and held information back on one or more questions. Do you agree or disagree?'' (See question No. 8, ''Have you ever cheated just a little on your taxes or an office expense account, or haven't you?'') Obviously, of the 84 percent who say they have never exaggerated their business mileage, never failed to report even a penny of cash income, never filled in the wrong amount on a blank taxi receipt, at least some are protecting their own opinion of themselves.</p>
        <p>And how about if the pollsters had asked the question, ''Lying is sometimes necessary for personal gain''? How American would it be to agree with that one? In what area of our booming economy do the sellers of goods advertise them truthfully? In what area do the buyers expect them to? In what political arena do the candidates come clean? In what political arena do the voters expect them to, or even want them to? I remember when President Carter's attempt to rescue the hostages in Iran failed. He spoke to the American people of his sense that the hostage taking posed something of a dilemma, not easily solved. As a result of his honesty and understanding of complexity, he was widely perceived as weak and summarily replaced in office by a simple man who seems never to have found himself in a dilemma.</p>
        <p>Is it more American to keep a secret or to tell it? The person doing the choosing often has to consider the motives of the person seeking the information. Almost all Americans, for example, would have considered it extremely un-American for those hiding Jews during World War II to divulge their whereabouts. In fact, many Americans would consider it highly American for those living under tyrannical regimes in faraway places to keep and bear arms, even unlawful, secret arms.</p>
        <p>My own feeling is that even in America, there are some to whom it is obligatory to lie. When you are going through a serious crisis, and a casual acquaintance or your mother asks how you are, it is a very bad idea to actually tell them. ''Fine'' is fine. It is also O.K. to lie to unsolicited telephone callers, guys who make passes and friends who like to retail gossip or offer unasked-for advice. In this category I would have to include the press too: there is never any moral opprobrium to be suffered by those who lie to the press. Reporters are in the business of selling secrets for money. They do not, therefore, have your best interests at heart. I have always admired the efforts of every single celebrity or politician who lied to the press. Just as the role of the press is to be a watchdog upon the government, the role of celebrities and politicians is to frustrate the all-seeing eye of the press and remind everyone that there are questions that should never be asked if a civil society is to be maintained.</p>
