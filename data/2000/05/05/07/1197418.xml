        <p>THE state government agreed last week to invest more than half a billion dollars in Adriaen's Landing, an ambitious plan to develop Hartford's waterfront that many people hope will ignite an economic revival in the state's struggling capital city.</p>
        <p>Hartford, which has the highest unemployment in the state and the lowest per capita income, is trying to capitalize on the experience of other cities such as Baltimore and Cleveland, which have worked to revitalize their downtowns through public investment in sports complexes, convention centers and retail districts.</p>
        <p>While the state's decision to put $529 million into this project has been lauded as a turning point for downtown Hartford, almost everyone involved with the project agreed that the long-term success of the project will require more than just sticking a new hotel and convention center into the downtown. Supporters hope the project will be a catalyst for further economic development and help turn around the city's image. For that to happen, however, the project must be successfully integrated into the surrounding city and coordinated with other urban revitalization projects.</p>
        <p>''This is not a magic bullet for the city,'' Representative David McClusky said. ''The city has a lot to prove. Not only does it have to get this project right so that it doesn't become another Constitution Plaza or Hartford Civic Center, it has to get its act together on other issues such as education and social services.''</p>
        <p>All together, Adriaen's Landing will cost an estimated $771 million culled from a combination of public and private sources. The state will raise most of its share from bonds. The project will include the construction of a convention center, a 700-room hotel, entertainment and retail space and upper-income housing targeted at young professionals on a 33-acre patch of land near the Hartford waterfront, as well as a $90 million football stadium in East Hartford for the University of Connecticut.</p>
        <p>The House of Representatives passed the bill authorizing state funding for the project on Tuesday and Gov. John G. Rowland, who has put his political weight behind Adriaen's Landing from the beginning, signed it into law less than an hour later.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rowland's rapid action on the funding bill is illustrative of the unusual coalition that has united behind this project. While the bill faced sharp criticism from some members, it passed easily in both the House and Senate with strong support from both parties.</p>
        <p>Public investment in projects like Adriaen's Landing, which are intended to draw people downtown and attract private investment, have become popular methods of urban renewal in cities that have been losing population and jobs to the suburbs.</p>
        <p>''These kinds of projects can be very symbolic and very important and significant in making those other kinds of investments take place,'' said John Melcher, associate state director at Michigan State University's Center for Urban Affairs Community and Economic Development Program. ''Downtowns by and large have had a traditional role of being the centers of commerce and financial centers for communities.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Melcher said a city's image could affect the reputation of the surrounding region, influencing investment decisions and people's decision to move into the area. Much of that image, he said, is based on the perceived vibrancy of the downtown area.</p>
        <p>Mr. Melcher cautioned, however, that downtown redevelopment projects must be accompanied by other initiatives to fix schools, support community organizations and provide affordable housing.</p>
        <p>''That isn't in and of itself a solution to many of the problems that face our urban cores,'' he said. ''Healthy downtowns and poor neighborhoods make you no more successful than healthy neighborhoods and poor downtowns.''</p>
        <p>Opponents of the project, who were few in number but vocal with their objections, question whether Adriaen's Landing is even a good place to start revitalizing Hartford. While the project may gentrify the city's center, they argued, it would leave the surrounding neighborhoods mired in poverty.</p>
        <p>''A project like this has never, ever, anywhere in the United States, been a catalyst for turning around a distressed city,'' said Representative Jefferson Davis, an opponent of the bill. ''We're going to find ourselves in five years with the convention center done and a city that is still segregated both economically and racially.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis said the Baltimore harbor project, which supporters of Adriaen's Landing and similar projects point to as a classic success redevelopment story, failed to help the poorest residents and improved only a few square miles of the city.</p>
        <p>David Rusk, a specialist on urban issues and author of ''Inside Games/Outside Games,'' said that the success of a project like Adriaen's Landing depends largely on whether one is looking at the downtown or the surrounding city. While Adriaen's Landing may turn the downtown into a tourist attraction and popular residential area for young professionals, he said he doubted that any positive economic effect would spill over into the surrounding neighborhoods. Hartford's biggest problems, he said, are its poverty and segregation.</p>
        <p>''This initiative is not going to affect that picture,'' Mr. Rusk said. ''That situation is the primary burden that the city of Hartford must deal with.''</p>
        <p>While Adriaen's Landing has attracted a great deal of attention, city and state officials said it is only one part of the Hartford revitalization effort.</p>
        <p>''Adriaen's Landing tends to get a lot of the attention because it's the biggest development project,'' said Dean Pagani, a spokesman for the governor. ''Millions of dollars have been spent in the neighborhood trying to create new business, trying to create safer hosing conditions near Trinity College. It's a process that is taking place throughout the city.''</p>
        <p>The Capital City Economic Development Authority, a quasi-public agency charged with overseeing Adriaen's Landing and other state-funded redevelopment projects in Hartford, is also working to bring more housing downtown, revitalize the ailing Hartford Civic Center, and bring more parking to the downtown area.</p>
        <p>The Riverfront Recapture Project has been working to reconnect the downtown to the water by creating a network of public recreation facilities.</p>
        <p>The success of Adriaen's Landing will depend largely on integrating these various projects and connecting them to the rest of the city through transportation and education initiatives, those involved in the project said.</p>
        <p>''This is only the end of the beginning,'' said Brendon Fox, executive director of the Capital City Economic Development Authority.</p>
