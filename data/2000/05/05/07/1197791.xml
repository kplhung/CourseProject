        <p>And Bear in Mind  (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>BEING DEAD, by Jim Crace. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $21.) Biology is applied to biologists in this implacably blunt and uncomfortable novel that begins with a dead couple, professors of zoology, then flashes back to see how they came so and forward to watch them decompose.</p>
        <p>BLONDE, by Joyce Carol Oates. (Ecco/ HarperCollins, $27.50.) A fat, messy, fierce and audacious novel that ventures to propose a plausible interior world for Marilyn Monroe.</p>
        <p>BLUE ANGEL, by Francine Prose. (HarperCollins, $25.) The sexes and the generations no longer speak in this high comic novel in which a middle-aged professor is the target of the student he supposes he is exploiting.</p>
        <p>THE COLLABORATOR: The Trial and Execution of Robert Brasillach, by Alice Kaplan. (University of Chicago, $25.) In her incisive account of the proceedings against Brasillach, who was probably the most accomplished literary cheerleader for Nazism that occupied France ever had, the author asks, When do words become crimes?</p>
        <p>IN THE FALL, by Jeffrey Lent. (Atlantic Monthly, $25.) Yes, a wounded soldier walks home from the Civil War at the start of this ambitious first novel, but the book soon emerges from the shadow of ''C--- M-------'' to chronicle the hero's marriage to a runaway slave and their family's disturbing legacy.</p>
        <p>LE MARIAGE, by Diane Johnson. (Dutton, $23.95.) A highly entertaining novel whose European-American couples misread each other not just as individuals but as cultural products; a manuscript is involved, also a murder, maybe a kidnapping.</p>
        <p>RAILS UNDER MY BACK, by Jeffery Renard Allen. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $26.) This restless, sprawling first novel, the story of two brothers married to two sisters, ranges over past and present, city and country, forebears and children to become, ultimately, a survey of the varieties of African-American experience.</p>
        <p>RAVELSTEIN, by Saul Bellow. (Viking, $24.95.) A lively, haunting novel that explores American male friendship as it pursues in parallel the last days and death of Bellow's friend Allan Bloom.</p>
        <p>WAY OUT THERE IN THE BLUE: Reagan, Star Wars and the End of the Cold War, by Frances FitzGerald. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $30.) An exhaustive account of America's fantastically expensive quest for a missile defense system and its failure to find one that even looks like working.</p>
        <p>WHITE TEETH, by Zadie Smith. (Random House, $24.95.) At 24, the author has the energy to tackle large questions of identity and assimilation in this sunny, irreverent debut novel, which follows the fortunes of two friends, one English, one Bengali, and their families in a tatty London suburb that is noisily, spicily and unabashedly multicultural.</p>

        <p>And Bear in Mind  (Editors' choices of other recent books of particular interest)</p>
        <p>BEING DEAD, by Jim Crace. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $21.) Biology is applied to biologists in this implacably blunt and uncomfortable novel that begins with a dead couple, professors of zoology, then flashes back to see how they came so and forward to watch them decompose.</p>
        <p>BLONDE, by Joyce Carol Oates. (Ecco/ HarperCollins, $27.50.) A fat, messy, fierce and audacious novel that ventures to propose a plausible interior world for Marilyn Monroe.</p>
        <p>BLUE ANGEL, by Francine Prose. (HarperCollins, $25.) The sexes and the generations no longer speak in this high comic novel in which a middle-aged professor is the target of the student he supposes he is exploiting.</p>
        <p>THE COLLABORATOR: The Trial and Execution of Robert Brasillach, by Alice Kaplan. (University of Chicago, $25.) In her incisive account of the proceedings against Brasillach, who was probably the most accomplished literary cheerleader for Nazism that occupied France ever had, the author asks, When do words become crimes?</p>
        <p>IN THE FALL, by Jeffrey Lent. (Atlantic Monthly, $25.) Yes, a wounded soldier walks home from the Civil War at the start of this ambitious first novel, but the book soon emerges from the shadow of ''C--- M-------'' to chronicle the hero's marriage to a runaway slave and their family's disturbing legacy.</p>
        <p>LE MARIAGE, by Diane Johnson. (Dutton, $23.95.) A highly entertaining novel whose European-American couples misread each other not just as individuals but as cultural products; a manuscript is involved, also a murder, maybe a kidnapping.</p>
        <p>RAILS UNDER MY BACK, by Jeffery Renard Allen. (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $26.) This restless, sprawling first novel, the story of two brothers married to two sisters, ranges over past and present, city and country, forebears and children to become, ultimately, a survey of the varieties of African-American experience.</p>
        <p>RAVELSTEIN, by Saul Bellow. (Viking, $24.95.) A lively, haunting novel that explores American male friendship as it pursues in parallel the last days and death of Bellow's friend Allan Bloom.</p>
        <p>WAY OUT THERE IN THE BLUE: Reagan, Star Wars and the End of the Cold War, by Frances FitzGerald. (Simon &amp; Schuster, $30.) An exhaustive account of America's fantastically expensive quest for a missile defense system and its failure to find one that even looks like working.</p>
        <p>WHITE TEETH, by Zadie Smith. (Random House, $24.95.) At 24, the author has the energy to tackle large questions of identity and assimilation in this sunny, irreverent debut novel, which follows the fortunes of two friends, one English, one Bengali, and their families in a tatty London suburb that is noisily, spicily and unabashedly multicultural.</p>
