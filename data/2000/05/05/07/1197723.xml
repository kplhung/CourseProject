        <p>PBS plans to broadcast program in series, Secrets of the Dead, which challenges conclusion that lightning or static electricity ignited leaking hydrogen, causing fiery explosion aboard Hindenburg at Lakehurst, NJ, which killed 66 people; photo (By the Way column) (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>''The humanity!'' So goes the familiar radio lament from an announcer witnessing the explosion of the Hindenburg at Lakehurst, 63 years ago yesterday, which killed 66. Equally familiar is the conclusion that leaking hydrogen was ignited by lightning or static electricity. But on May 17 at 8 p.m., PBS will broadcast one in a series provocatively called ''Secrets of the Dead,'' which changes the story. It introduces a retired NASA scientist named Addison Bain, an advocate of hydrogen fuel, who notes that the ball of flame was red; hydrogen burns blue. He conducts research, finds a piece of the blimp's cloth cover, performs tests and concludes it was that cover, coated with powdered aluminum and iron oxide (the ingredients in rocket fuel), that caught fire. Besides being a gripping scientific detective tale, the episode is a reminder of the days when airships provided a combination of speed and luxury, something like a cross between the Titanic and the Concorde, and a landing at Lakehurst was something to behold, until May 17, 1937.</p>
