        <p>Ohio attorney general plans appeal to US Supreme Court if necessary of recent ruling by federal appeals court that official state motto, 'With God all things are possible,' violates religious freedom clause of US Constitution; is being urged to reconsider by some state senators, who argue less costly and time-consuming tactic should be used--of substituting phrase 'In God We Trust,' which is found on all US currency; photo (S)</p>

        <p>For 41 years, Ohio's official state motto was ''With God, all things are possible.'' Then, two weeks ago, a three-judge federal appeals panel ruled that the motto violated the religious freedom clause of the Constitution because it was drawn from a statement by Jesus in Matthew 19:26.</p>

        <p>For 41 years, Ohio's official state motto was ''With God, all things are possible.'' Then, two weeks ago, a three-judge federal appeals panel ruled that the motto violated the religious freedom clause of the Constitution because it was drawn from a statement by Jesus in Matthew 19:26.</p>
        <p>What to do?</p>
        <p>The state attorney general plans an appeal, all the way to the United States Supreme Court if necessary, a step endorsed last week by the Ohio Senate. But two senators, Ben E. Espy of Columbus and Leigh E. Herington of Revenna, both Democrats, are urging their colleagues and the attorney general to reconsider.</p>
        <p>They say they have a better, far less costly and time-consuming idea: Adopt the phrase now found on United States money, ''In God We Trust.''</p>
        <p>That one, they contend, is already the official United States motto and therefore a sure legal winner.</p>
