        <p>FOR years a derelict garage was all that stood on the 4.8 acre-site along the Palisades cliffs here, a symbol of a stalled condominium development from the late 1980's.</p>
        <p>''It basically had become an eyesore,''  said Fort Lee's mayor, Jack Alter. The site is one of the last large developable parcels in Fort Lee.</p>
        <p>But new owners bought the site 18 months ago, with plans to turn it into a $100 million rental complex called the Palisades. It will have 438 apartments in a 29-story L-shaped  building, 80 apartments in a separate 12-story building that also houses a garage, with 20 town houses on its roof. Nearly all of the one- to three-bedroom units will have views of the George Washington Bridge, a quarter of a mile to the north, as well as of the river and the Manhattan skyline beyond.</p>
        <p>The garage will accommodate 1,000 cars, and it will be crowned by a 1.4-acre landscaped plaza. The site is bounded by River Road, Parker Avenue, Old Palisades Road and Massa Lane.</p>
        <p>The Palisades is being developed by the Applied Development Company of Hoboken, with Vornado Realty Trust of Saddle Brook as its financial partner. In addition to the partners' own equity, financing is coming from a consortium of five banks.</p>
        <p>Allen F. Goldman, a senior vice president of Applied, said his company was undeterred by the site's development history.</p>
        <p>''There is no doubt about the strength of the housing market in Bergen County in general and in Fort Lee in particular,'' Mr. Goldman said. ''Every major condo and co-op building in the borough is filled, and there is an equally strong demand for rentals.''</p>
        <p>The project, which is expected to be completed in 18 months, will be the second large new rental complex in Fort Lee. The 351-unit Avalon Crest opened in late 1998. Its seven four-story buildings are fully occupied, said Gary Steinfield, the vice president for development at the Princeton office of AvalonBay, the developer.</p>
        <p>Together, Avalon Crest and the Palisades are the first new rental developments to rise in the 2.5-square-mile borough of Fort Lee in 25 years.</p>
        <p>Beginning in the late 80's, the site of the Palisades was involved in a tangle of litigation, which ended last year. Applied bought the site in July 1998 from a developer that  never proceeded with its its plan to build condominiums.</p>
        <p>That developer, Haseko (New York Inc.),  owned by the Haseko Corporation of Tokyo,  and the borough hammered out an agreement in 1994 after seven years of litigation over the number of units to be built on the site and where. To avoid blocking other buildings' views, the new tower, designed by Costas Kondylis, the Manhattan architect, will rise on the northern corner of the site. Mr. Kondylis had also designed the unrealized condo project but has revised the interior to create larger apartments for the Palisades.</p>
        <p>Applied is to follow the terms of the agreement, which was the result of a lawsuit filed by Haseko against Fort Lee in 1987. Haseko contended that the borough's zoning violated the State Supreme Court's Mount Laurel doctrines, which require municipal zoning to include sites for housing for people of all incomes. By the time Applied entered the scene, that agreement had been the subject of two subsequent lawsuits.</p>
        <p>The first suit went all the way to State Supreme Court, and it was decided in favor of the development. A similar suit in Superior Court, contending that the challenge to  the rezoning of the site to permit a residential tower had been improperly dismissed,  ended in an out-of-court settlement last year, said Mr. Goldman of Applied. The project received final site plan approval from the borough in January.</p>
        <p>AS part of the 1994 agreement, Applied contributed $800,000 to the borough and will also build 60 rental apartments in a separate building for tenants with low and moderate incomes, up to $69,504 a year. Construction of that five-story building on Kaufer Lane, about three blocks north of the Palisades project, must meet a timetable set out in the agreement or Applied will be subject to fines.</p>
        <p>Looking back, Mayor Alter said: ''This project is something we agreed to and will not affect the neighboring buildings, preserving their views and presumably their values.''</p>
        <p>Of its impact on schools and traffic, he said, ''You can't legislate against school-age children.''</p>
        <p>Peggy Thomas, the borough's administrator, said, ''Only time will tell the ultimate impact.''</p>
        <p>Certainly, the development will bring more cars. But Mayor Alter said that traffic in the borough, which he called the state's most heavily traveled community, is a persistent problem because of the bridge.</p>
        <p>The Palisades is indicative of the renewed interest in building rental apartments in the state, where such construction has inched upward since 1995. Of the 36,600 housing permits issued in the state last year, 5,915 were for rental units, according to preliminary state figures. In 1995 there were 28,895 permits issued, of which 3,483 were for rentals.</p>
        <p>Evidence of that increase is the spate of rental towers that are, or soon will be, sprouting along New Jersey's 18 miles of  Hudson River shoreline, anchored in the north by Fort Lee.</p>
        <p>''Despite the new construction, the rental market has tightened up big time,'' said Nathan Slovin, the executive vice president of the New Jersey Apartment Association,  in East Brunswick. The statewide vacancy rate is under 5 percent, he said.</p>
        <p>With New Jersey's economy strong and new businesses, and employees, coming into  the state, he estimates there is a shortfall of  about 10,000 rental units. The most acute shortage is rentals ''for regular working people,'' Mr. Slovin said, noting that the scarcity and high cost of properly zoned land, as well as increasing construction costs, are pushing rents for new apartments  into the luxury category.</p>
        <p>Also spurring the demand for rentals is the ripple effect from Manhattan, where soaring rents are prompting some tenants  to turn to close-in and less expensive New Jersey locations, like Fort Lee and other riverfront towns.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldman of Applied, an active riverfront developer, offered another reason. Some people are looking for ''more flexibility in their lives and have no desire to commit to purchasing housing,'' he said. All those reasons and the fact ''that there is virtually no rental housing in Fort Lee,'' he said, convinced him to proceed with the Palisades project.</p>
        <p>The borough's rental supply is puny: of its 15,000 housing units, only about 2,300 are rentals. In the conversion frenzy of the late 70's and early 80's, 41 rental apartment buildings were converted to co-ops or condos.</p>
        <p>Charles Oppler, a partner in Oppler-Ketive Realtors in Fort Lee, said that a high-rise luxury rental, with views, services and amenities, ''could fill a niche'' in the market.</p>
        <p>At the Palisades the apartments will have 900 to 1,900 square feet of space and such features as marble-tile baths, washers and dryers and large windows to take advantage of the views, Mr. Goldman said. The tower will have a facade of red, orange and beige brick, and along with the garage and landscaped plaza, other amenities will include a children's playroom, a health club and a library.</p>
        <p>Monthly rents have not been set, but Mr. Goldman said that if the building were completed today, apartments would rent for $30 a square foot on average. That would come to $2,250 a month for a 900-square-foot one-bedroom and $4,750 for a 1,900-square-foot three-bedroom.</p>
        <p>Mr. Oppler said those rents would be 10  percent higher than those for existing rental apartments in the area. ''What the developers are counting on,'' he said, ''is that their project is the only game in town.''</p>
