        <p>THE village government here is close to an agreement to lease land at Harbor Island Park to a private sports-contracting company for a year-round multi-sport complex.</p>
        <p>The contractor, a Long Island company called Sportime, would spend an estimated $1.9 million on the project and would pay the village $225,000 in rent the first year and $4.5 million over the life of the contract.</p>
        <p>Critics have charged that the plans were developed with virtually no public input, and they question the wisdom of turning over public land to a private company.</p>
        <p>The Village Board is expected to act on the proposal at a meeting tomorrow at 8 P.M. at the Village Hall on Prospect Avenue.</p>
        <p>Currently, the eight clay tennis courts at the park are open to the public from May to October. The rest of the year, the courts are leased to the Harbor View Racquet Club, owned by Peter Kaplan of Bedford, and are covered by two large bubbles. Mr. Kaplan charges the public to use the courts.</p>
        <p>Under the new plan, the tennis courts, along with a new multi-sport complex that could be used for roller hockey, soccer, basketball and tennis, would be operated year round by a private company, which would charge membership fees. In the winter three large bubbles would cover the facilities.</p>
        <p>The lease would be for 17 years, and Sportime would also build a clubhouse at its own expense.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaplan, who has operated the Harbor View Racquet Club since 1983, said he feels betrayed.</p>
        <p>He said he first approached the village in 1995 about building a multi-sport complex, adding that his plans were virtually identical to those offered by Sportime.</p>
        <p>Mayor Deborah Chapin, who took office six months ago with the project already on her desk, believes Harbor Island has long been underused.</p>
        <p>''We will be looking at a significant upgrade of facilities and major capital,'' she said. ''This new facility will bring all sorts of different people down to the park.''</p>
        <p>The village manager, Michael S. Blau, also defended the plan.</p>
        <p>''The private sector can do a facility like this better than the public sector,'' he said, ''and if we can enter into a partnership that serves everyone's goals, why not?''</p>
        <p>But Dom Trifiletti, a tennis pro who has directed the village's tennis recreational program at the park for 20 years, said he was upset that the village was turning summer public courts into a private, members-only club.</p>
        <p>''It shouldn't be privatized,'' he said. ''They're taking a gem of a facility and putting it in a stranger's hands.''</p>
        <p>And others questioned the lack of public discussion about the plans.</p>
        <p>''I think it's very strange that all this has been done quietly,'' said Richard L. Ottinger, a former Congressman and dean emeritus of Pace University's Law School, who is a resident and tennis player here. ''I haven't seen anything about it in the papers at all. They're doing the public business. They're leasing public land. They might want to let people know what's going on.''</p>
        <p>But Mayor Chapin said: ''I don't think there's been a lack of disclosure. A licensing agreement doesn't require public hearings.''</p>
        <p>The village will receive $225,000 in rent from Sportime in the first year of the contract, said Mort Heilman, who was on the committee formed to select a company to build and operate the complex. Mr. Kaplan paid between $70,000 and $80,000 to the village in the last year of his contract, Mr. Heilman said.</p>
        <p>He said negotiations were delayed because town officials wanted Sportime to charge lower summer rates.</p>
        <p>Claude Okin, the owner of Sportime, said: ''The village has been very concerned to keep the facility open to the residential public. There will be a very small increase in membership dues the first summer, and then it'll scale up over time.''</p>
        <p>The eight clay tennis courts will be replaced by courts with a fast-drying surface.</p>
        <p>Mr. Okin said that membership to gain access to the multi-sport facilities will be $7 a month for village residents and $9 a month for nonresidents.</p>
        <p>Additional fees will be charged for playing different sports, he said.</p>
