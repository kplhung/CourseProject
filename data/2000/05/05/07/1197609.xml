        <p>HERE is the problem in theory: A good job on the night shift opens up. A mother with several children is not offered the job, which would be a promotion, because her supervisor assumes -- wrongly -- that her family responsibilities prevent her from working nights.</p>
        <p>Did the supervisor act properly?</p>
        <p>Hardly anyone would say so. Certainly the mother is the only one who knows whether she is able to work nights.</p>
        <p>Should the supervisor's action be against the law?</p>
        <p>Absolutely, in President Clinton's view.</p>
        <p>Is the problem pervasive?</p>
        <p>No one knows for sure.</p>
        <p>It is the kind of problem the president loves to address -- the way he has promoted school uniforms to improve classroom discipline and V-chips to block violent programs on television.</p>
        <p>His solutions cost little. They endear him to his admirers. And his political foes often seem to have been outsmarted.</p>
        <p>So last week, with a stroke of his pen, Mr. Clinton ordered an end to discrimination against federal workers because they are parents.</p>
        <p>''Believe it or not, there are still some employers who are reluctant to hire or to promote employees who have children at home,'' he said.</p>
        <p>His order, he said, sent this message: ''No glass ceiling for parents. The job they are doing at home is more important anyway, and if they can do your job, you ought not to stop them.''</p>
        <p>The key phrase is ''if they can do your job.''</p>
        <p>No one would argue seriously, for example, that because an employee cannot work nights, the government should be required by law to create a day-side promotion.</p>
        <p>A more difficult question is what happens when two people are in competition for employment or a promotion -- a single person who can work long hours and a parent who cannot afford to. Is it discrimination if the long hours are rewarded? Or is it discrimination if they are not?</p>
        <p>The practical effect of the executive order on those kinds of common situations is far from clear. The White House could not offer a single case of discrimination in the past that the president's executive order would now prohibit.</p>
        <p>Neither could the federal workers' union, the American Federation of Government Employees.</p>
        <p>Russ Binion, the president of Local 12, to which Labor Department employees belong, said, ''I know people don't get assignments because they have kids, but I can't give you a specific one.''</p>
        <p>The staff member who developed the policy, Bruce Reed, the president's chief domestic policy adviser, conceded that he did not know whether this kind of bias was a problem in the government.</p>
        <p>''We hope that this is not a widespread practice,'' Mr. Reed said, ''but we'd like to be on the safe side.''</p>
        <p>The executive order was welcomed in some circles as a symbol.</p>
        <p>''It's a very good thing the president did, because it's a marker,'' said Judith L. Lichtman, president of the National Partnership for Women and Families, a liberal advocacy group. ''This is how you get the conversation to change about what is acceptable and unacceptable behavior.''</p>
        <p>But as so often happens here, the president's political opponents were infuriated. It would be hard to overestimate the rage Bill Clinton ignites in some quarters nowadays, even over an executive order that may have no effect whatsoever.</p>
        <p>The response from Representative J. C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, chairman of the House Republican Conference, was typical:</p>
        <p>''This is the latest meaningless proposal from an administration desperately searching for a legacy that will endure after the evening news ends. Having already claimed credit for solving every problem under the sun, the Clinton-Gore team has apparently taken to espousing solutions in search of new problems.''</p>
        <p>President Clinton first broached the issue in his State of the Union Message last year. As part of a long list of proposals involving children and families, he declared:</p>
        <p>''I want to ask Congress to prohibit companies from refusing to hire or promote workers simply because they have children. That is not right.''</p>
        <p>On the president's behalf, Senators Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts and Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, both Democrats, introduced legislation last year that would have prohibited discrimination against parents by all employers. The bill went nowhere.</p>
        <p>So, unable to win support for a national policy, the president issued the executive order, which applies only to federal workers.</p>
        <p>Its range is narrow.</p>
        <p>Parents would not be guaranteed any jobs. Someone who could not work long hours because of family obligations would not have to be offered a position that required overtime. A worker who was not always free to travel could not expect a position that often required last-minute trips. A supervisor would be free to discipline an employee who was often late because child-care fell through.</p>
        <p>It is harder to ascertain what the order would do than what it would not do. White House officials made clear that the order sets a goal and does not give anyone the right to sue the government.</p>
        <p>The measure would certainly not alleviate the stress many parents face balancing the responsibilities of work and family.</p>
        <p>It would not seem to help, for instance, a clerk at the Labor Department, a single mother who asked when she was interviewed last week that her name not be used, who said she was sure she had been denied a promotion recently because of her family obligations. When pressed, she acknowledged that she had fallen behind in her work because she had taken so much unpaid leave to deal with a daughter's illness.</p>
        <p>IT wouldn't interfere in any way,'' said Joe Lockhart, the president's press secretary, ''with an employer's ability to reject workers who aren't able to perform a job in question. It would simply ensure that workers aren't discriminated against on the basis of being a parent.''</p>
        <p>The problem may be that this kind of discrimination is simply too subtle to prove.</p>
