        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Elizabeth Gardner was an American, born in New Hampshire, not an Englishwoman as John Russell wrote in his article about the exhibition ''Overcoming All Obstacles: The Women of the Academie Julian'' at the Dahesh Museum [''For Women, a Clean, Well-Lighted Place to Paint,'' April 23]. She arrived in Paris in the summer of 1864 to further her art studies, spending hours copying at the Louvre, then in 1865 was part of a women's cooperative studio. From 1868 on she entered paintings in the annual Salons and was accepted. In 1873, at age 36, after living and studying in Paris for nine years, she applied to the police for a permit to wear male attire in order to have access to drawing classes for men at the government-run Gobelin tapestry school. In 1879 she became engaged (at age 42) to her next-door neighbor and favored critic, Adolphe-William Bouguereau. The engagement lasted for 17 years before they were married; all the while she continued her academic paintings and won awards from the Salon.</p>

        <p>Elizabeth Gardner was much more than a mere teacher's wife, she was a very gutsy woman.</p>
