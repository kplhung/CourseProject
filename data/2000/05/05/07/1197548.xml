        <p>Jerry Friedman can remember when the stretch of Broadway near 231st Street was a bustling thoroughfare and its small-store owners enjoyed booming business.</p>
        <p>But in recent years competition from malls, notably in nearby Yonkers, along with changing shopping habits and escalating rents have combined to make business tough for mom-and-pop shops.</p>
        <p>''Things just aren't what they used to be,'' said Jerry Friedman, who has been selling his wares at Cedar Dale Army and Navy, on 231st Street, since 1976. ''People rather go to the big guys today.''</p>
        <p>But the cavalry may be on the way. In an effort to give area businesses a needed boost, some local leaders have proposed creating a business improvement district. If established, the Kingsbridge BID would stretch along Broadway from 230th Street to 236th Street and along 231st Street from the Major Deegan Expressway to Corlear Avenue.</p>
        <p>The BID would become the borough's fourth. Two others, on Fordham Road and Arthur Avenue, are also in the works, according to Tracy McDermott, a spokeswoman for the Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation.</p>
        <p>The BID would collect fees from the area's 65 property owners and use a $235,000 annual budget to spruce up the area and help promote it as a viable shopping district. Improvements would range from expanded street cleaning to installing new lampposts and garbage cans to paying for a security force.</p>
        <p>''This is something that will really make a difference,'' said Janet Golovner, the woman who conceived of the idea and will head up the new effort. ''With a steady revenue stream, this will give the businesses here a boost.''</p>
        <p>While most local property owners support the idea, as do the local community board and elected officials, the feeling is not unanimous. Neither Loehmann's nor Staples, the area's two major retailers, have signed on to the proposal. And for some of the mom-and-pop store owners, the fees aren't worth it.</p>
        <p>''It's a dream,'' said Helma Tishman, the owner of Dor-Lon Karpet on 231st Street. ''People in the neighborhood leave their trash around. The BID won't change that.''</p>
        <p>Despite their reservations, the approval process is underway, and Ms. Golovner hopes the project will be complete early next year.</p>
