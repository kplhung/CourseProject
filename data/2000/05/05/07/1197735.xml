        <p>Comment on current efforts of Pro Life Caucus in Pennsylvania Legislature to strip $4.3 million for family planning from state budget at time when Republican Gov Tom Ridge, who favors abortion rights, is being mentioned as possibile vice presidential candidate; photo (S)</p>

        <p>Speculation has been especially intense since Gov. George W. Bush of Texas raised the possibility that he might choose Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania as a running mate. Not only does Mr. Ridge hail from an important battleground state with 23 electoral votes, but he also happens to be a close friend.</p>
        <p>Still, whenever Governor Ridge's name comes up, the point is almost always made that unlike Governor Bush, Governor Ridge favors abortion rights, hardly something that will endear him to the powerful Republican right. No matter, Governor Bush has said time and again, his friend merits consideration as a top prospect.</p>

        <p>Speculation has been especially intense since Gov. George W. Bush of Texas raised the possibility that he might choose Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania as a running mate. Not only does Mr. Ridge hail from an important battleground state with 23 electoral votes, but he also happens to be a close friend.</p>
        <p>Still, whenever Governor Ridge's name comes up, the point is almost always made that unlike Governor Bush, Governor Ridge favors abortion rights, hardly something that will endear him to the powerful Republican right. No matter, Governor Bush has said time and again, his friend merits consideration as a top prospect.</p>
        <p>Governor Ridge's critics think otherwise, and they seem bent on driving their point home.</p>
        <p>At a time when Mr. Ridge surely would prefer to be viewed as a governor who has cut taxes, improved schools, reformed welfare and cleaned up the environment, the Pro-Life Caucus in the Pennsylvania legislature is pushing hard to strip $4.3 million for family planning out of the state budget, arguing that the money is ''contributing to the abortion process.'' Mr. Ridge wants to keep the money in and, if the past is prologue, he will fight.</p>
        <p>When the issue came up in 1995, he managed to outmaneuver the caucus, even though a majority of the legislature is anti-abortion. And in 1996, he worked a compromise, retaining state money for use for family planning in general but agreeing that none would be used for abortions or abortion counseling.</p>
        <p>The head of the Pro-Life Caucus, State Representative Jerry Birmelin, a Republican from Pike County in the northeast corner of the state, says that while the governor might prefer that the funds issue not be on the legislative agenda at this point in the presidential campaign, the timing had nothing to do with him. ''Not my goal,'' Mr. Birmelin said the other day. ''It's not centered on him or anything he's doing.''</p>
