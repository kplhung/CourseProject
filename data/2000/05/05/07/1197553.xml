        <p>I STARTED wearing Chanel No. 5 because of Catherine Deneuve. To my teenage eyes she was the epitome of French style and classic beauty, and I figured that if I wore it, too -- bell-bottoms aside -- I would somehow acquire that same je ne sais quoi. In Scarsdale.</p>
        <p>I had my dalliances along the way. There was Charlie (Shelly Hack's appeal was somehow not eternal) and Chloe, even Fracas for a minute, but in the end it was always Chanel. Those dreaded women at Bloomingdale's who aim their atomizers and fire get nowhere with me.</p>

        <p>I STARTED wearing Chanel No. 5 because of Catherine Deneuve. To my teenage eyes she was the epitome of French style and classic beauty, and I figured that if I wore it, too -- bell-bottoms aside -- I would somehow acquire that same je ne sais quoi. In Scarsdale.</p>
        <p>I had my dalliances along the way. There was Charlie (Shelly Hack's appeal was somehow not eternal) and Chloe, even Fracas for a minute, but in the end it was always Chanel. Those dreaded women at Bloomingdale's who aim their atomizers and fire get nowhere with me.</p>
        <p>But after 25 years, even I was bored, so when I read that Sarah Horowitz was taking appointments for her Fragrance Journey, I called. ''The fragrance equivalent of rebirthing,'' the notice read, ''Horowitz coaxes forth scent-related memories and then blends you a scent with emotional meaning.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Horowitz is based in Malibu, but she road-trips regularly to New York and London; it turns out she has 1,200 clients. Though it sounded kind of kooky, I found the prospect somehow intriguing -- like having a shrink and a personal shopper rolled into one.</p>
        <p>While customization has proved popular recently in everything from suits to ice cream, it is taking off in the top tiers of the fragrance industry. Creed, the very upscale European fragrance house, whose perfumer is the sixth-generation Oliver Creed, offers custom scents ($20,000 for Mr. Creed himself to oversee a process that takes six months). There are also Creed master blenders at Barneys New York, Bergdorf Goodman and Neiman Marcus, who can blend five or six of the existing 100 Creed scents for customers in an hour, for the more affordable fee of $400 to $1,000.</p>
        <p>On the West Coast there are a growing number of fragrance boutiques like Lather in Pasadena and Homebody in Los Angeles that blend custom scents for clients like K. D. Lang. As Mary Lavo, the merchandising manager in charge of cosmetics for Barneys, says, the custom-scent trend is not sweeping huge numbers because of the time (and money) the process requires -- like couture versus ready-to-wear. Historically, fragrance was an exclusive privilege of royalty and the very rich, until the late 1800's, when the common folk got in on the act. So, it's not surprising that with the economy soaring now, the very rich have once again realized they no longer have to smell like even the moderately rich.</p>
        <p>While the custom-scent trend has not broken through to the masses, some online sites plan to offer the service to users, via questionnaire. (Reflect.com was the only one I found promising that personalized scents ''will be available soon.'') Ms. Horowitz and some other professionals in the fragrance business are skeptical of this sort of venture, however, since body chemistry plays such an important part in determining a scent.</p>
        <p>She settled down to determine mine in my apartment, breaking her ''no house calls rule,'' because her New York schedule was so jammed she could see me only on her day off. (She usually sets up shop in a hotel suite; appointments can be made by calling 310-317-6858.)</p>
        <p>The Fragrance Journey costs $255 for a 90-minute session and includes a quarter-ounce French-cut bottle of the perfume she creates with you. (Perfect Perfumes, her ready-to-wear line, as she calls it, is sold in New York at the Bigelow Pharmacy in Greenwich Village.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Horowitz travels with a fragrance organ, a large case containing 120 bottles of fragrances and essential oils. As she set up her apparatus and put some New Age music on the tape player, I learned that she grew up on Long Island and graduated from Emerson College in Boston, where she discovered her interest in scent while working for Essence, a store on Newbury Street, now defunct. She has apprenticed at Belmay, a perfume house in the Los Angeles area, and has spent the last 12 years combining her love of scent with her love of psychology.</p>
        <p>''My passion is to incorporate emotional and physical history into the blending of fragrance,'' she said. ''I love listening to people and seeing what we can put together.'' The results have included everything from separate daytime and nighttime scents to a custom-made bridal scent that the bridegroom doesn't smell until the wedding day. ''After that, you only wear it on anniversaries or special occasions,'' she said. ''It's Pavlovian. You're impregnating the oil with your memory.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Horowitz started the session by telling me, ''You will have to name the fragrance you give to yourself,'' which she would then print up on labels for my future orders. She has a lab assistant who translates her handwritten formulas into sprays, bath gels and body lotions.</p>
        <p>She gave a brief history of fragrance, noting that the Egyptians made cones out of beeswax and tallow, laid blossoms on them and wore them on their heads. As the heat of the sun melted them, the scented fat ran down their faces. Yum yum.</p>
        <p>''This is one of the oldest art forms,'' she said. ''You are receiving the highest gift you can give yourself, a fragrance based on your experiences and what you love.''</p>
        <p>Then her questions started. What were my favorite foods? Favorite color? What were my scent memories of my mother? Do I love citrus? Not especially. How about sweet? Even less.</p>
        <p>Yes, I do like the ocean, better than the mountains. I like roses and grass and violets. I especially like the way some people smell like soap, so clean and straight from the shower.</p>
        <p>As I spoke, she pulled bottles from her case and grouped them on the table, moving them around as if they were chess pieces. She gave me a Parmesan cheese shaker filled with coffee beans and instructed me to inhale periodically; it works as a palate cleanser for the nose.</p>
        <p>''Perfume is built like music is,'' she said. ''The base note, middle and top. The base supports the scent, like the percussion, the middle is the bouquet of fragrance and the top note is the most pungent and pulls you into the rest. It's like the strings.''</p>
        <p>During the first round of inhaling her bottles, she told me what each scent was and had me tell her whether I loved it, hated it or wasn't sure. What followed was a series of childhood memories, instantaneous snapshots of the oddest assortment of people and places: my Aunt Marcia's bathroom, the soap in my underwear drawer in junior high school, a hotel room in Puerto Rico.</p>
        <p>Sweet pea smelled like camp. Cassis smelled like Chanel No. 5. Basil smelled like dinner and didn't interest me at all. As a matter of fact, I disliked most scents.</p>
        <p>''There's no wrong answer here,'' Ms. Horowitz said encouragingly. ''It's all about you, and I know how to balance it.''</p>
        <p>During the second round of inhaling she instructed me to keep my eyes closed. ''When they're open you have a mental association with what you perceive the scent to be,'' she said. ''With your eyes closed, you go on your gut. I watch your facial expressions and see where the emphasis should be when I blend.''</p>
        <p>I ended up with six ingredients for her to mix with her long plastic eyedroppers: Oriental musk, rose, sweet pea, African violet, gardenia and cassis. ''It has a garden feel, and the cassis makes it very sophisticated,'' she said, putting it on my arm. I smelled it and winced. It was way too sweet.</p>
        <p>She nodded. ''Your skin brings the rose up,'' she said. ''It depends on body chemistry. Certain people pull up certain notes faster.''</p>
        <p>She kept adjusting, adding one drop at a time from skinnier glass eyedroppers to different areas of my arms and hands. She ran her nose up and down the skin, sniffing, like a puppy. I started to feel that my choices were wrong, but she kept mixing until suddenly I smiled. Yes.</p>
        <p>''It reminds me of something,'' I told her. ''Something good.''</p>
        <p>She smiled. ''You,'' she said.</p>
        <p>After she had packed up and gone, I showered, dressed and put on my new perfume, as I did the day after and the day after that. I tried not to notice, but it was still too sweet. The spray she had made was better, less concentrated, but still not right. One night I went back to Chanel No. 5, which surprisingly, smelled thin and chemical by comparison.</p>
        <p>I called Ms. Horowitz. ''This happens about 10 percent of the time,'' she said apologetically. ''My goal is to have you love this, so I'm going to rework it based on the formula and send you some samples in the mail.''</p>
        <p>She wasn't completely surprised by my reaction, she added. ''My impressions of you,'' she said, ''were that you are extremely thorough and very specific. Yet, there is a little contradiction. You said you didn't like sweet things, but when you smelled them, you liked them.''</p>
        <p>She hesitated. ''If you don't mind my saying so, you do a lot of thinking in your line of work and I think you don't want to be perceived as too sweet.''</p>
        <p>She was probably right. But she had overcompensated for me a bit too much.</p>
        <p>After I hung up, I realized I still hadn't named my scent. I could wait, of course, until the revised version came back. But one night, at the movies, the name came to me. I had caught a whiff of myself, and it was fragrant, familiar, even comforting. Not to mention decidedly imperfect.</p>
        <p>''Mine.''</p>
