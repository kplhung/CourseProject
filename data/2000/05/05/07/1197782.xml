        <p>Carlos Franco and Blaine McCallister have plenty of company at the top of the crowded leaderboard in the Compaq Classic in New Orleans.</p>
        <p>While Franco and McCallister shot four-under-par 68's yesterday to share the third-round lead, 14 players are within five strokes of the leaders.</p>
        <p>''This is the kind of golf course where somebody from the back of the pack can shoot a 64 or 65 at any time,'' McCallister said. ''If you're sitting there trying to protect your lead, all of a sudden you can look up and they've gone past you.''</p>
        <p>Harrison Frazar was a stroke back after a 64 and nine players were within four strokes of the lead.</p>
        <p>Franco, from Paraguay, has found the Compaq course very friendly, shooting in the 60's in seven rounds over two tournaments.</p>
        <p>''It seems almost like my home course,'' he said. ''The sort of holes and it's very hot, especially when the wind doesn't blow.''</p>
        <p>GREEN LEADS BY 2: Hubert Green set the Home Depot Invitational record with a nine-under 63 yesterday, charging from back in the pack to take a two-shot lead over the defending champion Bruce Fleisher.</p>
        <p>Green took advantage of ideal conditions and true greens on the TPC Piper Glen course in Charlotte, N.C., carding 10 birdies and one bogey to break the record set by J.C. Snead in the final round in 1993.</p>
        <p>The 53-year-old Green, who won two majors on the PGA Tour, had an 11-under 133 to break the tournament's 36-hole mark of 134 set by Bob Murphy in 1995 and matched by DeWitt Weaver in 1997.</p>
        <p>The 63 wasn't Green's best round of the season. He had a tour-low 62 in the final round of the Audi Senior Classic in mid-March for his first victory of the year.</p>
        <p>Green hit 16 of 18 greens and 12 of 14 fairways to also tie the course record of 63 set by Lee Trevino in the 1994 pro-am.</p>
        <p>DAVIES OVERCOMES WIND: Laura Davies battled through wind gusts of up to 30 miles an hour yesterday to shoot a two-under-par 68 and take a three-stroke lead after the third round of the Philips Invitational in Austin, Tex.</p>
        <p>Davies heads into today's final round at seven under for the tournament and looking for her 60th international victory and 19th on the LPGA Tour.</p>
        <p>''I feel very in control of the golf ball, even in these conditions,'' Davies said. ''I've probably putted better than anybody this week. That's unquestionably why I'm leading.''</p>
        <p>Tammie Green chipped in twice on the last two holes to card a 67 for a share of second place with Susie Redman at four under.</p>
        <p>HARTMAN WINS PLAYOFF: Sean Hartman fought off a stomach virus to win the William Richardson Memorial Tournament on the second extra hole yesterday at the Seawane Club in Hewlett Harbor, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Hartman defeated Matt Corrigan, 3 and 2, in the morning semifinals and then beat Woody Lashen in a playoff on the 20th hole in the afternoon.</p>
        <p>In the title match of the tournament, named for a former golf writer of The New York Times, Hartman was 2 up with two holes to play. Lashen birdied the 17th and parred the 18th. Hartman had a par and bogey.</p>
        <p>On the second extra hole, Hartman drove to within 10 feet of the cup. Lashen, struggling after a poor tee shot, conceded the putt and the match.</p>
