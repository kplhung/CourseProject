        <p>BONNIE KRAMEN, who started a new job in Manhattan last September as business manager for the actress Olympia Dukakis, was driving home one night and saw a sign on the Jersey City side of the Holland Tunnel that read ''Newport Mall.''</p>
        <p>On an impulse, she drove in the direction the sign indicated.</p>
        <p>And she drove. And she drove.</p>
        <p>''There was one sign; that was it,'' she said. ''I ended up at the Hoboken train station.''</p>
        <p>Welcome to New Jersey, where it's easy to get lost -- even with a map -- because of missing, misleading, confusing, faded and obscured signs.</p>
        <p>''Don't blame us.''</p>
        <p>That's not a sign, that's a plea from the New Jersey State Department of Transportation, which says it recently completed a program upgrading its signs.</p>
        <p>The state says it has stopped using  signs hung from light poles at intersections and put up more mileage signs and ones that announce municipal boundaries. And it has added more route signs to conform to the state map.</p>
        <p>''People don't seem to get as lost as they used to,'' said a Transportation Department spokesman, John Dourgarian.</p>
        <p>Maybe not on state roads. But there are a lot of other kinds of roads in New Jersey, and a lot of confused drivers.</p>
        <p>Just ask 42-year-old Ms. Kramen. Born, raised and educated in New Jersey and proficient with a map, she insists this is the most difficult state to drive in.</p>
        <p>''The best are the faded signs, the ones you can barely read,'' she said. ''Or trying to confirm you're on the right street but you only get the cross street.''</p>
        <p>After getting directions from a police officer, she made it to the Newport Mall -- in about an hour altogether. And when it came time to return to Route 1/9, she thought, ''This should be easy.''</p>
        <p>''I knew I wasn't too far,'' she says. I saw this sign directing me to 1 and 9.''</p>
        <p>And she drove. And she drove.</p>
