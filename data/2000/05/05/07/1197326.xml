        <p>Early in the morning, the young and the hungry surf the Web for arcane food facts, entertaining tips and fanciful recipes. When dinner is still in the distance, people can afford to dream.</p>
        <p>But as the hours pass, the Lewises and Clarks of the morning become less adventurous by afternoon. Bye-bye fantasy food. Hello chicken.</p>
        <p>It happens every day. But it is not so much about chicken as it is about national character. Early on, faced with a vast wilderness, Americans were determined to tame the land, to make it predictable. Now, instead of geography, they must confront the chaos of daily life. In a frenetic world, there is comfort in the familiar. For decades, chicken has been America's most familiar culinary canvas -- and its popularity continues to grow.</p>
        <p>According to the National Chicken Council, an industry trade association in Washington, in 1960 the annual per capita consumption of chicken was 28 pounds. This year it is expected to be about 81 pounds, compared with about 66 pounds of beef.</p>
        <p>Of course, there are many things about chicken that recommend it. In a 1998 survey, consumers said they liked it for its taste, healthfulness, ease of preparation and -- what may be the most potent praise -- versatility.</p>
        <p>''I cook with it a few times a week,'' says Marie Rizzio of Traverse City, Mich. ''It's great for trying out new flavors. You can do anything with it.''</p>
        <p>Rizzio should know. Her Japanese ''amazu'' chicken recipe (a tempura with soy-and-sesame sauce) won the 1999 National Chicken Cooking Contest. Sponsored by the National Chicken Council and the U.S. Poultry and Egg Association, the contest has been around since 1949. Years of winning recipes -- from the broiled chicken deluxe of 1949 (''deluxe'' presumably because of the inclusion of paprika) to Rizzio's Japanese amazu chicken -- mirror American taste: eras of exotic cooking are followed by eras of down-home fare.</p>
        <p>During the 50's, the recipes were French-inspired -- chicken with almonds and chicken with tarragon and ''champignons.'' The early 60's were dominated by American-style golden-fried chicken, pecan-stuffed chicken breasts and other Deep South variations. The rest of the decade saw a rise in internationalism: date-lime chicken; chicken with curry, peanuts, coconut and bananas; chicken with dried mint and fresh lime; and ginger-peach chicken.</p>
        <p>In the 70's, exotica was eclipsed by buttermilk-pecan chicken, followed by a mix of canned and frozen concoctions: chicken nuggets with pineapple sauce, chicken potpie with frozen peas and chicken casserole with frozen asparagus.</p>
        <p>By the 80's, a more sophisticated taste of America took root. There is the specter of New York in chicken Reuben and the rise of California cuisine in chicken-avocado melt.</p>
        <p>Internationalism reigned again in the 90's, with Caribbean chicken drums in 1993 and baked spicy pineapple Balinese chicken in 1995.</p>
        <p>But, inevitably, Americans go back home. So far this year, according to Rec.food.recipes -- one of the original online recipe swaps -- the most frequently requested chicken recipe is simple roast chicken.</p>
        <p>To date, no study has clarified whether chicken is a choice or simply an amiable expedient. Rather, polls and statistics reveal that chicken is a constant. The chicken is us.</p>
        <p>Spiced Roast Chicken</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons dried yellow split peas</p>
        <p>3 dried red chilies</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon coriander seeds</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon cumin seeds</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon fenugreek seeds</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon mustard seeds</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon ground turmeric</p>
        <p>3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
        <p>1 whole chicken (about 3 1/2 pounds)</p>
        <p>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.</p>
        <p>1. Preheat the oven to 500 degrees. In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, heat the vegetable oil. Add the split peas and cook, stirring frequently, until lightly browned, about 40 seconds. Transfer to a bowl. Wipe the skillet clean and return it to medium heat. Add the chilies, coriander, cumin, peppercorns, fenugreek and mustard and cook, stirring, until toasted and fragrant, about 1 1/2 minutes. Add the turmeric and cook, stirring, 10 seconds more. Add to the split peas. When cool, transfer the mixture, in small batches, to a clean coffee grinder and pulse until finely ground. Place in a small bowl and stir in 2 tablespoons of the olive oil.</p>
        <p>2. Loosen the skin of the chicken over the breast and down to the thighs. Using your hands, spread all but 1 teaspoon of the spice paste evenly under the skin. Coat the outside of the chicken with the remaining teaspoon of paste and brush with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil. Season generously with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>3. Transfer the chicken to a roasting pan fitted with a rack and bake until very brown, about 20 minutes. Lower the temperature to 350 degrees and bake until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the inside of the thigh reads 170 degrees, or until the juices run clear when the chicken is pierced there with a knife, about 40 minutes more. Remove from the oven and set aside to rest for 10 minutes. Carve and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Original Chicken Cordon Bleu  (Adapted from ''American Gourmet,'' by Jane and Michael Stern, HarperCollins, 1991)</p>
        <p>4 large boned and skinned chicken breast halves (about 1 1/2 pounds)</p>
        <p>4 thin slices smoked ham</p>
        <p>2 ounces Swiss cheese, cut into 4 equal ''fingers''</p>
        <p>1/4 cup flour</p>
        <p>1/2 teaspoon salt</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon pepper</p>
        <p>1 large egg, beaten</p>
        <p>3/4 cup fresh bread crumbs</p>
        <p>1/4 cup unsalted butter</p>
        <p>1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons chicken stock</p>
        <p>1/2 cup white wine, heavy cream or additional chicken stock.</p>
        <p>1. Lay the chicken breasts between pieces of wax paper and use a mallet to pound them to between  1/4 inch and  1/8 inch thick. Take care not to pound holes in the chicken. Layer each breast with the ham, then place a finger of cheese in the center. Roll up to completely enclose the ham and cheese and secure with toothpicks.</p>
        <p>2. In a medium bowl, combine the flour, salt and pepper. Lightly dredge the chicken in the seasoned flour, then dip in the egg and coat with bread crumbs. Place on a baking sheet and chill at least 15 minutes and up to 4 hours.</p>
        <p>3. In a large skillet over medium heat, heat the butter. Add the chicken and cook, turning carefully with tongs, until browned, about 8 to 10 minutes. Add  1/2 cup of the stock to the skillet, reduce the heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until the chicken is cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Move the chicken to a warm platter.</p>
        <p>4. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of stock to the skillet, raise the heat to high, and cook, stirring up browned bits clinging to the bottom, for 1 minute. Add the wine (or heavy cream or additional stock), lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, until the consistency of gravy, about 45 seconds. Pour over the chicken breasts and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Shiitake-Crusted Chicken With Spinach Sauce  (Adapted from Michel Richard)</p>
        <p>For the sauce:</p>
        <p>8 cups stemmed and coarsely chopped spinach (about 10 ounces)</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</p>
        <p>1 small Spanish onion, chopped</p>
        <p>2 cloves garlic, finely chopped</p>
        <p>1 tablespoon Champagne vinegar</p>
        <p>1 cup homemade or low-sodium chicken broth</p>
        <p>1 teaspoon granulated sugar</p>
        <p>1/4 teaspoon curry powder</p>
        <p>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste</p>
        <p>For the chicken:</p>
        <p>3 tablespoons olive oil</p>
        <p>1 1/2 pounds shiitake mushrooms</p>
        <p>2 large shallots, coarsely chopped</p>
        <p>2 large cloves garlic, finely chopped</p>
        <p>Kosher salt and pepper to taste</p>
        <p>6 large boned and skinned chicken breast halves, tenderloins removed and reserved (about 2 1/4 pounds)</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons plain bread crumbs.</p>
        <p>1. To make the sauce, in a large pot of salted boiling water, cook the spinach until deep green, about 45 seconds. Drain it and transfer to a plate to cool. When cool enough to handle, squeeze out the excess liquid and set aside.</p>
        <p>2. In a medium saucepan over medium heat, heat the butter. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, vinegar, broth, sugar and curry and bring to a boil. Boil until reduced by a third, about 1 1/2 minutes. Stir in the spinach and return to a boil. Remove from the heat and set aside.</p>
        <p>3. When the spinach mixture has cooled, transfer to a blender and puree until smooth. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.</p>
        <p>4. To make the chicken, in a large skillet over high heat, heat 2 tablespoons of the oil. Add the mushrooms, shallots and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned and soft, about 6 minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Transfer the mushroom mixture to a baking sheet in an even layer and set aside to cool.</p>
        <p>5. Preheat the oven to 300 degrees. When the mushroom mixture is cool, transfer to a food processor with the chicken tenderloins and pulse until a paste forms. Divide the paste into 6 equal portions. Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper. On a work surface, lay out a 12-inch length of heavy-duty plastic wrap and place 1 portion of the paste in the center. Fold the plastic in half and, using a rolling pin, flatten the paste until slightly larger than half a chicken breast. Unfold the plastic and place a piece of chicken, smooth-side down, on the paste and gather the plastic up and around the breast. Cut the excess plastic and discard. Transfer the wrapped chicken, paste-side up, to a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining paste and chicken breasts. Bake until firm and cooked through, about 25 minutes. (The plastic will not melt.)</p>
        <p>6. Remove the chicken from the oven and preheat the broiler. Carefully unwrap the plastic and return the breasts, paste-side up, to the baking sheet relined with foil. Brush with the remaining tablespoon of oil and lightly sprinkle with bread crumbs. Broil until golden brown, about 3 minutes. Set aside for 5 minutes.</p>
        <p>7. Reheat the sauce. Slice the breast halves on the diagonal and arrange each one on a plate, fanning out the slices. Ladle the sauce alongside each breast and serve.</p>
        <p>Yield: 6 servings.</p>
