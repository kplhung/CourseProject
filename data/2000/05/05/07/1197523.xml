      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The question and answer session with Commissioner Arthur J. Rocque of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (March 26) leaves more questions for your readers than answers. Without shame, Mr. Rocque unabashedly supports his small minority of hunters at the mortal peril of the state's majority.</p>
        <p>Wouldn't banning hunting eliminate all death and injury from this non-sport as well as save Connecticut taxpayers' money? And why do we have an obviously biased hunter making decisions that benefit only his hunter clients?</p>

        <p>The question and answer session with Commissioner Arthur J. Rocque of the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection (March 26) leaves more questions for your readers than answers. Without shame, Mr. Rocque unabashedly supports his small minority of hunters at the mortal peril of the state's majority.</p>
        <p>Wouldn't banning hunting eliminate all death and injury from this non-sport as well as save Connecticut taxpayers' money? And why do we have an obviously biased hunter making decisions that benefit only his hunter clients?</p>
        <p>Mr. Rocque's statistic of 800,000 annual hunting hours is equivalent to almost three billion seconds. It takes less than a second for a hunting tragedy to occur.</p>
        <p>In the modern world there is nothing ethical about hunting. It's time for a change. Ban hunting. Save lives.</p>
        <p>BOB ORABONA</p>
        <p>Mr. Orabona is the operations director of Friends of Animals, an international organization based in Darien.</p>
