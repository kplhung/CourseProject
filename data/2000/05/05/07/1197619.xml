        <p>This is the time of year when affluent families begin planning their summer getaways to the seashore or the mountains. But for millions of New York City kids, there is no escape from a city that seems to get hotter every summer. The best they can hope for is a splash or two in an overcrowded pool or under a fire-hydrant sprinkler.</p>
        <p>Thanks to the Fresh Air Fund, however, some city children whose families cannot afford the luxury of a vacation will soon discover a new world of green lawns, sparkling lakes and clear streams. Since its founding in 1877, this not-for-profit, New York-based organization has sent more than 1.7 million children between the ages of 5 and 15 to a world where houses come with grass and trees, where the air is clean and the nights are cool and quiet save for the sounds of nature.</p>

        <p>This is the time of year when affluent families begin planning their summer getaways to the seashore or the mountains. But for millions of New York City kids, there is no escape from a city that seems to get hotter every summer. The best they can hope for is a splash or two in an overcrowded pool or under a fire-hydrant sprinkler.</p>
        <p>Thanks to the Fresh Air Fund, however, some city children whose families cannot afford the luxury of a vacation will soon discover a new world of green lawns, sparkling lakes and clear streams. Since its founding in 1877, this not-for-profit, New York-based organization has sent more than 1.7 million children between the ages of 5 and 15 to a world where houses come with grass and trees, where the air is clean and the nights are cool and quiet save for the sounds of nature.</p>
        <p>This year, about 10,000 inner-city children will benefit from the program. Of these, about 6,000 will spend two weeks or more with host families in a dozen states and Canada under the fund's Friendly Town program. Many of these children form lasting bonds with their hosts, returning summer after summer. In addition, the fund will send nearly 3,000 children to its camps in the hills near Fishkill, N.Y. The fund also maintains an off-season camping program near Fishkill for 1,000 disadvantaged youngsters.</p>
        <p>The Friendly Town families provide food  and accommodations, but there are transportation and other costs. A two-week Friendly Town visit costs $490, while two weeks at a fund camp costs $1,036. More than 80 percent of the fund's operating budget comes from individual contributions. Last year, the fund received 55,627 gifts totaling  $5.2 million. This year's goal is $5.36 million by  Sept. 30.</p>
        <p>Tax-deductible donations can be sent to the Fresh Air Fund, 1040 Avenue of the Americas, New York, N.Y. 10018. Families wishing to become Friendly Town hosts may write to the same address or call (800) 367-0003 or (212) 897-8900.</p>
