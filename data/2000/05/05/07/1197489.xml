        <p>There is no question as to where ''Delia's Trousseau,'' wallpaper hand-printed with furry coats, chemises and peach-colored lingerie, belongs: Mom's boudoir. The design was a 1920's gouache painting, said Christopher Adlington of Lee Jofa, the Manhattan wallpaper company (212-688-0444) that introduced Delia's Trousseau this spring. A matching glazed cotton fabric will be offered in June. Some designs have little tabs, as if the pictures were for a paper-doll book. The wallpaper sells to the trade for $250 a five-yard roll; the fabric is $98 a yard.</p>
