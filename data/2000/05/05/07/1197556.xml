        <p>For all of its 18 years, only money has rained on the Frederick Law Olmsted Awards luncheon given by the Women's Committee of the Central Park Conservancy. In the Conservatory Garden at Fifth Avenue and 104th Street, the event on Wednesday raised $3 million. Over the years it has raised $230 million to restore the park. In a setting that suggested the ''My Fair Lady'' Ascot scene in modern dress, 1,200 guests, including 100 men, entered through the Vanderbilt Gate. As Andrea Lans, a guest, said of the hundreds of women wearing hats, ''I just love being a girl.''</p>
