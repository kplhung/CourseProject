        <p>POACHING is often overlooked as a method of cooking meat, fish and poultry, but it offers several advantages: it's uncomplicated. Once you grasp the technique, it is extremely useful for preparing a dish that can be served hot or cold. And it is low in fat. All you need alongside is sauce or a condiment, assembed from scratch or bought in a store.</p>
        <p>Whole chicken served without the skin, lean filet of beef and whole fish, fillets or fish steaks are best for poaching. Duck can also be poached, as can leg of lamb. The method will not tenderize, so it is not suitable for cuts like shoulder or brisket.</p>

        <p>POACHING is often overlooked as a method of cooking meat, fish and poultry, but it offers several advantages: it's uncomplicated. Once you grasp the technique, it is extremely useful for preparing a dish that can be served hot or cold. And it is low in fat. All you need alongside is sauce or a condiment, assembed from scratch or bought in a store.</p>
        <p>Whole chicken served without the skin, lean filet of beef and whole fish, fillets or fish steaks are best for poaching. Duck can also be poached, as can leg of lamb. The method will not tenderize, so it is not suitable for cuts like shoulder or brisket.</p>
        <p>Well-seasoned stock is the best poaching medium, and once it has been used for this purpose, it can easily be skimmed, frozen and re-used. The poaching liquid should never come to a full boil. The meat, fish or poultry is added to the simmering liquid, which is then reduced to a slow simmer. The tasty meat juices will not seep out into the liquid but stay inside to flavor the food, as they would if the cooking started with cold liquid. It's the difference between making stock and making dinner.</p>
        <p>Poached Chicken With Green Sauce  Total time: 1 1/2 hours</p>
        <p>3 quarts well-seasoned chicken stock  1 3 1/2-pound chicken  6 cloves garlic  1 teaspoon whole white peppercorns  1 teaspoon whole coriander seeds  1 large onion, peeled and halved  Salt  1 cup, loosely packed, flat-leaf parsley leaves  1 teaspoon drained capers  2 tablespoons white-wine vinegar</p>
        <p>1/3 cup extra-virgin olive oil  Juice of  1/2 lemon  1 tablespoon Dijon mustard  Freshly ground black pepper to taste  Parsley sprigs and lemon wedges for garnish.</p>
        <p>1. Bring stock to a simmer in a saucepan or pot large enough to hold chicken. Lightly crush four cloves of garlic, peppercorns and coriander seeds. Add along with onion and salt to taste. Add chicken. Bring to a fast simmer, just under a boil, and cook five minutes, skimming constantly. Lower heat to very slow simmer and poach chicken about an hour, skimming from time to time, until leg juices run clear. Remove from heat and allow to cool in stock 30 minutes.</p>
        <p>2. Turn on food processor. Drop remaining garlic in through feed tube and process until chopped. Shut off processor, scrape down sides of container and add parsley, capers and vinegar. Process until blended. Drizzle in olive oil and lemon juice. Remove to small bowl and stir in mustard. Season to taste with salt and pepper.</p>
        <p>3. Remove chicken from poaching liquid. Reserve poaching liquid for another use, as stock or soup.</p>
        <p>4. Remove skin from chicken. Cut up chicken in serving pieces and put on a platter. Decorate with parsley sprigs and lemon wedges and serve with green sauce.  Yield: 4 servings.</p>
        <p>Poached Filet of Beef With Mustard Sauce  Total time: 1 hour 10 minutes</p>
        <p>1 whole filet of beef, about 3 pounds, well trimmed and tied, at room temperature  4 quarts beef stock</p>
        <p>1/2 cup Dijon mustard  2 tablespoons good-quality balsamic vinegar  3 tablespoons honey  3 tablespoons sweet sherry  A few drops of fresh lemon juice.</p>
        <p>1. In a pan large enough to hold the filet covered with liquid, bring stock to afast simmer, just under a boil. Gently add beef. Allow stock to return to slow simmer. Poach 45 minutes, until instant-read thermometer registers 125 to 130 degrees for medium rare.</p>
        <p>2. Remove meat from stock and set on cutting board loosely covered with foil 15 minutes. Reserve stock for another use.</p>
        <p>3. Combine remaining ingredients in small saucepan and heat until just warm. Transfer to serving bowl.</p>
        <p>4. Remove trussing string from meat and slice about a half-inch thick. Arrange on platter and serve with sauce on the side.  Yield: 8 servings.</p>
        <p>Poached Salmon Steaks With Cucumber Salsa  Total time: 30 minutes</p>
        <p>6 medium-size cucumbers, peeled and seeded  Salt  1 1/2 cups dry white wine  2 cups fish stock  1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice  1 teaspoon crushed white peppercorns  1 bay leaf  1 small onion, quartered  6 salmon steaks, each about 8 ounces and 1-inch thick  5 tablespoons rice vinegar  1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh cilantro leaves  1 jalapeno chili, seeded and minced  1 tablespoon finely minced fresh ginger  2 tablespoons Asian (toasted) sesame oil.</p>
        <p>1. Finely chop cucumbers by hand or in food processor. Toss generously with salt and put in strainer over bowl. Set aside to drain.</p>
        <p>2. In large skillet or fish poacher combine wine, stock, lemon juice, peppercorns, bay leaf, onion and salt to taste. Simmer 10 minutes. Add fish. Adjust heat so water barely simmers. Cook three minutes. Remove from heat and allow fish to cool to room temperature in the liquid.</p>
        <p>3. Meanwhile, rinse cucumbers and drain well, pressing out all excess moisture. Put in bowl and fold in rice vinegar, cilantro, chili and ginger. Season to taste with salt.</p>
        <p>4. Remove salmon from poaching liquid, pat dry and brush with oil. Serve with cucumber salsa.  Yield: 6 servings.</p>
