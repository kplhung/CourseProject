        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I am a stay-at-home mother, with kids between 4 and 8, dedicated to not letting the culture grow my kids up too fast. The only Cartoon Network shows we watch regularly are the old shows, as we call them: ''Tom and Jerry,''  ''The Flintstones,''  ''The Jetsons'' and, best of all, ''Scooby-Doo.'' We watch few if any of the new shows. I have often complained to friends that the Cartoon Network must hire writers who are inexpensive 20-something men who have no social lives and obviously have no children. I find these cartoons which Peter Marks claims to be ''some of the most innovative new animation on television'' [''Now Mom and Dad Are Going Cartoon-Crazy, Too,'' April 16] to be nihilistic, anti-authority, jaded, sarcastic and often vulgar.</p>

        <p>I can appreciate the creativity and passion these people have brought to the cartoon genre, but creativity and passion alone aren't enough. How about an allegiance to their market of young minds and hearts? If the Cartoon Network has now attracted an audience of adults, how about spinning off an adult cartoon network. Let children be children.</p>
