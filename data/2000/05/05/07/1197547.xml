        <p>After 46 years at Broadway near 114th Street, Mama Joy's, a four-aisle food store that was well known for its fancy cheeses, freshly made sandwiches and wide selection of beers, has closed.</p>
        <p>''These types of stores are very labor-intensive,'' said the owner, Herbie Estrin, on the final day of business, April 29. ''It's really hard to enjoy life with a small retail business.''</p>
        <p>The grocery was a family business, and another reason Mr. Estrin thought it was time to go was that his mother and brother, who used to run the store with him, died a few years ago.</p>
        <p>The store had deep roots in Morningside Heights. ''I had to call my parents'' about the closing, said Bergin O'Malley, a Columbia University student who had shopped there with her family for years. ''I know the people here. You say hi to them; they say hi to you. They actually care about saying hi.''</p>
        <p>Gerald Kahn, a retired software developer who shopped at Mama Joy's for 40 years, said: ''This is what keeps us fed. It's not for nothing it is called Mama Joy's.''</p>
        <p>As his wife, Charlotte, a psychoanalyst, stocked up on smoked beef, she added, ''They have things I can't get anywhere else.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Estrin's Russian immigrant parents, Paul and Lillian Estrin, bought the shop in 1954 and ran it as a one-counter convenience store called Joy's Self-Service. Even as a child, Mr. Estrin worked in the shop. Money was tight. The family named the store Joy's Self-Service because they could only afford to change one letter from the store's previous name, Jay's Self-Service.</p>
        <p>But over the years the family has expanded both the store, in a building owned by Columbia, and its menu.</p>
        <p>''We were small, so we had to have something to distinguish ourselves from the supermarkets,'' Mr. Estrin said. The sandwiches created by Mr. Estrin's mother became popular with students. They called her Mama Joy because of the store's name, and eventually the name became official.</p>
        <p>For now, Mr. Estrin said, he plans to help run the University Food Market, at Broadway and 115th Street, which he set up with a partner about 12 years ago. He said he would move his cheese, delicatessen and beer there. He also said he would do volunteer work.</p>
        <p>The Columbia community recognizes that it has lost a neighborhood institution. Bill Scott, deputy vice president for institutional real estate at Columbia, said no replacement had yet emerged. ''We haven't gotten that far,'' he said. ''We don't replace our 46-year-old tenants that fast.''</p>
