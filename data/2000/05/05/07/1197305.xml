        <p>THE CABAL</p>
        <p>And Other Stories.</p>
        <p>By Ellen Gilchrist.</p>
        <p>Little, Brown, $24.95.</p>
        <p>The world Ellen Gilchrist unfolds in her vivid new story collection is rich with intimate exchanges between finely etched characters. The stories here -- particularly the title novella -- are convincingly chaotic. Characters' lives and interests intersect and bump against one another in ways that are at once random and entirely natural. In ''The Cabal,'' Jim Jaspers, a beloved psychiatrist to the elite of Jackson, Miss., becomes unhinged and begins spilling patients' secrets. Few of these confidences prove to have been very well hidden to begin with, but his behavior proves enormously unsettling to the town. This material might make for a spare, lapidary story in another writer's hands, but Gilchrist's narrative spins off into detailed stories about the lives of Jaspers's patients that are as absorbing as the doctor's own tale. We meet and come to care about a punky undergraduate, a gay professor of literature and a recently dead theater doyenne, among others. Further details of some of these characters' lives emerge in the five shorter pieces here. As ever, Gilchrist's writing emanates love for the shaggy, uncontainable nature of life; she refuses to contain her characters in stories that offer any artificial sense of closure.</p>
