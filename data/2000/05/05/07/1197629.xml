        <p>So the volatility of technology stocks is on the rise. But what -- if anything -- can investors do about it?</p>
        <p>In an April 30 research report, Edward Kerschner, chief investment strategist at PaineWebber, offers this advice: Grin and bear it.</p>
        <p>According to Mr. Kerschner, the average daily price change of the technology sector, as tracked by Standard &amp; Poor's, was 1.07 percent from 1993 through 1999, though it rose steadily over that period. This year through April, it was 2.29 percent, or more than twice that figure.</p>
        <p>As volatility increases, creating more peaks and valleys in stock prices, so does the temptation for investors to time the market. To see the potential, consider the path of the technology sector. From 1993 through April of this year, its compound annual growth rate was 38.6 percent, more than double the 17.8 percent of the S.&amp; P. 500-stock index. But say an investor was a perfect market timer over that period -- putting all of his or her portfolio into technology stocks, but switching to the broader market every month the technology stocks underperformed. Bingo! That growth rate rises to 59.6 percent.</p>
        <p>The problem, of course, is when to jump and when to sit tight. And despite all the investor talk of ''January effects'' and ''summer doldrums,'' Mr. Kerschner says that there appears to be no seasonality in the technology stocks' outperformance of the broader market.</p>
        <p>Without a methodology to help decide  when to trade out of technology stocks, market-timing is even more difficult. And as technology stocks' volatility has risen, so has the implied cost of a wrong market-timing decision.</p>
        <p>Say a market-timing technology investor switched into the S.&amp; P. 500 for just one month in a given year, but that month happened to be the one in which technology stocks performed best. Back in 1993, such a mistake would have shaved 5.1 percentage points of the market-timers'  returns for the year. In 1996, 9.6 percentage points would have been sacrificed. And in 1999, the error would have cost a fat 20.1 percentage points in potential gains.</p>
        <p>''We are in the information age,'' Mr. Kerschner wrote in his report. ''Tech stocks define that age. And just as they offer unprecendented growth opportunities, they also offer unprecedented volatility.''</p>
        <p>In other words, caveat trader. ''How to play?'' he asked. ''Don't try to time it.''</p>
