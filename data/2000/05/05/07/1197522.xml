        <p>Clare Rossini letter holds Colin McEnroe's April 30 article on woes afflicting Hartford, Conn, neglected to mention positive steps that have been taken, including revival of city's riverfront</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In his recent tally of the woes afflicting Hartford (April 30), Colin McEnroe neglects to note the city's biggest problem: professional nay-sayers like himself who seem to take perverse pleasure in their Hartford-as-basket-case views.</p>
        <p>There's plenty of work to be done in Hartford, no doubt about it. But one could counter Mr. McEnroe's list with one equally convincing in its positive tone. Among the items on such a list might be Hartford's recent recapture of its glorious riverfront, the additions under way at the Bushnell Theater and the city's downtown library as well as the Learning Corridor project, which has already put a fresh face on the city's South End.</p>

        <p>There's plenty of work to be done in Hartford, no doubt about it. But one could counter Mr. McEnroe's list with one equally convincing in its positive tone. Among the items on such a list might be Hartford's recent recapture of its glorious riverfront, the additions under way at the Bushnell Theater and the city's downtown library as well as the Learning Corridor project, which has already put a fresh face on the city's South End.</p>
        <p>Near the end of his piece, Mr. McEnroe makes much of the fact that when his radio station moved out of Hartford, he chose to remain downtown at his own expense. Therefore, he claims, he is no sneering suburbanite.</p>
        <p>But is a sneering urbanite any better?</p>
        <p>What's the point of staying in Hartford if one's not going to use one's  talent and influence to move the community forward?</p>
