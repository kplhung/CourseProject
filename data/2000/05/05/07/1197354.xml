        <p>A THREE-THEATER complex for foreign and independent films is to be built in the heart of this village's sleepy downtown, about 30 miles north of Manhattan and nine miles north of White Plains.</p>
        <p>A former movie house that had been converted into an office building about a decade ago will house the main component of the new Jacob Burns Film Center, a 18,000-square-foot complex that will include a 275-seat main theater and two smaller theaters to be built on adjacent land that had most recently been a parking lot. The project received a $1.5 million gift from the Jacob Burns Foundation, a family foundation named for a local lawyer and philanthropist who died in 1993.</p>
        <p>The two smaller theaters, one with 145 seats and the other a 70-seat screening room, will be for ''specialized films that would attract a smaller audience,'' said Stephen Apkon, executive director of the center. ''All the theaters will be open to the public,'' Mr. Apkon said, ''although our screening room could also be rented out for special private screenings.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Apkon, a former investment banker, said that the Film Society of Lincoln Center would help provide programming. ''This is the first time that Lincoln Center has reached out beyond Manhattan in this way,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Film Society's executive vice president, Joanne Koch, said she was at first ''a little reluctant to get involved in something off our premises.''</p>
        <p>''But we traveled up to the site and got excited about the whole project,'' Ms. Koch said, ''and thought it be might be the right time and place for us to stretch out a bit.''</p>
        <p>A ground-breaking ceremony was held on April 25, and interior demolition of the existing building has already begun, Mr. Apkon said. ''We expect to start the construction phase soon,'' he said. ''We should be completed and open to the public early next year.''</p>
        <p>Mayor John Nonna of Pleasantville said he expects the new theater complex to help revitalize the village's downtown, which has been troubled in recent years by vacancies.</p>
        <p>''We've been without a movie theater for so long,'' Mr. Nonna said. ''I expect that the center will make for a livelier downtown and be a tremendous boost to our businesses, especially our restaurants.'' Four restaurants are within walking distance of the theater, the mayor said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Apkon said that for years he had hoped to create a film center in Westchester. ''This kind of complex just doesn't exist in the suburbs north of Manhattan,'' he said. There are now two venues in the county that offer foreign and independent films: the Ackerman Fine Arts theater in Greenburgh and the Paramount Center theater in Peekskill, where the actor Stanley Tucci, a resident of Katonah, recently held a special screening of his new film, ''Joe Gould's Secret.''</p>
        <p>Yonkers has announced its intention to build a small theater for art films in a converted trolley barn as part of its waterfront redevelopment project, which is still in the planning stages.</p>
        <p>''We'll be the only film center in Westchester that is dedicated to the showing of such films,'' Mr. Apkon said, ''and the only one with a screening room for special events. If a film maker wants to preview his film to a special smaller audience, we'd provide that.''</p>
        <p>In addition, the Jacob Burns Film Center plans to offer readings and panel discussions on films. ''We could also have occasional live theatrical and musical performances,'' Mr. Apkon said, ''but the emphasis will be on cinema.''</p>
        <p>The project started taking shape, he said, after he found out in 1998 that the former Rome Theater, at 364 Manville Road in Pleasantville, was for sale. The Guild Group, an advertising agency that had owned and occupied the building, was looking for larger quarters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Apkon formed Friends of the Rome Theater, a nonprofit organization, and purchased the 11,000-square-foot former theater, and a 6,000-square-foot parcel of land next door, in 1998 for $1 million, he said. The entire project is expected to cost about $6.5 million.</p>
        <p>''We expect to receive some funding from the Westchester County Industrial Development Agency,'' he said, ''and we'll soon be launching a $5 million capital campaign'' for the building project and the first year's operating budget.</p>
        <p>Terry Waivada, the development agency's executive director, said the center had been approved for bond financing.</p>
        <p>The Rome Theater opened in Pleasantville in 1925 and closed in 1987. In its later years, it was a two-screen theater; when it was converted to an office building, its interior was almost completely gutted.</p>
        <p>The theater was built in the Spanish Mission style, and its barrel-tiled roof, porticos, outside columns and pediment remain intact. ''We plan to maintain the facade as it is,'' said Nat Hoyt, associate partner at Davis Brody Bond Architects, the Manhattan-based firm that is designing the center.  ''We plan to restore the center door, which had been removed and replaced with a window. The marquee will also be replaced, and the building will look much as it did before.''</p>
        <p>The two other new theaters will be added onto the main building and enclosed in glass, Mr. Hoyt said. ''With the main theater such a particular look,'' he said, ''trying to attach something in the same vein would look like a pastiche. We thought the thing to do was something very modern and sleek-looking.''</p>
        <p>ALL that remains of the old theater's interior are the projection booths, Mr. Hoyt said. He said his firm plans to create a ''very open'' interior design with a lobby and concession stand and a staircase leading to a second-floor cafe, library and exhibition and gallery space.</p>
        <p>The original Rome Theater had 459 seats, but the new main theater will have only 275. ''Moviegoers today expect more comfort and room,'' Mr. Apkon said. ''The new seats will be wider, with more space in between.''</p>
        <p>The front half of the theater will have the ''traditional rake,'' or slant, of most theaters, Mr. Apkon said; ''the rear will have stadium seating, to provide good sight lines for all seats.''</p>
        <p>There will no center aisle. ''We're trying to create an experience that's different from the average multiplex,'' he said, ''where people are walking down center aisles to get to their seats. Most movie theaters sacrifice the best seats by having center aisles. We'll only have side aisles.''</p>
        <p>Davis Brody Bond also designed the 268-seat Walter Reade Theater at Lincoln Center. ''The main theater at the Jacob Burns Center will be similar to the Walter Reade,'' Mr. Hoyt said, ''but a bit more casual, more attuned to its area.''</p>
        <p>Some village residents had expressed concern that the film center would create parking congestion downtown, Mayor Nonna said. But since most theater activities will take place in the evenings, the mayor said, the theater's owner was able ''to make arrangements with banks and merchants in the area to use their parking lots after business hours.''</p>
        <p>''The downtown commuter lots can also be used at night,'' he said. ''I don't anticipate any problems, only benefits. A project like this can only bring good things.''</p>
