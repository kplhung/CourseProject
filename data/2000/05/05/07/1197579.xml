        <p>AN unsuspecting woman received a bouquet of flowers recently at her Fifth Avenue home. Set in a silver-plated urn, the $350 arrangement was lush with romantic pink roses, Italian poppies, deep-purple sweet peas, calla lilies and a card that read, ''We'd be a good match.''</p>
        <p>Her secret admirer? A floral designer named David Beahm, whose intentions were not particularly romantic. The object of his attentions is a member of the organizing committee for a fall fund-raising gala for the Metropolitan Opera, with the unofficial position of flower chairwoman: she picks the florist who picks the flowers.</p>
        <p>The unsolicited arrangement was ''a courting bouquet,'' Mr. Beahm explained. He sent it in hopes of winning the account to provide flowers for a party that annually attracts some of New York's richest and swellest, names like Kissinger, Kravis and Bass. (He didn't want to reveal the woman's name, out of fear that his competitors would court her as well.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Beahm sends up to five courting bouquets a week this time of year, with a retail value of $250 to $400 each, to women all over the city who are immersed in the charity social circuit and are selecting the decor for fall benefits. Doing flowers for the $1,000-a-plate dinners can make the career of an ambitious florist. Centerpieces that provoke oohs and ahhs among the guests can lead to contracts to provide arrangements at extravagant society weddings and Park Avenue dinner parties, and to fill the floral needs of hostesses like Carroll Petrie, who spends up to $20,000 a week in the summer filling her Southampton house with Casablanca lilies and white mixed blooms.</p>
        <p>The ''flower chairs'' and those who advise them are the keys to this lucrative business, and they are courted in ways that go well beyond sending a free bouquet. Four florists discussed how, to win these women's favor, they provide flowers at discounts of 50 to 75 percent for the private needs of some of the city's wealthiest and most socially active hostesses. The largesse includes fresh flowers sent weekly to the women's homes, bouquets that they send to friends as thank-yous for dinner invitations and reductions of tens of thousands of dollars from the going price for their daughters' weddings.</p>
        <p>The deep discounts are little known outside the world of the ultrasocial. ''It's simply the way most of my friends keep fresh flowers in their houses year round,'' said Arlene Dahl, an actress who can be seen at many a Park Avenue dinner party. ''It's like buying wholesale.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Dahl, who chooses the decor for the Oscar party for New York members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and for annual galas by the Pearl S. Buck Foundation and the New York Cancer Society, said that at this time of year, her apartment is abloom with courting bouquets. She considers it an innocuous form of petty bribery, she said, adding, ''It's in the course of business.''</p>
        <p>She has not chosen florists for public events as a result of price breaks for her personal flowers, she said, but she knows others who do. In general, women who receive personal discounts say they see nothing unethical in choosing a florist for a public fund-raiser and receiving discounts for one's personal use.</p>
        <p>The practice is related to the quiet but widespread convention that allows some of New York's best-dressed, most socially visible women, who are often most able to pay full price, to receive clothes free from designers, or have their homes furnished at a deep discount. ''Doing an apartment for free or at 'a special price' is the only way for some newcomers to get the caliber of clients on their roster,'' said Mario Buatta, the interior decorator. ''These women kind of sponsor you.''</p>
        <p>Polly Onet, a party planner with wide experience among the beau monde, agreed. ''That's New York,'' she said. ''Look at the girls we know who get all these cut-rate designer clothes, and they are loaded and they don't pay a dime, for clothes or jewelry. We see them every night, and they don't even dry-clean the clothes before they bring them back to the designer, and the designer doesn't care -- he is just happy that they are wearing the clothes.''</p>
        <p>Sharyn Mann, another object of Mr. Beahm's attention, is a well-connected social figure with homes in Manhattan and Quogue, N.Y., which she likes to keep well appointed with fresh blooms. ''Flowers are your calling card,'' she said. ''They represent you and your taste. Flowers are like angels blessing the room.''</p>
        <p>One day recently, Ms. Mann was showing Mr. Beahm pictures of a 28-acre island she and her husband, Stephen, an investment banker, had bought in Vero Beach, Fla. Sitting on the down-filled damask couch in the family room of her Fifth Avenue duplex, Ms. Mann said, ''David is going to see the property before my husband.'' (Mr. Mann had approved the purchase sight unseen.) She turned to Mr. Beahm to say, ''We must go to Vero Beach soon.'' Mr. Beahm agreed. With a blush on his cheeks and glee in his voice, he said, ''I already have ideas of what we're going to do.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Beahm had that week filled Ms. Mann's living room overlooking Central Park with more than $600 worth of Kwanzan cherry blossoms and lilacs, at no cost. Ms. Mann, who was chairwoman of the Food Allergy Ball at the Plaza in December, hired him to do the flowers for the 70 tables at the event, which raised more than $2.2 million for charity. Ms. Mann introduced him to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Valerie Zilkha, Fe Fendi, Iris Love and CeCe Kieselstein-Cord.</p>
        <p>''My head was spinning with all the contacts,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''If you make the right people happy and then meet the right people, that hopefully is going to make the discount worthwhile,'' he added. By the same logic, he said he did the gala flowers for $20,000, with the cost covered by an anonymous sponsor, though the job was really worth more than $80,000.</p>
        <p>Ms. Mann said it is natural for an up-and-coming florist to offer a discounted fee for a high-profile assignment like her gala. ''He was just starting, unknown in New York, so it was understood if he was good to me, I in turn would be good to him by introducing him to everyone I know,'' she said. ''I purposefully looked for someone just starting. Other people who are established and well known don't try that hard.''</p>
        <p>As for the flowers he provides for little or nothing for her apartment, she denied using her position with the gala for personal gain. ''I have never asked for anything personally,'' she said. ''Whatever David charges, we pay the bill.'' Even if that bill is sometimes nothing.</p>
        <p>Another charity woman, who receives about $300 worth of peonies and roses for her home each week, paying only about $100, also defended the practice. ''Look, what's wrong with receiving discounted flowers at home?'' she said, sipping a cocktail during a ''tailgate party'' at the New York Auto Show to benefit the East Side Settlement House last month. This woman is not a flower chairwoman, but she has many prominent friends. ''We are giving these boys a big opportunity,'' she said, ''and you know, important people come to my home and see what they do.''</p>
        <p>In fact, many florists say they refuse to court socialites, either with the occasional sample floral display or with more valuable long-term discounts. ''I know it goes on,'' said Helena Lehane, a floral designer who places arrangements every week in the homes of several Upper East Side billionaires. ''I think integrity has something to do with it. I have preferred over my career not to court.''</p>
        <p>Those who do court justify it as good business sense. Gaige Clark, a co-owner of Spruce, whose clients include the model Amber Valletta and the actress Julianne Moore, said, ''I do give special discounts to special clients.''</p>
        <p>''Doing business with them has helped our name get out there, considering who they are sending their flowers to: people in fashion, people in the film industry,'' Ms. Clark said.</p>
        <p>Some florists never have to weigh the ethical or economic issues, because they are already so busy they don't have to offer discounts. Two designers, Robert Isabell and Philip Baloun, have long had a near duopoly on society parties and benefits, and both deny courting clients with personal discounts. In fact, hostesses sometimes grumble about their high prices. Donna Harvey, a senior account manager at George Trescher Associates, which organizes charity fund-raisers, said it was hard to stay within a budget when planning a party with one of the top-tier florists.</p>
        <p>''They are very talented, but many times we have to look elsewhere for someone who is eager for the business,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Lauren Veronis, another socialite involved in the charity world, is heavily courted by up-and-coming florists. ''If you get a nod from Lauren Veronis, you're in for the long haul,'' one florist said.</p>
        <p>Ms. Veronis, who was chairwoman this spring of a gala celebrating the 30th anniversary of Zubin Mehta's directorship of the Israel Philharmonic and a buffet dinner at the Four Seasons for the Irvington Institute for Immunological Research, is flattered by the sentiment. For both events, Ms. Veronis broke with the florist she has long favored, Mr. Isabell. ''We used Robert for years, and he was wonderful,'' she said. ''But it was time to move on and give the up-and-coming a chance.''</p>
        <p>For both events she chose David Tutera, a party planner in Mamaroneck, N.Y., who, she said, has not given her any discounts for personal flowers.</p>
        <p>''The understanding always is when they do a big charity that there is no budget for the party,'' she said. ''We want all of our proceeds to go to the basic research, so we're delighted to provide the audience for their work to give them big exposure. But in return they have to work below cost.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tutera, whose clients include Clarissa Bronfman, several Tisch family members and Iris Cantor, said: ''I don't exactly give them financial discounts. I give them more attention and hand-holding. Personally, I'm totally with them every step of the way and I make sure they get the best flowers.</p>
        <p>''I know in the long run what I will receive if I give them a lot of attention. I know who is on their guest list. The secret to being successful in the society world in New York is all word of mouth, and I know what they can do for me if I give them a better product for a little less.''</p>
        <p>Another up-and-coming florist who does give Ms. Veronis a price break is Lisa Marie McWilliams, who said she provides flowers for the Veronis homes in New York and Southampton more than 40 times a year, for 40 percent less than the going rate. Ms. McWilliams said she was so grateful for the exposure her work receives because she is Ms. Veronis's florist that she would not think of charging more. Moreover, it is her way of repaying Ms. Veronis for encouraging her to leave a previous employer and go into business on her own. ''I owe so much to her,'' said Ms. McWilliams, who has not handled any of the charity accounts Ms. Veronis oversees, but hopes to in the future.</p>
        <p>Ms. Veronis said she had never asked Ms. McWilliams for a discount, and seemed unaware she was receiving one. ''Whenever I use anyone personally, I have never received a reduction or asked for one,'' she said. ''It would be inappropriate to expect something like that.''</p>
        <p>The hand-holding that florists provide is no small thing on the social circuit. Like fashion designers, interior designers and even some hairstylists, florists have gone from being members of a service class to escorts and dinner-party guests in some of the swankest company. At a gala for the Horticultural Society of New York on Tuesday, where the city's new and old society converged around 40 tables set with flowers by 48 designers, Suzette de Marigny Smith, a chairwoman of the event, described ''the very special relationship'' some people have with florists.</p>
        <p>''They have to be little geniuses,'' she said. ''They have to know more about you than your dressmaker and your interior decorator and your caterer.''</p>
        <p>Ms. de Marigny Smith, who was wearing a Sander Witlin gold lame dress with hand-painted irises and waving a gold wand, said some of the florists ''are very amusing and attractive people, and they are good conversationalists, and they're just fun to have at parties -- like flowers.''</p>
        <p>Another coveted assignment for floral designers is the society wedding. Some admit that they are willing to offer huge discounts on jobs worth tens of thousands of dollars to have their work seen at its most extravagant by the right crowd.</p>
        <p>Joanne de Guardiola, an interior designer who is a player in prominent charities like the Society of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and the New York Botanical Garden (she is fashion chairwoman of the garden's June gala), could have hired a name-brand florist for the wedding of her stepdaughter, Jeanne de Guardiola, next month. Instead, she is using Ms. McWilliams.</p>
        <p>''This could be very big for me,'' Ms. McWilliams said. ''There will be a lot of important people there who could very well recommend me for the next step, the charity parties.'' She said she would charge the family $50,000 to $75,000, less than half what a comparable job for another wedding would cost.</p>
        <p>Ms. McWilliams, who speaks to Joanne de Guardiola every week, is planning a white and cobalt theme with lots of peonies for the wedding, which will be in Southampton and will be attended by 400.</p>
        <p>Like many florists in her position, she must weigh how long she can continue in business without making a profit on some of her biggest jobs.</p>
        <p>For Mr. Beahm, who said he lived hand to mouth despite consorting with the rich and powerful, the flower business is a dicey one indeed. ''Personally, they'll spend as little as they can get away with,'' he said, referring to the women who ask him to send bouquets to friends as thank-yous for a dinner party or to mark a birthday. ''The minimum I'll let someone get away with paying is $50, and yet they'll get a $250 bouquet. It's killing me. I have to remind these ladies all the time that I'm not the charity.''</p>
