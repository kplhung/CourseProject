        <p>Randy Schein letter deplores Max Wallace's portrayal of modern athlete in his Apr 30 article</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>I read Max Wallace's ''Today's Athletes Owe Everything to Ali'' (April 30) and was extremely dismayed at his portrayal of the modern athlete. His blatant presumptions and broad generalizations show the same narrow-mindedness he implicitly states he is fighting against.</p>
        <p>He states that today's superstar athletes carry on Ali's legacy of principles ''by shilling running shoes made under sweatshop conditions in third world countries, demonstrating a consistent example of greed and bad behavior, and by pretending the world outside sports does not exist.'' He goes on to say that athletes should be held accountable for their behavior outside the arena, to realize their impact on a significant segment of society, and he compares the ethics of today's athlete to those of Muhammad Ali.</p>

        <p>To the Sports Editor:</p>
        <p>I read Max Wallace's ''Today's Athletes Owe Everything to Ali'' (April 30) and was extremely dismayed at his portrayal of the modern athlete. His blatant presumptions and broad generalizations show the same narrow-mindedness he implicitly states he is fighting against.</p>
        <p>He states that today's superstar athletes carry on Ali's legacy of principles ''by shilling running shoes made under sweatshop conditions in third world countries, demonstrating a consistent example of greed and bad behavior, and by pretending the world outside sports does not exist.'' He goes on to say that athletes should be held accountable for their behavior outside the arena, to realize their impact on a significant segment of society, and he compares the ethics of today's athlete to those of Muhammad Ali.</p>
        <p>Wallace, in essence, says that the modern athlete is spoiled, churlish and irresponsible. This is ridiculous. By grouping the majority of athletes with a guilty few, he diminishes the good deeds that today's athlete does do. In the very same section, an article about the Toronto Raptors mentions how Antonio Davis and Charles Oakley support a day care center.</p>
        <p>Personally, I have done volunteer work for the Crohn's/Colitis Foundation with the Mets, and have been warmed by the support of many individual players. Throw in the countless athletes who donate money every time they hit a home run, the foundations started and/or supported by athletes, and the visits by players to inner city schools, and Wallace's argument does not hold water.</p>
        <p>I suggest that Wallace let athletes simply be the human beings they are, and perhaps he will not be so disappointed.</p>
