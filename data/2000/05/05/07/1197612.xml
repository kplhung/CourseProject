        <p>IT was Tuesday evening on the 6:26 in a Long Island-bound train crowded with weary commuters lurching in the aisles, elbow to elbow, briefcase to briefcase. Unfolding a newspaper was unthinkable. Flipping through a hardcover might form an instant but awkward book club of strangers.</p>
        <p>So I rummaged in my purse in search of something for just such a literary emergency. Even in a rush-hour commute there was  ample reading room for a novel stored in a Palm Pilot, which is smaller than a paperback yet mighty enough to carry 12 digital titles.</p>

        <p>IT was Tuesday evening on the 6:26 in a Long Island-bound train crowded with weary commuters lurching in the aisles, elbow to elbow, briefcase to briefcase. Unfolding a newspaper was unthinkable. Flipping through a hardcover might form an instant but awkward book club of strangers.</p>
        <p>So I rummaged in my purse in search of something for just such a literary emergency. Even in a rush-hour commute there was  ample reading room for a novel stored in a Palm Pilot, which is smaller than a paperback yet mighty enough to carry 12 digital titles.</p>
        <p>I turned to the beginning of Stephen King's novel ''The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon,'' which glowed from a screen a littler smaller than a poker card and contained 1,409 miniature pages. The train rumbling through its stops drowned out the faint cicada-like clicking -- the digital equivalent of a page-turner.</p>
        <p>For more than a year, I've been experimenting with electronic books in a personal quest to judge a book by its lack of a cover. I embarked with baggage that would sag a bookshelf: words were made to be inked. And the ultimate test of pleasure reading was the plump couch test. Could you curl up with a pillow and good byte?</p>
        <p>The various e-book devices felt like solid hardcovers in hand, but the first generation seemed stiff to me, somehow nerdy and bulky. The cold gray screens of text didn't offer the hypnotic calm of vanilla rag paper.</p>
        <p>Reading books on a PC felt too much like I was working, chained upright to a desk. There was a reason why there was a paperback revolution. I was drawn to the devices that offered one of the basic elements of pocketbook design: portability.</p>
        <p>My first attempt was a mystery about a rakish serial killer, which Penguin Putnam had offered as a teaser in an early version of the Rocket eBook. The monochromatic text and page of the reading device already seems a little primitive given the plans to transform it by Gemstar. Since Penguin sent out only one chapter, I still don't know whether the book was a click-turner.</p>
        <p>I have ordered titles from Zero Heure in Paris, a new electronic publisher that delivers books in e-mail attachments, which can be read on a computer or printed out. The books are the latest from France and discounted as much as 30 percent.</p>
        <p>I've charged brief works of electronica from the bookseller Fatbrain.com -- which has now transformed into MightyWords. One was an illustrated children's book in the Chocolate-Covered Banana series featuring a monkey named Tyco, which I submitted to a tough critic, my 3-year-old daughter. There was something gloriously democratic about ordering a title simply written and posted by three children from the San Diego area. Anyone can publish on MightyWorks -- for better or worse.</p>
        <p>But it was Stephen King who forced me to squeeze a book into my Palm Pilot. His e-novella, ''Riding the Bullet,'' was unavailable from Amazon.com, Barnesandnoble.com and the other booksellers that were overwhelmed by demand on the first day that the title was offered free.</p>
        <p>To my great surprise, it was not uncomfortable to read a book by clicking through page after page on the Palm Pilot's tiny screen, which displays about one paragraph in large type. It takes a while to grow accustomed to devouring a novel on a device more commonly used to scan telephone numbers and calendars. The contrast of the text and page on the screen seemed too dark for hours of reading. It was also a laborious effort to peck out notes on its tiny keyboard.</p>
        <p>BUT on the other hand, I could enlarge the text, making it much easier on my eyes. By thinking of the small screen of text as something akin to a newspaper column, I could adjust to the notion of reading this way. Still, my mind wandered, and at night on the couch I reached gratefully for a hardcover.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, Microsoft has splashily released its own version of an electronic reader, which illustrates the relentless if not rapid progress taking place in this market. The text is in color with much clearer resolution than the less expensive Palm Pilot, but the price is daunting for a charter member of the paperback generation: $500.</p>
        <p>Still to come are Gemstar's new prototypes of the eRocket book and the SoftBook, which it is manufacturing for the fall in partnership with the French electronics maker Thomson Multimedia. Henry Yuen, Gemstar's chief executive, is visiting New York publishing suites with the second-generation prototype of the SoftBook, a slim 22-ounce version featuring a paperback-sized screen, color text, a 50-book capacity and a stylus that can jot down and erase notes. The price hasn't been set yet.</p>
        <p>Till then I content myself with Microsoft's offering. Standing on the train, I set aside my Palm Pilot and check through the Microsoft bookshelf, clicking through the Hans Christian Andersen's classics ''The Emperor's New Clothes'' and ''The Match Girl.''</p>
        <p>The naked emperor failed to maintain my attention, but perhaps that story seemed all too familiar. The true test of e-book devices is whether a reader can plunge into another world with abandon. And for a few pages that retreat came with the scenes of the little match girl, who gave me a chill as I imagined her dying on a street corner, her frozen hands gripping spent matches.</p>
        <p>I had forgotten the device in my hand and no longer heard the burr of strange clicks.</p>
