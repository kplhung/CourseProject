        <p>HOMEBUYERS know that they are often required to pay several thousand dollars in closing costs to complete the deal.

        <p>HOMEBUYERS know that they are often required to pay several thousand dollars in closing costs to complete the deal. But while the types and amounts of those costs are usually predictable, real estate experts say that buyers of apartments in New York City -- particularly when the apartment is in a recent conversion or a newly constructed building -- may be in for some unpleasant surprises.</p>
        <p>''It's quite easy to see your costs for purchasing in a conversion jump $15,000 to $30,000 over what you expected to pay,'' said Stephen Kliegerman, director of downtown sales for the Halstead Property Company in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kliegerman said that in most cases, the increased costs come from the fact that developers and sponsors often include provisions in the contract or the offering plan making the buyer pay real-property transfer taxes to the city and the state.</p>
        <p>In a typical transaction, he said, the buyer is expected to pay costs that may include the buyer's lawyer's fees, mortgage-application fees, mortgage points, property-appraisal fees, document-filing fees, hazard-insurance premiums, title-insurance premiums, pest-inspection charges, surveyor's fees, overnight-delivery fees and other charges and taxes.</p>
        <p>And while brokers and real estate lawyers are generally able to provide clients with a fairly accurate estimate of what the charges will be, Mr. Kliegerman said, there are times when even the experts fail to advise their clients about the costs that can be associated with buying an apartment in a recently converted or newly constructed building.</p>
        <p>The New York State transfer tax, Mr. Kliegerman said, is $2 for every $500 of the gross purchase price. The New York City transfer tax, he said, is 1 percent of the purchase price for properties sold for $500,000 or less, and 1.425 percent of the entire purchase price for properties that sell for more. In a standard residential real-estate transaction, he said, the seller pays both taxes. In transactions involving new conversions or new construction, he said, the sponsor or developer almost always passes the costs along to the buyer.</p>
        <p>''There's just no avoiding these cost pass-throughs,'' Mr. Kliegerman said, adding that while virtually all elements of a real estate transaction are negotiable, developers and sponsors typically insist that buyers agree to pay the state and local transfer taxes. ''Its one of the realities of the tight supply and huge demand in today's real estate market,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kliegerman said that with many new condominium apartments in Manhattan selling for upward of $1 million, the transfer taxes could be substantial. The state and city transfer taxes on an apartment that sells for $1 million, he said, would amount to $4,000 and $14,250 respectively, a total of $18,250.</p>
        <p>''The better brokers and lawyers counsel their clients about this so they can figure the extra costs into their budgets,'' Mr. Kliegerman said. ''But stories of buyers getting really upset when they hear about these costs for the first time right before the closing are fairly common.''</p>
        <p>Stanley Simon, a Manhattan real estate lawyer, said that another traditional seller's cost that is passed along to the buyer -- again, primarily in new construction and new conversions -- is the seller's legal fees.</p>
        <p>''The buyers can always say to the seller: 'You can pay your own legal fees,' '' Mr. Simon said. ''But then the seller can then turn around and say: 'Well, then, I'll just have to find another buyer.' ''</p>
        <p>An even more frustrating experience for some buyers, he said, is not finding out until just before the closing that the buyer is paying the seller's lawyer.</p>
        <p>''I've seen cases where lawyers who represent buyers in a new conversion apparently never read the fine print that requires the buyer to pay the legal fees of the sponsor,'' Mr. Simon said, adding that such fees can be as much as $1,000.</p>
        <p>Less expensive, but just as frustrating, he said, are various ''nuisance'' fees that buyers are sometimes required to pay according to the terms of many sponsors' and developers' contracts.</p>
        <p>''One thing you see a lot are extra fees for holding the closing anywhere other than the sponsor's lawyer's office,'' he said, explaining that such a charge can range from $250 to $600, and sometimes even more. ''And the charge is imposed even if the closing is just two or three blocks away.''</p>
        <p>Another fairly common provision in contracts for condominium units in a new building or a new conversion, Mr. Simon said, requires the buyer to use the sponsor's title company or pay the sponsor an additional $200 or so. ''The reason for that provision is that the title company that handled the conversion is familiar with all the legal issues relating to the property,'' he said, explaining that if a different title company is used by the buyer, the sponsor or his lawyer will have the extra work of providing documents and explanations that have already been given to the sponsor's title company.</p>
        <p>Bruce Cholst, a Manhattan co-op lawyer, said that even sellers of existing apartments are starting to try to pass along to buyers at least some of the costs of the sale.</p>
        <p>''The first thing that comes to mind are flip taxes,'' Mr. Cholst said, explaining that some co-op proprietary leases require a shareholder who is selling an apartment to pay a specified amount to the co-op corporation upon the sale. ''The standard flip tax is calculated as a percentage of the sale price,'' Mr. Cholst said.  ''And I've seen flip taxes that amount to tens of thousands of dollars.''</p>
        <p>And while the buyer has no legal obligation to pay the flip tax imposed on the seller by the co-op, he said, more and more sellers are trying to pass the cost along to the buyer as a condition of the sale.</p>
        <p>''Whether the buyer agrees to the seller's terms usually depends on the existing market conditions and the general anxiety level of the buyer,'' Mr. Cholst said. ''And in today's market, buyers are pretty anxious.''</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding such anxiety, it may still pay for a buyer to leave the bargaining in the hands of his lawyer.</p>
        <p>''Most sellers want you to think that these kinds of clauses are non-negotiable,'' Mr. Simon said. ''But if a lawyer is any good at haggling, he might still be able to save his client enough money to cover his own legal bill.''</p>
