        <p>While organizers of the Million Mom March expect at least 200,000 people in Washington on Mother's Day to call for stricter gun control efforts, Westchester will hold its own version in Chappaqua, where marchers will hear an 8-year-old Larchmont girl's call for action.</p>
        <p>''I just want to tell you, I don't like living in a country or a world where people shoot other people.''

        <p>''I just want to tell you, I don't like living in a country or a world where people shoot other people.'' That is what Katie Feller, a third grader at the Chatsworth School, said she would tell the Chappaqua gathering. ''Also it isn't fair that a lot of innocent people get shot, even children.''</p>
        <p>Katie said she was moved to act by her synagogue after the shooting in Michigan of a first grader by a schoolmate earlier this year. She has been circulating petitions as well as asking classmates to sign pledges that they would stay away from guns. ''If this world were civilized we would be able to settle things by talking,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The march in Chappaqua came about because ''we realized there were a lot of people who really wanted to have a say in this and were unable to go to D.C.,'' said Barbara Offenhartz, a coordinator of the event, which will begin at 8 a.m. at the train station and will follow a route of about one-half mile.</p>
