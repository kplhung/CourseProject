        <p>LOVE, Acclaim and Greed.'' So goes the producing director Lewis Arlt's summing up of a new play at Fleetwood Stage here. Under that headline in his program notes, he explains it all for us, or tries to. These ''easily recognizable folks we might meet in our own family,'' Mr. Arlt writes, are ''looking for secure relationships, successful careers, monetary ease.''</p>
        <p>Inspired by the direction of a Feydeau farce in which Mr. Arlt and Nelson Sheeley, the founders of Fleetwood, once acted together, Mr. Arlt recalls how that production united ''a powerfully grounded sense of reality with the desperate longings of people seized by stress.''</p>
        <p>Now, some 28 years later, Mr. Sheeley has written his own piece of allegedly comic madness, which he calls, unfathomably, '' . . . and call me in the morning.'' Yes, a young male medical student is a main character. His name, Kim, works whether he is in or out of drag. And, yes, a real doctor makes a brief appearance to retrieve a life-size plastic cast of a head made for instructional purposes, but found in a shopping bag and misconstrued to be a real dead head -- chopped off, that is.</p>
        <p>One hesitates to call it a dummy because that could describe any one of Mr. Sheeley's six, full-bodied, though thoroughly stock, characters.</p>
        <p>Actually, there is a benevolent seventh, a policewoman, no dummy, welcomely arriving near the end of the second act -- not soon enough, but in time to bring in a fresh voice and handcuffs, to put the play to rest and walk off with the acting honors of this flabbergasting nonoccasion. It is important to note that Valerie diLorenzo gives that enlivening no-nonsense, no-dummy cameo performance.</p>
        <p>Whether doctors still tell you to take two aspirins, or whatever, and call them in the morning, is beside the point, or perhaps the archaic, borscht-belt coyness of the cliche is precisely to the point. What's in this title is simply a reflection of random witlessness. The playwright is  presumably attempting to adhere to the mandates of farce: stretching the basically believable to the point of absurdity, as Mr. Arlt puts it. But Mr. Sheeley's premise is beyond belief. He fails to differentiate between true absurdity and utter inanity. He does not write funny lines. He does write extremely tasteless and sophomoric ones.</p>
        <p>Concealing inspiration, though neither desperation nor stress, Mr. Arlt is the director. His smooth analysis of his own as well as the playwright's utterly failed intentions could serve as a primer for  publicists on the art of the con, or in a regional theater context, the  stratagem of the artistic con. It would be useful for audience members to contemplate Mr. Arlt's drum-beating program notes before the performance; they could be otherwise clueless.</p>
        <p>For the Fleetwood, so-called farce is as far removed from a real Feydeau farce as Wildcliff Drive is from the Comedie Francaise. And it is as much about narcolepsy, mistaken decapitation and homophobia as it is about what Mr. Arlt perceives as people's ''quite natural urge to control the world.'' What?</p>
        <p>Mr. Sheeley cranks out plot convolutions, out of control yet simple and predictable enough to follow, involving an obscene telephone caller, the 89-year-old transvestite in Apartment 1B; Henry, the ''gay gourmet'' and model (that head could be his headshot) next door; and his boyfriend du jour. Doesn't everybody have a good-looking gay neighbor who cooks? Then there's the chubby little man who preys on rich elderly widows. He's the ''narco cat burglar,'' who has only a few hours to prove that Kim is really a boy. Kim is heterosexual. When Scotch is served to Kim and Henry, someone -- don't ask who -- wants to know ''which of you is the straight one?''</p>
        <p>Before long -- no, after a very  long time -- Kim must pretend to be a deaf mute, which the actor John Stanisci and Mr. Arlt appear to confuse with severe mental and physical impairment. Kim's fiancee, Susan, is addicted to both diet and ''elephant pills,'' a muscle relaxant prescribed for an obese friend.</p>
        <p>Given his chance to act the Southern belle, Henry does double damage to Amanda Wingfield and Scarlett O'Hara. If Mr. Sheeley has not attended to the niceties of farce construction, at least he has reveled in the coarseness of multi-leveled offensiveness.</p>
        <p>'' . . . and call me in the morning,'' produced by Fleetwood Stage, 44 Wildcliff Drive, New Rochelle. Scheduled performances through next Sunday; the run may be extended a week. Box office: 654-8949.</p>
