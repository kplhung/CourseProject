        <p>ALTHOUGH the Walt Disney Company received some relief from the Federal Communications Commission in its battle against Time Warner over ABC programming, Disney has taken its fight to another important arena: the cities and towns across America that control local cable franchises.</p>
        <p>Realizing that every city could become a pressure point, Disney executives have met with dozens of city officials to urge them to make changes in the franchise agreements with Time Warner when it merges with America Online.</p>
        <p>In meetings last week, Disney advised local cable authorities to write specific language into those agreements to ensure that a combined AOL-Time Warner does not favor its own cable channels over those of rival programming providers. This is important to Disney, which wants to move its Disney Channel from a premium service to the basic lineup and wants to operate a cartoon channel that would compete with Time Warner's Cartoon Network.</p>
        <p>Disney, parent of ABC, also suggested Time Warner be required to open its cable lines to competing Internet service providers.</p>
        <p>While the F.C.C. has broad authority over cable operators, cities have the right to approve or reject any transfer of a franchise. The merger has created an opportunity for local government to seek changes that could advance the interests of Disney and add protections for consumers.</p>
        <p>''Today it's ABC; tomorrow it could be somebody else,'' said Alex Padilla, a Los Angeles city councilman, who met with Disney officials. Mr. Padilla helps oversee the city's Information Technology Agency, one of 30,000 cable franchise authorities nationwide. The agency is responsible for a host of cable issues, including rates, what bills look like and how quickly a cable operator responds to customer calls.</p>
        <p>Mr. Padilla said Time Warner violated its franchise agreement with Los Angeles by stopping transmission of the ABC network without properly notifying the city's 180,000 subscribers. The city council expects to vote in the next month on whether to approve the transfer of the Time Warner franchise to AOL.</p>
        <p>Time Warner, however, denies that any agreement was violated, and said it had notified customers via on-screen messages on its cable channels for four months. It has also said it will compensate customers for the service interruption.</p>
        <p>Michael Luftman, a spokesman for Time Warner Cable, said the company did not believe that Disney would influence the cities. ''Parties in a business negotiation often seek to gain leverage in a variety of ways, and it has to be seen in that light,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Andrew Schwartzman, president of the Media Access Project, a nonprofit advocacy group, said more cities are taking a cue from Portland, Ore., which won approval in federal court last year to require AT&amp;T to open its cable lines as part of its purchase of the cable company MediaOne Group. ''This can be viewed,'' he said, ''as a very important early skirmish in a much larger war over the very character of the Internet and the availability of services to consumers.''</p>
        <p>BY law, cable companies are required to pay 5 percent of gross revenues generated in each city in franchise fees. Last year, for example, they paid the city of Los Angeles $17.5 million in fees, and the fees are expected to increase to more than $20 million this year, Mr. Padilla said.</p>
        <p>Paul Glist, a communications industry lawyer in Washington, said: ''The franchises are quite lucrative for municipalities. There are many communities where the cable television franchise fee is what allows the city to function. They couldn't balance their budgets without it.''</p>
        <p>But he said cities are limited in their scope over cable companies. ''The F.C.C. specifically said the transfer process cannot be used as a subterfuge to do things over which the F.C.C. has exclusive control,'' he said.</p>
