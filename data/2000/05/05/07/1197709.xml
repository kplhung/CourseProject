        <p>The dispute between the Walt Disney Company and Time Warner Cable that blacked out ABC television for about 1.8 million New Yorkers on Monday and Tuesday provided an unexpected business opportunity to a small telecommunications company based in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>The company, Residential Communications Networks, is one of the few alternatives to Time Warner Cable in New York City, where competition for the television industry has long been limited by the high costs of building alternative systems and the reception problems that tall buildings pose for satellite providers.</p>
        <p>''As you can imagine, our telephones have been ringing off their hooks, from people who want to switch their cable service,'' David C.  McCourt, the chairman and chief executive of RCN, said in an interview last week.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCourt, said that people started calling his company, whose services include cable and satellite, in the hours after Time Warner removed WABC in a dispute with the broadcast station's parent company, Disney, over retransmission fees at 12:01 a.m. Monday.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCourt contended that the blackout would never have happened if Time Warner faced real competition in New York City.</p>
        <p>New Yorkers get cable service from Time Warner or Cablevision, depending on where they live. The two companies do not directly compete in any area.</p>
        <p>Except for the much smaller Liberty Cable in Manhattan, the two companies used to be the only licensed cable providers in New York City, operating as government-sanctioned monopolies. But the passage of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996 permitted some competition and removed some regulatory controls.</p>
        <p>And while Time Warner and Disney have come up with an agreement -- at least until the new July 15 negotiations deadline -- and the cable provider has offered a two-day rebate for its subscribers, the ABC blackout has spawned new concern about a lack of real competition in the cable industry.</p>
        <p>Chris Meyer, executive director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, acknowledged cable companies ''have gotten a free ride from groups like mine,'' but added, ''those days are over, with prices going up and this active war on consumers.''He and other consumer advocates said they feared the potential dominance of the companies, if cable lines become the popular conduit for television, Internet and cable services.</p>
        <p>Companies like RCN were seen as the potential competitors that would bring down cable prices and spur more innovation after the passage of the Telecommunications Act. But that has been slow to happen, government officials acknowledged and consumer advocates said.</p>
        <p>Mark Cooper, the executive director of the Consumer Federation, a Washington advocacy group, said that ''given the economics of splitting the cable market,'' possible competitors are ''just not interested in coming into New York or any other major metropolitan area with high costs.''</p>
        <p>In many other parts of the country satellite television has emerged as a competitor to cable service. However, in Manhattan and many parts of the Bronx, Brooklyn and Queens, densely packed and tall buildings interfere with satellite television signals.</p>
        <p>RCN appears to have found a way around both the infrastructure and building interference problems. From 1991 to 1996, Time Warner and Liberty Cable waged a David-and-Goliath battle for cable-television customers in Manhattan. By 1996, despite a strategy that focused on large apartment buildings in affluent neighborhoods, Liberty was only able to sign up just 34,000 customers.</p>
        <p>In 1996, RCN acquired Liberty's network and began putting satellite dishes on other buildings where interference is not an issue.</p>
        <p>RCN officials hope to use the Liberty system as a foundation for their own citywide network. They hope to get around the high cost of building their own network by using Liberty's existing system and bundling services together, including cable, telephone and Internet offerings. In this way, company officials said, RCN would be able to use the same infrastructure to take a share of each of those markets. Company officials would not comment on the number of its subscribers in New York.</p>
        <p>But industry analysts said that RCN has taken a path that will have serious limitations. For example, in seeking to sell the most profit-yielding telecommunications package,  RCN may find itself restricted to upper-income areas, where people often have telephone, cable and Internet access, and tend to spend a lot on telecommunications.</p>
