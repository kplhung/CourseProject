        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Is it Sarah Vowell's fault that Rick Marin hates public radio? Marin apparently thinks so, since his review of Vowell's book of essays, ''Take the Cannoli'' (April 9), is more a diatribe against NPR than a proper book review. Public radio, Marin is eager to tell us, is so irritating and boring, its contents so self-indulgent, that by association Vowell's book must be the same. But who's really the irritating, boring, self-indulgent one? Vowell? Or Marin, who devotes half his review to ripping apart Vowell's character and the other half to everything we never wanted to know about the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation?</p>
