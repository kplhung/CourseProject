        <p>FOR 21 years, hotshot thoroughbreds barreled into Louisville with lofty reputations and great expectations of conquering the Kentucky Derby.</p>
        <p>They failed, one by one, year after year. Some were blown away by the magnitude of the Derby; some were tripped up by fate's unpleasant mood.</p>
        <p>Arazi: finished a dull eighth in 1992, a shadow of his dazzling performance in winning the 1991 Breeders' Cup Juvenile.</p>
        <p>Holy Bull: squeezed at the start, he ended up 14th on a muddy track in 1994.</p>
        <p>A. P. Indy: withdrawn on Derby morning with a bruised hoof in 1992, the year of Arazi's failure.</p>
        <p>Yesterday the favorite finally broke through. Fusaichi Pegasus, the 3-year-old who cost his owner an astounding $4 million as a yearling, smashed the Derby jinx with a come-from-behind victory. In a traffic jam of a field that defines the Derby, Fusaichi Pegasus glided, wove in and out, and finally exploded down the stretch.</p>
        <p>This is the first Derby champion of the millennium, and if there is a lesson to take away, it may be one of speed, power and luck.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Fusao Sekiguchi, the hip-looking owner with tinted glasses and a ponytail, said he saw the Derby jinx as a challenge. ''I thrive on challenges,'' he said. ''Everyone told me about the jinx. I wanted to meet it.''</p>
        <p>They talk about bloodlines and pedigree, training regimen and temperament. The element that made this race so hard on favorites, dashed so many dreams, was the unpredictable but mandatory element of luck. Unearned, unexpected luck.</p>
        <p>''The fact that you have so many horses, that's why favorites don't win,'' the trainer Billy Ashenbrenner said. ''A 20-horse field is a joke. You can't pick a winner out of a 20-horse field, any way, shape or form. The horse that wins it is lucky. And with a 20-horse field, it's mostly bad luck.''</p>
        <p>Luck. You hear that word a lot in horse racing. Spend $4 million on a horse, as Sekiguchi did, and you rely on luck?</p>
        <p>''Any time you put the large number of horses in a gate and they have to go as far as they're going, so many things can transpire that it's hard to predict who the winner is going to be,'' the trainer Robbie O'Connor said. ''You need a lot of luck.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday the trainer Neil Drysdale conceded the role fortune played in his horse's victory. ''In a 20-horse field, you do need the racing gods to be smiling on you somewhat,'' he said.</p>
        <p>In a critical part of the race, Fusaichi Pegasus moved inside War Chant and found himself in a pocket of horses. If the pocket did not move, the horse could not move. But as soon the jockey Kent Desormeaux moved in the pocket, the field quickened.</p>
        <p>This was luck, but it was also prescience. Every time they moved from a turn, the pack in front would peel away, providing a fortuitous corridor. ''That happened all the way to the quarter pole,'' Desormeaux said. Ultimately, there were no more tiers, just two more horses. The jockey asked for one more acceleration and Fusaichi Pegasus exploded down the stretch. ''It was over at that point,'' Desormeaux said. ''He took off like the best horse I've been involved with at this stage of the game.''</p>
        <p>But anything can happen. Last week Fusaichi Pegasus threw his exercise rider and fell down. Neither was injured. Luckily.</p>
        <p>''All of them are taken care of very well,'' O'Connor said. ''Yet you can come in here one morning -- all they have to do is take one bad step and that $2 million, $4 million investment is not worth an egg sandwich.''</p>
        <p>Doc Danner, an agent who represents jockeys, said, ''I've been around here a long time, and everyone I've ever talked to says this is the hardest race in the world to win.''</p>
        <p>Then there's Churchill Downs itself. The scene alone can intimidate the inexperienced rider.</p>
        <p>''There's something about the Derby -- it's the way the race develops -- it takes a lot of luck,'' the jockey Tracy Hebert said. ''Having a good trip, breaking good, staying out of trouble, cutting corners, not having to go around the whole field. Some horses just don't run here as good as they run at Belmont. It's got nothing to do with the favorite not winning, just the horse.</p>
        <p>''It could be the crowd, it could be the noise. Who knows? Nobody knows. This track is a hard track; a horse weighs 1,500 pounds. That's pretty big to be hitting on the hard ground. If they get to stinging, not comfortable, they won't put out. At Belmont, along the stretch, the track is deeper and the speed will back up a little bit. Here the speed won't back up. You got to be in contention unless you got a real, real good horse that will come from way out of it.</p>
        <p>''It seems like this is a big track, but you get 20 horses in a race and you got to maneuver and come around, before you know it, the wire's there. At Belmont, the track is huge. You've got plenty, plenty room, a long stretch; the racetrack's a little deeper.''</p>
        <p>The Derby has come and gone, and questions remain. Can you buy a Derby victory? Can you breed a champion? At least on this day, with a $4 million horse, the answer is yes.</p>
        <p>''Once you spend that kind of money for a horse, your percentages go way up,'' O'Connor said, ''because you are buying the pedigree and a horse that's already proven he can run some. But there's a lot to be said for luck in this game, too.</p>
        <p>''You can have the big money to spend; you better have the luck also following it.''</p>
        <p>Yesterday luck met design and preparation and shattered a curse.</p>
