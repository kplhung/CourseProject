        <p>The wife of a prosperous Russian businessman killed her husband in their lavish Staten Island home, had her boyfriend help her dump the body, then took her children on a vacation to Disney World before reporting her husband missing, the police said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The woman, Elena Kiejliches, 34, was arrested Friday and charged with second-degree murder in the killing of Borys Kiejliches, 49, who was found in a cardboard barrel in a marsh near the Belt Parkway on the Brooklyn-Queens border on April 25, said William H. Allee, the chief of detectives. Mr. Kiejliches had been shot once in the head with a large-caliber pistol and his hands had been tied, Chief Allee said. He had been dead for some time when his body was discovered, the chief added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kiejliches's $125,000 Mercedes-Benz had been found at the end of Coney Island Avenue, near the Brighton Beach boardwalk, three weeks earlier, the chief said. He was last seen on March 28, a week before that, near his home at 91 East Loop Road, in the Todt Hill section of Staten Island, a wealthy neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kiejliches, who had been married to the victim for eight years, had reported her husband missing, Chief Allee said, but detectives were ''extremely suspicious'' about the circumstances of Mr. Kiejliches's disappearance. Ms. Kiejliches had refused to talk to investigators about her husband's disappearance and had hired a lawyer, the police said.</p>
        <p>The case was investigated by detectives from Staten Island and Queens homicide squads and will be prosecuted on Staten Island, because investigators believe that the killing took place in the basement of the couple's home, law enforcement officials said.</p>
        <p>A Brooklyn man officials identified as Ms. Kiejliches's boyfriend was also arrested in connection with the killing. Chief Allee said the man, Messiah Justice, 26, had helped Ms. Kiejliches dispose of her husband's body. He described Mr. Justice as an aspiring rap artist.</p>
        <p>One official said Mr. Justice often stayed at the couple's home while Mr. Kiejliches was away on business.</p>
        <p>Law enforcement officials said Mr. Justice, who has an arrest record dating to 1989, had made a statement to authorities in which he said Ms. Kiejliches had implicated herself in the murder.</p>
        <p>He was charged with hindering prosecution, tampering with evidence and obstructing governmental administration, Chief Allee said.</p>
        <p>Referring to the location of the bullet wound that killed Mr. Kiejliches, one official also said investigators suspect that he was shot while sleeping or lying down. The couple, the official added, had a history of domestic violence.</p>
        <p>Detectives have learned that a section of carpet was missing from the otherwise immaculately kept home, suggesting to investigators that someone removed it to conceal evidence, several officials said. The murder weapon has not been recovered.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kiejliches took the couple's two children, an 8-year-old boy and a 5-year-old girl, to Disney World just before she reported her husband missing, Chief Allee said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kiejliches had an aviation fuel business called Albo Inter Corporation, which listed his Staten Island home as its address, and was also affiliated with a dental business in Brooklyn, according to business records and a person who answered the telephone at the dental office. Chief Allee said Mr. Kiejliches spent a great deal of time in Russia on business but would not elaborate on the trips.</p>
        <p>An apparently distraught woman who answered the telephone at Mr. Kiejliches's home yesterday and identified herself as a family member would not discuss the killing or the arrest of Ms. Kiejliches.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Chief Allee also announced an arrest in the killing of another Russian immigrant, Yuri Bershadski, 32, whose naked corpse was found in a small copse of trees by the water's edge in the Eltingville section of Staten Island on April 25.</p>
        <p>The police arrested Vladimir Zuran, 38, an associate of Mr. Bershadski, on Friday in Van Nuys, Calif. The chief said the police were unsure of the motive for the killing, other than that the two men had ''had a falling out.''</p>
        <p>The police had initially suspected a connection between the two killings, because the body of Mr. Kiejliches was also found on April 25 with a single gunshot wound to the head, Chief Allee said. But detectives soon ruled out a connection, he said.</p>
