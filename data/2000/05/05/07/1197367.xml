        <p>The National Park Service is selling a new $50 pass that admits the holder, and everyone else in the same car, to all National Parks for one year from month of purchase. The Park Service put the pass on sale last month in cooperation with its nonprofit partner, the National Park Foundation. For those arriving on foot, the pass admits the purchaser, spouse, parents and children.</p>
        <p>Separate entrance fees at the most popular parks have risen in recent years. Since 1997, the top price has been for a week's  entry for a car into Yosemite, the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone-Grand Teton: $20 each. At Acadia National Park in Maine, a year's pass is $20.</p>

        <p>The National Park Service is selling a new $50 pass that admits the holder, and everyone else in the same car, to all National Parks for one year from month of purchase. The Park Service put the pass on sale last month in cooperation with its nonprofit partner, the National Park Foundation. For those arriving on foot, the pass admits the purchaser, spouse, parents and children.</p>
        <p>Separate entrance fees at the most popular parks have risen in recent years. Since 1997, the top price has been for a week's  entry for a car into Yosemite, the Grand Canyon or Yellowstone-Grand Teton: $20 each. At Acadia National Park in Maine, a year's pass is $20.</p>
        <p>When these fees were announced, the government said that the added revenue would be used to make repairs and reinstitute programs that had been lost in budget cuts. Eighty percent of the yield from the new pass will be dedicated to support programs to protect animals, rebuild trails and conduct research, the park service said.</p>
        <p>The new pass can be bought at national park visitor centers, through the Web at www.nationalparks.org or by calling (888) 467-2757. By mail, a check for $53.95, including mailing, should be made payable to National Park Service and sent to National Park Pass, 27540 Avenue Mentry, Valencia, Calif. 91355. The Golden Age Pass, which  covers all the parks for life, costs $10, and is available to people over 62. Golden Access, for the disabled, is still free.</p>
