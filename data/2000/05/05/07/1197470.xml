        <p>Jim Parker never intended to be a goat herder, nor did he ask to become a stop on the underground livestock railway for animals fleeing the local slaughterhouse.</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Parker, who owns a television production studio -- a cinder block building perched atop a steep, rocky hillside overlooking the Delaware River -- is both. And in the process, he has become something of a local hero with children.</p>
        <p>Nobody can say for certain where to find the farm that occasionally loses goats that wander across Route 295 at the Route 129 interchange. Several calls to the police, animal control officials and farms in the area produced only vague information.</p>
        <p>The police in Bordentown Township and Bordentown City say there is a farm outside  Trenton that acts as a stopping point for goats on their way to Trenton for slaughter.</p>
        <p>''We get a number of calls, two or three a month, about goats loose near 295,'' said Jim Stevenson, the police dispatcher for Bordentown Township. And Sgt. Ray McNamara, public affairs officer for the township, said that while the goats are not rampant they are a fairly common sight.</p>
        <p>''Whenever the goats get out, the farmers always come out and help locate the animals,'' said Sergeant McNamara. ''They're really nice people. The goats just make a break for it once in a while and somehow, who knows how, they find their way across the city and over to the river.''</p>
        <p>But the police in Bordentown City thought the question of stray goats wandering their streets was a prank. ''Ghosts or goats?'' one officer demanded.</p>
        <p>Mr. Parker, it seems, is a goat magnet.</p>
        <p>It began seven years ago when he took his daughter, Jaime, 9 at the time, to a 4-H Club festival, where they met a girl who was raising a goat as part of a project.</p>
        <p>''The girls made friends, and a couple of months later she called and asked if I would buy her goat and I said I really didn't need a goat,'' Mr. Parker said. ''Then she started crying and said the other people who wanted the goat intended to eat it. So there I was that afternoon driving home with this goat and wondering what I was doing.''</p>
        <p>The hillside where Mr. Parker put a pen behind his studio is goat heaven. It is there that Spuds set up housekeeping. Unfortunately, goats can get lonely. And when Mr. Parker went home for the night, Spuds voiced his displeasure until neighbors phoned and insisted that Mr. Parker either take Spuds home with him after work or get him a companion.</p>
        <p>Today, the 48-year-old Mr. Parker is the father to three children, five goats and two kids. Seven years ago, when it was just three children -- Christopher, 13, Jaime, 9, and Barbara, 5 -- he knew he would be either a hero or a cad with his decisions concerning the animal. He reluctantly chose hero.</p>
        <p>''So there I was ordering a goat from a farm,'' Mr. Parker explained. ''Of course, when we arrived at the farm we found out that the goat was one of twins and my children were horrified at the thought of separating twins.''</p>
        <p>With that, there were three goats in residence at the studio, and neighbors began to view Spuds, Darla and Alfalfa as the local attraction for children and grandchildren.</p>
        <p>Then a funny thing happened to Mr. Parker on the way to work. He heard a radio newscast about goats wandering on Route 295, and his son insisted they go on a rescue mission.</p>
        <p>''I really didn't need or want any more goats,'' Mr. Parker said, ''so I decided to wait a few days, I stalled, I suggested we go late in the evening when I was sure the goat would be gone.''</p>
        <p>No such luck. The goat was there -- and perilously close to the rushing traffic.''Do something, Dad,'' his son pleaded.</p>
        <p>So while local animal control agents worked to capture the goat, Mr. Parker  parked his minivan, hiked to the goat's  favorite haunt and plied it with bread. After two months of patient feedings, he had the goat, Caramel, eating out of his hand.</p>
        <p>''I grabbed it by the horns and hauled it into my lap,'' he said. Then he carried the goat a quarter-mile to the van and drove it to its new home.</p>
        <p>That was not the end of the story. About a year ago, Darla and Alfalfa begat Chloe. Then the really strange things began to happen. Goats began to make their way to the Parker pen.</p>
        <p>''One morning there was this goat on the outside of the fence looking longingly over as I fed the others breakfast,'' Mr. Parker explained. ''The goat -- now called Cocoa --  was there at lunch and dinner and by the next morning it had dug a hole and wiggled under the fence and joined the gang.''</p>
        <p>Caramel died in December, but miraculously the number of goats stubbornly refused to decrease. Next came Casper, who followed Cocoa's example by tunneling under the fence. And just recently Mr. Parker got a call from a woman who told him her father had recently died.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'Oh I'm sorry to hear that,' and of course her next words were, 'and he had these goats' '' Mr. Parker said, shaking his head and sighing. ''So I suppose that any day now there will be two more.''</p>
        <p>Rita Bartolomei, 60, who lives at the top of the hill overlooking the studio, said, ''We love the goats.'' Her three grandchildren,</p>
        <p>Christina, 8, Nicholas, 5, and Brandon and Shawn, 6-year-old twins, from Trenton, are  regular visitors.</p>
        <p>''Those goats are fat because my grandchildren can't visit without seeing the 'goats and boats' down the hill and feeding them all the bread in my kitchen,'' Ms. Bartolomei said with a laugh.</p>
