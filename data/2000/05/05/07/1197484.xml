        <p>It is hardly unusual that a politician would want to enact tougher gun laws. It's not so unusual that he is willing to invite greater federal control over enforcement of firearm laws, and it is certainly not unusual that he should have ambitions for higher office.</p>
        <p>But what is a shocker of sorts is that this particular gun-controlling, fed-inviting ambitious politician is a Republican.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, Donald T. DiFrancesco, the Senate President and unannounced candidate for governor, introduced a package of gun-control measures that he wants to add to the catalog of state laws that already make New Jersey one of the toughest places in the country for gun owners. Mr. DiFrancesco's proposals would limit handgun sales in the future to smart guns, called that because they recognize their owners; he would require ballistics fingerprinting of each gun sold, and he would appropriate $5 million to hire lawyers to prosecute gun-toting felons under federal laws, which are harsher than state statutes.</p>
        <p>Since smart gun technology does not even exist yet, critics of Mr. DiFrancesco -- and they tend to be Republican -- maintain that he wants to ban all handguns. He says that is not so, but it doesn't really matter. What is important to him is that by getting out ahead of his party on gun control, Mr. DiFrancesco has inoculated himself against criticism of his party from Democrats when he runs for governor next year, and that his move costs him nothing within his party.</p>
        <p>How come? Some history. Early in his term as governor, Jim Florio enacted his ban on assault weapons, which outlawed certain automatic weapons with high-capacity magazines. Gun owners saw the bill as creeping confiscationism and extracted from the Republicans a pledge to repeal the measure. When the Republicans took over both houses with veto-proof majorities in 1991, in the aftermath of Mr. Florio's  $2.8 billion tax increase, the Legislature did repeal the gun ban, and Mr. Florio promptly vetoed the repeal. The Assembly then overrode the veto and the measure went to the Senate, where Mr. DiFrancesco was newly installed as president.</p>
        <p>The Assembly Republicans, having stuck their necks out in defense of guns, waited for Mr. DiFrancesco to act. The gun owners waited for Mr. DiFrancesco to act. As the furor over the override mounted, Mr. DiFrancesco dithered, then let the issue die. The assault weapon law still stands, and Mr. DiFrancesco's name is mud among members of the gun community.</p>
        <p>So why should he care if his new gun legislation angers them? They would not vote for him in a Republican gubernatorial primary anyway.</p>
        <p>People worried about guns, on the other hand, might, and the polls suggest that in the aftermath of the spate of recent school shootings, they constitute a large and emerging bloc that clearly crosses party lines. A poll taken in October by Rutgers University showed that 81 percent of respondents believed that law governing the sale of guns should be more strict, that 87 percent agreed that the minimum age of gun ownership should be raised to 21 from 18, something Mr. DiFrancesco's proposed measures would do -- and that 73 percent said it was more important to control gun ownership than to protect owners' rights under the Second Amendment.</p>
        <p>Amazingly, 46 percent of respondents even favored banning the sale and possession of all handguns in New Jersey, a step so drastic and probably unconstitutional that even gun-control groups shy away from proposing it.</p>
        <p>It is true, as the gun lobby points out, that when it comes to polls about firearms, much depends on how the question is posed. Ask, for example, if it is more important to enforce existing laws than add new ones, and a majority will say yes. But however the numbers break out, Mr. DiFrancesco's inititiative seems keyed to the new mood of grave concern about guns not only in the state but nationwide. Just listen to the women organizing for the Million Mom March against gun violence in Washington next Sunday.</p>
        <p>Critics of Mr. DiFrancesco's proposed legislation will speak out against the bills at Thursday's hearings, and while they will reserve most of their arguments for the proposal mandating non-existing and possibly never-existing smart guns, they will also complain that the Senate President's proposed measures rerpresent an incremental attack on their constitutional right to bear arms.</p>
        <p>In this they should feel right at home with people at the opposite ends of the spectrum, the abortion rights forces. Like the gun owners, abortion rights advocates prefer to see their right as absolute -- no limits and no waiting periods. Mr. DiFrancesco, obviously believing that there are more votes in the gradualist camp that in the absolutist one, is betting that he will be able to turn his support for gun control measures into a plurality when the time comes.</p>
