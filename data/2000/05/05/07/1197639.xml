        <p>When Mel Hamill moved to New York from Dublin, he spent time working at the Gap before recognizing that there was a niche to be filled in Celtic jewelry. He began importing jewelry and small gifts with Celtic designs for sale at flea markets in New York. After four years, he set up his silver rings ($12 to $22), jewelry boxes (about $18 to $50) and silk scarves (about $24 to $42), at a kiosk in the Willowbrook Mall in Wayne, N.J. Last month, two years later, Mr. Hamill opened a Manhattan store, Tulla Celtic Designs, at 201 East 34th Street (at Third Avenue).</p>
        <p>''I always wanted to get a spot in Manhattan,'' he said.</p>
