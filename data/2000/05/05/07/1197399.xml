        <p>IF critical adulation made a career, James Yarsky, a singer-songwriter from Huntington, would be bigger than the Backstreet Boys. While those who have seen his intense performances or have heard his award-winning 1996 debut, ''Big Dead Waltz,'' rave about his artistry, there are still many who have never heard of him.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the latter includes the record company executives and music publishers he needs for success. But the 39-year-old singer -- who writes about bloody bathtubs, sinking ships and interspecies marriage (along with beautiful love songs and sweet lullabies) -- hopes to change that, as he prepares to record his highly anticipated sophomore CD.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yarsky's songs come from a murky place, no doubt influenced by his hard-knock Pittsburgh youth with a severely depressed alcoholic father and a chronically ill mother, both of whom have since died. ''She was the most extreme case of rheumatoid arthritis they had seen,'' he recalled. ''She was on her deathbed every year.''</p>
        <p>Recently, a songwriting colleague told Mr. Yarsky about her own rough childhood, saying that at least she got some good songs out of it. Mr. Yarsky cursed her, saying: ''Who gives a damn about great songs. I'd rather have had a happy childhood. My life was like an E.R.''</p>
        <p>Personal faith, a 12-step program and eventually Quakerism led him out of his nightmare. ''My first 25 years was like a blur,'' Mr. Yarsky said. ''I had faith in Jesus, I just didn't understand what Jesus had to do with the dogma. Everyone was telling me, 'If you prayed for your mother she'd get better.' I needed a different kind of Jesus.''</p>
        <p>So he played guitar and wrote songs to escape his surroundings. ''I played a lot of angry music,'' he said. ''I listened to the Who a lot.''</p>
        <p>At 19, he married his high school sweetheart, and five years later they had a daughter, Caitlin, now 14. They moved to Brooklyn, but soon divorced. In 1994, he married Kathleen O' Neill, an actress. Eighteen months ago, they had a son, Ned.</p>
        <p>In his mid-20's, his music began to change, evolving from wanting to front a band to enjoying a more introspective solo career. ''Hearing Tom Waits's 'Blue Valentine' was life-changing,'' he said. ''I started writing pretty solid songs then.''</p>
        <p>But it is his live performance where one truly sees the magic of James Yarsky. And after that experience, it is difficult to hear his music the same way again.</p>
        <p>He incorporates an acting technique called communion. ''I try to pretend I've never heard the songs before, that they're just occurring to me when I sing them,'' he explained. ''If I do it right, it seems like I'm surprised, which I am. I look into the audience for someone who will look back at me and be there with me. I try to find out what's going on between us. Every time it's different.''</p>
        <p>This technique can have profound results. In a run-down Huntington bar, he went too far. He was singing his song ''Sanctuary,'' when he became lost in it. During the chorus, his voice became gravelly and he kept repeating the line ''How can we save her? How can we save her?'' over and over again.</p>
        <p>''I loved the song,'' he said. ''I thought it was about Charles Laughton's Quasimodo saving Esmerelda. I always try to save people. I loved the way the song sounded, but I really had no idea of what it meant.''</p>
        <p>What he was actually singing about suddenly occurred to him and he began shaking. He broke down, just barely finishing the song. He had a visceral, violent reaction to the song he now realized was about his mother.</p>
        <p>Almost anytime you catch a performance, you will witness a similar intensity. One emcee introduced him to an audience by advising them to ''Put on your seat belts.''</p>
        <p>Despite the darkness in some of his songs, Mr. Yarsky (who won two Long Island Music Awards, including one for Best Songwriter on an Independent Label) can be hysterically funny. Even in the most intense songs, there's humor. The severity rests only in his past and the music that chronicles it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Yarsky's interests have moved beyond his own music. Last year, with fellow musicians Mark Hubbard and Tom Griffith, he founded 600 LBS, a Smithtown production company. They have recorded four albums by local musicians and have contracts for four others. They have also begun negotiating with well-known artists, Mr. Yarsky said.</p>
        <p>But now Mr. Yarsky feels it is time to record again. ''I didn't want to make another CD until I knew I can transcend what I already did,'' he said. ''I want people to stand up and say, 'Whoa!' because of beautiful songs, beautiful sounds and a recording technique that's completely revolutionary.</p>
        <p>''I saw 'Magnolia,' and I have never seen film used like that before,'' Mr. Yarsky said. ''I wanted to make a record like that. One as important as 'Sgt. Pepper's.' ''</p>
        <p>To fulfill that dream, Mr. Yarsky hopes to put together an ensemble that includes instruments recorded in a different manner than they are traditionally recorded. ''We will assign the electric guitar player to be drummer,'' Mr. Yarsky said. ''He will be miked like a drummer. It'll still sonically sound like guitar but its role will change. Drums would become melodic instruments rather than rhythmic ones.''</p>
        <p>He is also hoping to enlist well-known musicians like Diamanda Galas, Jane Siberry and Frank Christian, to join him on the project. ''I think it will be a big deal, but it could really be horrible,'' he said, with a powerful, contagious laugh. ''Hey, I even have financial backers. I'm thinking of myself as an I.P.O.''</p>
        <p>His style is best described as acoustic-pop, but that is misleading. His lyrics bring his music to another dramatic dimension, and his new material -- songs like ''Promised Land'' (about the death of a lover), ''I Love You and You and You'' (''skin makes me uncertain if love is what we feel'') and ''Fate,'' inspired by Anne Frank, (''Fate is my guardian angel, and she lives in a false floor'') -- sound as powerful as anything he's written.</p>
        <p>As he sings in ''Gush'': ''Healing is a messy business, feeling's not an obstacle, life starts and ends with a cry, you head toward light when you are born, you head toward light when you die.''</p>
