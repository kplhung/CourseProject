        <p>Roger Clemens pumped his last fastball of a gorgeous yet draining day, a high heater that roared by Rich Amaral for the final out in the seventh inning and caused most of the 54,350 fans at Yankee Stadium to rise and cheer. Clemens exhaled and trudged ever so slowly to the dugout, pulling his glove off, wiping the sweat off his forehead and ending a quality day of work.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have seen these dalliances with excellence before from Clemens, so they want to stay cautiously optimistic. They have seen Clemens look like the remarkably effective pitcher he was in a 3-1 victory over the Orioles yesterday. They have seen Clemens dominate for a few starts, only to have that consistency fade.</p>
        <p>So that is why they wait and wonder if Clemens is finally comfortable with throwing mostly four-seam fastballs and comfortable with being himself. This is merely two straight victories for the new and improved Clemens, who was really being the old and competent Clemens while notching his 250th career victory, but it is enough to have the Yankees hoping that maybe he can be superb all season.</p>
        <p>''Roger has always been a power pitcher and, once he gets hot, he stays hot,'' David Cone said. ''Once he gets his confidence, he can reel off 10 in a row. He's starting to look like that pitcher again.''</p>
        <p>If Cone is right, the Yankees, who have won six straight games, will be relieved and ecstatic. Clemens has often puzzled them since joining the team last year, sometimes pitching like a five-time Cy Young award winner and sometimes pitching like a 37-year-old who has lost confidence in his repertory. But Clemens has returned to his roots, relying on his fastball, and the results have been stunning.</p>
        <p>Clemens used an economical 99 pitches yesterday while allowing one run on four hits in seven innings, with five strikeouts and two walks. Those numbers almost mirror the one run and seven hits he allowed while beating the Blue Jays, 7-1, last Sunday. The revival is easy to explain: focus on the fastball.</p>
        <p>''He's throwing more fastballs and more fastballs for strikes,'' catcher Jorge Posada said. ''He's locating better and he's getting ahead of hitters. He's not making it harder on himself. He's making it easier on himself.''</p>
        <p>Posada could not explain why Clemens ever abandoned his best pitch in tight situations.</p>
        <p>But, when Manager Joe Torre was asked how important it was for Clemens to continue to depend on the fastball, he was so eager to answer the question that he almost did not wait until it was asked. Torre has long wanted Clemens to be the pitcher who throws 95 miles an hour to barge through sticky situations.</p>
        <p>''It's huge that you don't forget you have the thing, even though they know it's coming,'' Torre said. ''A lot of pitchers don't want to throw a particular pitch because the hitter is looking for it, but his fastball is different.</p>
        <p>''You can look for it, but he has so much movement and command of it that he doesn't give them many good pitches to hit.''</p>
        <p>Wearing a Tennessee Titans T-shirt and chugging a sports drink afterward, Clemens was reticent about the 250 victories and the back-to-back victories that have been fueled by his fastball.</p>
        <p>Clemens expects to win, so he does not offer much enthusiasm after he does. ''It's not ho-hum,'' Clemens said. ''I'll concentrate on my next start and get ready. I'm pleased that the work I've done has paid off. It makes it easier to get up tomorrow and start all over again.''</p>
        <p>Virtually every time Clemens encountered some danger against the Orioles, he used a fastball to rescue him. Four of his five strikeouts came on fastballs, and the other came on a split-finger fastball. He walked the leadoff batters in the first and second innings, but retired three in a row each time.</p>
        <p>Posada bashed a run-scoring double off the left-center-field fence in the second off Pat Rapp, and Shane Spencer had a sacrifice fly in the fourth to give Clemens a 2-0 lead. The Orioles cut it to 2-1 on back-to-back two-out doubles in the fifth before Clemens struck out Mike Bordick on a 1-2 fastball. Albert Belle roped a one-out double in the sixth, but Clemens used fastballs to retire Harold Baines and Cal Ripken Jr. on groundouts. Again, Torre smiled.</p>
        <p>''He knows what works for him,'' Torre said. ''I think it's just a matter of putting into practice his approach and knowing that it works.''</p>
        <p>Clemens said 300 victories ''seems a long way off'' since it would surely take him until at least the 2002 season, and he claimed that he had not remembered he had won his 250th until Mariano Rivera, who earned his 11th save, gave him the baseball. Cone doubted the veracity of Clemens's claim and lifted his eyebrows while talking about the milestone.</p>
        <p>''He should appreciate it,'' Cone said. ''It's a significant number. He's a sure-fire Hall of Famer. The next 50 are going to be tough. If anyone can do it, he can do it.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Second baseman CHUCK KNOBLAUCH (sprained left wrist) will take batting practice today, and he said he might play tomorrow.</p>
