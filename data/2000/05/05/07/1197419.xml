        <p>UNLESS you are a trained actor, chances are the thought of performing an improvisational skit in front of strangers is terrifying.</p>
        <p>Not so for 10-year-old Megan Faeth, who, as a member of the Somers Intermediate School's Destination ImagiNation team here, practically levitates with excitement at the possibility.</p>
        <p>''I like doing the instant challenge,'' Megan said. ''You have no idea what you're going to get, and you have to be quick thinking. Sometimes it's difficult, but it's also fun.''</p>
        <p>Such enthusiasm no doubt explains why Megan and teammates, Avery Faeth (her twin sister), Andrea Marshall, Michelle Wu, Emily King, and siblings, Bryony and Sam Lucas, took top honors at Destination ImagiNation's regional competition in Buffalo earlier this spring, earning for the first time in their school's history a DaVinci award for creativity, as well as a Renaissance award for technical achievement.</p>
        <p>The Destination ImagiNation competition, comparable to the Odyssey of the Mind program, rewards mental agility the way sports competitions celebrate the athletically talented. Don't think geography, spelling or math bee: the program (whose theme this year was ''Food  for Thought'') expects students to use a variety of techniques and solutions, embracing art, technology and drama, to solve open-ended problems.</p>
        <p>Parents and teachers attributed the success of the Somers team, in part, to the school's commitment to the program (Assistant Principal Cathy DeMartis hired a drama coach to teach the children improvisation skills) and to the children's experience working together.</p>
        <p>''They've grown and developed as a team,'' said one of the parent coaches, Lynn Lucas.</p>
        <p>Nor are these the only ones from the county headed for the world competition in Ames, Iowa, from May 24 to 28. The 700 participants will include 41 local students.</p>
        <p>They represent teams from Springhurst Elementary School in Dobbs Ferry, Brookside Elementary School in Yorktown (which also earned a Renaissance award) and two teams from the district's Mildred E. Strang Middle School (one of which earned a DaVinci award),  Pierre Van Cortlandt Middle School in Croton-on-Hudson and the team from Somers.</p>
        <p>Destination ImagiNation involves students in kindergarten through 12th grade. Each team prepares a long-term project and rehearses for the improvisational portion of the competition.</p>
        <p>''We have no idea what will hit them in competition,'' Mrs. Lucas said. ''It is difficult, but the kids love this. They thrive.'</p>
