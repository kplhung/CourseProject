        <p>The face is a road map of what the person has been through. I've always thought that if you present something straightforwardly and flat-footedly, the viewer has an active role in trying to figure out who this person is. At first I was interested in everybody seeing it only the way I saw it. But I think I've mellowed over the years. To control everything you lose something because you're just broadcasting. You're not receiving. I'm much more interested in finding out what other people think.</p>
