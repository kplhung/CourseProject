        <p>Nearly 12 years after Pan Am 103 plummeted from the night sky into the  small town of Lockerbie, Scotland, two Libyans accused of planting a bomb on the plane went on trial in a most unusual venue: a Dutch air base declared Scottish soil for the occasion. The deal was worked out so Libya's leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, could get United Nations sanctions lifted while still saving face. The prosecution plans to call more than 1,000 witnesses over a yearlong trial.</p>
