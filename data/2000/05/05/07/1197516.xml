        <p>A nationwide search has been launched by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to replace the Long Island Rail Road's president, Thomas Prendergast, whose resignation took effect on Friday. Kenneth Bauer, 52, of Long Beach, the L.I.R.R.'s vice president and chief financial officer, was named acting president.</p>
        <p>The selection of a successor to Mr. Prendergast, who resigned to accept a position as chief executive officer for the London Infrastructure Consortium, is expected in three to six months, according to Tom Kelly, the M.T.A. spokesman.

        <p>A nationwide search has been launched by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to replace the Long Island Rail Road's president, Thomas Prendergast, whose resignation took effect on Friday. Kenneth Bauer, 52, of Long Beach, the L.I.R.R.'s vice president and chief financial officer, was named acting president.</p>
        <p>The selection of a successor to Mr. Prendergast, who resigned to accept a position as chief executive officer for the London Infrastructure Consortium, is expected in three to six months, according to Tom Kelly, the M.T.A. spokesman. There was speculation that Mr. Bauer, who joined the M.T.A. in 1973 as an auditor, is interested in the position.</p>
        <p>''I look forward to meeting the challenges of running the busiest commuter rail system in North America,'' Mr. Bauer said in a prepared statement. ''As a lifelong resident of Long Island, I have a good understanding of the regional issues that affect us. And as a daily commuter on the railroad for more than 30 years, I am also quite familiar with our customers' concerns.''</p>
        <p>The chairman of the L.I.R.R. Commuters' Council, Lawrence H. Silverman, said he was ''disappointed'' that he was not told of Mr. Bauer's appointment in advance. He said he has written to E. Virgil Conway, the M.T.A. chairman, asking that he be allowed to participate in the process of selecting a new president.</p>
        <p>''I think it is reasonable for commuters to have a say in the selection process in view of the fact that the State Legislature created an M.T.A. board position for the council,'' he said. ''There is no one more suitable than a representative of the commuters to interview candidates to determine their degree of understanding consumer service issues.''</p>
