        <p>'Na Vota, in Piedmont dialect, means ''olden times.'' At Cantine Sant'Agata this label relives yesterdays when locals turned backyard grapes like the obscure, rustic ruche into homemade wine. In the late 1980's, the authorities endowed a few villages with an appellation, Ruche di Castagnole Monferrato, and the personal grape went commercial.</p>
        <p>Only 10,000 cases of ruche are made yearly, said the importer, John Given of Staatsburg, N.Y. And only a handful of shops carry the Sant'Agata. Customers, once hooked, are ''repeats,'' proprietors say.</p>
        <p>Small wonder. Too much of this big, fleshy, tannic '98 red is not enough. Fifteen minutes after the uncorking, its aromas and flavors flower, evoking memories of lingered-over garden dinners in northwestern Italy.</p>
        <p>The best way to appreciate the ruche -- at home only -- is to use professionals' technique for gauging wine: take a small sip and, without swallowing, open your lips, suck air in and aerate the wine 15 seconds.</p>
        <p>Fruity, spicy, seemingly sweet flavors dense with subtleties that catch you unaware -- like internal rhyme in a poem -- spread to every part of the palate, opening and opening as they go. Licorice, raspberry and grilled nuts pop up.  In the end, the ruche's staying power fosters contentment.</p>
        <p>The wine costs $18 at the Wine Connection, 71 Westchester Avenue, Pound Ridge; $20 at Hilltop Wines, 423 King Street, Chappaqua; and $18 at Town Center Liquors, a Buy-Rite store, at 1620 Route 22 (at Route 312), Brewster.</p>
