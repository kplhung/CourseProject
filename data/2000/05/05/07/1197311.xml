        <p>GLAMOROUS as they may be by reputation, game safaris in East Africa, whether tented or otherwise, have never been truly luxurious, nor did most people expect them to be.</p>
        <p>It was felt, rather, that the experience should be at least just a little on the rough side, even if you were staying in game lodges and viewing the animals from a Land Rover or a minivan; that in short the authentic safari experience demanded, and was even improved by, a certain degree of character-building discomfort.</p>
        <p>In theory there is something to be said for keeping things a bit rugged when it comes to East African tourism: There's a romantic appeal to the notion of roughing it on safari, even though people nowadays are likely to be roughing it in permanent camps that have tents with roofs, indoor plumbing and electric lights (until the generator shuts off), or in a safari lodge, even the least luxurious of which have a bar, a gift shop and a swimming pool.</p>
        <p>But there's a larger philosophical question here. Over the past decade or more, East Africa has been moving steadily toward mass tourism. Some of the game parks -- Amboseli National Park, in Kenya, is a perfect example -- were virtually destroyed by the sheer number of tourists, and on the rare occasion when you saw a lion, the poor animal was instantly surrounded by dozens of minibuses. One felt -- felt strongly -- that there was something degrading about the experience, that too many people were chasing too few animals, and in the process undermining the fragile ecology and turning the park into a dust bowl.</p>
        <p>Now, the pendulum seems to have begun swinging in the opposite direction (though perhaps too late for Amboseli, alas). In both Kenya and Tanzania, new ideas are taking hold -- of smaller, more luxurious lodges, of placing less reliance on the old idea of constantly moving the tourist around in a vehicle, of a tourism of quality, as opposed to quantity.</p>
        <p>Our first hint of this change came when we were planning our December safari for four -- my wife, Margaret, and I with friends and neighbors of ours in Dutchess County, Jeff and Sue Lynn. We arranged the trip through Abercrombie &amp; Kent. We wanted very much to go back to Tanzania, especially the Ngorongoro Crater and the Serengeti during the great migration, which we had done several times before.</p>
        <p>On our first trip, 15 years ago, conditions had been primitive, and the food supply seemed to consist mostly of carrots and eggs. Gradually, over the years, things got better, but Tanzania was still dramatically less comfortable than Kenya, with a bureaucracy that made getting in and out of the country something of a challenge. But today, we were assured, things had changed. A South African hotel consortium had built a new lodge a couple of years ago on the rim of the Ngorongoro Crater that was, to put it bluntly, ''over the top.''</p>
        <p>''Yeah, yeah,'' we grumbled, but in the face of a barrage of enthusiasm from Abercrombie &amp; Kent, booked into Ngorongoro Crater Lodge.</p>
        <p>Our first surprise, flying in a charter plane from Kenya into Tanzania, was that everyone at Kilimanjaro International Airport was pleasant, helpful and friendly. On previous visits, it had been like flying into East Germany in the old days, particularly coming from Kenya, toward which there was great suspicion and hostility, but the airport is now pretty cheerful, with well-stocked souvenir shops and smiling bureaucrats. Our luggage went through customs without a search and was loaded onto our chartered Tanzanian Beechcraft. An hour later we landed on the rim of the crater; the airstrip here is often foggy, so many guests of the Ngorongoro Crater Lodge land at Lake Manyara, two and a half hours away at ''game drive speed.'' (During our own 20-minute drive to the lodge, we saw one big old tusker in a field by himself, right next to the road).</p>
        <p>The lodge was set so close to the rim of the crater that it looked as if it might slide 2,000 feet or so into it; it's as if somebody had built a hotel on the rim of the Grand Canyon. At first sight it has a certain Moorish feel, since it is bordered by a crenelated high pink stucco wall that reminds one rather of those at Fez or Marrakech, but there is an air of fantasy to it, a slightly dotty passion for odd shapes and forms that is more Hollywood than Morocco. Cecil B. De Mille  would have loved this place!</p>
        <p>A very nice young man meets us and takes us into the lodge's main building -- or one of the main buildings, for, as he explains it, the lodge is built on three different levels, and divided into three separate camps, two with 12 suites each and one with six; each camp has its own central house for dinner, drinks and lounging. Vast windows overlook a sheer drop to the crater floor and a panorama that stretches forever.</p>
        <p>Scarcely less breathtaking is the decor, to which the phrase ''over the top'' scarcely does justice. In fact, not since I was in Cher's house in Malibu have I been anywhere so extraordinary.</p>
        <p>Here, competing for attention, are giant fireplaces, African sculpture and weapons, fine bronzes, English country furniture, extravagant and very beautiful tile work in the Moorish tradition, paneled walls in the sumptuous and elegant living room, where everybody gathers for drinks and hors d'oeuvres before dinner, a dining room full of light, air, unexpected corners and fireplaces and tables set with an elegance that would be sumptuous in Paris or New York. The men's room is so unexpected and luxuriously decorated that we all go to visit it -- it's as if Versace had been asked to design a urinal -- only to discover that the ladies' room is even more baroque.</p>
        <p>A short walk down to our own bungalow -- avoiding the traces of Cape buffalo that have found their way around the wall at night -- brings us to a round hut, in the African tradition, with another splendid view. Outside, beautifully hand-carved wooden doors, the whole thing like a Hollywood set for the chief's hut in a movie; inside, weird ''Phantom of the Opera'' excess: a king-sized bed with a vast carved headboard, so you can lie in bed and look out over the crater; magnificent antique furniture, all veneer and ormolu; high ceilings; vast, velvet drapes; a huge crystal chandelier, and strange, tiny windows on the non-crater sides, with elaborate carved shutters. There is a silver tray with an antique crystal decanter of sherry and antique crystal goblets -- drinks are on the house, we have been told, except for Champagne and Cognac. Furniture is upholstered either in soft leather or dark velvet, with pillows everywhere. The interior design of the hut looks like -- well, frankly, Malibu, but out the window one can see Africa stretching before one's eyes.</p>
        <p>More surprises. A big old-fashioned bathtub in the middle of the bedroom floor (and even more surprising, scads of hot water, day and night, and thick, luxurious towels), so you can soak and look out over the crater and the far horizon, a shower big enough for half a dozen people, with a tiled seat like that in a Turkish bath, a big fireplace (which is kept burning by unseen hands), magnificent parquet floors, one-size-fits-all Wellies in case of mud or rain. Everything, in short, has been thought of.</p>
        <p>We have our own valet, who is responsible for our well-being -- looks after the bungalow, brings snacks and drinks, waits on us at meals and summons security guards at night when we want to go to and from the main house, just in case there are buffalo or worse around. And all this is before we've had a meal.</p>
        <p>But it's the meal that astonishes. The chef (from Claridge's in London, if you please) wrings a miracle out of thin air three times a day (three and a half, if you include teatime): wonderful cheeses, glorious duck, great soups, arrays of exotic fruit and lighter-than-air pastry. Every meal is a surprise and delight, perfectly presented and served, accompanied by excellent South African wines. Anything we want, he will prepare for us, he assures us; we shouldn't feel confined to the menu.</p>
        <p>It is like being at sea, first class on the old Queen Elizabeth or the Queen Mary, and by the end of lunch it is all we can do to waddle up to the gift shop (very expensive, world-class shopping), back to our beds for a nap, then, after tea, down into the crater itself to see some game.</p>
        <p>The crater and its game are something special and wonderful, and worth coming halfway round the world to see. Just in case we get hungry en route, the hotel's game driver takes with him a thermos of coffee, iced soft drinks, the kitchen's latest batch of freshly baked biscuits and cookies -- he is as concerned about our comfort as he is to get us close to a lion or a leopard.</p>
        <p>Dinner is served at 8, and we leave ourselves an hour to join our fellow guests and the management for drinks before the fire in the big living room. There is a wonderful array of sherries and madeiras in cut-glass decanters accompanied by freshly baked hot cheese straws. In the dining room, the fireplaces have been lighted, the lighting is subdued and the African sculpture in alcoves illuminated from above so they stand out with startling effect.</p>
        <p>No effort is made to push guests into matey conversation -- some are standoffish, some not, to begin with -- but the atmosphere and the charm of the management team soon break down any initial reserve or language barriers, and by dinnertime people are exchanging business cards, scribbled addresses (''If you're ever in Cape Town . . .''), photographs of game and, of course, safari stories.</p>
        <p>There are several South Africans visiting the lodge from the company that owns it, the mysteriously named Conservation Corporation Africa, which runs equally luxurious and unusual lodges and camps in South Africa, Zimbabwe and East Africa.</p>
        <p>However unique the Ngorongoro Crater Lodge is, it is also the cutting edge of a trend. Before this sybaritic stay in Tanzania, we had visited Kenya, and found one of East Africa's classic camps also in the course of change, and maintaining its ecological integrity in the process. Wilderness Trails at Lewa Downs near Isiolo, belonging to the energetic and charming Craig family, is in the process of being upgraded to luxury status. Its original six rooms are in three cottages, with each cottage sharing a sitting room and verandah. Two newer cottages have only one bedroom apiece, and more privacy; a separate house an hour's drive away is also available for rent.</p>
        <p>While the Craigs do not go in for elaborate decor or crystal chandeliers, they now have perhaps the most beautiful swimming pool in the world, one edge of which simply vanishes into space, above a deep canyon through which lion and leopard occasionally prowl. And the wonderful food, served outdoors in great style, will leave you looking for a Stairmaster.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, since the Craigs own 45,000 acres of the surrounding countryside, you can go on guided and guarded walks to work off some of the food, or on morning horseback safaris, ending in a delicious breakfast cooked out in the bush, so you can eat your eggs and bacon watching zebra and even rhino watching you, then walk back.</p>
        <p>Accommodations are in thatched cottages, with lovely sitting rooms with open fireplaces and your own self-service bar. The Craigs are a big family, with the elder Craigs still very much involved in the daily doings, and their two sons and their families running things now. They are ideal hosts -- friendly without getting in your way -- and endlessly interesting, with very nice children and dogs, so it's like staying in an English country house, right down to the hearty teas and the coffee and brandy in front of the fireplace at night.</p>
        <p>The wildlife is hard to beat, particularly when it comes to rhinoceros, which are increasingly rare and hard to see elsewhere, but which at Lewa Downs are given sanctuary and wander close to the house in all ages and sizes. The vegetable garden is well worth seeing, and the house is set in beautiful English gardens, filled with magnificent furniture from African woods made in their own workshops.</p>
        <p>Here, too, in less flamboyant style, are smaller, more deluxe accommodations, and an effort to put the visitor in a place where the game goes by, rather than going in pursuit of it. If the ecology, and the game itself, is to survive in the wild, smaller and on foot is better, with or without the luxury component. The alternative, perhaps -- God forbid! -- will be game theme parks.</p>
        <p>In this sense, the Craigs may have set a precedent. From the beginning, after Kenyan independence in 1963, when they opened their house to visitors, they have had game walks, game rides on horseback, bird walks and bird watching outposts for marsh birds. The only game drives are in open four-wheel-drive vehicles.</p>
        <p>The experience of seeing the animals, unforgettable however many times you do it, is only improved by getting at once closer to them and to nature, and is not diminished by luxury at the end of the day. Nor would it be diminished by a simple tent on the veldt. The point is not luxury, but reducing the number of visitors and vehicles. To see, as we did, a leopard close up in broad daylight -- to watch it for nearly an hour -- is more deeply satisfying than all the museums in the world.</p>
