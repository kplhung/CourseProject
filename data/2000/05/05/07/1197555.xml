        <p>I KNOW I'm supposed to curb my dog, but occasionally she goes when I'm not paying attention, and it seems cruel to yank her away. Well, I'm not going to feel sorry for her anymore. And you shouldn't feel sorry for your dog. Because that urine kills trees and other plants.</p>
        <p>''The acid eats right through the bark and cambial zone to the wood zone, destroying the tree's defense system,'' said Eric T. Fleisher, the director of horticulture at the Battery Park City Parks Conservancy, which oversees the public park at the lower tip of Manhattan. Even a small opening in the bark is a gateway for micro-organisms that can spread disease through the tree.</p>
        <p>One gorgeous morning last week, Mr. Fleisher, who is known as T, bent over the devastated base of a 15-foot linden tree on a corner of Rector Place, where it ends at the walkway along the Hudson River. The bark was completely eaten away, exposing the living tissue, through which nutrients and water flow. A knobby ridge of calluses showed where the tree had tried to wall off the damage, to no avail.</p>
        <p>''When you do a proper pruning cut, the tree can compartmentalize that damage,'' Mr. Fleisher said. ''But it can't localize something like this.''</p>
        <p>The base of the tree was stained dark gray, and its bark was deeply fissured, from dog-leg-level to the ground. The soil was as hard as concrete, from all those dog feet, so the roots were suffocating. (Urine also contains a lot of salt, which deprives the plants of water and burns their roots.)</p>
        <p>''The only way to correct this is for people to alter the way they train their animal,'' Mr. Fleisher said. ''Even an older dog can be trained. Years ago, when my family moved to the Upper East Side, we taught our old dog Franny to go in the street.'' This is especially important for a dog that has been kept inside for hours. ''He'll still try to mark the plants, but he won't be emptying his bladder on one tree,'' Mr. Fleisher said. Picture dozens of dogs doing that to the same tree.</p>
        <p>Such frank talk might disturb readers expecting to learn about tree peonies and such, but this is consciousness-raising time. Take a look at street trees and shrubs along well-used park paths. The damage is unmistakable. And even if you don't have a dog, you might say something to the next offender -- politely, of course. Many people don't realize that their adorable pets kill trees.</p>
        <p>''Of the 24 trees we replaced this year, 6 were due to urine,'' Mr. Fleisher said. And trees at park entrances, like this linden, are usually the first to go.</p>
        <p>Battery Park gardeners never wrap a newly planted tree with burlap, because it holds urine next to the bark. To try to counteract ground compaction, they add gypsum to lighten the soil and neutralize the salt, and lime to offset the acidity. Aerating is also important, to open up compacted soil and let plant roots breathe. And mulching with organic matter also helps.</p>
        <p>''We do very little fertilizing,'' Mr. Fleisher said. ''We just keep incorporating leaf mold and compost. A small percentage of aged horse or cow manure is helpful, in terms of grubs and other insects, protozoa and nematodes, which all make up a healthy, living soil.'' Such additions also help roots absorb magnesium and other elements in the soil.</p>
        <p>''I view fertilizer as junk food,'' Mr. Fleisher said. ''If the pH is right, and you have good organisms in your soil, the plants will get what they need.'' As we walked along the allee of lindens, he pointed out mugho pines, azaleas and yew all under stress from dogs. The leaves were limp and flaccid, and the soil was compacted. The yew's needles were yellowed; the muhgo pines had scale. When a plant is stressed, it's more likely to be attacked by insects.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fleisher also emphasized the importance of planting a tree at the right depth to give it a healthy start and a leg up, so to speak, on dogs. ''They used to say plant at the same depth as it was planted in the nursery, but there's often too much soil on top of the root ball,'' he said. If you plant too deep, the roots aren't able to get enough oxygen, so they grow upward, seeking air.</p>
        <p>''They tend to grow back towards the trunk and girdle the tree,'' he said.</p>
        <p>If you look carefully at a tree, you will see how the trunk flares out near the bottom. The bottom of this flare should be flush with the ground, Mr. Fleisher said. ''The periderm is much tougher in this area, so it won't deteriorate as fast from dog urine,'' he said. Bark higher up is less resistant.</p>
        <p>But such measures just delay a tree's demise if it is constantly watered by dogs. So keep them in the street to do that.</p>
        <p>If this sounds ''unnatural,'' cities are unnatural places. Remember how awful the streets were before owners were required to clean up after their pets?</p>
        <p>Mr. Fleisher's garden crew is also experimenting with a minty spray that is supposed to repel dogs from plants. In their own version of a controlled experiment, they are spraying some trees with the mint mixture and others just with water. The sprayers aren't supposed to know which is which, but the minty smell is unmistakable. And it's quite attractive. If I were a dog I'd go toward those trees. Mr. Fleisher's crew isn't waiting with bated breath, but they'll try anything once.</p>
        <p>You get the picture. You can love Fido and a linden, too.</p>
