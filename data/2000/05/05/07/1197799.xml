        <p>OF TWO MINDS</p>
        <p>The Growing Disorder</p>
        <p>in American Psychiatry.</p>
        <p>By T. M. Luhrmann.</p>
        <p>337 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Alfred A. Knopf. $26.95.</p>
        <p>There is a popular aphorism among research scientists to the effect that if, in the course of performing an experiment, you pose the question in the wrong way, you are doomed to arrive at the wrong answer. That bit of scientific folklore occurred to me repeatedly as I made my way through ''Of Two Minds: The Growing Disorder in American Psychiatry,'' T. M. Luhrmann's fascinating anthropological study of the way young doctors learn to be psychiatrists. What becomes clear, as one reads deeper into her book, is that we are in the midst of an enormous social and medical experiment about the way we deal with mental illness in this country. Not only have we posed the question incorrectly, according to Luhrmann, but we are doomed to reach a tragically wrong, and profoundly immoral, answer by doing so.</p>
        <p>The question that lies at the heart of ''Of Two Minds'' is one that, in simplified form, has riven psychiatry for at least 20 years. Are mental illnesses like schizophrenia, depression and personality disorders a matter of biological dysfunction and thus best treated pharmacologically, or are they the product of psychosocial factors -- family dynamics, early childhood experiences, the whole closet of Freudian baggage -- and thus best treated by psychotherapy? What makes the question flawed, of course, is the way it is posed, as an either-or proposition. Luhrmann's book bears witness -- unwittingly at first, then with increasingly cleareyed intellectual analysis -- to the fact that a third party, namely managed care, has seized upon that flawed question and answered it ''irrevocably'' in favor of biological psychiatry, with ramifications that will very likely be felt in this country for decades to come.</p>
        <p>Aspiring psychiatrists straddle two seemingly contradictory worlds: the hard, quantitative world of medical science and the more ambiguous, intuitional world of human interaction. Trained as doctors, they attend four years of medical school and serve internships for a year in settings that resemble ''E.R.,'' not Freud's study in Vienna. Then they typically spend at least three years as residents specializing in psychiatric medicine, treating both the severely ill (in the hospital setting) and the less incapacitated (in outpatient clinics). It is during the formative years of residency that the two rival models of psychiatric medicine compete for the hearts and minds of tomorrow's practitioners, and it is the voices of this population -- earnest, confused, overwhelmed and more and more cynical -- that fill ''Of Two Minds.'' As Luhrmann writes, young psychiatrists are in principle supposed to learn to be equally good at talk therapy and drug therapy, equally conversant in the theories underlining psychotherapy and biomedical psychiatry. But in practice, the two approaches are often seen as antagonistic. ''By the end of your second year,'' a resident says, ''you have to decide which camp you're in.''</p>
        <p>In the course of nearly a decade of research, Luhrmann, a professor of anthropology at the University of California, San Diego, inhabited the various nests of these psychiatric fledglings. Her shrewd, witty observations ring true: when she innocently begins inquiring about a claim she's heard that residents at a university in Kentucky diagnose mental disorders in 30 seconds, administrators at the hospital she's visiting hasten to assure her that diagnoses are based on a thorough and painstaking patient interview, while the residents on the front lines respond by wondering what takes their colleagues in Kentucky so long.</p>
        <p>By good fortune, Luhrmann happened to choose a particularly pivotal moment in the history of psychiatry. Most readers will be familiar with the tectonic ideological stresses that have caused such visible upheaval in the field today: the repudiation of many Freudian tenets, the rise and undeniable success of new medications to treat the most intractable forms of mental illness and the more impersonal, hurried approach that often comes with the dispensing of drugs. But these ideological differences reverberate day by day for trainees. ''Working with these different models,'' Luhrmann writes, ''changes the way the staff joke, the way doctors relate to nurses and even the sense of the unit's ultimate goal. Ultimately, these differences help to produce different moral sensibilities about mental illness.''</p>
        <p>PART of this dynamic, of course, involves psychoanalysis' fall from grace. Almost willfully nonquantitative, as Luhrmann notes, the field never bothered to prove its worth with outcome studies, never conceded that talk therapy might be wholly ineffective against the most severe disease and never owned up to the scandal of implicating family dynamics in models of illness that now seem firmly rooted in brain dysfunction. The handwriting on the wall, in terms of the beginning of the end of psychoanalysis' golden age, coincided with the handwriting on the prescription pad. In 1954, Smith Kline &amp; French began to market the antipsychotic drug Thorazine as a treatment for severe illnesses, and as neuroscience became increasingly sophisticated and increasingly molecular in the decades that followed, ''illness'' as the term of choice for mental disorder subtly gave way to ''disease.'' In one fascinating aside, Luhrmann reports that psychiatrists who trained during the 1960's began to distrust the psychoanalytic model in part because of their own use of recreational drugs like LSD. ''If a drug can do this to my sense of reality, what am I doing taking all this psychoanalytic stuff at face value?'' one psychiatrist recalls thinking.</p>
        <p>Luhrmann is not the first observer to lament the loss of the psychodynamic component in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. The power of her book, however, derives from the intuition that initially brought her to the project: by focusing on trainees, she positions herself to understand sooner than the rest of us that the brief, swift and brutal impact of managed care is destined to diminish the practice of psychiatric medicine for years to come. ''Patients are less well off without psychotherapy,'' she writes near the end of her book. ''They do less well, are readmitted more quickly, diagnosed more inaccurately and medicated more randomly.'' She approvingly quotes one senior psychiatrist as saying, ''You cannot adhere to untruths without being immoral in some way.''</p>
        <p>Many readers may find Luhrmann's sympathetic discussion of psychotherapy a little too forgiving. I found it refreshing. All the same, I would have liked a less understated treatment of the enormous excitement about contemporary neuroscience, and perhaps more than a nod in the direction of some of psychotherapy's successes, like cognitive behavioral therapy.</p>
        <p>There are two casualties of psychiatry's split personality. The first, and most obvious, is the patient. Toward the end of her fieldwork, Luhrmann revisits a hospital where she spent considerable time in 1992; she describes the experience as ''a little like coming back to a tree-lined London neighborhood after the blitz.'' A third of the staff had been fired; gardeners and cooks had been dismissed; salaries were about to be slashed; and many senior psychiatrists had left, in sorrow and disgust. ''I left myself,'' one psychiatrist said, ''when a patient came onto my unit and tried to hang herself twice by the end of the first day, and then Utilization Review [a hospital office that negotiates with the insurer] said she'd only been authorized for a two-day admission and would have to be discharged. I kept thinking about what the jury would say if she killed herself and I was the one held liable.'' The reader comes away with the overwhelming sense that an institutional, economic and almost philosophical form of medical malpractice has been unleashed upon psychiatric medicine, and it has condemned -- in the name of controlling costs -- thousands of patients to permanent illness.</p>
        <p>The other casualty is less obvious. One can foresee, in the not-too-distant future, what might be called a grand unification theory of psychiatry, a convergence of the psychosocial and the molecular, of talk therapy and drug therapy, where the psychological residue of hectoring mothers and absent fathers might plausibly find microscopic correlation in the residue of proteins in synapses, and where the psychoneurological patterns associated with those residues might plausibly be rearranged not only by drugs but by conversation. It is the demoralizing implication of ''Of Two Minds'' that we now might never have a chance of reaching that future at all.</p>
