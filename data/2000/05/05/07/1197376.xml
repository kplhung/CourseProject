        <p>Q: Many neuroscientists think of the brain as a great calculating machine. By contrast, you study emotion and feeling. What led you in that direction?</p>
        <p>I got interested in the emotions after studying patients who had lost the ability to emote and feel under certain circumstances. Many of those patients also had major impairments in their ability to make decisions. The possible link between emotion and decision making was so striking that it forced me to look into the emotions. Here's an example: Some patients lose a part of the brain called the amygdala. As a result, they cannot recognize fear in people's expressions, and they cannot experience fear themselves.</p>

        <p>Q: Many neuroscientists think of the brain as a great calculating machine. By contrast, you study emotion and feeling. What led you in that direction?</p>
        <p>I got interested in the emotions after studying patients who had lost the ability to emote and feel under certain circumstances. Many of those patients also had major impairments in their ability to make decisions. The possible link between emotion and decision making was so striking that it forced me to look into the emotions. Here's an example: Some patients lose a part of the brain called the amygdala. As a result, they cannot recognize fear in people's expressions, and they cannot experience fear themselves.</p>
        <p>What is the distinction, as you define it, between emotion and feeling?</p>
        <p>When we talk about emotion, we really talk about a collection of behaviors that are produced by the brain. You can look at a person in the throes of an emotion and observe changes in the face, in the body posture, in the coloration of the skin and so on.</p>
        <p>Feeling, however, is a private process, an inner process. It involves your perception of all the changes that are taking place in your body during an emotion.</p>
        <p>Can you give me a specific example? Say, sadness?</p>
        <p>When you experience the emotion of sadness, there will be changes in facial expression, and your body will be closed in, withdrawn. There are also changes in your heart, your guts: they slow down. And there are hormonal changes. The feeling of sadness involves your perception of these changes in your body. You may have the sense that your body has slowed down, has less energy, feels ill. Your thought processes also change. The production of new images slows down, your attention may be concentrated on a few images. By contrast, when you experience joy and elation, you become able to create images more rapidly, and your attention can be proportionally shorter. You feel quick, not stuck.</p>
        <p>Emotions and feelings can be slippery. Is there, nonetheless, a basic human repertory?</p>
        <p>Absolutely. When you do studies across cultures you find an enormous stability. You find certain repertories of behaviors that obviously have been placed in our biology during the history of evolution because they match certain challenges in the environment.</p>
        <p>When we want judges or generals or politicians to make good decisions, we often ask them to think dispassionately. But you have said that our ability to reason is as likely to be harmed by a lack of emotion as by an excess of emotion. How is this so?</p>
        <p>Rather than being a luxury, emotions are a very intelligent way of driving an organism toward certain outcomes. Let's say you are trying to make a complicated decision. If you try to do a cost-benefit analysis, it may take you forever to decide whether to do A or B. However, if you have previously been in similar situations, and if you have been either rewarded or punished by the choices you made in those situations, then emotional memory may help you with your current choice. That help may come in the form of a gut feeling or, more subtly, in the form of a nonconscious bias that leads you in a certain direction. And we know this because if you're deprived of those emotions then, lo and behold, rather than being sort of a coolheaded reasoner, you become a rather poor reasoner.</p>
        <p>But using emotional memory to guide decisions doesn't always work.</p>
        <p>Exactly. If you have not had the right experiences, or if you have not classified your experiences in a good way, your emotional memory could be leading you in the wrong direction. So I am not saying that you should start listening to your emotions and do what your emotions tell you. This is not a ''touchy feely'' prescription.</p>
        <p>So if the lesson for laypeople is not to ''get in touch'' with their emotions, what is it?</p>
        <p>Don't denigrate the fact that emotions can play a role in how you normally operate. One can fall into the trap of being hyperrationalistic -- emotional memory can have a very good tempering effect. And don't interpret reason as separate from emotion, but as part of a continuum. Both reason and emotion are part of our life mechanisms.</p>
        <p>Has this fact made you more likely to trust your gut when reading complex data?</p>
        <p>Oh, no, to the contrary.</p>
