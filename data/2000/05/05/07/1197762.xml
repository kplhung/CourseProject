        <p>The rally was organized by several groups, including Cures Not Wars, the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, the Black Coalition on Drugs, the Cannabis Action Network and Legalize!</p>
        <p>One large group began forming in Washington Square Park before joining the marchers. As the group formed, police patrolling in the area warned the crowd over bullhorns that anyone using illegal substances would be arrested.</p>
