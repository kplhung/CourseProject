        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Years ago, when I was writing freelance interviews for The New York Times, I was severely depressed when I read a very funny interview with Elaine May in the Arts &amp; Leisure section. ''I can never top that one,'' I thought. The next week it was revealed that Elaine May had written her own interview under a pseudonym. Maybe that's the way to go. I was reminded of that when I read Ms. May's piercing interrogation of Alan Arkin on why there are no bagels on the set of her play ''Taller Than a Dwarf'' [''Creation, Without Bagels,'' April 2]. Why, indeed? It also reminded me of Federico Fellini's way with an interviewer (myself) in 1975. ''Ask me easy questions,'' he said. ''Ask me about ice cream.'' Actually, I would have asked him about the shortage of bagels in Rome, but the phone rang and he talked about ''Casanova'' instead.</p>
