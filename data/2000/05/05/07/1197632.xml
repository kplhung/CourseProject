        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>In ''The Laptop Ate My Attention Span'' (Preludes, April 16), Abby Ellin laments how M.B.A. students are using their laptop computers during class to surf the Internet and send e-mail to their friends.</p>
        <p>At the school where I teach and supervise the technology program, all students in grades 5 to 12 own laptops and bring them to classes. Our teachers have had similar difficulties in keeping students' attention.</p>
        <p>Our approach to the problem, however, is somewhat different. We believe that as new technologies bring increased functionality to our students it is incumbent on us as professionals to adapt to it and use it to add meaning to learning.</p>
        <p>The column seems to regard Web surfing in the classroom as a breach of etiquette, regardless of how boring a professor's lecture may be.</p>
        <p>Without doubt, students can be impolite, even rude, and the Internet age should not remove the burden of polite conduct. But given the expense of graduate degrees, shouldn't there be some significant adjustment by professors in the way they teach? Students, after all, are customers who have paid handsomely to be in these classes. Their behavior should not be a disturbance or distraction to others, but their rapt attention is a tribute, not an obligation.</p>
        <p>At our school, we are constantly reminding ourselves of the mutual acts of civility that must accompany laptops in the classroom.</p>
        <p>JOE HOFMEISTER  Cincinnati, April 16</p>
        <p>The writer is the technology director at the Cincinnati Country Day School.</p>
