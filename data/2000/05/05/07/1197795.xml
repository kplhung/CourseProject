        <p>The Feast of Love</p>
        <p>By Charles Baxter.</p>
        <p>308 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Pantheon Books. $24.</p>
        <p>NIGHT breeds its own sort of anticipation, and the opening scene in Charles Baxter's extraordinary new novel, ''The Feast of Love,'' perfectly captures its disorientations. The moon is singing; the rain is falling through the maple leaves, despite the starry sky. No, wait, that's the sound of caterpillars munching; the ground is squishy with their dead bodies.</p>
        <p>A sleepless character named Charles Baxter -- a writer who, like his creator, lives in Ann Arbor, Mich. -- wanders into a park in these stolen hours after midnight. Here on a bench under a street light he encounters a fellow who ''looks like an exceptionally handsome toad,'' accompanied by a dog. This neighbor, the overly friendly Bradley (whose dog is also named Bradley), suggests that Baxter write about him and call the book ''The Feast of Love.'' Despite Baxter's resistance, Bradley forges ahead with a description of what happened between him and his first wife.</p>
        <p>Normally, I'd be put off by this sort of self-consciousness, but here it ratchets up a sense of the odd shadowy night world in much the same way that a dream pun resonates far deeper than your average play on words. What's more, every magical promise implicit in this night is kept: ''The Feast of Love'' is as precise, as empathetic, as luminous as any of Baxter's past work. It is also rich, juicy, laugh-out-loud funny and completely engrossing.</p>
        <p>Baxter has always been good at delineating characters who are essentially standing still. What movement there was in his first two novels was highly unconventional. ''First Light'' moved back in time, watching a car-salesman brother and an astrophysicist sister go through adulthood, childhood and finally babyhood. By the end, you felt you knew these two characters through and through; you'd probably recognize them on the street. In ''Shadow Play,'' Baxter's second novel, the main direction seemed to be down into the depths, best epitomized by two different but powerfully drawn scenes in which people witnessed drownings. The characters left on the surface then tried their own more metaphorical dives, basically into themselves, searching for truth or justice.</p>
        <p>In ''The Feast of Love,'' Baxter's X-ray vision remains intact, but a lot more happens between and to his characters. You see how they get from point A to point B. You see clear repercussions. You see wheels spinning within wheels. In short, there's a lot more conventional plot.</p>
        <p>After hearing Bradley's tale, Baxter the character calls up the ex, who is named Kathryn, and we get her side of the story: Bradley hummed while he made love, as if he were changing a light bulb. He was pleased when she compared him to Lon Chaney. ''He was one of those men who could talk articulately about anything -- food or movies or music or current events -- but you could discern in the middle of his conversation that he had commenced to brood about something else that was not making its way into the mix. Right at the table he'd disappear on you and you couldn't get him back.''</p>
        <p>Dominating Kathryn's account is a lesbian affair she found herself caught up in when she was first married to Bradley, an affair that seems to have barely registered in his consciousness. A common problem with a ''Rashomon''-style narrative is the repetition it entails. (Did they even bother to change camera angles in the movie version of ''The End of the Affair''?) Yet Baxter manages never to go over precisely the same ground. Although some points match, more or less, others flat out contradict each other -- all in a very believable, amusing, illuminating way.</p>
        <p>Essential to the explosion of story in this novel is the fluidity with which Baxter switches the point of view back and forth among Bradley, Kathryn and a host of other characters: an elderly philosophy professor still agonizing over his estrangement from a mentally deranged son, a ferociously sexual female lawyer, her volatile pharmaceutical-executive lover and a much-pierced adolescent girl named Chloe. The list sounds diffuse and in lesser hands it probably would be, but Baxter, through his clever use of overlapping incidents and serendipitous connections, unifies the narrative without ever forcing its pieces to fit.</p>
        <p>The philosophy professor is Bradley's neighbor. The lawyer is Bradley's second ex-wife. Chloe works at Jitters, Bradley's coffee bar. None of them are particularly involved in Bradley's present life. In fact, they are all fiercely involved in other relationships -- even the lawyer, Diana, during her brief marriage to Bradley. (''Diana's agoraphobia presented a bit of a problem as regards the honeymoon'' is the delightful beginning of one of Bradley's sections.)</p>
        <p>The moonlight-bathed nighttime opening and a quotation toward the end of the book suggest a parallel between ''The Feast of Love'' and ''A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' Certainly Baxter the writer captures a similarly shape-changing enchantment. And although the rest of the book doesn't take place during that one night, you can see how it was inspired by it. But you can make too much of this analogy. (The book jacket surely does.) Love, both romantic and sexual, is not the be-all and end-all here. Neither death nor attempted rape makes its creepy way into Shakespeare's lighthearted comedy, but both are found in ''The Feast of Love,'' which has an explicitly dark side that you don't really suspect at the beginning of the book, despite the night terrors Baxter himself shares in the very first scene.</p>
        <p>But the greater struggle belongs to Chloe. If Bradley is the heart of the book, then she is its soul. Her energetic voice is slangy and defiant, yet at the same time remarkably sweet. At first, the story of her love for Oscar, a former drug addict with the ''re-entry calmed-down zombie look'' of a boy in recovery, seems to be merely an ironic counterpoint to the messed-up lives of the older characters. Despite tongue studs, weird hair and jeans with ripped-out knees, Chloe and Oscar still nurse certain traditional notions. (He imagines coming home to a house with a foyer; she pictures three kids in Oshkosh overalls.) These two can't seem to succeed at anything but loving each other, although they do that very well indeed. By the end, they have carried most of the book's emotional and dramatic burden.</p>
        <p>What's amazing -- but never distracting -- is how distinctive Baxter makes the different voices of all these characters. There is also great variety in the ways he can provide sheer entertainment. Even the book's throwaway lines manage to tickle: ''I pass by the health club. The manager is often outside, enjoying a cigarette.'' ''We talked about books, how boring they were to read but how you loved them anyway.'' ''You can have good sex on your honeymoon and still suspect that there's something fishy going on.''</p>
        <p>Baxter shows equal felicity with male and female characters, making this evenhandedness look so natural that you forget how few writers are similarly skilled. Which is not to say that each of his characters gets the same amount of attention. In his earlier novels, Baxter stared with equal fervor at every member of his cast. In this book, he seems to have relaxed and admitted that some people are simply more interesting than others, and he has weighted his narrative accordingly.</p>
        <p>As in Russell Banks's sadder novel ''The Sweet Hereafter,'' the unusual round-robin structure of ''The Feast of Love'' only intensifies the book's sense of human interconnectedness. If, in Baxter's past work, you occasionally got the sense that his approach was determining the story, rather than vice versa, this is never the case in his new novel, which is as loose and supple as life itself.</p>
        <p>There's been so much talk recently about this or that ''community'' on the World Wide Web -- about this convenient group of consumers, say, or that consortium of information gatherers -- that I sometimes wonder if anyone remembers what the word really means. In ''The Feast of Love,'' Charles Baxter shows us the hard-won generosity of spirit that day-to-day dealings with other human beings require. He builds a community right on the page before us, using a glittering eye, a silvery tongue -- and just a little moonlight.</p>
