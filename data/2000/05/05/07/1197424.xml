        <p>Edmund Morris letter comments on Joseph Horowitz's April 23 article on Anthony Beaumont's completion of Feruccio Busoni opera 'Doktor Faust'</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Joseph Horowitz writes that Antony Beaumont's completion of Ferruccio Busoni's ''Doktor Faust'' is ''perhaps less good'' than that of Philipp Jarnach ['' 'Doktor Faust' Captures a Composer's Paradoxes,'' April 23]. He is entitled to his opinion, but its uncertainty makes me wonder if he has experienced the Beaumont version in a live performance. I use the verb ''experienced,'' rather than ''heard,'' because the music of this opera, a true Gesamtkunstwerk, reflects and refracts the stage action so wholly as to be inseparable from it.</p>
        <p>Jarnach's ending, dashed off for ''Doktor Faust's'' first performance in 1925, makes no use of detailed musical instructions left by the dying composer. It amounts to about four minutes of dense Jarnach, whereas Mr. Beaumont's spacious final scene, realizing manuscript sketches as well as other original material from 1923 and 1924, is more or less pure Busoni. To some ears -- and eyes -- the purity is preferable.</p>

It amounts to about four minutes of dense Jarnach, whereas Mr. Beaumont's spacious final scene, realizing manuscript sketches as well as other original material from 1923 and 1924, is more or less pure Busoni. To some ears -- and eyes -- the purity is preferable.</p>
        <p>As Alfred Brendel, an avowed Beaumont partisan, notes in his book ''Music Sounded Out,'' the opera's final image is Nietzschean. A naked youth rises from the ruined body of Faust, shucking off old and constraining superstitions. That white innocence, symbolic of Busoni's yearning for a newborn classicism in the aftermath of World War I, is best expressed in the radiant key of C major -- toward which all his visionary music tends. Mr. Beaumont allows ''Doktor Faust'' to ''rise'' and rarify thus, whereas Jarnach almost perversely forces it down to E flat minor, the blackest of all keys.</p>
        <p>I was fortunate enough to see a production of ''Doktor Faust'' conducted by Mr. Beaumont in London 14 years ago, and can testify to the rapture of the audience as the final transfiguration took place.</p>
