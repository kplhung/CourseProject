        <p>The decline of the Detroit Red Wings was verified Friday night when they were eliminated again from the Stanley Cup playoffs by the Colorado Avalanche, this time in five games, in a 4-2 finale. After consecutive championships in 1997 and 1998, the Wings have twice exited in the second round of the four-round tournament.</p>
        <p>The Avalanche, which also bounced the Wings last spring, will meet either Dallas or San Jose in the Western Conference finals. With Ray Bourque healing on defense, Peter Forsberg robust at forward and Patrick Roy both quick and cocky in goal, the Avalanche might make the finals for the first time since it won the cup in 1996.</p>

        <p>The decline of the Detroit Red Wings was verified Friday night when they were eliminated again from the Stanley Cup playoffs by the Colorado Avalanche, this time in five games, in a 4-2 finale. After consecutive championships in 1997 and 1998, the Wings have twice exited in the second round of the four-round tournament.</p>
        <p>The Avalanche, which also bounced the Wings last spring, will meet either Dallas or San Jose in the Western Conference finals. With Ray Bourque healing on defense, Peter Forsberg robust at forward and Patrick Roy both quick and cocky in goal, the Avalanche might make the finals for the first time since it won the cup in 1996.</p>
        <p>There is no shame for the Wings, despite several tacky displays of frustration on Friday. They are still a good regular-season club but no longer of the top echelon in the postseason. The team's captain, Steve Yzerman, with no goals in the tournament, is near that career stage where age -- he turns 35 on Tuesday -- and injuries begin to blend, much as they did for Wayne Gretzky in his New York era.</p>
        <p>On defense, no matter how many Chris Chelioses and Steve Duchesnes they collect, the Red Wings cannot fill the void left by the tragic loss of Vladimir Konstantinov, paralyzed in a limo crash while celebrating the first title. And what about behind the bench, where Coach Scotty Bowman still seeks his record-breaking ninth ring?</p>
        <p>In his experienced way, Bowman has let it be known through others that it would be interesting for the Rangers to consider him for the general manager's and coach's vacancies. Bowman held the two jobs, in various combinations, in Buffalo, in the 1980's, without great success. Even at age 66, he still has something to prove. This is not to say the Rangers would offer Bowman all this power or that he would accept it, or that the Wings would make it easy to leave.</p>
        <p>It is just an intriguing thought, better than the possibilities planted in the rumors involving Glen Sather and Colin Campbell.</p>
        <p>In the other Western bracket, Dallas took a 3-1 lead over San Jose with a ragged 5-4 victory on Friday. The San Jose team is a sports rarity: a scrappy underdog difficult to like. Maybe it's the belligerence of Owen Nolan, the menace of Bryan Marchment or the constant tripping, spearing, slashing and shoving of a dozen other Sharks. Marchment left with an injury Friday and Nolan played in evident discomfort. So the Sharks should fall out in Game 5 today, just as they should have fallen to the Blues in the first round.</p>
        <p>The Avalanche will probably hope that San Jose can extend the Stars for another game or two, wearing down the Dallas veterans, maybe injuring one or two of them, while Colorado rests. Rarely elegant or charismatic -- despite stylists like Mike Modano, Brett Hull and Sergei Zubov -- the Stars, like Detroit in 1998, know what it takes to repeat. But, can they do it?</p>
        <p>In the East, the Devils struggled but prevailed by 4-3 last night in Toronto. New Jersey's Scott Gomez, slumping earlier in the series, dished the puck with confidence to new linemates and played like the probable winner of the Calder Trophy for rookie of the year. Defenseman Vladimir Malakhov, inconsistent in previous games, scored a goal and displayed his wide array of skills. The Devils, superior most of this series, lead by only three games to two and can reach the conference finals with one more victory tomorrow night in New Jersey. Should the Leafs win tomorrow, they get Game 7 at home on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Whoever wins must meet the winner of the wacky Philadelphia-Pittsburgh series, which resumes today, tied at two victories each, on the ABC network at noon. The Flyers' 2-1 victory in five overtimes Thursday night should give them momentum. But no home team has won yet in this matchup. In this round of eight, these teams bring the best narrative and cast of characters.</p>
        <p>If it isn't Roger Neilson's cancer recovery and Eric Lindros's concussion problems, it is the emergence of the undrafted rookie Andy Delmore and the bullish determination of John LeClair and the brilliance of Jaromir Jagr and the re-emergence of Herb Brooks. This series in particular reminds even hockey knockers of why the Stanley Cup playoffs usually make for the best tournament of the sports year. These playoffs will be half complete this week, and they are starting to get really good.</p>
        <p>Speaking of good: Critics who constantly whine about poor hockey telecasts (see name at top of column) should be fair enough to notice when games are presented with flair and a knowing touch. Such was the case in the Detroit-Colorado series on ESPN. The camera work was an impressive blend of aggressiveness and restraint, the whole product as good as anything Hockey Night in Canada or MSG ever present. For those of the cult who make playoff viewing a nightly obsession, telecasts like these are a joy to behold.</p>
