        <p>THE opulent and mysterious lives of China's last imperial rulers can be glimpsed in the largest exhibition so far of national treasures from China's Imperial Palace, installed here in February at the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art.</p>
        <p>Most of the 350 artifacts in ''Secret World of the Forbidden City: Splendors From China's Imperial Palace,'' including gilt-edged ceremonial suits of armor, solid-gold flatware and gold-embroidered silk gowns, have not been seen before in North America or even in Beijing.</p>
        <p>Finding adequate exhibition space for permanent collections is a constant juggling act for most museum directors. At Beijing's showcase, the Forbidden City Palace Museum, the dilemma is different.</p>
        <p>The former Imperial Palace, the vast vermilion-red compound where Ming and Qing emperors and their courts lived beginning in 1407, is preserved largely as it was when the Qing dynasty ended in 1911. Without climate control to protect the extensive art collections and historical artifacts, such as gifts of state and household possessions, curators keep much of the palace's contents sealed in storage. The eight million tourists annually who tour the museum see only a central section where they mostly appreciate the grand architecture of three great ceremonial halls. A fraction of the collection is on display there, covered with dust and inadequately lighted by money-saving, low-watt bulbs.</p>
        <p>Located near Tiananmen Square, the 180-acre palace encircled by a moat and a 32-foot wall was for centuries a mysterious and secretive place. Most of its 999 buildings with their 9,999 rooms (an auspicious number in China) are still off limits. Because of limited resources, buildings that housed the imperial household -- the artisans, guards, concubines and eunuchs -- are locked and untended, with trees sprouting from some roof tops.</p>
        <p>Only in the last decade, as China's relations with the West have improved, has a portion of the Forbidden City collection been lent to smaller exhibitions in Paris and Amsterdam. Curators have turned instead to Taiwan's National Palace Museum, whose collection of imperial Chinese artifacts, seized from the Beijing palace by fleeing nationalists, is considered the best. The Taipei museum lent 450 items to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1996, provoking demonstrations in Taiwan over the removal of national treasures.</p>
        <p>Historically, Chinese art shown by mainstream United States institutions has focused on earlier periods more prized by experts. Vishakha N. Desai, senior vice president and gallery director of the Asia Society in New York, said of the Bowers exhibition, which has objects dating back to the 1600's, ''I think it's absolutely important to do a show like this.'' She added, however, that the Bowers's portrayal of an emperor's life should be appreciated for its educational value more than for its artistic value. ''Isn't it remarkable it hasn't happened before?'' she said.</p>
        <p>The show is drawing record crowds to the Bowers, which is housed in a Spanish-style hacienda near downtown Santa Ana, about 30 miles southeast of Los Angeles. It will travel to the Oakland Museum beginning Oct. 14 and to Houston's Museum of Natural Sciences in March 2001.</p>
        <p>The exhibition, a coup for a small museum, had its origin in a display of military court costumes that the museum's president, Peter C. Keller, saw in Amsterdam in 1992 and coveted for the Bowers, which tries to play host to an Asian exhibit annually. But it would not have been won without the efforts of a persistent volunteer.</p>
        <p>The behind-the-scenes organizer was the Taiwan-born Anne Shih, 45, the founder of a Chinese language school in Fountain Valley, Calif., and a member of the museum's board.</p>
        <p>Her first success was bringing to the Bowers a jade exhibit in 1997, with the best pieces from a dozen private Taiwanese collections, which also traveled to museums in Houston and Washington. Before a trip to Beijing that year, Mrs. Shih asked Mr. Keller if she could be of any help again.</p>
        <p>As curator of the Los Angeles County Natural History Museum, he had previously tried to borrow collections from museums in Taiwan and China and got nowhere. ''The big piece of the puzzle I didn't know was the only way of getting anywhere was to send a director,'' Mr. Keller said. Sending one who was charming, persistent and fluent in Chinese didn't hurt, either.</p>
        <p>Over the last three years, and eight trips to China, Mrs. Shih was able to accomplish as a volunteer what American museum officials could not. ''They took us into parts of the Forbidden City that hadn't been opened in decades,'' Mr. Keller said, adding that he and Mrs. Shih prowled the complex on bikes. ''Whenever they would show us something, Anne would say, 'Can we put it in the exhibit?' '' Eventually their picks filled a 747.</p>
        <p>Most negotiations were aimed at fulfilling Mr. Keller's notion of recreating the lives led by the 10 Qing (pronounced ching) emperors who reigned in the palace beginning in 1611. Each object was the subject of a separate negotiated agreement. Selecting the pieces was a laborious task, as the palace collection is estimated to include a million artifacts. The jade collection alone numbers 50,000, dwarfing the best-known collection in the West, the 2,500-piece Avery Brundage collection at the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco, Mr. Keller said. The exhibit will cost the Bowers $1.5 million over its seven months.</p>
        <p>CHINESE officials set a limit of 120 sets, which could be individual pieces or groups of similar objects. Ultimately, the Bowers's limited exhibit space and the jet's 10-ton weight limit forced the Bowers officials, working with the exhibit's curator, the Palace Museum director Yang Xin, to pare their selections, cutting large furniture pieces.</p>
        <p>Along the way, Mrs. Shih learned that Chinese officials had asked their consulate in Los Angeles to compile a dossier on her. ''They wanted to make sure I wasn't a spy,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Mistrust was not an issue for Palace Museum employees, though. Mrs. Shih won them over with her rule-bending suggestion that a succession of curators accompany the exhibit in the United States. Instead of a single three-person group staying for the duration, she proposed that teams come for three months at a time. ''I create an opportunity for you,'' she said, adding that visiting the West would be unlikely for most museum workers.</p>
        <p>Among the exhibit's most remarkable items are eight-foot-high 18th-century portraits of several emperors, their faces rendered in near-photographic detail.</p>
        <p>In one striking painting, instead of the dragon-ringed throne where the seven other rulers pose, the Qing Emperor Qianlong is outfitted in battle regalia astride a horse. Though unsigned, the portrait's Western style suggests the hand of the famed Giuseppe Castiglione, an Italian Jesuit missionary who worked as a Chinese court painter.</p>
        <p>''Those are treasures,'' said John E. Wills Jr., a professor of Asian history at the University of Southern California and a featured speaker in  the lecture series that coincides with the exhibit. ''I was surprised to see them.''</p>
        <p>Another one-of-a-kind object on display is a pearl-studded golden statue of Maitreya, a Buddhist figure that distills the cosmopolitan Qing dynasty culture. ''It encompasses several traditions: the sensuality of India's art, the formality of Tibetan art and the serenity of Chinese art,'' said Janet Baker, the Bowers's curator of Asian art.</p>
        <p>The exhibit conveys an emperor's life through palace scenes. It includes recreations of a formal throne room; a study that includes scientific instruments and carved red lacquer writing tools; a dining room with solid gold implements; a wardrobe area for ceremonial robes embellished with gold and pearls, and a bed chamber complete with wash basin and silk-cushioned toilet. An adjoining room holds suits of military armor and armaments and a scale model of the Forbidden City.</p>
        <p>''The room settings were intelligently developed'' and provide an instructive way to understand Chinese history, Mr. Wills said.</p>
        <p>During the exhibit's stay in Santa Ana, the museum's interior courtyard has taken on a new ambience as a Chinese crafts festival. Artisans, such as kite makers, calligraphers and embroiderers, demonstrate and sell their wares in outdoor booths.</p>
        <p>Among the initial artists was the master calligrapher and painter Zhang Xihe from Henan province, whose professional name is Magic Clay Monkey Maker. Using a wood sliver dipped in two hues of ink as a brush, Mr. Zhang charmed children by rendering the English letters of their names in a scroll of delicate flowers and feathered and webbed creatures. His charge: $5 and a photograph taken with his patrons.</p>
        <p>A serendipitous conversation with palace curators yielded the exhibit's most humanizing display: a cricket cage, a bicycle and a music box, personal possessions of Pu-Yi, China's last emperor, who ascended the throne at age 3. ''These appeal to our American fascination with ordinary objects,'' Ms. Baker said, ''valuable not because of what they are but because of who used them.''</p>
