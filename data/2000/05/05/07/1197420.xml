        <p>FRED TREGASKIS, who builds wine cellars for a living, said he remembered when city restaurants were the sum total of his clientele. That was in the early 1990's. Now the West Cornwall contractor is more likely to find work at private homes in lower Fairfield and Westchester Counties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tregaskis, owner of New England Wine Cellars, said he built about 40 cellars last year, his biggest year ever. Design Build Consultants, a Greenwich builder of wine cellars, also said last year was its biggest. ''Cellars have become the rage in new construction,'' Mr. Tregaskis said. ''I've built several cellars in nice homes where the client wasn't an avid wine collector, but felt their home wasn't complete unless it had a wine cellar.''</p>

        <p>FRED TREGASKIS, who builds wine cellars for a living, said he remembered when city restaurants were the sum total of his clientele. That was in the early 1990's. Now the West Cornwall contractor is more likely to find work at private homes in lower Fairfield and Westchester Counties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tregaskis, owner of New England Wine Cellars, said he built about 40 cellars last year, his biggest year ever. Design Build Consultants, a Greenwich builder of wine cellars, also said last year was its biggest. ''Cellars have become the rage in new construction,'' Mr. Tregaskis said. ''I've built several cellars in nice homes where the client wasn't an avid wine collector, but felt their home wasn't complete unless it had a wine cellar.''</p>
        <p>Or had a wine cellar with a wide-screen television or a spiral staircase, as some do. These cellars can also come with mood lighting, secret paneled entrances and antique decorative knickknacks.</p>
        <p>''They want hand-forged hardware on their door and old-fashioned lighting,'' Mr. Tregaskis said. They also often want a medieval Italian look: ''Tuscany. I hear that word all the time.''</p>
        <p>As both the cost of and demand for fine wine rise to unprecedented levels in the United States, with a record $18.1 billion of wine sold in 1999, having a place at home to store it safely has become a high priority for some.</p>
        <p>Adam Strum, chairman of the Wine Enthusiast, a wine-accessory catalog company in Hawthorne, N.Y., said sales of its custom built cellars rose from 234 in 1998 to 397 last year. In the first quarter of this year, he said demand was more than double what it was at this time last year. Christine Hawley of Manhattan, who has designed cellars in Greenwich and the Hamptons, said the strong economy had a lot to do with it.</p>
        <p>''The economy has been so good, people already have as many cars as they can drive, as many homes as they can go to,'' Ms. Hawley said. ''One thing people haven't experienced is the newest pleasure left, which is wine cellars.''</p>
        <p>Once, not long ago, a wine cellar was thought of as a rack under the basement stairs. But today the trend is more in line with Tony Sanfilippo's home cellar in Westport, a 10-by-12-foot space with a tasting table, a tumbled-marble floor and a chandelier with colored glass cut to resemble a grapevine.</p>
        <p>''It's somewhat in the eye of the beholder, but it does give me pleasure,'' Mr. Sanfilippo said. The cellar, which can hold close to 2,000 bottles, cost about $50,000 to build.</p>
        <p>Matt Kramer, a columnist for Wine Spectator magazine and author of the ''Making Sense'' series of wine books, said the increase in cellars correlated with the rise in interest in drinking wine.</p>
        <p>''The more people get involved with wine, the more they realize that storage matters,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Paul Wyatt, a designer who runs the Fine Wine Rack and Cellar Company in San Carlos, Calif., which provides supplies for cellars around the country, said the greater New York area was one of six regions of the United States where the cellar market was strongest.</p>
        <p>''Volume is going up every year,'' he said. ''Periodically, I get so busy I can't see straight, so I raise my prices and volume goes up again.''</p>
        <p>Evan Goldenberg of Design Build Consultants attributed the strong demand to the rise in the stock market. Mr. Sanfilippo is executive vice president of the brokerage firm Knight/ Trimark Group of Jersey City, N.J., and among Mr. Goldenberg's other clients are many with similar connections to the world of finance.</p>
        <p>Driving through the Round Hill section of Greenwich with Mr. Goldenberg can become monotonous as he points out various streets and calculates how many cellars he has built along each. Lawrence Calcano, a managing director at Goldman Sachs, hired Mr. Goldenberg to build a cellar with a 5,000-bottle capacity at his Greenwich home. He declined to say how much it cost, but said it provided ''flexibility'' in choosing wines for the right occasion.</p>
        <p>''To me it's not that complicated,'' he said. ''It's a real fun thing, a real social thing. It's great to be able to share your passion with family and friends.''</p>
        <p>William Driscoll, a forest-products industry executive in Riverside, a section of Greenwich, has a cellar with a 1,700-bottle capacity. Unostentatious, with a hunk of ledge rock coming out of the floor that Mr. Driscoll prizes for the added humidity, the cellar is ''a great comfort,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Many times at the end of a busy day I just go in and close myself in,'' he said. ''It's like going back to the womb.''</p>
        <p>The cellar also means that Mr. Driscoll doesn't have to rush to drink his finest bottles. ''In the late 80's and early 90's, you were forced to drink California Cabernets too early because you didn't have the space to store them,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some higher-end clients want elaborate cabinets instead of racks for their bottles, creating what Mr. Goldenberg calls ''a library for wine.''</p>
        <p>He said his projects tended to be expensive, largely because he works with sophisticated refrigeration equipment with temperature-sensitive alarm systems and low-voltage electronic controls.</p>
        <p>''Things really started to pick up in 1996,'' he said. ''Projects had been in the $25,000 to $35,000 range. Then they quickly graduated to the $45,000 to $55,000 range. I'd have clients call me to say they moved and needed a new wine cellar. I'd have other clients tell me they ran out of space and needed another wine cellar.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most unusual wine cellar in Connecticut is the commercial one Jed and Amie Benedict have created in Stafford. It is a former bomb shelter built during the cold war for record-keeping by Hartford banks and insurance companies. It comes with a 12-ton steel safe door, diesel generator, 3,000-gallon fuel tank, and rear escape hatch.</p>
        <p>The Benedicts are marketing themselves to restaurants, liquor stores and private collectors willing to rent space for wine storage in the 100,000-square-foot cellar, now called Horse Ridge Cellars. Because the cellar is 15 feet underground, naturally cool and vibration-free, the Benedicts see wine storage as a natural fit. In addition, when it comes to long-term commercial wine storage, Ms. Benedict said, ''there is nothing else in New England at all.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Benedict added: ''This was built in 1962 for $330,000. Now if you wanted to do all this, the cost would be $2 million to $3 million. The walls, ceiling and floor are all two-foot thick steel-reinforced concrete.''</p>
        <p>So far, restaurants haven't signed up, but Horse Ridge has landed private collectors from Greenwich, Glastonbury and Avon.</p>
        <p>While cellars can certainly be a conduit to exploring a personal passion, for others, they're a smart investment.</p>
        <p>''They're a very hot item now,'' said David Ogilvy, who owns a real estate firm in Greenwich. ''What sells houses are things like condition and master bedrooms, but a wine cellar is a really nice piece of cake.''</p>
        <p>Wine cellars can pay off in other ways. David Koch, executive vice president of Koch Industries, a company in Wichita, Kan., whose South Hampton, N.Y., cellar was designed by Ms. Hawley, noted that many of the wines he had stored had gone up in value three or four times since he purchased them 10 years ago. ''I may get enough off these bottles to justify the original cost of the cellar,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Michael Davis, head of the North American wine department at Sotheby's International, said: ''A lot of people are keeping wine as an investment, and they are doing quite well. What I see is the ideal cycle of wine collecting. As wines mature, people prune their cellar. A cellar can become self-funding that way, by selecting things as they reach their level of maturity and reinvesting in young wines.''</p>
        <p>Private collectors said the economics make sense.</p>
        <p>''All you have to do is look at the auction world,'' said David Pedowitz, an investment adviser from Bedford, N.Y., with a 5,000-bottle cellar Mr. Goldenberg built for $75,000. ''The finest wines are now outrageously expensive because of the supply and demand curves. You have to search for the supply, and supply is only going to come from people storing wines.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Hawley said she believed that wine collecting was about more than drinking or investing. It can provide entree into a world where one becomes a ''connoisseur of life.''</p>
        <p>''When you start building a cellar, a lot of things change in your life,'' she said. ''You think about going to wine countries for vacations. You start going to wine auctions. Your friends change, because you're more focused on people who love wine. Your diet changes, because you want food that goes with your wine. It's like having a baby. I see people get so energized and focused.''</p>
