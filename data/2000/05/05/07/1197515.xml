        <p>A dozen Shinnecock dancers in ceremonial dress performed and gave a blessing. The actor Alec Baldwin, County Executive Robert Gaffney and Town Supervisor Jay Schneiderman spoke. Then Mr. Baldwin snipped a ribbon and the new Pinewood West Soundstage in Wainscott was officially open for the business of making the Hamptons a place for the stars of the film industry to work as well as live and play.</p>
        <p>With 45-foot ceilings and 18,000 square feet of studio space, the new soundstage is the largest indoor filming space in the region and would not be out of place at a Hollywood studio. But if there was a theme to Monday's dedication ceremony just south of East Hampton Airport, it was not that Hollywood is coming to the Hamptons, but that the Hamptons' growing community of creative movie and media people will now be able to stay home and make films.</p>

        <p>With 45-foot ceilings and 18,000 square feet of studio space, the new soundstage is the largest indoor filming space in the region and would not be out of place at a Hollywood studio. But if there was a theme to Monday's dedication ceremony just south of East Hampton Airport, it was not that Hollywood is coming to the Hamptons, but that the Hamptons' growing community of creative movie and media people will now be able to stay home and make films.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to go to Canada,'' declared Mr. Baldwin, an Amagansett resident. What he would like to do, he said, is make movies ''out here,'' using ''our own local people.''</p>
        <p>Frazer Dougherty, the owner of the new soundstage, said that Mr. Baldwinhas said he wants to shoot a remake of ''The Devil and Daniel Webster'' in Wainscott but has yet to make a firm commitment. More likely to be the first one in the door at Pinewood West, Mr. Dougherty said, is Amanda Hunter, whose Sag Harbor production company is about to start filming ''The Mande Dahl Show,'' a sitcom for teenagers.</p>
