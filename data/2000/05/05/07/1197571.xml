        <p>MAYBE Jay Pearsall harbors some sort of death wish. He has, after all, been steeped in murder and mayhem for more than 10 years as the proprietor of Murder Ink, the Upper West Side mystery bookstore.</p>
        <p>But the wholesome-looking Mr. Pearsall, who just opened a second store selling new and used books, insists he isn't suicidal, just hooked on a business that can be as intensely personal and satisfying as, well, a crime of passion.</p>
        <p>''I could make more money in an easier way dealing rare books out of my apartment,'' he said. ''But there's something, you know, in my blood to collect these books and turn them around.''</p>
        <p>Like Murder Ink, the two-month-old Ivy's Books and Curiosities is brimming with charm, uncommon titles and advice aplenty from a well-read staff. The two shops are connected on Broadway, between 92nd and 93rd Streets, and each has its share of antiques and friendly nuzzles from Gus, Mr. Pearsall's wirehaired pointing griffon. So far, he said, ''No one has expressed anything but glee about having something other than another mediocre restaurant or Godiva chocolate.''</p>
        <p>By pumping profits from Murder Ink into a new store just 10 blocks north of Barnes &amp; Noble, Mr. Pearsall has taken a big risk. But it seems to be one that other independent booksellers are taking, too, despite a shellacking over the last several years from Barnes &amp; Noble, Borders and Amazon.com.</p>
        <p>The decline in independent bookstores, from a nationwide peak of 5,400 in the early 1990's to 3,200 today, has tapered off during the last two years, according to the American Booksellers Association. Although the association does not break out separate figures for New York City, there is anecdotal evidence to suggest that indies are cautiously reopening their doors to readers starved for face-to-face contact.</p>
        <p>Only 76 independent bookstores remain in all five boroughs, according to an association Web site (www.bookweb.org), and many of those are part of museums and other cultural centers. But for every lost icon like Endicott Booksellers, Watson's and Burlington, there is an Ivy's, a Crawford-Doyle and a Posman's, according to Carl Lennertz, a marketing consultant at the association's headquarters in Tarrytown, N.Y.</p>
        <p>Shakespeare &amp; Co., whose flagship store at Broadway and 81st Street closed after Barnes &amp; Noble opened a block away, has not only re-emerged on the Upper East Side (near Hunter College), but is also becoming a small chain of its own. After regaining a foothold at Lexington Avenue and 68th Street, Shakespeare has opened branches near Baruch College (in the East 20's), near Wall Street, in Greenwich Village and, most recently, in the Brooklyn Academy of Music.</p>
        <p>''Any new retailing phenomenon runs out of gas after a while,'' Mr. Lennertz said. ''It's one thing to buy a discounted best seller, and it's another to go in and ask, 'What should my book club read?' ''</p>
        <p>Personal service is clearly the strength of independent mainstays like the Corner Bookstore, at Madison Avenue and 93rd Street since 1978. On a recent Saturday, pink and red carnations brightened the shop's windows while loyal customers politely vied for space at the cash register.</p>
        <p>Carol Vanderkloot, a publicist, snapped up several children's classics for her niece's sixth birthday while Kent Lombard, a perfume chemist, and his wife, Randy, an interior designer, bought ''The Horse and His Boy'' by C. S. Lewis for their 7-year-old son, Hunter.</p>
        <p>When ''The Horse and His Boy,'' the third volume in the Chronicles of Narnia, wasn't readily available recently, the store's workers advised not skipping ahead.</p>
        <p>''They didn't press us for another sale, but ordered it for us and called as soon as it came in,'' said Ms. Lombard, adding, ''I don't mind paying a little more money for the service.''</p>
        <p>The Corner Bookstore's staying power may also stem from the fact that the proprietor, Lenny Golay, and her husband, Ray Sherman, own the four-story building where it is situated (and where they live). Two years ago, the couple opened a second store, the Lenox Hill Bookstore, on Lexington Avenue between 72nd and 73rd Streets.</p>
        <p>Commercial rents have put a lot of stores out of business, said Fern Jaffe, who has owned Paperbacks Plus in the Riverdale section of the Bronx for three decades. Her core customers, Ms. Jaffe said, are neighborhood residents who shop along Riverdale Avenue, have known her for years and are now buying books for their children and grandchildren. ''The money we're making today is based on a capital investment of old money,'' she said.</p>
        <p>FINANCIAL independence also gave rise about five years ago to Crawford-Doyle, at Madison and 81st Street, whose chatty co-owner, John Doyle, is a retired I.B.M. executive and an avid reader.</p>
        <p>''It's really not an economic enterprise anymore,'' Mr. Doyle said of the book business. ''It's a labor of love.''</p>
        <p>The store grossed just under $1 million last year and barely broke even, Mr. Doyle said. But as he sees it, his staff gets decent wages and he and his wife, Judy Crawford, are able to dine with authors and chat with celebrity walk-ins like Emma Thompson.</p>
        <p>Less secure but just as passionate are the operators of Nkiru, a Brooklyn landmark that has specialized in African-American literature since 1976. Talib Kweli Greene and Dante Smith, a hip-hop duo known as Black Star, bought the bookstore in 1998 with the advance from their first album. But competition, plus a $3,000 monthly rent, proved too much for them. The shop, on St. Mark's Avenue in Park Slope, was recently revamped into a nonprofit education and cultural center.</p>
        <p>''You just can't rely on walk-ins,'' said Dr. Brenda M. Greene, Mr. Greene's mother, who now runs the center. Dr. Greene also heads the department of languages, literature and philosophy at Medgar Evers College. Current plans for Nkiru include an expanded selection of multicultural literature, writing seminars and weekend hip-hop performances.</p>
        <p>Clearly, establishing a niche is critical. PosmanBooks, which started out as a purveyor of college textbooks, has successfully expanded into the general retail market while clinging to its collegiate roots and finding specialized markets.</p>
        <p>Maxene Posman, the president of PosmanBooks, said that the family had doubled its business in the last few years. Though the company still specializes in college bookstores, Posman's three general trade stores have also carved out their own niches. The Grand Central store, for example, offers a wide range of management-training books for employees of nearby corporations.</p>
        <p>Most independent bookstores also have Web sites or are developing them. But several booksellers said they had little expectation of reaping much profit on the Net and were going high tech mainly to support www.booksense.com, a Web site that is part of the booksellers association's national campaign to help its members compete online.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pearsall, for one, clearly prefers selling books in person, and the intimacy of his stores may be hard to resist. But even his most appreciative customers go high tech and low-rent once in a while.</p>
        <p>''I love the feel of this store,'' said Erin Moriarty, a reporter for ''48 Hours,'' who was prowling for a new mystery recently at Murder Ink.</p>
        <p>''How could you not? But I also love the mix of books and people at Barnes &amp; Noble, and I also order books online. I'm an equal opportunist.''</p>
