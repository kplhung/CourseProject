        <p>SCHOOL enrollments are burgeoning around the state, and cities and towns are scrambling to find space in which to put all these students. Some are reopening long-closed schools; others are building new ones.</p>
        <p>In Stamford, officials are trying something different. With high school enrollment expected to jump in the city by about 1,000 over the next six years, officials have their eyes on a school building at Scalzi Park that has room for about 800 students. The site would be perfect. The problem is, there is already a high school there. The school, J. M. Wright Regional Vocational Technical School, is run by the state, and if Stamford takes the building, its 459 students would have to find another place to go.</p>
        <p>''It's like someone saying, 'I like your house, and I want to buy it,' '' said Diane Bauby, Wright's principal. ''And I'm saying it's not for sale.''</p>
        <p>Enid Ogiba, who teaches a nursing-assistant program at Wright, called the city's plan to close Wright irresponsible.</p>
        <p>''I think it's totally unfair to the kids who are here,'' she said. ''Not everyone is going to go to college and be a C.E.O. or a lawyer or a doctor. These are people who like to work with their hands.''</p>
        <p>Several weeks ago the Stamford Board of Education approved a resolution that would ask the State Legislature to vote to shut down Wright. Stamford wants the building since its two public high schools, Westhill High School and Stamford High School, are at capacity with a total of 3,800 students. Schools Superintendent Anthony Malluzzo said that over the next six years the high school enrollment was expected to grow to a total of 4,500 to 5,000 students.</p>
        <p>Mr. Malluzzo and board members fault Wright for outdated programs. Backed by Mayor Daniel Malloy, they charge that the school lags behind technologically, and its graduates are not suited to fill the city's service needs. They also said that the school had an enrollment of only 459 students, only 290 of them from Stamford.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mazzullo blamed the school's low enrollment on ''inadequate and outdated programs.'' He said that only 19 Stamford middle school students had enrolled for the coming fall.</p>
        <p>''If you talk to anybody, they will say that Wright Tech had an outstanding reputation at one time,'' said Mr. Malluzzo. ''But that is no longer the case. The reputation has declined in the past 10 years. And if a facility is not using the state taxpayers' money properly, then the state should turn it over to the municipality.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Bauby said while she sympathized with the Stamford school system's space needs, shutting down Wright would be a disservice to all southwestern Connecticut students with a need and an aptitude for hands-on learning. And she blames the Stamford school system, in part, for Wright's low enrollment.</p>
        <p>''I think Stamford's ploy this year was not to give out any applications to Wright Tech,'' she said. ''Kids who are enrolled here, who want their brothers and sisters to come here, say they can't find applications at the middle schools.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mazzullo admitted this was the case, saying, ''My guidance counselors will not send kids there.''</p>
        <p>In addition to outmoded technology, he criticized the way Wright's courses are structured, with three weeks of academics followed by three weeks of lab.</p>
        <p>''If you ask any teacher, they will tell you that after three weeks away, students forget what they learned in algebra,'' he said. ''It should be one day on, one day off.''</p>
        <p>Wright offers concentrations in 13 trades, including auto mechanics, machine technology, electrical engineering, electronics, hairdressing, plumbing, micro-computer technology, food service and culinary arts. Ms. Bauby, who became principal two years ago, admitted that Wright had lagged behind technologically. But, she said, all of that was changing. She toured the school and pointed out that computer diagnostics were now part of the auto-mechanics program. Computer-assisted drafting is used in the machine shop, and a computer program called Learning Logic is integral to the algebra program.</p>
        <p>''We now have students who want to stay after school to use these computers,'' said Trevor Jones, who heads Wright's math and science department.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jones, who has been at Wright for 17 years, said that the quality of schooling at Wright began to deteriorate during the 1980's. He said the decline was due in part to a high turnover in teachers and administrators. But now, he said, the school was on the rebound. Other plans to attract more students include expanding the school's athletic programs, an expanded summer school and an aggressive advertising campaign.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to believe they are going to make revisions in their programs, but not to the level that I would want,'' said Mr. Mazzullo. ''I have pledged to make the Stamford public schools the best in the state. I'm moving at lightning speed. And they're moving at a snail's pace.''</p>
        <p>It is this very academic drive in lower Fairfield County, where so much emphasis is placed on test scores and the number of students who go on to college, that has made a trade school like Wright seem dispensable, the school's supporters said. About 44 percent of the school's graduates go onto higher education, Ms. Bauby said. Mr. Mazzullo said 85 percent of Stamford high school graduates went on to college.</p>
        <p>''I'm professionally disappointed'' about the takeover plan, said Dominick Spera, superintendent of the Connecticut Vocational Technical School System, which runs the state's technical schools. ''I'm concerned, and at the same time I understand the city's need for space with a growing enrollment.</p>
        <p>''I understand it, but not at the expense of a regional school that serves more than Stamford,'' he added. ''There's a myth of what technical education is. My dad was a graduate of Wright Tech, and he later went on to be a teacher.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spera stressed that every technical school student had to fulfill an academic core curriculum to graduate. He said they were awarded ''dual diplomas, both academic and trade-technical,'' which could prepare them for work, college or a job and part-time, post-secondary education.</p>
        <p>Richard Brantley, a senior who takes two buses and a train to Wright from Bridgeport, said he didn't want the school to close.</p>
        <p>''I would be very upset if it closed,'' he said. ''All of the lowerclassmen would have wasted their time coming here.''</p>
        <p>Martin Levine, a Stamford school board member, said that while the other 18 state vocational-technical schools were thriving, Wright's enrollment was low because of its poor operation. In fact, he said it was the school's declining enrollment that prompted Gov. John G. Rowland several years ago to recommend shutting down Wright, a move that was thwarted by Stamford legislators. Mr. Levine said their support sprang from emotion over the school's long history in the city.</p>
        <p>Established as the Stamford Trade School on the city's West Side in the early 1900's, it was named in 1945 after John M. Wright, the former president of the Electric Specialty Company. The present Scalzi Park building was constructed in 1959.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levine acknowledged that in a world where technology changes daily, schools cannot be expected to be cutting edge. ''But I'd say they're 30 years behind the times,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still, some question whether the city would be so critical if it did not need the building.</p>
        <p>''Probably we wouldn't be disposed to making an issue out of it,'' Mr. Levine said. ''How that school is run is not our responsibility.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Malluzzo said his interest in taking over Wright was based on his concern for Stamford students who go there.</p>
        <p>''We will take care of our space needs with or without the Wright campus,'' he said.</p>
        <p>One possibility might be the city's Rippowam Center, the former Rippowam High School, where Mr. Mazzullo said he envisioned establishing a public technology academy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Spera said Stamford might have to settle for another location.</p>
        <p>''We are not closing, and not only are we not closing, we are adding new technology programs,'' he said. ''Our commitment remains stronger than ever to serve the students, and if that means more students coming from other towns, so be it.''</p>
