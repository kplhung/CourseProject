        <p>Scenic Hudson's third annual nine-day Great River sweep ends today, after 125 cleanups in more than 100 Hudson River communities. In the event's first weekend, volunteers collected more than 20,000 pounds of garbage from the riverfront. Groups taking part range from 5 to 200 people. Several communities, including Beacon, organized celebrations with the folk singer Pete Seeger performing a song called ''Garbage.'' Along with conventional trash items, volunteers found old appliances, toasters, microwaves, typewriters and a bottle of teeth.</p>
