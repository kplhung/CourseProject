        <p>All the participants quoted in the debate gaze upon the murals from street level; they should try an above-ground perspective.</p>
        <p>From my apartment on the northeast corner of Houston and Wooster Streets, I enjoy an unobstructed view of no less than 12 such ads. In the privacy of my home, overlooking ground zero of Houston Street, I cannot look south or west out of any window and avoid seeing these murals.</p>

        <p>All the participants quoted in the debate gaze upon the murals from street level; they should try an above-ground perspective.</p>
        <p>From my apartment on the northeast corner of Houston and Wooster Streets, I enjoy an unobstructed view of no less than 12 such ads. In the privacy of my home, overlooking ground zero of Houston Street, I cannot look south or west out of any window and avoid seeing these murals.</p>
        <p>I invite the advertising signage advocates to visit me and experience first-hand the impact. I want to learn if the muralists enjoy the signs' aesthetic value when the signs are literally in their faces.</p>
        <p>For three years I have been protesting the muralization of Houston Street to city officials, claiming my right as a resident to live ''free from advertising.'' However, city building and landmark regulations only concern themselves with the view from street level.</p>
        <p>Thousands of New Yorkers living in the residential districts that border on nonresidential zones now find themselves surrounded by giant ads.</p>
