        <p>When the curtain dropped on Act II of ''Die Walkure'' the other evening, a smattering of applause rippled through the house. But seasoned Wagner fans realized that an embarrassing mistake had just occurred. Like angry Nibelungs, they erupted in shushes, silencing the misguided few. The curtain rose, and the music churned to its dramatic conclusion. Then came a thundering ovation.</p>
        <p>Not much distinguishes the fan from the fanatic when it comes to Richard Wagner's four-opera ''Ring'' cycle. They cheer, they weep, they arrive at the Metropolitan Opera in formal attire, wearing Wagner buttons and Viking helmets with horns sticking out. They leave emotionally spent. I am one of them.</p>
        <p>I fell under the spell of the ''Ring'' years ago but have always had trouble explaining its power to others. This spring, I went for the first time to all four operas in one week -- 20 hours at the Met -- and have some theories.</p>
        <p>From ''Star Wars'' to the Harry Potter series, fairy-tale fantasies pervade our movies, television and books. In these hardened times, we cannot seem to get enough of monsters, evil dwarfs, magic potions, invisibility cloaks, mystical weapons, heroes searching for their true identity and deliverance through the power of love. All these elements are in Wagner's Ring, but there is also something to which our culture has developed an immunity -- tragedy.</p>
        <p>The word ''tragic'' is overused today. Wars are tragic, shootings are tragic, a movie star's illness is tragic. But the ''Ring'' is up there with Aeschylus and Shakespeare. Its music, the most tragic anyone ever composed, makes almost concrete the Aristotelian abstractions of fatally flawed characters hurtling to their doom. At the Met, it is interesting to see the most privileged people of turn-of-the-century New York, an era of unbridled self-confidence, addicted to a work that glorifies the crushing of arrogant aspirations. Call it masochism or guilt, but there is something about the ''Ring'' that we need.</p>
        <p>It took more than 25 years for Wagner to conceive and realize the ''Ring'' cycle, a project he began as Europe recovered from a wave of political uprisings in 1848. At bottom, it is a work about a corrupt old order being overthrown, and the power of this idea embedded in the ''Ring'' has shadowed its history. George Bernard Shaw famously saw the ''Ring'' as a parable of capitalism's demise. In Israel, the debate still rages over whether to perform music that exalts an attempt by Wotan, leader of the gods, to sire a master race to save his expiring world.</p>
        <p>The affinities that Hitler and the Nazis found in Wagner make us more than a little uncomfortable. But we are drawn back to the redemptive message that in trying to rescue his world, and to create someone with the freedom to defy his will, Wotan sacrificially accelerates his own destruction.</p>
        <p>To see all four operas in one week is to be reminded of something astounding. Virtually every plot development involves a betrayal or act of vengeance. The primordial betrayal is the theft of gold from the Rhine at the opening of ''Das Rheingold,'' but in ''Gotterdammerung'' we learn that even before that, Wotan fashioned a spear from a bough of the World Ash Tree, sending the natural world into decline. In each of the three main operas, these developments are speeded by an act of drinking something -- water, a sleep potion, a taste of scalding dragon's blood, a memory drug.</p>
        <p>You also have to see all four operas together to realize that the emotional and philosophical fulcrum is in Act II of ''Die Walkure,'' the very act that ended prematurely the other evening. It is in this act that Wotan realizes the existential trap he is in. ''Obliged to honor every treaty as the protector of laws, by my bargains I am enslaved!'' he laments to Brunnhilde, his warrior daughter. ''How can I create a free spirit who, in defying me, does my will?''</p>
        <p>The deeply pessimistic vision of Wagner is not exactly fashionable nowadays. But which of us does not spend some time seeing the world gripped by a cycle of vengeance and decline? There is even an echo of the cataclysmic end of the ''Ring'' in our world of forests burning, glaciers melting and water engulfing the land.</p>
        <p>The well-dressed audience that staggers out at midnight returns to its triumphalist world. Perhaps it is easier for these operagoers to be optimistic after seeing the set of ''Gotterdammerung'' strewn with rubble, a distant sun and a handful of men and women -- are they survivors or mortals or symbols of the audience? -- peering over the ruins. The music weeps for the fate of the gods. But it makes us weep for ourselves.</p>
