        <p>GAIL THORSON'S life changed forever when she got the call that her son Matthew Gross had been shot at the top of the Empire State Building. That is why Ms. Thorson will join women from across the country as they come together in Washington, D.C., next Sunday, Mother's Day, to march for stronger gun control legislation.</p>
        <p>''It was the worst day of my life,'' recalled Ms. Thorson, who lives in New Preston. ''Matthew was shot through the head and he wasn't supposed to live.''</p>
        <p>A promising rock musician who had lived in Europe, Mr. Gross, who was 27 at the time, was showing a friend from Denmark the sights of New York City when the gunman opened fire. The friend, Christoffer Burmeister, was killed in the February 1997 incident.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Gross survived, ''he is struggling to put a life together for himself,'' his mother said. She declined to give details about her son's condition because of a pending lawsuit.</p>
        <p>''The man who shot my son walked into a gun shop and bought a .380 semiautomatic Beretta as if he were purchasing a quart of milk,'' said Ms. Thorson, an elementary school teacher. (Mr. Gross's assailant bought the gun in Florida, where he passed a background check for a criminal record.)</p>
        <p>Called the Million Mom March, the protest, organizers say, is a chance for mothers and others to voice outrage against gun violence. The group is calling for federal regulations mandating waiting periods before handgun purchases; registration of handguns; safety locks for handguns; extensive background checks of people trying to buy guns; and a limit on individual handgun purchases (not more than one a month).</p>
        <p>To be led by Hillary Rodham Clinton and the actress Rosie O'Donnell, the march is expected to attract 100,000 people, the organizers said. Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut and a longtime supporter of gun control, will also attend. For those who can't make it to Washington, there will be Million Mom events in other parts of the country.</p>
        <p>Motherhood, however, does not guarantee support for the march. Cathy Smittner, of North Haven, a grandmother, a competitive shooter and a certified pistol instructor for the National Rifle Association, said existing laws were enough to protect children and the general public.</p>
        <p>''I don't know what they're miffing and muffing about,'' Ms. Smittner said. ''These laws are already in effect; we have a pistol permit law. Our police department gives out safety locks.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Smittner, a North Haven police department secretary, stores her guns in a safe and teaches her 4-year-old grandson, who lives with her, about firearms safety.</p>
        <p>''A gun is a firearm, not a weapon,'' she said. ''A weapon can be a car or a baseball bat. Guns don't kill; it's the individual holding it. I don't feel there should be any more laws.''</p>
        <p>Gun laws vary widely from state to state. State Senator William Aniskovich, a Republican, said Connecticut had one of the toughest restrictions on gun ownership in the country and had passed a ban on assault weapons. While the state does not have handgun registration, it does require permits.</p>
        <p>''We have gun contol laws; the problem is that many people are not prosecuted for breaking them,'' Senator Aniskovich said. ''We pass feel-good legislation and we go at the problem from the margins rather than attacking the core issue, which is: how do you regulate gun ownership and gun use toward the end of public safety?''</p>
        <p>Organizers of the Million Mom march believe that uniform federal laws are the answer. Donna Dees-Thomases, a New Jersey mother, came up with the idea for the march last August, the day after the shooting at a Jewish community center day camp in California. She applied for a permit for the event and, with the help of a Web site, has engaged women across the country.</p>
        <p>Several busloads of Connecticut participants have registered for the march, said Beth DeRubeis of Hamden, the statewide coordinator. Many more are expected to travel to Washington by train and car. Representative DeLauro estimates that between 500 and 1,000 people from the state will take part.</p>
        <p>Hope Carloni, of Branford, will take her daughters, Charlotte, 11, and Hannah, 10, by train.</p>
        <p>''I've just had enough,'' Ms. Carloni said. ''It's disappointing that the legislators haven't taken a stand. There is no reason for anyone to own a handgun. I hope the march will get women to find out which of their legislators supports gun control. And then they need to vote for them. I hope the N.R.A. is terrified,'' she added.</p>
        <p>Bill Powers, a spokesman for the N.R.A., declined to discuss the organization's position on the march, saying he preferred to talk about subjects on which the two groups agreed, like child safety and safe communities. ''Talking about issues on which we do agree goes a lot further than walking down the street in Washington, D.C., and getting into a political tit for tat,'' Mr. Powers said.</p>
        <p>Ms. DeRubeis said she had received some e-mail messages from people who thought the event was about banning guns.</p>
        <p>''The biggest myth is that we're trying to disarm America,'' said Ms. DeRubeis, who lost a cousin to gun violence 10 years ago. ''We're looking to take guns away from the wrong people. We're a mobilizing group, not an antigun group.''</p>
        <p>Ms. DeRubeis said she was marching to make the world a safer place for her 18-month-old son. She wants laws forcing owners to safeguard their guns so that if her son goes to a neighbor's house to play, she doesn't have to worry about unsecured weapons. If cars are registered by law, why not guns, she asked.</p>
        <p>March organizers quote statistics that guns are the second leading cause of death for children, after car accidents, and that each day, 12 children are killed by guns. Guns remain the only consumer product that is not federally regulated by the Consumer Product Safety Commission, they said.</p>
        <p>In terms of manufacturing safety, Ms. Thorson added, ''there are four categories of regulations for teddy bears and none for guns.''</p>
        <p>Lisa Labella of Trumbull, the Fairfield County coordinator for the march, said that polls had shown that most Americans supported gun control.</p>
        <p>''It's time for people to stop saying 'tsk, tsk,' every time there is a shooting,'' said Ms. Labella, a mother of two and a part-time teacher. ''The states have a patchwork of laws. We need to have some consistent laws across the country and some real background checks. I decided that if I don't do something soon, it will directly affect me.''</p>
        <p>Until recently, those who wanted gun control were a silent majority, while the the N.R.A., was a powerful lobby in Washington, Ms. Labella said.</p>
        <p>But she believes that gun control advocates are making progress. In a deal with the federal government, Smith &amp; Wesson, the nation's largest handgun manufacturer, recently agreed to a wide range of restrictions on the manufacture, sale and distribution of its handguns in exchange for protection against liability lawsuits at the federal, state and local levels. Massachusetts recently passed consumer product regulations requiring child-proof trigger locks on guns sold there. Maryland also requires locks on new guns.</p>
        <p>At the federal level, the Senate passed a juvenile-crime bill with several gun control measures last year, following the shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. The bill included requirements that licensed gun dealers sell child-safety devices with every handgun and that all firearms buyers at gun shows undergo background checks. The House passed a version of the legislation without the gun control amendments, and the bill is still in a House-Senate conference committee. It is the committee's task to try to resolve the deep divide between Democratic and Republican legislators on the issue.</p>
        <p>''Requiring child-safety locks, closing the gun-show loophole and banning the importation of high-capacity ammunition clips are common sense steps we should take immediately,'' Representative DeLauro said in a statement concerning the bill's provisions. (The ''gun-show loophole'' refers to the fact that only licensed dealers are required to conduct background checks of buyers at gun shows; gun collectors can sell guns there without restrictions.)</p>
        <p>Ms. Carloni believes the Million Mom March will help mobilize Americans. ''Here is a huge group of mothers talking about gun control,'' she said. ''The effect of the march won't be immediate, but we are a starting point. Maybe it will get women out into their neighborhoods to start a conversation.''</p>
        <p>As Ms. Thorson knows, a shooting affects not just the victim, but also his friends, family and community.</p>
        <p>''Gun violence can happen to anyone,'' Ms. Thorson said. ''Given the climate of our society, shootings are predictable. I don't want what happened to my family to happen to anyone. Giving us a voice will make a difference.''</p>
