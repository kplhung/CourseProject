        <p>I have learned that these ''flexies,'' as the new signs are called, an average of 1,000 square feet of non-biodegradable vinyl, are dumped in Mexico at the end of their installation. Some are ''stored'' but are not really suited for reuse because of the temporary nature of each advertising campaign.</p>
        <p>This fact stayed in my mind as I viewed a series of natural and unnatural disaster scenes around the world: floods tornadoes, hurricanes and various wartime resettlements. Why can't these signs become tents? What a great project for groups of young architects either in school or as an American Institute of Architects pro bono effort.</p>
