        <p>Of the many contradictions that make American life so endlessly fascinating, few are more curious than those pertaining to money and success. The zeal to make money drives America's globally dominant economy. It has long been observed that in the absence of an aristocracy and the other insidious obfuscations of too much history, money has been the chief maker and marker of status and power.

        <p>Of the many contradictions that make American life so endlessly fascinating, few are more curious than those pertaining to money and success. The zeal to make money drives America's globally dominant economy. It has long been observed that in the absence of an aristocracy and the other insidious obfuscations of too much history, money has been the chief maker and marker of status and power. And if my profession is certain of one thing, it is the fact that a family's income matters greatly for the welfare and development of its children.</p>
        <p>It is odd, then, that so many Americans have always held money in suspicion. The Puritans were certain that it was the root of all evil, even as they flagellated themselves for making more and more of it. Leaders from Benjamin Franklin to Martin Luther King Jr. have warned of the dangers of materialism.</p>
        <p>Today, a substantial majority of Americans insist that they do not overvalue money as a measure of their success. What's more, they also deny the influence of money in the way they or their children turn out. The puzzle deepens when we observe that even African-Americans, as well as poorer and older people, are among those most inclined to deny such influences.</p>
        <p>What's going on? Are these people simply in denial? Or are they just misinformed?</p>
        <p>Perhaps it's a little of both. But I think something more complex is at play, having to do with the need to reconcile our deeply held beliefs about equality with the realities of inequality in America.</p>
        <p>America justified its declaration of independence with the startling principle that all people are self-evidently equal. Nonetheless, in the more than two centuries since this declaration, income inequality has grown, except for the period that began with the mid-1930's and ended with the late 1960's. This growth in inequality has been accompanied by an extension of democracy far beyond what prevailed in Jefferson's day. And yet, contrary to the fears of postrevolutionary leaders that a tyrannous majority would inevitably soak the rich, for most periods of American history, including our own, political power has rarely been used to reduce inequality. Why is that?</p>
        <p>There is little support for the cynical view that Americans don't really take their egalitarian ideal seriously. They do, and what's more, nearly half consider present economic inequalities morally wrong. As someone who has known or lived with the invidious injuries of the British class system, the ostentatious iniquities of Caribbean color-class hierarchies with their ''one people'' cant, not to mention Brazilian apartheid with its Orwellian double-speak of ''racial democracy,'' I'll take the dilemmas of American egalitarianism any day, racist warts and all.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, while most Americans genuinely endorse equality in principle, they seem unable to embrace the political means necessary to achieve it. Jennifer Hochschild, a political scientist, thinks that Americans are highly egalitarian in the domains of home, school and community, but that they reject egalitarianism in the workplace. They are uncomfortable using politics to redistribute wealth because they feel it mixes up domains.</p>
        <p>I doubt it. Working people do not use politics to repair income inequality because they believe that the democratic process has been corrupted and that politicians are beholden to vested interests. Working- and middle-class Americans certainly desire more money. But having long given up on politicians to do anything about inequality, they have by necessity developed attitudes toward money that enable them to live with it.</p>
        <p>Religion is one buttress. In this most religious of industrialized nations, it is religious Americans, among whom African-Americans are disproportionately numbered, who are among the most inclined to deny money's impact or its role as a measure of success.</p>
        <p>But a majority of the less devout among us also disclaim the influence of money. They imagine that anyone can make it if they really want to. Becoming rich is a matter of choice, and if there is any virtue left, it lies in the road not taken. Many still share Emerson's view that ''money often costs too much,'' added to which are recent developments indicating that it buys less and less status.</p>
        <p>One effect of the vast growth of wealth in contemporary America is that the rich are no longer exalted: too many millionaires have socially degraded wealth. This is all the more true in the strange roller-coaster world of the new economy, where millionaires are daily made from market ether and traditional economic value are upended. The rich can no longer claim to earn their status the old-fashioned way. Like lottery winners, it could happen to anyone.</p>
        <p>It may be, too, that people invest money with different symbolic meanings. Viviana Zelizer, a sociologist, has argued that money has cultural significance beyond its wholly instrumental uses. People earmark and valorize money differently, depending on how it is acquired. The same person who scrupulously saves a portion of her income for the down payment on a home will blow $1,000 won from the lottery on a fancy dress or a party. In this cultural recoinage, money ceases to be fungible. There is earned money and welfare money; clean, laundered and dirty money; breadwinner's money and pin money. And, one surmises, there is the funny money of the rich and the real, honest money of working people.</p>
        <p>In fact, I would contend that the willingness of many Americans to accept the widening income gap, despite their moral reservations about it, grows out of a deep and abiding national conviction: whatever differences fortune may have dictated between people, where it really matters all of us are of truly equal worth.</p>
