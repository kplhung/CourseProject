        <p>They sit at the end of the rutted dirt road, with fenced-in backyards that go too close to the marshes: six house trailers, all showing their age, all occupied, all scheduled for the wrecker's ball in a town that more and more prizes wetlands and open space.</p>
        <p>''People don't want to move, but where can we go?'' said Andreas Garcia, 49, a groundskeeper who owns one of the condemned trailers in the Three Mile Island Trailer Park on Soak Hides Road, about five minutes from the expensive cashmere and leather goods shops on Main Street. ''Now it's too hard to find a place to live.''</p>
        <p>The angry owner-occupants represent merely the most visible evidence of what is happening in the Hamptons, and in the country's wealthiest enclaves and resort towns: many of those who were born here, along with others who arrived more recently, are being forced out.</p>
        <p>The Hamptons has always been a place of contrasts: of workers and wealth, of masons and millionaires, of, recently, carpenters and kings of dot-com. But within the last year the gap has grown. ''It's a disaster,'' said Nina Stewart, who directs the department of housing and community development here.</p>
        <p>In East Hampton, where the average house price is $573,725 -- more than triple the national average -- even salaries as high as $110,000 no longer guarantee a two-bedroom, two-bath bungalow with Montauk daisies and a picket fence. Those with incomes in the $50,000-to-$70,000 range find they are competing for year-round rentals with Manhattanites willing to pay anywhere from $25,000 on up -- just for July and August. And for those earning less than $50,000, a job in the Hamptons increasingly means a long trip home.</p>
        <p>Ms. Stewart has settled in Bellport, unable to find affordable housing in East Hampton. She has joined what locals call the ''trade parade'' along the Montauk Highway, the major road into the Hamptons, which snakes its way through quaint towns every morning starting at 6:30 and every afternoon starting as early as 3. Pickup trucks and vans back up for miles between Bridgehampton and Water Mill, moving as slowly as corn syrup on a frosty morning. Ms. Stewart spends an hour and a half in traffic, twice a day.</p>
        <p>Taking care of those roads has become a challenge. Just weeks before the Memorial Day beach migration, nearly half the jobs on East Hampton's 36-member road crew were unfilled. Workers cannot afford to take jobs paying, on average, $25,000, said Jay H. Schneiderman, the town supervisor, because the cost of housing is so high.</p>
        <p>Many of the people clogging the Montauk Highway are construction workers, the backbone of a building frenzy that has created Suffolk County's lowest unemployment rate, 3 percent, since the state started keeping track in 1974. These skilled laborers, earning $25 to $35 an hour, up from $20 last year, say they, too, cannot find affordable rentals.</p>
        <p>Along Further Lane, Georgica Road and Lily Pond Lane, where Martha Stewart lives a bouillon cube's throw from Steven Spielberg and Harry Macklowe, nothing much is left to rent. Shingled stately homes and Palm Beach-style palazzi are rising from the sandy soil; scaffolding crisscrosses plywood boxes at breakneck speed.</p>
        <p>''We're building an average of a house a day out here,'' Mr. Schneiderman said. ''but none of them will house the people who are going to service these new houses: first, the carpenters, then the lawn guys, the house cleaners, the whole infrastructure to maintain the estates.''</p>
        <p>In this atmosphere, Jan Furman, East Hampton's superintendent of schools, worries about finding candidates who can afford to take the job of high school principal, which pays $110,000. ''It sounds like a lot,'' Dr. Furman said, ''but they can buy a lot less house here than they could in upstate New York, making less.''</p>
        <p>Eric N. Brown, Mr. Schneiderman's chief of staff, just had his $600-a-month rental snatched out from under him by summer tenants.</p>
        <p>''We just moved into the second-floor bedroom of my in-laws,'' said Mr. Brown, a lawyer. His wife, Laura, is a behavioral psychologist. ''We make $75,000 between us, which anywhere else would be a lot,'' he said. ''We looked at a house, a cute little house in Sag Harbor, that overlooked a rubbish dump. It was $399,000; there was no way we could have afforded it, even if we liked it.''</p>
        <p>Many of those who keep the town functioning are moving farther and farther away. They land in towns like Riverhead and Hampton Bays, Shirley and Mastic, trying to keep their jobs along the Hamptons Gold Coast.</p>
        <p>In the inevitable real estate ripple, those at the bottom face the toughest housing problems. In the past, hotels and restaurants sometimes housed seasonal workers -- many from places like Ecuador and Ireland -- in nearby barracks, but even these are being converted to cooperative apartments and sold to weekenders.</p>
        <p>As head of housing in East Hampton, Nina Stewart hands out federal Section 8 subsidies to landlords who offer low- to moderate-income rentals. But the pool of interested landlords is dwindling. The town itself has built about 300 units of subsidized low- to moderate-income housing since 1984, but only five in the last two years, blaming a shortage of available land.</p>
        <p>Mr. Schneiderman said there were now ''only two small parcels in the whole town where we could build affordable housing -- politically. They're both near the railroad tracks.'' But even that proposition, he confessed, would likely encounter political opposition from neighbors.</p>
        <p>More than 100 families who have applied for federally subsidized housing cannot move up on the list.</p>
        <p>Land preservation is the clear winner. Two years ago, county voters levied a 2 percent tax on real-estate transfers, but the money can be used only for open space. With rising property prices, the tax has brought in a windfall, twice as much as was projected only two years ago, and in 1999 alone raised $6 million for East Hampton. More than 500 acres have been set aside for open-space preservation just since January.</p>
        <p>''I think we're doing well on preservation,'' Mr. Schneiderman said, ''and we're doing miserably building houses for our working people.''</p>
        <p>At the Three Mile Island Trailer Park, which the town bought in March, residents meet in angry klatches on the bumpy road near a handwritten ''Eggs for Sale'' sign. They worry that they will not be able to save the six condemned trailers closest to the tall marsh grasses -- trailers that both sides say are probably too old to move. In an interview, Mr. Schneiderman said he would not evict the residents until he could find them a new place to live.</p>
        <p>''Six doesn't sound like much,'' said Richard Whalen, the town lawyer who handles land acquisitions. ''But it's six more units of affordable housing we need.''</p>
        <p>The town has offered $12,000 to $13,000 to buy the trailers, amounts their owners have deemed ridiculous. But even if the town increases the amount -- officials acknowledge privately they would have to raise it substantially to be fair -- the owners say they want to stay.</p>
        <p>''We own our own homes,'' said Mr. Garcia, the groundskeeper, who lives in a condemned trailer. ''Even if we wanted to rent, we couldn't find anything under $2,200 a month.''</p>
        <p>Within the last year, fewer and fewer landlords have been willing to rent out their houses year round, said Diane Saatchi, president of Dayton Halstead Real Estate here, who ''disappoints people looking for year-round rentals on a daily basis.''</p>
        <p>It all boils down to money.</p>
        <p>Cook Pony Farm, a large Hamptons real estate company, found that between December 1998 and December 1999, the average sales price in the combined Hamptons was $464,000; in East Hampton Village, the average price rose to $1.16 million, a 43 percent increase from the year before.</p>
        <p>Consequently, some of those who thought they would live in East Hampton for the rest of their lives now find they cannot.</p>
        <p>''We couldn't find a house there,'' said Lee DeGraaf, a marina worker. Like many other year-round residents, he and his wife have spent their married life moving from one rental to another.</p>
        <p>''When my daughter was born, back in '88, we were paying $700 a month for a real nice house,'' he said. ''But we kept being forced out: the landlords were going to sell the house or were just getting more rent every time.''</p>
        <p>After a lengthy search, the DeGraafs thought they had found something: a $1,400-a-month place on a dirt road. But there was an attic fire the night they moved in. They looked in vain for another rental they could afford in East Hampton. They were forced to widen their search.</p>
        <p>Now, the family feels it has ''lucked out,'' Mr. DeGraaf said, with a three-bedroom house about a 45-minute drive away in Flanders, just south of Riverhead; the rent is $900 a month. Mr. DeGraaf quit his Hamptons painting jobs and found work as a dockmaster at a marina in Hampton Bays. His wife commutes to her old job in an East Hampton pharmacy. ''This house would go for $2,000 a month in East Hampton,'' Mr. DeGraaf said.</p>
        <p>But a year later, the market value of such houses has climbed to $1,200 a month. ''People are being priced out of Riverhead as well,'' said Edwin Fishel Tuccio, who owns a real estate agency in Riverhead. ''Where are they going?'' he said. ''Further west, I guess, into Brookhaven.''</p>
        <p>Others interviewed said a significant number of working-class and middle-class families had left for the southern states or northern New England, where the wages are low, but so are the housing costs.</p>
        <p>Judith Cooper took over as director of land protection for the Nature Conservancy in East Hampton about a year and a half ago, moving there with her husband, Richard, a landscaper, and their infant daughter.</p>
        <p>Last month, they moved again -- to Maine.</p>
        <p>''We had found a place in Amagansett for $1,500 a month,'' she said of her winter rental. When the summer rolled around, Mr. Cooper landed a housesitting job in Southampton, ''but we were merely surviving,'' said Mrs. Cooper, who was earning nearly $50,000.</p>
        <p>Now, she has a lower-paying job as a planner with the state of Maine and the family lives in a three-bedroom cottage on a lake near Augusta.</p>
        <p>''We pay $600 a month rent,'' she said. ''In the Hamptons, we ate warehouse food. We could never go out to eat. Now we can afford a $12, $15, $18 bottle of wine at home. And now we can go out to dinner!</p>
        <p>''It was very difficult to make the decision to leave,'' Mrs. Cooper explained. ''We still have some wonderful friends there, friends who got their piece of the pie 20 years ago. They have a great life.</p>
        <p>''But for us, it just wasn't possible.''</p>
