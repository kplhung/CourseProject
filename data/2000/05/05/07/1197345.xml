        <p>WITH the turn of the millennium, American Ballet Theater moved into overdrive on its new production of ''Swan Lake.'' Mounting a classic as big as this one, with a price tag to match, involved every resource the company could muster. Work days turned into nights for Kevin McKenzie, Ballet Theater's artistic director and ballet master, the dancers and coaching staff and the technical crews, not to mention the efforts of the development office, which raised $1.4 million to assure the splendor of the spectacle.</p>
        <p>The production will have its New York premiere at the Metropolitan Opera House on May 19. ''Swan Lake'' is expected to be the blockbuster of the company's 60th-anniversary season, which opens with a gala performance tomorrow night and runs through July 1.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKenzie describes ''Swan Lake'' as the quintessential ballet, the one that defines the standards of the company, tests its dancers and ennobles the spirit of the viewer. ''It rings so true of human nature, of man's inconsistency, of the victimizing of women, so full of big truths,'' he says. ''The key point is about not being able to marry one's ideals to one's realities.''</p>
        <p>These issues came to life on stage in St. Petersburg in 1895 when Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov created the choreography for the ''Swan Lake'' that has come down to us, joined to Tchaikovsky's glorious score (the first, butchered staging of the score was in 1877). Mr. McKenzie has based his production on theirs, but combined his own ideas with the familiar story about the Prince who falls in love with a Swan Queen in the power of the wicked sorcerer von Rothbart.</p>
        <p>Late one March afternoon, Mr. McKenzie stood watching a rehearsal of the prologue he has added to ''Swan Lake'' while two two-man teams double cast as von Rothbart refined a fancy twisting of the body around an arm. In rethinking the scenario, Mr. McKenzie needed to introduce up front his notion of presenting the evil sorcerer as a split personality, with two dancers trading places as the character throughout the ballet. It was not hard to picture the moment of theatrical magic he intends with von Rothbart's transformation from devil to suave courtier. Off in a corner, three of the principal dancers cast as the Swan Queen at different performances -- Paloma Herrera, Julie Kent and Susan Jaffe -- waited for the cue to walk unknowingly into von Rothbart's trap.</p>
        <p>A prologue that explains the Swan Queen's enchantment in a long-ago and faraway era before the familiar story unfolds is another of the innovations Mr. McKenzie has brought to this ''Swan Lake.'' Still another is condensing the ballet into two acts, posing a challenge for the set and costume designer, Zack Brown.</p>
        <p>''Swan Lake'' takes place in four distinct locales, requiring the shifting of backdrops and platforms from the palace garden, to the lakeside, to the palace ballroom and back to a different perspective of the lake. Mr. Brown solved the problem of only one intermission by using a traveling curtain, with silhouetted trees, to bring in the lakeside clearing, plus a transparent back wall for the palace and a ballroom platform that breaks in half for the final act. Before the ballet's premiere at the Kennedy Center in Washington last month, Ballet Theater's technical crew spent a week in one of the theaters on the campus of the State University of New York in Purchase to devise the intricate backstage choreography for the rapid set changes.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Barbara Matera's costume shop on the fifth floor above the company's studios at 890 Broadway was buzzing with 85 workers constructing the more than 300 costumes required for the multiple casting of roles. In one corner, three women did nothing but hand beading and embroidery. Another worker bent over the colored ribbon she was threading into fabric for the vests to be worn by the Neapolitan dancers for about three minutes of stage time. Forty-four swan tutus had to be hand pleated of tulle to look like feathers.</p>
        <p>Bruce Horowitz, Ballet Theater's wardrobe supervisor for the last 19 years, planned a strategy as complicated as a military maneuver for the quick costume changes. The women of the corps de ballet will have only a few minutes to shed their Act I peasant costumes for tutus. During Act III, the corps members, dressed in court costumes, must melt off the stage a few at a time to climb back into tutus and point shoes. Mr. Horowitz had already measured the dancers' feet for 140 pairs of leather boots that complement the court and peasant costumes and sent the men's measurements to Portland, Ore., and the women's to Russia, where the boots were made.</p>
        <p>Most people who have seen a production of ''Swan Lake'' -- its viewers since 1895 must number in the millions because the work is a staple of repertories the world over -- retain, above all else, the image of the Swan Queen, with her quivering arms, long, arched neck and demeanor of doom. Behind her, sister swan maidens dance in perfect symmetry to complete the moonlit vision that has remained in collective memory.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKenzie can be forgiven for having a viewpoint that differs from the shared opinion that the ballet belongs to the Swan Queen. The fate of Prince Siegfried has been his to ponder since 1980, when he made his debut in the role, a year after he joined Ballet Theater as a dancer. He believes the focus of the ballet is the Prince. ''In my mind, the Swan's story is done,'' Mr. McKenzie says, ending a 12-hour day at the studio by talking about his work on the ballet. ''The story happens to Siegfried, not the Swan. He can't marry his ideal to reality. That is the tragedy.''</p>
        <p>In radically shortening Act IV, Mr. McKenzie brings the story to a quick conclusion. ''Prince Siegfried's rite of passage is that he realizes he owes it to her to join her in death,'' he says. ''Her rite of passage is that she realizes she can forgive him for his betrayal.''</p>
        <p>A full-length production of ''Swan Lake,'' choreographed after Petipa and Ivanov by David Blair of the Royal Ballet, has been in the A.B.T. repertory since 1967, briefly replaced by Mikhail Baryshnikov's production in 1988. However, Mr. Baryshnikov took the rights to his ballet with him when he left the company in 1989. Ballet Theater reverted to Blair's ballet in 1993 when Mr. McKenzie first staged ''Swan Lake.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McKenzie was a teenage ballet student in Washington when he saw excerpts from ''Swan Lake'' on a Bolshoi Ballet program. A year later he attended a Ballet Theater performance and saw his first full-length ''Swan Lake.'' In subsequent years, the company became an annual visitor to Washington at the Kennedy Center. Mr. McKenzie went regularly to the performances. ''I grew up seeing all those wonderful casts,'' he says. ''I was obviously very thrilled when my time came to do the ballet.''</p>
        <p>''Swan Lake'' has been a constant in the company's history since 1940, when the Act II lakeside scene was presented in its opening season. Lucia Chase, a founder of Ballet Theater, its director with Oliver Smith from 1945 to 1980 and its financial fairy godmother, had dreamed of a full-length ''Swan Lake'' to replace the one-act version. But there wasn't enough money or dancers until 1967, when an enlarged company presented Blair's complete version. With its premiere, the first of the evening-length classics that A.B.T. would produce, ''Ballet Theatre acquired the confident assurance that it could rank itself among the half-dozen major ballet companies of the world,'' according to Charles Payne in his detailed history, ''American Ballet Theatre,'' published by Knopf in 1977.</p>
        <p>Mr. McKenzie has inherited Chase's opinion that ''Swan Lake'' is a necessity for Ballet Theater: ''It's obvious,'' he says. ''Every big company needs a 'Swan Lake.' To be crass about it, if you don't speak in artistic terms, it's one of the very few ballets that sells at the box office. I view A.B.T. as one of the five major companies in the world and as the national company of the United States. I think every national company should have its representations of the classics.''</p>
        <p>By 1997, Mr. McKenzie had determined that the decades-old scenery by Oliver Smith and costumes by Freddy Wittop for the Blair ''Swan Lake'' had to be replaced, and decided to mount his own production. During the period of preparation for his ballet, a flock of other dancing swans swarmed in: the Broadway import from London by Matthew Bourne, the 1999 New York City Ballet staging by Peter Martins and James Kudelka's version for the National Ballet of Canada. Mr. McKenzie attended performances of them all, but says: ''Oh, there are no new ideas left, so I'll just put my emotional stamp on 'Swan Lake.' Hopefully we'll have this production for the next 30 years.''</p>
