        <p>THE fox hunters were out, jodhpurs freshly cleaned, boots  polished, riding their plump mounts across the winter-brown fields silvery with frost. I was on foot, rounding the last leg of the loop I run whenever I visit this southeastern Pennsylvania countryside I grew up in.</p>

        <p>THE fox hunters were out, jodhpurs freshly cleaned, boots  polished, riding their plump mounts across the winter-brown fields silvery with frost. I was on foot, rounding the last leg of the loop I run whenever I visit this southeastern Pennsylvania countryside I grew up in.</p>
        <p>In this horse-dotted landscape, equestrian events like steeplechases and the hunt have a devoted, eccentric following. People drive around staking out spots where they might catch a glimpse of riders and hounds coursing over the hills. They'll spend the morning sitting in a car and be gratified by a sight that might last all of a minute and a half.</p>
        <p>As I approached the turnoff to my parents' house, I slowed, leery of a parked pickup truck and a couple of grizzled guys smoking cigarettes and stamping their feet in the cold. ''Can I help you?'' I asked, drawing myself up and summoning up as much property owner's authority as I could, on my parents' behalf.</p>
        <p>''We're fox huntin', missy,'' said the one in the heavy, faded plaid shirt, making his claim to the land. ''You know anything about fox huntin'?''</p>
        <p>I didn't stop to explain my own claim, that I'd lived up the road from the kennel where the hounds sometimes howled all night, that I'd seen foals born and horses die, that I'd known some of the riders since they were kids, that I'd ridden a yellow school bus to this very spot countless times 35 or so years ago.</p>
        <p>I realized that he took me for one of the multiplying arrivistes who now whiz around the country roads on fancy bicycles or in high-tech running shoes and neon microfiber outfits. He resented me.</p>
        <p>I understood. Although I had moved away, choosing an urban life over a rural one, I expected that that rural life would be there when I needed it.</p>
        <p>But nearby cities have thrived and spread. Farmers whose children, like me, have made lives elsewhere are selling their one asset -- their land -- when they can no longer keep it up themselves.</p>
        <p>First the area became a playground. One orchard opened a general store, offered pick-your-own pumpkins and strawberries and sheep-petting photo ops. Put a quarter in a machine, get a handful of nuggets and the sheep will lick your fingers. A freight-bearing train reinvented itself as scenic railroad, taking its passengers through leafy green glens in summer and blazing maple and oak in fall. It ran along part of the narrow, winding Brandywine River, upon which parties of canoeists float when the water is high enough. A local triathlon -- of partners who walk, bike and canoe -- that started years ago as a quirky low-key fall event snowballed into a competition for which people train, seriously scouting the terrain ahead of the date, puffing up hills and quaking when farm watchdogs bark. An old, rickety cow barn, freshly painted, is the site of a summer folk festival.</p>
        <p>My father used to drive our family to Lancaster, Pa., for the day, when he needed to shop for a piece of tack or get a saddle repaired. We'd marvel at the ways of the Amish, and at the same time be glad we were there with a purpose, not just to gawk. The fishbowl aspect of their lives even then was in part calculated, but despite the boon of tourism, I thought of the intrusion they must feel.</p>
        <p>The place where I've got the deepest roots is now similarly becoming a destination. Richly historic, it's drawing ever more people these days. Tasteful but prominent brown signs have been put up to point the way to the major attractions like Winterthur, Longwood Gardens, the Brandywine Battlefield.</p>
        <p>But what draws the Sunday drivers and other visitors to the landscape that Andrew Wyeth made so familiar is in danger of vanishing. Those who used to come for a day in the country now want a piece of it for themselves. Outsized houses are sprouting like weeds on any available hilltop, loudly architectural. The centuries-old houses and barns of gorgeously worn stone and red-painted wood seem embarrassed by their new, unsightly neighbors. The open fields are shrinking.</p>
        <p>I comfort myself sometimes by thinking of the secrets the newcomers and tourists won't ever know about this land: Where the May apples and jack-in-the-pulpits grow in the many microclimates of the woods. How to spot the fox that doesn't get caught, streaking up the hillside after the horses and hounds have thundered past. Summer afternoons spent poking along with friends by those railroad tracks or hunting for bullfrogs in the creeks. Life here can also be rugged; more than once tornadoes have ripped the tin roofs from sheds, sent huge trees crashing through houses. Deer menace the roads, ravage the gardens. Lyme disease is a plague. A rainstorm can ruin a field of cut hay.</p>
        <p>Once my husband and I played tourist for a weekend. We went out to dinner and to a museum and tried out one of the proliferating bed-and-breakfasts. A refugee from New York had bought and painstakingly restored an old stone farmhouse, furnishing it with locally scavenged antiques. He also ran a furniture store across the road, and the pieces in the rooms were for sale, too: discreet price tags dangled on the sides of the beds and dressers. When we went down into the big, open living area for breakfast, I realized why I'd been feeling so strange: the house smelled just like one I'd spent dozens of nights in, on sleepovers at my childhood friend Jennifer's farm: damp, a bit like dogs, comfortingly warm and old. People -- we -- were paying for the experience of sleeping for a night in my own past.</p>
        <p>Last summer I went to a little town on Lake Michigan, where 15 of us settled in for a week's celebration of my parents-in-law's 50 years of marriage. I set out one day on a bicycle, and soon found myself in rolling farmland, where the hills were gentle and fields of crops ripening in the July sun stretched on both sides of the road.</p>
        <p>In the distance I saw an orchard. It looked incongruously space-age, with each young tree festooned in strips of silver Mylar glittering in the breeze. Three men were working just off the main road, and, ready to give my legs a rest, I stopped to ask them about the silvery stuff. A man about my age told me it was to ward off the deer. ''We've tried everything,'' he said. ''This seems to scare them off a little, especially if there's a moon out.'' He proudly reeled off the kinds of apples they were planting, more varieties than I had ever heard of.</p>
        <p>One of the other two men, looking gentlemanly with snow-white hair and brand-new denim overalls, was his father. The land had been in the family for generations. Deer were a minor threat in the grand scheme of the farm. ''We deal with all kinds of varmints,'' they told me. ''Groundhogs, bugs -- if it's not one it's another. Or the weather can damage a whole year's crop.'' The younger man, in a mood to talk, was hoping he'd be able to pass the farm on to his own three sons, but was struggling to be able to do so. The ranks of migrant pickers, he said, were dwindling, as the workers now more often chose jobs in fast-food restaurants than in the fields. Selling produce wholesale yielded little income. So he was planting pick-your-own crops, and his wife was selling pies at a stand down the road in an effort to hold out against what he called ''going into the real estate business,'' cashing in on the land and abandoning his family's tradition. ''My sons might sell it, but I want to give them that choice,'' he said.</p>
        <p>I didn't want to keep them from their work, so I wheeled the bike back onto the hardtop and got ready to pedal away. ''You take care on that bike,'' said the older man, with a wave and a smile.</p>
        <p>I would have stopped for a pie -- I love pie -- but I didn't think I could manage it on my bike. Months later, I still worry about that farm, and how, besides the vagaries of weather and varmints, its owners will now have to factor in the whims of day-trippers like me.</p>
