        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re the April 30 article ''Massive, Powerful and a Woman at the Wheel:''</p>
        <p>I spend a lot of time driving around Westchester, and I can honestly say that most people who drive these vehicles -- male and female -- don't know how to handle them.</p>
        <p>With practice, most drivers will eventually become accustomed to the physical and spatial differences between S.U.V.'s and smaller, more manageable vehicles; however, the biggest problem these vehicles pose to other cars is the psychological and egotistical impact S.U.V.'s have on the attitudes of their owners.</p>
        <p>In the article, Janette Barnes speaks about getting respect on the road, and not having others flashing their lights at her when she makes a minor mistake while driving.</p>
        <p>Perhaps there's a reasonable connection between Ms. Barnes's driving habits and those who flash their lights at her. So-called minor mistakes can cause major accidents. Better attention to the rules of the road will cut down on both minor mistakes and those annoyin lights.</p>
        <p>However, driving a bigger vehicle for psychological reasons will not make anyone a safer driver.</p>
        <p>Some have suggested that S.U.V.'s be classifed as trucks, which require higher standards for operating.</p>
        <p>Of course, I don't expect that to happen because lobbyists for the auto industry won't allow it, and policymakers usually don't do things that make sense either.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, the safety of a lot of people on the road is left to the judgment of people who talk on the phone while driving, who frequently change lanes without signalling and who think that intimidating other drivers with their imposing vehicles is soothing to their own fragile egos.</p>
        <p>My question to these ladies: is this your mindset before or after you pick your kids up from school?</p>
