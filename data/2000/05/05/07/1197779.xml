        <p>Robert Halmi Sr., the Cecil B. DeMille of the 27-inch screen, speaks proudly of the inspirational power of that pulpy television standby, the mini-series.</p>
        <p>''Sadly, compared to European classical education, American education is rather shallow when it comes to literature,'' he was saying the other day. ''And the wonder is that when we do a movie of a book, the reprinted classic can become an incredible best seller.

        <p>Robert Halmi Sr., the Cecil B. DeMille of the 27-inch screen, speaks proudly of the inspirational power of that pulpy television standby, the mini-series.</p>
        <p>''Sadly, compared to European classical education, American education is rather shallow when it comes to literature,'' he was saying the other day. ''And the wonder is that when we do a movie of a book, the reprinted classic can become an incredible best seller. Simon &amp; Schuster told me that after my movie of 'Gulliver's Travels' came out, they sold more copies of the book than they did in the 10 years before.''</p>
        <p>No one would actually argue that the made-for-television movie genre was the natural domain of great literature, would they? Well, no one, perhaps, except Mr. Halmi, who is so fond of turning dusty tomes into glamorous video entertainments that it would not be surprising if he one day simply pulled several armsful of books off the shelves and produced ''World Lit: The Mini-Series.''</p>
        <p>''Who has really read Cervantes's 'Don Quixote'?'' Mr. Halmi asked during a recent telephone interview from Singapore, where he is shooting -- what else? -- a mini-series. ''If anybody says they read it, they're lying. But after our movie, I bet you a lot of people said they did.''</p>
        <p>With his son, Robert Halmi Jr., the Hungarian-born Mr. Halmi Sr., of course, did produce a television version of ''Don Quixote.'' And one of ''Alice in Wonderland'' and ''Arabian Nights'' and ''Moby-Dick'' and ''The Odyssey'' and ''Animal Farm'' and on and on. The Halmis have, in fact, made an entire industry of transforming the classics into small-screen spectacles, which they bring to the airwaves with almost indecent frequency. Over the last few months alone, their productions of ''Don Quixote'' with John Lithgow, ''A Christmas Carol'' with Patrick Stewart, ''Arabian Nights'' and the ambitious, original fantasia ''The 10th Kingdom'' have been broadcast. That is an output unmatched, to say the least, by any other creator of television mini-series.</p>
        <p>Tonight at 9 on NBC, the Halmis' inexhaustible library is open for business yet again, with the first installment of their latest costume drama, ''Jason and the Argonauts,'' a four-hour adaptation of the harrowing story out of Greek mythology of the fearless young mariner who does battle with women warriors, Acropolis-size sea swells and wrathful gods, all in his quest for the Ultimate Woolly, the golden fleece.</p>
        <p>The two-part series -- directed by Nick Willing and featuring Dennis Hopper as an evil Greek despot, Sir Derek Jacobi as a blind oracle, Frank Langella as another evil Greek despot and Jason London as the seafaring hero -- may be derived from ancient texts, but its signature is unmistakably Halmi. All the producers' trademark touches are in evidence: the big name-brand stars, the lavish visual effects, the epic narrative of the sort that formed the basis for much of the Hollywood career of Charlton Heston.</p>
        <p>Big, lavish, epic. The words do sound more applicable to a bygone era of filmmaking, and certainly alien to the generally more limited dimensions of television. The senior Mr. Halmi, though, does not like to think in terms of limits. His productions, many of which, like ''Jason,'' cost in the $20 million to $30 million range, have more in common with old-time disaster flicks than mainstream television drama: they are shot on location, cast internationally, marketed worldwide. (It is overseas, in fact, where many of his projects earn back their investments.)</p>
        <p>''Obviously, I would like to do something different than anybody else,'' said Mr. Halmi, who is chairman of Hallmark Entertainment, a division of the greeting-card company that also produces feature films and Broadway shows. ''I don't want to be in a category. But that is not the sole motivation. The motivation is to do something that has self-value, that has educational value and at the same time, entertains.''</p>
        <p>The Halmis' idea of how to entertain? Volume, volume, volume. Essentially, say those who know them, the Halmis operate in distinct spheres: the father is the ideas man and his press-shy namesake, known as Robi, is in charge of the financial end of the business, in his capacity as president and chief executive of Hallmark Entertainment. It was the younger Mr. Halmi, for instance, who negotiated the 1994 purchase of their company by Hallmark Cards, associates say.</p>
        <p>The elder Mr. Halmi worked as a photographer for Life magazine in the 1950's, later gravitating to documentaries and then television movies. He hit it big in television in 1989 with ''Lonesome Dove,'' a sprawling, critically lauded mini-series based on Larry McMurtry's novel; it won a bunch of Emmys and even a Peabody. But the more significant breakthrough may have come in 1996, with the Halmis' version of ''Gulliver's Travels,'' a ratings success as surprising as the discovery of an old treasure on ''Antiques Roadshow.''</p>
        <p>''Gulliver's'' made plain to network executives the drawing power of literary classics; today, Mr. Halmi Sr. says, he and his son produce between 50 and 60 hours of television a year. ''He is worrying about the money, and I am worrying about spending it,'' the father said. In any given year, quality can vary wildly. Last year, for instance, a Halmi high point was a well-received version of the musical ''Annie''; months earlier, the Halmis rolled out a small-screen dramatization of ''Noah's Ark.'' Noting the cheesy special effects, a reviewer for The New York Times called it ''highly peculiar.'' (It was also the second-highest-rated show on television that week.)</p>
        <p>Advances in technology have greatly aided the Halmis' effort to bring fantastical books to the small screen -- morphing is a favorite tool -- but Mr. Halmi Sr. argues that what makes for great television is a ripping yarn. And most of the best yarns, he says, were written through the ages by people with cinematic imaginations. Even when the cinema didn't exist.</p>
        <p>''There are great, great books that are fantasy-based that could never be translated to television; somehow the technology was not ready,'' he said. Now he believes anything can done. ''There are books that no one has attempted to do, and it's great stuff,'' he says. ''Unfortunately, people just don't go to the well; they try to dream up reality-based stories. That's depressing. You have to be a little original, and Hollywood is not known for that.''</p>
        <p>At the moment, Mr. Halmi Sr. is supervising production of a new mini-series, ''The Monkey King,'' and filling his head with the video future. ''I'm reading, for the 10th time, Rudyard Kipling's 'Jungle Book,' '' he said, ''because I want to do something that's never been done before, a live-action 'Jungle Book.' It's tough to find speaking tigers and bears.''</p>
        <p>Also on his mind: Dante. He is actually considering ''The Divine Comedy.'' For commercial television. And he does not want to take a lot of meetings about it. ''I'm getting to be in a hurry,'' he added, ''because I'm 76.''</p>
