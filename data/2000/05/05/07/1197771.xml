        <p>In the first year of a program rewarding New Jersey's 31 public universities, colleges and community colleges for good performance, schools were awarded $8 million in grants for good performance, or 92 percent of the amount of money available. The grants are based on universities' and colleges' performance in such areas as graduation rates, numbers of transfers, the diversity of funding sources and efficiency (cooperation with other institutions and having optimum enrollment in classes). Rutgers University (awarded $2.8 million) and the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey ($1.7 million) got the highest ratings.</p>
