        <p>SHADOW BABY</p>
        <p>By Alison McGhee.</p>
        <p>243 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>Harmony Books. $23.</p>
        <p>THOUGH not yet 12 years old, the precocious heroine of Alison McGhee's second novel exhibits all the symptoms of a future fiction writer -- including a jump-start on that unhappy childhood said to be essential for anyone worth her Underwood. A preadolescent of hazy provenance, Clara Winter is preoccupied by the dim places beneath the canopy of her family tree. Her mother, Tamar, will not speak of Clara's father -- or her grandfather. Tamar also refuses to reveal anything about Clara's twin sister, who died at birth in the cab of a pickup truck that spun into a ditch in the midst of a blizzard. No wonder Clara insists on writing her last name with a lowercase ''w,'' as ''a rejection of winter, an acknowledgment of what winter really is and how it can kill.''</p>
        <p>Were she a daughter of privilege downstate, this anxious little girl might wind up on a psychologist's couch -- end of story. But this is the backwoods of upstate New York, and Clara is left on her own to tease out the answers to her questions. While the single-mindedness of her pursuit can make the plot of ''Shadow Baby'' feel claustrophobic -- and McGhee's symbolic freighting of that search could benefit from a lighter touch -- the novel still manages to be a suspenseful and moving account of Clara's coming of age.</p>
        <p>Portraying a Mensa-grade child as anything but a cartoon is a tricky proposition, yet McGhee has made Clara a credible if exasperating heroine. She quotes Shakespeare. She uses words like ''suttee'' in conversation, and she has a long list of other favorites: ''Veritable belongs to me. It's one of my words. I like the way all the syllables after the 'ver' go mumbling into each other.''</p>
        <p>Old soul though she may appear, Clara turns out to be a babe in the Adirondack woods when it comes to understanding life -- or, to be more precise, when it comes to understanding that life seldom lends itself to easy comprehension. People make choices. Chance intervenes. The two congeal into a personal history that can't always be explained but must often simply be accepted.</p>
        <p>Clara, however, is a girl who badly wants a happy ending. When her badgering of Tamar yields few clues about her family, she turns to her lavish imagination. She fills in the blanks surrounding the death of her twin (the ''shadow baby'' of the title) with fanciful details. She writes fake book reports about brave pioneer children who, like her, have an unclear past and an uncertain future. Clara even conjures up a heroic childhood for her surrogate grandpa, a laconic old metalsmith who lives nearby. These fictions serve both as a blanket to warm her and as a shield against a truth that, when revealed, will not prove so neat or satisfying.</p>
        <p>Much of this novel recalls ''Rainlight,'' the author's 1998 debut, also set in the same region. In McGhee's fiction, this is a place where children and adults reach out almost obsessively for those who are gone but hardly forgotten, a place where people grieve over lost opportunities, their thoughts lingering on what might have been. Her characters marvel at the cruel interjection of chance that has rearranged their lot in life, and all the while the same few memories play torturously on a permanent loop in their minds -- a stylistic tactic that can grow as wearying to the reader as it can to the characters themselves.</p>
        <p>The craft of metalworking is the abiding and none-too-subtle metaphor for redemption in ''Shadow Baby,'' as the old man shows Clara how castoff tin cans, bent by force and fire, may be transformed into delicate lanterns that brighten the Adirondack woods. He teaches her ''to train my eyes to see the possibility of beauty'' around her. The analogy is plain. In fact, McGhee zealously hammers it home from epigraph to final page: Life's uninvited hardships may warp us, but they can also make us stronger. And our new selves, however changed, are still able to cast a clear light. By the novel's end, Clara has only begun to digest this message. One suspects that, like McGhee herself, she will make a career of working it through in her writing.</p>
