        <p>T.S. ELIOT'S ''Family Reunion'' has risen greatly in critical esteem since it flopped like unleavened dough in the West End 60-odd years ago. Many now regard the poet's story of the English lord impelled by updated Furies to atone for his wife's dark death as the nearest to a theatrical masterpiece Eliot ever wrote. And even the more skeptical would probably agree that the play is interesting as an experimental attempt to restore verse to British drama, or at least as an indirect insight into its author's own awful marriage.</p>
        <p>New Yorkers will doubtless make up their own minds when the Royal Shakespeare Company's revival of the play opens at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Yet an influential essay published in 1950 shows how close ''The Family Reunion'' came to joining the bric-a-brac of history in the theatrical junkyard. According to this, the play lacks dramatic development. Its overabrupt conclusion comes ''after an interminable amount of preparation.'' The mix of the mythic and modern is awkward. The author tries to update ''The Oresteia,'' suggesting that the House of Monchensey is a British House of Atreus poisoned to its roots by sins both recent and long ago, but fails either to stick closely to Aeschylus or to venture far enough away from him -- and so remains marooned in an artistic no man's land.</p>
        <p>Moreover, an attempt to transform the aunts and uncles in Lord Monchensey's drawing room into a Greek chorus is woefully unsuccessful. The Furies pursuing this troubled aristocrat are a disaster, since in practice they look like uninvited guests from a fancy dress ball or a swarming football team or a Disney cartoon or half-visible shrubbery outside the window. And it's hard for the audience to sympathize with a hero who renounces his mother, his house and his heritage for the spiritual life, when he is plainly an ''insufferable prig.''</p>
        <p>And why should we still listen to this contemptuous and possibly contemptible diatribe? Well, because the critic with the long sword was T. S. Eliot himself. He believed he had learned much about stagecraft from the failure of ''The Family Reunion.'' Others might say he had lost his nerve, had begun to prove it by writing the fascinating but far less ambitious ''Cocktail Party'' and was about to destroy the credibility of a renaissance of poetic drama in Britain with a flimsy comedy called ''The Confidential Clerk.'' Subtler or slyer critics might add that ''The Family Reunion'' was too close to the psychological bone for the self-effacing Eliot's liking.</p>
        <p>Harry Monchensey returns to his ancestral home at least as dejected as Eliot himself was in 1936, when he began to write ''The Family Reunion.'' He has, he believes, been as guilty of wife-murder as Orestes was of matricide. He has killed Lady Monchensey by pushing her off an ocean liner. This naturally shocks his family, who assume he is hallucinating, but the death itself is a relief to all. The poor woman was a bitter if fragile neurotic, jealous of her husband's friends and relations: ''A restless, shivering painted shadow'' who wanted to bring Harry ''down to her own level.''</p>
        <p>In other words, she was very like Vivien Haigh-Wood, the Englishwoman the 27-year-old Eliot dismayed his parents by marrying in 1915. To the virginal young American newly arrived in Britain she seemed glamorous and exciting, but beneath her surface vivacity she was deeply troubled. To read Peter Ackroyd's biography of the poet, ''T. S. Eliot,'' is like reading doctors' notes. Vivien variously suffered from neuralgia, menstrual cramps, fainting fits, malnutrition, ''catarrh of the intestines,'' septic influenza, paralysis, hysteria, manic depression, panic attacks, paranoia and obsessional behavior, meaning she constantly washed her hands. And she made Eliot as unhappy as he clearly made her.</p>
        <p>Tranquilizing drugs, mainly morphine and ether, seem to have harmed rather than helped. Vivien became a possessive wife who enjoyed embarrassing Eliot before his friends and encouraged him to reject many of them. Conrad Aiken had a dinner with the two of them at which, looking like a ''shivering, shuddering'' scarecrow, she traded hate-filled tirades with her husband.</p>
        <p>When Edith Sitwell met her by chance in the street, Vivien responded to her greeting with, ''No, no, you have mistaken me again for that terrible woman who is so like me and is always getting me into trouble.''</p>
        <p>She told Virginia Woolf she kept hornets under her bed and then accused her of having an affair with Eliot. She was rumored to carry a knife in her handbag.</p>
        <p>It couldn't go on indefinitely, and it didn't. Vivien never accepted that Eliot had left her, but he did just that when he took a professorship at Harvard for the year 1932-33, asked his lawyers to send her a Deed of Separation while he was in America and refused to have anything to do with her after his return.</p>
        <p>There is little clear information about her later activities, though it is known that she saw her husband's play ''Murder in the Cathedral'' seven times in 1936 and was committed to a London mental hospital in 1938. When Eliot heard she had died there in 1947, he buried his head in his hands, crying: ''Oh, God! Oh, God!''</p>
        <p>Eliot said that the character in ''The Family Reunion'' most like him was Harry's Uncle Charles, a genial Mayfair man-about-town; but that is surely disingenuous or self-deceiving. There is doubtless substance in the skeptical portrait of the poet, and the more sympathetic one of Vivien, that Michael Hastings painted in his 1984 play and 1994 screenplay ''Tom and Viv.'' What must it have been like to be married to such a man?</p>
        <p>In the 1920's and 30's Eliot was more like the ''insufferable prig'' himself, a remote, intellectually disdainful figure, who was consumed with guilt at the antipathy he felt for his impossible wife and who found a grim consolation for his misery in religion. Eliot did not ''push'' Vivien into any sea, but then neither did Harry, not literally. Harry probably watched as his wife went over the rails, Eliot as she went off them.</p>
        <p>Creative cause and effect are always hard to pin down, but nobody could claim that ''The Family Reunion'' is the work of a contented man. The Furies are eventually revealed as the Eumenides, or kindly ones, as they are in Aeschylus' ''Oresteia.'' But they still require Harry to live a life of ascetic self-sacrifice. Indeed, the play's verse is as bleak as that of ''Burnt Norton,'' which Eliot wrote in 1935 and eventually integrated into his book of poems ''Four Quartets.'' You can feel the dread in phrases like ''the sobbing in the chimney, the evil in the dark closet''; ''the wind's talk in the dry holly-tree''; ''the unspoken voice of sorrow in the ancient bedroom at 3 o'clock in the morning.'' You can also hear the poetry.</p>
        <p>ELIOT was not the only major writer who tried to help the English theater recover its long-lost poetic prowess -- Shelley and Browning had similar hopes -- but with him it became an obsession. Again and again he argued that ''the human soul, in intense emotion, strives to express itself in verse.'' Again and again he debated ways of making colloquial dialogue and contemporary conflict as poetic as they had been in the Jacobean era. As late as 1950 he was declaring that there were emotional and spiritual aspects to life, ''which prose drama was wholly inadequate to express.''</p>
        <p>But if we discount ''The Rock,'' a pageant about the building of a church, Eliot's first serious attempt at verse drama was, by his own admission, a ''dead end.''  ''Murder in the Cathedral'' remains a memorable account of the martyrdom of Thomas a Becket; but it was designed for special performance in Canterbury Cathedral and aimed at those serious people who, as Eliot said, go to festivals and ''expect to have to put up with poetry.'' What he wanted was to bring depth to the drawing rooms where successful West End plays were invariably set and ask audiences to listen to poetry ''from people dressed like ourselves, living in houses and apartments like ours, and using telephones and motor cars and radio sets.''</p>
        <p>With this aim in mind, he endlessly revised ''The Family Reunion.'' According to Michael Redgrave, who played Harry after Eliot rejected John Gielgud as ''not religious enough to understand the character's motivation,'' the author sat uneasily aloof at rehearsals but was always ready to adjust the text. He must, then, have been shaken by the reviews that followed the play's opening in March 1939. Virtually all the London critics found the play literary, slow and abstruse, and they were hardly more sympathetic when it received its first major revival in 1955, even though Peter Brook was the director and Paul Scofield played Harry.</p>
        <p>''The Family Reunion'' fared no better in postwar Manhattan, where it was staged first at the Cherry Lane Theater in 1947, then on Broadway in 1958. Reviewing the second production in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson praised Lillian Gish for endowing the wisest of Harry's aunts with spiritual strength but thought the play ''a wordy drama about uninteresting people engaged in a struggle that they are not eager to explain.'' The irony is that well before this revival Eliot had come to agree with him.</p>
        <p>A bolder dramatist might have reacted to criticism by drawing on his unique strengths and increasing his poetry's intensity. Eliot did the opposite. ''The Cocktail Party,'' which appeared in 1949, also involves a spiritual loner who rejects the humdrum world for the religious life. She is far more sympathetic, humbler and warmer than Harry, perhaps partly because Eliot had himself been thawed by a second, much happier marriage. But the language has lost much of its originality. In his own words, he had put the verse on such ''a very thin diet'' that it was ''an open question whether there is any poetry in the play at all.''</p>
        <p>His last two plays, which appeared in 1953 and 1958, not only confirm that view but justify those who felt that, far from transforming the West End, he had let the West End transform him. He had chosen to tailor three-piece dramas in conventional gray flannel. ''The Confidential Clerk,'' a comedy about a young man with a religious vocation, was dismissed by one critic as ''a repertory of West End gestures,'' and ''The Elder Statesman,'' in which a politician confronts his past sins, was damned by another, with a sneering reference to the father of drawing-room drama. It was, wrote Kenneth Tynan, ''Pinero on stilts.''</p>
        <p>The arrival in London of John Osborne's ''Look Back in Anger'' in 1956 and the kitchen-sink drama that followed did even more damage to Eliot's crusade. Christopher Fry, Ronald Duncan and others who had helped him pioneer a poetic revival in Britain also fell victim to the vogue for social realism. Yet that, in turn, came to seem imaginatively limiting, and in 1979 Michael Elliott staged a production of ''The Family Reunion'' in London that was surprisingly well received. Reviewers who no longer demanded consistency of style or tone seemed exhilarated by the inventiveness of Eliot's language and chilled by Furies transmuted into towering ghosts in white cowls.</p>
        <p>That was, as it happened, also the first time I had seen ''The Family Reunion'' onstage, and I recall wishing to dig Eliot up and give his skeleton a shaking. How could he have been so intimidated by the conventional drama of his day? Yes, Harry is a bit of a prig, but to a critic half-deadened by endless insular plays about the British class system, Eliot's insistence that the man has a soul to discover seemed infinitely refreshing. And, yes, some of the verse was flat, but much of it resonated with that strange wintry music that made him perhaps the greatest of 20th-century poets. It was as if Eliot were telling the dramatists of his day and mine that there were possibilities, spiritual and verbal, they had never even contemplated.</p>
        <p>NEW YORKERS will, as I say, make up their own minds about Adrian Noble's revival at BAM. (It is being accompanied by ''A Midsummer Night's Dream'' and Schiller's ''Don Carlos.'') But most of the British critics now find the play's oddities more than digestible. ''The R.S.C. has struck gold,'' declared John Gross in The Sunday Telegraph, adding that even when ''The Family Reunion'' becomes elusive or off-putting, it is ''curiously compelling -- you succumb to its spell.''</p>
        <p>John Peter in The Sunday Times wrote, ''A tense, gaunt, uncluttered production of Eliot's greatest play.''</p>
        <p>Thirty-five years after his death, Eliot the dramatist-who-might-have-been has gained posthumous recognition. Ours is an era that no longer winces at choruses on the patterned carpet or Furies behind the leather armchair or echoes of the ''Four Quartets'' beside the drinks cupboard. We don't shrink from stylized language, whether it has been written by Aeschylus, Shakespeare, Synge, Beckett or Pinter. In fact, we tend to think that the argument about the need for a poetic drama misses the point by confusing poetry with verse.</p>
        <p>Prose can be poetic, and poetry prosaic. Given the right director and actors, can't ''The Oresteia,''  ''The Family Reunion,''  ''Waiting for Godot,''  ''The Homecoming'' and ''American Buffalo'' achieve the kind of elusive magic that Eliot had in mind? Well, why not?</p>
