        <p>The Kinder, Gentler Military</p>
        <p>Can America's Gender-Neutral</p>
        <p>Fighting Force Still Win Wars?</p>
        <p>By Stephanie Gutmann.</p>
        <p>300 pp. New York:</p>
        <p>A Lisa Drew Book/Scribner. $25.</p>
        <p>At a time when the pope is apologizing for the Crusades and the Inquisition, when globalization and pollution are rendering national boundaries obsolete and when a growing chorus of men and women is calling for the transformation of the military into a peacekeeping force so that the planet itself will make it, Stephanie Gutmann, a freelance writer, has written an impassioned defense of the warrior culture and the vision of masculinity it sustains. ''The Kinder, Gentler Military'' calls for an end to ''a huge social experiment'' in gender neutrality that has sought to mix an ethic of valor with ''a new value system'' that worships ''sensitivity.'' Gutmann's issue is not women per se but the compromise of standards.</p>
        <p>Gutmann's assumption is that war is part of man's nature. Her book was occasioned by what she sees as the ''politically driven 'reformation' ''of the American military over the past decade through a policy of integrating women completely. This policy, she says, has undermined readiness. Leaving aside the contested question of whether the technology of modern warfare renders physical differences between men and women inconsequential, the assumption that ''full-scale war'' is inevitable is debatable. Human cultures exist that do not go to war; even cultures with a history of warfare have maintained peace for long periods of time. To see war as a consequence of, rather than the rationale for, an ethos of aggressiveness, competition, fearlessness and unquestioning loyalty turns her argument about sex differences on its head, because it suggests that a particular set of social and cultural arrangements linking manhood with valor and womanhood with sensitivity is itself among the causes of war.</p>
        <p>I think Gutmann is correct in associating war, as it traditionally has been fought, with ''something called the Patriarchy.'' She quotes (disapprovingly) Lt. Gen. Claudia J. Kennedy, the Army's highest-ranking woman -- yes, the General Kennedy who recently filed a sexual harassment complaint against another Army general -- telling cadets at West Point a few years ago ''this is not your father's Army anymore.'' Gutmann has a short fuse for current efforts to change the politics of relationships between men and women; she ridicules the military's response to the 1991 Tailhook convention, seeing in it a capitulation to a humorless social work ethos that has ''lowered morale and has driven people out of the forces.'' She celebrates ''the guys who risk violent death every day and think it's a gas.'' She identifies the force behind ''the New Military'' as ''feminists or the women's movement'' -- the 'personal is political' crowd'' -- that in the 1990's got its way with a military already ''feeling defensive'' and ''worried about irrelevancy'' and weakened by budget cuts following the collapse of the Soviet Union.</p>
        <p>In an age when women can be astronauts, construction workers, surgeons and generals, it still remains true that compared with the average man, the average woman is shorter, has ''55 to 60 percent less upper-body strength, a lower center of gravity . . . a heart that can't move oxygen to the muscles as fast as a man's (i.e., 20 percent less aerobic capacity), and a rather more complicated lower abdomen.'' It is also true, in the Army as among Arctic explorers, that the presence of women changes the ethos of all-male environments, rendering it less violent. ''The Kinder, Gentler Military'' hinges not on the question of women's access to the military but rather on the question of changing -- that is, ''feminizing'' -- the military to accommodate women's presence. Can the sexes ''ever be truly 'equal' -- in the feminist sense, which equates equality with sameness and interchangeability?'' Gutmann asks. ''Is war an intrinsically 'male' endeavor or can it be sanitized by technology?''</p>
        <p>Feminists are split over whether the goal of women's liberation is to end male dominance by giving women access to power, or whether liberation means freeing both women and men to become more fully human. Gutmann endorses a natural law position, seeing aggression, imperialism and violence as hard-wired male attributes -- basic, primal, dictated by chemistry and hormones, as stubborn as the tides.'' But this argument has been severely challenged by researchers studying primates as well as cultures. More important, her argument conflates sex differences with the question of whether a value system that prizes valor is psychologically incompatible with one that also prizes sensitivity.</p>
        <p>Given the near universality of patriarchal societies and cultures, the natural law argument about sex differences readily becomes an example of the naturalistic fallacy -- the tendency to read culture as nature. Gutmann's case for hard-wired sex differences is flimsy. She quotes an Air Force maintenance officer turned corporate employee and novelist as her authority for the statement that ''men and women think about forming teams completely differently. Men think of teams as a bunch of people doing a job, told what to do by someone else; women think of a team as everybody talks about it and decides what to do.'' There is truth in the contention that men and women in general see and think about the world somewhat differently; I would find it astonishing if this were not the case, given the different situation of women and men in our society and culture. The growing gender gap in voting suggests that more women may now be holding to their own view. And if women, under current circumstances, are less likely ''to think of themselves and others just as a cog in the machine,'' as the former maintenance officer put it, this becomes, given the lessons of Nuremberg and My Lai, an argument for an all-woman military.</p>
        <p>Gutmann dedicates her book to her father, ''who told me his war stories.'' But his stories were about helping the Haganah smuggle Jews into Palestine through the British blockade of the 1940's. There is a slippage between this kind of hero and the ''professional killer'' it is her military's mission to train -- a slippage that creates the impression that something else is driving her argument.</p>
        <p>In recent history, the United States has undertaken three sweeping experiments in the cultural transformation of its armed forces. The first -- President Harry Truman's 1948 mandate to integrate blacks fully -- has been, as Gutmann notes, a glowing success. The second, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara's efforts, on behalf of the War on Poverty, to induct and educate the ''subterranean poor'' by lowering the test score requirements that had kept them out of the Army, was, she says, by and large a failure. The current policy of complete integration of women is the most radical because it challenges the military's underlying masculine ethos. Gutmann asks: ''Can the impulse that still impels men to try to protect women be overridden? Do we want it to be? Won't sex just always have its way? Do we really want it to stop doing that?''</p>
        <p>Gutmann's case for men-are-fierce-women-are-sensitive reduces to an evolutionary biology ''eggs-are-costly-sperm-is-cheap'' argument. It flies in the face of evidence (read Margaret Mead) that both women and men can be fierce in defending themselves and others without losing their sensitivity or sexuality. Clearly, ''the armed forces exist to defend us and advance our interests.'' But the question remains: who are ''we'' and what are our interests? For years Virgil's ''Aeneid'' was taught in high schools as a celebration of the warrior ethos. Pious Aeneas, a man who flees the burning city of Troy carrying his aged father and leading his young son, loses his sensitivity in the course of founding Rome and becomes ''savage Aeneas,'' killing brutally and senselessly to maintain his honor. Virgil left his great epic unfinished.</p>
        <p>Classical scholars have pointed out that in ostensibly celebrating the warrior culture of Rome under Augustus, Virgil also rendered its darkness visible. Ironically, Gutmann's book does the same. Her unflinching descriptions of the psychological stripping of humanity in the course of basic training undercut her argument by showing us exactly how we have managed over the millenniums to create brutality. While all transformation is messy, it is possible that our current experiment in creating a military that is both effective and sensitive could, like the racial integration of the American armed forces, also prove a glowing success.</p>
