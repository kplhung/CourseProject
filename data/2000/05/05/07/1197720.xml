        <p>Diane Blum and her staff knew what to expect when Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani announced that he had prostate cancer.</p>
        <p>''Anytime a public figure talks about having cancer, the calls increase,'' said Ms. Blum, executive director of Cancer Care, a nonprofit group in New York that has offered free counseling, education and financial help to cancer patients since 1944.</p>
        <p>Although one-on-one counseling remains Cancer Care's bread and butter -- its 45 professional social workers helped more than 30,000 New Yorkers last year -- the group also has a Web site.</p>
        <p>Started in 1996, the site logs 75,000 user sessions each week, with many people visiting it shortly after diagnosis.</p>
        <p>WHAT YOU SEE -- A pair of cupped hands occupies the physical and emotional center of the site. ''Special Sections,'' on the right side of the home page, directs viewers to pages at which patients can learn about their illnesses, receive advice on coping with side effects and emotional strains, and obtain additional support. The section also includes features on finding clinical trials, dealing with fatigue and pain, and addressing end-of-life concerns.</p>
        <p>The site's general resources include an online version of the group's 140-page directory of national, regional and local cancer groups. ''Legislative Alerts'' allows visitors to stay on top of health care bills that affect cancer patients, like the Patients' Bill of Rights. For those without ready access to the Internet, ''Teleconferences'' provides a schedule of seminars conducted over the phone by leading cancer experts.</p>
        <p>The section on the left of the home page highlights Cancer Care's major services. ''Getting Help'' gives an overview of the organization's programs, including online support groups, phone counseling and office locations and hours. ''Information Materials'' includes patient publications, archived teleconferences and recent cancer headlines on CNN Interactive. An abbreviated site is also available in Spanish.</p>
        <p>LINKS -- The site has links to hundreds of prescreened Web sites about specific cancers, clinical trials, financial assistance, experimental therapies and support groups.</p>
        <p>''One of the site's main purposes is to take visitors to credible links,'' Ms. Blum said.</p>
        <p>WHAT YOU GET -- A caring and reliable resource for cancer patients.</p>
