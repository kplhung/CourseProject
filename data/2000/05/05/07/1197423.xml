        <p>IF someone told 10-year-old Alexis Johnson to go fly a kite, she would be delighted.</p>
        <p>But on far too many days, she wouldn't be able to do it.</p>
        <p>Alexis, a third grader at George Washington Elementary School in White Plains, is one of an estimated 17 million Americans who have asthma, including 5 million who are under 18.</p>
        <p>The disease is the No. 1 cause of school absences attributed to chronic illnesses, accounting for 10 million lost school days  annually, according to the American Lung Association.</p>
        <p>This spring the Hudson Valley chapter of the lung association teamed up with local schools to help children learn how to cope with an asthma episode. In a series of six lessons taught by registered nurses, the children learned how to recognize and manage symptoms, how to solve problems with medicines, how to identify asthma triggers and how to control asthma episodes.</p>
        <p>''At school, the first line of defense for every asthmatic child is the school nurse,'' said JoAnn Gallagher, program director for the new program, which is called Open Airways for Schools. ''But what happens after school or on a weekend? A child and his or her parents need to be their own first line of defense and know how to manage an asthma episode with confidence.''</p>
        <p>The lessons for the students included role playing and art therapy. The work above was Alexis's response to an assignment to draw a picture about how she feels about her asthma -- a vision of a day that she dreams of, but cannot count on.</p>
        <p>More information about Open Airways and other programs is available from the American Lung Association of Hudson Valley at 949-2150 or at www.alahv.org.</p>
