        <p>Mom already has a Viking stove? Then maybe she's ready for a new vacuum cleaner, the next luxury home item. The new Guardian from Electrolux ($1,499) comes with a 25-year warranty, as well as a True-HEPA air-filtration system, which means that it is designed to absorb 99.97 percent of the microscopic dust particles (plus mites, pollen, bacteria) in the air in your home -- not to mention dust bunnies under the bed. Even better, Electrolux salespeople will come to your home to demonstrate (even in Spanish) how to use all the fancy attachments, perform a checkup one year after purchase and even deliver replacement bags day or night. Best of all, they do it in jackets and ties, the clean-cut look moms love. Electrolux can be reached at (800) 243-9078.</p>
