        <p>Clear Springs: A Family Story  By Bobbie Ann Mason. HarperPerennial, $14.</p>
        <p>The author revisits her old Kentucky home, and in recounting the details and Southern traditions of her upbringing sheds light on the inspiration for much of her fiction. ''Mason gets to the heart of a whole generation,'' Josephine Humphreys wrote here last year. ''She can write the hard truth about home, love, loss and the terrifying passage of time.''</p>
        <p>Italian Fever  By Valerie Martin. Vintage Contemporaries, $12.</p>
        <p>The author's sixth novel, about a young divorcee who travels to Tuscany to settle the affairs of an American writer who has died and left behind the manuscript of his final book, has more to do with the development of consciousness than plot. The heroine's adventures among the locals, particularly her sexual awakening at the hands of her charming cicerone, make this ''a study of the complications of lovemaking and its effects on women,'' Craig Seligman wrote here in 1999. ''Martin's sureness of phrasing is one of the great pleasures of her recent fiction. . . . Her cool, remote voice has mellowed, and her competence has kindled into brilliance.''</p>
        <p>In September, the Light Changes: Stories  By Andrew Holleran. Plume, $12.95.</p>
        <p>These carefully built tales are steeped in the cadences, vocabulary and concerns of gay life in the late 20th century, and reveal an obsessive awareness of the loss of friends, health and youth. The result is a ''beautifully observed'' collection that is ''unflinching, provocative, witty and shrewd,'' Peter Parker said here in 1999.</p>
        <p>The Diary of Vaslav Nijinsky: Unexpurgated Edition  Edited by Joan Acocella. Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux, $15.</p>
        <p>The legendary Russian dancer's diary, originally published by his wife in a sanitized, scaled-back version in 1936, chronicles his long, anguished struggle with insanity. ''In displaying its author in all his terrifying particularity, it allows us to glimpse in his madness, not the apotheosis, but at least the ruins, of his genius,'' William Deresiewicz wrote here in 1999. No IntermissionS: The Life of Agnes de Mille, by Carol Easton (Da Capo, $18), is a portrait of the combative American dancer, choreographer, author and lecturer who labored mightily to be taken seriously in the male-dominated genre of musical comedy. ''Easton tracks de Mille's struggles with the limits of her gift,'' Joan Acocella said here in 1996. ''De Mille fans will want to read the book.''</p>
        <p>A Journey to the End of the Millennium:  A Novel of the Middle Ages  By A. B. Yehoshua. Harvest/Harcourt, $14.</p>
        <p>This novel about a North African Jewish merchant who travels to Europe with his two wives and his Muslim partner in the year 999 explores the gaps between Jews and Christians, Jews and Muslims and men and women. ''Yehoshua is so graceful and eloquent that his work's timeliness also succeeds, paradoxically, in making it timeless,'' James E. Young wrote here last year.</p>
        <p>Someone to Watch Over Me: Stories  By Richard Bausch. HarperPerennial, $13.</p>
        <p>These tales eavesdrop on couples bantering in bars, in restaurants and in bed, and examine the human desire for solicitude and tenderness. ''Bausch hovers over his characters like the guardian angel they all seek,'' Lisa Zeidner wrote here in 1999. ''His stories illuminate the charged stillness in which emotional changes happen.''</p>
        <p>Weird and Tragic Shores:  The Story of Charles Francis Hall, Explorer  By Chauncey C. Loomis. Modern Library, $14.95.</p>
        <p>In 1968, the author exhumed the body of Charles Francis Hall, a 19th-century amateur explorer who made three Arctic voyages in search of survivors of Sir John Franklin's disastrous expedition of 1845, and he discovered traces of arsenic. This biography ''suggests who may have killed him,'' Edmund Carpenter wrote here in 1971. ''It is both a first-rate detective story and a very scholarly work.'' Modern Library has also reissued The Brendan Voyage, by Tim Severin ($14.95), a chronicle of Severin's trip across the North Atlantic in a small oxhide boat like the ones reputed to have been used by Irish monks on their way to the New World in the sixth century. ''His account of the adventure is a sailor's delight,'' one critic said in 1978. In Voyaging: Southward From the Strait of Magellan, by Rockwell Kent (Wesleyan University, $16.95), the artist recounts in rousing fashion his journey to Tierra del Fuego in a small sailboat. ''The strength and menace and majesty of the Cape Horn region proved admirable material for Kent's black-and-white drawings,'' the Book Review said in 1924.</p>
        <p>The Tree of Life  By Hugh Nissenson. Paul Dry, $14.95.</p>
        <p>In this novel as pioneer journal, a former minister abandons New England for a rugged life on the Ohio frontier in 1811. The book contains ''numerous small glories,'' Ivan Doig said here in 1985, and the author ''toils like a stump farmer to create verisimilitude.''</p>
        <p>Geographies of Home  By Loida Maritza Perez. Penguin, $12.95.</p>
        <p>The heroine of this first novel is torn between memories of her lush homeland in the Dominican Republic and concern for her impoverished family, which is losing its strength and identity in Brooklyn. ''The result is a deluge of intense imagery where the magical and the real occupy the same awful and sometimes sensual space,'' Erica Sanders said here last year.</p>
