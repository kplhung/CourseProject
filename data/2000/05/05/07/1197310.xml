        <p>LONG before ''Schindler's List'' came along, ''The Sorrow and the Pity'' had already redefined how we think and feel about the Holocaust.

        <p>Viewed today, ''The Sorrow and the Pity'' still seems like the fastest four and a half hours in the history of the cinema. Only now it's all the more illuminating in its original, undubbed French-language version (screening for the first time in this country for two weeks at the Film Forum, beginning May 12).

        <p>LONG before ''Schindler's List'' came along, ''The Sorrow and the Pity'' had already redefined how we think and feel about the Holocaust. Through profound revelation and catharsis, the landmark 1971 documentary by Marcel Ophuls personalized the harrowing Nazi occupation of France, delving into the psyches of a few fascinating participants. In analyzing the web of collaborators, resistance fighters and apathetic onlookers, and how they haunted -- and still haunt -- a nation, Mr. Ophuls elevated the documentary to a higher art form through the force of his subject and storytelling.</p>
        <p>Viewed today, ''The Sorrow and the Pity'' still seems like the fastest four and a half hours in the history of the cinema. Only now it's all the more illuminating in its original, undubbed French-language version (screening for the first time in this country for two weeks at the Film Forum, beginning May 12). The film's powerful eloquence has not diminished over the years, despite all we know about France's unrivaled complicity with the Nazis and its determined resistance movement.</p>
        <p>In this era of ''gotcha'' journalism and high-tech presentation, it's remarkable how moving and provocative the film's simple technique of cross-cutting casual conversation with newsreel footage remains. This stunning mosaic of contradictions and consequences extends from World War I and the Treaty of Versailles through May of '68, when students took to the streets to protest the policies of President de Gaulle, who had been the leader of the exiled Free French during the occupation.</p>
        <p>Divided into two parts, ''The Collapse'' and ''The Choice,'' the film reveals how militarily and emotionally ill-equipped France was to fight the Nazis. Everyone had his reasons. Some were anti-Communists sympathetic to national socialism. Some had too much to lose. Others just didn't care. But most had been too spiritually scarred by World War I. Therefore many lashed out at Jews and Communists; in one especially horrifying instance detailed in the film, French collaborators instigated the deportation of Jewish children to concentration camps.</p>
        <p>It should not come as a surprise, then, that Mr. Ophuls could not get French financing, or, at first, show the film on French television. It played in a single theater on the Left Bank in Paris, where it became a long-running hit. ''Many people in France still think it gives a 'message' about how the French behaved,'' Mr. Ophuls said by phone from his home in southwest France. ''This would be pompous, stupid and prosecutorial -- to make a statement about a country that has been defeated and had to live under these conditions for four years. I did not set this up to set up France for being collaborators. In times of great crisis, we make decisions of life and death. It's a lot to ask people to become heroes. You shouldn't expect it of yourself and others.''</p>
        <p>''The Sorrow and the Pity'' has had a wide influence: films ranging from ''Reds'' to ''This Is Spinal Tap'' show evidence of its interview format. Even ''The Blair Witch Project'' is a kindred spirit of sorts, as are most prominent documentaries made since 1971, including Claude Lanzmann's ''Shoah'' and Mr. Ophuls's own ''Hotel Terminus: The Life and Times of Klaus Barbie.'' In fact, it's hard to believe that without the conscience-raising impact of ''The Sorrow and the Pity,'' the notorious Nazi war criminal Barbie would have been brought to justice.</p>
        <p>Then there's ''Annie Hall.'' Woody Allen's Oscar-winning romantic comedy pays unexpected homage to the documentary -- twice. In a famous scene featuring Marshall McLuhan, Allen's Alvy Singer drags Diane Keaton's reluctant Annie to a screening of the film. At the end of ''Annie Hall,'' in something of a personal victory, Alvy informs us that Annie has dragged her new boyfriend to the film as well.</p>
        <p>In retrospect, ''The Sorrow and the Pity'' had far more to do with ''Annie Hall'' than we first realized back in 1977. The whole ''mockumentary'' technique, with Mr. Allen's speaking directly to the audience, was crucially inspired by the Ophuls film, along with its central theme of making the right choices in life. An ardent admirer and supporter of Mr. Ophuls, Mr. Allen is presenting the theatrical reissue of ''The Sorrow and the Pity,'' under the auspices of Milestone Films.</p>
        <p>''It seemed to me during the making of 'Annie Hall' that it was such a symbol that one could aspire to in terms of art and recreation, and worth one's time in the cinema -- a parallel to literature or theater,'' Mr. Allen said by phone from his Manhattan office. ''It was still fresh on my mind. It was such non-junk in a sea of mediocrity, with no attempt to be popular or commercial. It explored so much of the complexity. The attitudes. Future generations will have a taste of that era much more deeply. It's to the documentary what tragedy is to drama.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ophuls, 72, is the son of the great director Max Ophuls (''La Ronde''), a German Jew who fled with his family to France in the 30's before coming to Hollywood in 1941. For Marcel, then, making the film was a deeply personal experience. In ''The Sorrow and the Pity,'' he mixes anthropology, history, psychology and sociology to get at the truth (primarily leaving the judging to us). He shows us the aristocrats, peasants, shopkeepers and politicians of Clermont-Ferrand, a small industrial town near Vichy, the capital of the collaborationist Petain regime. Along the way, the film shatters the myth of a united French resistance. One resistance fighter claims that only social misfits joined the movement, because they had nothing to lose. Louis Grave, a farmer, rakes his field while proclaiming a newfound preference for pacifism. ''Only fanatics know why they're fighting,'' he says. When Ophuls asks him if he knows why he fought the Nazis, Mr. Grave, no fanatic, suggests that it was because they made a mess of France -- innocently contradicting himself.</p>
        <p>Denis Rake, during the war an English agent working in France, poignantly describes how he joined the resistance to overcome his fear of being considered a coward because of his homosexuality. But while posing as a transvestite cabaret performer, he fell in love with a Nazi who befriended him.</p>
        <p>Madame Solange, a beautician, nervously relates how she was tortured after the liberation for having supported Petain. As Mr. Ophuls digs deeper, he subtly uncovers her underlying anti-Semitism. In another of the film's charged interviews, Christian de la Maziere, an aristocrat who fought with the French Waffen SS division, recalls how his philosophical attraction to fascism was mixed with revulsion at wearing the Nazi uniform.</p>
        <p>There are other stories, equally disturbing and ambiguous, that link Mr. Ophuls's work with the spiritual legacy of his father. Like Max Ophuls, a self-described ''pessimistic realist,'' Marcel displays a rare talent for overlapping the past and the present, forcing us to embrace life's darker truths.</p>
