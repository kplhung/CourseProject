        <p>If Home Depot sold wines in New York State, it might feature Pindar's Winter White.</p>
        <p>Winter White has been sold to Long Islanders as long as some adults remember. It was the very first Pindar wine made, in 1983 (283 cases). At 14,000 cases today, it is one of the best-selling East Endwines.</p>
        <p>Doubtless Winter White is a cash cow for Dr. Herodotus Damianos, the owner of Pindar, in Peconic on the North Fork, and Duck Wall, in Water Mill on the South Fork. That would make sense. Given its qualities, at $8 it qualifies as a ''best buy.''</p>
        <p>A skillful blend of Cayuga white, riesling, chardonnay, gewurztraminer and viognier, the current, pleasantly aromatic version, like its predecessors not vintage-dated, distantly resembles low-price vins de pays, or country wines -- whites from remote regions of France -- that keen importers bring in for mass-market consumption. When wine snobs sneer at multipurpose Winter White, they fail to appreciate what real wine sophisticates understand: good is good, on every level.</p>
        <p>Some buyers will experience Winter White as dry, others as off-dry. What counts is that its light grapefruity tartness is appetite-quickening -- I started thinking of egg salad and of tuna sandwiches -- and that it is nicely balanced and smooth.</p>
        <p>Winter White is what you choose instead of a good beer; it's what you give Aunt Martha, who still thinks wineries are the Devil's workshop; it's the three droplets you give to a child who wants to feel grown-up; and at $14 it's the 1.5-liter money-saving quencher you pour at big, informal blowouts. Many stores sell both wines at discount.</p>
