        <p>Populated by star-crossed lovers -- both living and dead -- Beth Gutcheon's spooky and idiosyncratic sixth novel, MORE THAN YOU KNOW (Morrow, $24), opens quietly enough, with an old woman named Hannah reminiscing about her youthful fling in the isolated, picturesque Maine coastal village of Dundee. In a brilliantly circular, atmospheric narrative, Hannah's romance is interwoven with a deadly love story, set 100 years earlier, that will in turn mysteriously haunt her. In Hannah's Depression-era tale, the 17-year-old summers with her stepmother in an old Dundee schoolhouse, which proves to be possessed by a ghostly figure only Hannah sees -- a woman with ''burning colorless eyes that seemed to have no pupils.'' Hannah takes solace in the arms of blue-eyed Conary Crocker, Dundee's ''all-around wild seed,'' who charms her with lazy afternoon boat trips off deserted islands. These scary and sweet events alternate with the 1850's courtship of conventional young Claris Osgood by a taciturn fisherman named Danial Haskell; their later, horrifying marriage will scar their daughter and son and end in murder. The taut facility with which Gutcheon twines the two stories creates real suspense -- both in the exact fates of the couples and the identity of the ghost, who grows viciously vengeful. While Gutcheon cannily evokes the ephemerality of passion, she also evinces, with stark and elemental resonance, the way love and hatred shape lives.</p>
