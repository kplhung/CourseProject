        <p>DURING a lunch last month with Ann A. Fishman, a marketing consultant on generational issues, I had the eerie feeling that she had been reading my resume -- or my mind.</p>

        <p>DURING a lunch last month with Ann A. Fishman, a marketing consultant on generational issues, I had the eerie feeling that she had been reading my resume -- or my mind.</p>
        <p>She was talking about the characteristics of the so-called silent generation -- people too young to have struggled through much of the Great Depression and fought in World War II, but too old to be baby boomers. The ''silents,'' less numerous than the generations they are sandwiched between, are often overlooked by advertisers and other purveyors of popular culture who are obsessed with appealing to teenagers, young adults,  boomers or the elderly.</p>
        <p>This goes a long way toward explaining why I can surf through scores of cable channels and find so little to watch. It also tells me why a movie I like runs in theaters for only about 15 minutes, or why only one or two copies of it are stocked at the video store.</p>
        <p>''The G.I. generation gets attention, and rightly so, because of its role in World War II; the boomers get attention because of their numbers,'' said Ms. Fishman, who is president of the Generational-Targeted Marketing Corporation, based in New Orleans. ''History has forced the silents, members of a transitional generation, to be overlooked.''</p>
        <p>Members of the silent generation are now in their mid-50's to mid-70's. A total of 49 million of them were born, compared with 79 million boomers (who would now be in their early 40's to mid-50's) and 63 million of the G.I. generation (now in their mid-70's to late 90's), according to ''Generations: The History of America's Future, 1584 to 2069,'' by William Strauss and Neil Howe (William Morrow, 1991).</p>
        <p>Ms. Fishman, who has also served as a fellow with the Senate Special Committee on Aging, is careful to note that not everyone in a generational group is alike, but they do tend to share certain characteristics. ''The G.I. generation, for instance, is a generation of doers who believe the good life has to be earned,'' she said. ''Baby boomers tend to be self-absorbed and rebellious against authority; they were the main force in the antiwar movement in the Vietnam era. Silents have always done the right things. They did what their parents told them. They are reliable and show up for work on time. Silents tend to be helpers and teachers, and their generation has produced most of the great civil rights leaders -- but not a president.''</p>
        <p>AS the silents age, many are beginning to panic, because they have never had a great adventure. They were not called on to save the world, as the G.I. generation was, and they have not been as wrapped up in satisfying themselves as the boomers have been.</p>
        <p>''They think they are due,'' Ms. Fishman said. ''They want more of a taste of life. Many see it as now or never.''</p>
        <p>That now-or-never feeling is one reason that many workers in their late 50's and early 60's are choosing to retire early and to proceed on their own terms -- perhaps in other work -- in what some experts call a second middle age, made possible partly by advances in medicine and healthier lifestyles. And, thanks to the long economic boom, many of them can afford it.</p>
        <p>Joe Taylor, who will be 56 next month, retired last May from a career as a school psychologist in Corydon, Ind., to start a woodworking business in his home.</p>
        <p>''I didn't do this for the money,'' Mr. Taylor said. ''I was tired of what I had been doing and wanted to do something more creative. I find woodwork satisfying. People enjoy what I make.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor is keenly aware of the role that history can play in shaping generations. When he was in college in the early 1960's, he used a student deferment to avoid being drafted and sent to Vietnam. ''I regret that to this day,'' he said. ''I missed my war.''</p>
        <p>People like Mr. Taylor should serve as a wake-up call to corporations and other employers who often overlook silent-generation workers. Ms. Fishman contends that unless companies move aggressively to retain the silents, they risk losing valuable workers who are at the peak of their expertise.</p>
        <p>''They also risk losing valuable mentors who help them retain younger workers,'' she said. ''The Generation Xers, whom companies complain they can't keep, get along much better with the silents than with boomers. Gen Xers like being mentored because it gives them a sense of family, which many are lacking. So silents are not only the top performers in the workplace, they are a key to retaining younger workers.''</p>
        <p>One way to keep silents on the job, she suggested, is to offer work schedules that allow blocks of time off -- perhaps three or four months a year -- for adventure or self-fulfillment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor likes that idea. ''If my school had offered me something like that,'' he said, ''presumably at a reduced salary, I would have stayed on.''</p>
