        <p>I think the best portraits don't necessarily show you what somebody looks like, but they tell you what somebody is about. So the one where you see me looking at a book, that's what I'm about - my thinking process and how I relate to my experience as human being. I have a constant problem because I'm always having to circumvent what the camera does best, which is reproduce observable reality. I'm much more interested in what something feels like than what it looks like.</p>
