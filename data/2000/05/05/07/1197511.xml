        <p>OVER a half-century ago in England a woman named Margery worked for an autocratic newspaper editor named Walter Fish. Eventually the two married, retired to the country, and created a garden. Margery Fish described their triumphs, tribulations and disagreements in her 1956 book, ''We Made a Garden.''</p>
        <p>Though bound together by marital vows and common interests, the Fishes were not always compatible in the garden. Walter had a passion for well-disciplined lawns and paths.  Margery was less foursquare, preferring to have small plants such as arabis and hardy geranium spilling out of every nook and cranny.</p>
        <p>Walter had a yen for the larger more impressive specimens, which, according to Margery, gave him ''a good return for his money.'' Fortunately for the health of the garden and the relationship, they agreed on the importance of staking and deadheading.</p>
        <p>''We Made a Garden'' might just as easily have been called ''I Made A Compromise,'' because Margery frequently did. Compromise, whether hard won or accomplished with ease, seems to be the rule whenever two gardeners share one piece of land.</p>
        <p>My neighbors, Tova and Zachary Narrett, share a Victorian house that they have renovated together. Their garden is a work in progress, and the collaboration is evolving along with the planting schemes.</p>
        <p>On the surface, the Narretts seem to have a symbiotic relationship. ''I love planning and planting, but I don't like maintenance,'' said Tova, a clothing designer. ''Zach loves weeding, watering and pruning.''</p>
        <p>Tova also loves white flowers, and in the spring, the front yard is dotted with the predominantly white daffodils that she planted underneath a spreading carpet of English ivy. This year, the daffodils will be joined by white Iceberg roses.</p>
        <p>''Whenever we go to the garden center, I point out the white flowers,'' Tova said. Zachary, however, longs for color. In the past he has encouraged his wife to include a few blues and yellows amidst the billows of white. If you look carefully at the daffodil display in the front yard, you can see a few yellow trumpets and perianths here and there.</p>
        <p>Zachary's influence is limited in the front yard, but it will eventually be felt in the back where the Narretts plan to plant a formal garden.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, Zachary regards himself as ''a consultative partner.''  He has helped Tova select peony varieties and ground covers and has done lots of digging. Zachary admitted that while the couple doesn't always see eye-to-eye about plans and plants, they have a shared aesthetic sensibility that leads to horticultural harmony. ''Usually we come to an agreement,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Colleen and Joseph Hart are in the process of renovating their suburban yard, having removed faltering shrubs and unhealthy grass last year. Their gardening partnership hinges on the ability to set boundaries. ''He likes a very manicured look,'' said Colleen, a hairdresser, who has achieved a form of geographical detente with her husband. JOSEPH HART can implement his schemes for manicured shrubs, immaculate lawn and borders of crushed stone in front of the house. Colleen will use the side and the rear to plant hydrangeas and other flowering shrubs, install a rose arbor and cultivate a vegetable garden. Colleen envisions her part of the property as free-flowing and romantic, in contrast to Joseph's tightly controlled environment.</p>
        <p>The couple is not completely at odds. Joseph is in the process of finishing construction on the fence that will bound his wife's backyard space, and he will also build the arbor for Colleen's roses. The two share a fondness for impatiens, which Joseph has used in front of the house and Colleen plans to install in her shady side border.</p>
        <p>As for the end result, Colleen said simply, ''I don't know what he'll think of it.''</p>
        <p>Ultimately when couples share gardens, the results speak for themselves. Intractable behavior doesn't usually result in bountiful harvests.  Still, for those afflicted with a partner like Walter Fish, it is comforting to note that Margery Fish found a way to have the ultimate last word about their garden collaboration. She wrote a book.</p>
