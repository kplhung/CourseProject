        <p>Three livery-cab drivers were robbed early yesterday in apparently unrelated incidents in Brooklyn and Queens, the police said.</p>
        <p>The first victim was a driver for the Emerald Car Service, who was sent to pick up a passenger at 2217 Voorhees Avenue in Coney Island, shortly after midnight, the police said.</p>
        <p>The passenger asked to be taken to West 33rd Street and Neptune Avenue, but asked to stop along the way, saying he saw three friends, the driver told officers. The three men got into the car and one man then pulled out a shotgun and took $100 from the driver.</p>
        <p>About an hour later, a driver for the Parsons Car Service picked up two men at the Amazura club, at 144th Street in Jamaica, Queens, the police said. At Atlantic Avenue and the Van Wyck Expressway, one of the two men drew a gun and demanded money from the driver, taking $95, the police said.</p>
        <p>In the third case, a driver with the Mega Car Service picked up a passenger who hailed him at 45th Street and Fourth Avenue in the Sunset Park section of Brooklyn, the police said. The passenger asked the driver to take her to 19th Street and Third Avenue, where she threatened him with a knife and demanded his money.</p>
        <p>The driver gave the woman $45, and the woman hit him in the head with her fists and fled, the police said.</p>
