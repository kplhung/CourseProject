        <p>Bill Pulsipher sat at his locker tonight and kept shaking his head. For the second straight outing, the Mets pitcher wasn't hit hard, but he still met with decisive failure.</p>
        <p>''When the hardest ball they hit was by the pitcher, I don't know what to say,'' he said after the Mets were routed by the Florida Marlins, 9-1, at Pro Player Stadium.

        <p>Bill Pulsipher sat at his locker tonight and kept shaking his head. For the second straight outing, the Mets pitcher wasn't hit hard, but he still met with decisive failure.</p>
        <p>''When the hardest ball they hit was by the pitcher, I don't know what to say,'' he said after the Mets were routed by the Florida Marlins, 9-1, at Pro Player Stadium. ''They hit so many balls just out of the reach of guys or just in front of the outfielders. It's bound to turn around, because I feel I'm throwing the ball as well as I have in a long time.''</p>
        <p>Tonight was Pulsipher's second start since being recalled from Class AAA Norfolk. The veteran Bobby J. Jones is getting a rehabilitation start on Sunday in Norfolk and may return to the Mets (17-15) before long, so Pulsipher knew he had to pitch well to assure himself of a chance of remaining in his Mets uniform for the long term.</p>
        <p>Instead, Pulsipher never made it through the fourth inning. The Mets' eighth loss in 11 games came as the Marlins (15-16) ran rampant on Mike Piazza's arm and closer Armando Benitez had another shaky outing.</p>
        <p>The Marlins were cruising, 5-1, when Benitez called from the bullpen and told Manager Bobby Valentine he wanted to pitch an inning ''to work on some things.'' Big mistake, it turned out. He walked three and gave up two hits in a four-run eighth inning capped by Preston Wilson's grand slam. It was Benitez's fourth straight troublesome performance.</p>
        <p>''Whatever he was working on, it obviously didn't work out too well,'' Piazza said.</p>
        <p>Valentine described Benitez as strong mentally and someone who will rebound. Benitez left without speaking to reporters.</p>
        <p>The game began well enough for the Mets. Derek Bell opened the scoring with a bang in the fourth, driving an Alex Fernandez pitch an estimated 455 feet over the wall in left-center.</p>
        <p>Pulsipher pitched effectively until the bottom of that inning, when the Marlins strung together six hits to produce five runs. As Pulsipher said, most were not hit hard, but that was of little consolation to Valentine.</p>
        <p>''I don't think they killed the ball, but they got hits,'' said Valentine, who noted that Pulsipher will most likely get one more start.</p>
        <p>Pulsipher had a chance to avoid trouble early in the fourth. After Derrek Lee singled, Alex Gonzalez hit a popup toward short right field. It flicked off the outstretched glove of second baseman Edgardo Alfonzo.</p>
        <p>''That was a big one,'' Valentine said. ''With the runner going, if he makes that catch you have a double play and nobody on base.''</p>
        <p>As it turned out, Pulsipher made a 2-0 fastball to Fernandez a little too sweet, and the opposing pitcher hit his eighth career double, driving in two runs. Three softly hit singles later, Valentine had seen enough.</p>
        <p>That ended another disappointing game for Pulsipher (0-2). He gave up five runs and nine hits in three and a third innings. In his first start after being recalled by the Mets, he gave up four runs, three hits and four walks in three and a third innings last Monday against San Francisco.</p>
        <p>Tonight's game started reasonably well for Pulsipher. He walked the leadoff hitter, Luis Castillo, who promptly stole second, and allowed another walk before retiring the side. Pulsipher gave up two hits in the second, but got Castillo to ground out to end the inning. Then he allowed a double but no runs in the third.</p>
        <p>The Mets' half of the fourth proved pivotal. After Bell's home run, Alfonzo and Piazza singled. Robin Ventura, the only left-handed hitter  against the right-handed Fernandez, struck out swinging, and Alfonzo was caught trying to steal third.</p>
        <p>''I started the runner because I was trying to stay out of the double play, and I thought he would hit the ball,'' Valentine said. ''That's usually a pretty safe bet.''</p>
        <p>Todd Zeile walked, but Jay Payton grounded to second to end the inning.</p>
        <p>Completing this night of ignominy: Besides the Mets' ineffective bats, Florida stole five bases against Piazza. Three of them were by Castillo.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>TURK WENDELL, who missed Friday's game with a sprained right ankle, pitched Saturday night. He shut out the Marlins over one and a third innings, striking out two and walking one. . . . The third-base coach COOKIE ROJAS missed the game: on another side of town, he attended his son VICTOR's wedding. JOHN STEARNS filled in for Rojas.</p>
