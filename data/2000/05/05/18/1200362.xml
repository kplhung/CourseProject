        <p>Following are excerpts from prepared remarks by Governor George W. Bush of Texas today before Boeing workers, as provided by the Bush campaign.</p>
        <p>From the start of this campaign, I have defined some sharp disagreements with the Clinton-Gore administration. But today I want to address an important area of agreement. A pressing question now confronts the Congress, and it will not wait until the next president takes office.</p>
        <p>The issue is whether to extend normal trade relations to China on a permanent basis. This vote is one step in the process of drawing China into the world trading system. China is on the verge of joining the 136 members of the World Trade Organization. Congress must now decide whether the U.S. will gain the benefits of China's more open economy.</p>
        <p>The stakes are high, on all sides. For businesses, workers and farmers across our country, it will mean much lower trade barriers and enormous opportunities for U.S. exports. For the people of East Asia, it will affect their relations with the region's major power. For the people of China, it holds out the hope of more open contact with the world of freedom. In short, this will be among the most serious decisions our government will make this year.</p>
        <p>Last year, when I laid out my vision of a distinctly American internationalism, I said that we must see China clearly, not through the filters of posturing and partisanship. And today I am acting on that principle. I am here to urge all members of Congress, both Republicans and Democrats, to join together in making China a normal trading partner of the United States.</p>
        <p>I differ with the president and vice president on many issues regarding China and trade. They place their confidence in the Chinese regime as a ''strategic partner'' of the United States. I know they are a competitor. They have been inconsistent on Taiwan; I will be clear. They failed to obtain ''fast track'' trade negotiating authority. I will fight for it. They mishandled the global trade negotiations right here in Seattle. I will make expanding trade a consistent priority of my administration.</p>
        <p>Today, however, all of us who believe in a more open China -- in advancing the rule of law and trade -- must work together. This is not a Republican or Democratic concern. It is an American concern. This trade agreement is the work of 13 years and three administrations. We cannot let that work be undone.</p>
        <p>Let me explain why. There are three compelling reasons to support this agreement -- freedom, security and economics.</p>
        <p>First, trade with China will promote freedom. Freedom is not easily contained. Once a measure of economic freedom is permitted, a measure of political freedom will follow. China today is not a free society. At home, toward its own people, it can be ruthless. Abroad, toward its neighbors, it can be reckless.</p>
        <p>When I am president, China will know that America's values are always part of America's agenda. Our advocacy of human freedom is not a formality of diplomacy. It is a fundamental commitment of our country. It is the source of our confidence that Communism, in every form, has seen its day.</p>
        <p>I view free trade as an important ally in what Ronald Reagan called ''a forward strategy for freedom.'' The case for trade is not just monetary, but moral, not just a matter of commerce, but a matter of conviction. Economic freedom creates habits of liberty. And habits of liberty create expectations of democracy. There are no guarantees, but there are good examples, from Chile to Taiwan. Trade freely with China, and time is on our side. . . .</p>
        <p>Simply put: China is most free where it is most in contact with the world economy.</p>
        <p>Second, trade with China serves our own national interest, as well as the security interests of China's neighbors. China is not our ''strategic partner.'' But neither is it our enemy.</p>
        <p>As I've said before, China is a competitor, to be faced without ill will and without illusions. When I am president, China will have no doubts about our power and purpose in the region, about our strong commitment to democratic allies throughout Asia. But this is accomplished by confident diplomacy, strong alliances and the military might to back them up. It is not accomplished by hindering free trade or seeking to isolate China. . . .</p>
        <p>When both China and Taiwan are members of the W.T.O., both will need to apply global rules to their trade, including trade with one another, and the prospects for cross-straits relations should improve.</p>
        <p>Third, trade with China serves the economic interests of America. . . .</p>
        <p>The doors will open to providers of U.S. services -- the import-export trade, banking, insurance, telecommunications, accounting, computers, motion pictures and more. China will also adhere to W.T.O. rules on intellectual property rights and investments. And if Europe negotiates a better deal in these or any other areas, by the terms of the agreement we will get the same treatment. . . .</p>
        <p>It is worth making one more point, a very practical one: Defeat of this bill won't even keep China out of the W.T.O., since President Clinton has already agreed to its entry. A ''no'' vote would only prevent the U.S. from enjoying the benefits of China's market opening -- even as foreign rivals to American firms do enjoy those benefits.</p>
        <p>After last year's confusion in Seattle, a leader in the protectionist camp confidently declared that by excluding China from the W.T.O. the opponents hoped -- as he put it -- ''to deliver the last blow'' against our system of free trade. Neither the United States nor the world can afford such a setback. I believe that trade serves the deepest interests of our country and advances the hopes of the Chinese people for a freer society. Our greatest export is not food or movies or even airplanes. Our greatest export is freedom. The people of China stand ready to receive it. The demand has never been greater.</p>
