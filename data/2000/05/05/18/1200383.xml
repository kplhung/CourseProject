        <p>Craig O. McCaw, the cellular telephone pioneer, announced the completion yesterday of his investment group's $1.2 billion rescue of ICO Global Communications, which went bankrupt last summer developing a satellite telecommunications network.</p>
        <p>And, as expected, he also announced he would merge the company, renamed New ICO, with Teledesic L.L.C., the more ambitious satellite network partnership he founded with William H. Gates, the Microsoft chairman.</p>
        <p>The merged venture, to be called ICO-Teledesic Global Limited, will be run temporarily by Russell Daggatt, who is chief executive of Teledesic, and based in Bellevue, Wash. But Mr. McCaw, who will be chairman, is seeking a permanent chief executive, according to a person briefed on his plans. Richard Greco, ICO's chief executive, resigned yesterday to pursue other telecommunications work.</p>
        <p>The ICO reorganization plan requires Mr. McCaw, who controls 54 percent of New ICO, to file plans with the Securities and Exchange Commission to allow the minority stockholders to trade their shares, either publicly or privately, no later than March 31, 2001, said Roger Nyhus, a Teledesic spokesman.</p>
        <p>The values of New ICO and Teledesic depend on whether Mr. McCaw's consolidation strategy can restore faith in the satellite communications market. That faith has been badly shaken by the collapse of Motorola's Iridium network, ICO's fund-raising problems and weak demand for the satellite phone service that Globalstar Communications began offering in October.</p>
        <p>''It helps that someone with a demonstrated business sense in communications is in a position to run things,'' said Roger Rusch, an industry consultant, referring to Mr. McCaw's stellar track record of building McCaw Cellular into an enterprise that he sold to AT&amp;T for $11.5 billion in 1994. More recently, he helped turn around Nextel Communications, the wireless carrier based in Reston, Va.</p>
        <p>''But it's no guarantee for success,'' added Mr. Rusch, whose company, Telastra, advised ICO Global bondholders during the bankruptcy reorganization.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCaw disclosed his effort to keep ICO afloat last November. The investment group he organized has domestic and foreign investors, including Subhash Chandra, an entrepreneur from India who initially announced a competing bid for control of ICO Global.</p>
        <p>As Mr. McCaw's executives examined the troubled company, they concluded that its technology and marketing connections could be built into a business that would propel them toward their vision of Teledesic as going way beyond voice-only worldwide communications.</p>
        <p>In a statement issued yesterday, Mr. McCaw characterized the enterprises signed up to market ICO's service as an ''unrivaled global network of leading telecommunications companies'' and Mr. Nyhus said there had been discussions of possible ''synergies'' between ICO and Teledesic.</p>
        <p>Under the direction of McCaw executives, ICO has already begun revamping its ground stations to deliver limited Internet and data services over its planned 12-satellite network, in addition to voice traffic. The work also involves minor alterations to the satellites under construction by Hughes Space and Communications and a preliminary agreement for Hughes to build four spare satellites, according to an executive close to the negotiations.</p>
        <p>But Mr. McCaw denied a report in The Wall Street Journal yesterday that he would expand ICO's network to 20 satellites, giving $1 billion in new business to Hughes, which is being acquired by Boeing.</p>
        <p>ICO Global's first satellite exploded during its launching in March, but New ICO said it still planned to begin its service in 2003. That would be well ahead of Teledesic, which wants to put nearly 300 satellites in lower orbits, allowing it to handle Internet and data services.</p>
