        <p>All that glisters is . . . recycled glass at the private prayer garden (left) created by the landscape architect Andy Cao and his business partner, Stephen Jerrom. Mr. Jerrom says the two specialize in ''quick-fix, high-style inexpensive garden makeovers,'' relying largely on balls and chips of recycled glass.</p>
        <p>The prayer garden (at the home of Tiana Alexandra, a Vietnamese-American actress and filmmaker) is an example of one of those makeovers. It is part of a backdrop designed for rehearsals of Ms. Alexandra's one-woman play, ''Rice Dreams.'' To create it, Mr. Cao ''pulled out a lot of the junk, cleaned up the bamboo and laid in half a ton of glass balls.''</p>

        <p>Mr. Jerrom and Mr. Cao started two years ago with the photogenic makeover of their own garden in the Echo Park area of Los Angeles and projects like a glass installation in the lobby of Andre Balazs's Standard Hotel in West Hollywood. Now Mr. Cao is redesigning the gardens of Mr. Balazs's Chateau Marmont hotel in West Hollywood, as well as the gardens surrounding a new house by John Pawson in Sherman Oaks. Information about the work of Mr. Cao and Mr. Jerrom is available at (323) 666-2724 or glassgardendesign.com.</p>
