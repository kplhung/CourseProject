        <p>Israeli troops in southern Lebanon have begun evacuating outposts there in preparation for an overall pullout from the area by July.</p>
        <p>Two outposts well inside the nine-mile-wide strip of territory controlled by the Israelis were turned over this week to the South Lebanon Army, the Israeli-backed militia in the area.</p>
        <p>Other Israeli positions are being emptied of heavy equipment so they can be evacuated quickly.</p>
        <p>On Tuesday, a coastal outpost that had included a naval radar station at Ras Bayada, on the northwestern edge of the Israeli-held zone, was evacuated. On Monday, the Israelis left another outpost near the village of Taibe.</p>
        <p>''At this stage we've handed over forward positions to the S.L.A.,'' said a senior Israeli officer who spoke on condition of anonymity. ''These outposts are very close to villages where the S.L.A. men live, and will enable them to defend themselves.''</p>
        <p>The handovers appear to be intended to enable members of the Israeli-backed militia to continue functioning as locally based armed groups after the Israeli withdrawal.</p>
        <p>But the future of the South Lebanon Army's fighters, who have been condemned as traitors by the Lebanese government, remains unclear. The United Nations, which is likely to take on an enhanced peacekeeping role in the area after the Israelis depart, is said to be pressing for a disbanding of the militia.</p>
        <p>The Israeli officer said this week's handovers did not signal a speeding up of the timetable for the Israeli withdrawal, which is supposed to be completed by July. ''This is all according to the plan,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The army apparently intends to relinquish outlying positions that are more difficult to reach and defend, in preparation for a quick withdrawal from outposts closer to Israel. The process will gradually leave fewer soldiers exposed to attacks by guerrillas of Hezbollah, the Party of God, who have been fighting a war of attrition to oust the Israelis from southern Lebanon.</p>
        <p>The guerrillas have kept up their assaults this week, shelling Israeli outposts just over the border with Lebanon. Israeli officers say they are planning for a possible withdrawal under fire.</p>
        <p>Despite the fighting nearby, preparations for the pullback are in full swing along Israel's border with Lebanon. Frontier fences that were built inside Lebanese territory are being moved back to the boundary, military outposts jutting into Lebanon are being relocated, and mines that were laid across the border are being removed.</p>
        <p>Trying to improve the morale of jittery residents of Israeli border settlements who fear that the withdrawal will leave them exposed to guerrilla attacks, Prime Minister Ehud Barak today announced a government aid package for their communities. The $400 million program includes sewage, water and road projects, assistance to schools and business incentives.</p>
