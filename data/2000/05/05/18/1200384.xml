        <p>Voters turned down school budgets in many districts on Long Island and in Westchester County on Tuesday, leaving school administrators wondering today how much money taxpayers would be willing to be spend.</p>
        <p>Nineteen of 126 budgets were voted down on Long Island, the most since 1996, when districts began holding elections on the same day. And in Westchester, voters in 5 of 39 school districts rejected increased spending.</p>
        <p>''The whole thing is in a pressurized state,'' said Judith Chen, president of the Nassau-Suffolk School Boards Association. ''We are faced with increased enrollment and aging facilities. The state is demanding higher standards. To accomplish this, we have to provide staff, books and programs. These things cost.''</p>
        <p>In Nassau County, where the fiscal crisis has left many residents nervous about the prospect of property reassessment and higher taxes, the most hotly contested race was in Port Washington. A fight over an $86.7 million bond referendum and a 6.25 percent budget increase prompted shouting matches at public meetings, door-to-door leafleting and street-corner conversations about the elderly not caring about children.</p>
        <p>More than 8,000 people turned out in Port Washington on Tuesday, 40 percent of the town's registered voters, the largest tally on Long Island. The bond issue was voted down, 4,805 to 2,953, and the budget was defeated 4,120 to 3,954. Three Port Washington school board members were swept from office.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately, it was an across-the-board defeat,'' said Dr. Albert F. Inserra, superintendent of the Port Washington School District. ''I think we were asking for too much and were too aggressive.''</p>
        <p>Districts where the budgets were defeated will hold new elections in a few weeks. If those budgets fail to pass, state law mandates a 2.6 percent spending increase plus additional costs for new students based on a state formula.</p>
        <p>The proposed budgets were up 6.5 percent on average over last year, nearly three times the rate of inflation, said Phoebe Goodman, executive director of the Nassau Citizens Budget Committee. ''They weren't able to tell the voters why the increases were needed,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The other seven districts in Nassau that voted down budgets were Farmingdale, Glen Cove, Herricks, Malverne, Plainedge, Westbury and Roosevelt, the first to be taken over by the state because of low student achievement, unsafe conditions in the schools and poor management.</p>
        <p>Among the districts that passed budgets was Uniondale, where voters approved a tax increase of 18 percent, about $240 for the average homeowner, to finance a budget of $99 million.</p>
        <p>In Suffolk County, 11 districts failed to pass budgets. The reason, according to Dr. Eric Eversley, district superintendent of the Eastern Suffolk Board of Cooperative Educational Service: most of those communities have recently approved large bond issues for the repair and construction of new schools.</p>
        <p>''Voters have not separated in their minds the difference between a bond referendum and a budget vote, and that those dollars are used for different purposes,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Taxpayers in Patchogue balked at a 4 percent budget increase after agreeing to a $150 million bond issue in March for the upgrade of schools. And in Sag Harbor, the $15 million budget failed to pass on a tie vote. Nearly $1 million was earmarked to pay interest on money that was borrowed to improve schools. School budgets in Amityville, Babylon, East Quogue, Elwood, Longwood, Mount Sinai, Shoreham, Three Village and West Islip were also defeated.</p>
        <p>In Westchester, where voters in 5 of 39 school districts defeated spending plans, proposed property tax increases of up to 23 percent appeared to be a major reason.</p>
