        <p>Money manager Stanley Shopkorn said yesterday that he would leave his job as chief stock picker at Moore Capital Management, a $10 billion investment management business.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Shopkorn, 57, added that he was not permanently retiring. '''My son's graduating from college and my daughter from graduate school,'' he said. ''I'm going to take some time off. I've done this for 32 years.''</p>

        <p>Money manager Stanley Shopkorn said yesterday that he would leave his job as chief stock picker at Moore Capital Management, a $10 billion investment management business.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Shopkorn, 57, added that he was not permanently retiring. '''My son's graduating from college and my daughter from graduate school,'' he said. ''I'm going to take some time off. I've done this for 32 years.''</p>
        <p>As prominent managers of hedge funds leave the business in a wave, Mr. Shopkorn joins Julian H. Robertson Jr., who said he was closing his Tiger Management hedge fund empire in late March, and George Soros's top money managers, Stanley F. Druckenmiller and S. Nicholas Roditi, who said they would retire in April.</p>
        <p>Mr. Soros and Mr. Robertson have suffered steep losses this year because of stock market volatility, but Moore has held up better. The firm's flagship funds, Moore Global Investment and Remington, have declined 4 percent to 5 percent this year, and their combined assets have dropped from $9 billion at the beginning of the year to $8.3 billion last week. About half that reduction stemmed from investors asking for redemptions, with the firm choosing to return the remainder.</p>
        <p>By contrast, Mr. Soros' Quantum Fund has dropped 20 percent this year while its assets have declined from $10.4 billion at the start of the year to $7.1 billion last week, both from market performance and shareholder redemptions. When announcing his management changes, Mr. Soros said he would remodel Quantum on a more conservative frame. The fund now has 80 percent to 90 percent in cash, according to someone close to the operation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Shopkorn, too, has apparently steered a more conservative course recently. He said he has trimmed his technology holdings in particular and equities overall, though he declined to provide specifics.</p>
        <p>A well-known figure on Wall Street, Mr. Shopkorn was once vice chairman and chief of equities trading at the brokerage firm Salomon Brothers. In the early 1990's, he left Salomon to start a hedge fund. After some publicized struggles, he closed that fund and, in 1996, was hired by Louis Moore Bacon, Moore's chief executive, to run its equity operations.</p>
        <p>The firm's top stock holdings, at the end of March, included Minnesota Mining &amp; Manufacturing, the Internet security company Verisign and the News Corporation, according to regulatory filings. Mr. Shopkorn said he had sharply reduced his funds technology position in late March and April, mitigating the damage from April's correction in technology stocks.</p>
        <p>In a letter to shareholders this week, Mr. Bacon said that Mr. Shopkorn had signed on for five years and was now ready to leave ''with the goal of simplifying his life.''</p>
