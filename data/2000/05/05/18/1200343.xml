        <p>Louise Tanner, a writer whose work often mirrored her Social Register upbringing, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78.</p>
        <p>The widow of Edward Everett Tanner 3rd, who, as Patrick Dennis, wrote ''Auntie Mame,'' Ms. Tanner was herself the author of five books, including the novel ''Miss Bannister's Girls,'' inspired by her experiences as a student at Miss Chapin's, a New York finishing school.</p>
        <p>Born Louise Frith Stickney, Ms. Tanner grew up in what she called ''Edwardian opulence'' on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She demonstrated her writing talent at an early age by winning Vogue magazine's Prix de Paris. After graduating from Vassar in 1944 she met Mr. Tanner; they were married four years later, preventing her, she once remarked, from having ''wound up a very embittered ex-debutante.''</p>
        <p>Her wry, wisecracking persona made her the perfect counterpart to her husband, who based one of the main characters in his 1962 best seller, ''Genius,'' on his wife. He also cast her in the role of Pixie Portnoy in his 1961 novel, ''Little Me,'' which was made into a Broadway musical.</p>
        <p>In addition to two social histories  ''Here Today'' (1959) and ''All the Things We Were'' (1968), Ms. Tanner wrote two novels for young adults, ''Reggie and Nilma'' and ''Dr. IRT.''  She is survived by a son, Michael; a daughter, Betsy; and a grandchild, all of New York.</p>
