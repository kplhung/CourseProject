        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As president and chief executive of USLaw.com, I was surprised that a few high-quality sites, including ours, were left out of ''Untangling the Legal Maze by Surfing the Web'' (May 11). USLaw.com was the first site to introduce the Ask a Lawyer feature, and it has been available around the clock seven days a week since January. PrairieLaw.com also should be recognized as a leader in online community functions.</p>
