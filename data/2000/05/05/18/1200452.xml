        <p>Hoping to attract more black support for a compromise bill that would remove the Confederate battle flag from the dome of South Carolina's Statehouse the State Senate voted today to reduce the size of the flagpole that would fly the flag to 25 feet from 30.</p>
        <p>The flagpole would still be in front of the Statehouse in Columbia, and the N.A.A.C.P. still opposes the plan and will continue its tourism boycott of the state. But some black House members have indicated that they may vote for the bill now.</p>

        <p>Hoping to attract more black support for a compromise bill that would remove the Confederate battle flag from the dome of South Carolina's Statehouse the State Senate voted today to reduce the size of the flagpole that would fly the flag to 25 feet from 30.</p>
        <p>The flagpole would still be in front of the Statehouse in Columbia, and the N.A.A.C.P. still opposes the plan and will continue its tourism boycott of the state. But some black House members have indicated that they may vote for the bill now.</p>
        <p>Two black lawmakers who voted against the measure last week said today that they would now accept it as the lesser of two evils. Because the Senate amended the bill, it must now be returned to the House, probably next week, for final approval before going to the governor.</p>
