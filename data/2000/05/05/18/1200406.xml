        <p>Japan is expected to announce as early as Thursday that W. L. Ross &amp; Company, an investment concern run by the bankruptcy specialist Wilbur L. Ross, has been chosen to take over Kofuku Bank, a regional bank in Osaka that failed in May 1999, according to people close to the deal. The sale indicates that contrary to recent speculation, the government has not closed the door to potential acquisitions of banks by foreigners.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ross has been a committed investor in Asia since financial crisis shook the region in 1997-98, promoting his vision of the opportunities that lay in ''vulture investing'' there -- the purchase of distressed assets.</p>
        <p>As senior managing director at Rothschild Ltd., before starting his own firm earlier this year, he pledged $1 billion to revive the bankrupt Halla group in South Korea, and also invested in a bankrupt Japanese auto parts supplier, Nikko Electric.</p>
        <p>Banking industry analysts say that Japanese regional banks badly need to consolidate and lower costs, but progress has been slow. A string of smaller banks -- Tokyo Sowa Bank, Kokumin Bank, Niigata Chuo Bank and Kofuku -- went under last year, in spite of the availability of public funds intended to help faltering financial institutions. Kofuku had excess liabilities of 52.3 billion yen, or $428 million at the time.</p>
        <p>The emergence in the marketplace of foreign-backed buyers may accelerate the pace of change by intensifying competition. There have been rumors that Ripplewood Holdings of New York, the lead investor in a group that purchased the insolvent Long-Term Credit Bank last year, is interested in Tokyo Sowa. Mr. Ross has said he sees merit in assembling a stable of regional Japanese banks.</p>
