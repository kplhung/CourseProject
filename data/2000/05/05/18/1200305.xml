      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Elisa Monte and David Brown have mellowed in recent years. They once seemed determined to examine every facet of a dance concept. But the two new pieces presented by Monte/Brown Dance on Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater were short and concise, allowing the audience to participate in the imaginative life of each work.</p>
        <p>To say that Ms. Monte's ''Day's Residue'' is a dance about skirts and frock coats is not at all to diminish the piece. The idea for it came from a score in which Bach themes bubble, burst and ooze up through churning music by Vladimir Godar. The eight dancers are tethered-looking elements in roiling centripetal patterns, eventually pushing toward diffuse light at the center of the stage. The women's tops and the men's pants are black. But slashes of swirling color cut through that dark unyielding atmosphere.</p>

        <p>Elisa Monte and David Brown have mellowed in recent years. They once seemed determined to examine every facet of a dance concept. But the two new pieces presented by Monte/Brown Dance on Tuesday night at the Joyce Theater were short and concise, allowing the audience to participate in the imaginative life of each work.</p>
        <p>To say that Ms. Monte's ''Day's Residue'' is a dance about skirts and frock coats is not at all to diminish the piece. The idea for it came from a score in which Bach themes bubble, burst and ooze up through churning music by Vladimir Godar. The eight dancers are tethered-looking elements in roiling centripetal patterns, eventually pushing toward diffuse light at the center of the stage. The women's tops and the men's pants are black. But slashes of swirling color cut through that dark unyielding atmosphere.</p>
        <p>The women's long, full skirts, gathered like bustles at the back, are brightly iridescent. There are duller echos whenever the men's jumps or fast turns ruffle the jackets' colored underskirts. Program notes reveal that the dance's somewhat clumsy title was suggested by the Freudian notion that insignificant daily occurrences in dreams may be used to work through archetypal issues. That idea is borne out clearly in ''Day's Residue,'' with help from Karen Young, who designed the imaginative costumes, and Clifton Taylor, whose lighting creates a sense of a dark place.</p>
        <p>Should dances need program notes? Mr. Brown's notes for his new ''Let's Misbehave'' explain that the choreography represents an investigation of his own response to four American song classics by Cole Porter. (Unhelpfully, he does not list the titles or performers of the taped songs.) But the sense of a distinctive individual response does not carry through the entire suite.</p>
        <p>''Let's Misbehave'' gets off to a terrific start with a male quartet, set to the song of the same name, which is full of high-energy goofy dance performed by insouciant men in evening wear. Mr. Brown gives a sly twist to the third section's song title, ''How Could We Be Wrong?,'' by pairing his eight dancers in heterosexual and same-sex couples. And he allows himself to indulge in a sweeping grand finale in the closing dance, ''Begin the Beguine.''</p>
        <p>The slight tension in Mr. Brown's differing degrees of response to the songs' lyrics becomes uncomfortably pronounced in the second section, a female quartet to ''Love for Sale.'' Here and throughout the suite of dances, the singers bring a kind of heedless ebullience to the songs. The effect is ironic in ''Love for Sale,'' given its chill, disturbing lyrics. But there is no irony in Mr. Brown's pretty romp for four pretty women.</p>
        <p>The good-looking, skillful dancers in both new pieces were Fabrice Lamego, Brian McGinnis, Nadine Mose, Caroline Nehr, Yvette Perry, Marden Ramos, Akari Sasaki and Bradley Shelver. The lighting and costumes for ''Let's Misbehave'' were by Mr. Taylor and Ms. Young.</p>
        <p>The program, which will be repeated tomorrow, Saturday and Sunday nights, also includes Ms. Monte's ''Amor Fati'' and Mr. Brown's ''Run to the Rock.''</p>
