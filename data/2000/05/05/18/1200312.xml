        <p>In a week in which all the networks are announcing their new fall television lineups, CBS is the first to take the bold step of predicting flat out that it has a hit series on its hands.</p>
        <p>It's ''The Bette Show,'' a new comedy starring Bette Midler, and CBS is demonstrating its ultimate faith in it by scheduling it on Wednesday at 8 p.m., where it will challenge the ABC juggernaut ''Who Wants To Be a Millionaire.''</p>
        <p>CBS executives called it the best comedy they have developed in years. It had better be, because it will lead off CBS's Wednesday night lineup against ''Millionaire'' and will shelter another new comedy, ''Welcome to New York,'' under its wing. The executives said they were trying to expand the store of comedies because CBS really has only one night, Monday, on which comedies have worked. So CBS is adding three.</p>
        <p>''The Bette Show'' will get the most attention because it is Ms. Midler's first attempt at a television series. Essentially, she plays a fictionalized version of herself, an entertainer who keeps her household in turmoil, including a professor husband and a 13-year-old daughter trying to escape her mother's outsize image. She also has a manager and an accompanist: Ms. Midler is expected to sing every week.</p>
        <p>''Welcome to New York'' stars Christine Baranski as a producer of a morning television show in New York. The show hires a green weatherman from Indiana played by the stand-up comedian Jim Gaffigan.</p>
        <p>The network's third new comedy  gets the best spot on the CBS schedule, Monday nights at 8:30 between ''King of Queens'' and ''Everybody Loves Raymond.'' It is ''Yes, Dear,'' a show about two couples whose life styles differ widely, especially when it comes to raising children. The show stars Mike O'Malley, who failed spectacularly with a comedy for NBC last season.</p>
        <p>CBS's four new dramas are headed by a show that few took seriously when it was first proposed: a remake of the classic series ''The Fugitive.'' It is basically the same as the one that set ratings records in the 60's with David Janssen and then became a hit film starring Harrison Ford. It now stars Tim Daly as Dr. Richard Kimble, who escapes execution and hunts for the one-armed man he believes killed his wife. One switch is that his pursuer, Lieutenant Gerard, is an African-American with his own personal baggage. He is played by Mykelti Williamson.</p>
        <p>''C.S.I.,'' another crime drama, is about a criminal investigation unit that uses forensic science to solve crimes in Las Vegas. It stars William Petersen and Marg Helgenberger. A third crime-oriented drama, ''The District,'' stars Craig T. Nelson as a police commissioner in Washington. Finally there is ''That's Life,'' a family drama about a 30-year-old woman who returns to college. It stars Heather Paige Kent and Ellen Burstyn.</p>
        <p>CBS is dropping ''Early Edition,'' ''Ladies Man,'' ''Cosby,'' ''Martial Law'' and ''Now and Again.'' It has also juggled the time periods of its three Thursday night shows.</p>
        <p>Here is the new CBS schedule:</p>
        <p>MONDAY:  'Kings of Queens,'' ''Yes, Dear,'' ''Everybody Loves Raymond,'' ''Becker,'' ''Family Law.''</p>
        <p>TUESDAY:  ''JAG,'' ''60 Minutes II,'' ''Judging Amy.''</p>
        <p>WEDNESDAY:  ''The Bette Show,'' ''Welcome to New York,'' movies.</p>
        <p>THURSDAY:  ''48 Hours,'' ''City of Angels,'' ''Diagnosis Murder.''</p>
        <p>FRIDAY:  ''The Fugitive,'' ''C.S.I.'' ''Nash Bridges.''</p>
        <p>SATURDAY:  ''That's Life,'' ''Walker, Texas Ranger,'' ''The District.''</p>
        <p>SUNDAY:  ''60 Minutes,'' ''Touched By an Angel,'' movies.</p>
