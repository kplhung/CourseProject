        <p>Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa denied charges today that when he was prime minister he bribed a politician for his silence.</p>
        <p>The politician, Kishiro Nakamura, construction minister from 1992 to 1993, said in court on Monday that Mr. Miyazawa handed him a paper bag with three million yen, or $27,000 at current exchange rates, in cash on a visit to the prime minister's residence in 1991.</p>

        <p>Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa denied charges today that when he was prime minister he bribed a politician for his silence.</p>
        <p>The politician, Kishiro Nakamura, construction minister from 1992 to 1993, said in court on Monday that Mr. Miyazawa handed him a paper bag with three million yen, or $27,000 at current exchange rates, in cash on a visit to the prime minister's residence in 1991.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nakamura said that Mr. Miyazawa did not say what the money was for, but that he assumed that it was to silence his opposition to government efforts at the time to increase fines for violating Japanese antitrust laws. At the time, he was acting chairman of the governing party council, which was studying new antitrust laws.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nakamura also said in court that he believed he was later given the construction portfolio -- a powerful cabinet position because of the vast sums that Japan spends on public works -- because the governing Liberal Democratic Party hoped to keep the bribe secret. Mr. Nakamura, a member of the lower house of Parliament since 1976, was in Mr. Miyazawa's cabinet.</p>
        <p>He testified at hearings in an appellate court, where Mr. Nakamura is contesting a conviction on charges that he accepted 10 million yen in another bribery case.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miyazawa said today that the accusations were unfounded. ''I have no memory at all'' of the activities that Mr. Nakamura described, Mr. Miyazawa said. He called the charges ''wrong.''</p>
        <p>By the standards of Japanese political scandals, this one is minor. But Mr. Miyazawa's international stature is such that any hint that his tenure at finance minister may soon end has the potential to upset financial markets. Indeed, the fall of the yen against the dollar in early trading today was widely attributed in part to the brewing scandal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miyazawa has already told some party officials that he wants to leave his post at the Finance Ministry sometime after the coming election, which is widely expected to be called for June 25, according to party insiders. A spokesman for the Finance Ministry said he did not know the minister's plans.</p>
        <p>Mr. Miyazawa, 80, relinquished control of the party faction that he controlled in December 1998.</p>
