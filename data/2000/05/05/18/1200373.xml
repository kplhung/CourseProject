        <p>The Toyota Motor Corporation reported surprisingly strong financial results for the second half of its fiscal year today, helped by robust sales in North America and Japan and cost-cutting that partly offset the effects of a strong yen on profits made overseas.</p>
        <p>Toyota's earnings climbed 25 percent to 205.1 billion yen, or $1.9 billion at current exchange rates, in the last six months of the fiscal year that ended on March 31, compared with earnings of 163.5 billion yen in the corresponding period a year earlier.</p>

        <p>The Toyota Motor Corporation reported surprisingly strong financial results for the second half of its fiscal year today, helped by robust sales in North America and Japan and cost-cutting that partly offset the effects of a strong yen on profits made overseas.</p>
        <p>Toyota's earnings climbed 25 percent to 205.1 billion yen, or $1.9 billion at current exchange rates, in the last six months of the fiscal year that ended on March 31, compared with earnings of 163.5 billion yen in the corresponding period a year earlier.</p>
        <p>The increase at Toyota, Japan's largest car manufacturer and the world's fourth largest, was something of a testament to the company's cost-cutting programs -- savings that contributed $1.4 billion in operating profit during the last fiscal year.</p>
        <p>Toyota, maker of the best-selling Camry sedan and the Lexus line of luxury vehicles, also benefited from new models and the redesign of several old ones in its domestic Japanese market, like the new Estima minivan and its luxury model, the Crown. Two derivatives of a domestic small-car model, the Vitz, also sold briskly, and next week the company plans to introduce a new version of the Rav4 sport utility vehicle, which has also been popular here.</p>
        <p>Profits at several subsidiaries helped, too. The Daihatsu Motor Company, 51.1 percent of which is owned by Toyota, said on Tuesday that its net income quadrupled in the last fiscal year and that profit at smaller affiliates also soared.</p>
        <p>Koji Endo, an automotive analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in Tokyo, said: ''The outlook for Toyota is pretty positive. They have strong volume in the U.S. and in Japan, and with significantly more new products, both for Japan and outside, costs will continue to fall.''</p>
        <p>Despite this country's weak economy, Toyota forecast that domestic sales would rise 6.9 percent, to 1.83 million cars, this fiscal year. The Japanese auto market is enjoying a modest rebound; Goldman, Sachs estimates that domestic car registrations will rise at an annual rate of 6.4 percent over the next three years.</p>
        <p>With its new models and strong brand here -- Toyota's share of the Japanese market exceeded 42 percent in fiscal 1999 -- the company is well positioned for increasing demand. Its sales abroad helped compensate for the strong yen, which reduced earnings from sales made in foreign currencies.</p>
        <p>The yen's strength dealt a heavy blow to Toyota's competitor, the Honda Motor Company, which is heavily reliant on the United States market. Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, reported last Friday that earnings fell 14 percent in the recent fiscal year, a decline that had been expected. But on Tuesday, Honda startled investors with a forecast that overall profit this fiscal year would fall 27 percent, largely because of the strong yen's exchange-rate effect.</p>
        <p>Toyota's shares ended 2.6 percent lower today at 4,930 yen, or about $45, on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.</p>
