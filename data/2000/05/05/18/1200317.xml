        <p>AUSTIN HILL has become skilled at speaking for those hard-core computer programmers who spend their time making sure that no one -- not hackers nor marketers nor government investigators -- can pull aside the curtains cloaking their electronic domains. As president of Zero-Knowledge Systems, which builds privacy software, Mr. Hill has spoken at conferences around North America, espousing the credo that a person's online movements are no one else's business.</p>
        <p>So when he stood up last month at the Computers, Freedom and Privacy Conference in Toronto to kick off a low-budget ritual known as the Big Brother Awards, he was relaxed and smiling. Standing on a makeshift platform in a crowded lobby, he joked that his company had spent a million dollars to sponsor the event.</p>
        <p>Then he covered his mouth with an expression of mock horror and said, ''I hope our V.C.'s didn't hear that.''</p>
        <p>It was a telling moment. The mention of the million dollars was obviously a joke, but the reference to venture capitalists was not. Zero-Knowledge does indeed have a band of V.C.'s helping to bankroll its operations; it has received as much as $37 million in financing since October.</p>
        <p>Just five years ago, it seemed like a programmer's dream to think of making big money from cryptography, the field in which programs are developed to hide e-mail, shield online identities and lock up files. But today, abbreviations like V.C. and I.P.O., for initial public offering, are becoming as much a part of the language of secrecy as are three-letter federal agencies and code-locking keys.</p>
        <p>Privacy issues are becoming public concerns as Internet privacy is increasingly turning up on the evening news. More people are becoming aware of the vulnerability of their computer files because of things like hard-drive excavations by private and public investigators, who routinely dig through e-mail and other archives once thought to be far beyond the reach of any curious eyes.</p>
        <p>And entrepreneurs are betting that as soon as mainstream computer users realize their vulnerability, they will rush to sign up for privacy products.</p>
        <p>''It's becoming big business,'' said Lance Cottrell, president of Anonymizer.com, one of the first privacy services to let people surf the Web anonymously. ''I think that in the next five years, the majority of Internet users will be using some form of privacy-enhancing technology.''</p>
        <p>Companies are being started by all sorts of people, whether they have a background in computer code or not. But it is the emergence of high-profile, high-budget companies like Zero-Knowledge that signals a shift in the culture of cryptography.</p>
        <p>The quintessential encryption expert thrives in a shadowy world, writing code in obscurity for days on end. Several of these experts are suspicious of outsiders, including the press. Many of them champion individualism, deride big companies and dismiss anyone toeing the corporate line. The more familiar they are with the hacker underground, the more status they have.</p>
        <p>But now their software may just be something the masses will want. At the same time that the federal government is loosening restrictions on encryption technologies, building commercial products and cashing in on them (either through sales or advertising revenue) has become a viable option. And that means meshing two seemingly opposed ways of life, one based on advertising and corporate profits and another that prides itself on its insider culture and was founded on fervent beliefs in individual rights.</p>
        <p>For example, one of the companies, Hush Communications, got its start on the Caribbean island of Anguilla to avoid federal regulations on exporting encryption. Its co-founder, Cliff Blatzley, has a pierced tongue and has been known to work on projects for days without sleep. Another company, PrivacyX, was started by a Canadian named Wil Boucher, who describes himself as ''a bit on the paranoid side'' and once had a  Mohawk haircut that was dyed green and was six inches high.</p>
        <p>And Zero-Knowledge's chief scientist is Ian Goldberg, a computer expert who is well known among early Internet users for finding security holes in popular software. He goes by the title head cypherpunk (a label embraced by libertarian computer programmers) and leads a research group he calls the Evil Geniuses.</p>
        <p>Such irreverence may seem odd for people trying to attract mainstream users to their cause, but it may work to their advantage, just as a mass audience can be attracted to alternative-rock bands. The more these privacy companies snub corporate conventions, the more they may appear to be true crusaders against intrusive marketing companies.</p>
        <p>But can these companies maintain their underground image while engaging in the promotion that is required of most new tech companies these days? Can they continue to uphold the values of straight talk and consumer trust while focusing on profits and advertisers? Or, like some rock bands, will they be accused of selling out?</p>
        <p>Mr. Hill says they can. He equates his privacy company with start-ups like Netscape that emerged from Silicon Valley before dot-coms began to rule the Internet.  It was a different time, he said. ''It wasn't about, How do I get my new Porsche?'' Mr. Hill said. ''There was a culture about, How do we change the world?''</p>
        <p>Changing the world by building privacy software has not always been a simple business proposition. It used to require years of legal fights for the right to market the technology at all. Just ask Philip R. Zimmermann. In 1991, Mr. Zimmermann created a system called Pretty Good Privacy, which was distributed on the Internet and subsequently drew the ire of the United States government.</p>
        <p>P.G.P., as the system is now known, was designed to keep the contents of e-mail messages secret to everyone except their intended recipients. The technology is based on public-key cryptography, a technique that requires two related keys for messages to be opened. In simple terms, one key is used to lock the message, and the other is used to unlock it.</p>
        <p>In reality, however, the system is much more sophisticated. P.G.P. was considered so strong an encryption program that the United States government was considering whether to classify it as a munition that was not allowed outside the country. By 1993, the code behind P.G.P. had been posted on the Internet. Although Mr. Zimmermann maintained that he was not the person who posted it, he came under investigation by the United States attorney's office in San Jose, Calif., for possible prosecution for violating export laws. Federal officials argued that terrorists and other criminals could use the system to keep their plans secret, even from intelligence agencies.</p>
        <p>After three years, the government decided to drop the investigation. In the meantime, P.G.P. had become the encryption program of choice among longtime Internet users and technical wizards. It had also started to be adopted by people living under oppressive governments in countries where speaking freely in an unprotected e-mail message could mean a death sentence.</p>
        <p>''Today,'' Mr. Zimmermann said, ''P.G.P. is used by every human rights organization in the world.''</p>
        <p>Most people looking at Internet privacy now seem to be contending with problems that have little to do with government oppression. Instead, they want to avoid spam, direct-mail marketing, identity theft and the possibility that one of their e-mail messages might show up someday in a public courtroom. By using programs that encrypt their e-mail messages, people can send notes that can never be read by their employers or the wandering eyes of network administrators. Only the intended recipient of each message has the key to unlock the message.</p>
        <p>''Privacy is just that much more on people's minds these days,'' said John Gilmore, co-founder of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an Internet and civil rights group. People are starting to hear about friends who have had their Social Security numbers or credit card numbers stolen. Or they have read news reports about DoubleClick, an Internet advertising company that had planned to match data about people's surfing habits with information identifying the people involved.</p>
        <p>''The relentless advertising nature of so many of the commercial Internet companies is partly driving the public reaction,'' Mr. Gilmore said. ''People are saying, We don't want this.''</p>
        <p>To reach this new market, cryptographers are starting to realize that they must become less of an enigma to people. Zero-Knowledge, for example, has started posting essays under the heading Demystifying Cryptography on its Web site.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the companies are enjoying the kind of growth familiar to Internet start-ups, and the perks as well. Hush Communications, now based in Ireland, has doubled in size in the last few months to include more than 30 people. Anonymizer.com has an arcade game in its office, offers its employees unlimited soft drinks and will soon move into a larger office in downtown San Diego.  Zero-Knowledge has swelled to 200 employees; it is building a new office in Montreal with a massage room, a cappuccino stand, a rooftop terrace and free laundry services (a bonus to computer programmers who come from a culture that values smart code over personal hygiene).</p>
        <p>It doesn't quite feel the same as in the days when online privacy was the realm of the most paranoid and technically elite. The Computers, Freedom and Privacy Conference, which celebrated its 10th anniversary last month, used to attract an eclectic group of cryptographers, hackers, academics, privacy advocates and law enforcement officials. Many longtime attendees are now there on behalf of companies they have started or have been recruited to join. Not many meet the description of the lone cryptographer living hand-to-mouth, writing secret codes.</p>
        <p>''I think there are very few people like that left,'' said Mr. Boucher, of PrivacyX. ''I know some people who started out in the cypher underground, and most of them are now holding high-level positions in companies. And they are not complaining.''</p>
        <p>To make money, privacy-protection companies have two basic strategies: sell software and services or give away their products and sell advertising instead.</p>
        <p>The advertising model can be risky, but Anonymizer, PrivacyX and Hush Communications have arrangements with advertisers, and Zero-Knowledge has contracts in the works with online shops. Each one differs in how the advertisements appear, but all the companies assure their customers that no advertiser will ever know any personal information about them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gilmore, of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, would rather have people pay for privacy protection, preferably with micropayments (each a fraction of a cent) for each encrypted e-mail message, than accept the free products that come with advertising. ''Any company that is taking ads supposedly to protect your privacy is now serving two masters,'' Mr. Gilmore said. ''And ultimately they may have to choose between them at some point.'' A company might decide, for example, that the only way to stay afloat is to start divulging personal information about its users.</p>
        <p>Even without the double-edged sword of advertising, computer users with little technical expertise may have to trust that the products they are using are really secure. That puts privacy companies in a paradoxical position, said Mr. Cottrell, of Anonymizer. ''You are standing up and saying, 'You can't trust anyone,' '' he said. '' 'Come trust me.' ''</p>
        <p>Zero-Knowledge says that it has designed its system to sidestep that issue entirely.  The company has no way to retrieve any specific data on any of its users. It says it has built technical limitations into its software so that retrieval is impossible.</p>
        <p>Many companies have also published the code that lies behind their programs -- open-source code -- so that the programming can be reviewed by other technical experts. Among those that have open-source philosophies are Hush Communications, Zero-Knowledge, PrivacyX and Network Associates, which now owns the P.G.P. software.</p>
        <p>Meeting the technical expectations of the cryptography crowd while creating a simple product for consumers can be a challenge. Computer experts get a charge out of exposing security holes in systems that hold themselves up to be fail-safe and are constantly searching for signs of missteps.</p>
        <p>Last November, for example, Mr. Goldberg publicized a problem with PrivacyX's Web browser service. Mr. Boucher said the problem was with an early version (a beta release) of PrivacyX. ZipLip.com has been criticized in the cypherpunk community for not divulging the code behind its system. ZipLip.com says it uses well-established encryption systems and employs independent auditors to test its security.</p>
        <p>Generating serious interest among the general public in secret e-mail programs and anonymous-surfing tools is another hurdle. Despite news reports about privacy breaches, Mr. Hill said during a keynote address at the conference last month, there are still signs that people are more than willing to disclose personal information if tempted with a free personal computer. There are people, Mr. Hill said, who seem to have no problem asking, '' 'Will I get free McDonald's if I leave my DNA sample at the door?' ''</p>
        <p>''The education process is just starting,'' Mr. Hill said in an interview. He is convinced that such a drive to change the world can mix well with the need to make money. So far, he appears to be successful on both ends. He still wears the requisite black attire common to most cypherpunks; he still berates online companies for their privacy intrusions. And with the profit he made from his first start-up company, an Internet service provider, he bought a black Porsche 911, which sits in his garage during Montreal's winter months.</p>
        <p>''It's a fun toy,'' he said. ''I'm just taking it out this week.''</p>
        <p>Site-Seeing: Privacy Services</p>
        <p>Here are Web addresses for some of the many privacy services that let people shield their identities online or protect the contents of electronic messages.</p>
        <p>ANONYMIZER.COM: www.anonymizer.com  Offers free and subscription-based services that allow people to move around on the Internet or send e-mail without being traced.</p>
        <p>FREEDOM: www.freedom.net  This software from Zero-Knowledge Systems sells for $49.95. It lets people create pseudonyms to use while they chat or shop online, surf or send e-mail. The Freedom software uses encryption to hide the contents of information that travels over the Internet.</p>
        <p>HUSHMAIL: www.hushmail.com  From Hush Communications, this provides free, Web-based e-mail accounts that let people send encrypted messages. The messages can be opened only with a key, a code that is sent to the recipient -- and that key is locked up until the recipient uses a pass phrase to gain access to it. Both the sender and recipient must have HushMail accounts to use the service.</p>
        <p>PRETTY GOOD PRIVACY: www.pgp.com  This program, from Network Associates, offers free and fee-based security services for e-mail. To use the system, the sender must register for a pair of keys -- one is used to lock up, or encyrpt, messages and the other is used to unlock them. A recipient of a P.G.P. e-mail message must have one of the sender's keys to open the message. P.G.P. can be used alone or integrated into popular e-mail programs like Eudora.</p>
        <p>PRIVACYX: www.privacyx.com  Offers a free e-mail service that allows the sending of both anonymous and encrypted messages -- as long as you are using a Netscape or Microsoft e-mail system. To read messages sent through the PrivacyX system, recipients must have a digital certificate, a small, encrypted file that proves the identity of the recipient and sender and acts as a key by locking the message. Digital certificates can be obtained by signing up for a PrivacyX account.</p>
        <p>ZIPLIP.COM: www.ziplip.com  A service that provides free Web-based e-mail accounts (like those offered by HotMail) that let users send encrypted messages as well as regular e-mail. Recipients of the encrypted messages do not have to have ZipLip accounts. But they must enter a password -- which is agreed upon between the sender and receiver ahead of time -- to read the message.</p>
