        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As described in Alex Witchel's article, Betty Friedan's dismissal of the violence she experienced at the hands of her ex-husband deeply saddened me. Her views, similar to many prominent feminists', echo society's misconception that all abused women are weak, uneducated, self-destructive and powerless. Friedan's condemnation only adds to the shame that victims often feel. The truth is more complex than her stereotype. Many strong, smart women get into violent relationships and stay for reasons that have more to do with the manipulative powers of hope and love than low self-esteem.</p>
