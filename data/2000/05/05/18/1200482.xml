        <p>After receiving an offer from the Atlanta Hawks that seemed too good to refuse, Tom Izzo discussed it with his family, factored in reservations about the National Basketball Association travel schedule and personalities, then spoke with the Michigan State president, the news media and his team. Then he rejected the offer and decided to stay at Michigan State, which he guided to the National Collegiate Athletic Association title last month.</p>
        <p>Izzo was in Manhattan yesterday to receive the Winged Foot Award, given by the New York Athletic Club to the coaches of the men's and women's national championship teams. Izzo had only a few days to savor his team's defeat of Florida on April 4 when the Hawks called.</p>
        <p>In the end, he said, he felt he could have a greater impact on players ages 17 to 22.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't that I was afraid of the challenge,'' Izzo said. ''I didn't think I was fully prepared.''</p>
        <p>Izzo is now such a hot commodity that Al Green, the athletic club's president, was not sure he would be able to accept his award in person. The coach, however, tried to play down his new-found celebrity status.</p>
        <p>''I'm from Iron Mountain, Mich., a blue-collar town of hard-working people where there wasn't room for egos,'' he said. ''That's the way we kind of ran our team this year.''</p>
