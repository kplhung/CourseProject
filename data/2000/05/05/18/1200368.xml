        <p>Vodafone AirTouch P.L.C., the world's largest wireless telephone operator, will sell its 15 percent stake in the French telecommunications operator Cegetel to its French partner, Vivendi, the companies announced today.</p>
        <p>Vodafone's sale of the stake, which Vodafone saw as having little strategic value, gives Vivendi majority control of Cegetel, which controls the French wireless operator SFR.</p>
        <p>The sale does not mean Vodafone and Vivendi are reducing their friendly relationship. The closeness of that relationship became a critical reason for Vodafone's success in buying Mannesmann A. G., the German telecommunications conglomerate, in a record hostile takeover earlier this year.</p>
        <p>On the contrary, Vodafone and Vivendi announced a new joint venture today called Vizzavi, a European Internet portal accessible by mobile telephones, desktop computers and hand-held devices. They hope to sell Vizzavi shares to the public within two years.</p>
        <p>Vodafone and Vivendi became bedfellows in late January during  Vodafone's bid for Mannesmann.  The German company had been negotiating with Vivendi in hopes of thwarting Vodafone's bid, but at the last minute, Vivendi agreed to a surprise alliance with Vodafone, effectively guaranteeing Vodafone's successful takeover of Mannesmann.</p>
        <p>As part of Vodafone's alliance with Vivendi announced then, Vodafone said it would sell Vivendi half of Mannesmann's 15 percent stake in Cegetel if Vodafone acquired the German conglomerate. Today, Vodafone said it would sell the entire Cegetel stake to Vivendi.</p>
        <p>Vivendi already owns a 44 percent  stake in Cegetel; today's deal would bring that stake to 59 percent. Cegetel is also partly owned by British Telecommunications, which holds a 26 percent stake, and SBC Communications, which has 15 percent.</p>
        <p>Jeane-Marie Messier, chairman of Vivendi, said he would consider reselling the 15 percent stake purchased from Vodafone to the other partners or outside suitors.</p>
        <p>Even without its stake in Cegetel, Vodafone still has a direct investment stake in SFR.</p>
        <p>At a news conference in Paris, Chris Gent, Vodafone's chief executive, and Mr. Messier said they would open Vizzavi this summer across Europe in multiple languages.</p>
        <p>In a separate, unrelated announcement, Vivendi said it would drop out of the auction for the next-generation cellular license in Germany.</p>
