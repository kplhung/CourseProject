        <p>Let's face it. When it comes to providing high-level, high-suspense soap opera, the British royal family just hasn't been delivering lately. Will the Prince of Wales marry his mistress? Will the Duke and Duchess of York reunite? It's hard to care, frankly. But where is a person with an addiction to palace intrigue, power lust and sexual betrayal to look these days?</p>
        <p>As improbable as it may sound, you could start with ''Don Carlos,'' a work of Enlightenment idealism rendered with Sturm und Drang passion and convolutions in five very long acts by the 18th-century German playwright Friedrich Schiller. It is also a work, for the record, that few English-speaking companies have been so foolhardy as to tackle.</p>
        <p>Yet as streamlined for speed and maximum melodramatic punch, the ''Don Carlos'' currently in residence at the Harvey Theater of the Brooklyn Academy of Music is an answer to the prayers even of those suffering withdrawal pangs over the cancellation of ''Beverly Hills 90210.'' This smashingly soapy interpretation from the Royal Shakespeare Company, which runs through Saturday, may still weigh in at 3 hours 20 minutes, but it flies by like Errol Flynn in tights.</p>
        <p>This is not to trivialize the accomplishment of the show's director, Gale Edwards, who is also bizarrely responsible for the hit electronic blob on Broadway called ''Jesus Christ Superstar.'' Ms. Edwards brings out the Jacobean blood and thunder in Schiller, plus a nerve-straining sense of the corridors of power as minefields.</p>
        <p>The director is not shy in underscoring her intentions, coaxing perilously heightened performances from her very adroit cast members and punctuating moments of ominous revelation with bursts of music (by the composer Gary Yershon) that bear a suspicious resemblance to the watch-out organ chords that used to punctuate silent movies.</p>
        <p>Yet Ms. Edwards keeps such ingredients this side (if only just) of kitsch and camp, instead using them to create a feeling of truly living large, as do those breathing the rarefied and poisoned air of an Inquisition-era Spanish court, that of Philip II. This, after all, is a play in which political fortunes (specifically the fate of the Spanish-controlled Netherlands) hinge on the consequences of a crown prince's illicit love for his royal stepmother.</p>
        <p>The overblown declarations of Schillerian sentiment, vigorously translated by Robert David MacDonald, emerge naturally from this context, no small feat given a preponderance of lines like ''Your catastrophic curiosity/hastens on the fearfulest discovery/and when you make it, it will make you mad.''</p>
        <p>That modest fragment of conversation is spoken by the title character of ''Don Carlos,'' the 23-year-old heir to the throne and not exactly a paragon of restraint. Schiller created Carlos, who returns from the university to find things rotten in the state of Spain, as a homage to ''Hamlet.''</p>
        <p>But whereas the Prince of Denmark wound up being the most canny dissembler in a gallery of double-dealers, this Prince of Spain isn't mad just north by northwest. Well, mad is perhaps overstating it. Nonetheless, as portrayed by Rupert Penry-Jones in a flashy but exquisitely modulated performance that would seem to promise imminent stardom, Carlos is a creature of exasperating and delicious extremes.</p>
        <p>In a world in which playing your cards close to your chest is essential to survival, this fellow has his dangling from his flapping, uncuffed French sleeves. When he's up, his arms stretch for the heavens; when he's down, he is most likely to be sprawling on the floor. And he segues from one to the other in something less than a second.</p>
        <p>This isn't mere pyrotechnics. Mr. Penry-Jones presents Carlos as the unbalanced product of a royal education that both indulged him lavishly and denied him cruelly. Carlos, after all, didn't even meet his father until he was 6, and on that day the king was signing death warrants. And once we actually encounter Philip in this production, we see just how much the father is the key to the son's character and vice versa.</p>
        <p>Philip is played by John Woodvine, an estimable veteran of the London theater and the reason here that Mr. Penry-Jones doesn't hijack ''Don Carlos.'' Mr. Woodvine's Philip is clearly what Carlos could become after a few decades in the corset of absolute power. (The costume designer, Sue Wilmington, plays wittily on this idea, contrasting Philip's closely buttoned Stalinesque tunic with the flowing ''Young Werther''-style dishabille of Carlos.)</p>
        <p>Moving among his courtiers as though with a built-in alarm system ready to go off at the merest breath of insubordination, Mr. Woodvine's Philip is a terror, suggesting Carlos's unlimited energies trapped in a tightly capped bottle. As scary as Philip is at his most rigid, growling his displeasure in the voice of a dybbuk, that's nothing compared to what happens when he descends into full-blown paranoia, bringing to mind the jealousy-demented Leontes of ''A Winter's Tale.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Woodvine's performance, like that of Mr. Penry-Jones, is brazenly big and almost always works. The same might be said of the production in general, even if its purposes arguably aren't always those of Schiller. Peter J. Davison's high-walled multipurpose set, which is ingeniously defined from scene to scene by Mark McCullough's hallways of light, is a wonderfully forbidding fascist power temple. You never fail to understand why everyone in this production is always looking over his or her shoulder.</p>
        <p>The most alluring set of shoulders belongs to Josette Simon, who commandingly plays Elizabeth of Valois, Philip's French queen and the beloved of the unfortunate Carlos, as a spirit of fire in an oxygen-free environment. Claire Price is appropriately hot and cold by turns as her conscience-stricken handmaiden and rival.</p>
        <p>And the supporting cast offers a vivid assortment of studies in anxious statesmanship that bring to mind sketches by Holbein. One thinks particularly of Geoffrey Whitehead's ambitious priest, with his nervous gaze and clinched, cautious speech.</p>
        <p>The role of the Marquis of Posa (Ray Fearon), Carlos's best friend and Schiller's anachronistic example of the Enlightenment hero, has been scaled down. Mr. Fearon is fine but used more as a balancing force of stability than a sparkling font of high-minded inspiration.</p>
        <p>It should be pointed out that the marquis is responsible for some elaborate late additions to the story, involving arcane political counterplots, that are nearly impossible to follow. Don't even try, and don't worry. Just hold out for the evening's penultimate scene in which the ancient Grand Inquisitor (John Rogan in a superbly incisive quick sketch) finally makes his appearance, providing the last, damning word on the warping effects of playing God.</p>
        <p>The evening's temperature, which has been in the fever regions, suddenly drops precipitously. And this galloping show ends, quite appropriately, with a Grand Guignol shiver.</p>
