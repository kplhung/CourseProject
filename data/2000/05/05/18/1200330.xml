        <p>''TREES. I would like to add trees,'' reads the legend on a simple map of a street in Paterson, N.J., drawn in colored pencil by a freshman high school student, Leon White, who lives on it. Green trees have been swirled onto the black and white street like the rotations of a wand.</p>
        <p>Urban solutions can be this simple -- so simple, in fact, that a child can create them.</p>
        <p>Through an ambitious plan called the City of Learning, Paterson, a city of 170,000, is giving public high school students not only the tools to understand its urban problems, but also the chance to solve them.</p>
        <p>Leon White is enrolled at the Metro Paterson Academy for Communications and Technology, or Mpact, a new public school established in September in an empty downtown mall, where open-classroom walls are papered with student projects: urban renewal studies and school construction proposals.</p>
        <p>Mpact is a pilot in a program of innovative academies that offer specialized curricula and smaller classes. Started by Manhattan's Center for Innovative Education, they are being tested in other cities. In Paterson, the academies are also being proposed as tools for urban renewal in an economically distressed city with a school performance so poor that the district was taken over by the state in 1991.</p>
        <p>Anticipating $500 million to $800 million in state money to build new school facilities, Dr. Edwin Duroy, the state-appointed superintendent of schools, realized that improving schools was meaningless if the struggling city was ignored. His budget represented Paterson's largest potential capital investment. Why not use it to rescue the schools and try rehabilitating the city at the same time? And put students at the center of the  equation by teaching them city planning -- at school.</p>
        <p>The opportunity demanded vision. Dr. Duroy invited urban designers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with experience in school districts from Berkeley, Calif., to Washington, D.C., to develop a master plan for Paterson's schools and its 25,000 students.</p>
        <p>The New American School Design Project, a workshop of graduate students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology led by Roy Strickland, an architect, developed a concept called the City of Learning -- an expanding system of academies throughout Paterson that would spark investment in neighborhoods, especially a sorely vacant, turn-of-the-century downtown.</p>
        <p>By September, seven academies will be in operation.</p>
        <p>In an election year, when the nature of education and the fate of cities are being debated at a national level, Paterson is putting the American high school on Main Street. Mpact is at number 175. At the school, which opened last September with a freshman class of 25, students study college preparatory subjects like mathematics and history in the morning and technology, entrepreneurship  and urban planning in the afternoon. It is an extended day, ending at 4 p.m. Visited recently, students were still working at 6.</p>
        <p>Posted in the classroom where urban planning is taught is a list of ''Existing Conditions'' in Paterson,  identified by students. They include ''railroad tracks,'' ''crackheads,'' ''parking lots,'' ''lost treasures'' and ''discarded clothing'': a stream of consciousness from its younger citizens that runs like the Passaic River and its treacherous falls, through the heart of the city.</p>
        <p>''We live here; nobody knows it better than us,'' Kemesha Pringle, 14, said.</p>
        <p>Her classmate, Maurice Moore, 14, said, ''Now, we've got a responsibility to give people what they want.''</p>
        <p>On June 14, the class will present its first proposal to the Board of Education: a plan to replace a faculty parking lot between two schools with an educational park for the community. Their proposals include a food court (the children complained about the cafeteria lunch), a swimming pool (the community asked for it), an arcade for games after school and a tent for reading during the summer -- improvements to school property that a school budget theoretically would pay for.</p>
        <p>Javier Mendez, 15, said that his work improving Paterson with planning was important because ''it's my home.''</p>
        <p>In ''stepping outside the box,'' as Dr. Duroy called beyond-the-classroom steps like Mpact and the City of Learning, Paterson hopes to move toward smaller, more personal learning environments, which are now widely acknowledged as improving performance. Paterson hopes smaller classes will combat the dropout rate, which exceeded 15 percent in the 1998-99 school year. The state average was 2.9 percent.</p>
        <p>''Many eighth graders choose not to go to the high schools, but to vocational schools,'' Dr. Duroy said. ''Recognizing this, I felt we needed to become competitive. We needed to bring alternative choices to parents.''</p>
        <p>The academies are being created to compete. Applications to Mpact, which is choosing its second freshman class of 25 now, have doubled because of word-of-mouth between parents.</p>
        <p>The anticipated budget is Paterson's share of a 1998 New Jersey Supreme Court decision requiring the state to dedicate billions of dollars to school construction in 28 low-income districts.</p>
        <p>The New Jersey Senate will vote today on a proposal to put the Economic Development Agency in charge of school construction, a plan that Gov. Christine Todd Whitman supports, said Gregg Edwards, executive director of the Senate.</p>
        <p>''The sponsors of the bill want towns to think creatively about what school money can be used to do, and that's just what Paterson is talking about,'' he said. ''Paterson is looking at the money as part of an economic development strategy. The Economic Development Agency will be more sympathetic to the sort of things Paterson wants to do.''</p>
        <p>But James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, questioned the ability of schools to act as economic engines in a city.</p>
        <p>''I'm trying to think of what they'll achieve beyond bailing out property owners,'' he said, explaining that putting schools in vacant, downtown buildings was not the invitation to commercial development that placing businesses would be. And, he added, ''there's not that much buying power to support retail facilities.''</p>
        <p>Tom Lonreghan, executive director of the Special Improvement District in Paterson, a coalition of local businesses and property owners, said of the academies' new downtown: ''We do feel the schools have had a positive impact -- the added presence of hundreds of students and teachers. But as for bringing in higher-end business like Starbucks, I haven't seen that impact.''</p>
        <p>Will Paterson take its student planners seriously?</p>
        <p>Partnerships with institutions like M.I.T. and Lucent Technologies, which is working with Stephen Cohen, the school district's technology planner, to wire the City of Learning with Internet-access cable for every school in Paterson, has gotten the city's attention.</p>
        <p>''That these are ideas being generated by kids doesn't undermine the fact that they are bright ideas that have merit,'' said William McKoy, president of the Board of Education, who was elected to the Paterson City Council last week on a platform promoting Paterson as the City of Learning.</p>
        <p>''They're training and thinking with good institutions,'' he said. ''The collaboration is meaningful to the city -- it's not Monopoly.''</p>
        <p>At Mpact, the students have already developed their own mass-transit system: rolling desk chairs that speed them from desk to desk, across the plaza of the classroom, to confer on projects. The plan for the laboratory is a Socratic circle; there are no rows or lecterns.</p>
        <p>Jean Riesman, an instructor with an M.I.T. master's degree in city planning, is developing Mpact's first year of programs, which include  working with the class on converting a municipal parking lot into a civic center and park, with schools, malls and a transportation hub for a proposed light-rail link to New York.</p>
        <p>Like any planning session, the discussion, chaired by Ms. Riesman, a woman in black jeans and wide-heeled boots with a salt-and-pepper ponytail, came down to what Paterson had, what it didn't have and what it could have as a place to live.</p>
        <p>''Everybody wanted stores,'' LaToya Matthews, 14, said. ''Old Navy, Gap. But then we had to stop and think: That's going to take away business from the stores that are here. We don't want to put them out of business. So there had to be some sort of collaboration.''</p>
        <p>Marilyn Medina, 15, said that she thought people living downtown would encourage businesses to open.</p>
        <p>''You see the building across the street?'' she asked, turning to the classroom window behind her. Above an open store, the building was empty. ''There's just a bunch of junk in there. We would like to turn the old buildings into apartments, because there are a lot of apartments needed in Paterson, with more living space.''</p>
        <p>Ruth Melecio, 15, qualified the idea. ''Not change the outside, just the inside,'' she said. ''We have some really nice buildings. We want to keep those in Paterson, so it's not like everywhere else.''</p>
        <p>As a group, the students agreed that there should be recreational facilities and entertainment at the city-center site, which are lacking now.</p>
        <p>''Not only for us, but for younger kids growing up, too,'' Kemesha Pringle said. ''We're trying to change things so that they could have a better life or experience different things that aren't here.''</p>
        <p>Ruth Melecio interviewed her family. ''I asked my mom what she thinks would go nicely downtown,'' Ms. Melecio said. ''She said, 'Oh, a movie theater, a bowling alley.' I brought that in, and everyone said, 'Oh yeah, I didn't think about that.' ''</p>
        <p>With no theater of its own, Paterson moviegoers travel to Passaic and Clifton.</p>
        <p>More citizen than city official, Leon White, 14, proposed the obvious.</p>
        <p>''All the movie theaters that aren't being used, that are just collecting dust,'' he said, speaking of several shuttered theaters downtown, ''maybe they should try reopening them.''</p>
        <p>LaToya Matthews added: ''When a movie comes out, everybody talks about going that Saturday night. Why can't they go in their own town?'' She also advocated a skating rink. ''When a D.J. from Paterson wants to throw a party, we have to go all the way to Wayne,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Maurice Moore, 14, made an observation that could help him in an election, if he pursues his participation in the city. ''If we had all this stuff that we want,'' he said, ''it would be stuff that would attract tourism. People would come in, spend money and leave.''</p>
        <p>The adults led the class in appreciative laughter.</p>
