        <p>Any good marketer knows that one of the keys to a product's success is to extend the brand name into new areas. America Online has lots of good marketers (witness those 250-hours-free CD's, the stuff of junk-mail legend), so it comes as little surprise that AOL is now extending its brand name into schools.</p>
        <p>With AOL@School (www.school.aol.com), which began operating this week, America Online is offering schools an easy gateway to the Internet, similar to what Electric SchoolHouse, the Copernicus Education Gateway and others have done. AOL's service consists of six portals, four for students (grouped by grade, from kindergarten through high school), one for teachers and one for administrators. All are available no matter what Internet service provider is used, and will also be available from home.</p>

America Online has lots of good marketers (witness those 250-hours-free CD's, the stuff of junk-mail legend), so it comes as little surprise that AOL is now extending its brand name into schools.</p>
        <p>With AOL@School (www.school.aol.com), which began operating this week, America Online is offering schools an easy gateway to the Internet, similar to what Electric SchoolHouse, the Copernicus Education Gateway and others have done. AOL's service consists of six portals, four for students (grouped by grade, from kindergarten through high school), one for teachers and one for administrators. All are available no matter what Internet service provider is used, and will also be available from home.</p>
        <p>The student portals contain links to educational sites that have been approved by a group of educators selected by AOL and the American Association of School Administrators, including Compton's Encyclopedia, the Smithsonian Institution and The New York Times Learning Network. The portals also offer several controls on access: a search engine filters out inappropriate sites, and access to chat, e-mail and instant messaging can be restricted by school administrators.</p>
        <p>The service is free, and there will be no advertising on student portals, the company says. The teachers' and administrators' portals, however, will have ''sponsorship messages,'' AOL says, as well as an e-commerce component so schools can stock up on old-fashioned things like chalk and erasers.</p>
