        <p>Defending its plan to break up the Microsoft Corporation, the government filed documents with a federal judge tonight that disparaged Microsoft's alternative proposal as ''a cosmetic remedy that would have virtually no competitive significance.''</p>
        <p>The brief, from the Justice Department and 17 state attorneys general, is the last written filing in the case before penalty hearings begin on Wednesday. It is a response to the brief Microsoft filed last week, in which the company proposed several narrow restrictions on its conduct that it said would be more appropriate penalties than breaking up the company.</p>
        <p>But the government's brief said that Microsoft's proposal ''does not address some of the most important violations found by the court,'' including a declaration that the company had illegally linked its Web browser to the Windows operating system.</p>
        <p>The document also belittled Microsoft's contention that interaction between its product groups was crucial for continued innovation. It cited several recent instances when company leaders, including its co-founder and chairman, William H. Gates, said the opposite -- that clear divisions between groups was important for the company's success.</p>
        <p>In response, Microsoft said, ''The government filing is long on rhetoric but short on economic analysis or factual support for its overreaching proposals.''</p>
        <p>On April 3, United States District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that Microsoft was in wide violation of federal and state antitrust laws, and a few days later he told lawyers for both sides that he wanted to complete the penalty phase of the case quickly -- preferably within 60 days.</p>
        <p>Then, on April 20, the federal and state governments proposed breaking Microsoft in two and imposing restrictions on the company's conduct while the breakup was being carried out. Two states, Illinois and Ohio, declined to go along with the others, saying a breakup was too extreme a remedy.</p>
        <p>Under the government plan, one company would hold the Windows operating system and the other would group everything else, including the Office package of applications programs that includes Word and the spreadsheet program Excel.</p>
        <p>In its brief last week, Microsoft denounced the idea of a breakup and said that ''cross-pollination between engineers working on different products such as Windows and Office has led to numerous innovations.''</p>
        <p>But today's government brief says, ''The story Microsoft now tells of dependency between the operating systems and applications is, at the very least, greatly exaggerated.'' It goes on to quote company leaders who appear to support that assertion.</p>
        <p>In an e-mail message last year in which two company executives, Ben Slivka and Brad Silverberg, were discussing a forthcoming corporate reorganization, Mr. Silverberg wrote that Steven A. Ballmer, Microsoft's president, ''needs to do something so that the company ends up with an organization that essentially is a separate company within the company.''</p>
        <p>''It has to be free to do what it thinks best'' he continued, because ''the company is so wrapped up in its shorts that it can't get anything done.''</p>
        <p>The brief also quotes from a 1996 book ''Microsoft Secrets'' by Michael A. Cusumano and Richard W. Shelby, saying, ''Bill Gates insisted to us that Microsoft's 'dominant organizational theme is by products,' '' adding that Mr. Gates wanted ''product architectures that reduce interdependencies among teams.''</p>
        <p>The brief also quotes from another 1996 book, ''The Microsoft Way'' by Randall E. Stross, in which managers are quoted as saying, ''Whenever they studied the patterns of actual face-to-face communications'' between developer groups, ''they invariably discovered that developers never seemed to venture more than a few feet from their own offices. The daily cross-fertilization of ideas among groups was not evident.''</p>
        <p>In an online column the same year, quoted in the brief, Mr. Gates wrote: ''I gain confidence about a potential reorganization when I see that it makes clear what every group is supposed to do'' and ''minimizes the dependencies and overlap between groups.''</p>
        <p>Microsoft's spokesman, Mark Murray, said the government was referring to ''a handful of Microsoft statements talking about the need for clear lines of authority in an American business.'' He added that the government was ''euphomistically calling the unprecedented break up proposal merely a reorganization.''</p>
        <p>Over all, the government said, Microsoft's objections to its remedy proposal are ''unfounded and based almost entirely on tortured readings and mischaracterizations of the language of the proposed remedy.''</p>
        <p>In several places, the brief says, Microsoft objected to a portion of the government's proposed remedy while failing to mention another portion that addressed the company's concern.</p>
        <p>Microsoft, in its brief filed last week, insisted that it would need six months to prepare for penalty hearings, should the judge decide to consider the government's breakup plan.</p>
        <p>That would push the end of the trial well into the next presidential administration. And though Microsoft denies it, many analysts say they think the company hopes a Republican administration will drop the breakup idea. The presumed G.O.P. nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, has already suggested that he opposes a breakup of the company.</p>
        <p>In its brief today, the government said the penalty phase could be concluded quickly, and called Microsoft's proposed schedule ''a transparent effort to delay the determination and implementation of a remedy for its illegal acts as long as possible.''</p>
        <p>The brief does not offer a specific alternate timetable, but government officials have said the remedy phase could be completed within a few weeks and the company's request ''for substantial delays should be denied.''</p>
