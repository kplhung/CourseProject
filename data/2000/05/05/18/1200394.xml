        <p>In a draft of a long-awaited report on the health effects of the pollutant dioxin, scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency say the chemical is 10 times more likely to cause cancer than previously estimated. Some environmental groups hailed the draft, but some scientists questioned its assertions.</p>
        <p>People with the highest exposures to dioxin -- those who are older and eat fatty foods -- may have a 1 in 100 chance of getting cancer from the dioxin in their bodies, the report says. Moreover, it says, the chemical can cause other adverse health effects, like developmental delays in children and disruptions in hormone secretions.</p>
        <p>The agency said the report was still being written, and its conclusions has not been distributed to an E.P.A. scientific advisory board. In fact, a board to evaluate the report is only now being put together.</p>
        <p>Some scientists said they doubted that the report's conclusions would stand up to a board's scrutiny, and a few were scathing in their assessment, with one expert in clinical toxicology calling the report ''an embarrassment.''</p>
        <p>The conclusions of the draft report, but not the need for the advisory board review, were described on Wednesday in The Washington Post, sending industry groups and environmentalists scrambling to respond to a document that few had seen.</p>
        <p>The report is a revision of one the agency submitted for assessment by its advisory board in 1994. The board questioned the conclusions about dioxin's health effects and asked the agency to repeat its work. The draft is the result of that work.</p>
        <p>Staff members at the environmental agency said the new report's conclusions were based on scientific evidence that had emerged in recent years.</p>
        <p>A scientist for the agency said the E.P.A. was not responding to most calls from reporters on the draft report, but he agreed to speak on the condition of anonymity. He said the data came from the agency's interpretation of studies in Dutch children showing that dioxin might alter development and that it might affect thyroid hormone secretions; studies of a group of men called the Ranch Hands, who flew planes for the Air Force in Vietnam and were exposed to dioxin while spraying the herbicide Agent Orange; and from studies of industrial workers.</p>
        <p>But, the scientist said, while the cancer risk of dioxin might be much greater than previously estimated, Americans were now exposed to less of the pollutant.</p>
        <p>Dioxin is formed, for example, when chlorine-containing chemicals, like plastics or industrial wastes, are burned, or when pulp and paper are bleached. The chemical can waft through the air or be carried in dust, settling on plants that are eaten by animals. Once ingested, dioxin accumulates in the fat. When humans eat the animals, or when they consume dairy products having fat, like milk, dioxin enters their bodies, where it remains, stored in fat.</p>
        <p>Since the 1970's, however, pollution controls have caused dioxin levels in the environment to drop. As a result, people now have less dioxin in their bodies.</p>
        <p>The agency scientist said that even though many foods contained dioxin, the food supply was safe. Though dioxin gets into breast milk, he said, the benefits of breast feeding far exceed the risks from dioxin.</p>
        <p>The E.P.A.'s conclusions on dioxin are being met with vigorous responses from industry and from environmentalists.</p>
        <p>''The E.P.A. has a real dilemma,'' said Dr. Marcie Francis, senior director of science policy at the Chlorine Chemistry Council, an industry group. ''If the food supply is safe and yet at the same time dioxin is causing cancer, it's a real contradiction.''</p>
        <p>Rick Hind, legislative director of the Toxics Campaign by the environmental group Greenpeace, said the agency did not go far enough. A pesticide would be banned if its cancer risk was 1 in 1,000,000, Mr. Hind said, and so why did the agency tolerate dioxin, with a cancer risk of 1 in 100?</p>
        <p>''They prefer,'' he said, ''to look largely at the endpoints -- what some call 'blame the victim.' Don't burn trash in your backyard. Eat a low-fat diet. That's not enough.''</p>
        <p>The Toxics Campaign wants a ban on chlorine compounds used in manufacturing, like polyvinyl chloride in plastics.</p>
        <p>Some scientists who had reviewed the E.P.A.'s previous dioxin report were skeptical of the new analysis.</p>
        <p>Dr. Morton Lippmann, a professor of environmental medicine at the New York University School of Medicine, was head of the agency's advisory board in 1994 and has agreed to head the board being put together now. Dr. Lippmann said that while he had not seen the new draft report, scientific research on dioxin since 1994 ''has been less than definitive.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Michael Gough, a retired biologist who was on the agency's advisory board in 1994 and headed a panel that evaluated the Ranch Hands data for the Department of Health and Human Services, said there was no reason to believe that the risk of getting cancer from dioxin was higher than had been thought.</p>
        <p>''There has been no epidemiological study in the last five years -- since their last assessment -- that makes that claim any more credible,'' Dr. Gough said.</p>
        <p>Dr. John Doull, a clinical toxicologist at the University of Kansas in Kansas City, also was a member of the advisory board that reviewed the previous dioxin report. He said the agency seemed to have disregarded his group's advice.</p>
        <p>''Their review of the critical dioxin literature is inadequate and their recommendations appear to me to be unsupported and arrogant,'' Dr. Doull said. ''This action appears to be ill-timed, political rather than scientific and is an embarrassment to science and certainly to toxicology.''</p>
