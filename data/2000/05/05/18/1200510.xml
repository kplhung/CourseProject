        <p>SHIELDS-Walker E., Sr. Died peacefully at age 93 on May 8, 2000 in Palm Beach, Fl. Dorothy Henderson Shields, his wife since 1988, also a resident of Palm Beach for many years, died on March 22, 2000. Miriam Stevenson Shields, his wife of 50 years and mother of his son, Walker E.

Mr. Shields, Sr. was born in 1906, grew up in Rock Island, IL., went to Saint John's Military Academy, Deerfield Academy, and then graduated from Bowdoin College during the years of the Great Depression. He began work for the City Bank of New York in 1931 and was involved in commercial banking in Manhattan for forty years, during most of which time he lived in Greenwich CT. At the time of his retirement from Citibank in 1971, while working in the branch at Lexington and 42nd Street, he served as Senior Vice President. Subsequently he continued in banking and financial consultation in Palm Beach, FL. for many years. As a result of his college experiences at Bowdoin, Mr. Shields communicated great fondness for Maine. The family frequently enjoyed trips together to the Belgrade Lakes Region, to the Maine Coast near Brunswick and also to the homes Mr. Shields Sr shared with his wife Miriam in Connecticut and Florida. A family burial service will be held in Lincolnville, ME. In lieu of flowers, please make memorial contributions to Bowdoin College, Brunswick, ME.</p>
