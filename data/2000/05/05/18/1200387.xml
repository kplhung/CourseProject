        <p>Late in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals on Sunday, a fan wearing a Philadelphia Flyers jersey began pummeling a fan wearing a Devils jersey in the seats of the First Union Center in Philadelphia.

        <p>The people who run the arena issued stern warnings for the next two days that such things are forbidden and would result in swift punishment. They said so in news releases, on the scoreboard and on cards passed out to ticket holders entering the arena for Game 2 on Tuesday.</p>

        <p>Late in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference finals on Sunday, a fan wearing a Philadelphia Flyers jersey began pummeling a fan wearing a Devils jersey in the seats of the First Union Center in Philadelphia. Although the Devils were on their way to a 4-1 victory, the Philadelphia spectators cheered. It was the wildest of several fights among fans.</p>
        <p>The people who run the arena issued stern warnings for the next two days that such things are forbidden and would result in swift punishment. They said so in news releases, on the scoreboard and on cards passed out to ticket holders entering the arena for Game 2 on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>But the nonverbal message had already been delivered. In Game 2, a 4-3 Flyers victory, the rough stuff increased, but it stayed on the icy side of the glass, among the athletes. There were lots of cheap shots, a couple of bloody cuts, a few exchanges of nasty words, one double-spearing incident, a fist fight between two big forwards and a concussion from a thundering body check. Remarkably, two referees called a total of only 26 penalty minutes. Although the Devils dished out as much as they absorbed, the style favored the Flyers, who evened the four-of-seven-game series at one victory apiece.</p>
        <p>With Game 3 in the Meadowlands tonight, it is hoped by most that there will be no retaliation from spectators representing the northern end of the road in this Battle of the Turnpike. As for players, the Flyers hope things continue just as they are.</p>
        <p>''If that's what it's going to take for us to win, we're going to have to bear down and stick together,'' said Dan McGillis, a Flyers defenseman. ''I definitely think the refs were letting us play it out there. It's good to see. It's good to watch. It's good, clean hockey. That's what the game's all about. It's nice to play it like that.''</p>
        <p>Late in the game on Tuesday, McGillis hit Sergei Brylin not once but twice from behind in succession and rapped his head into the boards. This knocked off Brylin's helmet and opened a cut above Brylin's right eye. He showed it to the officials, who shrugged it off. Afterward, McGillis suggested that Brylin might have cut himself on his own helmet visor. When this was relayed to Brylin, he wrinkled his nose as if a sudden, sour odor had entered the room.</p>
        <p>This is not to suggest that the Devils are all passive victims. Randy McKay, the veteran right wing, got the best of Keith Primeau when the Flyers' recent concussion victim challenged McKay to fight. This was before Scott Stevens, the Devils' captain, put Philadelphia's Daymond Langkow out of the game with a hard shoulder check that left Langkow with a cut and a concussion.</p>
        <p>Primeau got even later by putting New Jersey's John Madden out of the game with a knee-to-knee hit that left Madden writhing in pain and limping out of the building. And Stevens responded to that by upending Primeau with a low check in the knee area and glowering down at him.</p>
        <p>While some of this is inevitable in the playoffs, Stevens expressed concern about his teammates being drawn into too many post-whistle scrums, with pushing and pulling and gloves rubbing across faces.</p>
        <p>''Philly's a dump-and-grind team, let's not kid ourselves,'' Stevens said. ''At times, we lost our focus, getting into scuffles and stuff like that, which is uncharacteristic of our team.'' This hurts the deeper Devils, Stevens said, who ''use more people'' than the Flyers.</p>
        <p>''It is to their advantage if there's a scrum and a delay of game,'' Stevens said, referring to the Flyers. ''We want to keep the game rolling. It's more beneficial to us.''</p>
        <p>Stevens's counterpart, the Philadelphia captain Eric Desjardins, is also a veteran defenseman. He agreed. ''We're that kind of team,'' Desjardins said. ''We like to play physical. It's our style.''</p>
        <p>Larry Robinson, the coach of the Devils, said: ''You get tired of getting elbowed in the head and punched in the face. We just have to get away from it and let the officials do their job.''</p>
        <p>Among the Flyers' best scrummers is Rick Tocchet, who scored twice and speared Claude Lemieux. ''We've got to stay in their face,'' Tocchet said.</p>
        <p>Referring specifically to Lemieux, Tocchet said: ''Lemieux's going to be yapping. I just yap back at him.''</p>
        <p>Of Game 3, Tocchet predicted: ''They're not going to come out and try to hammer us. They're going to play disciplined.''</p>
        <p>If the Devils do not, that would please Keith Jones, another agitator among the Philly forwards. ''Good, clean hockey,'' Jones said of Game 2, echoing McGillis. ''It was a big win for us. Where it takes us, we'll find out. When you win those games, it can really carry over. It was a fantastic win for us, the type of victory that can carry you through a series.''</p>
        <p>Like many Flyers, he praised Primeau for picking a fight despite a recent concussion, calling him a ''warrior.'' Primeau, who assisted on one of Tocchet's goals, said: ''We kind of settled more into our style. I didn't want to come off the ice. I wanted to stay out there. These games are so much fun. That's old-time playoff hockey. It doesn't get any better than that.''</p>
