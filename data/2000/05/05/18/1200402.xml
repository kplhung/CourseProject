        <p>As a Democratic candidate for New Jersey's United States Senate seat, Jon S. Corzine has proposed one of the most liberal agendas of any mainstream candidate in the nation.</p>
        <p>But in the closing weeks of the campaign, Mr. Corzine's business record as a former chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company has forced him into a position where few Democrats, and even fewer liberals, venture: defending gun manufacturers.</p>
        <p>In recent days, his opponent, Jim Florio, has begun new attacks on Mr. Corzine's record as co-chairman of Goldman Sachs, charging that the investment bank tried to help the parent company of Remington Arms Company in a merger deal in 1998.</p>
        <p>When potential merger partners were scared away by a lawsuit stemming from a school shooting in Jonesboro, Ark., Mr. Florio said, Goldman Sachs helped Remington devise a strategy ''to grow the company.''</p>
        <p>''During the '90's, when Jon, at Goldman Sachs, was financing the gun industry, I was standing up to the gun lobby, being able to shut down the sale and possession of assault weapons here in the state of New Jersey,'' Mr. Florio said during Tuesday's debate in Livingston, N.J.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine did not respond to the accusation when Mr. Florio first raised it during a debate last Thursday. But when the issue resurfaced on Tuesday, Mr. Corzine defended the gun companies as socially responsible businesses.</p>
        <p>''I hope the governor isn't suggesting that we have a ban on guns,'' Mr. Corzine said, ''or is he suggesting that Smith &amp; Wesson and Remington, who sell guns to our law enforcement officials, who sell guns to our military operations, legally, are somehow operating outside the law?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine also said that Smith &amp; Wesson recently agreed to restrictions in the way it made, sold and distributed handguns and agreed to try to develop so-called smart-gun technology to prevent guns from being fired by anyone other than their owners.</p>
        <p>The remarks, which come as President Clinton and elected officials around the country have threatened to sue companies for failing to take adequate safety precautions in the manufacture and distribution of guns, appear to put Mr. Corzine at odds with many members of his party.</p>
        <p>They also contradict Mr. Corzine's campaign platform, which advocates far stricter gun control proposals than do Mr. Florio or most current members of Congress.</p>
        <p>The squabble over Mr. Corzine's business associations with Remington and Smith &amp; Wesson, which is likely to continue until the June 6 primary, is Mr. Florio's latest attempt to use Mr. Corzine's business dealings to raise questions about his commitment to traditional Democratic social causes.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Florio's previous broadsides -- about Goldman Sachs's role in corporate mergers that eliminated jobs and an oil pipeline deal that enriched the repressive government of Sudan -- did not seem to resonate with the public, most polls show that New Jersey Democrats are concerned about gun control.</p>
        <p>Even one of the Republican candidates for the Senate, William L. Gormley, reminds voters that the National Rifle Association is still angry that he supported Mr. Florio's assault weapons ban in 1990.</p>
        <p>Some gun rights advocates said today that they were pleasantly surprised by Mr. Corzine's words of support.</p>
        <p>''Maybe he forgot he's supposed to be politically correct,'' said Nancy Ross, a spokeswoman for the Association of New Jersey Rifle and Pistol Clubs. ''And maybe he'll join us in opposing the smart gun legislation in the State Senate.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine tried to back away from his Tuesday statement today, explaining that he meant to defend Goldman Sachs's involvement with gun companies rather than the companies themselves.</p>
        <p>In a telephone interview, Mr. Corzine said he was not involved with, or aware of, Goldman Sachs's dealings with either Remington or Smith &amp; Wesson. If he had been involved in the decision and known of the charges against Remington, Mr. Corzine said, he would have spoken out against the deal. ''I would have advocated not being involved with underwriting the company,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Corzine also reiterated his contention that weapons manufacturers serve a purpose.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes, these places are responsible citizens for other functions in society,'' he said. ''We do want our law enforcement officials to have the ability to have firearms.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine's spokesman, Steven Goldstein, accused the Florio campaign of hypocrisy, saying that Mr. Florio accepted nearly $7,000 in campaign donations from the National Rifle Association and gun manufacturers when he was a congressman in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Florio ''still has scars on his back from taking on the N.R.A.,'' according to his spokesman, Jim Lanard. Mr. Lanard said that Mr. Corzine's involvement with gun manufacturers raised questions about his sincerity.</p>
        <p>''Jon's actions speak a lot louder than his words,'' Mr. Lanard said.</p>
