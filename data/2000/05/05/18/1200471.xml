        <p>Patrick Ewing, facing up, 20 feet away on the right baseline, ridiculously out of his range. Latrell Sprewell, hyperactively dribbling around the perimeter, chucking up jump shots almost out of fear that he wouldn't get the ball back if he passed it. Allan Houston, the All-Star puzzled by the delirium around him, seemingly content with the best view of the game being played at American Airlines Arena.</p>
        <p>Awful shots, confusion and bewilderment. This is how Game 5 ended last night for the Knicks, a team whose delusions about returning to the National Basketball Association finals apparently turned out to be bigger than their hearts.</p>
        <p>''We can learn from this,'' Houston repeated, over and over, trying to make someone listen after the Knicks fell behind the Miami Heat in the four-of-seven-game Eastern Conference semifinals, 3-2. ''It's over. This game is over.''</p>
        <p>Houston had just missed 6 of 10 shots and did not score a point for a stretch of nearly three quarters. Every time Houston put the ball on the floor and seemed to have someone in foul trouble, Heat Coach Pat Riley inserted another defender. First, Dan Majerle. Then Jamal Mashburn and Bruce Bowen. They behaved like interchangeable linebackers salivating to make a big hit.</p>
        <p>The Knicks combusted on and off the floor, falling apart in the most important game of their season. Bringing all their liabilities to bear in an 87-81 loss to Alonzo Mourning, Mashburn and Riley's foot soldiers, the Knicks were simply beaten to the basketball by a more determined team.</p>
        <p>Sprewell carried them for the first two quarters, making difficult jump shots and playing at hyperspeed on the defensive end. Ewing, Larry Johnson and Charlie Ward found their games in the second half, but by then Sprewell could trust only himself for points. The bench was not giving him anything.</p>
        <p>Marcus Camby's dynamics meant nothing. In 23 of the most disappointing minutes of his career, he made 1 of 6 shots and collected four rebounds. Camby did not get rebounds as much as he was rebounded, his thin frame bouncing off the brawny Mourning, Clarence Weatherspoon and P. J. Brown like a pinball against a bumper.</p>
        <p>Every one wants to give Camby a pass be cause he is young, exuberant and tries so hard. But the Knicks simply could not afford to have one of the most important role players in the league foul out and render himself ineffective.</p>
        <p>Kurt Thomas: 10 minutes, 2 re bounds, 2 fouls. Chris Childs: 17 minutes, 3 fouls, 0 assists. On it went, unproductive line after unproductive line. Childs engaged in an argument with Ewing in the second quarter, apparently asking the Big Fella to get out of the way. Ewing barked back that he wanted the ball.</p>
        <p>''That had nothing to do with the outcome,'' Childs said afterward.</p>
        <p>He is right. But you would figure, nearly 90 games into the season, they would have worked this petty dissension stuff out, no?</p>
        <p>Riley's players receive high marks, especially for the way they handled the Knicks in the final minutes.</p>
        <p>''It's been four years of hard work, so there's nothing that I can say,'' he said afterward. ''It's really left up to them. The game was crucial tonight. Possessions were crucial. It really doesn't matter what plays you call throughout the course of those possessions, someone has got to step up. Somebody has got to be aggressive.''</p>
        <p>But the game was right there for the Knicks. Mourning had fouled out, and even after two Majerle 3-point bombs (one came from Phoenix, circa 1993), the Knicks were within 3 points with 50 seconds left.</p>
        <p>Suddenly, the 34-year-old Majerle, who still resembles a woozy middleweight contender too proud to drop, actually beat Sprewell off the dribble.</p>
        <p>Majerle found Bowen standing by himself in the left corner. Undrafted Bruce Bowen, who this year alone was traded by Philadelphia and released by the Chicago Bulls. He knocked the shot down as if he were a No. 1 pick. Ballgame.</p>
        <p>The Knicks were outrebounded by 42-32. Brown grabbed 12. It seems that no one can keep him off the glass. The Knicks do not hit the boards as much as they tickle and caress them, waiting for the ball to come their way instead of going after it.</p>
        <p>Now that they are down, three games to two, in this unpredictable theater, you expect their best at Madison Square Garden tomorrow night, the kind of resilience that has symbolized Knick runs of postseasons past. But in a weird way, they have been playing behind all season, catching up, trying to live up to an idea or an image of themselves that was never really there.</p>
        <p>They may not be a finals team, after all. When the Knicks look in the mirror today, they may just see a second-round-and-out bunch, unable to summon true resolve when they need it most.</p>
        <p>They made it to the finals last year, but they somehow forgot how they got there this season.</p>
        <p>Ewing not giving up the baseline to Mourning in the final minute. Houston finding a gap and his touch with a series on the line. Camby sailing in from the left side and the right side, dunking back rebounds. Sprewell racing past everyone.</p>
        <p>Maybe they have fed off adversity so much, it's all they know, the only way they can win. Maybe this is the prelude to another wing-and-a-prayer ending, brought to you by Houston and his persevering teammates.</p>
        <p>Spike Lee thinks so. The filmmaker and lifelong fan went into the locker room afterward to offer support. He was asked if the Knicks were done, about to go down to a Heat team that so many believed to be a rough bump in the road.</p>
        <p>He shook his head.</p>
        <p>''Got to do it the hard way,'' Lee said.</p>
        <p>You can change the coach, overhaul the roster, make trades and bring all the new pieces you want. Nothing changes.</p>
        <p>It's always the hard way.</p>
