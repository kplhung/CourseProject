        <p>TODD OLDHAM liked the camera so much he created a dress from its tiny snapshots. Britney Spears uses it onstage, snapping pictures of her fans. Polaroid's toylike I-zone, an instant pocket camera sold beside cash registers like a Snickers bar and offered in the shrill hues of teenage nail polish -- Wicked Wasabi, Go Grape Sorbet -- is the country's best-selling camera.</p>
        <p>The thumbnail-size I-zone images are as grainy and dark as ''The Blair Witch Project'' and enjoy a similar following: half the buyers are girls 14 to 17, who use them at parties and tack the pictures to notebooks and bulletin boards. Since last fall, two million I-zones have sold, at $25 each, making Polaroid profitable last year for the first time in five years. Polaroid, whose images were often found in real estate office windows, has returned to the party -- and the backyard and the family room.</p>
        <p>The I-zone and its instant-camera siblings, the larger Popshot and Joycam, mark a radical departure for Polaroid, whose success in the 1960's and 70's was based on technological innovation. Founded by an inventor, Edwin Land, it was run for years by engineers. Now, its innovations are coming from design, said David Laituri, Polaroid's manager of design strategy, who offered a peek at Polaroid's future.</p>
        <p>Mr. Laituri and his redesign team have taken pages from Swatch and Motorola to turn the cameras into highly personalized and fashion-influenced consumer products with a new design language, for a company that is speaking less formally and using a far hipper vocabulary.</p>
        <p>''We call our design language 'double bubble,' '' said Mr. Laituri, who came to Polaroid in 1998 from Lunar Design, where he helped shape home computers for Hewlett-Packard. Here, his design theme consists of an oval intersecting a circle. The shape expresses the function: the round lens and oval viewfinder intersect, visually suggesting their similar functions; double bubbles recur in the shutter pull ring of the Popshot. The ovals lend unifying style to the Polaroid product line.</p>
        <p>The I-zone was developed with Tomy, the Japanese toy and gadget maker, and became a hit in Japan in 1998. But Polaroid was slow to bring it to the United States, recalling failed forays into hipness like the Swinger (circa the late 60's). The low resolution images appalled many in the company, Mr. Laituri says.</p>
        <p>The new cameras make smaller pictures than the SX-70 and top-of-the-line Spectra cameras. The 1-by-1 1/2-inch image emerges from the I-zone on a paper strip that looks like a large colorful Band-Aid. Veiled and dark, the images are somehow fresh and new, like the first photographs.</p>
        <p>For a generation weaned on high tech and high resolution, the I-zone's small size and low resolution are welcome. So is the versatility of the sticker-backed film, inspired by photo vending booths in airports and bus stations. ''There was a lot of resistance within the company to the change,'' Mr. Laituri said. ''The key idea at Polaroid now is that it's not the quality of the image that is important. It's how you use it.''</p>
        <p>The use transcends the technology. This summer, Polaroid is introducing a hybrid camera, capable of producing I-zone film images or digital electronic images that can be downloaded into a computer, named the Combo Camera. Another product, developed under the name Webster, will scan I-cam images for posting on the Web. Both cameras tap the ideas of consultants like Ideo in San Francisco and Altitude and (Eleven), both based in Boston.</p>
        <p>Polariod intends these cameras to be social devices -- like the cell phone, which the I-zone resembles in size and shape. Taking pictures of one another at parties is a way for teenagers to communicate. (Adolescent girls in particular say they fear looking bad in a picture. A photo that develops instantly can be destroyed instantly, with no nasty negatives.)</p>
        <p>The idea is to produce cameras that reflect not just the personality of the owner but also her mood. New colors for the I-zone come out every few months. Feeling upbeat this morning? Grab a Go Grape model. More mellow? Go for the silver camera. A secondary line of ''tech translucent'' colors will be introduced starting next month, with names like Phat Blue and Concrete Jungle.</p>
        <p>If this seems far from the high-tech vision of Edwin Land -- he helped design the cameras in the U-2 spy plane in the late 1950's -- the I-zone harks back to his principles. He was both a brilliant technician and a man driven by democratic ideals.</p>
        <p>His relationship with Henry Dreyfuss produced the SX-70 in 1972. Fine tool, but also fun toy, it was the camera Andy Warhol took to parties and discos, his portraits composing an informal documentary of the Manhattan scene of the 1970's. At this year's Walker Evans shows at the Metropolitan Museum and the Museum of Modern Art, Polaroid SX-70 photographs hang beside his best-known black-and-white photographs. Of the SX-70, Evans said that for the first time, one could ''put a machine in an artist's hand and have him then rely entirely on his vision and his taste and his mind.''</p>
        <p>Land's first inspiration for instant photography was, he said, a request from his teenage daughter, who wondered why she could not see family vacation snapshots right way.</p>
        <p>He had an idealistic vision of a camera that would release the artist in everyone. ''My basic faith, is in the random competence of people in all walks of life, at any level of income, of any derivation,'' he said. ''There is a common sense of beauty and of manual aptitudes.''</p>
        <p>That these competences should turn up at teenage girls' slumber parties would have delighted Land -- and probably should not have surprised Polaroid's engineers.</p>
