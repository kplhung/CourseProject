        <p>In a management shake-up that shows that even the most promising publishing team does not always guarantee a smooth start-up, the managing editor of Real Simple -- a new magazine from Time Inc. for women who want to simplify their lives -- resigned yesterday.</p>
        <p>The departure of the editor, Susan Wyland, comes after only two issues, both of which have been criticized by some advertisers as overly spare and unwelcoming. Ms. Wyland, a former editor of Martha Stewart Living, was encouraged to leave by a group of senior Time executives headed by Ann S.

        <p>In a management shake-up that shows that even the most promising publishing team does not always guarantee a smooth start-up, the managing editor of Real Simple -- a new magazine from Time Inc. for women who want to simplify their lives -- resigned yesterday.</p>
        <p>The departure of the editor, Susan Wyland, comes after only two issues, both of which have been criticized by some advertisers as overly spare and unwelcoming. Ms. Wyland, a former editor of Martha Stewart Living, was encouraged to leave by a group of senior Time executives headed by Ann S. Moore, the president of the People division of Time Warner's Time, Time executives said. The group publishes People, People en Espanol, Teen People and In Style.</p>
        <p>Ms. Wyland was considered especially ardent as an editor, in part because she had first brought the idea to Time. But at one point before publication of the first issue, she and the magazine's publisher, Alexander Sareyan, were not even on speaking terms, the executives said. Ms. Wyland declined to comment yesterday.</p>
        <p>Carrie Tuhy, an assistant managing editor at In Style magazine, will take over as managing editor; it has not yet been decided if Ms. Tuhy will remain on the job permanently. Isolde Motley, the former managing editor of Life magazine who was named corporate editor of Time Inc. last week, will oversee the magazine.</p>
        <p>Personnel issues aside, the failure of the magazine to become an instant critical hit may reveal more about the success of the People division than about Real Simple. The last two new magazines out of the division, In Style and Teen People, have raised expectations for the division. In Style, which was introduced in 1994, has a circulation of 1.4 million, according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations; Teen People, introduced in 1998, has a circulation of 1.6 million, and People en Espanol, introduced in 1996, has a circulation of 300,000.</p>
        <p>The Time Inc. executives said advertisers were not committing to the fall issues because the magazine was too plain to attract readers.</p>
