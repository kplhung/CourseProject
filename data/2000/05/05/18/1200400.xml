        <p>Weighing in the balance of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's decision on whether to stay in the Senate race are the millions of dollars he has raised in his effort to defeat Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>Nearly half of the $19 million has been donated by out-of-state voters, many of whom answered solicitations because they despise his opponent. Yet under federal law, Mr. Giuliani may squirrel away every cent of the more than $9 million he has not spent -- even if he drops out.</p>
        <p>That prospect irritates Michael Ross, a St. Louis banker, who contributed as much as federal law allows to the mayor's Senate race. Sure, he admires Mr. Giuliani and wishes him well. But the $2,000 in checks he wrote to the Friends of Giuliani account were for one purpose, he said: keeping Mrs. Clinton out of the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>''You could put Mickey Mouse in there and I would give him money,'' Mr. Ross said. ''If he drops out, the money should go to his successor. Any other course would look bad and it would ultimately help Hillary out.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's most likely replacement, Representative Rick A. Lazio of Long Island, could certainly use the assistance, state Republican leaders said. Mr. Lazio has little name recognition outside the New York City region and no statewide campaign infrastructure in place. He has about $3.5 million in the bank, for his re-election bid. But if he stepped into the most expensive and high profile Senate race in the nation, he would need to raise $10 million to $15 million more, political consultants said.</p>
        <p>The mayor, who announced in the last three weeks that he has prostate cancer, is separating from his wife and is having a relationship with an Upper East Side woman, again yesterday offered no concrete hints on what was in his political future or what he would do with his campaign war chest if he dropped out.</p>
        <p>His campaign staff continued its work unabated, with two aides dispatched to Buffalo to help select the music, lighting and stage design for the Republican nominating convention on May 30.</p>
        <p>The mayor had no public appearances, but he indicated yesterday that he was still struggling to decide on a cancer treatment regimen.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to think about it,'' Mr. Giuliani said, on his way out of 17 Murray Street, a restaurant near City Hall, where he had walked to lunch after a morning of meetings with some of his closest advisers, including his campaign manager, Bruce J. Teitelbaum, and a friend, Elliot Cuker. ''The decision-making process is fine. I am not going to comment on it today.''</p>
        <p>What has become clear in recent days, is that if the mayor backs out, he risks alienating some of approximately 200,000 campaign donors. As of the end of March, Mr. Giuliani had spent $10.1 million starting up his campaign against Mrs. Clinton, leaving $9.2 million in the bank.</p>
        <p>Federal law does not allow the mayor to give his money directly to Mr. Lazio or another replacement candidate, but the mayor could transfer it to a state or national Republican Party committee that could spend it on Mr. Lazio's behalf.</p>
        <p>The mayor could also donate some or all of the money to charity, said Kenneth A. Gross, a Washington-based election law expert and former head of enforcement at the Federal Election Commission. Finally, he could follow the lead of Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey. As of earlier this year, she had returned about half of the $2.2 million she had raised, after she bowed out of a New Jersey race for the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>But several political consultants and campaign finance experts said that the mayor, if he pulled out, would most likely not rely on any of those options for the majority of his remaining cash. Instead, he would save it for a future run for governor or some other office, they said.</p>
        <p>''It would surprise me if he does not hang on to the lion's share of it,'' said Jay Severin, a New York-based Republican consultant who has worked on 100 campaigns since 1980.</p>
        <p>Kieran Mahoney, a Republican consultant who has worked on more than 160 races, said, ''He has no incentive to give most of the money away.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Severin and Mr. Mahoney, as well as several Democratic political consultants, agreed that the mayor would most likely give at least a share of his $9 million to a Republican Party committee that would assist his successor in the Senate race. To keep every cent would offend the party, they said.</p>
        <p>Some donors said that Mr. Giuliani should give up all of the out-of-state contributions, given that so many were motivated by an anti-Clinton sentiment.</p>
        <p>''Yes, the money was for Rudy, but the investment I made was in the Senate race,'' said Andrew J. Futey, a government relations consultant from Cleveland who contributed $1,000 to Mr. Giuliani's campaign. ''The main goal here is making sure there is somebody else besides Hillary. I would like to see my money stay in the race.''</p>
        <p>For a replacement to make up the difference in the next several months would be very difficult, many said. By the end of March, Mrs. Clinton  had $6.6 million in the bank of the $12.8 million she had raised.</p>
        <p>By following the advice of Mr. Ross and Mr. Futey, the mayor would risk alienating other Republicans who said in interviews that they were not so sure they wanted to see their money go to Mr. Lazio. Mr. Giuliani, though a Republican, has stands on several issues traditionally associated with Democrats, such as his support of abortion rights and  gun control. Mr. Lazio's record is not as consistently moderate.</p>
        <p>Wendell A. Peterson of Ida, Mich., said that he considered himself a liberal Republican, and that though he could not control what the mayor did with his $500 donation, he would be disappointed if it ended up being spent to elect Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>''I grew up in politics with Republicans like Rockefeller of New York,'' he said, referring to Nelson A. Rockefeller, the New York governor from 1959 to 1973. ''I view Mr. Giuliani as a Republican in that tradition, and that was the primary reason I gave money to him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio caused a rustle of attention last night when he arrived at a Conservative Party dinner, wearing a tuxedo. He said repeatedly that he was waiting for Mr. Giuliani to make a decision and did not want to interfere during the mayor's difficult time. ''I think right now it would probably be unseemly for me to make any overt gestures that could be exploiting this time he's choosing to make his decision,'' Mr. Lazio said.</p>
