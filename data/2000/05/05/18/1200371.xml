        <p>The oldest record in swimming, in the women's 200-meter butterfly, was broken here tonight at the Australian Olympic trials after 19 years.</p>
        <p>Susie O'Neill, a 26-year-old who has been pursuing the record for several years, clocked a time of 2 minutes 5.81 seconds, breaking the mark of 2:05.96 set by Mary T. Meagher of the United States in 1981.</p>
        <p>''This is the one I am after,'' O'Neill said before the race here at the Sydney Aquatic Center, which will be the venue for the Summer Olympic Games swimming. She won the event at the Atlanta Games in 1996, and on several occasions had come tantalizing close to Meagher's mark. Tonight, cheered by a crowd of 10,000, she accomplished the goal and surpassed the swimmer she had idolized since getting Meagher's autograph as a teenager.</p>
        <p>''Finally, I did it,'' O'Neill gasped in a poolside TV interview after hugging her coach, Scott Volkers. ''Over the last few yards I felt strong. The crowd helped me get to the wall.</p>
        <p>''I'd like to go faster, and with record pressure gone, I'll be more relaxed.''</p>
        <p>In the 1990's, swimming records rarely lasted more than a year or two, so Meagher's mark, set almost two decades ago, had become a unique target. It had held up against the best efforts of strong East German and Chinese swimming teams the past two decades, and in the swimming world it was viewed with the same reverence as Bob Beamon's long jump record, which stood for 23 years, was in track and field.</p>
        <p>O'Neill's achievement tonight, reaching across two generations of champions, won her a matching share of the world swimming spotlight currently focused on her compatriot Ian Thorpe, who set world records three times this week. Tonight's mark was set in a race at the midpoint of a week of national qualifiers for the Olympic events, which are scheduled here in September.</p>
        <p>Last August, O'Neill, holder of 34 Australian free and fly titles and records, launched a long-planned challenge to Meagher's elusive mark at the Pan Pacific championships here but failed then by 64-hundredths of a second.</p>
        <p>Tonight, O'Neill, a veteran among her many teenage teammates, was almost one second ahead of the world pace at 100 meters and 150 meters. Over the last few strokes, with the crowd and commentators shouting her on, she slowed slightly but just managed to reach the finish line in record time.</p>
        <p>O'Neill's rewriting of part of a long-closed page of the record book came more than a decade after her first title, in the 50-meter butterfly in the 1989 nationals when she was a 15-year-old still in junior high school.</p>
        <p>Meagher was 16 years old when she set the previous record on Aug. 13, 1981, at Brown Deer, Wis. She now uses her married name, Mary Plant, and lives in Peachtree City, Ga., with her husband and two children. She praised O'Neill's perseverance.</p>
        <p>''She missed it a few times but kept her head down and kept working and finally did it, so all the credit goes to her,'' she told The Associated Press. ''I couldn't ask for a better way to have that door in my life closed.</p>
        <p>''There's a sadness, a sentimentality that my name is no longer in the record books.''</p>
        <p>Thorpe, who will reach his 18th birthday a few weeks after the Olympics, set three world records in three days here in the 200-meter and 400-meter freestyle qualifiers.</p>
        <p>Tonight he was fourth in the 100-meter final. This qualified him for Olympic relay starts also.</p>
