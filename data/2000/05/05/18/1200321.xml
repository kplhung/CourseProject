        <p>Flags of Our Fathers, James Bradley's hugely successful book about the six Marines who raised the flag on Iwo Jima during World War II, was rejected by 27 publishers, sometimes scornfully, before Katie Hall, Bantam editor, recognized its potential; photo (M)</p>

        <p>''No one wants to read a book about old men weeping into the telephone.'' This was perhaps the harshest of 27 rejections that a particular book proposal received when it was offered around in New York in 1997 and 1998. But there were 26 others, representing nearly all of the most esteemed publishers in the country. They were just as unyieldingly dense, if not quite as nasty, when it came to evaluating the project's possibilities. It was, as it turned out, one of those fantastical enormities in judgment, as unprophetic as it was ridiculous, that engulfs the industry periodically, like the coming of the locust.

        <p>It is ''Flags of Our Fathers,'' the story of the six young men who raised a flag on Iwo Jima and who, by accident, became forever part of the iconic frieze of what the book's authors call ''The Photograph.''

        <p>''No one wants to read a book about old men weeping into the telephone.'' This was perhaps the harshest of 27 rejections that a particular book proposal received when it was offered around in New York in 1997 and 1998. But there were 26 others, representing nearly all of the most esteemed publishers in the country. They were just as unyieldingly dense, if not quite as nasty, when it came to evaluating the project's possibilities. It was, as it turned out, one of those fantastical enormities in judgment, as unprophetic as it was ridiculous, that engulfs the industry periodically, like the coming of the locust. For the book dismissed with such general brio by publishing's best and brightest has become the surprise runaway nonfiction best seller of the season.</p>
        <p>It is ''Flags of Our Fathers,'' the story of the six young men who raised a flag on Iwo Jima and who, by accident, became forever part of the iconic frieze of what the book's authors call ''The Photograph.'' Written by James Bradley, son of one of the flag-raisers, with Ron Powers, the book (from Bantam) will be No. 3 on The New York Times nonfiction best-seller list on Sunday and will rise to No. 2 the following week. It had an initial printing of 60,000 when it went on sale on May 2. There are now 270,000 in print.</p>
        <p>So why was it so soundly and roundly rejected? The acquisition of a book is mostly a subjective decision, often involving nothing more than personal taste, but of course there are other factors. Was the proposal submitted by the writer and the agent compelling? Will the finished product deliver on the promise of that proposal? Will it be too hard to get the manuscript in publishable shape? Will it be a good book? Will anybody buy it? (Certainly it is true that most books celebrating the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II went unread.)</p>
        <p>But there is another, maybe even subliminal reason. Most book editors and publishers were culturally formed by the 1960's and 70's and seem to suffer that Manhattan-West Coast ambivalence if not aversion to things military. As one publisher said: ''There's a snobbishness about book people. They aren't attracted intellectually to stories about soldiers. They are seen as Middle America books, which is still a hard sell to editors. Even editors who come from Middle America like to forget that.'' (Give a publisher Tom Clancy, and see how he overcomes this allergy.)</p>
        <p>The movie ''Saving Private Ryan'' began to change that antagonism for soldiering, but ''Flags'' was offered around before the movie.</p>
        <p>Now, ''Flags'' is not the first hugely successful book that was hideously rejected, although most of them were fiction works. Twenty-three publishers rejected the first Dr. Seuss book, and John Grisham had trouble getting sold. Seventeen didn't want Irving Stone's ''Lust for Life.'' Twenty-two said no to Richard Hooker's ''M*A*S*H,'' and 18 disdained ''Jonathan Livingston Seagull'' by Richard Bach. Laurence Peter's ''Peter Principle'' failed to entice 16 publishers, and Thor Heyerdahl's true tale of crossing the Pacific on a raft, ''Kon-Tiki,'' simply wasn't exciting enough for 20 of them.</p>
        <p>Little comfort to the authors and agents for ''Flags'' back in 1998. A number of the rejects suggested, in the words of one, that ''nobody saw a particularly big market'' for the work. Indeed, one prominent editor and one publisher known for his literary smarts each thought that ''Flags'' would make a dandy magazine article, but forget it as a book. In a manuscript that was really all about the personal stories of six individuals, one editor, speaking for himself and five colleagues, wrote that the biggest problem ''was trying to figure out how to present the personal stories.''</p>
        <p>It isn't my intent to embarrass anyone, so I am leaving the blameworthy nameless. And to be fair, the book's proposal underwent changes when Mr. Powers was brought in as the writer, and the project was given to two new agents, Frank Weinmann and Jim Hornfischer, but nonetheless one would have thought that some smart editor somewhere would have seen its potential.</p>
        <p>Well, one finally did. She was Katie Hall, then 30, an unwarlike editor at Bantam, who grew up in Indiana and graduated from DePauw University and who actually didn't think of it as a war book at all, or even a ''boy'' book. She recalled: ''You had to see beyond the battle of Iwo Jima. It was the back story that counted, six boys who grew up in the 30's and who came together from all parts of small-town America, and did this by accident. We could tell a story about what it was like to be a kid in the 30's. There's a big America between the coasts.''</p>
        <p>As Ms. Hall, now a senior editor, tells it: ''Perhaps it wasn't that clearly shown in the proposal, but it was so obvious immediately. I walked into Irwyn's,'' that's Irwyn Applebaum, publisher of the Bantam Dell Publishing Group, ''and said, 'There's a beautiful back story here.' And he got it immediately and said, 'Let's go for it.' '' And they did, for an advance of only $75,000. Ms. Hall says that perhaps her Indiana roots helped her ''see'' the book in the proposal. On the other hand, Mr. Applebaum grew up in Queens.</p>
        <p>Quite naturally, Mr. Bradley and Mr. Powers are thrilled with Ms. Hall. ''Before she came along,'' Mr. Bradley said, ''I was used to very literate people sitting down and composing a letter telling me what an idiot I am. You know the title of the book that was in my mind was 'Mothers and Sons,' so I was glad to have a female editor.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Powers was equally impressed. ''She understood military history and was interested in having a salable product,'' he said. ''But she was also interested in a strong narrative. I give her a lot of credit for our success.''</p>
        <p>''Flags'' is apparently destined to become one of those great word-of-mouth best sellers. Everyone I know who has read it, myself included, has urged it on friends. Will it start a trend, since publishers, like moviemakers, seem slavish at times to trends? Most likely.</p>
        <p>Probably ''Flags'' has been helped by Tom Brokaw's two best sellers, ''The Greatest Generation'' and ''The Greatest Generation Speaks'' (both from Random House), the latter a collection of letters by people who fought in World War II. But one wonders: If those books had not been proposed by a celebrity, would anyone have published them?</p>
