        <p>Nearly 37 years after a bombing that horrified the nation, the authorities here charged two longtime suspects with murder today in the deaths of four black girls in the explosion at Birmingham's 16th Street Baptist Church.</p>
        <p>Thomas E. Blanton Jr. and Bobby Frank Cherry, both of whom were affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan and have been considered suspects for decades in the 1963 bombing, turned themselves in this morning after being indicted by a state grand jury on Tuesday. They are being held in the Jefferson County jail here without bond.</p>
        <p>Only one man, Robert Chambliss, has ever been tried in the case, and that was not until 1977, 14 years after the bombing. He was convicted of murder, sentenced to life and died in prison in 1985. Herman Cash, another man named as a suspect in early Federal Bureau of Investigation case files, died in 1994 without ever being charged.</p>
        <p>Federal authorities reopened their investigation of the bombing in 1996,  but they declined today to discuss the evidence they have gathered against Mr. Blanton, 61, of Birmingham, and Mr. Cherry, 69, of Mabank, Tex.</p>
        <p>Several of Mr. Cherry's relatives, including an ex-wife and a granddaughter, have said they told grand jurors that Mr. Cherry had boasted of taking part in the bombing. But there is little information about what additional new evidence, if any, investigators may have found to implicate either Mr. Cherry or Mr. Blanton, whose indictment came as more of a surprise.</p>
        <p>Asked about the evidence at a news conference today, Doug Jones, the United States attorney here, would only say, ''We expect the evidence today to be a good bit different than it would have been 36 years ago.''</p>
        <p>Though some witnesses have died and there have been no reports of new physical evidence, prosecutors said today that they were optimistic about their chances to win convictions in the Birmingham case. ''The witnesses that we have, we believe, are sufficient to sustain the charge,'' Mr. Jones said.</p>
        <p>The prosecutions of Mr. Blanton and Mr. Cherry are the latest in a series of dusty civil rights cases that have been reopened in recent years as a new breed of Southern prosecutors have come to power, as new witnesses have come forward to relieve guilty consciences, and as changing times and demographics have made it easier to impanel jurors willing to convict whites for the murders of blacks.</p>
        <p>The most notable case was the 1994 conviction of Byron de la Beckwith for the 1963 assassination of  Medgar Evers, a prominent organizer with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, in Mississippi. But there have been numerous others in several states, and Mississippi officials are now delving again into the 1964 murders of three civil rights workers -- Andrew Goodman, James Chaney and Michael Schwerner.</p>
        <p>The Birmingham bombing holds a special place in civil rights history because of the randomness of its violence, the sacredness of its target and the innocence of its victims. The four girls -- Denise McNair, 11, and Addie Mae Collins, Carole Robertson and Cynthia Wesley, all 14 -- died in a dressing room in the church basement when the bomb detonated at 10:19 a.m. on Sunday, Sept. 15, 1963. About 20 other people were injured.  The bomb, apparently hidden under the church steps the night before, blew the face of Jesus out of a stained glass window. The bodies of the girls, who were dressed in white for an annual youth service, were found beneath the rubble.</p>
        <p>The church had been a center of civil rights activity in Birmingham, a city that experienced some of the most violent resistance of the day. Perhaps as much as any single act, the bombing aroused public sentiment against Southern segregationists and emboldened civil rights leaders to redouble their efforts. More recently, the incident was the subject of Spike Lee's acclaimed documentary, ''Four Little Girls.''</p>
        <p>In an unusual circumstance, the cases brought today will be tried in the state courts here even though the Federal Bureau of Investigation and federal prosecutors have led the reexamination of the bombing. Mr. Jones said his ability to prosecute the case in the federal courts was hindered by jurisdictional issues and by the statute of limitations.</p>
        <p>He declined to address comments made by one of Mr. Cherry's lawyers in published reports that he had offered Mr. Cherry a light sentence in exchange for a guilty plea on federal charges of interstate transportation of dynamite. In cases where the dynamite causes a death, that charge is not subject to the statute of limitations.</p>
        <p>There is no statute of limitations for murder. If the case goes to trial, Mr. Jones and one of his assistants will be deputized as special state prosecutors and will join a deputy district attorney in the courtroom.</p>
        <p>Both Mr. Blanton and Mr. Cherry were charged today with eight counts of first-degree murder -- four for intentional murder and four for murder with universal malice. The two sets of charges essentially will give jurors a choice, said David Barber, the district attorney.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barber said he would not pursue the death penalty against Mr. Blanton and Mr. Cherry. He said they would have to be tried under the death penalty statute that existed in 1963, a statute that has since been changed because of constitutional concerns.</p>
        <p>Neither Mr. Blanton nor Mr. Cherry made any public comment today as they were brought to jail by their lawyers. Mr. Blanton arrived first, at about 7:30 a.m., and Mr. Cherry showed up shortly before noon, chauffeured by his lawyers in a silver Lexus bearing the license tag N OCENT.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for both men said their clients would plead not guilty.</p>
        <p>''He has maintained his innocence for 37 years,'' said David S. Luker, Mr. Blanton's lawyer. ''You just wonder what information they possess now that they didn't possess for the last 37 years. People's memories don't get better with time, just worse.''</p>
        <p>Mickey Johnson, one of Mr. Cherry's lawyers, said he was trying to soothe his client, who has suffered two heart attacks. ''We're trying to keep him somewhat positive in his outlook,'' he said. ''He's an old man.''</p>
        <p>Unlike Mr. Blanton, who has made few comments about the bombing over the years, Mr. Cherry has proclaimed his innocence in frequent interviews and news conferences. While he has acknowledged his past membership in the Klan, he has maintained that he was at his Birmingham home watching wrestling on television the night the bomb was planted. A recent report in The Clarion-Ledger of Jackson, Miss., disclosed that there were no wrestling programs on television in Birmingham that night.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cherry has been in Alabama since May 4, when he was extradited from Texas on charges that he sexually abused his former stepdaughter when she was a child. That charge emerged as the stepdaughter and other relatives were called to testify before a grand jury about the bombing case.</p>
        <p>Maxine McNair, the only parent of a victim who could be reached today, said that she and her husband, a longtime county commissioner here, had decided not to comment about the indictments. ''It's an interesting day, I'll put it that way,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But many Birmingham residents and others with stark memories of the bombing clearly saw the day's events as an important step in this city's efforts to salve its racial wounds. Several said they were gratified to see the federal government leading the way. The government's role in the case had been questioned because of the disclosure two decades ago that J. Edgar Hoover, the former F.B.I. director, had shelved the investigation in the 1960's despite the optimism of his subordinates in Birmingham that it could be successfully prosecuted.</p>
        <p>''This was a tragedy of just absolute monumental proportions,'' Mr. Jones said. ''It has scarred the city of Birmingham for almost 37 years. There needs to be some kind of closure, one way or another.''</p>
        <p>The Rev. John H. Cross, the pastor of the 16th Street Baptist Church at the time of the bombing, recalled Sept. 15, 1963, as ''a terrible day, a day that never ended.'' Today's indictments, he said, ''will help to ease the temper of the city.''</p>
