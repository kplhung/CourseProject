      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>SO after three hours of an interview over a theater district lunch, the playwright offers a romantic tale that is remarkable, magical even, if possibly embroidered. It cries out for retelling somewhere in this article, but there's a structure problem: it doesn't readily fit.</p>
        <p>The problem is put to the playwright.</p>
        <p>Moises Kaufman! Your troupe, Tectonic Theater Project, is named for the word that means the art and science of structure. If anyone knows about building a story, about interviewing, writing and editing, it's you: you and your actors made six trips in a year to interview the people of Laramie, Wyo., about the murder of Matthew Shepard, the gay student who was beaten and bound to a fence post outside town. Then you boiled 400 hours of tape into a two-and-a-half-hour play, ''The Laramie Project,'' which has its New York opening tonight at the Union Square Theater.</p>
        <p>How would you work into this story the romantic tale you just recounted? Mr. Kaufman pauses. Then, with the kind of full-body smile that animates a devotee of pleasure, he comes up with the solution. (Wait till the end.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaufman, the playwright and director whose first play, the award-winning ''Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde,'' ran for nearly two years in New York, is an excellent lunch companion. He tells anecdotes laced with anguish as well as a pirouetting, impish wit, punctuated with well-timed shrugs.</p>
        <p>''Can I smoke?'' he inquires. ''Will you hate it? Oh. Well, I can not do it, I suppose. But then I'll hate it.'' He smiles balefully. He lights up.</p>
        <p>At 36, Mr. Kaufman has begun wearing his numerous outsider identities more comfortably. In overwhelmingly Catholic and adamantly heterosexual Caracas, Venezuela, he was a yeshiva-trained Orthodox Jew with sidelocks, hiding from his own people because he was gay.</p>
        <p>And in New York, where he moved in 1987, this son of Eastern European Holocaust survivors is often categorized as Latino.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaufman can be sardonic about these conflicts (''My boyfriend isn't Jewish, oy vey!'') but he also speaks with pain and understanding, even gentleness. Referring to Talmudic arcs fusing into a coherent circle, he calls himself a hedonist with a profound belief in God.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaufman mops his plate, leaving only bread crusts. ''Children of survivors live with the survivor experience,'' he says. ''My father ate everything on his plate even if he didn't like it. He thought being satiated didn't exist.</p>
        <p>''In Romania during the war, he made the yellow Stars of David that Jews had to wear, cutting them from sheets and painting them with egg yolks. When I would ask, he would just say, 'I was 12 and I was hungry.' That would end the conversation.''</p>
        <p>AND so in 1998, when the image of a dying Matthew Shepard, bound to a prairie fence, suggested to many a Crucifixion-like martyrdom, Mr. Kaufman had a very different response: ''I immediately thought of the electrified fences around concentration camps.''</p>
        <p>To grapple with the murder and its ripples, Mr. Kaufman turned to theater. Using grant money from ''Gross Indecency,'' which has had some 40 productions, he took his company to Wyoming. The story of how the New Yorkers seek out Laramie's ranchers, bartenders and ministers even works its way into the script.</p>
        <p>''You know, in Laramie, there are no synagogues or gay bars,'' Mr. Kaufman remarks. ''So the Jews celebrate Shabbat in each other's homes, and gays get together with potluck dinners. They're both underground communities.''</p>
        <p>He has long depended on theater for translation and explanation. As a teenager, confused and terrified by his homosexuality, he saw ''Torch Song Trilogy'' while in San Francisco, and cried with relief.</p>
        <p>Years later, he directed ''Gross Indecency,'' which is about the persecution of Wilde for a homosexual relationship, at the same San Francisco theater.</p>
        <p>''It is a beautiful play,'' he says dreamily, and catches himself. ''Is it terrible for me to say things like that about my own work?''</p>
        <p>Now for that romantic tale, which he gives a theme: ''It's about how I owe everything important in my life to the theater, including meeting my boyfriend.''</p>
        <p>First day, workshop on political theater, New York University, circa 1989. Enter Mr. Kaufman, Jeffrey LaHoste, a graduate student in political science, and a wild-eyed Brazilian professor.</p>
        <p>Professor: ''New York is a very difficult city! There is not enough love here! Turn to the person next to you and em-brraaace them!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaufman, Mr. LaHoste, utter strangers, embrace. Mutually embarrassed by their mutual attraction, they do not speak to each other for three weeks.</p>
        <p>Last day of class. Mr. Kaufman, steeling himself, feels a tap on his shoulder.</p>
        <p>Mr. LaHoste (nervous, blurting): ''I just wanted to tell you -- I love your shoes!''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaufman (ecstatic, blurting): ''We have to get married so we can tell our children how we met!''</p>
        <p>End scene.</p>
        <p>Children, Mr. Kaufman?</p>
        <p>Mr. Kaufman, whose companion, Mr. LaHoste, is Tectonic's managing director, has given destruction and continuity much thought, and dreams of fatherhood. He muses, ''I think being a parent is the most hedonistic experience of all.''</p>
