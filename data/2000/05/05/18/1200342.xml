        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>PALESTINIANS: CLASHES CONTINUE -- Sporadic clashes between young Palestinians and Israeli troops continued in the West Bank and near Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip. Israeli soldiers fired tear gas and rubber bullets at protesters who threw stones and firebombs; they also reported that Israeli posts had been fired upon and that they responded with live fire.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: TYING UP BARAK -- Two opposition bills that could tie Prime Minister Ehud Barak's hands in negotiations with the Palestinians passed preliminary votes, although both require three more readings to become law. They would require absolute majority approval of the Parliament to change the municipal boundaries of Jerualem and to allow the right of return of Palestinian refugees to Israel.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: UNCERTAIN WELCOME -- A Palestinian legislator said eggs were thrown at President Costas Stephanopoulos of Greece as he toured the walled Old City, to protest his position on Jerusalem. Greek and Israeli officials, however, adamantly denied the claim. ''Not a single egg was thrown at the Greek president,'' said an indignant spokesman for the Israeli police.</p>
        <p>Deborah Sontag (NYT)</p>
        <p>IRAN: JAILED FOR ATTACK -- A revolutionary court handed down a 15-year jail sentence to Said Asghar, a chemistry student accused of shooting a leading Iranian reformer, Said Hajarian, the official news agency reported. Four other defendants were sentenced to between 3 and 10 years for their role in the attack on Mr. Hajarian, who was in a coma for several days after the shooting. Three others were acquitted.</p>

        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>AUSTRIA: FORCED-LABOR ACCORD -- After a two-day conference attended by delegates from the United States, Austria and six eastern European countries, Austria agreed in principle to a $390 million compensation fund for Nazi-era forced laborers. The fund is to be distributed among 150,000 survivors, most in eastern Europe. A meeting on the ''legal closure'' of the accord will be held in Washington on May 30.</p>
        <p>Victor Homola (NYT)</p>
        <p>YUGOSLAVIA: CLEARING THE DANUBE -- A plan to clear bomb wreckage that has blocked the Danube for more than a year has finally been agreed upon. The president of the Danube Commission in Budapest told Reuters that work on a $21 million plan is scheduled to begin in about five months. Three bridges in Novi Sad, Serbia, were bombed by NATO as part of the campaign to end the expulsion of Albanians from Kosovo. The wreckage of one bridge, the Varazdin, has blocked barge traffic ever since.</p>
        <p>Donald G. McNeil Jr. (NYT)</p>
        <p>RUSSIA: NUCLEAR PACT APPROVED -- The upper house of Parliament voted after a secret debate to ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban treaty, which the lower house ratified last month. While Russia has not conducted a nuclear test since 1990, it will officially forswear the tests only after the United States and a handful of other nuclear powers, including China, Pakistan and India, also approve it. The United States Senate rejected the treaty last year.</p>
        <p>Michael Wines (NYT)</p>
        <p>THE AMERICAS</p>
        <p>CANADA: ALBERTA WARNED -- Health Minister Alan Rock has threatened to withhold health funding from Alberta after it approved a law to allow overnight stays in private clinics, which Canadians fear might undercut the national health service monopoly. Mr. Rock also said he would double the budget for inspectors to check for violations of the Canada Health Act, which created the state monopoly for much health care.</p>
        <p>James Brooke (NYT)</p>
        <p>COLOMBIA: DOUBTS ON BOMB -- The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia may be innocent of the ''necklace bomb'' killing that prompted the government to cancel a key meeting with them, and overall peace talks have not been interrupted, a top government official said. Attorney General Alfonso Gomez said another group may have been responsible for strapping a bomb to the neck of a woman after raiding her country estate, contradicting President Andres Pastrana's certainty in blaming the rebels.</p>
        <p>(Agence France-Presse)</p>
        <p>ASIA</p>
        <p>SRI LANKA: BLAST KILLS 23 -- At least 23 people were killed by a bomb blast near a Buddhist temple in the eastern town of Batticola. The government blamed the Tamil Tigers for the attack, which occurred as the birth of the Buddha was being celebrated.</p>
        <p>Barry Bearak (NYT)</p>
        <p>JAPAN: PREMIER'S APOLOGY -- Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori made a ''heartfelt apology'' for calling Japan a ''divine country with an emperor at its core.'' Mr. Mori's comments, to a Shinto religious group, drew widespread criticism for violating the spirit of the postwar Constitution guaranteeing a secular state. Shinto was the official religion of wartime Japan, and the emperor was regarded as a deity.</p>
        <p>Howard W. French (NYT)</p>
        <p>INDONESIA: NEW CLASHES -- At least 23 people were killed in new violence between Muslims and Christians in Ambon, in the Maluku islands, residents said. Twenty-one died when security forces opened fire to try to separate the warring mobs, they said.</p>
        <p>(Agence France-Presse)</p>
        <p>AFRICA</p>
        <p>ZAMBIA: KAUNDA BOWS OUT -- Kenneth D. Kaunda, left, the country's founding president, has handed over the leadership of the United National Independence Party, the main opposition party, to the former governor of the central bank, Francis Nkhoma, ending a political career that spanned more than four decades. Mr. Nkhoma, a 63-year old economist, beat eight other candidates.</p>
        <p>(Reuters)</p>
        <p>ZIMBABWE: OPPOSITION ACTS -- The Movement for Democratic Change said it would seek a court order to shift the deadline for nominating candidates for the June 24-25 election, which could delay the vote. The party said the government broke the law by setting nomination and poll dates before district boundaries were drawn.</p>
