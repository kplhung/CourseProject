        <p>Providence College yesterday expelled three basketball players and barred a fourth from varsity sports for a year as punishment for an off-campus fight with other students last month.</p>
        <p>Three other players were placed on personal probation for two years, meaning they may attend classes and participate in extracurricular activities but can be immediately suspended for any subsequent violation of student standards of conduct.</p>
        <p>''We take this extraordinarily seriously,'' said the Rev. Philip A. Smith, the college president. ''It is an extremely painful thing to have to carry out these types of sanctions and an extremely difficult tragedy to have an incident of assault where three other students are hurt.''</p>
        <p>A six-member disciplinary committee had previously imposed punishments against the seven students, and dropped charges against an eighth. Smith and the college's vice president for student services upheld all sanctions, and there is no further possibility of appeal.</p>
        <p>Providence will not release the names of the students, nor will it say how many appealed their punishments. Appeals were automatic for those punished by suspension or dismissal.</p>
        <p>Four of the players have been charged by the police in the April 10 fight. Investigators have said that the basketball players went to the apartment of Thomas Cook, a Providence senior and a bouncer at a local bar, to confront him because Cook removed center David Murray from the bar days earlier.</p>
        <p>Murray and two other players -- guard Donta Wade and forward center Llewellyn Cole -- punched and kicked Cook, the police said.</p>
        <p>Wade was also charged with hitting one of Cook's roommates, Mark Hogan, another Providence student. A fourth player, Jamaal Camah, was charged with punching a student who lives at the house.</p>
