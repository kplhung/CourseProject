        <p>Stepping up his criticism of Gov. George W. Bush's proposal to let taxpayers invest some of their Social Security taxes, Vice President Al Gore told a convention of older Americans today that the plan could jeopardize the retirement benefits even of current recipients.</p>
        <p>Injecting a sense of urgency into his dire warnings about Mr. Bush's plan, Mr. Gore argued that the proposal could have an almost immediate and negative impact by destabilizing the Social Security system, weakening the economy and reducing government resources for other programs, including Medicare.</p>
        <p>''You shouldn't be asked to play stock market roulette with your retirement savings in the Social Security program,'' Mr. Gore told several thousand people at a convention of AARP, an organization of people 50 and older. ''You shouldn't be left without retirement security if you do. And you should not have to foot the bill for others who do play and happen to lose, because some people would lose. The Bush plan raises all of these possibilities.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore also seized on remarks by Mr. Bush on Tuesday, when the Republican governor of Texas suggested that his proposal might be just a first step toward allowing workers to invest most or all of their payroll taxes.</p>
        <p>''What if people make poor choices?'' asked Mr. Gore, the Democratic Party's presumptive presidential nominee. ''What if the stock market dips right before an individual retires? Are individuals stuck with nothing?''</p>
        <p>Saying that Mr. Bush has not ruled out the possibility of future benefit cuts, Mr. Gore added, ''I don't think your Social Security should be up for grabs, and under my plan, it won't be.''</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Bush has not filled in many details of his proposal, its broad outline calls for allowing workers to invest in the markets part of the 12.4 percent payroll tax that finances Social Security benefits.</p>
        <p>The governor argues that allowing people to take advantage of Wall Street's historically strong returns could reduce the cost of retirement benefits and help extend the solvency of the system. Under current projections, Social Security will become insolvent by 2037, as more baby boomers retire.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore contends that the best way to strengthen the system is to use the Social Security surplus to pay down the national debt, and then devote the interest savings to the system. The plan, he says, would not only prolong Social Security's solvency until 2054, but also keep interest rates down and sustain the economic boom.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush argues that the Gore proposal, by failing to address Social Security's underlying problems, would inevitably lead to tax increases or benefit cuts to close future shortfalls in the system.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has sought to turn the Social Security debate into a broader issue of leadership style, asserting that Mr. Bush's ''irresponsible'' plan demonstrates that he would be an incompetent steward of the economy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush has also tried to make the debate as much about character as about policy, arguing that Mr. Gore has shown himself to lack credibility, consistency and vision on this and other issues.</p>
        <p>The Bush campaign hammered at that theme again today, releasing material from a White House Web site in which Mr. Gore is said to have supported a proposal last year by the Clinton administration to invest some Social Security money ''to achieve higher returns.''</p>
        <p>''Al Gore proposed allowing the federal government to invest in the stock market to save Social Security and now he's denying it,'' said Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for the Bush campaign.</p>
        <p>''Whether the issue is abortion, gun control, medical marijuana and now Social Security, Al Gore has a history of changing his position for political gain. That's why he has a problem with credibility.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's aides contend that the administration's proposal involved less risk than Mr. Bush's. And Mr. Gore himself says he grew wary of the plan after hearing debate on it.</p>
        <p>John Rother, director of legislation and public policy for AARP, said the organization, which represents 34 million people, had not taken a position on either candidate's plan. But he said AARP would almost certainly oppose any proposal that called for allowing workers to invest all of their payroll taxes.</p>
        <p>''What privatization means to me is that the risk is shifted entirely on to the individual instead of being shared broadly,'' Mr. Rother said. ''The whole point of Social Security is that it be something you can count on, where you are not at risk.''</p>
