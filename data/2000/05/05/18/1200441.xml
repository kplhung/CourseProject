        <p>Two large advertisers have named agencies to handle accounts.</p>
        <p>The Iomega Corporation has selected Publicis &amp; Hal Riney in San Francisco, part of Publicis S.A., to handle its account, with billings estimated at $30 million to $35 million.</p>
        <p>Mark Lucas, executive vice president for product management and global marketing at Iomega in Roy, Utah, said the decision came after a two-month review that had been narrowed to Publicis &amp; Hal Riney and five other agencies in the San Francisco area, including FCB Worldwide, part of True North Communications, and Saatchi &amp; Saatchi.</p>
        <p>Euro RSCG DSW Partners in Salt Lake City, part of the Euro RSCG Worldwide unit of Havas Advertising, had handled the Iomega account for 13 years until resigning in February.</p>
        <p>And the Consumer Healthcare Division of the Becton Dickinson Company in Franklin Lakes, N.J., named Bates USA in New York, part of the Bates Worldwide unit of the Cordiant Communications Group, to handle what was described as an exploratory consumer branding and integrated marketing assignment for its Ace brand of bandage products. Billings have not been determined.</p>
