        <p>Even on a cold, rainy spring day, the tourists find their way to the beach that made this resort so famous. Some of the restaurants perched on the dunes are full, their tables set below canvas roofs that flap in the blustery winds. Bleached-blond hunks hustle to park the Jaguar, Mercedes and Porsche convertibles that roll in.</p>
        <p>But behind the familiar scenes of this major French tourist attraction,  a fierce battle is going on for control of Pampelonne beach, which introduced Europe to topless sunbathing in the 1950's and where Roger Vadim set ''. . . And God Created Woman,'' starring Bridget Bardot.</p>
        <p>The crazy quilt of beach restaurants and loud clubs that sprang up illegally decades ago and that, some say, give St.-Tropez its aura of wild mischief and endless partying, may be in trouble. Environmentalists, fed up with what they see as greed so out of hand that beach strollers are forced to walk in the surf, have gone to court to clean things up.</p>
        <p>They have won two rulings proclaiming that Pampelonne -- which on a sunny day in July is a writhing sea of greased bodies -- is a ''remarkable natural preserve.'' If the designation sticks, virtually all construction here will become illegal. A ruling on a final appeal is expected in the next year.</p>
        <p>Even local officials who want some decorum returned to the beach do not want things to go that far.  Pampelonne, which officially belongs to St.-Tropez's inland neighbor, the village of Ramatuelle, produces much of the village's budget, provides 5,000 jobs and draws thousands of tourists to the area each year.</p>
        <p>Bruno Quivy, a spokesman for Ramatuelle, said the local councils would fight the suit. ''How can you say to 30,000 visitors a year, 'This goes back to nature'?'' Mr. Quivy said. '' 'No toilets. No parking. No food.' The case is deeply troubling. The environmentalists went too far.''</p>
        <p>The restaurant and club owners are, needless to say, equally unhappy. Removing them from the beach, said one restaurant owner, Patrice de Colmont, would do no less than destroy ''the image of France.''</p>
        <p>''I know that sounds pretentious,'' said Mr. de Colmont, who owns Le Club 55. ''But St.-Tropez is a part of the French image. St.-Tropez is  life -- men and women and all the weaknesses that make life. It is a strong symbol and one of youth and vitality.''</p>
        <p>The 36 businesses on the three-mile stretch of fine white sand run the gamut from a thatched Vietnamese restaurant to Mr. de Colmont's sprawling yacht-club-style dining room to the raucous and outrageous La Voile Rouge, owned by a former beach attendant, Paul Tomasselli, who readily admits he is dedicated to ''having fun, doing what you please.''</p>
        <p>Almost everyone involved in the tug of war over the beach agrees that the free-spirit feeling so long associated with Pampelonne beach should be preserved. Valerie Tronche, leader of the environmental federation that filed suit, acknowledges there is something ''magic'' about the activity there. She does not want it completely obliterated. But, she argues, the merchants have never been reigned in.</p>
        <p>''A few bamboo cabins have gotten bigger and bigger,'' she said, ''and they have sold off to each other, making a fortune. There has been an anarchy that the local officials have closed their eyes to. No one asked whether it was legal or not because they were making money.''</p>
        <p>When, in the early 1990's, the village started drawing up plans with the merchants for even bigger beach projects perched on concrete platforms along the beach, the environmentalists sprang into action. Under laws that govern the use of the French coastline, they challenged the construction of anything permanent on the beach.</p>
        <p>The most recent ruling in their favor, by a Marseille court last December, was immediately appealed. Ramatuelle has continued leasing out lots on Pampelonne, and business has been pretty much as usual. This year, however, an effort by Ramatuelle to do some self-policing and to close down La Voile Rouge drew the attention of the director of a federal department that oversees the region, Daniel Canepa.</p>
        <p>He announced he was annulling all the local annual contracts for beach-front establishments, saying they were illegal. But even this has not stopped beach operators from opening.</p>
        <p>In deciding not to renew its contract with La Voile Rouge, Ramatuelle called it a nuisance to the community. The possible demise of this 32-year-old hangout has made headlines all over France.</p>
        <p>The club brings in celebrities like Sylvester Stallone, Prince Albert of Monaco and Michael Douglas. But its noisy improvised shows, which have included slathering topless women with food and having a famous customer take over the mike, are not always deemed in good taste. Mr. Quivy said that the village had been flooded with complaints about noise and that it had concerns about the many other allegations, including drug use and a cash-only policy that many find suspicious.</p>
        <p>These days, Mr. Tomasselli seems a bit subdued. His lawyer has told reporters that ''removing restaurants from Pampelonne would be like banning waltzes in Vienna or beer in Munich.'' Mr. Tomasselli says the town wants him out so that a casino soon to be built can get a piece of the beach. That theory is getting a lot of ink here, though Mr. Quivy says there is no truth to it.</p>
        <p>Southern France has such a history of corrupt officials and quirky deals that no one has much trouble believing there is more than meets the eye on any municipal decision.</p>
        <p>In any case, Mr. Tomasselli hopes to have Ramatuelle's decision put aside by the courts so he can join in fighting the environmental suit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Canepa wants all parties to negotiate a compromise. With millions of dollars at stake, he believes that returning the beach to the wild would be foolish. On the other hand, he said, the beach restaurants have branched out aggressively and leave battered buildings and unsightly debris around during the off-season.</p>
        <p>Perhaps, he said, the environmentalists will be satisfied if the restaurants back away from the sea a bit and promise to put up only temporary structures that can be taken off the beach at the season's end, leaving it ''natural'' in the winter.</p>
        <p>''We will have to find a solution that is lawful,'' said Mr. Canepa. ''But takes into account the reality of the thing.''</p>
