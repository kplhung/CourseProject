        <p>The commencement ceremony at Columbia University offered evidence yesterday that it has become a convenient way station for those who want to change careers or pursue second passions.</p>
        <p>Among the 9,200 students taking degrees was Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland of Milwaukee, 73, who finally snatched his doctorate in musicology, almost 50 years after he started. He began working on his doctorate while he was a young Benedictine priest.</p>
        <p>Since then, he has become an archbishop, one noted for his maverick  stances in an increasingly conservative Roman Catholic hierarchy. He has headed bishops' committees on liturgy and social justice. And he has been awarded 36 honorary degrees.</p>
        <p>But convinced he still had a scholarly contribution to make, he asked the pope to grant him a six-month leave, and when he got it he finished a dissertation on ''The Office Antiphons of the Ambrosian Chant.'' (After the leave was over, he said, the rest was ''sheer drudgery.'')</p>
        <p>Then there was Mark Petrini, who was a classics professor at Columbia before he decided to become a physician, and signed up for pre-med classes while still teaching classics. Yesterday, at 46, he collected a medical degree.</p>
        <p>''When I turned 40, I decided that if I was ever going to do this, it was now,'' he said, adding that the biggest problem in being an older student was that ''the memory kind of fades.''</p>
        <p>Katherine and Kimberly Corp are 29-year-old identical twins with flowing red hair who took master's degrees in international and public affairs. They have also led split lives, mixing their academic work with a lifelong interest in dancing. They interrupted their master's studies for three years to work as Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall and in a musical touring company.</p>
        <p>They said they returned to complete their identical degrees because they liked to finish what they started  and because they thought it would help their careers. This summer,  they will start as news anchors on a new television program on the Web (YoNewYork.com) and will open their own Pilates-style exercise studio.</p>
        <p>Columbia gave honorary degrees yesterday to Judith Jamison, dancer and artistic director of Alvin Ailey Dance Theater; Robert Rubin, former secretary of the treasury; David Ho, director of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center and a professor at Rockefeller University; President Martti Ahtisaari of Finland; Paul A. Marks, physician and former president of Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center; and Oscar Schachter, Fish Professor Emeritus of International Law and Diplomacy at Columbia. Judge Rolando Tomas Acosta, Civil Court of the City of New York, received Columbia's Medal for Excellence.</p>
        <p>Donning a glittery pair of sunglasses in the shape of the year 2000, George Rupp, Columbia's president, saluted all of those who made up the first class to graduate in the 21st century, and then appealed to them to solve what he called the fundamental challenge of the world: the growing disparities in income and wealth.</p>
        <p>He said that 20 years ago, families in the top 5 percent of American households earned 10 times as much as those in the bottom 20 percent. Today, he said, that difference has increased to 19 times as much.</p>
        <p>He said that the disparities in the United States are more extreme than those in any other advanced industrial country, and are ''a remarkable state of affairs for a nation that has always prided itself on our egalitarian ethos.''</p>
        <p>''Markets alone do not provide adequate guidance in engaging this challenge,'' he said, adding that the nation ''must move away from a winner-take-all mindset.''</p>
        <p>After the ceremony, Mr. Rubin, the former treasury secretary, said that he agreed with Dr. Rupp, but had discovered in his six and a half years in Washington that it was hard to marshal resources to narrow the gap.</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately, it is not an issue that many people talk about,'' he said, ''and it is very difficult to coalesce public opinion and resources to solve it.''</p>
        <p>L.I.U., Brooklyn Campus</p>
        <p>Long Island University's Brooklyn Campus celebrated its 70th commencement yesterday morning as 814 undergraduate and 865 graduate students received degrees on the athletic field before dispersing into a crowd of friends and family wielding cameras, video recorders and large smiles.</p>
        <p>The university's president, David J. Steinberg, gave honorary degrees to William C. Thompson, New York City Board of Education president; William F. Baker, president of WNET (Channel 13); and Wendy Wasserstein, Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, who was not present to accept the degree.</p>
        <p>Dr. Thompson gave the commencement address, quoting the actress Helen Hayes by advising the students to aim for achievement and forget about success. ''You will be remembered for your achievements,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He noted the students who overcame adversity, like Rafal Proban, 22, a biology major from Bensonhurst, who was smuggled out of Mexico to the United States to join his mother in 1991. Last year, Mr. Proban, who worked as a fireman in the South Bronx, was awarded a medal for bravery by Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani for saving a man who jumped out of a window.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Mr. Proban said  he hoped ''to go on to medical school and save lives like my grandfather.'' His grandfather was a Pole who hid Jews in a chicken coop on his farm during the German occupation of Poland.</p>
