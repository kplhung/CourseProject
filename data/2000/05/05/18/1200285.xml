        <p>THE premature heat wave this month led many a homebody to think about spending time in the great outdoors. And because summer doesn't officially start until June, there's still plenty of time to find new twists on traditional patio paraphernalia.</p>
        <p>1. Colorful throw pillows made from vintage Vera scarves help create a summery look. These wool-backed pillows are made by Fig from scarves manufactured from 1949 to 1993. They come in many intense color combinations and in black and white. A 12-inch square is $150, an 18-inch square, $250, at Auto, 805 Washington Street (Horatio Street).</p>

        <p>THE premature heat wave this month led many a homebody to think about spending time in the great outdoors. And because summer doesn't officially start until June, there's still plenty of time to find new twists on traditional patio paraphernalia.</p>
        <p>1. Colorful throw pillows made from vintage Vera scarves help create a summery look. These wool-backed pillows are made by Fig from scarves manufactured from 1949 to 1993. They come in many intense color combinations and in black and white. A 12-inch square is $150, an 18-inch square, $250, at Auto, 805 Washington Street (Horatio Street).</p>
        <p>2. An inexpensive lightweight love seat, equipped with drink holders for two, can be unfolded on a small terrace or carried into a garden or the park. It collapses like an umbrella and fits into a slim carrying bag with a shoulder strap. The sling-style seat comes in green and white awning stripes, shown here, or blue and tan stripes. It is $29.95 at Kmart; for store locations: (800) 866-0086 or www.bluelight.com.</p>
        <p>3. The Flintstones aren't the only ones who like to entertain their guests with rock furnishings. And since these speakers function in rain or shine and come in three colors (gray, brown or white), they would look natural on neo- as well as paleo-patios. The speakers are $95 each at the Home Depot Expo Design Center, in Westbury, N.Y.; (800) 380-3976 or www.homedepot .com for other store locations and directions.</p>
        <p>4. A child-size wooden picnic table with attached benches (23 inches high, 32 inches wide and 35 inches long) can be used outdoors as well as in. The table, $395, is hand-painted in custom colors with lead-free paint; from a collection of children's furniture at the new TriBeCa outpost of Santa Monica-based Little Folk Art, 159 Duane Street (Hudson Street).</p>
        <p>5. The Yaddo chair is a handmade reproduction of a Victorian piece that has been on a porch at Yaddo, the artists' community in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., since it opened 100 years ago. Available in red, green, black or white, the chair is $700 from Jon Harris, a furniture maker in Fort Edward, N.Y., (518) 747-2521 or www.yaddochair.com.</p>
        <p>6. At first glance, this new English enameled tinware plate looks like 18th-century porcelain. A set of four 10-inch dinner plates, decorated with spring salad greens, is $24 and can be ordered from www.goodhome.com.</p>
