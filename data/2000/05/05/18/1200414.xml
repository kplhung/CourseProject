        <p>Discussions began here today on whether legal options exist to bring Foday Sankoh, the Sierra Leone rebel leader, to justice, because no international tribunal has automatic jurisdiction over him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sankoh, whose Revolutionary United Front established itself as one of the most brutal guerrilla movements -- chopping off citizens' limbs and destroying villages -- won a place in the Freetown government last year in return for an end to his violent campaign against President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.

        <p>Discussions began here today on whether legal options exist to bring Foday Sankoh, the Sierra Leone rebel leader, to justice, because no international tribunal has automatic jurisdiction over him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sankoh, whose Revolutionary United Front established itself as one of the most brutal guerrilla movements -- chopping off citizens' limbs and destroying villages -- won a place in the Freetown government last year in return for an end to his violent campaign against President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah. Thus, diplomats said, the responsibility is on Sierra Leone, which holds the rebel leader prisoner, to make the first decisions on his future.</p>
        <p>Will it try another reconciliation with the warlord, whose troops control diamond-mining areas, or will Mr. Sankoh be declared an outlaw and turned over to a criminal court?</p>
        <p>A key to Mr. Sankoh's future may be President Charles Taylor of Liberia, a beneficiary of diamonds supplied by the Sierra Leone rebels. Some officials in Sierra Leone say Mr. Taylor may have found an alternative rebel leader -- Mr. Sankoh's former field commander, Sam Bockarie -- and could jettison Mr. Sankoh.</p>
        <p>While awaiting a decision by Mr. Kabbah and fearful that threats of a war crimes trial could endanger some 270 United Nations hostages still held by rebels, many United Nations officials and human rights groups say Mr. Sankoh should not be absolved in any way.</p>
        <p>The United Nations, which was not involved in the peace agreement signed last year in Lome, Togo, took the unusual step of distancing itself publicly from the amnesty for Mr. Sankoh that was part of that accord. Secretary General Kofi Annan has said repeatedly throughout the current hostage crisis -- in which Mr. Sankoh's forces have held as many as 500 United Nations forces -- that the rebel leader would have to be held accountable.</p>
        <p>Reed Brody, advocacy director of Human Rights Watch, said governments were obliged to see Mr. Sankoh prosecuted. ''Once he is in international custody,'' Mr. Brody said, ''there is a duty under the Geneva Conventions to bring him to trial.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Brody, who has been active in efforts to try other leaders outside their countries, including Gen. Augusto Pinochet of Chile and Hissen Habre of Chad, said there were four possibilities in Mr. Sankoh's case.</p>
        <p>''One, probably the best, would be to create an international tribunal on the order of the tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda,'' he said. The other possibilities are creating a regional tribunal to handle the case, sending Mr. Sankoh to another country for trial or trying him in Sierra Leone, Mr. Brody said.</p>
        <p>''Normally it is better to try people in the country where their crimes were committed, where the victims are located, where justice would ultimately be more meaningful,'' Mr. Brody said. ''But given the unsettled conditions in Sierra Leone and the passions that are manifesting themselves in the calls by some for mob justice or lynch justice, it might be better to have him tried by a tribunal that is perceived to be neutral.''</p>
        <p>At the International Peace Academy, a research organization with close ties to the United Nations, the president, David Malone, said this was the kind of case for which an International Criminal Court had been created. But the court, which an international treaty established two years ago, is bogged down in negotiations over how it will function, with the United States demanding immunity for its citizens.</p>
        <p>Leading nations, Mr. Malone said, have not made the case against Mr. Sankoh clear enough to be heard in Freetown and among those United Nations officials, some working in Africa, who are inclined to patch up relations with the rebel leader.</p>
        <p>''The Security Council has consistently failed to telegraph clearly what its approach to Sankoh on criminal responsibility is going to be,'' Mr. Malone, a Canadian diplomat, said. ''The real dilemma is that there seems to be a split of opinion in United Nations circles on the Sankoh case. On the one hand, you have people who believe that somehow the Lome agreement needs to be put back together again and that in order to do so Foday Sankoh remains a necessary and legitimate partner.</p>
        <p>''I disagree. Foday Sankoh and his senior lieutenants need to be on notice that their personal responsibility for war crimes isn't abstract, that there will be practical consequences.''</p>
