        <p>The city's Department of Health created an instant sensation among food-crazed New Yorkers yesterday by inaugurating a Web site listing every blemish noted by inspectors at all licensed restaurants in the five boroughs.</p>
        <p>Given the number of city residents who treat jockeying for restaurant reservations like a blood sport, the site quickly clogged, unable to sustain the average 23,000 hits an hour it was getting by late afternoon.</p>
        <p>With a few clicks of the mouse, users could call up the latest inspections of the most expensive, most coveted tables in the city -- places like Le Bernardin or La Caravelle where a dinner for one is in the $70 range -- and read that they were cited for ''vermin or other live animal'' in their food storage, preparation or service areas.</p>
        <p>In general, restaurateurs supported the idea that the public had a right to know such details, but the one-size-fits-all categories prompted Gallic cries of dismay from numerous kitchens. Some chefs and owners at the city's elite restaurants expressed horror at the idea that what they called picayune infractions would be lumped together with problems at the corner greasy spoon.</p>
        <p>At Le Bernardin, inspectors found ''mice droppings in a single bag of flour,'' said Eric Ripert, the chef at the restaurant, which has been consistently rated by food bibles like Zagat as the best in New York. ''When we got that inspection we acknowledged it and we talked to our purveyor right away and they changed all the flour. I don't believe we have a mouse in the house.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ripert said that the restaurant's regular customers were unlikely to be deterred by the December 1999 inspection report, especially since the kitchens are open for visits by any customer who so desires. But he and other restaurateurs are concerned that the listings are not thorough or specific enough.</p>
        <p>Dr. Neal L. Cohen, the city's health commissioner, said that the information on the site would provide a snapshot of health conditions in each of the city's more than 18,000 restaurants. But he also acknowledged that the information was limited and potentially misleading.</p>
        <p>''It would be wrong to interpret any inspection report as a final grade for a restaurant,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, on the Health Department Web site, if a restaurant is cited for vermin or some other infraction, the word is highlighted so that clicking on it produces a glossary of the misdeeds. Vermin, for one, is defined as ''insect or small animal that is destructive, annoying, or harmful to health. Includes cockroaches, flies, and rats.''</p>
        <p>Rita Jammet, who with her husband, Andre, owns La Caravelle, says she was shocked by the word vermin from their July 1999 inspection. ''It's a very scary word; you see the word vermin and you think of all sorts of nasty animals crawling,'' she said.</p>
        <p>''The inspector found a fly!'' Mrs. Jammet added, noting that her restaurant is scrupulous about cleanliness. ''It was July. It was New York. It's the summer. Our food preparation areas are in the basement which we share with a hotel. There was construction. I am not trying to make excuses, but this is the reality of living in New York.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Jammet, like many others, suggested that the Health Department might want to adjust the wording so it would not seem quite so alarming. ''It's not my idea of a glamorous description, but in general I think it is a good thing they are doing,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cohen of the Health Department said the Web site would provide better consumer safeguards and a new incentive for restaurants to improve health standards. ''With this ease of access to information by the public, restaurant owners will no doubt aspire to even higher standards of public health safety and cleanliness,'' Dr. Cohen said.</p>
        <p>City rules require an unannounced inspection once each year, with more frequent visits where serious problems are found and not immediately corrected. The Web site lists only the latest inspection.</p>
        <p>The Web site (http://207.127.96.244 /webfood/search.htm) allows users to search for restaurants either by name or location, clicking on a map of each of the five boroughs.</p>
        <p>''I think this is the right thing to do,'' said Tim Zagat, the publisher of the renowned survey, but he added the city had to be vigilant to avoid repeating its past record of corruption.</p>
        <p>In a corruption scandal that erupted in 1988, when health inspection reports were routinely published by city newspapers, nearly 40 inspectors were eventually convicted of extorting money to falsify their reports and thereby minimize bad publicity for the restaurants.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cohen said safeguards instituted after the scandal, including varying which inspectors repeat visits to each restaurant, should prevent any such abuses.</p>
        <p>Restaurateurs said they thought the Web site might drive some customers away -- or at least increase their volume of questioning phone calls -- but over all would not dent the feverish attempts by New Yorkers to eat at the culinary hot spots of the moment.</p>
        <p>''I would eat off the floor of our restaurants; I wouldn't do that at my house, but I would do that in our restaurants,'' said Tracy Nieporent, marketing director for a group of trendy TriBeCa restaurants created by his brother Drew that includes  Nobu, Montrachet and Layla. Various restaurants in the group got citations for things like employees not using the approved utensils or the presence of food from a barred source like home canning.</p>
        <p>''Whenever they come by to inspect, they will find something,'' Mr. Nieporent said. ''If people want to scrutinize things, that is their right, but we stand behind what we do. I think people have to be realistic. You probably have a better chance of getting struck by lightening in Central Park than getting ill from any kind of food.''</p>
