        <p>Nothing explains Sherlock Holmes's ongoing appeal better than his own analysis of his detective work. ''It saved me from ennui,'' Holmes once said to his sidekick, Dr. Watson. ''Alas! I already feel it closing upon me. My life is spent in one long effort to escape from the commonplaces of existence. These little problems help me to do so.''</p>
        <p>When he's figuring out one of his little problems, the universe has focus and meaning. When he isn't solving mysteries, or fencing or boxing, he escapes by means of cocaine or his violin music, or he simply sinks into an existential torpor. His brilliant deductions are amusing, but it's the languor -- the hints of personal darkness -- that captivates.</p>
        <p>Over the last century numerous films and then television adaptations have been based on the Sherlock Holmes stories. Yet a new British series has found a clever way to capitalize on Holmes's popularity without trying to reinvent ''The Hound of the Baskervilles'' yet again. In fact, Holmes doesn't even appear in ''Murder Rooms: The Dark Origins of Sherlock Holmes,'' presented in two hourlong episodes tonight and next Thursday on ''Mystery,'' the PBS anthology.</p>
        <p>Perhaps taking its cue from ''Shakespeare in Love,'' ''Murder Rooms'' places the author -- in this case, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle -- at center stage and aims to satisfy our curiosity about the creative process with a dramatized version of reality.</p>
        <p>Conan Doyle might actually have approved of this fictionalized fact. As Holmes observes to Watson, in ''A Case of Identity'':</p>
        <p>''If we could fly out of that window hand in hand, hover over this great city, gently remove the roofs, and peep at the queer things which are going on, the strange coincidences, the plannings, the cross-purposes, the wonderful chains of events, working through generations, and leading to the most outre results, it would make all fiction with its conventionalities and foreseen conclusions most stale and unprofitable.''</p>
        <p>David Pirie's witty and intelligent script for ''Murder Rooms'' begins with the premise, promulgated by Conan Doyle himself, that Conan Doyle's mysteries were rooted in reality and that Holmes was modeled after Joseph Bell, a professor at the medical school in Edinburgh when Conan Doyle enrolled as his student in 1878. Bell was modestly famous for making extravagant (but often accurate) diagnoses divined as much from a patient's accent or clothing or occupation as from specific symptoms -- much the way Holmes would solve crimes. Apparently Bell also had a night job as a kind of forensic detective, using his powers of deduction to help the police unravel difficult cases. Conan Doyle became Bell's helper, his Dr. Watson.</p>
        <p>Buttressing these spare facts with considerable research about Victorian Edinburgh, and an obvious affinity for the Holmes stories, Mr. Pirie has imagined Conan Doyle's apprenticeship as a blueprint for his life as an author. Not incidentally, he has staged these events that could have fed Conan Doyle's imagination as a satisfying Sherlock Holmes story.</p>
        <p>Trailing after his mentor, Dr. Bell, the 19-year-old Doyle encounters the city's bottom-feeders (many of whom hold positions of prominence). Though young, he isn't innocent -- his own father, a disappointed artist, has drunk himself into madness. But Dr. Bell enlarges Conan Doyle's education further. Their investigations uncover gruesome examples of cruelty (a corpse whose ears have been severed) as well as less vivid but even more heartbreaking forms of loss.</p>
        <p>The superb Ian Richardson, who has played Sherlock Holmes (on HBO's version of ''The Hound of the Baskervilles'' and ''The Sign of Four''), expertly conveys a plausible prototype with his Dr. Bell. The real doctor may or may not have shared Holmes's quirks. We're privy only to the intelligence that Mr. Richardson uses to make his character as alluring as a man with steel-wool hair can be.</p>
        <p>As Arthur Conan Doyle, the young actor Robin Laing communicates sweetness and resoluteness in the face of hard sorrow, as well as offering a touch of self-pity that makes Conan Doyle all the more human.  The actors are generally good and mostly not well known, except for Charles Dance, playing aristocratic scum, a part he does well. His character pops up only briefly here and there, but like a cockroach skittering across a wedding cake, makes an impression.</p>
        <p>Shooting on location in Scotland, the filmmakers have made the streets and laboratories of their 19th-century Edinburgh seem Gothic and sinister, while the interiors -- where appropriate -- are warmly lit and elegantly Victorian. Jim Parker's sensitive score is lovely, especially the violin homages to Holmes.</p>
        <p>The director, Paul Seed (whose credits include the classic ''Masterpiece Theater'' mini-series ''House of Cards'') deftly maneuvers the action through the busy scenario Mr. Pirie has concocted. There are many crimes to contend with, of course, but also poignant relationships as well as sour ones, and even a dalliance with Big Issues (feminism, specifically, when Conan Doyle's female classmates are harassed). That's a lot to cover in two hours, but everyone manages very well.</p>
        <p>MYSTERY!  Murder Rooms: The Dark Origins of Sherlock Holmes  PBS, tonight  (Channel 13, New York, at 9)</p>
