        <p>Hoping to prod Republicans on gun control,  Democrats forced a symbolic vote today on a stalled bill to combat juvenile crime after tangling up the Senate with arcane parliamentary devices for two days and unleashing pent-up acrimony between the parties.</p>
        <p>The resolution, which does not carry the weight of law, passed by a hair-thin margin of 50 to 49. It urged Republicans immediately to pass the crime bill and an accompanying amendment that would require all sellers at gun shows to conduct background checks on buyers. Both measures have been stuck in the Congressional pipeline for eight months.</p>
        <p>Unwilling to stay silent on the issue, Republicans offered their own resolution, which accused the Clinton administration of failing to enforce existing gun laws and defended the rights of a ''citizen to own a firearm for any legitimate purpose.'' That passed 69 to 30.</p>
        <p>Although the resolutions were pure symbolism, nothing more than for-the-record suggestions, the action today comes at a politically opportune time for Democrats, who are pushing for stricter gun control.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, hundreds of thousands of people rallied on the Mall to voice support for gun control and, in a sign that the issue remains potent on the campaign trail, Gov. George W. Bush sought last week to fend off criticism that he is soft on guns by announcing a plan to provide trigger locks to gun owners in Texas.</p>
        <p>Sensing vulnerability, Republicans are reluctant to face another vote, no matter how symbolic, on gun control.</p>
        <p>The real war of words today took place immediately after the votes, when a fuming Senator Trent Lott of  Mississippi, the majority leader, attacked Democrats for accusing him of trying to stifle debate and for what he said was deliberately trying to thwart his efforts to move important appropriations bills.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lott said Democrats clogged up the Senate with countless unrelated measures and then ''they criticize us for not getting the work done.'' He added, sputtering with anger, ''That's smart, real smart.''</p>
        <p>Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, was able to force the gun issue to the Senate floor by using a loophole in new Senate rules. Republicans voted to close that loophole today.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Lott spoke, Mr. Daschle said Democrats were relegated to using parliamentary maneuvers to talk about gun control and other issues because they had no choice.</p>
        <p>Then, arms flailing, he accused Senator Lott of carrying out ''a version of dictatorship on the Senate floor'' and running the Senate, where debate is deliberately long and loosely structured, as if it were the House. Senator Lott's real motive, he said, was keeping politically difficult issues from coming to the floor.</p>
        <p>''The way the Senate is being run is wrong,'' Mr. Daschle said. ''No majority leader in history has attempted to constrain Senate debate as aggressively as Senator Lott has attempted to do. He is trying to protect his members so they don't have to vote on tough issues.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Daschle also threatened to make future trouble for Mr. Lott by further slowing Senate proceedings if the majority leader did not permit Democrats more leeway.</p>
        <p>The Senate passed the crime bill last May, with Vice President Al Gore casting a tie-breaking vote on the gun show amendment. But the the House passed a crime bill that  left out the gun show measure.</p>
