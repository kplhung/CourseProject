        <p>Voters in a Catskills school district that includes the town of Woodstock turned out in record numbers Tuesday, choosing a slate of school board candidates who want to  keep a tomahawk-wielding Indian as the mascot of the high school sports teams. The  school board, the district administration and some residents had complained that the Indian mascot is offensive.</p>
        <p>The debate has been so emotional that after the votes were counted Tuesday night at Onteora High School, a shoving match broke out in a hallway  between opposing board candidates and their supporters.  Yesterday, there were conflicting versions of who started the fight, what inflammatory comments were made and who collared whom.</p>
        <p>''The tension was very, very high,'' said Fred Perry, a corrections officer who won his first bid for the school board. ''The atmosphere was very gripping.''</p>
        <p>The election settled a question that has vexed the rural Onteora district since January, when the school board voted 4 to 3 to phase out the Indian mascot after the end of the school year. Tuesday's election was presented as a clear choice between three candidates who wanted to keep the Indian mascot and three opponents who viewed the mascot as a racist stereotype.</p>
        <p>The keep-the-Indian slate won by a ratio of almost two to one in each race. In addition, voters rejected the district's proposed $35.5 million budget.</p>
        <p>''Some have called it a referendum to bring back the Indian,'' said Hal Rowe, the district superintendent, whose anti-mascot stance prompted a petition signed by 700 residents calling for his removal.  ''It's probably the highest voter turnout we've ever had. This year we had almost 4,200 voters. That's about double what it was last year.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Perry, 38, who lives in a rural corner of Ulster County,  said his 2,408 to 1,765 victory over Donna Boundy of Woodstock was a triumph of four generations of Onteora graduates (the school opened in 1951) over ''outsiders.''</p>
        <p>''The community was upset by being called racist,'' Mr. Perry said. ''People were sad. It hit them hard. In 49 years, the team has never ever had a racial problem.''</p>
        <p>The new board members were sworn in right away, changing the board majority to 5 to 2 in favor of the Indian mascot. But the new board has no plans to change the anti-mascot policy just yet. In its first meeting, which is scheduled for next week, the board will be preoccupied with another task: revising the school budget so members can present it for another vote within a month.</p>
