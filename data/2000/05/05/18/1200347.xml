        <p>Fending off questions from shareholders at the annual meeting of the American International Group yesterday, Maurice R.

        <p>Fending off questions from shareholders at the annual meeting of the American International Group yesterday, Maurice R. Greenberg, its chief executive, said he would consider reversing the insider dominance of his board. But he would not budge on his designation of his son, Evan, as his eventual successor.</p>
        <p>''We're not going to go into that again,'' Mr. Greenberg said of his choice of his son as the next in line to run the company. ''That's been decided.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Greenberg, 75, announced the succession plan for A.I.G., one of the world's largest insurance companies, earlier this year while on a trip to China with his son, but he has said he has no plans to retire.</p>
        <p>In the meeting that lasted more than two hours, Mr. Greenberg said that until last year, when two insiders were added to the board as a result of an acquisition, independents had been in the majority and that that balance might well be restored ''at an appropriate time.''</p>
        <p>But when Brandon J. Rees, a researcher for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., asked Mr. Greenberg why the company did not simply endorse the A.F.L.-C.I.O.'s proxy proposal seeking an independent majority on the board, Mr. Greenberg replied:</p>
        <p>''Look, the board will decide at the appropriate time. We're not going to act on your proposal. We'll act when the board believes it should act.''</p>
        <p>Referring to the proxy proposal, Mr. Greenberg added: ''This is a democratic vote. If you get a majority vote, something will happen. If you don't, that's what won't happen.''</p>
        <p>There are now 10 A.I.G. employees, including Mr. Greenberg and his son on the board. Two other board members are A.I.G. consultants and six are independent. In 1998, A.I.G. had 17 board members; 9 of those were not employees, but 2 of them were consultants.</p>
        <p>During the meeting, Mr. Greenberg said it was ''an insult'' to suggest that directors who had consulting contracts with A.I.G. might vote along with management on issues that they did not personally endorse.</p>
        <p>Other shareholders raised questions about executive compensation, A.I.G.'s policies on employment opportunities and investments in projects in impoverished communities. But most of the several hundred shareholders -- many of them employees -- who crowded into A.I.G.'s Wall Street cafeteria for the meeting, clearly sided with Mr. Greenberg, who reported an 18.1 percent increase in earnings for last year and announced a 3-for-2 stock split as well as an 11 percent increase in the annual stock dividend.</p>
        <p>''There isn't another insurance company that has outperformed us,'' Mr. Greenberg said.</p>
        <p>On the question of executive pay, Mr. Greenberg -- who received $6 million in salary and bonuses last year plus stock options that compensation experts say are now worth about $4.5 million -- said that of the 800 best-paid chief executives, he ranked 176th, while A.I.G. ranked 17th among the companies in profits.</p>
        <p>Without directly addressing the issue of investments in poor communities, Mr. Greenberg said the Starr Foundation, named for the A.I.G. founder C. V. Starr, and headed by Mr. Greenberg, had made contributions ''in areas you discussed.'' As for employment practices, Mr. Greenberg said: ''We hire people on the basis of the best qualifications.''</p>
        <p>Toward the end of the meeting, Mr. Greenberg announced that the A.F.L.-C.I.O. proposal had received the support of 27 percent of the shareholders. A proposal by the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.) to establish an independent nominating committee for the board received a little more than 26 percent of the vote, up about 2 percentage points from the vote on the same question at last year's meeting.</p>
        <p>American International, which was founded in Shanghai, has pioneered the reopening of the insurance and financial services businesses in China. And Mr. Greenberg has been campaigning for Congressional approval of permanent normal trading relations with China. He bristled when a shareholder raised the question of human rights in China.</p>
        <p>''How many times have you been to China, my friend?'' Mr. Greenberg asked.</p>
        <p>''Zero,'' his questioner replied.</p>
        <p>''I've been going to China since 1975, several times a year,'' Mr. Greenberg said. ''The changes taking place in that country that affect human rights and rights in general are nothing short of astounding. It is like going to a new planet. People are living better today in China than at any time in their 5,000-year history.''</p>
        <p>One shareholder, who characterized Mr. Greenberg as ''a superguy,'' and said he would ''make you a five-star general'' if he had the authority, called for a salute to both father and son and the audience rose in a standing ovation.</p>
        <p>Elaborating on the choice of Evan Greenberg, 45, as his successor, Mr. Greenberg said that while he had recommended his son, the board had made the final decision.</p>
        <p>''Evan Greenberg is a 25-year veteran in A.I.G., and I can tell you that that decision was the right decision,'' the elder Mr. Greenberg said. ''My best interest is what's best for the company. And if I thought that it was Evan or Timbuktu or somebody from Buck Rogers, that's the person I would recommend.''</p>
