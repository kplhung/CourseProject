        <p>Foday Sankoh, the rebel leader who vanished nine days ago after dealing humiliating blows to the United Nations peacekeeping force in this West African country, was captured here today in a bizarre incident outside his abandoned house.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sankoh, who was last seen at his house shortly after his bodyguards killed 19 demonstrators outside the compound last week, returned this morning in the apparent hope of retrieving some possessions before turning himself in to the Nigerian Embassy, witnesses said.</p>
        <p>Instead, a local man reported Mr. Sankoh's presence to an armed supporter of the government, who shot the rebel leader in the leg and arrested him, witnesses said. Stripped naked, Mr. Sankoh was taken to a pro-government militia, which quickly turned him over to the government.</p>
        <p>Tonight, Mr. Sankoh, whose forces took 500 United Nations peacekeepers hostage early this month, was in  custody of Sierra Leone's government and was being protected by British paratroopers, United Nations and British officials said.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Sankoh's capture ended days of intense speculation about his whereabouts, it immediately raised the issue of what to do with him. Mr. Sankoh's forces are responsible for a wave of terror in 1998 and 1999 when they killed, raped and hacked off the limbs of thousands of citizens, but in recent days, the government had said that the rebel leader could take his place in the country's power-sharing government. A peace accord signed in July 1999 had said he would be permitted to be part of the government in exchange for ending his violent campaign against President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah. The accord also gave him amnesty for any violent acts committed before the signing.</p>
        <p>Officials did not say today what they planned to do with him. Because the amnesty does not apply to his most recent acts, many people inside and outside Sierra Leone want Mr. Sankoh, who repeatedly blocked the peace process, to face prosecution.</p>
        <p>The United Nations, which is trying to negotiate the release of 270 peacekeepers still held hostage by Mr. Sankoh's group, the Revolutionary United Front, reacted cautiously to the news. President Charles Taylor of Liberia, a longtime ally of Mr. Sankoh's, helped obtain the release of 139 peacekeepers early this week.</p>
        <p>The United Nations announced tonight that an additional 80 had been freed through Mr. Taylor's mediation. But it was not clear whether the release occurred before or after the news of Mr. Sankoh's capture, said David Wimhurst, the spokesman for the United Nations force here.</p>
        <p>Mr. Taylor's spokesman, Reginald Goodridge, said today that Mr. Sankoh's arrest could prove ''a stumbling block in the way of the release of further hostages,'' according to a Reuters report from Monrovia, the Liberian capital.</p>
        <p>British paratroopers engaged in combat for the first time since they arrived last week, initially to secure the evacuation of British citizens.  British officials said the paratroopers killed at least two rebels who started an overnight attack near the international airport in Lungi. The British, not part of the United Nations force, are officially here only to offer technical assistance to the peacekeepers, but their mission has been interpreted broadly on the ground.</p>
        <p>In addition, in the town of Port Loko, about 65 miles from here, Nigerian peacekeepers and pro-government soldiers fought for two hours against rebels, Mr. Wimhurst said. One Nigerian and six pro-government soldiers were killed in a firefight after rebels attacked with mortars and rocket-propelled grenades, Mr. Wimhurst said.</p>
        <p>Because of the delicate nature of Mr. Sankoh's status, neither government nor United Nations officials gave details on Mr. Sankoh's condition or where he might have been hiding in the last nine days. In late 1998, after the current government sentenced Mr. Sankoh to death for treason, rebels advanced desperately on the capital, where they eventually killed and maimed thousands.</p>
        <p>According to witnesses who were interviewed a couple of hours after Mr. Sankoh's capture and corroborated one another's accounts, the rebel leader showed up before dawn in a shantytown built on a hill behind his house. The house, on a hill in a neighborhood with other large homes, was looted after Mr. Sankoh's disappearance.</p>
        <p>Kabbah Sesay, a 36-year-old mason, said he had risen around 5:30 a.m. and left his house to attend morning prayers, when he was approached by Mr. Sankoh and a bodyguard.</p>
        <p>'' 'Do you recognize me?' '' Mr. Sankoh asked Mr. Sesay, the mason said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sesay, who recalled the events just after he had finished washing himself in an outdoor spring that local men use as a communal shower, said: ''They asked me if I could lead them to his house and find a taxi for him to take him to the Nigerian Embassy. So I told him, yes, I could do that for him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sesay said he then accompanied Mr. Sankoh and his bodyguard to the abandoned house and told them to wait under the stairs while he called a taxi. Instead, Mr. Sesay said he walked back to his shantytown and awakened a neighbor, Mustafa Kamara, who is a former soldier loyal to Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma, the leader of a junta that briefly held power in 1997 and is still the real power behind Sierra Leone's army.</p>
        <p>The two men returned to Mr. Sankoh's house. ''I went inside the compound and I told Foday Sankoh I've brought a taxi,'' Mr. Sesay said.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Sankoh and his bodyguard stepped outside, Mr. Kamara,  known as Black Scorpion, confronted them. When the bodyguard raised a gun, Mr. Kamara fired a single bullet that went through the bodyguard and  tore into Mr. Sankoh's left calf, Mr. Sesay said.</p>
        <p>''I'm a hero,'' said Mr. Kamara, who was greeted with cheers from his neighbors when he returned to the shantytown around 9 a.m. ''I'm happy, because I've suffered for 10 years,'' he said, alluding to the length of Sierra Leone's civil war, which began in 1991.</p>
        <p>Puddles of blood lay near the house this morning. Inside, members of another militia, the Kamajors, were searching the house.</p>
        <p>Like most people in the area, two militiamen, Elisha Sheaka, 28, and Julius Mbayo, 29, said they believed that Mr. Sankoh had hidden diamonds in the house and wanted to retrieve them before turning himself in at the Nigerian Embassy.</p>
        <p>''That's why we are here on the ground,'' Mr. Sheaka said. ''Otherwise, I see no reason why Pa Sankoh left the bush and came here.'' After his capture, the locals pounced on him and stripped him of all his clothes, witnesses said.</p>
        <p>''We take everything,'' said Foday Sesay, who said he was a member of Colonel Koroma's force. ''We even took his hair dress.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Sesay then produced a green-and-white hat in the style that Mr. Sankoh usually wore. Others showed a towel and a letter that they said Mr. Sankoh was carrying.</p>
        <p>By all accounts, Mr. Sankoh was  put into a white Land Rover by Colonel Koroma's men and taken to the former junta leader, who had been allied with Mr. Sankoh from 1997 until last year.</p>
        <p>A picture taken by a local photographer shows Mr. Sankoh, naked from the waist up, jammed in the Land Rover with several young men. One man is grabbing Mr. Sankoh, whose face is dirtied, by the skin of his neck. ''He was brought into this compound, naked, because the public wanted his neck,' said Prince Nicol, Colonel Koroma's spokesman.</p>
        <p>After about half an hour at Colonel Koroma's, Mr. Sankoh was taken to the Sierra Leonean Army's headquarters. From there, the British took him in a helicopter to what they described as a secure location.</p>
        <p>''We never wanted him to be part of the government,'' said Sidikie Gassama, 46, who lives in the shantytown near Mr. Sankoh's house. ''We only did that because we wanted peace.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gassama said his daughter, Mariama, was one of the 19 killed outside Mr. Sankoh's house last Monday. He expressed an opinion that many in Freetown were voicing today: ''They should put him in a cage to be exposed to the public,'' Mr. Gassama said of Mr. Sankoh, ''and to be fed like any animal in the jungle.''</p>
