        <p>P. J. Brown could sense that things were right with the Miami Heat again when Tim Hardaway began scoring tonight, and never mind that sprained left foot that has limited him.</p>
        <p>''He looked like the Timmy of old,'' Brown, the power forward, said after the Heat dispatched the Knicks, 87-81, before 20,021 at American Airlines Arena. ''He's our leader, our catalyst. He's a coach and player on the floor. What he did tonight was a big-time lift. I was saying: 'That a way, man. Do your thing.' ''</p>

        <p>P. J. Brown could sense that things were right with the Miami Heat again when Tim Hardaway began scoring tonight, and never mind that sprained left foot that has limited him.</p>
        <p>''He looked like the Timmy of old,'' Brown, the power forward, said after the Heat dispatched the Knicks, 87-81, before 20,021 at American Airlines Arena. ''He's our leader, our catalyst. He's a coach and player on the floor. What he did tonight was a big-time lift. I was saying: 'That a way, man. Do your thing.' ''</p>
        <p>Just as it appeared that Alonzo Mourning would have to provide the impetus for the Heat to be successful against the Knicks, Hardaway stepped into the breach tonight. Averaging just 6.3 points coming into this game, he finished with 12 points, including 10 in a whirlwind third quarter.</p>
        <p>''I know the Knicks like to come out real aggressive in the third quarter,'' he said, ''so I figured that was the time to push the foot. I had had three days' rest. Why not push it to the limit?''</p>
        <p>The foot ached all the time, Hardaway said, as he helped the Heat carry a 4-point lead into the final quarter, and then turned over the point guard chores to the rookie Anthony Carter.</p>
        <p>''I've learned to hide it,'' Hardaway said of the pain. ''After playing on it for some-odd days now, you get used to it. It's like part of my body now.''</p>
        <p>Hardaway said he felt maligned because so many people seemed to discount him in this series.</p>
        <p>''I take it personally when people talk about me not having it,'' he said. ''That's just me. Some people don't understand what it's all about. I just know me. When I'm right, nobody can stop me.''</p>
        <p>The Heat had other heroes on this night, like Clarence Weatherspoon and Dan Majerle. Before Hardaway regained some of his old form, Weatherspoon, who has been largely ineffective with the much taller Marcus Camby defending him, came through with 6 first-half points and 6 rebounds to help the Heat overcome an early deficit and take a 41-35 lead.</p>
        <p>''They've been smart in putting a long, athletic player on me,'' Weatherspoon said. ''But I had to keep digging, keep looking for angles to get to the basket.''</p>
        <p>Majerle, 34, the Heat's second-oldest player, came through in the fourth quarter, just after Mourning's departure at 7 minutes 36 seconds with his fifth foul. He made a pair of 3-point shots and had a 3-point play.</p>
        <p>''One of those 3-pointers came from another ZIP code, I think,' Mourning said. ''You talk about clutch shooting.''</p>
        <p>Bruce Bowen, scooped up off waivers, added a dagger of his own -- a 3-point shot late in the game that restored the Heat lead to 6 points after a 4-point run by the Knicks.</p>
        <p>''I saw Patrick closing out on me, but I knew I had time to get the shot off,'' Bowen said, referring to Ewing, the Knicks' center. ''It felt good when it left my hands, but I've had shots that felt good before and didn't go in.''</p>
        <p>Miami's five 3-pointers in the game were two more than the Knicks had.</p>
        <p>''Our guys still have those hot trigger fingers, so they keep putting them up,'' Brown said. ''When we penetrate and kick the ball out and hit those shots, we're hard to beat.''</p>
        <p>Coming into this game, it was expected that Mourning would be the spring from which all good things came. He wasn't. He missed his first five shots and wound up making 5 of 17. He finished with 18 points, 5 rebounds and 4 blocked shots.</p>
        <p>''I've said we need help from everybody if we're going to move on, and tonight showed that,'' Mourning said.</p>
        <p>Mourning feels the Heat must control at least two of these three areas to prevail in the series: rebounding, number of turnovers and what he called the ''effort department.''</p>
        <p>Heading into tonight, Miami led in rebounds, the Knicks had fewer turnovers, and there had been no clear winner in effort, which he described as ''those little things that you don't keep statistics for, but win games.''</p>
        <p>That form held up again tonight. But Mourning did not mention scoring balance. Miami had more of it tonight than in any game of this series.</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>PAT RILEY was contrite Wednesday about his use of the word ''Gestapo'' in a news conference Tuesday to jokingly describe the force the Heat should use in converting transplanted New Yorkers to Heat fans. ''It was a stupid comment on my part,'' Riley said. ''All of us that were in here when I tried to make light of that whole situation -- I used a word that obviously nobody can relate to in any kind of a good context. So it was just a stupid comment on my part.''</p>
