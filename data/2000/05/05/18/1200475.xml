        <p>A union representing 9,300 workers at Consolidated Edison and three other New York power companies announced yesterday that its members have authorized a strike if a new contract is not reached before the current agreement expires at 12:01 a.m. on June 25.</p>
        <p>Officials with Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers of America said that 94 percent of the union members who had voted authorized a strike against Con Ed and three other companies that are providing New Yorkers with power as part of the deregulation of the industry: KeySpan Energy, Orion Power Holdings and the NRG Energy unit of Northern States Power.</p>

        <p>A union representing 9,300 workers at Consolidated Edison and three other New York power companies announced yesterday that its members have authorized a strike if a new contract is not reached before the current agreement expires at 12:01 a.m. on June 25.</p>
        <p>Officials with Local 1-2 of the Utility Workers of America said that 94 percent of the union members who had voted authorized a strike against Con Ed and three other companies that are providing New Yorkers with power as part of the deregulation of the industry: KeySpan Energy, Orion Power Holdings and the NRG Energy unit of Northern States Power.</p>
        <p>Union officials said the negotiations might prove difficult because this was the first set of negotiations conducted under new state deregulation laws aimed at bringing more competition to providing electricity.</p>
        <p>The union, which represents meter readers, linemen, transmission workers, manhole workers and others, last went on strike in 1983. The union's workers provide service in Manhattan, Queens, Brooklyn, the Bronx and Westchester County.</p>
