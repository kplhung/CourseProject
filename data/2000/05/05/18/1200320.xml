        <p>The family-oriented Pax television network announced a fall schedule yesterday that expands its lineup of original shows, with a little help from its newest partner, NBC.</p>
        <p>Pax executives said they were adding three new programs to the prime-time schedule on Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays this fall, with a fourth new show to follow in the winter.</p>
        <p>One new show, an hourlong drama called ''Mysterious Ways,'' was originally developed for NBC, which rejected it. It is scheduled to run on Tuesdays at 8 p.m. and again on Saturdays at 10 p.m. The program chronicles the adventures of a professor of anthropology who investigates seemingly supernatural human feats. ''Encounters With the Unexplained,'' scheduled to be shown on Mondays at 8 p.m., and again on Sundays at 7 p.m., will feature investigative reports focusing on the great mysteries of the world. ''The Rumfords,'' an animated program about a cartoon family living in the real world, will run on Fridays at 8 p.m.</p>
        <p>An hourlong drama about a country doctor who moves to New York City, starring Billy Ray Cyrus, the country music star, is expected to be added to the network's schedule in the winter.</p>
        <p>Executives said they would continue showing repeats of ''Twenty One,'' the NBC game show whose host was Maury Povich and that was recently removed from the NBC schedule.</p>
        <p>They said they might produce new episodes. And they said they were working on agreements with NBC stations in order to run repeats of local news shows on Pax stations and the ''Nightly News'' with Tom Brokaw.</p>
