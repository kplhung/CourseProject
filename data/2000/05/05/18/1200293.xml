        <p>SNOB that I am, I never thought I would consider buying a Norman Rockwell collector's plate.</p>
        <p>Of course, I never thought that I would consider buying something from a pawnbroker, either. Until last week, in fact, my knowledge of the profession was limited to the movies.  If you ever want to feel really hopeless for two hours, find a video of  ''The Pawnbroker,'' with Rod Steiger. In the title role, Mr. Steiger conducts business from behind the metal bars of a security cage as desperate, lonely customers offer him their meager possessions -- cheap candlesticks, an old radio, a wristwatch -- in exchange for quick cash.</p>

        <p>SNOB that I am, I never thought I would consider buying a Norman Rockwell collector's plate.</p>
        <p>Of course, I never thought that I would consider buying something from a pawnbroker, either. Until last week, in fact, my knowledge of the profession was limited to the movies.  If you ever want to feel really hopeless for two hours, find a video of  ''The Pawnbroker,'' with Rod Steiger. In the title role, Mr. Steiger conducts business from behind the metal bars of a security cage as desperate, lonely customers offer him their meager possessions -- cheap candlesticks, an old radio, a wristwatch -- in exchange for quick cash.</p>
        <p>I have to say that none of that misery was evident last week on Pawnbroker.com, a new site that acts as an online clearinghouse for the wares of about 600 pawnshops across the country. With its clean interface, straightforward query box for searches and inventory of 75,000 items organized into 10 categories, the site looks as sanitized as any other used-goods emporium online. But you can understand why I shied away from anything resembling candlesticks, radios or wristwatches as I examined the merchandise.</p>
        <p>As in a typical pawnshop, much of the merchandise fell into the category of Jewelry/Gemstones, with thousands of rings, watches and necklaces at prices ranging from a few dollars to $125,000 for an emerald-cut diamond. The category with the smallest selection was Vehicles, which last week consisted of three motorcycles with asking prices ranging from $3,500 to $30,000.</p>
        <p>One difference: unlike most offline pawnshops, Pawnbroker.com sells no firearms.</p>
        <p>I found the Norman Rockwell plate under Antiques/Collectibles/Art. Issued as a limited edition plate titled ''Santa's Golden Gift'' to commemorate Christmas 1987, it was on sale for $30.95 (negotiable).</p>
        <p>What tempted me was not the apple-cheeked Santa. No, I was thinking more of the investment possibilities. After years of being scorned by the art establishment, Rockwell's wholesome freckles-and-pigtails style is suddenly on the verge of becoming trendy. Last fall, a national exhibition of his paintings and Saturday Evening Post covers began traveling to art museums in major cities. I figured that before the exhibition reaches the Guggenheim Museum next year, it might be wise to snap up a plate at pre-Manhattan prices.</p>
        <p>As I read the item's description (''plate measures about 8 inches across''), it seemed I didn't have much to lose. Where else was I going to put my money last week, tech stocks? And if I guessed wrong, I could always serve dinner on the plate and plop some mashed potatoes on Santa's twinkly eyes.</p>
        <p>I was about to click on the button that said Negotiate, which would prompt a software program to dicker with me within price limits set by the pawnbroker who owned the plate. But I hesitated, considering the tragedy of the person who had pawned the plate in exchange for quick cash, back in the days before it was O.K. to like Norman Rockwell.</p>
        <p>Would I be profiting from someone else's misfortune? To find out, I phoned Pawnbroker.com's chief executive, Neil McElwee.</p>
        <p>''You, unfortunately, are suffering from the same Hollywood-based stereotype as the rest of the 90 percent of the public that doesn't go into a pawnshop,'' Mr. McElwee said. ''In September, we did focus groups all around the country, where we tested attitudes and found all of the stereotypes. People said they were afraid of being ripped off, afraid of what would happen if a neighbor sees me.''</p>
        <p>For 3,000 years, pawnbrokers have had to combat those prejudices, Mr. McElwee said. ''But what is unique about the pawnbroker model, how it works, is that it provides a service. The pawnbroker gets merchandise from people who really were looking for short-term loans because they have to pay the taxes or something. Seventy to 80 percent of those items are reclaimed.''</p>
        <p>No money for taxes? The more I heard, the sadder it sounded.</p>
        <p>Mr. McElwee assured me that focus group participants softened their attitudes after they heard about the good deals available on Pawnbroker.com -- he said the site generally sold items for no more than 40 percent of their retail value.</p>
        <p>But I decided to look around for another source of Rockwell plates.  Faster than you could say, ''Is that a real Richard Diebenkorn painting?'' I found ''Santa's Golden Gift'' for sale on eBay.</p>
        <p>In fact, I found a number of identical listings on eBay: for a camera, binoculars and a harmonica. Each sold for less than the asking price on Pawnbroker.com (on eBay, the Rockwell plate sold for $6.50).</p>
        <p>For all I knew, the eBay listings could have been for the same items as the ones on Pawnbroker.com.</p>
        <p>''Pawnbrokers are selling everything under $50 that they can possibly post on eBay,'' Mr. McElwee said. ''But they have a devil of a time selling anything over $150 because in a consumer-to-consumer model like that, you have no idea whether what you are buying is authentic.''</p>
        <p>Unlike eBay's ''buyer beware'' policy, which the online auction company overrode last week in canceling the notorious $135,805 sale of an abstract painting that may or may not have been the work of the artist Richard Diebenkorn, Pawnbroker.com offers some insurance. Buyers can get a refund for up to 10 days after receiving a purchased item in the mail, no questions asked, Mr. McElwee said. That's plenty of time to seek an appraisal from, say, a qualified Rockwell plate expert.</p>
        <p>So where did I buy the plate? After seeing the lackadaisical bidding on eBay, I passed it up because I decided, in the end, that buying tech stocks might be a better investment. However, I am seriously considering another item on Pawnbroker.com: the Franklin Mint's medal for the inauguration of President Richard M. Nixon and Vice President Spiro T. Agnew in 1973. It's $199.</p>
