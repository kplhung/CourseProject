        <p>With sales of its signature soups on the wane, the Campbell Soup Company said yesterday that its third-quarter earnings fell 14 percent, and warned that the rest of its fiscal year, which ends in July, was unlikely to be much better.</p>
        <p>Speaking at a meeting with analysts in New York, Campbell's president and chief executive, David Johnson, acknowledged the company's dismal performance, but insisted that it could fix the problems. ''We are not paralyzed; we are moving forward,'' Mr. Johnson said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson came out of retirement to replace Dale F. Morrison, who resigned in March after less than three years in Campbell's top job. Under Mr. Morrison, Campbell struggled to improve its soup business, which accounts for half of the company's earnings. At the same time, sales of its Pepperidge Farm cookies and crackers boomed, and a new product, V8 Splash, enjoyed brisk sales.</p>
        <p>In the most recent quarter, however, soup was not the only culprit. The company said yesterday that Pepperidge Farm's earnings declined in the quarter, mainly because of marketing for its Goldfish crackers. V8 Splash also declined, pulling down earnings in the company's beverage division. Sales of Pace salsa also fell, the company said. For the quarter, earnings fell to $139 million, or 32 cents a diluted share, from $162 million, or 37 cents, a year earlier.</p>
        <p>One of the few bright spots came from one of the company's smallest divisions -- Godiva Chocolatier, which had solid sales because of Valentine's Day and Easter.</p>
        <p>Some industry experts have said that soup sales are down because people these days do not have the time or inclination to prepare it, a theory Campbell's executives have gone to great lengths to counter. At the meeting, Mr. Johnson announced plans to build up Campbell's soup business by bringing out new products and repackaging some old ones. These include putting pull-off lids on soups that are marketed as ''ready to serve'' to make the cans easier to open, and making some additional flavors in the ready-to-serve package, including minestrone.</p>
        <p>One analyst voiced concern about how the new products would affect the company's profits. ''It will make the packaging more expensive, and they said they are not going to raise prices,'' said Nomi Ghez, a Goldman, Sachs analyst, who estimated the additional cost at 2 cents to 3 cents a can. She added that putting more kinds of Campbell's soup on the grocery shelf might draw business away from existing Campbell's products. ''It is likely to be cannibalistic,'' she said, ''and the ready-to-serve soups are lower-margin than the condensed soups.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson also said the company would pursue strategic initiatives, including acquisitions, to improve sales. ''He said he won't just combine with someone to get synergies,'' Ms. Ghez said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson gave no details about which companies Campbell might be considering. But one possibility is H. J. Heinz, which makes private-label soup that competes with Campbell's brands.</p>
        <p>Seeking strength in scale, many large food companies are considering partnerships of various kinds, with Nabisco Group Holdings on the block and Unilever actively courting Bestfoods.</p>
        <p>''You have a lot going on in the back room, but when they get to the front room, they can't talk about it,'' said John R. McMillin, a Prudential Securities analyst.</p>
        <p>Mr. Johnson is respected by Wall Street for his record at Campbell, where he was president for seven years before turning the reins over to Mr. Morrison. In the old days, Mr. Johnson would don a cape and call himself Souperman to inspire his employees. Yesterday, he appeared subdued and serious, but insisted that Campbell could resolve its issues and improve performance.</p>
        <p>''In the meeting, it became clear that next year is going to be a transition year and not great, either,'' said Ms. Ghez, who reduced her earnings expectations for 2001 by 5 cents, to $1.75, which is scant improvement on the $1.65 expected this year.</p>
        <p>''They are addressing the big brands with some innovation, and with good management, at least the precipitous decline of the business can be stemmed,'' she added. ''The question is, can they get it to grow?''</p>
