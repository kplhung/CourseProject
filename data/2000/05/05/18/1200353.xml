        <p>Although there is no military draft, young men are required by law to register for the draft at age 18, but there has been a steady decline in compliance in recent years, the government said today.</p>
        <p>Just 88 percent of young men have registered, with compliance ranging from 95 percent in New Hampshire to 73 percent in Hawaii.</p>
        <p>Lewis C. Brodsky, the draft system's director of public and Congressional affairs, said it was unknown  why compliance rates varied so widely. He suggested that low population density might contribute to compliance, with New Hampshire and Maine at the top of the registration chart, but that would not account for the low showing of other states with low population densities like Kentucky and Mississippi.</p>
        <p>Another possibility is that large numbers of immigrants may contribute to low registration. That holds true for California and Texas, which have many immigrants and low compliance, but New York and Florida, with high immigrant populations, have higher compliance.</p>
        <p>At a news conference called to announce the start of a campaign to increase the registration rate, Gil Coronado, the Selective Service director, emphasized that his agency did not provide names to the Immigration and Naturalization Service.</p>
        <p>Young men living in the United States, whether here legally or illegally, are required to register for the draft, and they are not asked their citizenship, Mr. Coronado said.</p>
        <p>The government regards registration as an insurance policy of sorts. If war came, men could be drafted faster if they are registered.</p>
        <p>Following are the states the agency gave an A on a report card of draft registration compliance, with the percentage of eligible men enrolled:</p>
        <p>New Hampshire (95), Maine (93), North Dakota (93), Iowa (91), Nebraska (91) and Minnesota (90).</p>
        <p>Those with a B:</p>
        <p>South Dakota (89), Vermont (89), West Virginia (89), Arkansas (88), Indiana (88), Wyoming (88), Idaho (87), Oklahoma (87), Rhode Island (87), Utah (87), Montana (86), New Jersey (86), Washington (86), Kansas (85), Ohio (85), Tennessee (85), Wisconsin (85), Alabama (84), Alaska (84), Colorado (84), Connecticut (84), District of Columbia (84), Florida (84), Illinois (84), Massachusetts (84), Missouri (84), Nevada (84), North Carolina (84), Oregon (84), Virginia (84), Delaware (83), Arizona (82), Michigan (82), New York (82), Pennsylvania (82), New Mexico (81) and Maryland (80).</p>
        <p>Those with a C: California (79), Georgia (79), Kentucky (79), Mississippi (79), South Carolina (79), Texas (77), Louisiana (74) and Hawaii (73).</p>
        <p>Jerry Bachman, a social psychologist at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michigan, who has studied the draft, said in an interview: ''The idea of registering for the draft, I suppose, is lost on them with increased distance from the actual use of the draft.''</p>
        <p>The last draftee was inducted in 1973 and the highest level of registration since then was 97.7 percent in 1991.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coronado said criminal penalties for not registering were rarely imposed, the last case coming in 1985. Men who do not register are ineligible for many federal benefits, including student loans, job training and government jobs, and immigrants are barred from citizenship.</p>
        <p>Mr. Coronado said that the failure to register was probably caused by a growing lack of awareness of the requirement and that it meant that there was a risk of ''inadvertently creating a permanent underclass of men.''</p>
