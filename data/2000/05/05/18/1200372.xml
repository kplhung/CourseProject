        <p>The Ford Motor Company said today that it would produce fewer Ford Excursion sport utility vehicles during the 2001 model year, but attributed the cutback to weak consumer demand for the vehicle rather than the company's concerns about its safety and environmental problems.</p>
        <p>George Pipas, a Ford spokesman, said that the automaker would cut its production rate for the Excursion to 52,000 a year this summer, from 69,000 a year now. By building 17,000 fewer Excursions, Ford will be able to build 35,000 more Ford Super Duty pickup trucks, which are produced on the same assembly line in Louisville, Ky., he said.</p>
        <p>Ford had only a 45-day supply of Super Duty pickups at the end of April, compared with a 100-day backlog of Excursions. Automakers like to have a 60-day supply of vehicles on dealership lots and in transit to dealerships at any given time, so that each dealer can offer a selection of vehicles in different colors and with different equipment.</p>
        <p>''We're not a company that our No. 1 goal is to shove sport utilities down the throats of consumers'' by offering deep discounts, Mr. Pipas said. Because the $40,000 Excursion and $30,000 Super Duty share the same engines and transmissions and have similar fuel economy, the shift in production will have little if any effect on the environment, he added.</p>
        <p>Taller than Michael Jordan and weighing as much as three Honda Civics, the Excursion gets only 10 miles to the gallon in the city and 13 on the highway, making it the target of heavy criticism from environmentalists. In a ''corporate citizenship report'' released last Thursday in Atlanta at Ford's annual shareholders' meeting, the automaker acknowledged the criticism and quoted the Sierra Club's condemnation of the vehicle as, ''a rolling monument to environmental destruction.''</p>
        <p>William C. Ford Jr., Ford Motor's chairman, said in an interview at the meeting that the company planned to continue making the vehicle because a halt in production would prompt the introduction of similar vehicles by rival automakers with less commitment to safety and the environment. Ford voluntarily builds the Excursion to emit less pollution than  regulations allow for sport utilities. The Excursion is also equipped with impact-absorbing steel bars below the bumpers.</p>
