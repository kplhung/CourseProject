        <p>ROCKEFELLER-Rodman C. The Trustees and Staff of The Museum of Modern Art and its International Council and staff are deeply saddened by the passing of Rodman C. Rockefeller, our longtime friend and colleague. Rodman served on the Board of the Museum from 1989 to 1996, was an active member of the Council since 1982, and a member of the Museum's Committee on Prints and Illustrated Books from 1990 to 1993. Rodman's abiding interest in Latin America was particularly exemplified in his commitment to contemporary art and cultural exchange, and he contributed greatly to the Museum's programs in those areas. We extend our deepest sympathy to his wife, Sascha and his children, Meile, Peter, Stuart, and Michael, and his grandchildren. Ronald S. Lauder, Chairman Agnes Gund, President Glenn D. Lowry, Director The Museum of Modern Art, NY Brian Urquhart, Chairman Jo Carole Lauder, President The International Council of The Musuem of Modern Art</p>
        <p>ROCKEFELLER-Rodman C. The board and staff of Metro International mourn the death of Rodman C. Rockefeller, a good friend to our organization and the recipient of our 1998 Fulbright Award for Contribution to International Educational Exchange. His generous support for international education and his powerful advocacy on behalf of the Fulbright Program leave a lasting legacy, for which we will long remain grateful. Andrea Nemetz, Chair Margaret Shiba, Executive Director</p>
        <p>ROCKEFELLER-Rodman C. The Board of Trustees of New School University notes with sadness the passing of Rodman C. Rockefeller. During his 22 years as a Trustee and Life Trustee he vigorously encouraged this institution's international interests and its consolidation as a major urban university. John L. Tishman Chairman of the Board Philip Scaturro Chancellor New School University</p>
