        <p>A game of chicken between Nassau County and the union representing its police officers continued today as county officials gave the union yet another deadline by which to decide whether to accept a so-called lag payroll.</p>
        <p>The payroll deal -- in which the cash-starved county seeks to withhold two weeks' pay from all workers until they end their employment -- has been accepted by every union representing county workers except one, the Police Benevolent Association. The unions were told in December that if they did not agree to the plan, they would face layoffs.</p>
        <p>After the police union balked, the county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, made the politically risky move last month of announcing that he would lay off 207 police officers. But he cannot carry through on the threat without the support of the County Legislature, which has been reluctant to lay off the officers while the union continues to negotiate.</p>
        <p>This week the county, in a letter from its lawyers to the union, said that ''time has run out'' and that the union must announce its decision by Monday evening.</p>
        <p>If it does not, the letter says, the county may interpret its silence as a waiver of the union's right to put the payroll proposal before its members. Then the county could try to impose the lag payroll even if it was not ratified by a vote.</p>
        <p>That option would save the county from going ahead with layoffs.</p>
        <p>Gary DelaRaba, the president of the police union, said today that the union would be ready with an answer for the county by Monday.</p>
        <p>County officials said that negotiations had broken down because the union sought guarantees against future layoffs beyond those that the other unions had received.</p>
