        <p>Al Leiter remembers how it feels to pitch without confidence.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes it slips away, and you're not the aggressor,'' said Leiter, the Mets left-hander. ''You're not confident. You're in a bad game and stuff's happening, you're on the rubber, you're not thinking about your next pitch or what you want to do. You look in, you wind up, and you have no idea.''</p>
        <p>That is how it was for Leiter early last season. He signed a four-year, $32 million contract the previous winter, and he was pressing, trying to justify the money. One poor performance would linger into his next game. Leiter believes momentum is everything, and he had only the wrong kind.</p>
        <p>Through eight starts last year, Leiter was 0-4 with a 6.12 earned run average. Through eight starts this year, he is 5-0 with a 3.24 E.R.A. The Mets have won whenever he pitches, and they did again last night with a 4-2 victory over the Colorado Rockies at Shea Stadium that kept them from dropping below .500.</p>
        <p>Leiter worked eight innings last night, allowing five hits and two runs, walking two with nine strikeouts. Manager Bobby Valentine said Leiter had the look he had last October when he pitched the Mets into the playoffs by shutting out Cincinnati. ''Very reassuring,'' Valentine said.</p>
        <p>Leiter has been especially effective pitching out of the stretch. He has allowed hitters only a .173 average with runners in scoring position, and he credits an aggressive mentality with helping him escape jams. Early last year, his aggressiveness often turned into a problem.</p>
        <p>''I was searching,'' Leiter said. ''You have a mechanism in your mind that always tells you to go to your strength and be aggressive, but that also works against you, because you're not really pitching. You're giving into what hitters are looking for.''</p>
        <p>Third baseman Robin Ventura, whose two-run double gave the Mets a 3-2 lead with two out in the fifth, said he can see Leiter's confidence in the pitches he throws.</p>
        <p>Leiter relied so much on his cut fastball last year that hitters would look for it. Now, Ventura said, Leiter is throwing off-speed pitches and working the outside part of the plate often enough that hitters cannot afford to sit on the cutter.</p>
        <p>As a result, Ventura is not as busy as he was last year, when right-handed batters would ground Leiter's cutter toward him.</p>
        <p>''I've noticed a lot of balls going to center field or right field because he's using the other side of the plate,'' Ventura said. ''I don't really have to play as close to the line anymore with him.''</p>
        <p>Leiter squelched a two-out rally in the second by getting Neifi Perez to pop out with runners on first and second. But in the third, Jeff Cirillo and Jeffrey Hammonds put together consecutive hits with men in scoring position to take a 2-0 lead.</p>
        <p>The Mets got a run back in the third when Benny Agbayani, Rey Ordonez -- who had two hits -- and Joe McEwing all singled to right off the Rockies right-hander Rolando Arrojo.</p>
        <p>But the Mets left the bases loaded when Edgardo Alfonzo struck out and Mike Piazza popped to right, and they left men in scoring position in each of the final six innings.</p>
        <p>But Ventura's fifth-inning double was enough for Leiter, who turned things over to John Franco in the ninth. Armando Benitez was unavailable after throwing 32 pitches Tuesday, and Franco again filled in capably, working a 1-2-3 inning for his second save.</p>
        <p>''It felt good,'' said Franco, who is working both sides of the plate now instead of pounding hitters with inside fastballs, as he did when he struggled in April. ''I never said I couldn't do it no more. It felt good to be out there. I'm so used to being out there over the years, I haven't lost that feeling.''</p>
        <p>So Franco, for one night anyway, was back to being the closer. And Leiter performed like the ace of the rotation, even though that title belongs to Mike Hampton.</p>
        <p>''I've always believed that everybody should feel like an ace,'' Leiter said. ''If you don't, you're not worth your salt and shouldn't be a big-league starter.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>The right-hander BOBBY J. JONES will start tonight for the first time since he strained his right calf backing up third base on April 16. Jones, who made two rehab starts at Class AAA Norfolk, said he altered his mechanics slightly during the layoff after watching video of himself from prior years. ''He's getting through and finishing pitches,'' said the pitching coach, DAVE WALLACE. ''Rather than pushing it, he's just increasing his arm speed a little bit and adding some crispness to his pitches.'' Jones is 0-2 with a 16.20 earned run average in his three starts, and the Mets have gone 2-5 this year when the No. 4 starter pitches. ''That's not enough,'' Manager Bobby Valentine said. . . . JOHN FRANCO's appearance extended his own club record for the Mets to 501. That's 100 more outings for the team than the next pitcher on the Mets' career list, TOM SEAVER.</p>
        <p>PAUL WILSON, the former No. 1 overall pick who is recovering from elbow surgery at Norfolk, will be considered as both a reliever and a starter if he continues to show progress over the next month. ''If in some equation we were looking for a middle man, I think Paul could handle that role just as well as a starting role,'' said JIM DUQUETTE, the Mets' assistant general manager. Wilson, who has pitched in relief only once in his seven professional seasons -- worked five no-hit innings in his last start, on Monday, and finished with six scoreless innings and two hits allowed. He is 2-1 with a 7.36 E.R.A. in three Norfolk starts.</p>
