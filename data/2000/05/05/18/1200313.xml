        <p>THE phrase ''software pirate'' conjures up images of foreign sweatshops mass-copying software or hackers swapping files. But the Interactive Digital Software Association is trying to shut down a different type of pirate: people who just want to play out-of-print games.</p>
        <p>Publishers don't want to make old games available. The market wants games that push the limits of the processing and graphics capabilities of modern computers; a game designed for the Atari 800 or Apple II just won't sell at CompUSA.</p>
        <p>But at more than 100 sites on the Internet, you can download old out-of-print games, along with emulators to let you run them --  the games include the original versions of Atari 2600 games like Missile Command and Space Invaders as well as landmark computer games like M.U.L.E. and Balance of Power. These sites call the games abandonware: software for which publishers no longer offer technical support.</p>
        <p>Of course, the publishers don't view the games as abandoned. ''Copyrights and trademarks of games are corporate assets,'' Nintendo says on its Web site. ''If these vintage titles are available far and wide, it undermines the value of the intellectual property and adversely affects the right owners. Emulator and ROM piracy is competing head-on with Nintendo's current systems and software.''(ROM piracy is the copying of game code from the old read-only memory chips into files that can be stored on a computer.) So Nintendo and other companies want abandonware sites to shut down -- they leave enforcement to the software association.</p>
        <p>Their position is highly debatable. Gamers don't go out and download games for the original Nintendo Entertainment System instead of buying new games for Nintendo 64. Someone who wants to play an older game is looking for an experience that is different from what is available from a modern game. And by keeping older games alive, abandonware sites sometimes serve the ultimate interests of publishers: a new version of Frogger (first released in 1981) was one of the Top 10 best-selling computer games in 1999. Publishers became interested in re-releasing titles like Frogger precisely because they noticed that people were still playing it. Abandonware helped them identify a new market niche.</p>
        <p>Moreover, publishers provide no legal way for gamers to get older games; the market is too small to justify the effort. So gamers feel justified in making vintage games available, despite the legal risks.</p>
        <p>Older gamers' enthusiasm for games of their youth is only part of the story. In a speech at the Game Developers Conference in May in San Jose, Calif., Henry Jenkins, director of the comparative media studies program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, called electronic gaming one of the ''lively arts for the 21st century.'' He said that just as once-despised arts like jazz and film were now accepted as legitimate, so, too, would games be someday.</p>
        <p>If Dr. Jenkins is right, if gaming is ever to be understood as an art form that is worthy of study and has valuable things to offer, critics and academics and gamers must come to appreciate the history and development of the form. That appreciation can be created and sustained only if they have access to the games of the past.</p>
        <p>Access to vintage games is important for game designers, too. Just as novelists learn from novels and artists from art, game designers learn technique from the games they play.</p>
        <p>Their design repertory is expanded through exposure to games, but far too many game designers are ignorant of games published more than five years ago. That is especially a problem now because the hit-driven, me-too nature of the current market means that there is far less variety in the industry than there was even a few years ago. There is no way a company would pay to produce a game like Balance of Power, a serious simulation of international  political dynamics by Chris Crawford; M.U.L.E., a nonviolent economic game by Dani Bunten; or the original SimCity, by Will Wright (all best sellers in their day), because those games don't fit into accepted marketing categories.</p>
        <p>''Preserving old computer games isn't about sentimentality or retro trendiness or collectibility,'' said Richard Carlson, a game developer at Rogue Entertainment, in an e-mail message. ''It's about the history of art, storytelling, music, animation, programming, level design and all of the other disciplines involved in making classic game entertainment.''</p>
        <p>A book printed on acid-free paper will last for centuries. Film stock will last for decades, but even so, many early movies have been lost forever. Game preservation is in worse shape. Hardware and operating systems come and go. If you have a game designed for an Apple II, you will have a hard time figuring out how to run it.</p>
        <p>Software is about as ephemeral as you can get, yet preserving it is essential. Illegal abandonware sites are providing a critical service to game designers and scholars and gaming enthusiasts. They do not, however, provide a lasting and satisfactory solution to the problem because they are illegal.</p>
        <p>There may be another way. A group called the Electronic Conservancy has periodically mounted a museum exhibition called ''Videotopia,'' which last appeared in 1999 at the Maryland Science Museum.</p>
        <p>''Videotopia'' consists of 75 old and new arcade game machines, along with historical and background material. The Electronic Conservancy is devoted to preserving and maintaining these machines, and its advisory board consists of some of the most prominent figures in the development of the arcade game industry.</p>
        <p>Arcade gaming, however, is now about one-eighth the size of the combined console and computer gaming industries. It has stagnated for more than a decade.</p>
        <p>No one is doing anything similar to preserve console and computer games. And doing so through a museum exhibition or physical collection would be pointless; the way to offer these games to the largest possible audience is the way the abandonware movement does it: via the Web, providing emulators to allow people with new computers and consoles to play the original code. Ideally, you would do it one better, however: you would do it legally, with a Web site and with information to help people  install and play the games.</p>
        <p>Call it Gamemuseum.org. Create it as a nonprofit organization offering software that enables people to play out-of-print games -- with the permission of the owners.  Publishers could offer older products at no cost to themselves, and scholars, designers and fans of retro games could gain access.</p>
        <p>Even if a publisher developed a new version of an older game, the older version could serve, in a sense, as a demo for the new one. Players of the old version would be very likely to search out and buy the updated, superior version.</p>
        <p>Such a project would require financing, of course, but probably not much. The enthusiasm that leads to abandonware sites could be harnessed, providing volunteer labor to build and maintain the online museum.</p>
        <p>It would take an energetic person from the nonprofit sector to raise the money and build the organization, of course. But surely the effort would be worthwhile.</p>
        <p>Any takers?</p>
