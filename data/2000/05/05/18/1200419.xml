        <p>Editorial says reopened investigation has resulted in indictments of two former Ku Klux Klansmen, Bobby Frank Cherry and Thomas Blanton Jr, in 1963 bombing of 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, Ala, most heinous crime of civil rights era in numbers of people killed at single stroke; says prosecutions represent example of state-federal cooperation that was often missing in 1960's; says fact that legal resolution is still being pursued after so many years holds promise of new definition for Southern justice</p>

        <p>A new generation of Southern prosecutors has shown laudable persistence in reopening the investigations of Ku Klux Klansmen and other white racists suspected of civil rights killings in the 1960's. In the past decade, Mississippi authorities secured convictions in the murders of two of that state's black civil rights pioneers, Medgar Evers and Vernon Dahmer. Yesterday Doug Jones, the United States attorney in Birmingham, Ala., and David Barber, the local district attorney, revealed the murder indictments of two former Klansmen in one of the era's most heinous crimes, the Birmingham church bombing that killed four black girls on Sept. 15, 1963.</p>
        <p>Without prejudging the cases, it seems clear that authorities are armed with both determination and new information. As early as 1964, the indicted men, Bobby Frank Cherry and Thomas Blanton Jr., were identified in Federal Bureau of Investigation files as having helped a well-known Birmingham racist, the late Robert (Dynamite Bob) Chambliss, place the bomb at 16th Street Baptist Church in the predawn darkness of a Sunday morning. Chambliss was finally convicted of murder in 1977, but Alabama authorities felt their cases against Mr. Cherry, Mr. Blanton and a third Klansman, now deceased, were not as strong.</p>
        <p>According to The Jackson Clarion-Ledger, which has followed the new prosecutions in Alabama and Mississippi, Mr. Cherry's former wife and a granddaughter have now come forward to say they heard him admit participation in the bombing. Testimony at the Chambliss trial placed Mr. Blanton's car at the scene of the crime, but it is not clear what additional grand jury testimony may have led to his indictment. Both men have professed their innocence and attribute their prominence in F.B.I. files and other investigative records to conspiracies, betrayals or overzealous prosecutors.</p>
        <p>In fact, zeal in such investigations is warranted and was too long in coming. In the 1960's, Gov. George Wallace of Alabama and J. Edgar Hoover, both motivated by hostility to the civil rights movement, hampered efforts by state and federal investigators to prosecute the 16th Street bombing. In securing the conviction of Chambliss 14 years after the bombing, Alabama's attorney general at that time, Bill Baxley, set the precedent for the reopening of dormant civil rights crimes by Southern officials. In neighboring Mississippi, according to The Clarion-Ledger, state authorities have reopened nine cases, securing five murder convictions and one guilty plea. The latest round of prosecutions in Alabama represents an example of state-federal cooperation that was often missing in the 1960's. Mr. Jones, the United States attorney, has been designated a special assistant attorney general by the State of Alabama so he can present the cases against Mr. Cherry, now 69, and Mr. Blanton, 61.</p>
        <p>Such prosecutions give vitality to the legal principle that there is no statute of limitations on murder. As a matter of simple justice, that principle is valuable in every case. But it is especially important when killing is used as an instrument of political or racial oppression or is aimed at innocents like Denise McNair, Cynthia Wesley, Addie Mae Collins and Carole Robertson, the children who died in the rubble of 16th Street Baptist Church. In numbers of people killed at a single stroke, the 16th Street bombing was the most heinous crime of the civil rights era. It was a crime that helped bring white Alabama to what Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. called an accord with its conscience. Now, the fact that a legal resolution is still being pursued after so many years holds the promise of a new definition for Southern justice.</p>
