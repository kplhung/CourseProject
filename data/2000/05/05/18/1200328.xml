        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Sex, Lust, Drugs: Her Novel's Too Much for China'' (Shanghai Journal, May 11) not only shows the skittishness of Chinese censors, but also exposes the political games played between the authorities and those writers who strike an overtly oppositional stance largely for self-promotion.</p>
        <p>Zhou Weihui's glitzy but in reality rather ''safe'' representation of China's underground culture in her novel ''Shanghai Baby'' has been made to appear much more prurient and dangerous because of the authorities' decision. In this sense, these commercial writers and the censors have become strange bedfellows, forming a unique combination of authoritarianism and commercialism.</p>
        <p>The most devastating damage is the ever-shrinking space for discussion of serious matters like sexuality and women's issues, the truly alternative voice of which is being squeezed out.</p>
