        <p>In blunt and methodical fashion, federal prosecutors today began sketching out their tax fraud case against Albert J. Pirro Jr., Westchester's most prominent real estate development lawyer, calling him a wealthy and powerful man with ''unbridled greed'' who orchestrated ''amazing financial machinations'' to avoid paying taxes.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Pirro's wife, Jeanine F. Pirro, who is the Westchester County district attorney, looked on, the prosecutor, Cathy Seibel, accused Mr. Pirro, along with his brother and accountant, Anthony G. Pirro, of an ''immense pattern of deceit'' to deduct illegally more than $1 million in personal spending for Albert Pirro's family as business expenditures between 1988 and 1997. And it was a pattern, she contended, that was no accident because Albert Pirro was a ''shrewd, experienced businessman'' who should have known better.</p>

        <p>In blunt and methodical fashion, federal prosecutors today began sketching out their tax fraud case against Albert J. Pirro Jr., Westchester's most prominent real estate development lawyer, calling him a wealthy and powerful man with ''unbridled greed'' who orchestrated ''amazing financial machinations'' to avoid paying taxes.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Pirro's wife, Jeanine F. Pirro, who is the Westchester County district attorney, looked on, the prosecutor, Cathy Seibel, accused Mr. Pirro, along with his brother and accountant, Anthony G. Pirro, of an ''immense pattern of deceit'' to deduct illegally more than $1 million in personal spending for Albert Pirro's family as business expenditures between 1988 and 1997. And it was a pattern, she contended, that was no accident because Albert Pirro was a ''shrewd, experienced businessman'' who should have known better.</p>
        <p>''It is not a pretty picture, ladies and gentleman,'' Ms. Seibel, an assistant United States attorney, told jurors in a standing-room-only crowd filled with reporters at the Federal District Court here. ''It is a picture of greed and lust for material possessions spiraling out of control.''</p>
        <p>But in an equally forceful response, Albert Pirro's lead lawyer, Gustave H. Newman, said that far from engaging in a conspiracy, Albert, a hands-off, successful businessman with humble working-class roots, could not prevent his subordinates from preparing tax returns with ''misclassifications.'' And when he did find out about the misclassifications, Mr. Newman said, Mr. Pirro voluntarily turned over his records to the Internal Revenue Service and even repaid the government $150,000 more than what he actually owed in back taxes and interest.</p>
        <p>''Think he got a refund?'' Mr. Newman said. ''Think he even got a receipt? You know what he got? An indictment. I'll let you determine where the greed lies.''</p>
        <p>So began one of the biggest trials here in recent memory -- one that will scrutinize the private lives and spending habits of Westchester's most powerful couple, Albert Pirro and his wife, the district attorney.</p>
        <p>For a day at least, the trial delivered on its promise of crackling arguments and high-stakes poker. The biggest surprise, in fact, was Ms. Pirro's decision to accompany her husband to the courthouse, breaking her self-imposed silence on the case since defending him when the indictment was first filed in February 1999.</p>
        <p>''My family's in trouble now, and I feel it's important that I be here,'' Ms. Pirro said this morning. ''I'm confident that he'll be vindicated.''</p>
        <p>Later, after the conclusion of opening arguments, she told a cluster of reporters, ''I think it'll be clear that this is an overreaching effort by the government, and the charges against my husband are false.'' When asked whether she would be a regular fixture in the first row behind the defense tables, she said, ''I'm going to try to balance my role as district attorney in this county and support my family.''</p>
        <p>It was a split-screen image that became all too real this afternoon, when she abruptly left the courtroom to attend a court hearing in which a Yonkers official charged with sex crimes had agreed to plead guilty.</p>
        <p>Then, again, anything with the name Pirro seems to be tabloid fodder these days. Even before the trial of the Pirro brothers began, there were elements to fill a pulp-fiction novel, with the two brothers accusing each other of mental incompetence, Albert Pirro applying to join his own legal team, and prosecutors trying, unsuccessfully, to include a charge that would have implicated Robert E. Boyle, the Republican powerhouse who is the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.</p>
        <p>But once opening arguments commenced this morning before Judge Barrington D. Parker Jr., the lawyers began to outline, in dramatic and meticulous fashion, the guts of the case.</p>
        <p>According to Ms. Seibel, who was substituting for the lead prosecutor,  Elliott B. Jacobson, who was a bit under the weather, Albert Pirro used a variety of methods to hide personal expenses on items like a $45,000 electronic gate for his and his wife's house in Harrison, N.Y., expenses related to Ms. Pirro's election campaigns, golf lessons and an enclosed pen for their Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs.</p>
        <p>In several oblique criticisms of Ms. Pirro's role in the family finances, Ms. Seibel said a car Ms. Pirro had supposedly leased had actually been paid for by one of his companies. So after Ms. Pirro became a county judge and had judicial license plates affixed to the very same car, Ms. Seibel said, ''it couldn't be clearer that a car with judicial plates is not a business car.''</p>
        <p>Among other methods, Ms. Seibel asserted, Mr. Pirro, in concert with his brother, used corporate checks to pay for these personal goods and services, then deducted the expenses as business in nature, thereby hiding the income and lowering his tax bill. On average, she said, Mr. Pirro lowered his tax bill by 39 percent over a 10-year period.</p>
        <p>While Ms. Seibel was businesslike and methodical, rarely straying from the lectern when addressing the jury of eight men and four women, Mr. Newman, by contrast, cut a more folksy and animated figure, using photographs, documents and flow charts during his presentation of more than an hour.</p>
        <p>He talked at length about how Mr. Pirro had become a successful businessman and political lobbyist by dint of hard work, and made no apologies for Mr. Pirro's expensive tastes and big bills. After all, he said, you need to look good to entertain clients.</p>
        <p>He also talked about how Mr. Pirro was so inundated by varied business interests that what often happened was that his employees -- a secretary here, an accountant there -- would do the grunt work and just present Mr. Pirro with the papers to sign. So when Mr. Pirro found out about the accounting anomalies, he quickly hired a battery of lawyers and accountants to fix the problem, and pay the back taxes.</p>
        <p>''The evidence does lie,'' Mr. Newman said. ''People who engage in secrecy and conspiracy do not leave this kind of trail.'' Then, turning to Mr. Pirro, he said, ''Al, you're not as shrewd as they say you are.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Pirro smiled.</p>
        <p>Then it was time for Roger L. Stavis, Anthony Pirro's lawyer. In his brief remarks, he, too, suggested that the idea of fraud was a stretch because the brothers had nothing to hide, and had hid nothing. And he portrayed his overlooked and overshadowed client as someone who was only doing his job.</p>
        <p>In the afternoon, prosecutors called witnesses to detail the Pirro family's spending for personal, and not business, purposes. One witness was Scott Landis, a part-time employee in Mr. Pirro's law firm in White Plains, who said he had to modify his work schedule at the firm to perform numerous personal chores for the Pirros at their house in Harrison -- everything from taking care of the pets, to stocking the wine cellar, to maintaining the cars.</p>
