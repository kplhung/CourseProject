        <p>A young Cambodian immigrant who had just begun using his car as a taxi was fatally shot early yesterday morning in the Bronx, becoming the 10th cabby to be slain while on duty in the city this year.</p>
        <p>The police said the latest victim, Kim Hong Tim, 20, was driving his black Acura Legend for the Preferred Luxury Car Service shortly after midnight when the car crashed into a parked car at East 215th Street and Barnes Avenue.</p>
        <p>A woman who called 911 at first said that Mr. Tim, who was found lying on the pavement near the car, had been struck by the vehicle and was having trouble breathing. Emergency workers later found that he had been shot in the back and robbed, apparently before stumbling from the driver's seat. He was pronounced dead at 12:35 a.m. at Montefiore Medical Center.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tim, of the Bedford Park section of the Bronx, immigrated with his parents and five siblings to the United States in 1982 from the Cambodian city of Battambang, and grew up in the Bronx. He dropped out of high school two years ago to marry.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tim's family said yesterday that he had been laid off as a security guard within the last week and had converted the family car to a taxi to support his 2-year-old daughter, Aleena, and his wife, Gia Lee Tim, who is six months pregnant. His car did not have a bulletproof partition.</p>
        <p>His father, Sovann Tim, 56, said he did not know his son had begun working as a cabby until he learned of his death.</p>
        <p>''He never told me he was driving,'' he said. ''I feel like I want to die. I want to die with him.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tim's wife was inconsolable yesterday when news of his death reached her. ''She almost fainted,'' said Jenny Tim, 27, her sister-in-law.  ''She was crying uncontrollably until this morning.''</p>
        <p>The killing of Mr. Tim was the latest in a series of attacks against cabdrivers in the city. The deaths have prompted the city to underwrite the purchase of bulletproof partitions for all livery cabs, and the Police Department to deploy hundreds of extra officers each night on cabby-protection assignments.</p>
        <p>While the authorities said yesterday that Mr. Tim was not licensed as a cabdriver, and his Acura was not registered with the city's Taxi and  Limousine Commission, he clearly was working as a cabby.</p>
        <p>Nestor Rodriguez, a dispatcher at the Preferred Luxury Car Service at 1067 White Plains Road, said that Mr. Tim started a shift on Tuesday evening and spent the night ferrying passengers in the neighborhood. His last call, which came about 11:30 p.m., was to pick up a man on East 167th Street.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tim was not heard from again until 12:02 a.m., when the 911 caller reported the accident at East 215th Street.</p>
        <p>The police said the investigation was continuing, and declined to discuss a report that a gang member had been involved. Sgt. Brian Burke,  a police spokesman, said detectives were looking for the passenger Mr. Tim picked up at East 167th Street, and hoped to question him.</p>
        <p>The police said Mr. Tim had been robbed of cash, his jewelry and a two-way radio. Detectives also found a shell casing from a .380 semiautomatic pistol at the crime scene.</p>
        <p>Fernando A. Mateo, president of the New York State Federation of Taxi Drivers, said he spent part of the morning with Mr. Tim's family. He said that Mr. Tim was working in the taxi industry illegally and out of desperation, trying to support his family, and fell victim to the same sort of crime that had spread fear through the ranks of livery cabbies this year.</p>
        <p>''Certainly the person who did this meant to kill a livery cab driver,'' Mr. Mateo said. ''There is no doubt about it.''</p>
