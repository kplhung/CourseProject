        <p>Talk about mixed signals.</p>
        <p>George W. Bush's top economic adviser, Lawrence Lindsey, has been warning for some time that the stock market is dangerously overvalued, that it's a bubble that is bound to burst, and more likely sooner than later.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lindsey, who strongly favors Mr. Bush's proposed $1.3 trillion tax cut and argues that it would provide a needed economic stimulus, has warned his private clients of a potential stock market tailspin that could lead to a recession. He said he sold his own stocks about two years ago so he would be able ''to sleep at night.''</p>
        <p>That's one signal.</p>
        <p>The other signal came Monday when Mr. Bush told the nation that the key to saving Social Security retirement benefits was to allow working Americans to invest a portion of their Social Security taxes in the very same stock market that Mr. Lindsey, at the moment, wants no part of.</p>
        <p>Deciphering this can get confusing. It's as difficult in its way as picking winners in the market, or figuring the odds at the craps table in Atlantic City or Vegas. Do you feel lucky?</p>
        <p>''What Bush is doing is taking a guaranteed system that is indexed to inflation and shifting a portion of those benefits to a non-guaranteed, non-indexed system that's based on the luck of the stock market,'' said Roger Hickey, co-director of the Campaign for America's Future, a progressive policy organization in Washington.</p>
        <p>Even if Mr. Bush's bet is right -- that over the next several years the stock market will do better than most other investments -- there will still be many unfortunate wage earners finding themselves at retirement time on the wrong end of this big policy stick.</p>
        <p>The stock market, by definition, has winners and losers, even in the best of times. ''You could have pretty good returns in the market on average,'' said Mr. Hickey, ''but with a large number of individuals doing very poorly.</p>
        <p>''You could also have two people working side by side, making the same money in a job, and then one retires at a time the stock market is flush and the other retires a couple of years later when the stock market is crashing and people are losing their shirts.''</p>
        <p>There is, however, a group of guaranteed winners under Mr. Bush's plan -- the movers and shakers at the big brokerage houses who have been funneling many millions of dollars into the campaign coffers of Mr. Bush and other politicians, just begging them to steer some of the hundreds of billions of dollars in Social Security taxes their way.</p>
        <p>Everyone who sells stocks or mutual funds stands to benefit from this welfare scheme for the not-so-idle rich.</p>
        <p>Face it, the Republicans have had it in for Social Security since its inception. The historian William Manchester wrote about the G.O.P.'s desperate efforts in 1936 to block its creation: ''On radio spots, actors hired by the Republican National Committee revealed in shocked tones that each man would be given a number -- as though there were any other way to keep track of Social Security accounts -- and perpetrated the hoax that people would be fingerprinted.''</p>
        <p>When the Republicans won control of Congress in 1946, party leaders called for the repeal of Social Security. And nearly four decades later, Governor Bush's fellow Texan, Senator Phil Gramm, could be quoted as follows on the question of eliminating minimum benefits for the elderly:</p>
        <p>''They are 80-year-olds. Most people don't have the luxury of living to be 80 years old, so it's hard for me to feel sorry for them.''</p>
        <p>Governor Bush is trying to be a new kind of Republican, a new kind of conservative, a man who masks his party's traditionally harsh policies with a winning smile. Oh, he's a charmer.</p>
        <p>But look closely at what he is saying: ''First, we must not change Social Security for those now retired or nearing retirement. Let me put this plainly. For those on Social Security or close to receiving it, nothing will change. Government has made a commitment, and you have made your plans. These promises will be honored.''</p>
        <p>So those who are retired, or close to being retired, are safe. The rest of you, as far as I can tell, should look out.</p>
