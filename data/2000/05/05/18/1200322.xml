        <p>At first glance, the $40 Airplay video game controller looks much like any one of many handheld game devices. But a closer look reveals a significant advance: hey, no wires.</p>
        <p>Made by Eleven Engineering, based in Canada, Airplay uses radio waves, which are more reliable than the infrared signals used by television remote controllers.</p>
        <p>This year, the company hopes to ride an expected tidal wave of console-product sales with the introduction in October of Sony's much-anticipated PlayStation 2 in North America. Sony is preparing to ship two million PlayStation 2 consoles to North America this year.</p>
        <p>John Sobota, the chief executive of Eleven Engineering, said his company's controller, which has the familiar configuration of control keys, d-pad and thumb-controlled joysticks, is fully compatible with the new PlayStation.</p>
        <p>The device has a range of up to 25 feet, and in a demonstration last week at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles its game play could not be interrupted by objects or people moving between it and the game console.</p>
        <p>''Console gaming has evolved well beyond conventional controllers,'' Mr. Sobota said in a company statement.</p>
