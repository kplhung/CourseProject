        <p>After 24 years, Glen Sather's tenure in Edmonton is apparently nearing its end. Now, the question is whether Sather will wind up in New York as the Rangers' new president and general manager.</p>
        <p>Cal Nichols, the chairman of the Edmonton Investors Group Ltd., which owns the Oilers, said last night that the team's board of directors had scheduled a special meeting for this morning to discuss Sather's fate. Nichols would not say whether his coach was leaving.</p>
        <p>But one National Hockey League official said last night that there is a high probability that he's gone. If so, it is up to Sather to decide whether it is to the Rangers, or to Phoenix, where his old friend and former player, Wayne Gretzky, is mulling an offer of majority ownership in the Coyotes.</p>
        <p>The 56-year-old Sather, the Rangers' first choice for the job, has met twice with Madison Square Garden's president, Dave Checketts, in the last week and a half, once on the West Coast and once on the East Coast. According to The Edmonton Journal, Sather has been given oral permission to speak to the Rangers not by Nichols but by Jim Hole, the former chairman, who still retains the title of team governor.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, another N.H.L. official said that the league sees no violation in Sather's meetings with Checketts. Nichols does not feel that way.</p>
        <p>''The N.H.L. procedure is that anybody can talk to anybody else if they ask it by written request,'' Nichols said. ''The permission must be granted in writing. And that's not the situation that occurred.''</p>
        <p>Nichols would not say whether he would formally protest to the league.</p>
        <p>''We're sitting back, assessing where we're at,'' he said, ''and we're going to present to our board the alternatives we have, and how to remedy all of the above.''</p>
