        <p>Popes do not make a big deal of their birthdays. John Paul II usually celebrates his by holding a private lunch for close aides.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, however, he turns 80, a milestone that falls in a Holy Year of the Roman Catholic Church, and the Vatican has prepared a daylong religious and musical extravaganza.</p>
        <p>The archbishop of Paris, Cardinal Jean-Marie Lustiger, who is well aware of the pope's preference for low-key birthdays, dryly described the Vatican's fevered party-planning as a ''cardinals' plot.'' But among the chief conspirators is Gilbert Levine, a Jewish Brooklyn-born conductor who is so comfortable inside the Vatican that he refers to audiences with the pope as ''going upstairs.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Levine said he would ''go upstairs'' with his wife and two sons for a private,  relaxing audience with the pope on Friday. His younger son plays chess, and Mr. Levine said he would take along a chessboard in case the pope wants to test his skills against his 8-year-old's.</p>
        <p>But first, on Thursday evening inside the Vatican's vast Paul VI concert hall, Mr. Levine is planning to conduct the London Philharmonic Orchestra and Chorus and  guest soloists in Haydn's ''Creation'' to honor the pope. It will be Mr. Levine's third Vatican concert and the first at which he will wear a small red-and-gold button on his lapel, an insignia of the Equestrian Order of St. Gregory the Great, a papal knighthood bestowed on Mr. Levine in December 1994, a few months after he conducted a papal concert in the Vatican in memory of the Holocaust. The concert was a watershed event that Mr. Levine helped plan.</p>
        <p>''It was my suggestion that the pope attend a concert for the Holocaust organized by the Jewish community,'' Mr. Levine said in an interview, recalling another private meeting with the pope ''upstairs.'' He added: ''But the pope said, 'No, I want this to be a papal concert.' That's the way he is: if an idea is compelling, he makes it his own.''</p>
        <p>Few popes in history could have credibly claimed Jewish friends. But John Paul II, who grew up alongside Jews in Wadowice, Poland, before World War II, remains close to some survivors of the Holocaust, including a boyhood friend, Jerzy Kluger, who moved to Rome after the war and operates as a kind of backdoor emissary between the pope and Polish and American Jews. Mr. Levine is a more recent acquaintance, but his eagerness to put his music at the service of the pope has forged a  friendship between the two very different men.</p>
        <p>John Paul II has made Jewish-Christian rapprochement a hallmark of his papacy, an odyssey of reconciliation that began when he visited Auschwitz in 1979 and culminated in his whispered prayer at the Western Wall in Jerusalem during his Holy Land pilgrimage in March.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levine, whose grandparents were immigrants from Poland, became the conductor and musical director of the Cracow Philharmonic in December 1987 when Poland was still under Communist rule. He was a Jew taking on a prominent artistic position in a city whose Jewish residents had been all but wiped out by the Holocaust. That unusual role made him an ideal agent of the pope's larger goal of Jewish-Christian reconciliation.</p>
        <p>The Cracow conductor came to the  pope's attention through Cardinal Franciszek Macharski, who succeeded John Paul II as archbishop of Cracow, and sent a Newsweek article about Mr. Levine to the pope. ''If you are coming from Cracow,'' Cardinal Macharski joked in an interview, ''it is very easy to meet with the Holy  Father.''</p>
        <p>In February 1988 Mr. Levine was summoned to the Vatican. He recalled that the pope greeted him by saying, ''How are you treating my orchestra?'' and added, ''More importantly, how are they treating you?''  Later that year he was invited to bring the Cracow orchestra to the Vatican for a concert to celebrate the 10th anniversary of John Paul II's pontificate. On that visit he also brought his mother-in-law, an Auschwitz survivor, to meet the pope. ''He really made her understand powerfully, as a nonsurvivor, how much he understood,'' Mr. Levine said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levine, 52, who studied at Juilliard and Yale and worked with Nadia Boulanger in Paris and Sir Georg Solti in London, has never shed his down-to-earth Brooklyn manner. Blunt and exuberant, he does not seem like an obvious papal confidante. For one thing, his eagerness to talk about his relationship with the pope and repeat papal remarks raises some eyebrows in a milieu where self-promotion is more expertly veiled. As one Vatican official put it, ''People who really are his friends never say it.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Levine, well versed in Vatican protocol, has learned at least part of that lesson. ''I call him, 'your holiness,' he calls me 'maestro,' ''  Mr. Levine said. ''The relationship is warm and personable but I would never call myself a friend of the pope. He has showed me the most incredible warmth. I think that after our first meeting, he saw something about me that made it possible for him to think he might want to know me better.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Levine also became close to the pope's personal secretary, Msgr.  Stanislaw Dziwisz, the real gatekeeper at the Vatican. ''I would never bother him unless it is important;  he is a very busy man,'' Mr. Levine said. But later he recalled with relish a phone conversation with Monsignor Dziwisz he had had a few days earlier on his way from Cracow.</p>
        <p>''Our city has really changed,'' he recalled telling the pope's secretary  about Cracow, a city that he last saw in 1991 and that is the monsignor's hometown. Mr. Levine added that Monsignor Dziwisz ''was stunned how my Polish came back after only two days.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Levine, who learned Polish in  Cracow, said that he and the pope converse in Polish and that in one early meeting, when he and the pope and Cardinal Lustiger were discussing Mr. Levine's plans to hold a memorial concert for reconciliation at an empty Cracow synagogue, the pope translated their conversation into French for the cardinal. (Mr. Levine said he and the cardinal usually speak in German, using the familiar ''du.'')</p>
        <p>Cardinal Lustiger, archbishop of Paris, has known Mr. Levine for years and was the one to invest him as a papal knight in 1994, making him the fourth Jew so honored. (A fifth was named in 1998.) The Cardinal shares Mr. Levine's Polish-Jewish roots; the cardinal was born in Paris, his mother, who had been born in Poland, died at Auschwitz, and he was sheltered by Catholics during the war and eventually converted. The cardinal did not hesitate to describe Mr. Levine as a ''friend'' of the pope, saying that John Paul II  was fond of the American conductor.</p>
        <p>But he placed the friendship in the context of the pope's larger vision.  ''Gilbert's enthusiasm was helpful to the pope,'' he said. ''Music is a language that can help advance human understanding and ease conflicts. The concert for the Shoah was quite astonishing, though in the year 2000 and the pilgrimage to the Holy Land the pope has in a way surpassed that which music promised.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Levine said he had sold the pope on the idea of another Vatican concert by presenting it as a papal concert to commemorate the millennium; a series of concerts to promote interfaith understanding in 2000 that Mr. Levine plans to take on tour to the United States, France, Spain and Israel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levine said that John Paul II  chose the date for the Vatican concert. ''It was really his idea,'' Mr. Levine said. ''When I described the idea for the concert, the pope told me, 'It should be on my birthday.' ''</p>
