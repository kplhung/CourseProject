        <p>Tantalizingly close to an outright majority, Hipolito Mejia of the left-leaning Dominican Revolutionary Party today declared himself the winner of Tuesday's presidential election, vowing that the country's poorest residents would no longer be bystanders to the economic boom of the last four years.</p>
        <p>His exuberant declaration -- which came more than 12 hours before the electoral council said tonight that he had 49.85 percent of the vote with 99 percent of the ballots counted  -- sent thousands of supporters to the streets waving the party's white banner as they danced to a symphony of honking horns.</p>

        <p>Tantalizingly close to an outright majority, Hipolito Mejia of the left-leaning Dominican Revolutionary Party today declared himself the winner of Tuesday's presidential election, vowing that the country's poorest residents would no longer be bystanders to the economic boom of the last four years.</p>
        <p>His exuberant declaration -- which came more than 12 hours before the electoral council said tonight that he had 49.85 percent of the vote with 99 percent of the ballots counted  -- sent thousands of supporters to the streets waving the party's white banner as they danced to a symphony of honking horns.</p>
        <p>In a gleeful jab at their rout of the governing Dominican Liberation Party, whose policies of privatization and modernization have been slow to benefit many of the country's poor, Mr. Mejia's supporters triumphantly brandished brooms, cutting the air like saber-waving conquerors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mejia, an agronomist and  businessman who was a cabinet official in the late 1970's, insisted that the government had to increase spending on health, education and housing, as well as find ways to help beleaguered farmers. He said the time had come to ensure that the country's phenomenal economic growth of approximately 8 percent in recent years provided tangible benefits to the majority of citizens.</p>
        <p>He also invoked the memory of the late Jose Francisco Pena Gomez, who was his party's beloved leader for many years. ''What we will do will be for the benefit of the hungry masses of the country,'' he said at an early morning meeting with his party's leadership. ''What Pena wanted, we will fulfill.''</p>
        <p>The premature celebrations were criticized by supporters of the Dominican Liberation Party, who had wanted their candidate, Danilo Medina, to face Mr. Mejia in a runoff. While Mr. Mejia's supporters had taken to the streets, the final tally was delayed as exhausted members of the electoral council took a five-hour break to get some sleep. The Dominican Liberation Party, or  P.L.D., and the Social Christian Reformist Party of the country's longtime former president, Joaquin Balaguer, garnered 24.9 and 24.6 percent of the vote respectively.</p>
        <p>The celebratory mood, however, turned violent tonight when shots were fired near the headquarters of the Dominican Liberation Party. Witnesses said the shots came from a car that was flying the banner of the Dominican Revolutionary Party. Security men from the Liberation Party returned the fire. No one was injured and the car sped off after glancing off a parked car.</p>
        <p>''Mejia made a mistake by proclaiming himself the winner so early,'' said Julio Cesar Quello, a vice secretary for the P.L.D. ''Now their people have been drinking all day and they are beyond his control.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mejia's supporters said their candidate's wide margin should be acknowledged by their opponents as a de facto victory and that they should spare the country the time and expense of a June 30 runoff by conceding defeat. Late tonight, Dominican Liberation Party supporters were still waiting for the final tally before making any announcement about their intentions.</p>
        <p>Several times throughout the day, Mr. Mejia insisted that he would reach out to his opponents' supporters and include them in his government. But in a televised interview, he  also said his background put him in a good position to reassess the effects of the current government's economic priorities.</p>
        <p>''We want to confront the corruption and lack of planning,'' he said. ''My strength is in finance and management and the reordering of public affairs. I expect to be an institutional president who will not go outside of the legal framework. I will properly manage the finances of the country.''</p>
        <p>Although some officials of the opposing parties said electoral officials  had directed some voters to incorrect polling places, affecting the vote, teams of international observers said they had not detected any irregularities.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, one observer said it was ''unconscionable'' that the tally had been delayed so long.</p>
        <p>While the Dominican economy was the fastest growing in Latin America last year, the policies of the current president, Leonel Fernandez, alienated many voters. Supporters of Mr. Medina acknowledged that the benefits of Mr. Fernandez's policies had trickled down slowly. ''The government process of privatization was necessary,'' said Felix Rodriguez, an elementary school teacher and P.L.D. supporter. ''But it affected hundreds of families who were not able to find a place in the economy.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Medina was also hurt by his perceived colorlessness, failing to inspire enthusiasm among some members of his own party.</p>
        <p>''Here is an economy that under Leonel Fernandez grew to be an example for Latin America, so why did the government's candidate not rise higher?'' said Bernardo Vega, a former Dominican ambassador to the United States. ''When Danilo spoke, he did not excite the people.'' What mattered most to Mr. Mejia's supporters was the sorry state of their personal economy.</p>
        <p>''The rich say there is economic growth,'' said Felix Bonilla, a chauffeur. ''But the only thing growing are their pockets.''</p>
        <p>Among the most jubilant of Mr. Mejia's many supporters were women and homemakers, who had turned out in large numbers on election day to put an end to what they said were years of high food prices and unemployment.</p>
        <p>Juana Espinosa, a nurse who said she could not find a hospital job, sat outside her beverage stand a few feet away from Mr. Mejia's party headquarters.</p>
        <p>''The people wanted a real government to bring them work, not just pretty words,'' she said. ''The women have seen how there has been inflation in the kitchen and in caring for their children. We deal with that and we saw we were on the precipice. If you do not have enough to feed your children, there is nothing you can change. But you can change the government.''</p>
