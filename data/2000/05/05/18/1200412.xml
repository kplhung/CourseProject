        <p>Bombarded with pitches for new and different ways to invest their savings, most people might conclude that the last thing the world needs is another twist on owning stocks. Steven Wallman is not one of those people.</p>
        <p>This week, while the leaders of the mutual fund industry munch shrimp and sip chardonnay at their annual gathering in Washington, Mr. Wallman will be 15 miles away in Vienna, Va., plotting to take the finger food out of their mouths. Mr. Wallman, a headstrong former securities regulator with an appetite for reform, is increasingly irritated by what he sees as the burdens the typical mutual fund puts on shareholders.</p>
        <p>Most funds are not worth owning, Mr. Wallman says, because they cost too much, repeatedly fail to beat the market and frequently stick shareholders with big tax bills. Funds set up to track market indexes solve some problems, but they do not offer investors much choice or control of risk, he says.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallman says he has found a better and, in many cases, cheaper way for investors to create their own, customized baskets of stocks, which he calls folios, and two months ago he started selling them over the Internet.</p>
        <p>He is not alone in trying to harness Internet technology to give investors an alternative to mutual funds and brokerage accounts. In San Francisco, a start-up called eInvesting plans to introduce ''build your own'' funds by September. ''There is an enormous opportunity, leveraging the Web, to combine the convenience and instant diversification of a mutual fund with the control and direct stock ownership of a brokerage account,'' said Ben Phillipps, vice president for marketing at eInvesting.</p>
        <p>The various fees that funds charge add up to, on average, 1.35 percent of assets. On the median mutual fund investment, about $38,000, that translates to annual fees of $513, Mr. Wallman said.</p>
        <p>''If people realized it's costing them $500 a year, that's something they would be really shocked about,'' he said. ''Why don't funds have to disclose the monthly cost?''</p>
        <p>It is bad news for the fund industry that that question is being raised by Mr. Wallman, a man so persistent that he is still pushing for stocks to be traded in decimals instead of fractions two and a half years after he left his appointed position on the Securities and Exchange Commission. Mr. Wallman, 46, is an iconoclast who often butted heads with Arthur Levitt, the commission chairman, and members of the commission staff. He does not abandon a cause lightly, but he contends that his latest venture is no quixotic mission.</p>
        <p>For a fee of $295 a year, Mr. Wallman's company, Folio[fn], will let investors create three do-it-yourself stock funds containing as many as 50 stocks each and as much money as they choose. For no additional charge, they can make changes in their holdings as often as twice a day through what Mr. Wallman hopes will become an efficient internal trading system.</p>
        <p>Whether the world will beat a path to Mr. Wallman's home page at www.foliofn.com is far from certain. He is not the first to try to tap into investors' growing discomfort with traditional funds, a restlessness that has spawned several variations.</p>
        <p>Some fund companies have begun listing fund shares on the major exchanges, where they can be priced and traded all day. The Vanguard Group, the leading purveyor of the index funds so popular with buy-and-hold investors, announced plans last week to list shares of several of its most popular funds, including the flagship Vanguard 500 Index fund.</p>
        <p>Other companies have created funds that let small investors take high-risk chances on companies that have not yet been cleared to sell shares to the public. Merrill Lynch and other brokerage firms have created baskets of stocks in a given industry that can be bought at relatively low cost.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of new ideas out there, and some, like exchange-traded funds, are starting to catch on,'' said John Rekenthaler, research director for the fund tracking firm Morningstar Inc. in Chicago. The folio concept ''is a pretty big idea that's going to stick in some form,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Still, it will be a while before this new breed of investment product takes a measurable bite out of mutual funds, which have been the individual's investment of choice for more than a decade. The Investment Company Institute, which is holding its annual trade show this week in Washington, estimates that Americans have more than $4.4 trillion invested in 4,432 all-stock funds, a tenfold increase since 1990.</p>
        <p>Burton Greenwald, a mutual fund consultant in Philadelphia, is dubious about the staying power of individuals' interest in managing dozens of stocks. ''Will these products be a threat to funds?'' he said. ''I don't think so. I suspect their popularity would fade quickly if you had a prolonged bear market.''</p>
        <p>Folio[fn], whose quirky name, Mr. Wallman said, stands for financial innovation, is taking aim at the bulk of that money, which sits in funds whose managers are paid to try for a higher return than, say, the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index. Mr. Wallman and his colleagues say that type of investing is pure folly.</p>
        <p>''Every study has shown that stock picking by mutual funds has not been overly successful,'' Mr. Wallman said last Friday over a plate of vegetarian pad Thai with steamed tofu at a restaurant next door to his office. ''Unless you think you can pick the manager who will outperform, why pay money to throw the dice?''</p>
        <p>The standard disclaimer in fund marketing materials that past performance is no guarantee of future returns should be replaced, Mr. Wallman said, with a warning label that reads: ''Past performance has absolutely nothing to do with future performance.''</p>
        <p>Point out that he sounds a lot like John C. Bogle, the founder of Vanguard, who has long been an outspoken proponent of low-cost index funds, and Mr. Wallman grins. Mr. Bogle is ''one of my heroes,'' he said. ''I would love to get Bogle working with us.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallman acknowledges that his folios are not for everybody. ''If you've only got $10,000 or $20,000, then you ought to be in Vanguard 500,'' he said. ''It's a very good buy.''</p>
        <p>But investors with $30,000 or more in folios would pay less than 1 percent of their assets annually and gain the flexibility to choose the stocks they own and to adjust their holdings frequently to match their tolerance for risk. To help them get started, Folio[fn] offers sample folios, like one that contains the 30 stocks in the Dow Jones industrial average.</p>
        <p>With a few clicks of a mouse, an investor can order, say, $6,000 worth of the Dow 30, and get $200 worth of each stock -- fractional shares in many cases -- in one swoop. A week or two later, that investor could sell 10 stocks and replace them with 10 others, then ask Folio[fn] to rebalance the folio to keep the investment spread evenly.</p>
        <p>Using a discount brokerage firm, those moves would count as 50 to 100 trades or more. Even at commissions as low as $8 a trade, that would cost $400 to $900.</p>
        <p>Folio[fn]'s pricing structure puzzles some people who have taken a look at its Web site. ''How are they going to make any money doing that?'' wondered one broker at Merrill Lynch, which last year started allowing customers to make unlimited trades for a minimum annual fee of $1,500.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallman and his financial backers say that Folio[fn] can be profitable because it is building a computerized trading system that will keep most trades in-house, matching customer purchases and sales of popular stocks without incurring the costs of a middleman.</p>
        <p>Allen Morgan, general partner of Mayfield Fund, a venture capital firm in Menlo Park, Calif., that has invested about $20 million in the company, says the proprietary trade-matching and  -processing system is the key. Once Folio[fn] builds a base of thousands of customers, he said, its technology-based system could become very profitable.</p>
        <p>Until it gets to that point, Folio[fn] is compiling the orders customers place and sending them to market-making firms in two daily batches, at 10:15 a.m. and at 2:45 p.m. On those trades it can match among its customers, Folio[fn] says it will split the difference, or spread, between the prevailing prices offered to buy and sell that stock. On trades it sends to other firms, Folio[fn] will receive payments from them of up to $2 a trade, a form of kickback that is common in the brokerage industry.</p>
        <p>''You either leave that money with the market maker or you take it,'' Mr. Wallman said. ''That's an easy decision.''</p>
        <p>One paradox of Mr. Wallman's involvement is that his firm stands to gain in a couple of ways from Wall Street's foot-dragging on the switch to trading stocks in increments of pennies, instead of fractions of a dollar. More than three years after agreeing to make the change, the managers of the Nasdaq market have asked to put it off until next year.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallman estimates the delay is costing investors hundreds of millions of dollars a year, and despite his financial interest, he is still calling for the S.E.C., where he was a commissioner from 1994 to 1997, to insist that the New York Stock Exchange switch to decimals without waiting for the Nasdaq. Meantime, the higher costs of trading elsewhere could serve as a marketing tool for Folio[fn] as it takes in payments for sending orders to other firms.</p>
        <p>Nell Minow, a prominent shareholder advocate, says she is a convert to folios. Ms. Minow has known Mr. Wallman since he was a partner in the Washington law firm of Covington &amp; Burling lobbying for state laws to stifle corporate raiders.</p>
        <p>As a friend she tested Folio[fn]'s service and came away impressed. ''I have never in my life invested in a share of stock on my own,'' said Ms. Minow, who was a driving force behind Lens Investment Management, an activist money management firm. ''I personally can't stand working with money managers at the retail level because I feel their interests are contrary to mine. I feel I've had a lot of bad advice over the years.''</p>
        <p>She said she would move some of her family's savings from mutual funds to folios to take advantage of the greater flexibility. She also likes the simple way that Folio[fn] has set up to allow investors to vote their shares for company directors and proxy proposals electronically. Ms. Minow, who considers herself a crusader and Mr. Wallman more of an idealist, said she hoped folio investors would use the Web site as a forum for sharing views on issues of corporate governance.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wallman's idea of using the Internet to help individual investors communicate and marshal their collective power is a bold stroke, Ms. Minow said. ''Talking to him,'' she said, ''is like driving on the autobahn: You can go as fast as you want and he'll always keep up with you and respond to what you're saying. It's delicious to bat around ideas with him.''</p>
        <p>Barry Barbash, a former chief regulator of mutual funds at the S.E.C., had a different taste after tangling with Mr. Wallman over some mandatory disclosures that Mr. Wallman thought would benefit small investors. ''When you were done with Steve, you oftentimes felt you had just completed a prizefight that went the maximum number of rounds,'' said Mr. Barbash, now a partner with the law firm of Shearman &amp; Sterling in Washington.</p>
        <p>''This product he's developed is absolutely consistent with the views he articulated when he was on the commission about the lack of transparency and high fees,'' Mr. Barbash said. ''It is intended to be something that's anti-establishment. Whatever you think of it, it's absolutely Steve Wallman.''</p>
