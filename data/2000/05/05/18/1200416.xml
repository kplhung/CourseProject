        <p>Poor organization, inadequate financing and a lack of aggressive leadership have eroded the ability of United States intelligence agencies to face new threats, said a Congressional report released today.</p>
        <p>It also found that the effects made the agencies more prone to serious errors like the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade.</p>
        <p>In a scathing survey of the Central Intelligence Agency, the National Security Agency and the other elements of the intelligence apparatus, the report, by the House Intelligence Committee, found that ''the United States is placing undue risks on its armed forces and its national security interests by not redressing the many crucial problems facing the intelligence community.''</p>
        <p>The report was issued in connection with the committee's proposed intelligence budget for fiscal 2001. It argued that broad, systemic problems were behind a series of costly mistakes, from the C.I.A.'s failure to predict that India would test nuclear weapons to the embassy bombing.</p>
        <p>Resources are being drawn off to meet day-to-day tactical requirements, meaning that broader, strategic intelligence has suffered, the report found.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for the C.I.A. would not comment on the House report.</p>
        <p>The report charged that ''human intelligence'' -- espionage by spies operating overseas -- was now stretched too thin by demands from policy makers to provide support for military operations and other emergencies in developing countries.</p>
        <p>Technical intelligence programs, from spy satellites to eavesdropping and code-breaking operations, also came in for tough criticism. The report said that imagery intelligence still suffered from ''totally inadequate systems planning and investment'' and that ''unanticipated technical problems'' with some new satellite programs would ''likely cause scheduling delays and cost increases.''</p>
        <p>The National Security Agency, the super-secret eavesdropping and code-breaking office, was called unable to keep up with advances in communications technology. The agency, the report concluded, ''is seemingly incapable of responding in an integrated fashion'' to the challenges posed by the spread of new global networks that tie together radio, satellite microwave, cellular and cable traffic.</p>
        <p>It is becoming increasingly difficult for National Security Agency to penetrate and then sift through the flood of e-mail, cell phone calls and other new forms of communications to find the few bits of secret information from other countries that the government might need.</p>
        <p>The House panel also expressed anger at the handling of a series of security breaches at the State Department. Among other matters, the report noted that the State Department had delayed notifying the F.B.I. of the recent disappearance of a laptop computer containing classified material for up to two months, hindering the bureau's ability to conduct an effective investigation.</p>
        <p>The House panel has concerns about the scope and enforcement of a new State Department policy restricting unescorted visitors to the department's headquarters, the report added. In fact, the F.B.I. has reported that foreign spies have frequently taken advantage of the State Department's lax policy on visitors, and that some spies obtained access to the department by posing as reporters.</p>
