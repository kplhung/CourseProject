        <p>HAROLD O. LEVY, the new schools chancellor, is a white man. He is a Jewish white man. And neither his race nor his religion got in the way of the Board of Education's unanimous vote last night naming him head of the largest school system in the country.</p>
        <p>This could not have happened just a few years ago in New York City. The last white chancellor, Frank J. Macchiarola, stepped down in 1983 and each of the full-time chancellors since have been black or Hispanic (except for Bernard Mecklowitz, who served briefly after Chancellor Richard R. Green's death in 1989). The very idea that a white person could lead the largely black and Hispanic school system has been unthinkable for at least a political generation.</p>
        <p>And for now, it isn't.</p>
        <p>Sandra Feldman, the president of the American Federation of Teachers and the former head of the city's teachers union, was silent for a moment when asked about the meaning of Mr. Levy's race. ''You know, I hadn't even thought about that,'' said Ms. Feldman, who well remembers the teachers strike of 1968 and the strains it engendered between blacks and Jews.</p>
        <p>What's going on?</p>
        <p>Some of Mr. Levy's emergence is clearly his doing. He's shown good political skills, winning over all Board of Education members after becoming interim chancellor by a 4-to-3 vote, and neutralizing Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who dropped his earlier objections to him.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy impressed educators and parents during his four months as interim chancellor, and has a solid record of working with blacks and Hispanics as a member of the Board of Regents and with the Rev. Jesse Jackson on the Wall Street project -- an effort to expand minority hiring and investment in minority-owned companies. It no doubt helped, too, that the Board of Education's president, William C. Thompson Jr., is black.</p>
        <p>But merit would have been irrelevant a few years back. It is increasingly apparent that the selection of a Chancellor Levy is possible today mainly because of changes in the racial and political climate in the city.</p>
        <p>''I think people realize that just because a person may be black or Latino doesn't make him -- or hopefully, in the future, her -- the best person to do the job,'' suggested Dennis Walcott, president of the New York Urban League. ''I think people are more interested not in racial dynamics but concrete issues of having teachers able to teach, of having children able to read.</p>
        <p>''I'm not being Pollyanna and saying black, Jewish and racial issues have disappeared off the screen. Ridiculous. But it's not as it was.''</p>
        <p>THAT it isn't. The strike by the teachers union in 1968, which led to decentralization of the city school system, was freighted with black-white, black-Jewish antagonisms and expressions of anti-Semitism. Tensions simmered, and by the time Mr. Macchiarola left in 1983, the demand for a black chancellor had grown loud and angry. Protesters conducted furious demonstrations at board headquarters.</p>
        <p>A Latino educator, Anthony J. Alvarado, finally got the job of running the schools that year. After that, it was a given that the school system -- now 37 percent Hispanic, 36 percent African-American, 10 percent Asian and only 6 percent white -- should be led by a member of a minority group.</p>
        <p>But that changed. When a black Board of Education member, Irving S. Hamer Jr., made a last-minute bid for the chancellor's job, the black political community was all but silent. Last night, Dr. Hamer voted for Mr. Levy, and Mr. Levy's race was noted  by only one speaker.</p>
        <p>''This says that many of us in the African-American community are far more concerned with policy than color,'' said the Rev. Al Sharpton, who was arrested at one of those demonstrations 17 years ago. Last weekend, he welcomed Mr. Levy to his National Action Network in Harlem. ''We want to get blacks empowered, but we want to get the right blacks empowered,'' Mr. Sharpton explained, critical of the last black chancellor, Rudy Crew, for getting too close to the mayor. That ''neutralized a lot of us who were saying it was just a question of color,'' Mr. Sharpton said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson, the board president, suggests that the city's recent history explains Mr. Levy's emergence. Blacks and Hispanics can no longer say that they have been left out of the process. Nor can they say that having power inevitably made a big difference to children. ''We've had Latino superintendents, African-American superintendents, and that didn't change things overnight,'' said Mr. Thompson. ''It wasn't a magic bullet. The bottom line now is, we just want the best person.''</p>
        <p>METRO MATTERS  Correction:  May 24, 2000, Wednesday  The Metro Matters column on Thursday, about the election of Harold O. Levy as New York schools chancellor -- the first non-Hispanic white person to hold the post permanently since 1983 -- misstated the percentage of white students in the city's public school system. It is 16 percent, not 6.</p>
