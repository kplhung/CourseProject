        <p>Stocks fell for the first time in five sessions yesterday as investors took some profits from the recent run-up in prices and re-examined the potential effect of the Federal Reserve's half-point increase in interest rates on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>The sell-off was widespread, with each of the three main market gauges falling more than 1 percent.</p>
        <p>But traders and analysts said the drop was understandable in light of the market's recent gains and a clear signal from the Fed that the rate increase -- the sixth since last June -- would probably not be the last. The central bank signaled its resolve in a tough statement that accompanied its move to raise the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks by 50 basis points, to 6.5 percent.</p>
        <p>''If you read that statement in a couple of years, you would have no clue that the Fed had already done five tightenings,'' said Thomas M. McManus, chief equity strategist at the Bank of America. ''So far, there is little evidence that the tightening they have done to date has slowed the economy appreciably.''</p>
        <p>Market gauges opened lower and stayed that way for the entire session. An announcement by Intel that it again intends to split its stock and to raise its dividend at the end of July helped lift the indexes off their lows during the afternoon, but the relief was temporary.</p>
        <p>The Dow Jones industrial average fell 164.83 points, or 1.51 percent, to 10,769.74. Hewlett-Packard, which dropped more than 9 points; General Motors; and Minnesota Mining and Manufacturing led the blue-chip index down. Only 4 of the 30 stocks in the Dow managed to move higher for the day. Market breadth was distinctly negative, with declining stocks outnumbering those advancing, 1,906 to 1,017.</p>
        <p>Cisco Systems, which fell 2 9/16, to 58, led the Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index lower. It dropped 18.24 points, or 1.24 percent, to 1,447.80.</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index shed 72.61 points, or 1.95 percent, to 3,644.96, pulled down by stocks like Cisco, Microsoft, Qualcomm and Nextel. Over the previous four sessions, the Nasdaq had gained 9.8 percent. So far this year, it is down 10.43 percent.</p>
        <p>Lycos, a big winner on Tuesday, was a big loser yesterday, perhaps reflecting reluctance by some United States investors to own foreign-controlled companies. Its stock fell 15 1/64 to 57 39/64 in very heavy trading, after having risen 18 percent on Tuesday, when the portal agreed to be bought in a stock swap by Terra Networks, the Internet unit of the Spanish phone giant Telefonica. Terra's American depository receipts fell 6 9/16, to 47.</p>
        <p>Small stocks also took a beating. The Russell 2000 index dropped 6.32 points, or 1.25 percent, to 499.66.</p>
        <p>With the Fed remaining on the offensive, ''we will see a trendless market for a while,'' said Kenneth M. Sheinberg, head of listed stock trading at SG Cowen.</p>
        <p>''People will continue to take some money out of stocks with high price-to-earnings multiples and put money into stocks with reasonable prices,'' he said. ''That will create some stability in the market, which is what Alan Greenspan really wants.''</p>
        <p>While broad sections of the market moved lower, financial services stocks, widely seen as vulnerable to rising interest rates, were little changed.</p>
        <p>J. P. Morgan, a Dow component, rose 11/16, to 132 5/8. Citigroup fell  5/8, to 61 1/16. Merrill Lynch was unchanged at 108. And Morgan Stanley Dean Witter closed at 76, up 13/16.</p>
        <p>Hewlett-Packard was the Dow's big loser, dropping 9 5/16, to 130 11/16. The stock had surged nearly 10 percent over the previous four trading days.</p>
        <p>AT&amp;T eased 13/16, to 38 1/16, after Jack Grubman, an analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, lowered his earnings forecast for 2001.</p>
        <p>Cisco fell 2 9/16, to 58, its first decline in three sessions. Microsoft dipped 1 13/16, to 67 11/16, after a four-day rally. And Oracle fell 1, to 78 3/16.</p>
        <p>Intel was one of a very few big technology stocks to rise. It closed at 123 3/16, up 15/16. The company announced a 2-for-1 stock split, and said it would raise its modest quarterly dividend by 33 percent, effective July 31.</p>
        <p>Mr. McManus, the Bank of America strategist, said he remained positive about the stock market, but expected the Fed to increase interest rates again at its next meeting, on June 27-28.</p>
        <p>''We told people this morning that it was pretty likely the Fed would bump rates another 50 basis points in June,'' he said. ''But I am still encouraged that the market is broadening, and that the S.&amp; P. is going up. I expect the market to remain in a trading range, for technology stocks to continue to correct, and for some of the other sectors that have underperformed sharply over the last year to continue to work their way higher.''</p>
