        <p>WITH its shrinking population, declining industrial base and notoriously cold, snowy winters, Buffalo has had its share of image problems for years. But local officials and civic boosters insist that the city and its environs do not deserve their unfortunate reputation. And today, they are announcing a major promotional campaign aimed at proving that the climate upstate is just fine, for people and for businesses, too.</p>
        <p>The campaign is sponsored by the Buffalo Niagara Enterprise, a not-for-profit economic development marketing consortium founded last year to encourage businesses to invest in an area comprising the eight westernmost counties of New York as well as the Niagara peninsula of southern Ontario. Nearly 70 participants, including local municipalities and private businesses like Key Bank, HSBC Bank, the Buffalo Bills and Moog Inc., an upstate manufacturer of motion-control components, have joined, as has one Canadian participant, the Ontario-based Canadian Niagara Power Company Ltd.</p>
        <p>As a result of their contributions, the money needed for the first year -- about $5 million -- is already in hand, according to Tom Kucharski, the president and chief executive of Buffalo Niagara. That is part of a total of $27 million committed by Buffalo Niagara's members, three-quarters of it from private companies, according to Ted M. Levine, chairman of Development Counsellors International, the public relations firm representing Buffalo Niagara.</p>
        <p>That is a large amount to spend on marketing by a community development organization seeking to create jobs. ''I cannot think of another community -- especially a moderately sized one -- that has even come close to raising that kind of sum,'' said Mark Waterhouse, an economic development consultant who was formerly chairman of the American Economic Development Council, an organization for economic development professionals. With a goal of 50,000 new jobs and $1 billion in new investment over the next five years, it is also one of the most ambitious  development plans put forward in recent years, he said.</p>
        <p>''The challenge is to put forward in a focused way all that we have to offer,'' said Mr. Kucharski, who came to Buffalo Niagara from the Lehigh Valley Economic Development Corporation in eastern Pennsylvania, where his efforts as president helped attract 18,000 jobs over four years. But the job is bigger in Buffalo-Niagara, he said, not only because of the greater size of the region -- 2.2 million residents as opposed to Lehigh Valley's 600,000 -- but also because of the highly negative feelings about the area held by strangers and natives alike.</p>
        <p>Indeed, not only do people in general have a ''terrible image of the Buffalo-Niagara region,'' so do people living in and around the city, many of whom have ''incredibly low self-esteem,'' said Doug Bean, a managing partner at Eric Mower &amp; Associates, the six-office agency based in Syracuse whose Buffalo team is handling the Buffalo-Niagara account. In addition to aiming at businesses outside the region, he has made ''internal'' marketing a priority.</p>
        <p>''If people who live here are down on the area, especially service and hospitality workers, that can have a big impact on visitors who interact with them,'' he said. ''So we're going to use this campaign to re-educate our own constituency as well as anything else we do.''</p>
        <p>Regardless of the recipient, the message Buffalo Niagara will be delivering will be the same, a simple one that tracks the campaign's three-word slogan: ''available. productive. people.''</p>
        <p>Print ads and broadcast spots will feature residents of the area extolling local advantages, like the high concentration of college students, affordable housing, low office rents, and the fact that the work force in the area is ranked ninth in the country in production output per wage dollar spent. Not to mention, ''summers that are just beautiful'' and winters that are ''not nearly as snowy as people think,'' according to Mr. Kucharski (''More sun than Atlanta, less rain than Raleigh,'' say some of the ads).</p>
        <p>The campaign will also be aimed at specific industries. Those include information technology, for which there is already considerable infrastructure, according to Mr. Kucharski; advanced medical technology, which is already strong in the region, and call centers and other support services for financial institutions or insurance companies.</p>
        <p>Media buying is to begin later this month, Mr. Bean said, with the rollout of the campaign set for the fall. He anticipates devoting approximately 85 percent of the $5 million or so first-year budget to national advertising on cable television aimed at business viewers on outlets like CNN and CNBC, as well as print ads in The Wall Street Journal and sponsorship announcements on National Public Radio. The remaining 15 percent will go to local television and radio commercials and to billboard, newspaper and transit advertising in metropolitan Buffalo. There is also a Web site: www.buffaloniagara.org.</p>
        <p>The mix sounds right to Mr. Waterhouse, the consultant. ''With this plan, Buffalo has a chance to become another renaissance city,'' he said.</p>
