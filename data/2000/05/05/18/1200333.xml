        <p>Brazil caught world health authorities by surprise today by asking them to set up a database of prices of all anti-AIDS drugs, a move that would allow poor countries to shop for the best deal worldwide.</p>
        <p>The proposal has upset the world's large pharmaceutical companies because the database would have to include drugs made in countries like Brazil, India and Thailand, whose laws disregard many drug patents. Companies in those countries, and some others, make generic versions of the most important -- and most expensive -- AIDS drugs and sell them for pennies per dose.</p>
        <p>The issue is at the heart of the debate over drug prices. The major American and European drug makers argue that they alone should have the right to manufacture and sell the drugs they invented, and that any decision to offer lower prices to poor countries should be theirs, as five companies did last week in a landmark agreement with the World Health Organization.</p>
        <p>But a coalition of public health advocates, advocates for those with AIDS, third world governments and third world pharmaceutical industries argue that poor nations should be allowed to use clauses in world trade treaties that let countries facing health emergencies void the patents on life-saving drugs and make their own low-cost generic versions.</p>
        <p>For the rest of the world's poor nations -- the vast majority of which lack their own drug industries -- the database would make it easier to import cheap remedies.</p>
        <p>Brazil made its request as a surprise amendment to a resolution before the World Health Assembly, the annual meeting of all the world's health ministers at the United Nations convention center in Geneva. Today it seemed to be getting wide support.</p>
        <p>''I think the reason Brazil got so much support is that its proposal got to the heart of the matter: that countries want to be able to shop around the world for the best deals,'' said Ellen 't Hoen, a health policy consultant to Doctors Without Borders, the medical aid agency. ''That's scary to the pharmaceutical companies, because it will show that their expensive drugs are sold elsewhere at tiny fractions of their prices.''</p>
        <p>Observers from Doctors Without Borders and from Act Up, an American advocacy group for people with AIDS, both of which strongly support the Brazilian initiative, said the United States delegation initially fought it, though the Americans denied that.</p>
        <p>This evening in Geneva, it was agreed that a committee would meet on Friday to draft new amendments based on Brazil's proposal and some offered later by other countries on blood banks, traditional medicine and other issues. The committee will include representatives from countries with large pharmaceutical industries, as well as countries hit hard by AIDS.</p>
        <p>Beyond opposition from major drug companies, creating and maintaining such a database presents problems of its own. If the Brazilian amendment passed, it could put a huge burden on the organization, said Dr. Daniel Tarantola, senior policy adviser to the World Health Organization's director general, Gro Harlem Brundtland. Drug prices change constantly, so a large monitoring staff would be needed.</p>
        <p>More important, a database under the aegis of the World Health Organization, a United Nations agency, could be taken as an endorsement that all the drugs in it were safe, a representative of the international pharmaceutical industry said. The World Health Organization does not now have the money to test them.</p>
