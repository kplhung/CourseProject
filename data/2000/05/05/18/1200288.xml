        <p>ALTHOUGH many futurists have envisioned robots that could relieve humans of ordinary tasks like cooking and cleaning, people must still do most of the domestic drudge work, at least inside the house. But outdoors, the future is here, in the form of mow-bots.</p>
        <p>One of these devices is the Robomow, designed by Friendly Robotics, whose United States office is in Abilene, Tex., can propel itself around the yard, cutting the grass and even turning the clippings into mulch, eliminating raking from the to-do list.</p>
        <p>The Robomow Limited Edition Silver Classic has been on the market in Israel and Europe for about 18 months and in the United States since late last year. The latest model, the RL-500, costs $795 and will become available in the United States in June.</p>
        <p>Robomow is not the only robotic lawnmower around. Husqvarna, a Swedish manufacturer, makes two robotic mowers, including one that was introduced in 1995 and runs on solar power.</p>
        <p>Husqvarna's machines, called the Auto Mower and the Solar Mower, cost $1,999 and $3,000, respectively. Installation -- yes, installation -- costs $250 to $300.</p>
        <p>Each of these lawnmowers needs guidance from a wire that is installed around the perimeter of the yard; the wire is usually on the surface of the ground, but it can be buried a few inches underground. The mowers may be robotic, but they are not very smart. They need to be told where to go and where not to. Each mower contains sensors that detect signals from the wire and direct the machine to stay within the mowing area.</p>
        <p>Even if the mowers do what they're told, they can have some trouble with hills and tight corners.</p>
        <p>Although robotic mowers may appeal to anyone who needs to cut the grass, some people could benefit more than others from this hands-free approach.</p>
        <p>''We have a lot of people who say, 'I have waited all my life for something like this,' '' said John Bunton, products manager for Friendly Robotics. ''People with allergies, disabilities, the elderly, people with heart disease -- for the first time, a lot of these people can maintain their own lawn.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bunton said his company's machines, which use battery power for both propulsion and cutting, were environmentally friendly, with none of the air pollution and little of the noise of gas-powered mowers. He said that about 700 machines had been sold in the United States since December and that a few thousand had been sold abroad in the past 18 months.</p>
        <p>The machines from both companies look a lot like canister vacuum cleaners without hoses or attachments. The Robomow RL-500 tips the scales at 71 pounds, including its rechargeable lead-acid batteries, while the Solar Mower from Husqvarna weighs only 16 pounds.</p>
        <p>After the Robomow mows along the perimeter one or two times, it starts cutting from one side of the lawn to the other, moving over for each new path. The Solar Mower and Auto Mower turn whenever they reach the perimeter, cutting swaths of grass in angular patterns that are not repeated until all the grass is cut.</p>
        <p>The original Robomow can work for three hours before its fixed battery must be recharged; the RL-500's battery, which can be removed for recharging, works for up to two and a half hours on one charge.</p>
        <p>Husqvarna has designed its mowers to stay on the job, mowing small amounts at a time but mowing frequently.</p>
        <p>A robot mower can be hazardous for  children and small pets. ''It is deceptively quiet for a power tool,'' Mr. Bunton said. ''This has a large blade underneath it.''</p>
        <p>Although the mowers have proximity sensors so they can avoid large obstacles, the lawn must be cleared of objects, just as it would be for an ordinary mower, before a robotic mower begins work. ''It's not going to go around and pick things up for you,'' Mr. Bunton said. ''You have to make sure the hose is picked up, large limbs, toys, flip-flops.''</p>
        <p>The Robomow has a manual mode, but it is hardly the familiar push mowing of the past. The user simply follows the mower while holding a remote control keypad that is attached to the Robomow by a cord. That lets the user guide the mower without breaking a sweat.</p>
