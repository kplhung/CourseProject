      <abstract>
        <p>Prof Philip Gura has found photograph that may show 19th century poet Emily Dickinson at age 25 or 30 and is displaying it on Internet; will compare photo with her only known photo, which shows her at 17; photo (S))</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Emily Dickinson has always been a mystery. Before her death in 1886, only 10 of her more than 1,700 poems had been published. She has also been known by one photograph, taken when she was 17, but another image has surfaced which may show her at age 25 or 30 (www.unc.edu/gura/ed/index.html).</p>
        <p>Dr. Philip Gura, a professor of American literature and culture at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill who is a collector of daguerreotypes and 19th-century photographs, bought the photograph for $481 from a collector on eBay, the Internet auction site.</p>

        <p>The photograph looks like the poet and has her name and the year of her death on the back, but Dr. Gura, a forensic anthropologist, will compare the new photo with the older one to see if the physical measurements match. He will also examine the handwriting on the back to see if it matches one of her known correspondents.</p>

        <p>NEWS WATCH  Correction:  May 19, 2000, Friday  A report in the News Watch column of Circuits yesterday about the discovery of what may be a rare photograph of the poet Emily Dickinson included two sentences erroneously merged in editing. The error produced an incorrect reference to Dr. Philip Gura, professor of American literature and culture at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Dr. Gura, who bought the photograph on the eBay auction site, is not a forensic anthropologist and is not the person who will try to determine the photograph's authenticity.</p>
