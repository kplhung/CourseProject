        <p>Committees in the House and the Senate  overwhelmingly endorsed the Clinton administration's China trade bill today, contributing to a growing sense among its backers that the ardently contested measure is headed for passage.</p>
        <p>The bill, which would permanently grant China normal trading privileges, also got a plug today from Gov. George W. Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, who renewed his call on lawmakers to set aside partisan differences and back the measure.</p>
        <p>President Clinton, speaking at the  United States Coast Guard Academy, warned lawmakers that rejecting the China bill ''invites a future of dangerous confrontation and constant insecurity.''</p>
        <p>In Congress, half a dozen previously uncommitted House Republicans and Democrats announced today that they would support the legislation, a necessary step for American companies to benefit fully from a deal reached by the United States and China that paves China's way into the World Trade Organization.</p>
        <p>Administration officials and congressional backers of the measure said they believed that they might be close to the 218 votes needed for passage in the House when the bill comes to a vote next week, though they continued their heated campaign for votes.</p>
        <p>''At this point we're looking for insurance votes,'' an administration official said. But the United States trade representative, Charlene Barshefsky, said, ''The situation is still fluid.''</p>
        <p>In the House Ways and Means Committee today, four previously undeclared Democrats joined an overwhelming vote, 34 to 4, in favor of the measure. Earlier in the day, the Senate Finance Committee approved the legislation, 18 to 1. Both committees have jurisdiction over trade bills, and supporters of the China bill hailed the lopsided results for building momentum toward next week's House vote.</p>
        <p>Ms. Barshefsky, Commerce Secretary William M. Daley and other administration officials continued to buttonhole wavering members of Congress today.</p>
        <p>White House officials also said they planned to seek air time from the major television networks to allow Mr. Clinton to address the nation on Sunday night about the China bill's importance, not only for American farmers, high-tech companies and manufacturers, but also for the country's long-term security. Officials at CBS, ABC and NBC said tonight that they had not yet received the request by the White House.</p>
        <p>In Congress, critics of the measure played down the committee votes as preordained, and insisted their campaign to focus on Beijing's poor record on human rights, religious freedom, environmental standards and earlier trade accords, was working.</p>
        <p>''As Americans, we value trade, but we will never trade in our values,'' said Representative David E. Bonior of Michigan, the measure's chief Democratic opponent.</p>
        <p>Labor leaders said they would step up their lobbying of fence-sitters during the last weekend before the vote.  Opponents cited reports from an official Chinese newspaper today that threatened war with Taiwan if its president-elect, Chen Shui-bian, did not commit to a ''one-China'' policy in his inaugural speech this weekend.</p>
        <p>A senior administration official said this week that ''we're very worried about the weekend'' because the Chinese ''have a long record of saying just the wrong thing, or doing something stupid, at the last moment.''</p>
        <p>But today was a day for the China measure's supporters to cheer.</p>
        <p>To attract Democrats with heavy union constituencies, the Ways and Means Committee amended its bill by including a provision of the final trade accord negotiated in November to protect American industries from a surge in imports from China.</p>
        <p>The legislation would allow the International Trade Commission, and then the president, to halt the import of Chinese goods -- from steel to computers to a range of other products -- if they are being shipped into the United States ''in such increased quantities or under such conditions as to cause or threaten to cause market disruption to the domestic producers of like or directly competitive products.''</p>
        <p>That provision, coupled with the endorsement by the committee's ranking Democrat, Charles B. Rangel of New York, seemed to provide the final push for four Democrats who had been undecided to vote for the bill: Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, Karen L. Thurman of Florida, Lloyd Doggett of Texas and Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland.</p>
        <p>But the new provision may also plant the seeds of new American tensions with China. The definition of what constitutes a ''surge'' of imports is always a matter of dispute, and China would almost certainly take any American efforts to limit its imports to the court of the World Trade Organization for adjudication. Because it is not a W.T.O. member now, it has not been able to challenge such rulings, including a recent one blocking imports of Chinese steel.</p>
        <p>Ms. Barshefsky said today that she was not worried about such challenges. ''The Chinese know what they agreed to in November,'' she said, ''and they understood we had to have the ability to stop import surges.''</p>
        <p>If the bill is approved, it will end the need for annual renewal of China's trade status by Congress, an event that prompted heated debate over the country's human rights record and its threats against Taiwan. Every year Congress approved the trade status, even after the Tiananmen Square killings in 1989. But opponents say that by dropping the linkage between how China treats dissidents and its ability to trade with America, Congress will be giving up leverage over Beijing.</p>
        <p>To appease some of the opponents, Democrats and Republicans are completing plans for a permanent commission that will review China's human rights record annually. But labor unions and other opponents say the commission would be toothless because it only has the power to make public its findings, something the State Department does anyway in its annual human rights report.</p>
        <p>In addition to winning over some wavering Democrats, the White House picked up the support of three uncommitted Republicans: Rick Hill of Montana, Tillie Fowler of Florida and Henry J. Hyde of Illinois.</p>
        <p>Some vote-counters had already included Mr. Hill and Mrs. Fowler in their tallies, but Mr. Hyde was a coup because he has consistently voted against upgrading China's trade status in the annual review. All the Democrats from Illinois are voting against the bill, despite heavy lobbying from Ms. Barshefsky and Secretary Daley, both Chicago natives.</p>
        <p>Administration officials and their Congressional allies said they now might be less than 10 votes shy of the 218 needed for passage in the House. Republicans are expected to provide at least 150 of those votes, although two administration officials predicted today that they would get more.</p>
        <p>Democratic supporters, while upbeat that they could win 70 votes from their ranks, still voiced caution, especially after a few unexpected defections this week, like that of Representative Bob Clement of Tennessee.</p>
        <p>''We're not there yet,'' said Representative Robert T. Matsui of California, a chief Democratic vote-counter for the bill. ''It's getting harder and harder.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, two-thirds of 211 House Democrats are likely to vote against the measure, but Democratic critics of China's record on human rights, worker standards and environmental protections were vastly outnumbered in the pro-trade Ways and Means Committee today.</p>
        <p>Only four of the panel's 16 Democrats voted against the measure: Pete Stark of California, William J. Coyne of Pennsylvania, John Lewis of Georgia and Gerald D. Kleczka of Wisconsin. A fifth Democratic foe, Michael R. McNulty of New York, was absent for the vote.</p>
        <p>''It's not that I don't want to trade with China,'' Mr. Kleczka said, ''but I don't want to fling open the doors of this country and never have a review again.''</p>
        <p>In the Senate Finance Committee's vote today, all members except Senator James M. Jeffords, Republican of Vermont, voted for the bill. Mr. Jeffords said he was protesting the imprisonment of Ngawang Choepel, a Tibetan musicologist and former Fulbright scholar at Middlebury College in Vermont.</p>
        <p>Another critic of China, Senator Fred Thompson, Republican of Tennessee, voted for the trade bill, but also introduced a separate bill to monitor Beijing's sales of missile technology and other advanced weaponry to third countries.</p>
