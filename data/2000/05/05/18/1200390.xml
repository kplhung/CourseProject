        <p>Calling trade relations with China the work of ''13 years and three administrations,'' Gov. George W. Bush of Texas today urged Congressional Republicans and Democrats alike to support President Clinton and vote next week to grant China permanent trade rights.</p>

        <p>Calling trade relations with China the work of ''13 years and three administrations,'' Gov. George W. Bush of Texas today urged Congressional Republicans and Democrats alike to support President Clinton and vote next week to grant China permanent trade rights.</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Bush has long favored free trade, his address here today on the vast factory floor of a Boeing plant marked one of the very few times that he has tried publicly to affect pending legislation in Congress. He called next week's House vote ''among the most serious decisions our government will make this year.'' And he said ''no one serious about shouldering the responsibilities of the Presidency'' should remain silent.</p>
        <p>''From the start of this campaign I have defined some sharp differences with the Clinton-Gore administration,'' Mr. Bush said, a sleek Boeing 777 behind him. ''But today I want to address an important area of agreement. A pressing question now confronts the Congress and it will not wait until the next president takes office.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush drew some sharp distinctions between himself and Vice President Al Gore on China. But he portrayed the quest for a more open China, advanced through trade and the rule of law, as one that Presidents of both parties had fought for.</p>
        <p>''This is not a Republican or Democratic concern,'' Mr. Bush said. ''It is an American concern. This trade agreement is the work of 13 years and three administrations. We cannot let that work be undone.'' He did not mention his father by name, although he was one of those Presidents. But he quoted Ronald Reagan, who called free trade ''a forward strategy for freedom.''</p>
        <p>With his remarks, Mr. Bush put himself in a tradition of bipartisan cooperation on foreign policy that has increasingly been eroded in recent years. And the speech was just the latest example of his efforts to portray himself as leader willing to reach across party lines.</p>
        <p>Only a day earlier, he parted company with Senate Republicans, criticizing a bill that would set a deadline for withdrawing American ground  troops from Kosovo.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Bush said that he considered the Balkan withdrawal measure ''legislative overreach on powers of the presidency.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush made his speech in a region of the country that has been at the epicenter of the debate over trade. While Washington is oriented toward exports, nearby Seattle was also the site of last year's violent protests against the World Trade Organization.</p>
        <p>The vast Boeing plant itself showcased those divisions. The company is the nation's largest exporter, but a number of its workers said they feared China's entry into the World Trade Organization would ultimately cost Americans jobs. Indeed the area's Congressman, Representative Jack Metcalf is one of the few Republicans who are undecided on the issue. Mr. Bush, on his campaign plane this afternoon, said that he had made no telephone calls to wavering house members, but would do so if Representative Tom DeLay, the majority whip, asked for his help.</p>
        <p>The state of Washington has voted Democratic in the last three presidential elections, but Mr. Bush's aides say they are contesting the state. The employees at the Boeing plant gave Mr. Bush a generally polite reception. He drew applause and a few boos. A long line of workers waited to meet him and shake his hand after the speech.</p>
        <p>The measure cleared the House Ways and Means Committee today by a larger-than-expected margin of 34 to 4 as several undecided members sided with President Clinton. The full House, which is bitterly divided on the issue, is to vote next week on whether to grant China permanent normal trading privileges.</p>
        <p>President Clinton, who has made this one of his foreign-policy priorities for the year, argues that Congress must grant China permanent trading rights or risk hurting the competitiveness of American companies and relations with the world's most populous country.</p>
        <p>Still the vote is too close to call. And if the measure passes it will do so largely with the support of Republicans. Many Democrats have sided with organized labor, which is fighting hard against the measure, arguing that it would leave Congress few ways to press China to improve its record on human rights, labor and the environment.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has supported the bill, but has been less fervent than the President, trying to avoid the wrath of organized labor, a critical Democratic constituency.</p>
        <p>In fact, today Mr. Bush seemed a more enthusiastic ally to Mr. Clinton on the China bill than did Mr. Gore.  Saying that ''the stakes are high,'' he argued passionately for the House to approve China's entry into the World Trade Organization.</p>
        <p>''For businesses and workers and farmers it will mean lower trade barriers and important opportunities for U.S. exports and more work and jobs for United States workers,'' he said. ''For the people of East Asia, it will affect their relations with the region's major superpower. For the people of China it holds out the hope of more open contact with the world of freedom.''</p>
        <p>He did, however, use the occasion to draw distinctions between the Administration's approach to China and trade and his own. He said Mr. Clinton and Mr. Gore view China as a ''strategic partner'' and said, ''I view China as a competitor.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush also accused the administration of being inconsistent in its approach to Taiwan. And he charged that it had bungled various high- profile battles over trade. ''They failed to obtain 'fast track' trade negotiating authority,'' Mr. Bush said, ''I will fight for it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush said that while China is not a ''strategic partner,'' it is not an enemy. ''When I am the President China will have no doubts about our power and purpose in the region -- about our strong commitment to democratic allies throughout Asia,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''But this is accomplished through confident diplomacy, strong alliances, and a military to back us. It is not accomplished by hindering free trade or seeking to isolate China.''</p>
        <p>Boeing workers were divided on the issue. Before Mr. Bush spoke Jon J. Walker, 46, a tool maker, said he opposed normal trade with China because it would result in the loss of American manufacturing jobs. ''We know that labor is cheaper elsewhere,'' he said. ''We can't compete with somebody who's living in a  cardboard box.'' He said he was a Democrat who would vote for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>Afterward, Charles Webb, 42, a mechanic, said that he was a unionized worker who does not ''follow the union line.'' But he said he was uncertain about China trade because ''I'm not confident with China's human rights record.'' He took a dim view of both candidates. ''I'm not going to vote for Gore -- that's a definite,'' Mr. Webb said. ''Vote for Mr. Bush? I'd prefer not to. But that may be my only choice.''</p>
