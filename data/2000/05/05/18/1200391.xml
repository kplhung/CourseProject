        <p>Throughout their bitter contest for the Democratic Senate nomination from New Jersey, Jim Florio has demonized Jon S. Corzine for supporting a ''risky scheme'' to extend the solvency of Social Security by investing government money in the stock market.</p>
        <p>In their first three debates, Mr. Florio has described Mr. Corzine's position as ''a colossally bad idea'' and as the ''defining issue in the campaign.''</p>
        <p>But just over a year ago, before Mr. Corzine officially entered the race, Mr. Florio publicly endorsed the exact same idea.</p>
        <p>At an appearance before some 30 Jewish leaders on May 4, 1999, Mr. Florio said he had ''no difficulty'' with a limited investment of the Social Security trust fund in stocks, according to a newly discovered tape recording of his remarks.</p>
        <p>These days, whenever Mr. Corzine likens the idea to the investment strategies of private or public pension funds, Mr. Florio responds cuttingly. ''That just tells you that Jon doesn't understand the difference between private pension funds and Social Security,'' Mr. Florio said in a radio debate on Monday.</p>
        <p>But in the May 1999 appearance, Mr. Florio used the same analogy, according to the tape recording, excerpts of which are to be published by The New Jersey Jewish News on Thursday. A reporter for The Jewish News discovered the year-old recording last week, after Mr. Florio questioned the newspaper's accuracy.</p>
        <p>Confronted with the tape recording, Jim Lanard, a spokesman for Mr. Florio, said today that Mr. Florio ''must have misspoken, and he failed to complete his thoughts regarding his views on Social Security.''</p>
        <p>But on the tape, Mr. Florio can be plainly heard contrasting his own views on Social Security investment with those of some Republicans, who favor privatization: a plan in which people would be able to divert some of their Social Security payroll taxes into their own individual investment accounts. ''I take that off the table,'' Mr. Florio says about the Republican idea on the tape.</p>
        <p>''The other issue is the question of whether you put public dollars into the marketplace,'' he continues. ''But again, this is a matter of degree. I have no difficulty with a relatively small, segmented portion of the Social Security trust fund monies being put into equities, and we should put them in, in the same way that we put those types of resources into teachers' funds and other public agencies.''</p>
        <p>The Jewish News, a weekly with a circulation of about 35,000, actually reported Mr. Florio's support for stock market investment of Social Security money on May 13, 1999, in a single sentence near the end of an article about Mr. Florio's appearance before members of the Association of Jewish Federations of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>But it did not become an issue in the Senate campaign until January, when Mr. Corzine's aides found the article and seized on it as evidence that Mr. Florio had ''flip-flopped'' on Social Security.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio insisted that the reporter for The Jewish News had simply misquoted him. Relying only on the reporter's notes, the newspaper stood by its account, and the matter faded away.</p>
        <p>But in last Thursday's debate, Mr. Florio again disputed the article's accuracy, noting that he had not been quoted directly and saying that ''the reporter indicated there may have been some misunderstanding by her.''</p>
        <p>In response, the newspaper's editor, David Twersky, said today that he had asked the reporter to produce her notes, and that she then found the tape recording. ''I was tired of the paper's credibility being besmirched,'' Mr. Twersky said.</p>
        <p>A spokesman for Mr. Corzine, Steven Goldstein, said today that the contretemps over what Mr. Florio had said a year ago ''underscores everything voters hate about Jim Florio and professional politicians: one, they lie, and two, they're arrogant. Jim Florio lied about taxes in 1989, and he's been lying about Social Security in 2000.</p>
        <p>''Jim Florio's arrogance is that he never had the courage to admit, 'Look, I've changed my position,' or that 'My position has evolved,' '' Mr. Goldstein added.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lanard, the Florio spokesman, denied that Mr. Florio had experienced a change of heart during the Senate campaign and insisted that he had opposed any investment of Social Security money in the stock market well before the May 1999 appearance. ''His position is rock solid,'' Mr. Lanard said. ''He has never wavered from that position.''</p>
