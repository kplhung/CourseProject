        <p>Second Thoughts About a Debut</p>
        <p>On the way from a celebrity screening of WOODY ALLEN'S new film, ''Small Time Crooks,'' to the party afterward, STEVE KROFT took a detour. Mr. Kroft, a correspondent on ''60 Minutes'' who appeared in the film in a newsmagazine-style segment about the fictional nouveaux riches played by Mr. Allen and TRACEY ULLMAN, went to a bar and reflected on his movie debut.

        <p>By the time he left the bar and headed to the party, he had decided the answers were no and no. ''It's a pretty big shock seeing yourself on a big screen, let me tell you,'' he said. ''My wife can tell you, I was totally freaked out, but I've gotten over it.''</p>

        <p>Second Thoughts About a Debut</p>
        <p>On the way from a celebrity screening of WOODY ALLEN'S new film, ''Small Time Crooks,'' to the party afterward, STEVE KROFT took a detour. Mr. Kroft, a correspondent on ''60 Minutes'' who appeared in the film in a newsmagazine-style segment about the fictional nouveaux riches played by Mr. Allen and TRACEY ULLMAN, went to a bar and reflected on his movie debut. ''Thirty years in the business, and I thought: 'Did I make some horrible mistake here? Did I just throw my career away?' ''</p>
        <p>By the time he left the bar and headed to the party, he had decided the answers were no and no. ''It's a pretty big shock seeing yourself on a big screen, let me tell you,'' he said. ''My wife can tell you, I was totally freaked out, but I've gotten over it.''</p>
        <p>Freaked out?</p>
        <p>''It's like the first time you see yourself on television, you hate the way you look,'' he said, ''and there are movie stars who will tell you they don't go to screenings. I'm used to seeing myself on television, on '60 Minutes' or on the evening news. When you pop up in a Woody Allen movie, it's just different.''</p>
        <p>He said he had cleared his film appearance with ANDREW HEYWARD, the president of CBS News, and was not concerned that he had blurred the distinction between news and entertainment. ''All of us here have been in 'Murphy Brown,' '' he said. ''Even Charles Kuralt was in 'Murphy Brown,' and so was Walter Cronkite, so that line has sort of been crossed. I think it depends a lot on the material and the circumstances.''</p>
        <p>There were moments when ''Small Time Crooks'' sounded like an homage to ''The Honeymooners,'' with the bus driver husband who who regularly threatened his wife with a fist-propelled trip to the moon. Mr. Allen, playing a thief-turned-dishwasher, told his wife, ''I'd like to flatten you once.'' The similarity was no accident. Mr. Allen considers ''The Honeymooners'' ''the greatest television sitcom of all time.''</p>
        <p>''That show really made an impression on me because it reminded me of my parents,'' he said. ''They were always insulting one another, constantly going back and forth. It was done with a taunting kind of humor, but the love was always there.''</p>
        <p>Still, no one in ''The Honeymooners'' ever became a socialite or an intellectual. Ms. Ullman, as the wife in ''Small Time Crooks,'' tried to force such a transformation on Mr. Allen's character, not on Mr. Allen himself.</p>
        <p>''I'm acting when I play an intellectual in films,'' he said. ''I look like I'm an intellectual because I wear glasses and have a slight build. But I'm much closer in real life to the character I played in 'Take the Money and Run' or 'Broadway Danny Rose' or  Ray, the character in this film. I'm comfortable at home, with a glass of beer, watching the Knicks or the Yankees or a boxing match. That's really who I am. When  I play an intellectual, it's much more difficult.''</p>
        <p>Cooking Trophy From Bocuse</p>
        <p>The French chef PAUL BOCUSE has a reputation among chefs for being at best lukewarm about women in his profession. ''Women lack the instincts for great cooking,'' he declared in 1975. ''Women who become chefs are limited in their accomplishments. They have one or two dishes they accomplish very well, but they are not great innovators.''</p>
        <p>Times have changed. On Monday, at the French Consulate on Fifth Avenue, he gave an award to a woman,  TRACY O'GRADY, the sous-chef at Kinkead's in Washington.</p>
        <p>She will represent the United States at the Bocuse d'Or competition in France next year, a cook-off established by Mr. Bocuse in 1987. The award to Ms. O'Grady was the Craig Claiborne trophy, named for a longtime food writer and restaurant critic for The New York Times who died in January.</p>
        <p>''If she wins, it will be great for women,'' Mr. Bocuse said. He was one of a handful of the dozens of chefs at the gathering who was not in a white uniform, but he was the only one with the medal of Commander of the National Order of Merit. The consul-general, RICHARD DUQUE, had presented it to him earlier in the evening.</p>
