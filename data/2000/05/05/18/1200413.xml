        <p>When James J. Cramer, the co-founder of TheStreet.com, went on TheStreet.com's cable television program and plugged TheStreet.com's own stock, he set off a battle over the ethics of stock promotion that may result in cancellation of the program.</p>
        <p>In a highly unusual war of news releases yesterday, TheStreet.com announced that it was canceling its program, which appears each weekend on the Fox News Channel, a cable channel. Fox fired back that TheStreet.com had no right to cancel it, and TheStreet.com relented and said it would keep producing the program for an undetermined period.</p>

        <p>When James J. Cramer, the co-founder of TheStreet.com, went on TheStreet.com's cable television program and plugged TheStreet.com's own stock, he set off a battle over the ethics of stock promotion that may result in cancellation of the program.</p>
        <p>In a highly unusual war of news releases yesterday, TheStreet.com announced that it was canceling its program, which appears each weekend on the Fox News Channel, a cable channel. Fox fired back that TheStreet.com had no right to cancel it, and TheStreet.com relented and said it would keep producing the program for an undetermined period.</p>
        <p>While Fox and TheStreet.com were exchanging salvos, Mr. Cramer was said by his office to be unavailable because he was attending his daughter's birthday party.</p>
        <p>The dispute was set off by a program taped April 14 and broadcast April 15, the weekend after the Nasdaq stock market suffered its worst day ever. Mr. Cramer, who is a hedge-fund manager as well as a commentator for TheStreet.com, mentioned a number of stocks, including the American Home Products Corporation, which he said was his biggest stock position and one he was buying.</p>
        <p>Then, after a commercial, Mr. Cramer was asked for another forecast. He replied, ''Stock that's near and dear to my heart that I own a lot of is stock called TheStreet.com. I've watched it go from $70 to $5. I think it's done going down because it's got $4.75 in cash.''</p>
        <p>Fox left that in when it broadcast the program, but put a notice on the screen that Mr. Cramer was the largest shareholder and a co-founder of TheStreet.com, an Internet site that provides news and commentary on financial markets.</p>
        <p>The comment brought immediate criticism. Dave Kansas, the editor in chief of TheStreet.com, published a column the next day on TheStreet .com Web site criticizing Mr. Cramer for making the comment and noting that before the program was taped he had refused to say what he planned to recommend, as participants usually did. ''I don't like Cramer or anyone else discussing our stock on the show or on the site,'' Mr. Kansas wrote.</p>
        <p>Then, on April 26, The Daily News printed an article in which an unnamed Fox spokesman criticized Mr. Cramer. ''Despite offering full disclosure of his ownership position, we do not approve of the touting of stock for personal gain on the air,'' the spokesman was quoted as saying. The article quoted Mr. Cramer as saying there was no personal gain because he had no intention of selling any shares.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, in announcing that TheStreet.com was canceling the program, Thomas Clarke, the chief executive, said that amounted to a breach of contract because Fox has unilaterally changed policies regarding the program.</p>
        <p>He pointed to The Daily News article as being a statement of Fox's new policy, which he said went beyond TheStreet.com's policy of requiring that all participants disclose any interests they have in stocks they discuss. ''It would be interesting to know if they had the policy for their other shows, where people come on and talk about stocks without any disclosure,'' Mr. Clarke said in an interview, speaking of Fox News, a unit of the News Corporation.</p>
        <p>Asked about that, Diane Brandi, a Fox News vice president, replied that it was ''an absurd premise. We do not announce policies in The Daily News.'' She declined to say just what the station's policy was, or whether it allowed Mr. Cramer to recommend stocks his hedge fund owns, as he regularly does.</p>
        <p>But she did say that Mr. Cramer, who has not appeared on the program since the incident, would be in violation of his contract with Fox if he did not appear this weekend, since his contract called for a minimum number of annual appearances. Mr. Clarke said that the program would be taped, as part of an orderly shutdown of the broadcast, but that Mr. Cramer would not appear. Fox has two separate contracts, one with TheStreet.com to make the program and another with Mr. Cramer providing for him to appear on it and limiting his appearances on other networks.</p>
        <p>There may be other things at work here. In the days after Mr. Cramer recommended the stock on Fox, he appeared on a Cable News Network program and then on NBC's ''Today'' show. Ms. Brandi said those appearances violated his contract with Fox. Mr. Clarke speculated that Fox's anger over those appearances had led Fox to criticize Mr. Cramer in the first place.</p>
        <p>One person on the Fox side, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said the affair might somehow be related to a Fox refusal in March to invest more money in TheStreet.com, in which Fox now owns a 1.6 percent stake. Mr. Clarke said he had sought a greater strategic alliance with Fox, but not because TheStreet.com needed cash.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Cramer was not available for comment, his assistant at his hedge fund issued a statement saying Mr. Cramer ''is totally on board with TheStreet.com's decision. We were proud of the show, but it didn't work out as we had hoped.''</p>
        <p>The Street.com went public last May at $19 a share and traded as high as $71.25 the first day. But it soon slid, and reached its low of $5.50 on April 14, the day Mr. Cramer made his comments. Yesterday it rose 87.5 cents, to $7.9375.</p>
        <p>The New York Times Company  owns a 6.3 percent stake in TheStreet.com and operates a joint newsroom with it that files articles for the Web sites of both TheStreet.com and The New York Times.</p>
