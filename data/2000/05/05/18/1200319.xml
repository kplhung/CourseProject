        <p>Remember When</p>
        <p>From around the world come the 50 artists whose paintings, sculptures, projections, photographs and mixed media works propel ''Around 1984: A Look at Art in the 80's.'' The first in a series of shows examining decades, this show opens on Sunday and runs through September at the P. S. 1 Contemporary Art Center, 22-25 Jackson Avenue at 46th Avenue in Long Island City. Among the artists are Jean-Michel Basquiat, Tony Cragg, Jenny Holzer, Anselm Kiefer, Jeff Koons and Julian Schnabel.</p>
        <p>Causal Relationships</p>
        <p>The title is ''A Grand Night for Singing,'' and the lineup includes names like Kaye Ballard, Celeste Holm, Lee Roy Reams, KT Sullivan, Julie Wilson and Ronnie Whyte. The host at the refreshment table is none other than Gwen Verdon. The event, at 6 p.m. on Monday, is a benefit for the Theater at Holy Cross, in the Church of the Holy Cross, at 329 West 42nd Street, where Susan Mansur and Michael Bahr will be playing tonight through Saturday at 8 and on Sunday at 3 p.m. in A. R. Gurney's ''Love Letters.''</p>
        <p>African Focus</p>
        <p>In what is billed as her first New York appearance in nearly a decade, the Grammy Award-winning South African vocalist Miriam Makeba will perform at 8 p.m. on Saturday at City Center in ''Badenya 2000: Voices of Hope,'' a presentation spotlighting the performing arts of Africa in America. Ms. Makeba will offer many of the traditional songs that brought her international renown, as well as material from ''Homeland,'' her first new studio recording in six years. On the program with her will be traditional artists from Gambia, Guinea, Nigeria and Mali who are based in New York.</p>
        <p>Devotion to Art</p>
        <p>Forty major works in limestone by the self-taught sculptor William Edmondson (1874-1951) go on view on Saturday at the Museum of American Folk Art, 2 Lincoln Square, on Columbus Avenue between 65th and 66th Streets. The exhibition, through Aug. 27, is described as the first full-scale Edmondson retrospective since 1937, when he became the first African-American artist to have a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art. Providing a contextual background are 45 photographs of Edmondson and his environment by Edward Weston, Consuelo Kanaga and Louise Dahl-Wolfe.</p>
        <p>Laurels</p>
        <p>Receiving honorary doctorates tomorrow at the commencement ceremonies of the Juilliard School in Alice Tully Hall will be Jacques d'Amboise, founder of the National Dance Institute; Vartan Gregorian, president of the Carnegie Corporation of New York; the soprano Barbara Hendricks, a Juilliard graduate; James Levine, artistic director of the Metropolitan Opera, and the  actor and Juilliard alumnus Kevin Spacey.</p>
