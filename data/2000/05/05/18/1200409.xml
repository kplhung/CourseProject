        <p>Even for dedicated archaeologists of Brooklyn's ancient civic grudges, it is hard to pinpoint which aspect of the Missing Eagle Affair has inflicted the most insult. The list of perceived snubs is long, and growing longer by the day.</p>
        <p>It begins with the New York City Parks and Recreation Department, which for 38 years -- through 6 mayors and 11 parks commissioners -- has stubbornly refused to return four eagle statues to Fort Greene Park, where for half a century they stood at a monument for Revolutionary War dead.</p>
        <p>''I feel like Rip Van Winkle,'' said Roy G. Vanasco, a Brooklyn merchant who was the first to raise the alarm about the missing eagles back in the mid-1960's.</p>
        <p>Worse still, for two decades the eagles have been shown off in the Manhattan headquarters of Parks and Recreation. In Brooklyn there are poisonous rumors -- categorically denied -- that Henry J. Stern, the parks commissioner, and his aides use the eagles as hat stands.</p>
        <p>More insult is found in the Parks Department's main argument against  returning the eagles: the statues must be protected from vandalism and theft. Naturally, some Brooklynites interpret this as a slur on the borough's character. Asked why he would not, for the sake of diplomacy, simply move the eagles to the office of the Brooklyn borough president, Howard Golden, Mr. Stern replied, ''We're not going to do that -- put them in a space where we can't guarantee their safety.'' Ouch.</p>
        <p>Then there is the most recent slight. Mr. Stern has offered to return the eagles to Fort Greene Park, but only if they are placed on 10-foot columns rather than the original knee-high pedestals, where they were within easy reach of vandals. Brooklyn military veterans are enraged, calling the plan a desecration of hallowed ground. Anthony R. Ibelli 3rd, a veteran who heads a local landmarks committee, puts it this way: ''If you're restoring a 1940 Ford, are you going to throw a Chevy steering wheel in it?''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern ridiculed such concerns as ''irredentist claims'' by ''Brooklyn superpatriots.''</p>
        <p>The eagle, majestic symbol of freedom, has come to represent something else in Brooklyn: wounded pride. Resentment. The acidic feeling that snobby Manhattan is once again looking down its patrician nose at Brooklyn, as if it were an uncouth relative, not to be trusted with the family silver.</p>
        <p>''That is what's so insulting about this whole affair,'' said Robert Evans, chairman of Community Board 2, which includes Fort Greene Park.</p>
        <p>Embellished by sentiment and time, the eagles have taken on the status of hostages. People in Brooklyn talk of the eagles' being spirited across the East River by bureaucratic plunderers of Brooklyn's history. They make comparisons to the villains who stole the Dodgers. The Dodgers may be gone for good, but Brooklyn's civic leaders vow that the eagles, by God, will come home.</p>
        <p>Manhattan, truth be told, had nothing to do with the monument in the first place. ''It was all a Brooklyn initiative; it was Brooklyn money,'' said Ruth Learned Goldstein, chairwoman of the Committee for the Restoration of Fort Greene Park. ''The eagles,'' she said, ''are just so symbolic.''</p>
        <p>One might expect the fight for the eagles to unite Brooklyn's diverse  partisans. Instead it has spawned factions that accuse each other of harassment and back-stabbing. They argue about who is the most authentic Brooklynite, and they fuss over the true meaning of the eagles.</p>
        <p>Military veterans like Mr. Ibelli disparage Ms. Goldstein and her supporters as ''draft-dodging flower planters'' who are too willing to accept the design whims of Henry Stern. Ms. Goldstein disparages Mr. Ibelli and his supporters as bumbling ''amateur historians.''</p>
        <p>There is more sniping between Mr. Golden, who first seized on the eagle issue in 1998, and City Councilwoman Mary Pinkett, whose political turf includes Fort Greene Park.</p>
        <p>''Everyone,'' Ms. Pinkett said tartly, ''wants to claim the park.''</p>
        <p>Now, because of what Mr. Stern calls the ''total turmoil'' among the monument factions in Brooklyn, it appears unlikely that the eagles will be returned this year for the park's 150th anniversary. ''Until there is detente in Brooklyn,'' he said, ''I don't see the point in spending $1 million to risk the eagles and stir up further controversy.''</p>
        <p>The eagles were placed near the Prison Ship Martyrs Monument, a 148-foot-tall Doric column set in a broad square atop a hill in Fort Greene Park. The monument, designed by Stanford White and dedicated in 1908, commemorates 11,500 men, women and children who died on British prison ships moored in nearby Wallabout Bay during the Revolutionary War.</p>
        <p>The eagles faced the monument from the square's four corners, each secured at the base of an eight-foot column. As park maintenance logs show, the eagles were repeatedly attacked over the decades. Claws were hacked off. Wings were snapped. In 1962, two eagles were stolen. Though both were soon recovered, parks officials had had enough. They put all four into storage in Manhattan, and thus began today's fight.</p>
        <p>Leading the charge was Mr. Vanasco, who owns an appliance store on Myrtle Avenue and is active in local politics. For years, he said, parks officials gave him the runaround about the eagles' whereabouts. Finally, Joseph P. Bresnan, director of monuments for the city's parks, sent a letter to Mr. Vanasco assuring him that the eagles were ''undergoing repair and refitting before they can be re-installed.'' The work, he wrote in early 1974, should be done by spring.</p>
        <p>It did not happen. Mr. Bresnan, now a private architect, said he feared putting them back because city parks had been plagued by thefts of bronze statues. ''We lost a lot of stuff,'' he said. ''I couldn't let that happen to the eagles.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vanasco and his compatriots suggested a different plan. If the eagles were not safe at the park, why not display them in Brooklyn's major public institutions, like the Central Library and Borough Hall? Sure, Mr. Bresnan replied in a 1979 letter. He promised that the eagles would be returned ''as soon as I can visit the sites'' to check on security.</p>
        <p>Still, the eagles did not come.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bresnan said he could not recall why. But a newspaper photograph, also from 1979, showed Parks Commissioner Gordon Davis smiling in his office, two of the eagles in the background.</p>
        <p>A few years later, Mr. Vanasco tried again with the city's new parks commissioner, Henry Stern. ''I once again come before your agency,'' he wrote in 1983, ''to demand our Bronze Eagles, which are standing at the entrance to your office.'' The appeal did nothing.</p>
        <p>''Everything,'' Mr. Vanasco said, ''was always going to be soon. That was always the word. They would talk about so-called vandalism, but to me, what they were really saying was, 'I enjoy having them in my office.' ''</p>
        <p>Not so, Mr. Stern insisted, emphatically noting that none of the eagles are in his office per se. Two eagles flank the entrance to his executive office suite in the Arsenal, on the eastern side of Central Park; two stand in a conference room he often uses. They remain there, he said, not for aesthetics but because they are safe. ''They're objects of art,'' he said, ''but I wouldn't use them to decorate a living room.''</p>
        <p>The problem, he said, is that for 38 years Brooklyn's political leaders have not come up with a plan and the money for the eagles' safe return. Couldn't the Parks Department, with its $175 million budget, have come up with a plan and the money? ''Not without elected officials' demanding it,'' Mr. Stern said. What about Community Board 2, which began demanding the eagles two decades ago? Community boards, he replied, are appointed.</p>
        <p>A resolution finally seemed at hand in 1998, when Mr. Golden set aside $850,000 from his budget to have the eagles brought back to the park and the pillars rebuilt. Ransom money, it was called by some of the old-timers. Yet two years later Mr. Golden finds himself with a political mess because he supported the plan to put the eagles on top of the columns as Brooklyn's veterans lined up to condemn it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ibelli rallied support during a recent meeting in a Brooklyn armory with the Veterans Committee of Kings and Richmond Counties. In a room decorated with eight American flags, Mr. Ibelli passed around old photographs -- ''This here is a Doric column'' -- as he explained why the eagles must be restored just as they were in 1962.</p>
        <p>The columns, he said, citing several books on the symbolism of military monuments, were intended to look unfinished as a symbol of the unfinished lives claimed by the ghastly prison ships. Likewise, he said, the eagles were placed at the foot of the columns -- wings spread in an aggressive posture -- for a special reason. ''He's going to stay there on the ground to protect our first veterans,'' Mr. Ibelli said.</p>
        <p>''You put him on top, who's he going to defend?''</p>
        <p>It was a call to arms, and the veterans were eager to join up. Mr. Stern is unmoved. No way, he said, will he risk putting the eagles back in their original spots. ''They might as well be demonstrating against the World Trade Organization,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Last week, Community Board 2 voted overwhelmingly to reject the Parks Department's plan.</p>
        <p>And so, after 38 years, it comes down to this: Roy Vanasco, the original eagle crusader, finds he is back where he began -- arguing that fears of vandalism are insulting and overblown, that Brooklyn should be trusted to treat the eagles right, that fancy plans and lavish $850,000 budgets are ''plain stupidity,'' and that Mr. Stern is looking for another excuse to hang on to some lovely art.</p>
        <p>''I don't care how long it takes,'' he said, undaunted. ''They're going back to where they were. They don't belong anyplace else.''</p>
