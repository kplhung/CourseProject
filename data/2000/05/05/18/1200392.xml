        <p>There was no Christmas vacation this year at the Omaha Nation Public School, and no spring break either. Instead, the superintendent, Todd Chessmore, decided to front load the school calendar so classes would end a few weeks early, the first week of May.</p>
        <p>This was his effort to stem a chronically high truancy rate that gets worse in the spring, when warmer weather and the end of the high school basketball season dampen students' interest in school.</p>
        <p>It was not entirely successful. In the math class taught by Mr. Chessmore, for example, only 5 of the 36 registered students were showing up by mid-April.</p>
        <p>Even in a country used to stories about struggling public schools, many of those on Indian reservations stand out. Last year, the average student at the Omaha Nation Public School scored in the 15th percentile on national standardized tests, and almost half scored below the 10th percentile. Fewer than half the students in grades 3 through 12 came to take the test, Mr. Chessmore said. And while this year's graduating class of 9 is twice as big as those of a few years ago, it represents only a third of the 27 students enrolled in that class in ninth grade.</p>
        <p>The obstacles the Omaha Nation school wrestles with are echoed in Indian schools around the country. On average, 36 percent to 51 percent of Indian students drop out of high school, according to the American Indian College Fund, the largest dropout rate of any ethnic group. Only about 17 percent of high school graduates go to college, and most do not finish.</p>
        <p>''We got the worst of everything, the lowest test scores, lowest rate of reading books, the highest dropout rate, the lowest rate of entering college,'' said Dean Chavers, director of the Native American Scholarship Fund.</p>
        <p>Frustrated by years of distressing results, schools and groups like the National Indian Education Association have begun pressing states and the federal government for more money for academics and crumbling buildings, programs to train Indian teachers, and support for parents whose poverty, substance abuse or unemployment leave them unmotivated or unable to help their children stay in school and achieve.</p>
        <p>It reflects Indian country's increasing ability to assert itself, as Indian leaders have gained political and legal savvy and a degree of economic empowerment through reservation casinos. But it also reflects the critical state of Indian education.</p>
        <p>''Whatever test you're looking at, Indian kids in high school typically score at the 15th or 20th percentile, Mr. Chavers said. ''The reading of those kids is absolutely nonexistent. Our Indian kids are leaving high school now with Algebra 1 -- no geometry, no trig -- and people wonder why they're failing out of college.''</p>
        <p>Some reservation schools have done well, and others, including the Omaha Nation school, have improved from a few years ago. But many are dealing with a cycle of low expectations from non-Indian teachers, a generation of poorly educated parents, broken and overwhelmed families, a society historically suspicious of government-run schools and a culture that may not always see the relationship between being academically rigorous and being successful on the reservation. These difficulties only compound the isolation and poverty of reservation life.</p>
        <p>''I worry about the future of the tribe,'' said Denine Parker, an Omaha tribe member who teaches art at the school in Macy, where 60 percent of the 3,400 tribe members are unemployed. ''I see too many kids not getting an education. What happens to them? All you have to do is walk Main Street and then you know.''</p>
        <p>To some degree, state and federal officials are responding. President Clinton's budget request this year includes the largest increase ever for Indian education, economic and social programs -- $1.2 billion -- which would put it at $9.4 billion in 2001.</p>
        <p>The Education Department just created an Indian Teacher Corps to train 1,000 Indian teachers. Currently, most teachers in reservation schools are non-Indian, the turnover rates are extremely high and many believe that the teachers do not understand Indian culture and learning styles.</p>
        <p>And in August, a task force created by Mr. Clinton will present plans to improve education of the nation's 600,000 Indian students, 90 percent of whom are in public schools, many on reservations.</p>
        <p>''What's important is that what the government is doing says it's O.K. to be an Indian,'' said David Cournoyer, director of external affairs for the American Indian College Fund. ''Before, the philosophy was to take the Indian out of the Indian and basically educate him to be a white person. Now there's a recognition that the Indians' background and identity and self-esteem is important to them being good students.''</p>
        <p>Dr. David Beaulieu, the director of Indian education at the Education Department, called the effort unprecedented.</p>
        <p>''We have schools that are literally falling down around the heads of Indian children,'' Mr. Beaulieu said. ''In the 1990's we had the same high levels of dropout rates and low achievement levels as existed 20 years before.''</p>
        <p>In Nebraska, the efforts of Mr. Chessmore and others got the state to hold an Indian education summit and appoint a panel to improve state policy. The Legislature passed a bill this session changing the state aid formula so that tribes, which have very little taxable property, would no longer lose state financing because they could not raise the required amount from property taxes. The bill was vetoed by Gov. Mike Johanns, a Republican, and the Omaha Nation and Winnebago school districts plan to sue the state.</p>
        <p>Chris Peterson, a spokesman for Mr. Johanns, said that while the governor objected to the cost and form of the bill, he also believed ''it is time for the state and federal government to step up and do more, specifically in the area of funding.''</p>
        <p>And Nebraska's education commissioner, Doug Christensen, is hiring two staff members solely for Indian students: an education expert and a drug and alcohol counselor.</p>
        <p>''We're really courting disaster, I think, on those reservation communities,'' Mr. Christensen said. ''In two of our reservation schools there are 44 kindergartners but only 2 seniors, and in one case those 2 kids should not be graduating. They are two 18-year-old girls who couldn't pass the Algebra 1 test to save their soul. But what else can you do with them?''</p>
        <p>Bob Geist, principal of the Winnebago reservation school, north of Macy, said: ''Some parents see formal education as important; others see just being with the family as education. We have parents who will take kids out of school just to go shopping, or schedule a haircut in the middle of the day.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Parker, the Omaha Nation teacher, sent her daughter to sixth  grade at a non-Indian school in Iowa. Recently, her daughter returned to the Omaha Nation school to find she was ''way ahead of the sixth graders here,'' Ms. Parker said. ''If I never would have sent her away, she never would have realized how hard she has to work.''</p>
        <p>Still, at Omaha Nation, Mr. Chessmore has made many improvements, from replacing 300 burned-out light bulbs when he started as superintendent three years ago to opening a day care center to help girls who have babies stay in school.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chessmore started a training program for Indian teachers that will increase their numbers to 20 from 4, made the curriculum more culturally relevant by including tribal language, history and customs. He has also applied for money for a social services center with probation officers and a mental health counselor. He got a grant for a reading program for elementary students, which he says has produced ''fourth graders who are reading better than half our high school.'' And he is lobbying the telephone company to give phones to the 30 percent of students' families without them.</p>
        <p>To build trust, Mr. Chessmore, unlike most other superintendents and teachers in reservation schools, enrolled his 7 children at Omaha Nation, the only non-Indians among the 470 students. He and his wife also rear 4 Indian students from troubled families.</p>
        <p>He hired three truant officers, and the truancy rate fell to about 15 percent from 31 percent.</p>
        <p>One afternoon, Waylon Oldman, a truant officer and tribe member, scoured Macy for two kindergartners who had left school. In a Buick with its windshield cracked by rock-throwing truants, Mr. Oldman visited one truant's father and the trailer where the other truant lived with his grandmother. He scaled a chalky ridge called Million Dollar Hill, poked in an abandoned cellar shrouded by trees, scrambled down a deep ravine under a bridge, and combed an algae-choked creek strewn with old tires on the powwow grounds. The boys were nowhere to be found.</p>
        <p>''The kids are smart -- they arrange tree branches so they can scoot underneath but we have to work to get through,'' Mr. Oldman said.</p>
        <p>He said that tribal court had begun fining parents whose children were  chronically truant and that the school sometimes tried to get their welfare benefits cut. ''Some parents are really concerned,'' Mr Oldman said, ''but some of the parents don't really understand why they need to send the kids to school.''</p>
        <p>One chronic truant was T. J. Baxter, 16, whose mother, Janice, would take him to school in the morning. But Mrs. Baxter said that ''in the afternoon, I would see him walking around with friends.'' T. J. kept ''coming home drunk, '' she said, and  she sent him to a treatment center.</p>
        <p>Some students show promise but do not follow through. This year, it looked as though Jason Miller, a senior on the basketball team, would graduate, but he stopped doing schoolwork when basketball season ended.</p>
        <p>''I didn't really want to come to school no more,'' said Jason, 18.</p>
        <p>But there have been successes.</p>
        <p>One senior, Liz Parker, had slacked off too badly to graduate. But a few weeks ago, Mr. Chessmore refused to let his daughter double date with her to the prom unless Liz did enough work to graduate. She did.</p>
        <p>And Adrienne Miller, 19, who was  left back in ninth grade and was drinking so much last year she dropped out for two weeks, turned things around under pressure from her mother, who told her she would have to help pay the bills if she was not in school. Now she will graduate and plans to attend college.</p>
        <p>''I finally realized what I should be doing,'' Adrienne wrote in a class essay. ''Getting my education.''</p>
