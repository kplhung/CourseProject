        <p>''It's like seeing my library come alive,'' one architect gasped at the opening of ''At the End of the Century: 100 Years of Architecture,'' an exhibition at the Museum of Contemporary Art at the Geffen Contemporary here. Ambitiously conceived by Richard Koshalek, the former director of the museum, the show is on its last stop after a two-year international tour. The breathtaking collection of models, photographs and drawings charts the course of 20th-century architecture and urbanism. It is arranged in themes, like the Politics of Monumentality in 1930's Architecture (''Let's Transform Moscow Into a Model Socialist City of the Proletarian State,'' 1931, above); Structural Expressionism (Le Corbusier's 1951 chapel at Ronchamp, France, middle) and housing in the 1920's and 1930's (right, Karl-Marx-Hof, Vienna, 1927). The exhibition's design lacks the pizazz of its contents (it is about as alive as a library), so it may lack the wide appeal it deserves. Geffen Contemporary is at 152 North Central Avenue, Los Angeles, (213) 626-6222.</p>
