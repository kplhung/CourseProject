        <p>Use of electric stun belts and restraint chairs, which human rights groups say is widespread in the United States, almost inevitably violates the international treaty against torture, according to a United Nations monitoring group.</p>
        <p>The United Nations Committee Against Torture, which examines compliance of 118 countries that have ratified the 1984 pact, also cited as problem areas in the United States police brutality, chain gangs, sexual assaults of female prisoners by law enforcement officials and detention of minors.</p>
        <p>The committee's panel of 10 human rights experts urged American  officials to ''abolish electroshock stun belts and restraint chairs as methods of restraining those in custody,'' on the ground that their use ''almost invariably leads to breaches'' of the treaty, which the United States ratified in 1994.</p>
        <p>There was no immediate response from the administration, whose representatives received the recommendations on Monday without comment.</p>
        <p>Stun belts, which are placed around prisoners' waists, are used in as many as 100 United States jurisdictions. The Clinton administration's top human rights official, Harold H. Koh, argued that no lawsuits had been brought that substantiate the accusations of death or serious injuries to prisoners from such restraints.</p>
        <p>He said that such devices are used only to transport dangerous inmates.</p>
        <p>In its first review of the American  record on torture and other cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, the committee also asked Washington to ''ensure that minors are not held in prison with the regular prison population.''</p>
        <p>The committee's conclusions were  in response to last week's American  government report, which is required for all countries that have ratified the United Nations Convention Against Torture. The United States was nearly five years late filing its report.</p>
