        <p>Ethiopia's drive into Eritrea intensified today as dozens of tanks and thousands of troops streamed north to join a battle for control of the area around the strategic town of Barentu.</p>
        <p>For the two years of the war, the fighting has been confined largely to a sophisticated network of trenches along the nations' border. But five days after Ethiopia mounted an offensive, the trenches are empty and the war has shifted firmly into Eritrean territory. Barentu is about 40 miles from the Ethiopian border, and about 18 miles from this market village to the south.</p>
        <p>This afternoon Ethiopian jets streaked toward Barentu, and smoke from the area could be seen from here. Ethiopia said its army was four miles south of the town -- one of two major supply routes to the westernmost front of the war -- and advancing in heavy fighting.</p>
        <p>Eritrean officials said their soldiers had repulsed several assaults on Barentu but said the Ethiopians' gains -- which have emptied several Eritrean towns in the path of advancing troops -- confirmed the worst: Eritrea, until 1993 the northernmost province of Ethiopia, has always maintained that Ethiopia had its eye on permanently taking territory.</p>
        <p>The war started in May 1998 as a dispute over contested spots along the nations' 620-mile border. ''Ethiopia says it wants to regain contested territory, but then why do they keep trying to gain territory beyond the contested territory according to the colonial maps?'' Yemane Ghebremeskel, an aide to Eritrea's president, said to the French news agency today in the capital, Asmara.</p>
        <p>But Haile Kiros, an Ethiopian government spokesman, said the nation's interest was purely in retaking land that it said Eritrea invaded in 1998. ''Our intention is only to regain our territory,'' he said. ''The invading forces have to be pushed out.''</p>
        <p>After nearly a year of calm along the border, Ethiopia started an offensive on Friday, saying it wanted a quick end to a war that has drained its economy and complicated a food shortage that has affected millions of people. While Eritrea has condemned Ethiopia for reigniting the fighting and for reluctance in signing a peace accord, Ethiopia has said Eritrea was the original aggressor and needed to be punished.</p>
        <p>In the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa, government officials said its soldiers had shot down an Eritrean MIG fighter jet after it had bombed recaptured territory on Tuesday.</p>
        <p>[Late Wednesday night, after several hours of debate, the United Nations Security Council unanimously approved an arms embargo against Ethiopia and Eritrea, the Associated Press reported. The embargo will be terminated if Secretary General Kofi Annan reports that the conflict has been settled peacefully. Otherwise, the council is to review the situation in 12 months and decide whether the embargo should be extended.]</p>
        <p>Ethiopian troops poured through this town on the way north to Barentu. As they did, dozens of other Ethiopian troops looted the town, whose residents fled during the fighting on Saturday. Ethiopian soldiers picked through the mud-and-thatch houses and emptied shops in the main square. One soldier carried an umbrella and a soccer ball; another carried two new axes and a bottle of vegetable oil. Abdu Seid, a 22-year-old company commander, said that despite appearances, no one was really looting. The soldiers were dirty after all the fighting, he said, and looking for things they could bathe with.</p>
        <p>''We need to wash ourselves,'' he said. ''People have taken only what they need,'' he said.</p>
