        <p>Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday as the full scope of the Federal Reserve's half-point interest rate increase and hawkish statement on inflation risks began to sink in for many investors.</p>
        <p>The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 11/32, to 100 31/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, increased to 6.18 percent from 6.10 percent on Tuesday. The price of the 10-year Treasury note fell 15/32, to 100 4/32. Its yield rose to 6.48 percent from 6.42 percent the day before.</p>

        <p>Prices of Treasury securities fell yesterday as the full scope of the Federal Reserve's half-point interest rate increase and hawkish statement on inflation risks began to sink in for many investors.</p>
        <p>The price of the 30-year Treasury bond fell 11/32, to 100 31/32. The bond's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, increased to 6.18 percent from 6.10 percent on Tuesday. The price of the 10-year Treasury note fell 15/32, to 100 4/32. Its yield rose to 6.48 percent from 6.42 percent the day before.</p>
        <p>Earlier in the trading session, the expected announcement of a government buyback of up to $2 billion in old bonds today, failed to lift the prices of securities as investors fixated on a tighter credit environment and the prospect of higher rates to come. The Federal Open Market Committee's raising of short-term rates had been fully anticipated by the financial markets, despite the benign Consumer Price Index report for April.</p>
        <p>''Indeed,'' said Donald J. Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Asset Management, ''torrid economic growth in the midst of an incredibly tight labor market provides the ideal breeding ground for a pickup in inflation, and with evidence of rising prices and wages beginning to mount, the Fed clearly felt that a stepped-up pre-emptive strike was necessary.''</p>
        <p>Noting that the risks are still weighted toward heightened inflation pressures in the near future, Mr. Fine said that the Fed stated in stronger-than-usual fashion that increases in demand had continued to be in excess of even the rapid pace of productivity-driven gains in potential supply, thereby exerting continued pressure on resources. The concern is, he said, that this disparity will continue, which could foster inflationary imbalances that would undermine the economy's performance.</p>
        <p>Sherry Cooper, chief economist at Nesbitt Burns, said that ''Fed uncertainty over how soon consumer spending might slow might cause the Fed to return to smaller rate hikes at the remaining F.O.M.C. meetings this summer -- June 28 and Aug. 22.''</p>
        <p>''This will, of course, depend on incoming data,'' Ms. Cooper said, adding that the following meeting on Oct. 3 will be seen as too close to the election to interfere in the marketplace. The Fed will make an effort to get all of the rate increases out of the way before then, she said.</p>
        <p>The Treasury announced yesterday that it was selling $10 billion of two-year notes next Wednesday to pay down $15.94 billion on the federal debt. In when-issued trading ahead of auction, the note was being offered at a price to yield 6.87 percent.</p>
