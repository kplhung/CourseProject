        <p>A Manhattan jury failed to reach a verdict yesterday after a third day of deliberations in the trial of a mother and son accused of killing a missing Upper East Side socialite.</p>
        <p>But the judge in the case released a series of previously undisclosed accusations of wrongdoing against the woman, Sante Kimes, including charges that she fired a gun at one of her former husbands and failed to pay the pediatrician who delivered her son.</p>
        <p>Prosecutors made the accusations  at a May 4 hearing to determine which incidents Mrs. Kimes could be asked about if she took the stand in her own defense.</p>
        <p>Justice Rena K. Uviller of State Supreme Court closed the hearing to the public and the jury to prevent jurors from hearing the charges, but  agreed to release transcripts yesterday because the jury has been sequestered. Jose Muniz, a lawyer for Mrs. Kimes, denied the accusations.</p>
        <p>Elmer Holmgren, a man who told police he committed arson with the Kimeses, vanished in 1991 after telling friends he was going on vacation with them, prosecutors disclosed in the hearing. Robert McCarren said Mr. Kimes threatened him with a gun and Mrs. Kimes threatened to cut his tongue out if he revealed they were eavesdropping from and stealing from a woman from whom they rented a room in Bel Air, Calif., in 1998.</p>
        <p>According to the transcripts, prosecutors said that while involved in a custody dispute in 1969, Mrs. Kimes fired a gun at her husband, Edward Walker. Mr. Walker told prosecutors  he believed Mrs. Kimes fired blanks at him. Mr. Walker also said Mrs. Kimes forged court papers to give herself visitation rights to their son.</p>
        <p>When Mrs. Kimes gave birth to Kenneth, the son now standing trial with her, in March 1975, she charged to her bill a nightgown and other items from the hospital gift shop, prosecutors said. But she ''left the hospital abruptly and without paying either the hospital bills, the doctor bills or the bills in the gift shop.''</p>
        <p>The Kimeses are on trial for murder, accused of killing Irene Silverman in an attempt to seize control of her $8 million Upper East Side town house. Mrs. Silverman was last seen on July 5, 1998.</p>
