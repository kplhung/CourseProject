        <p>Next week's Congressional vote on whether to expand trade and economic ties with China has high stakes for Beijing and the Clinton administration, but it is also a test of the political clout of the technology industry.</p>
        <p>For the first time, technology companies are playing a leading role in Washington lobbying over a geopolitical issue. For several months, executives from Silicon Valley and other technology centers have been roaming the halls of Congress, lobbying for what they say will be billions of dollars of expanded exports to China as well as new jobs for Americans.</p>
        <p>Whether to grant China permanent normal trade relations is going to be ''the most important vote of this decade,'' said David McCurdy, a former Democratic member of Congress who is the president of Electronic Industries Alliance, a trade association. ''The industry will support people who support high tech.''</p>
        <p>Nearly a dozen chief executives made the rounds again today. And a few companies have gone a step further, running radio and television advertisements and conducting grass-roots campaigns to nudge thousands of their employees to write letters and send electronic messages to lawmakers.</p>
        <p>Although they are relative novices in the political arena, technology concerns are using big business and organized labor as models for how to press undecided members of Congress on the China bill. Their involvement is in contrast to the detachment they showed three years ago, when Congress decided not to give President Clinton authority to negotiate trade deals that Congress can accept or reject, but not amend.</p>
        <p>Previously, high-tech companies lobbied most visibly on narrower issues, including Internet privacy, data scrambling and immigration.  Microsoft has become a player in Washington's arena of money and politics, in part to protect its interests in the antitrust battle.</p>
        <p>In the past, few high-tech companies had large lobbying presences in Washington. This time around, the industry has unleashed scores of lobbyists and has banded together in powerful coalitions.</p>
        <p>At the same time, their trade associations are using the kind of hardball tactics, including advertising, that have served other industries  well in other lobbying wars, working with the United States Chamber of Commerce, the agriculture sector and companies like Boeing, all experienced in past fights involving trade with China.</p>
        <p>Frank Coleman, a spokesman for the Chamber of Commerce, welcomed the help from high-tech companies. ''They've thrown themselves into this battle in a strong and aggressive way, and I think they are picking up the game very quickly,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Robert A. Kapp, president of the U.S.-China Business Council, an umbrella group of 300 diverse companies, said the China issue had led to ''a massive energizing of the technology field.'' Their effort, he said, has been especially helpful in the campaign to sway Democrats, whose party has close ties to organized labor.</p>
        <p>These new lobbyists have been effective, lawmakers and others say. By emphasizing the power of the Internet, lobbyists have been selling a message that goes beyond their bottom line, stressing that the products they would export would spread democracy in China.</p>
        <p>And unlike organized labor and big corporations, technology companies have no firm loyalties and are considered up for grabs by both parties. Their popularity has translated into easy access in Congress.</p>
        <p>Still, the lobbying of high-tech executives pales next to organized labor's whirlwind approach and its grass-roots army. And the companies lag behind their more experienced big business allies.</p>
        <p>''They are catching up,'' said Representative David Dreier, a California Republican and a technology booster. ''But anyone juxtaposed to the organization that labor has put together, it's tough.''</p>
        <p>Intel Corporation has sent its chairman, Andy Grove, and Craig R. Barrett, chief executive, to the lobbying in Congress. The company has also run radio and newspaper ads and set up a grass-roots campaign through the company Web site. Within 48 hours, 5,000 of its employees sent letters to their lawmakers.</p>
        <p>Motorola has also plunged money into the battle, running television advertisements.</p>
        <p>Representative Rush D.Holt, a Democrat, has a host of high-tech companies in his district in central New Jersey, and has been courted by the industry, in part because he is a scientist. He spent one evening taking a technology tour of a New Jersey plant, where he met with executives from Sony, Intel and Hewlett-Packard.</p>
        <p>Mr. Holt, who is facing a tough re-election battle, remains unconvinced that more trade with China is the cure-all that proponents make it out to be. ''It's as if trade is the most important thing,'' he said. ''And I don't think Americans necessarily think so.''</p>
