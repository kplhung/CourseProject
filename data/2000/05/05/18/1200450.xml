        <p>PAT RILEY walked into his team's locker room yesterday morning and talked the brave Game 5 talk, as only he could.</p>
        <p>''I love these games,'' he announced to his team, sounding like Robert Duvall smelling napalm in the morning.</p>
        <p>The war to defend home court was a go. Game 5 simply had to be won. The Heat was on for the coach's alter ego, his beleaguered boss, Riley the organization almighty.</p>
        <p>It was time, once and for all, for Alonzo Mourning to justify the Heat president Riley's anointing of him as a franchise player. Time for Dan Majerle and Tim Hardaway to show they had something left in their once golden strokes. Time for Anthony Carter and Bruce Bowen to say thank you, Riles, for this ticket to the big time. They all owed him and they all saved him from having to go back to New York tomorrow night to face humiliation and elimination on the Madison Square Garden floor.</p>
        <p>''We made shots,'' Riley said with the coolness of a coach who had diagrammed them all, after the Heat held serve, won Game 5 by 87-81 here last night.</p>
        <p>Majerle made two late fourth-quarter 3-pointers, one from so far out it looked as if it had an American Airlines boarding pass. The well-traveled Bowen stuck a three-ball from the left corner with 35 seconds left and the Knicks down three. Hardaway dragged his painful foot through a 10-point, 2-assist bonus of a third quarter and the rookie Carter made more improbable plays. Jamal Mashburn continued his breakout spring and Mourning, well, the defensive player of the year managed to not foul out until less than a minute remained with the Heat at least in position to win.</p>
        <p>Now the Knicks are one defeat away from losing it all to Riley's roster of has-beens and wannabes, to a team 99 percent of New York was so sure was not good enough.</p>
        <p>Rhetorical bromides aside, more playoff series are won on the telephone lines than the front lines. While no one ever doubted Riley's ability to motivate his team to play and play hard, we waited for evidence last night that a Miami group shaped in the image of his blue-collar core could stare down its former reflection, reshaped and upgraded, and not blink.</p>
        <p>''We have got to get over the hurdle and if it's New York, it's New York,'' Riley said. ''We have a good team. We have built a good team.''</p>
        <p>He, more than anyone, realized the time had come for his team to prove it by holding serve at home, or shut up for good. Riley had already tried talking and taunting his team past the Knicks. He betrayed his friendship with Jeff Van Gundy for a desperate plea two years ago. He's railed against Mourning's fraternizing with Ewing. He had to apologize Tuesday for his bad joke about sending the Gestapo after relocated Knicks fans.</p>
        <p>''It's been four years of hard work, so there's nothing that I can say,'' he finally admitted. ''The players have to perform.''</p>
        <p>And these are the players he assembled, after leaving New York to run his own show, the fashion step for the power coach. From that particular species, we have already seen the crashes on different levels this year of Jimmy Johnson, of Rick Pitino, of Bill Parcells. Say this for Phil Jackson: he resented coexisting in Chicago with Jerry Krause, but he didn't let front-office control stand in the way of his chance to coach Kobe and Shaq.</p>
        <p>The one-man operation has not exactly produced electrifying results. Coaching is like deadline writing, the emotions running too high and the perspective too narrow to make the appropriate revisions. So while Riley the coach has worked wonders in Miami, Riley the personnel maven has left questions that still must be answered, in all likelihood, right back here Sunday in Game 7.</p>
        <p>''I think there could be something to that,'' Riley said recently, when asked if he, as president, may have undermined himself as coach. ''But we tried to acquire Mitch Richmond. We tried to acquire Latrell Sprewell. We stepped up to the plate and were told no, no, no, no.''</p>
        <p>For those scoring at home, it still takes four ''no's'' for elimination from this round. The Knicks are in trouble, as deep as it gets in a seven-game series. They were outrebounded again last night by 10. Allan Houston was locked up again by Majerle. With all that, they have lost three games by a combined 11 points. Bill Russell's blessing aside, Mourning still can't get through a hot playoff night without punishing himself with silly fouls. The Heat survived last night, answered the questions, but just for Game 5.</p>
        <p>Riley the coach smelled blood. Riley the recruiter was relieved.</p>
