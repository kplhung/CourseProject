        <p>Sporting less muscle and hardly any beads, Venus Williams returned to the scene of one of her most important victories today and made it clear that, despite her father Richard's suggestions to the contrary, she always intended to return to the game.</p>
        <p>''No, no,'' she said about retirement. ''I would have been back a lot sooner if it wasn't for the tendinitis in my wrists. It just took a long time to heal. I used to have tendinitis in my knee. I could play with that. It was different. But you can't do it without your hands.''</p>

        <p>Sporting less muscle and hardly any beads, Venus Williams returned to the scene of one of her most important victories today and made it clear that, despite her father Richard's suggestions to the contrary, she always intended to return to the game.</p>
        <p>''No, no,'' she said about retirement. ''I would have been back a lot sooner if it wasn't for the tendinitis in my wrists. It just took a long time to heal. I used to have tendinitis in my knee. I could play with that. It was different. But you can't do it without your hands.''</p>
        <p>Citing sore wrists, Williams missed the first four months of this season, withdrawing from five tournaments, including the year's first Grand Slam event, the Australian Open. During her layoff, she said she followed the game on television and the Internet and took a course in fashion illustration.</p>
        <p>''I like playing tennis more,'' she said. ''Studying is a real job.''</p>
        <p>She returned to competition two weeks ago in Hamburg, Germany, beating Irina Spirlea in three often unsightly sets and then losing in straight sets to Amanda Coetzer, a player she once dominated consistently. But today, on the same court where she won the last Italian Open title, she bore a closer resemblance to the power player her opponents remember.</p>
        <p>Against Coetzer in Hamburg, she had made unforced errors in bunches and often looked off balance. In today's 6-1, 6-2 victory over Chanda Rubin, she covered court very well, kept her aggressive groundstrokes more consistently in play and finished off the inconsistent Rubin with her fifth ace of the match, five more than she hit against Coetzer.</p>
        <p>''I'm really starting to play better now,'' said Williams, who spent the last nine days training in Rome. ''Starting last week in Hamburg, I was a little iffy. It was just tough. I was not practicing very much, and I just had to learn a tough lesson.''</p>
        <p>This has been the most trying period yet in the 19-year-old Williams's short but compelling career. In an interview after the match, conducted with her tiny Yorkshire terrier Pete sitting comfortably on her lap, Williams said she had first felt a twinge in her left wrist here while warming up on center court for a match in Rome last year.</p>
        <p>''I didn't pay much attention to it,'' she said. ''You use your whole body. Sometimes you feel different things, but they go away. But I can tell you that I sure didn't know it was going to come out like this.''</p>
        <p>Williams, a right-hander with a two-handed backhand, taped her wrist for matches occasionally throughout the summer: reaching the quarterfinals at Wimbledon and the semifinals at the United States Open, where her younger sister, Serena, won the singles title.</p>
        <p>''The wrist just got steadily worse over the season,'' said their mother and co-coach, Oracene. ''Venus was playing hurt and not telling anyone.''</p>
        <p>But Venus said that it was only after reaching the Chase semifinals that the pain became too intense for her to practice or play.</p>
        <p>''In December, I was home really training and trying hard to get ready for the Australian Open, and I just couldn't do it,'' she said. ''Between January and April, I would say I had a total of maybe three weeks of practice at the most.</p>
        <p>''I could have gone to tournaments, but I just don't know how good it would have been to take the risk of losing matches because I was a little bit injured or having to retire from matches. I just thought it would be wiser to stay home until it was healed.''</p>
        <p>Venus, whose two-handed backhand is her best shot, even experimented with switching to a one-handed backhand in an attempt to accelerate her comeback.</p>
        <p>''She was hitting one-handed with slice,'' Oracene said. ''And we just told her, 'Venus that's not your game.' ''</p>
        <p>''All it did was end up hurting my right wrist,'' Williams said. ''But I'm better now.''</p>
        <p>Venus said she tried a variety of treatments, including acupuncture, but the only remedy that really helped was time.</p>
        <p>''I missed tennis, but I had a lot to do,'' she said. ''Every day was packed, and it was like I was the one at home, so I did everything. I became the businesswomen. I did things for Serena, things for my mom, things for my dad, things for myself. Everyone's affairs, I handled.''</p>
        <p>In March during the Ericsson Open, her father said that he believed it was very likely that Venus would retire.</p>
        <p>''Venus was shocked when she heard it,'' Oracene said of her husband's comments.</p>
        <p>''So what can I say?'' Venus said today. ''I was just an innocent bystander. I was just watching the story, too.''</p>
        <p>Though Venus declared herself ''pain free,'' she played today with her left wrist taped, which she had not done in Hamburg.</p>
        <p>''It's fine,'' she said. ''I'm feeling real good. If it wasn't good, I would just be shipped home. It's not holding me back from my regular shots.''</p>
        <p>For the moment, she is not hitting her first serve as consistently hard as before her layoff. She has clearly lost muscle definition, if not weight, in her legs and arms.</p>
        <p>''My dad, he wanted me to do a lot of fitness work,'' she said, ''but I usually found a way to get out of it.''</p>
        <p>Asked whether she might not feel she had maximized her talent until she, too, had won a Grand Slam singles title, she said: ''There's no one out here who doesn't want to win a Slam. I know I have the capability. We'll see if I can.''</p>
        <p>Barring a relapse, she will get her next opportunity at the French Open, which begins on May 29. Serena, who has struggled with her game of late, is currently in Florida because of a sore knee and is spending her time moving into her and Venus's recently completed new home.</p>
        <p>But Oracene and Venus both expect Serena to play at Roland Garros. The other contenders are well aware that, unlike most of them, the sisters do not necessarily need many matches to reach cruising speed.</p>
