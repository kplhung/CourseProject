      <abstract>
        <p>Op-Ed article by Jim Lichtman says Bobby Knight, basketball coach at Indiana University, has been given another chance, despite his history of tirades, threats and intimidation; says apologies are not enough if they are not followed by sincere attempts to change, and there has been no indication that Knight will get professional counseling he needs; says making such an allowance for him lowers bar for everyone else</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>Along with many others, I was appalled to read that Indiana University had retained its basketball coach, Bobby Knight, despite Mr. Knight's verbal attacks against players, officials, journalists and office staff, and his grabbing a player's throat at a 1997 practice. Myles Brand, the university president, said: ''I think the ethical approach is to give him one last chance.''</p>
        <p>This kind of thinking is all too common in business as well as sports. What it says is: In spite of the offense, if you apologize and act penitent enough, we will tolerate, allow, make exception. We'll give you a pass because you're talented and we want -- we need -- that talent. Talent is the overriding factor because of what it contributes to big sales and winning teams.</p>

        <p>This kind of thinking is all too common in business as well as sports. What it says is: In spite of the offense, if you apologize and act penitent enough, we will tolerate, allow, make exception. We'll give you a pass because you're talented and we want -- we need -- that talent. Talent is the overriding factor because of what it contributes to big sales and winning teams.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, when you make this kind of allowance, you lower the bar for everyone else. You also put the entire organization at risk, jeopardizing the trust of others you work with and rely on, and sending a message about how far you are willing to go to win.</p>
        <p>''I had never seen him before contrite and apologetic,'' Mr. Brand said of Mr. Knight. But apologies aren't enough if they are not followed by sincere actions to change. When asked whether Mr. Knight needed  professional counseling, Mr. Brand said, ''He has given me his word that he will take extraordinary steps to change his behavior.'' Given Mr. Knight's ''extraordinary'' history, do we really believe this will happen?</p>
        <p>Ethics requires more than a good-faith statement. John Wooden, the legendary U.C.L.A. basketball coach, a gentleman on and off the court, wrote to me last year: ''In 1934  I coined my own definition for  success, which I tried to personally attain and get all my students  to attain. It is 'peace of mind which  is a direct result of self-satisfaction in knowing you did your best to become the best of which you are capable.' ''</p>
        <p>It's hard to imagine Indiana players achieving such peace of mind by means of tirades, threats and intimidation. In giving ''one last chance,'' a university may have saved its coach but lost the game.</p>
