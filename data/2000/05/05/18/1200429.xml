        <p>AL LEITER felt homesick Sunday night. Missed his wife, missed his daughters, missed his 1-month-old son, so he jumped on the last flight to Fort Lauderdale.</p>
        <p>It's nice to be a major league ballplayer who essentially does not have to worry about the staggering inequities of last-minute airline fares. Blessed with unimagined income, Leiter is also setting a high standard for athletes with his hands-on involvement in charity work, while trying to keep a perspective at home. He arrived in time for a major milepost in the life of his 5-year-old daughter, Lindsay, who had lost her first tooth.</p>
        <p>''I got to be the Tooth Fairy,'' Leiter reported. ''I was stunned to learn that the going rate is $5 these days. We persuaded her this is only for the first one, then it goes down.''</p>
        <p>Good luck with that theory. With three young children, Leiter figures to be working out a reasonable scale for Tooth Fairy activities, but he has vowed that he will be there for much of it. A 34-year-old left-hander, Leiter has a perfect 5-0 won-lost record for the Mets after pitching eight inning in last night's 4-2 victory over Colorado. He is coping with pitching in New York while his family is living in Florida for much of the year, but he does not want this to go on forever.</p>
        <p>''I've got two years left on my contract after this year,'' Leiter said the other day. ''I still love the competition, and this is not about money, but I'm not going to miss the early years of my kids' lives. I'm just not going to do it.''</p>
        <p>He is tired of getting messages on his answering machine up North from his daughters, saying they miss him.</p>
        <p>''I see guys playing as long as they can, while their kids are teenagers,'' he said. ''I want my kids to know me.''</p>
        <p>Not only his own children will feel the impact of Al Leiter, however. He and his wife, Lori, are actively working to help other children through the Leiters Landing Foundation, which they began in 1996, when he pitched for the Marlins.</p>
        <p>The most noticeable figures are the $1 million they pledged over his four-year contract beginning in 1998, and the 2,500 children who have watched Mets games, but Leiter is not a passive spectator of the charity, like many public figures who write a check. He is an activist.</p>
        <p>''We ask organizations to write grant proposals and we look them over,'' Leiter said. ''It is such a good feeling when you do it yourself. It seems things run much more smoothly. We had one employee, but we found we could do it ourselves, with my wife and a friend of ours, Val Chevalier, taking care of the smallest details.''</p>
        <p>Leiter recently organized and financed a project at City Meals on Wheels that got 15 high school students doing volunteer work delivering meals to homebound elderly people. There is a mentoring program in Harlem, a ball field in New Jersey, a computer project in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>He uses his celebrity status to bring in other benefactors, including Knight Securities, Ultimate Software, Twin Labs, Coverall America and Park Avenue Country Club.</p>
        <p>His efforts have not gone unnoticed. Recently the Dime Savings Bank of New York organized a program called Hometown Heroes, giving six grants of $50,000 each to be donated in the name of six New York athletes personally involved in community work -- Adam Graves of the Rangers, Marcus Camby of the Knicks, Kenny Jonsson of the Islanders, Michael Strahan of the Giants, Jayson Williams of the Nets and Leiter.</p>
        <p>''This is fun,'' Leiter said. ''We can have tremendous impact. Charles Barkley said we are not role models, that parents and other adults are role models, and I understand what he means, but I would tell Charles: 'You know, people are looking at you. While you're here, do something. When we're back home, people are not going to care about us. We're going to be regular people again.' ''</p>
        <p>Leiter looks forward to being a regular person. ''It was so great being home,'' he said. ''My 3-year-old was afraid of the Tooth Fairy, so she had to sleep in our room. My 5-year-old was so excited with the money. We went out on a date Monday; she bought headbands with the money.''</p>
        <p>He knows full well that regular people don't excite corporations, don't attract galleries at charity golf events, don't make public-service announcements. Al Leiter is doing all that, rather than merely brood over his homesickness, which can only occasionally be alleviated by a quick dash to the departure gate.</p>
