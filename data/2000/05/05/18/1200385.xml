        <p>Confirming a longstanding trend in crime and society, a new Justice Department study released yesterday shows a sharp drop in domestic murders, particularly the killings of black men by their black women partners, which fell 74 percent over the last two decades.</p>
        <p>But the report also underscored how the face of domestic violence in America has changed. Even as the number of black victims has fallen, the number of white women killed by their husbands and boyfriends in fact rose slightly, to 876 in 1998 from 849 in 1976.</p>
        <p>The report itself did not address the reasons for this discrepancy and many experts expressed puzzlement over it. But some criminologists and women's advocates said the explanation may be that black women traditionally were much more likely to be victims of domestic homicide than white women, so that the legal, social and economic changes of recent years have helped black women more than white women. Paradoxically, white women pushed most visibly for tougher laws against domestic violence and for shelters for abused women.</p>
        <p>Despite the decline, black women in 1998 were still victims of domestic killings at a rate of 4.5 per 100,000, compared with 1.75 per 100,000 for white women, said James Alan Fox, the Lipman professor of criminal justice at Northeastern University.</p>
        <p>In addition, said Elizabeth M. Schneider, a professor at Brooklyn Law School, because men often tend to kill their partners when their wife or girlfriend is leaving the relationship, ''to the degree that white women have more acts of separation or independence, this may trigger more partner violence among white men.''</p>
        <p>But Professor Schneider said, ''I am still surprised that the decrease in black women as victims of partner homicides is so big,'' since black women have been more reluctant than their white counterparts to use the new laws against domestic violence and have their partners arrested. Professor Schneider wrote a book on the subject, ''Battered Women and Feminist Lawmaking,'' to be published this fall by Yale University Press.</p>
        <p>Another factor, several criminologists said, is that black men have been disproportionately jailed and imprisoned, taking them out of their homes, therefore making it less likely that they will either kill their partners or be killed in domestic quarrels.</p>
        <p>Over all, the new report found, the number of people killed by their intimate partners declined to 1,830 in 1998 from about 3,000 in 1976.</p>
        <p>The biggest beneficiary of the decrease was black men, with the number of black men killed by intimate partners falling 74 percent in the last two decades. The number of black women killed by their partners dropped 45 percent in the same period and the number of white men killed by their partners declined 44 percent. The number of white women killed by their partners rose 3 percent.</p>
        <p>The number of white women killed by their partners actually declined from 1993 to 1997, but rose again in 1998 to help account for the long term 3 percent increase, said Professor Fox. Whether the 1998 figure was an anomaly or the start of an upward trend is unclear, he said.</p>
        <p>The increase in white women killed by their partners was largely among women living with boyfriends rather than husbands, Professor Fox said. Because more couples are living together rather than getting married, he said, this increase could continue.</p>
        <p>Beyond killings, the report found, the number of women who were victims of nonlethal domestic violence dropped by 21 percent from 1993 to 1998, to 876,340 women victims from 1.1 million.</p>
        <p>The report was published by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, the statistical branch of the Justice Department.</p>
        <p>Richard Rosenfeld, a professor of criminology at the University of Missouri at St. Louis, said there were several factors behind the decline in domestic homicide. One is changes in living arrangements, with fewer people getting and staying married, or even living together for long periods of time, which means less opportunity for killing.</p>
        <p>A second factor, Professor Rosenfeld said, is the panoply of changes to help battered women, including new restraining laws, quicker arrests of batterers, shelters and support groups. Laura Dugan, an assistant professor of criminal justice at Georgia State University, said she had found in a large-scale study that as cities created more legal advocacy services against domestic violence, fewer men were being killed by their wives, though the same did not hold true for women.</p>
        <p>''Basically, we think that legal advocacy gives women access to the criminal justice system, so women in abusive relationships have an out, and can get protection and don't need to kill to get out of a relationship,'' Professor Dugan said. But men, she said, tend to kill in a fit of rage or jealousy, so the new legal services for women are not as successful in preventing men from killing their partners.</p>
        <p>Alfred Blumstein, a professor of criminology at Carnegie Mellon University, put it another way: ''When men kill their partners, it is probably an unintended escalation of a quarrel. But when a woman kills her partner, it is more likely she sees it as a last resort to an unacceptable situation.''</p>
        <p>A third factor widely cited by experts has been the improved economic status of women, especially black women, who have more college education than black men and can find better jobs now, so they can be more independent and get out of dangerous relationships.</p>
        <p>Still another factor, Professor Rosenfeld said, is the enormous incarceration rate of black men -- four times higher than it was in 1976.</p>
        <p>The sum of these legal, social and economic changes have been so powerful that they have reversed the pre-1976 pattern in which black women actually killed their male partners more often than black men killed their wives or girlfriends, Professor Dugan said.</p>
        <p>But Sue Osthoff, the director of the National Clearinghouse for the Defense of Battered Women in Philadelphia, said she was concerned that the very progress society has made in giving women more resources to leave bad relationships ''may have inadvertently put women at greater risk.'' This might explain why the rate of white women being killed by their partners has not dropped, she suggested.</p>
        <p>''People don't understand what battering is really about,'' Ms. Osthoff said. ''It is about controlling somebody. So when a woman leaves, that is a threat to the man, and some men say, 'If I can't have her, nobody will.' That makes leaving the most dangerous time.''</p>
