        <p>THERE'S a new kid in town, and he's not like the macho, muscle-bound heros brandishing brazen attitudes and big guns in games like Quake III and Unreal Tournament. His name is Bob, and he's the cute little cherub starring in  Messiah, a new 3-D action game from Interplay.</p>
        <p>The world that Bob is sent from heaven to save is a distressed one. The apocalypse has come, and those who have survived it are none too happy or friendly. Outfitted only in diapers and a cuddly layer of baby fat, Bob explores a realm that includes gorgeously rendered burned-out alleys, Byzantine factories and processing plants where the main ingredient is all too human.</p>

        <p>THERE'S a new kid in town, and he's not like the macho, muscle-bound heros brandishing brazen attitudes and big guns in games like Quake III and Unreal Tournament. His name is Bob, and he's the cute little cherub starring in  Messiah, a new 3-D action game from Interplay.</p>
        <p>The world that Bob is sent from heaven to save is a distressed one. The apocalypse has come, and those who have survived it are none too happy or friendly. Outfitted only in diapers and a cuddly layer of baby fat, Bob explores a realm that includes gorgeously rendered burned-out alleys, Byzantine factories and processing plants where the main ingredient is all too human.</p>
        <p>Despite appearances, Bob is one of the mightiest heroes to hit the gaming scene in a long time. His secret weapon is possession: he can take over anyone's body, usually the bodies of those who can get him access to the next level of the game through a special key, a code or sheer firepower.</p>
        <p>The choice of hosts is crucial. Guards, for instance, can open only some doors, while lab technicians have special skills needed to operate certain machinery. Maintenance workers -- by far the funniest of the bunch, they wear baggy jeans and utter niceties like ''Hey, little fella'' and ''Well, I'll be'' -- wield blowtorches, used for repairing faulty elevators.</p>
        <p>The game player has a third-person point of view, following the actions of Bob as if floating over his shoulder (or over the shoulder of whatever body he inhabits). Getting Bob into the body of any of the characters takes stealth and good aim. In most cases, Bob's best tactic is to sneak up behind the soon-to-be host, then make a flying leap to land square between the shoulder blades.</p>
        <p>If successful, Bob's possession of the host will take place without anyone's noticing. That may seem more than a little fishy since the excruciatingly all-consuming act occurs with a startling flash of pyrotechnics and gasping sounds that go a long way to indicate the unpleasant role the host must now play. It's hard to believe that anyone nearby wouldn't run in horror. Still, in this game's weird science, stealth begets a kind of invisibility and the safety it offers.</p>
        <p>A translucent halo floats above the host's head -- handy in heated firepower situations when it is sometimes hard to tell just which soldier you're playing. Once the shooting starts, both fellow soldiers and the rebels they're fighting, whose allegiance you'll switch to and possess in the dank underbellies of the havoc-racked futurescape, will turn on you and blast away, once they see Bob pop out of a deceased body. Bob must then quickly fly into another, playing this form of human-host pinball as many times as necessary until the last man or woman standing is the one you will continue with. For a while, anyway.</p>
        <p>That's because Bob will sometimes have no more use for his host and will need to escape it so he can run around barefoot or duck under stuck doorways. Or, more enthralling, he may rise to a higher place by using his angelic wings, which he beats with a whoosh-whoosh sound and which grow more powerful as the game progresses.</p>
        <p>But depossession has its nasty side effects. A few moments after Bob springs from the host's head with fireworks, the soldiers, and at times even the gentler inhabitants, will attack Bob. Sometimes the attacks are with firepower or fists, and sometimes they come with swift kicks punctuated by curses and taunts like ''take that'' or ''little punk.''</p>
        <p>One strategy for depossession involves having Bob stand his host in a corner and then abandon the body, sneaking to safety before the host has time to turn around and spot him. An even better tactic is to abandon the body with a swan dive off a high ledge. That lets Bob flap backward to safety while the useless host falls to its death with a bone-smashing thud.</p>
        <p>With all its profanity and often graphic violence, Messiah isn't for the faint-hearted. The explicit religious references (Bob is supposed to be acting on the orders of God to restore order to the world) might also offend some players. Bob's selection of unseemly hosts even lands him in a lustful red-light district known as Sex City. Once there, he will get into the tormented hearts, burned-out minds and scantily clad bodies of prostitutes, a transvestite and eventually a particularly unhygienic pimp.</p>
        <p>Think ''Bladerunner'' meets ''Dogma'' and you will begin to understand the feeling Messiah is trying to evoke. Players who stay in the game through the first few levels discover that the voice that is bellowing orders at Bob with a rising tone of menace belongs not to God but to an imposter. Hint: Hell won't be freezing over anytime soon as long as it's under this bad guy's watch. And it's up to Bob to stop the masquerader in an extremely challenging, mischievous,  apocalyptic showdown ending that comes far too soon.</p>
        <p>In its short in-store life, Messiah has had a history of technical problems, including lockups and quirks and incompatibilities with certain video and sound cards.</p>
        <p>Players and would-be players passionately vent these gripes and others in newsgroups and on the official Messiah Web page. My version didn't play any of the accompanying music tracks by the rock band Fear Factory, which Interplay made a big deal of promoting during the game's much-delayed development, which took more than two years. Other than that, Messiah played fine on my computer, running under Windows 2000 Professional no less, which isn't exactly touted as being game-friendly.</p>
        <p>By the time the company posted the latest patch to correct many of the game's errors, I had already reached the open-ended ending, which finds Bob tired, alone, wandering and wondering where everyone has gone. He calls out: ''Hello? Dad? I'm ready to come to heaven.'' It's a poignant moment.</p>
        <p>Conflicts aside, Bob is an engaging character, vulnerable and sympathetic. He even elicits a weird sort of affection as he draws out his finger and utters an earnest ''bang'' to desperate effect, finishing with a little blow on his finger as though it were a smoking gun, his lower lip pushed out in defiance as his attackers swarm and ultimately overtake him. Thank goodness the Save Game feature lets you back up to your last safe point to try another tactic.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, Messiah transcends much of the usual senseless carnage that describes most first-person shooter games. For gaming mortals equipped with fast computers and 3-D video cards capable of running the game with no hang-ups, Bob's role in taking on the presumed Almighty is mighty entertaining. But for those unlucky souls whose systems can't accommodate Messiah, heaven will have to wait.</p>
        <p>Messiah, from Interplay; recommended for Windows 95 and 98; $45; ages 17 and older.</p>
