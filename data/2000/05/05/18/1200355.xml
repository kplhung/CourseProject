        <p>Over the last six years Brazil has reduced state ownership of telecommunications, power and mining companies in what is widely regarded as a highly successful privatization. But the government is facing unexpectedly tough domestic resistance to selling one of the biggest state assets, a bank known as Banespa.</p>
        <p>With two months remaining until a scheduled auction of Banespa, a Sao Paulo court has prohibited potential buyers from looking at the financial records in Banespa's data room, acting on a lawsuit from unionized bank employees.</p>
        <p>Hundreds of financial analysts representing potential buyers have been encamped in Sao Paulo hotels, hoping the order, the latest in a series of delays, will be reversed. Even if it is, more court-ordered delays are expected in the sale of a prize with 600 branches, 3 million customers and 6 percent of the nation's bank deposits.</p>
        <p>''I've stopped predicting the frequency of the delays,'' said Brent Erensel, director of Latin bank equity research at Deutsche Bank. ''From the time when the data room opens, the soonest we can expect an auction is 10 weeks later. Until the room opens, you cannot start the clock ticking.''</p>
        <p>The battle over the potential sale of Banespa, formally known as Banco do Estado de Sao Paulo illustrates an underlying ambivalence in Brazil about the benefits of privatization, which began in 1994. The change has created an investment boom in Brazil and many foreign companies now do business here. But the job security of many Brazilians has been threatened as their employers changed from the government to private owners who want to cut costs.</p>
        <p>Opponents of the Banespa privatization say more than job security is at stake. The Sao Paulo Bank Employees Union, which is leading the fight, argues that Banespa is an important driver of growth in the state of Sao Paulo, providing credit to small farms and businesses and investing in social and educational projects. Union officials say Banespa's priorities could change completely under new ownership.</p>
        <p>''The government came out with a study recently that said that infant mortality in the State of Sao Paulo has tripled,'' said Joao dOliveira, the union director. ''Why is that? Lack of basic sanitation. And who invests in those projects? Banespa does.''</p>
        <p>Most experts agree, though, that Banespa's sale is inevitable. ''The sale could maybe drag out another two months, but to reverse the privatization process is practically impossible,'' Eduardo Guimaraes, the president of Banespa, said in an interview today. ''Once the data room opens, it will be even more complicated.''</p>
        <p>Seeking to rebut critics, the government has warned that any further delay in the sale of Banespa could bring grave economic consequences to a country still recovering from the currency crisis of early 1999.</p>
        <p>Since the government plans to use the proceeds of the sale, estimated to be as much as $2.3 billion, to pay down public debt, the Central Bank estimates that a six-month delay would cause the government to lose more than $100 million in interest payments. Many economists say the government is exaggerating the economic dangers. Mr. dOliveira, at the union, agrees. ''Their claim of grave economic consequences is totally ridiculous,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Banespa's sale would be an important political achievement for President Fernando Henrique Cardoso. Banespa represents the last of what critics call the bad old days, when government-run banks were used to finance questionable government projects.</p>
        <p>''The sale of Banespa is a benchmark in terms of the fiscal reforms that the government has been undertaking over the last few years,'' said Andre Loes, chief economist at Santander Investment in Sao Paulo. ''If the bank isn't sold this year, the government will lose much more in political terms than in revenue.''</p>
        <p>Nine banks have expressed interest in buying Banespa, including Brazil's three largest private banks -- Bradesco, Itau and Unibanco. The others include Banco Safra of Brazil, as well as Citibank, a unit of Citigroup; BankBoston; HSBC, and BSCH of Britain and Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria of Spain.</p>
