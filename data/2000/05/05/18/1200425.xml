        <p>In the elevator at Sotheby's after last night's sale of contemporary art, two collectors were bemoaning all the things they didn't buy last year. While prices just six months ago may have seemed too expensive, compared to last night's prices they were a veritable bargain.</p>
        <p>Bidding on contemporary art of all periods, tastes and styles was fast and furious, often exceeding the heady prices of the 1980's art boom. The sale totaled $46 million, above its high estimate of $41 million. Of the 70 works offered, only 3 failed to sell.</p>
        <p>How long until the bubble bursts?</p>
        <p>''We keep asking ourselves that,'' said Diane Upright, a former head of contemporary art at Christie's who is now a private dealer in Manhattan. ''This sale showed both sides of the contemporary-art market: it's not just young blood going after young art, but what Alan Greenspan calls irrational exuberance.''</p>
        <p>The sale set records for 17 artists, including modern masters like Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still and Bruce Nauman.</p>
        <p>By far the star of the evening, however, was Rothko's ''Yellow Over Purple'' (1956), one of the artist's abstract canvases. It was being sold from the Morton G. Neumann Family Collection, having been on exhibition at the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1980 and 1981. Sotheby's had offered the Neumann family a guarantee, an undisclosed minimum price that an auction house promises the seller regardless of the sale's outcome. After three telephone bidders vied for it, the painting finally sold to an unidentified collector for $14.3 million, sailing above its high estimate of $9 million.</p>
        <p>The sale featured eight Warhols. of which three were in the top 10 selling works last night. Two of the eight were being sold by S. I. Newhouse Jr., the publishing magnate.</p>
        <p>Among the best was Mr. Newhouse's ''Natalie Wood,'' a 1963 overlapping grid of images of the movie star. Three bidders tried for it, and the painting finally sold to unidentified German bidder standing in the very back of the salesroom for $2.7 million, nearly twice its high estimate of $1.5 million. A Warhol watercolor also being sold by Mr. Newhouse, ''One Dollar'' (1961), also nearly doubled its high estimate, selling to an unidentified telephone bidder for $489,750.</p>
        <p>Far more expensive were ''Mona Lisa-Four Times,'' a 1978 silkscreen that brought $830,750, just over its high estimate of $800,000, and one of the artist's classic ''Flowers'' silkscreens. This one, from 1964, was being sold by United States Senator Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey. It went to an unidentified telephone bidder, also for $830,750, far above its high estimate of $600,000.</p>
        <p>(Final prices include Sotheby's commission: 20 percent of the first $15,000, 15 percent of the next $85,000, and 10 percent of any amount over $100,000. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)</p>
        <p>Fashionable artists like the 1980's art star Jeff Koons were also represented last night. Mr. Koons's ''Yorkshire Terriers,'' a 1991 wood sculpture of a pair of wide-eyed Yorkies, one with a pink bow, the other with a blue bow, was expected to sell for $120,000 to $180,000; an unidentified bidder bought it for $258,750. But the other work by Mr. Koons offered last night did not fare so well. ''Wall Relief With Bird'' (1991), a sculpture of candy-colored flowers from the artist's ''Made in Heaven'' series, was expected to fetch $500,000 to $700,000; Anthony d'Offay, the London dealer, bought it last night for $610,750. On Tuesday night at Christie's sale of contemporary art, some works by Mr. Koons scored big prices: ''Woman in Tub,'' a 1988 sculpture of a woman grabbing her breasts, sold for $1.7 million.</p>
        <p>Unlike Christie's, whose sale of contemporary art includes only works made in the last 30 years, Sotheby's dates contemporary art from 1945 to the present. As a result, last night's sale had many classic images like David Hockney's ''Day Pool With Three Blues (Paper Pool 7),'' from 1978, one of the artist's famous pool series. This one has bright blues with a yellow diving board. Estimated at $500,000 to $600,000, it finally brought $665,750, a record for a work on paper by Mr. Hockney, after three people fought for it..</p>
        <p>The sale included a group of works described only as coming from a private European collection. Dating from 1965 to 1971, they ranged from Minimalist sculpture and painting to Conceptual photography and neon installations. The seller is Angelo Baldassarre, who, like many other Europeans who bought art in the mid-1960's and early '70's, had a taste for radical American art.</p>
        <p>Among his prized works up for sale last night was was Brice Marden's ''Rain Forest,'' a three-panel abstract work from 1971 with lush gray-green tones reminiscent of a tropical landscape, estimated at $1.5 million to $2 million. Robert Mnuchin, chairman of the Manhattan gallery, C&amp;M Arts, bought it for $1.5 million. Also from the collection was Mr. Nauman's ''Light Trap for Henry Moore, No. 1'' (1967). a black-and-white photograph made by twirling a flashlight in a darkened room and recorded in the glowing spirals. Five people wanted the work, which was estimated at $250,000 to $350,000 and  finally sold to an unidentified bidder for $533,750.</p>
        <p>Abstract Expressionist works did well last night. Clyfford Still's 1947 ''Untitled,'' a brown-and-red composition made a record price. A protracted three-way bidding war ensued. The painting finally sold to an unidentified telephone bidder for $1.7 million, more than twice its high estimate of $700,000.</p>
        <p>After the sale. everyone was amazed at the results but also tried to rationalize the high prices. Tobias Meyer, head of Sotheby's contemporary art department worldwide and the evening's auctioneer, described today's market as ''that glorious combination: a scarcity of material and the great accumulation of wealth in the last two years.''</p>
