        <p>The Serbian government seized control of the main opposition television station today, accusing it of advocating an uprising.</p>
        <p>Taken by surprise, opposition politicians talked of the beginning of outright dictatorship in Serbia under President Slobodan Milosevic and called an immediate protest rally.</p>
        <p>Tonight, even though opposition media could not broadcast word of the rally, some 20,000 demonstrators took to the streets. The police were out in large numbers, and there were a few clashes with supporters of the Red Star soccer team who were returning from a match.</p>
        <p>Some protesters broke windows and upset or burned garbage containers. Others taunted Mr. Milosevic, who has been indicted on war crimes charges by the international tribunal in The Hague, chanting: ''Slobodan, save Serbia, kill yourself,'' and a new admonition: ''To The Hague, to The Hague, Slobodan to The Hague.'' The charges stem from the war last year in Kosovo.</p>
        <p>The seized television station, Studio B, belonged to the city of Belgrade. It also provided a frequency for the independent radio station B2-92, which was effectively silenced.</p>
        <p>Studio B was controlled by the Serbian Renewal Movement of Vuk Draskovic, the governing party in the city and the single largest opposition party in the country. Lavish in its coverage of Mr. Draskovic, Studio B has been the most important opposition television outlet in Serbia, able to reach up to half the population in normal times, and its seizure is an attack on Mr. Draskovic.</p>
        <p>Local and federal elections are due by year's end in Yugoslavia, which comprises Serbia and the much smaller republic of Montenegro.</p>
        <p>Since December of last year, Studio B's broadcasts have frequently been jammed, and it has been one of the main targets of an increasing series of fines and lawsuits aimed at the independent media and independent publishing houses.</p>
        <p>Leaders of the political opposition did not speak at tonight's rally, and Mr. Draskovic was said to be in Montenegro, apparently for his safety. The rally heard B2-92 journalists reading the news and a few speeches, with the promise that such rallies would continue on Thursday.</p>
        <p>The opposition parties did issue a joint statement, saying: ''The regime has taken the country into a state of emergency. Let us stand against this violence with all our energy, because the future of our country is at stake.''</p>
        <p>Radio Pancevo, the independent station that broadcast to Belgrade throughout the war, continued to operate in the nearby town of Pancevo, but its frequency in Belgrade was jammed with other programming, making it impossible for the capital to get independent broadcast news.</p>
        <p>Studio B remained on the air today, showing pro-government material and the official news. Music was broadcast on Radio B2-92's frequency.</p>
        <p>The new management of Studio B broadcast pictures of the empty newsroom, highlighting cabinets full of expensive foreign liquor, a British flag and signs from the United Nations and the NATO-led peacekeeping force in Bosnia, underlining official accusations that the opposition works for the NATO countries that bombed Yugoslavia last year.</p>
        <p>The official charge against the station, in an order signed by the radical nationalist leader Vojislav Seselj, who is Serbia's deputy prime minister, was that Studio B had called for a violent overthrow of the constitutional order and had incited people to riot. For that, the government said, it seized control and ownership of the station.</p>
        <p>''This is the beginning of dictatorship,'' said Ognjen Pribicevic, a top aide to Mr. Draskovic. ''Now it's up to the people of Serbia, to see how many show up to defend Studio B. The next step could be a ban on political parties.''</p>
        <p>Another opposition leader, Vladan Batic, said: ''The government has imposed an informal state of emergency. This indicates an introduction of a civil war.''</p>
        <p>Another such politician, Zarko Korac, said: ''The Serbian regime has opted for an open dictatorship.''</p>
        <p>The director and editor in chief of Studio B, Dragan Kojadinovic, denied that the station had called for an uprising.</p>
        <p>The head of the Association of Independent Electronic Media, Veran Matic, said that the closing of B2-92 was ''collateral damage'' and that it was looking for backup broadcasting options. He said the closings were ''the most serious assault'' yet on independent media.</p>
        <p>Mr. Draskovic and other members of the opposition have sometimes been intemperate in their language and have come close to calling for a popular movement to sweep Mr. Milosevic out of power without benefit of elections. They have also called on the army and the police to defect to the opposition and overthrow the president.</p>
        <p>Last Friday, at a party rally in Ravna Gora, Mr. Draskovic said his party would more strongly oppose ''the terror'' of Mr. Milosevic's government. ''From today, we will not only defend ourselves by meetings, speeches and statements, but by all means possible,'' he said. And when his supporters shot guns into the air, Mr. Draskovic said: ''Save your ammunition. You'll need it.'' The rally was shown on Studio B.</p>
        <p>Studio B also regularly aired Mr. Draskovic's charges that senior government police and political officials conspired to kill him in a car accident last October in which his brother-in-law and some bodyguards died.</p>
        <p>Mr. Milosevic has typically been careful to keep to the letter of the law, but he and his government now are acting more arbitrarily than before. Since the war over Kosovo and his indictment on war crimes charges, Mr. Milosevic's motivation to please the West by allowing a zone of free speech has considerably diminished.</p>
        <p>The police moved at 2 a.m. to seize the building holding the offices and newsroom of Studio B. The police also locked the offices of B2-92 and Radio Indeks, in the same building, as well as the offices of the largest independent newspaper, Blic.</p>
        <p>Blic, which has a circulation of more than 220,000, was already a government target, with the state-owned Borba printing press refusing to print the paper, supposedly on the ground that a press was broken.</p>
        <p>Blic, which has been able to print only about half of its normal press run at two other printing houses, presumably will continue to appear, since it has no connection to Studio B. This evening, Blic managed to come out with a special four-page edition.</p>
        <p>But the private printing house that prints other independent publications is under attack by the government for alleged financial irregularities. The printing house, ABC Grafika, has been ordered to vacate its premises, though it has appealed.</p>
        <p>In recent days, especially after the murders last week of some senior officials, including Bosko Perosevic, a senior member of Mr. Milosevic's party, the Yugoslav authorities have increased their attacks on members of the opposition, labeling them traitors, terrorists and fascists.</p>
        <p>The opposition, often divided, has lately shown signs of more unity. But after a successful rally in Belgrade last month, when more than 150,000 people gathered, a second rally on Monday attracted fewer than 20,000. Government officials gloated, and they may have taken the low turnout as a signal to press their challenge to the opposition.</p>
        <p>The government also increased its attacks on the student organization Otpor, whose name means Resistance, which has attracted more serious political support in recent months. In the last week, at least one journalist was accused of espionage but was later released.</p>
        <p>And some 40 Otpor activists and other opposition figures have been detained in recent days for ''informative talks'' with the police.</p>
