        <p>A diet low in salt and high in fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy products can lower blood pressure as much as medication can, researchers reported yesterday, confirming earlier work showing that diet can help to treat high blood pressure.</p>
        <p>The researchers urged that people with hypertension adopt the diet, and, in a more controversial recommendation, said that healthy people should follow it, too, to prevent hypertension. The diet lowered blood pressure in both groups, though the benefit was greater in those with high blood pressure, who achieved reductions averaging 11.5/5.7 millimeters of mercury. This is about the same reduction that hypertension drugs provide, the researchers said.</p>
        <p>Nearly 50 million Americans have high blood pressure, defined as readings consistently higher than 140/90 millimeters of mercury, or 130/85 in diabetics. Readings below 120/80 are considered optimal, and those between 120/80 and 140/90 are called ''high normal.'' Untreated, the condition increases the risk of stroke, heart attack and kidney failure.</p>
        <p>Despite the availability of drugs to lower blood pressure, hypertension is often ignored or poorly controlled.</p>
        <p>The diet in the new study contained less than half as much salt as most Americans eat. Subjects had all their meals prepared by dietitians. The researchers said they did not know whether most people, cooking for themselves and eating in restaurants, would be able to stick to such a diet. The scientists called on the food industry to lower the amount of salt in processed foods to make it easier for people to comply.</p>
        <p>Previous calls to limit salt in healthy people have provoked heated debate, with some scientists arguing that the resulting blood pressure reductions, if any, were too small to be worth the trouble.</p>
        <p>But the authors of the new study said their findings proved that restricting salt was beneficial. The scientists, led by Dr. Frank Sacks of the Harvard Medical School, announced their findings yesterday in New York at a meeting of the American Society of Hypertension.</p>
        <p>The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, which supported the $11.8 million study, issued a statement from its director, Dr. Claude Lenfant, saying that the study had proved once and for all that reducing salt in the diet helps everyone, even people who do not have hypertension.</p>
        <p>''The finding suggests than an intake below that now recommended could help many Americans prevent the blood pressure rises that now occur with advancing age,'' Dr. Lenfant said.</p>
        <p>The new study, called DASH-Sodium, for Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension, included 412 people age 22 and older. About 57 percent were women, and 57 percent were black; blacks have a higher risk of hypertension than whites.</p>
        <p>About 41 percent had hypertension, and the rest were ''high-normal,'' above 120/80.</p>
        <p>They ate either their normal diet, but with varying amounts of salt, or a DASH diet, also with varying amounts of salt and including five cups of fruits and vegetables and three cups of low-fat dairy products per day. The sodium levels from the salt were 1.5 grams, 2.4 grams or 3.3 grams a day. Most Americans eat 3.5 grams a day, the amount in about 1.5 teaspoons of table salt.</p>
        <p>The DASH diet alone and sodium restriction alone both lowered blood pressure, but the greatest reduction came when the DASH diet was combined with the lowest level of sodium.</p>
