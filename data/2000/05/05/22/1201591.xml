        <p>Down a little alley off Second Avenue at East Second Street, behind two wrought iron gates, easily missed by most strollers, lies a patch of pastoral New York, a secret garden where 2,060 people have been laid to rest for eternity (or, for some, until a choicer piece of real estate opened up).</p>
        <p>This month, for the first time since 1909, the owners of the New York Marble Cemetery, the oldest nonsectarian cemetery in Manhattan, met to discuss its future.</p>
        <p>So what type of person owns part of a cemetery in Manhattan? The descendants of the original vault owners -- by now their great-great-great-grandchildren -- who share a love of genealogy, and who laugh when they hear the one about an ancestor who died at a public event when the platform he was standing on collapsed under him. (He was hanged.)</p>
        <p>They all shook their heads and frowned a bit as they inspected the cemetery's shaky, tumbledown walls, which were reduced in some spots to rubble or held in place by towering steel braces. And they wondered aloud how to restore the names and dates on the wall plaques that show who owns which vault beneath the lawn, names that have slowly been erased by time.</p>
        <p>It rests with the descendants to figure out how to preserve what is left. The north wall, near what was for years the city's main shelter for homeless men, is in ruins. Utility workers have tacked cables and wires to the tops of the fragile wall caps and have draped them across the lawn, leaving litter behind. Trails made by alley cats crisscross the grass.</p>
        <p>At a meeting of the cemetery owners on May 3 at the Bouwerie Lane Theater, Peter Luquer, an architect in Vermont who has served as one of the group's trustees for 23 years, said that a full restoration would most likely cost $1 million to $1.5 million. The owners are already committed to about $300,000 in work on the walls, work that is now under way.</p>
        <p>Anne Brown, another trustee, who lives in Maryland, takes the work, and the cemetery's history, seriously. She has even memorized most of the original owners' names.</p>
        <p>''Oh, you're a Riggs?'' she asked a man looking for an ancestor at the cemetery. ''You're Hosiah? No, Elisha. He's in number 35. ''You can't fool me.'' She then confessed to a fear that she was ''losing it,'' perhaps. ''I am beginning to feel I know these people,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The cemetery's true grandeur is underground. Beneath the half-acre lawn, each of the 156 vaults is made of the Tuckahoe marble, like that used at the United States Capitol and St. Patrick's Cathedral.</p>
        <p>The cemetery was founded in 1830, after outbreaks of yellow fever led residents to fear burying their dead in coffins just a few feet below ground. Wary of the miasma that was thought to be emitted by corpses, the city outlawed traditional burials, first below Canal Street, then below 14th, then 86th. In this marble cemetery and, later, in the New York City Marble Cemetery, a block away on Second Street, bodies were placed in dry underground stone vaults that were believed to reduce the risk of contagion.</p>
        <p>In the 1840's, many families chose to bury their dead in more rural and fashionable graveyards like Greenwood Cemetery in Brooklyn, and many bodies originally buried at the New York Marble Cemetery were moved. The last burial in the Marble Cemetery took place in 1937, although current owners can choose to be buried in the vaults.</p>
        <p>Those resting in the vaults were not the highest of high society. The wealthiest New Yorkers had country estates where they could be laid to rest. The Marble Cemeterians were more likely to be merchants, ship owners or lawyers, though there are Beekmans, Hoyts, Motts and Varicks, names familiar from the city's maps. One can also find Auchinclosses and Scribners. Several of the cemetery's biggest names, including President James Monroe, were buried there temporarily.</p>
        <p>But some of the cemetery's less renowned residents claim the most interesting stories. In Vault 54, for instance, there's Mary Ann Delafield DuBois, who set up the Nursery &amp; Child's Hospital, later part of New York Hospital. Mrs. DuBois was almost mute, and communicated by singing and sign language.</p>
        <p>Then there was the stray Southern sympathizer, George Douglass, in Vault 120, who, around the time of the Civil War, swore he would not cut his beard again until Maryland's states' rights were restored. He died unshaven in 1869.</p>
        <p>And lest we forget, there is Obadiah Holmes, who married three VanWyck sisters -- Sarah in 1812, Joanna in 1826 and Jane in 1830. The first two wives died before the cemetery was built, and he moved them into Vault 115 together, apparently in the same coffin.</p>
        <p>The list of owners and residents is sort of a R.I.P.ley's Believe It or Not for old New York. The marble cemetery has housed Theodore Gordon, a man known as the father of American fly fishing, Benjamin Wright, the father of American civil engineering, and Aaron Clark, the only Whig mayor of New York.</p>
        <p>In her assiduous research into the cemetery's history, Mrs. Brown has gone so far as to descend into one of the vaults, to determine if it was built to specifications.</p>
        <p>''For 30 seconds,'' she recalled, until another person joined her, ''I was the only person alive who had ever been in these vaults,'' aside from cemetery workers. The doors swung easily on their hinges, with only a small pile of dust in their way. Inside her family's vault, she saw small rolls of what looked like barbed wire, which puzzled her, until she realized they were the frames of long-gone funeral wreaths.</p>
        <p>''If you sneezed, they would all go to nothingness,'' she said.</p>
        <p>The tombs themselves, in contrast, were glorious in their permanence.</p>
        <p>''The vaults are 100 percent marble, rough-hewn, with specks of glittery stuff,'' she said. ''It was like going into an igloo.''</p>
        <p>She videotaped her descent, and shared the views with a newly elected trustee, Kinny Post, of Woodstock, N.Y., whose family, including the man he was named after, Waldron Kintzing Post, owned three vaults.</p>
        <p>''You could see skulls, and see bones, but even some of those had deteriorated,'' he said of the video. Mrs. Brown found some pewter hardware from the coffins, and even panes of glass, from when coffins had windows for viewing the dead.</p>
        <p>Over all, it was surprising how empty the vaults appeared. ''The manager of the funeral home figured that since we're all biodegradable, you could bring someone in every 10 years forever,'' she said, referring to a nearby funeral Home, which keeps a key to the cemetery. ''It only takes 50 years for a body to break down.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Brown contacted many other descendants of owners through the Internet, and, in Mr. Post's case, through the social register. The research is complicated by one of those fascinating facts of genealogy: only about 3 percent of an ancestor's great-great-great-grandchildren will share the ancestor's last name.</p>
        <p>Many of those at the meeting had learned of the group through a Web site, www.marblecemetery.org, which lists most of the people buried there. (People without Web access who want more information about the cemetery and its original owners may write Mrs. Brown at 10375 Mackall Road, St. Leonard, Md., 20685-2490.)</p>
        <p>During the meeting, she asked for as much genealogical information as possible, to help in her search for other owners.</p>
        <p>''If you know that Great Aunt Ethel married someone named McGillicuddy, that helps,'' she said at the meeting. ''As for Kinny Post, the only way I could have been able to find him was to know he was Waldron Kintzing Post, so I knew he was a good one.''</p>
        <p>Ownership of each vault is passed down through the generations. With the discovery of every new owner comes hope that another person will fall under the cemetery's spell. The group plans to raise money by making a plea to descendants of the original owners, by using its local and national landmark status to obtain private grants, and by seeking corporate donations.</p>
        <p>Referring to the utilities that have laid cables on the property, Mr. Luquer, the trustee, said, ''There are a couple of companies we feel have been using the property for their benefit, and we would like to approach them and see if they would be able to help us out.'' There is also talk of opening the cemetery more often for visitors, and of charging a  small admission fee.</p>
        <p>The cemetery could certainly attract those who love New York history. The grounds are surrounded by some of the great, varied landmarks of the East Village. The cemetery lies across the Bowery from the Bouwerie Lane Theater, west of the Provenzano-Lanza Funeral Home, a block or so away from the music club CBGB, near the Anthology Film Archive, the Church of the Nativity, which Dorothy Day attended, and the Amato Opera Theater, and south of the Hell's Angels headquarters. The city's last Orthodox shroud factory was a few doors away, on Second Street.</p>
        <p>Mr. Luquer is glad to see the end of what he called the Dark Ages of the cemetery, when few people cared about it. At the turn of the 19th century, the owners had considered shutting it down and moving the bodies elsewhere, with plans to build a school there, and until just recently, neighbors held barbecues there.</p>
        <p>''It was a very, very dicey part of the city to be in, but now I think there's considerable interest,'' Mr. Luquer said. ''I think it's mounting, growing, and I'm very pleased.''</p>
        <p>He attributes much of this new energy to Mrs. Brown, whom he calls the cemetery's saint. ''She came to us at the right time, having written this seething letter, about how could it be the way it is, so derelict,'' he said at the meeting. ''I lay awake one night, trying to see if we could capture that energy and put it to use. I wrote a sweet letter to Anne to see if she would join me'' in running the cemetery. She has since written both a history of the cemetery and a large check for its restoration.</p>
        <p>To Mr. Luquer, the logistics of keeping up the hidden cemetery are worth it.</p>
        <p>''Here is this quiet little haven in the middle of such a dynamic piece of real estate such as downtown Manhattan,'' he said. ''It really is sort of a treasure there, and it's so unique that it gives you kind of a thrill to be a part of it.''</p>
