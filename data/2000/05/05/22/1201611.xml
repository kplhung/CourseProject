        <p>As the number of asthma cases in the United States rises sharply and researchers scramble to find the cause, newly released data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that most states have no system to track the number of people with asthma or monitor what happens to them, and only a few states have any recent reports on the illness in their jurisdictions.</p>
        <p>The data was reported in a study by Health Track, a new public health group based at Georgetown University in Washington and financed by the Pew Charitable Trusts. The study, to be made public today, says 27 states have no asthma monitoring program, 30 states have no up-to-date information on asthma within their borders, and more than 40 states have no ''ready access'' to information on how many people get emergency care or whether patients have access to good treatment.</p>
        <p>The recent rise in the number of asthma cases is a mystery. It appears to be occurring in many spots around the world, and while the number of cases had been rising slowly over many decades the figures have shot up dramatically since about 1980, said Dr. Lynn Goldman, a pediatrician with the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health.</p>
        <p>''The explosive growth has come recently, and it is very unusual,'' Dr. Goldman said. ''There are not many things in medicine that rise suddenly like that.'' The increase -- from 75 percent to 160 percent in different age groups, with the biggest jump among children -- has occurred in less than 20 years.</p>
        <p>Asthma is now the most common chronic disease among children, the most common medical reason for school absence and the most frequent cause of trips to hospital emergency rooms, according to statistics from the National Institutes of Health. The last statistic is important, doctors say, because treating asthma in the emergency room is an expensive and inefficient approach that health insurers would like to reduce.</p>
        <p>Various studies have shown that certain factors -- including the presence of cockroaches, higher levels of ozone and diesel pollution, and increased smoking among young women -- are associated with asthma, but it is uncertain why. Dust mites, viral infections and breast-feeding have also been linked to the disease.</p>
        <p>But in looking for the cause of the epidemic, said James O'Hara, executive director of Health Track, ''We have blindfolded ourselves, because most states don't have access to one of the least expensive and most effective tools for preventing the spread of the disease: information.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Goldman said additional information was essential. ''To prevent and treat the disease, we have to know where to look and what to look for,'' she said.</p>
        <p>For example, knowing in what parts of the country and among what groups the disease is hitting hardest can help public health officials target prevention and treatment programs. More important in the long run is the way information on an epidemic can be used to spot its cause.</p>
        <p>Researchers have estimated that a national tracking and monitoring program for asthma would cost about $25 million annually, Mr. O'Hara said. He said the cost of asthma to the national economy was about $14.5 billion a year and rising.</p>
        <p>The Centers for Disease Control began to watch the rise in cases a few years ago, and in 1998 noted that the increase had reached epidemic proportions. The agency began to survey states, cities and territories about their ability to monitor the epidemic, and finished analyzing the survey results this year.</p>
        <p>Health Track, which specializes in environmental issues, combined the data with reports from the National Institutes of Health and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists to produce the current report.</p>
