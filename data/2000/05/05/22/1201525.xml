        <p>This is the age of 24-hour sports television networks, sports talk radio stations, countless sports Web sites,  the continued dominance of Sports Illustrated and the immediate availability of game scores on wireless devices (and so on).

        <p>This is the age of 24-hour sports television networks, sports talk radio stations, countless sports Web sites,  the continued dominance of Sports Illustrated and the immediate availability of game scores on wireless devices (and so on). So do sports fans, particularly in the New York area, need more sports coverage?</p>
        <p>The New York Post thinks so. Beginning June 1, it will publish a separate weekly newspaper covering local teams.</p>
        <p>The editors of the tabloid think a good portion of its readers just cannot get enough of its particular brand of sports coverage and will be willing to spend an extra $1.50 a week for the new publication, to be called New York Post Sports Week.</p>
        <p>The plan is in keeping with the strategy of Rupert Murdoch, the chairman of The Post's parent company, the News Corporation, to capitalize on avid sports fans' passions for their favorite teams and players. His television sports network, Fox Sports Net, for instance, creates regional programming for fans in 19 different markets nationwide.</p>
        <p>Ken Chandler, The Post's publisher and editor in chief, said his editors came up with the idea for the paper and saw it as a good chance to extend The Post's brand. In a similar vein, earlier this year the newspaper began a separate Web site for its gossip column, Page Six (Pagesix.com).</p>
        <p>This will not be a major rollout. The initial print run will be 75,000 to 100,000, a fraction compared with the circulation of The Post (436,544 daily; 358,545 on Sundays). The publication, which will carry 48 to 52 pages at first, will be supported by newsstand sales, with some advertising.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Chandler said the news articles would be original, not recycled. Six new reporters will write exclusively for the weekly newspaper, but the entire sports staff will contribute to it in return for more money, including The Post's columnists, like Steve Serby, Phil Mushnick and Peter Vecsey.</p>
        <p>While The Post follows the sports news of the day, Mr. Chandler said Sports Week would be filled with long features, investigations and deeper statistics. It will feature color on its cover and on some inside pages.</p>
        <p>Can it work?</p>
        <p>''Between The Sporting News, Sports Illustrated and the Internet, the dailies, it's kind of interesting that they think there's an opportunity there,'' said Jared Weiss, a partner at Steiner Sports Marketing. ''I don't see it from the surface.'' Nevertheless he said he is discussing promotions with the newspaper.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chandler was confident.</p>
        <p>''It's based on the assumption that our readers love our sports coverage and no matter how much we give them in the paper, they always seem to want more,'' he said.</p>
