        <p>The players dispersed after a tense timeout, but a frantic Coach Jeff Van Gundy was still standing on the court, cupping his hands and directing the Knicks until the official Dick Bavetta raked him back on the sideline.</p>
        <p>There were just 12.4 seconds on the clock, and all his team needed was one last defensive stop to leave the Miami Heat in pieces once again. Van Gundy wanted the choreography to be perfect. As the next 10.3 seconds unfolded inside the queasy air of American Airlines Arena, he watched as the ball zipped to Alonzo Mourning. On cue, Patrick Ewing and Larry Johnson sealed the Heat's star off like gates at a railroad crossing.</p>
        <p>They did not want Mourning to end their season. Anyone but him. The ball was swung to an open but timid Jamal Mashburn, who ditched it to the reserve Clarence Weatherspoon. The last shot of Game 7 was his. As his jumper fell horribly off the rim, Latrell Sprewell embraced the ricochet while his feet danced dangerously near the baseline and Dan Majerle tugged at his shorts. The clock stopped at 2.1 seconds remaining.</p>
        <p>Just why did it stop? For an instant, the official Bennett Salvatore ruled Sprewell had tiptoed out of bounds and awarded the ball back to the Heat. Then, a conference took place, Bavetta overruled Salvatore, and the ball went back to the Knicks as another tortured grimace registered on Heat Coach Pat Riley's face.</p>
        <p>An instant later, Charlie Ward inbounded the ball to Chris Childs. Then Childs, the confident bit player who surfaced as the Knicks' stars vanished today, flung the ball into the rafters before the Heat could foul him. Before the ball landed, the Knicks were swinging their fists into the air knowing Game 7 was theirs, 83-82.</p>
        <p>For the third time in four years, the Knicks eliminated the Heat on Miami's floor. This time, they took the Heat in a second-round series, four games to three, to advance to the National Basketball Association's Eastern Conference finals against the Indiana Pacers. Game 1 will be in Indianapolis on Tuesday night.</p>
        <p>''I don't think you're surprised by how a game goes,'' Van Gundy said. ''It came down to a last possession and Sprewell's rebound. We feel very proud of our accomplishment.''</p>
        <p>The Heat players felt wronged. As cups and plastic noisemakers pelted the court, Tim Hardaway barked at the officiating crew, while Mashburn was in the ear of Bavetta as security people led the referees away.</p>
        <p>''That's why they call him Knick Bavetta,'' Hardaway said. ''It's not right.''</p>
        <p>In a finish that was true to the lore of this rivalry, the ending was wild, unpredictable and bizarre. Even Salvatore's explanation was odd.</p>
        <p>''I have Sprewell calling timeout, but I wasn't sure where his foot was,'' he said. ''I didn't believe he was out of bounds but I wanted to check with my partner that he was not out of bounds when my whistle blew. He confirmed that and there was no question that the timeout came before he went out of bounds.''</p>
        <p>Except for one thing. Sprewell said he did not call a timeout and did not signal for one either. Was it a phantom voice? If so, it will go on the list of moments to haunt the Heat through another off-season filled with demons. And yet, a somber Riley did not use the officials as an excuse. ''We should have won in spite of it,'' Riley said. ''This is a very difficult one to take; we were at home. It's a hard way to lose.''</p>
        <p>In the end, the less talented Heat was not as mentally sturdy as the Knicks were. The Heat could not come up with an X-factor like Childs, who scored the Knicks' first 10 points of the fourth quarter to keep his team in the game. It could not find a way to get the ball to Mourning, who scored 29 points but could not get off a shot in the last three minutes of Game 7. It could not capitalize on its chances at the free-throw line, where the Heat missed 5 of 7 in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>As desperation experts, the Knicks found a way to hold it together. For the third game in this four-of-seven-game series, one of the Knicks' maligned point guards came through. It was Childs's turn as the Knicks' top scorers disappeared around him.</p>
        <p>A limping Allan Houston (2 for 10) had too sore a left ankle to separate himself from the barnacle on his side, Majerle, and was only a decoy on the floor. A hot Sprewell scored 20 in the first half but made just 1 of 8 shots in the second half against a variety of double teams.</p>
        <p>So who was left? Childs and Ewing, the same two teammates who had squabbled during Game 5, had to work as one down the stretch. First, Childs led the way, then Ewing caught on.</p>
        <p>''I just kept attacking,'' Childs said. ''I was just trying to make things happen.''</p>
        <p>He did just that near the nine-minute mark of the fourth quarter. With the Heat ahead, 71-68, Childs seized a hiccup in Anthony Carter's dribble, stripped the ball from him and then raced down the floor for a fast-break layup that drew a foul and created a 3-point play.</p>
        <p>Five minutes later, with the Heat lead back to 6 points, Childs penetrated and drew a foul. He hit both free throws.</p>
        <p>At this point, he had scored the Knicks' only 10 points of the fourth quarter. Help would come soon. Ewing began asserting himself. When Mourning darted toward Ewing for a steal, Ewing made a swift move that defied his Tin Man appearance. He sidestepped his Georgetown protege and soared in for a dunk with 1 minute 20 seconds left that gave the Knicks an 83-82 lead -- and made for the deciding points in the game.</p>
        <p>''We live to fight again,'' Ewing said after scoring 20 points and adding 10 rebounds. ''I feel for Miami. They came out with a lot of heart and intensity. One of us had to lose, and I'm just happy we were the ones to win it.''</p>
        <p>They did it with one final stop. They did not let Mourning beat them and watched as Weatherspoon's 12-footer missed. With 12.4 seconds left, that was all they needed to carry on in the playoffs and give themselves a shot at another appearance in the N.B.A. finals.</p>
        <p>''At that point in the game, it was all about getting the ball out of Mourning's hands,'' Van Gundy said. ''We were willing to live with any other shot.''</p>
        <p>The Heat has to live with another devastating outcome. If Riley follows through and dismantles a team that has failed to get past the Knicks for three straight years, the faces of this rivalry may never be the same again.</p>
        <p>''You have to wonder what will happen to them,'' said Marcus Camby, who helped give the Knicks a 46-43 rebounding edge with 12 boards. ''Riley might break it up. But as long as he is the coach here, it will always be an intense rivalry. This was something, wasn't it?''</p>
        <p>REBOUNDS</p>
        <p>The Heat set a playoff low with 562 points in a seven-game playoff series. . . . There were 65 lead changes and 48 ties in the seven games. . . . The game was played nearly flawlessly by both teams. The Heat had five turnovers while the Knicks had six. . . . The Knicks made 28 of 31 free throws. The Heat made 11 of 21.</p>
