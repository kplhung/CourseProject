      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial urges gun control advocates to channel energy of Million Mom March into sustained grass-roots political movement that can challenge power of National Rifle Assn; says movement needs to step up its own public education efforts, counteract NRA's lobbying, raise more money and build a professional staff</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The National Rifle Association's annual convention over the weekend in Charlotte, N.C., drew nowhere near the massive crowd that took part in last week's Million Mom March for more stringent gun control laws. But the N.R.A.'s power has never depended on rallying vast numbers of people or even favorable opinion polls.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the mothers' march itself was largely an expression of frustration over the N.R.A.'s ability to block gun control in Congress and the state legislatures even in the face of surveys showing that many more Americans endorse gun control than oppose it -- as well as the depressingly frequent outbreaks of gunfire in schools.</p>

        <p>The National Rifle Association's annual convention over the weekend in Charlotte, N.C., drew nowhere near the massive crowd that took part in last week's Million Mom March for more stringent gun control laws. But the N.R.A.'s power has never depended on rallying vast numbers of people or even favorable opinion polls.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the mothers' march itself was largely an expression of frustration over the N.R.A.'s ability to block gun control in Congress and the state legislatures even in the face of surveys showing that many more Americans endorse gun control than oppose it -- as well as the depressingly frequent outbreaks of gunfire in schools.</p>
        <p>Gun control leaders are now considering how best to channel the energy of the Mother's Day event into a sustained grass-roots political movement. Their first order of business is to focus on why their opponents are so successful.</p>
        <p>The N.R.A.'s dominance rests mainly on intensity and intimidation. It says it has 3.6 million dues-paying members, a figure seven times larger than the contributors list of the leading gun control advocacy group, Handgun Control Inc. More important is the N.R.A.'s relatively small core of superdedicated members, who can be relied upon to blanket Congress with letters, phone calls and e-mail on a moment's notice, making it appear that the pro-gun constituency is larger than it really is.</p>
        <p>To reinforce the pressure on Congress, the N.R.A. raises millions of dollars that it then spreads around as campaign contributions to its loyal supporters. It also has a long track record of punishing those who dare deviate from the N.R.A. line by making direct donations to their opponents, and by running ''issue ads'' attacking them -- sometimes disguising the N.R.A.'s sponsorship by raising an issue other than gun control.</p>
        <p>The N.R.A. also employs a large number of lobbyists who use their knowledge of how laws are written and their close ties to key legislators to water down popular gun control proposals when outright opposition would be politically impossible. Promoting weaker alternatives, and hiding behind calls for stricter enforcement of existing laws -- something everybody supports -- the N.R.A. has succeeded in tying up the modest gun control package that passed the Senate after the Columbine High School massacre last year.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for the gun control side, N.R.A. leaders have a tendency to say offensive things that undermine their organizational and monetary advantages. In March the group's executive vice president, Wayne LaPierre, suggested that President Clinton was ''willing to accept a certain level of killing to further his political agenda.'' The recent boast by the N.R.A.'s first vice president, Kayne Robinson, that the N.R.A. would have an office in George W. Bush's White House was not a whole lot smarter.</p>
        <p>The gun control movement needs to be ready to take advantage of these flubs -- much as Handgun Control recently did by running a television commercial publicizing Mr. Robinson's indiscreet bragging. But that is obviously not enough. For too long, the N.R.A. has gotten away with shoddy arguments unsupported by empirical evidence. For example, it has asserted that keeping a loaded handgun handy to use against a possible intruder makes homes safer when, in fact, the opposite is true.</p>
        <p>If it is to succeed, the gun control movement must be prepared to step up its own public education efforts and to counteract the N.R.A.'s lobbying efforts. That, in turn, means raising more money and building a professional staff. But mostly it means putting pressure on lawmakers using the movement's best asset -- the huge constituency of voters in districts all around the country, including a large number of suburban women, who are fed up with gridlock on gun control.</p>
