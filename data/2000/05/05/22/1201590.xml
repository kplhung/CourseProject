        <p>The early promise of thalidomide as an anti-cancer drug apparently is holding up, according to findings disclosed today at the meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology here.</p>
        <p>Thalidomide is the sedative that was banned worldwide after it maimed thousands of babies in the 1960's, mostly in Europe, Canada and Japan, when their mothers took it for morning sickness. Now thalidomide is being resurrected as part of the treatment for AIDS, leprosy and some types of cancer.</p>
        <p>Last year, Dr. Bart Barlogie, an oncologist at the University of Arkansas, reported that thalidomide could slow the course of multiple myeloma among people who had failed to respond to standard therapy. Multiple myeloma is a deadly cancer that damages the bone marrow and other organs.</p>
        <p>Today, Dr. Barlogie said at the  meeting that his team had confirmed and extended the findings that thalidomide was active and could be used safely with chemotherapy in a larger group of people with advanced multiple myeloma in the same study.</p>
        <p>Dr. Barlogie described the findings as ''stunning'' at the meeting, which has drawn more than 20,000 cancer specialists from more than 100 countries.</p>
        <p>Dr. Barlogie said thalidomide appeared to be the first new drug in three decades that had had a beneficial effect on multiple myeloma.</p>
        <p>The new findings involve 169 patients, nearly double the 89 cases that the Arkansas team reported on in the New England Journal of Medicine last year. All patients had received stem cell transplants; about half had failed to respond to other drugs.</p>
        <p>Response to thalidomide, however, often occurred rapidly in these patients. After 25 months of thalidomide and other chemotherapy, overall survival was 45 percent, and about 10 percent have not had a significant relapse, Dr. Barlogie said. He said he could not compare these figures with other treatments because a clinical trial of therapy in advanced multiple myeloma among patients who had had stem cell transplants had not been done. ''An educated guess'' is that most patients would have died in six months without thalidomide, Dr. Barlogie said.</p>
        <p>Other scientists have reported similar findings in studies involving about 800 patients with advanced multiple myeloma, Dr. Barlogie said.</p>
        <p>Because thalidomide ''is working impressively,'' Dr. Barlogie said his team has begun a new set of studies in the last of the standard three-stage system used to determine the effectiveness and safety of drugs. These studies, which are expected to involve about 500 patients, aim at determining two uses of thalidomide. One is whether thalidomide will be effective as part of the therapy in newly diagnosed cases of multiple myeloma. The other is whether thalidomide would be effective if used alone in multiple myeloma.</p>
        <p>Thalidomide's limited success poses a mystery: Why does it work?</p>
        <p>Although the drug is believed to block growth of blood vessels, this action does not appear to explain its effect in multiple myeloma.</p>
        <p>About 14,000 Americans develop multiple myeloma each year. The cancer can lead to bone pain, anemia and kidney failure. Because it also damages the immune system, it can lead to recurrent infections.</p>
        <p>Malignant myeloma cells produce a protein in the blood that is reduced  among patients responding to thalidomide therapy. Thalidomide also makes the bone marrow more normal. These findings raise the possibility that thalidomide has a potent effect on the immune system or may even kill myeloma cells directly.</p>
        <p>In 1998, the Food and Drug Administration approved thalidomide for the first time, for treatment of leprosy. The drug is marketed by the Celgene Corporation of Warren, N.J.</p>
        <p>In a different study discussed at the meeting today, Dr. Monica Morrow of Northwestern University in Chicago reported that survival rates among women with breast cancer varied with the number of women that hospitals treated each year.</p>
        <p>Survival rates were better among  patients at hospitals that cared for more than 25 cases a year, according to the study that Dr. Morrow led for the American College of Surgeons.</p>
        <p>In the study of 175,879 women treated at 1,404 hospitals, across the country, 509, or 39 percent, of the hospitals treated fewer than 25 breast cancer patients a year. Survival rates at hospitals that treated fewer than 25 breast cancer patients were 18 percent less than at hospitals that performed a larger volume of breast cancer care.</p>
        <p>Dr. Morrow attributed the difference to systems of care at high-volume hospitals, which have teams of specialists, rather than the quality of doctors at small-volume hospitals.</p>
        <p>For example, she said, speed of referrals through a hospital system or overall coordination of care may be important factors.</p>
        <p>Dr. Morrow's team did not examine the competence of the doctors in the study. But she said that ''it would be a serious mistake to interpret this data as saying that the whole explanation was physician quality.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Morrow said that earlier studies had found a correlation between survival after surgery for cancer of the pancreas and esophagus and the number of such procedures performed each year. Similar correlations have been found in some heart surgeries.</p>
