        <p>AT 69, the former senator, cabinet officer and party chairman is enjoying what would be for some the pleasures of retirement, like a power boat on the Severn River or an afternoon walk around the Colonial-era streets of Maryland's capital -- not to mention cheering the Naval Academy's football team.</p>
        <p>But Bill Brock is anything but retired. For several years he had been working quietly, as chairman of Intellectual Development Systems Inc., on a program to help school systems overcome learning problems. For the last few weeks he has been working noisily to rebuild the current presidential nominating system.</p>
        <p>Although he concedes that ''every reform I ever voted for has come back to bite me,'' Mr. Brock is leading an effort among Republican leaders to begin the primary season with the smallest states and put the biggest states, like New York and California, last.</p>
        <p>The plan, if adopted at the Republican convention this summer and put in effect by the states, is intended to enable people in every state to feel involved in the choice of presidential nominees, and thereby in the system generally. This year, for example, Republicans had high turnout in early states, through the March 7 primary. Then, ''it was just like falling off a cliff, in terms of participation,'' Mr. Brock said. ''Nobody came from then on.''</p>
        <p>By starting with small states, the system would encourage lesser-known candidates without lots of money. ''You place your primary emphasis on retail politics, face-to-face campaigning in small settings, small groups where people can ask questions looking the candidate in the eye and hear his response or her response. The candidates can get a much, much clearer sense of what is bothering Americans by walking their neighborhoods than they can by standing in front of a television camera -- or reading a poll.''</p>
        <p>Jim Nicholson, who holds the party chairmanship that Mr. Brock occupied from 1977 to 1981, put him in charge of reinventing the primaries last summer, creating a commission of several party elders.</p>
        <p>Mr. Brock represented Tennessee in the House and the Senate, and after his time as party chairman, when he rebuilt the machine that Ronald Reagan led to victory, he served in the Reagan administration as trade representative and secretary of labor. In the Senate, he cast some votes for what he thought was reform. He supported encouraging the development of political action committees. He voted for the 1974 Federal Election Campaign Act, which imposed a $1,000 limit on campaign contributions, which he said worked pretty well for the 1976, 1980 and 1984 elections, before the blossoming of soft money.</p>
        <p>He does not argue that the new primary system would solve all the problems in the system. Changes in campaign financing are essential, too, he said.</p>
        <p>''I think soft money is an abomination. I think what has happened to P.A.C.'s has dismayed all of us who thought it was a reform when we voted for them in the early 70's after Watergate. Obviously, the $1,000 limit is a problem because it is worth less than $300 now in real terms. So that is ridiculous. And all of these are pieces of the whole. All of these are parts of the problem, and if you try to deal with one aspect and not the complete package, you are not going to get things done.''</p>
        <p>The urgency of acting soon settled on the commission, Mr. Brock said, when ''we saw this whole thing come to a crashing halt, effectively, on the 7th of March. People began to realize that it is not just the financial side, it is the whole process that requires remedy.'' He added, ''Doesn't it scare people that we have elections in America where nobody comes? That is a terrifying statement.''</p>
        <p>Many leaders from big states oppose the plan because they think the nominating contest would end before it reached them. And even if Mr. Brock gets his proposal through the Republican National Committee and the convention, he knows it won't be very effective unless Democrats agree.</p>
        <p>It looks like the Republicans must make the first move. Their current party rules can only be changed by the convention. The Brock plan would ask the convention to allow the national committee to change the rules between conventions. Then a deal could be struck with the Democrats, who can change their rules between conventions.</p>
        <p>MR. BROCK speaks kindly about the Democrats who are watching to see if he will succeed. ''The Democrats have a particular problem,'' he said. ''Their rules are very difficult to change'' because it takes a ''two-thirds majority. It effectively allows almost any significant group of opponents to block reform. That's the challenge they face. I'm very sympathetic to their problem.''</p>
        <p>The Bill Brock who came to Washington in 1963, or even the one who beat Al Gore Sr. for the Senate in 1970, would not have been tolerant of Democrats. But he changed in the Senate.</p>
        <p>''I came in riding my white horse with my armor burnished, ready to slay the dragons of the left,'' he said. ''It was amazing how little I thought of Hubert Humphrey until I got to know him, and then how much I loved him. We didn't have to agree on issues. You know, viewed from afar, people don't look as good as they can look up close. It's really hard to hate somebody that you have to live with and work with. You begin to have an appreciation for and a respect for the process. The system works, and you have to pay attention to it and make sure it continues to work because the world does change.''</p>
