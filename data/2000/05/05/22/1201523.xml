        <p>In the next three weeks trials in Raleigh, N.C., and Memphis will determine the two teams that will represent the United States in the World Women's Teams and the World Open Teams in Maastricht, the Netherlands, starting in August. They will be fortunate, for they will have nearly all their expenses paid. Next year the four teams playing in the Venice Cup and the Bermuda Bowl in Indonesia will do much less well.</p>
        <p>That arises because the players share in the International Team Fund, and the shares will be smaller next year because more players will be collecting. In 1999 the fund collected $55,000, which will help those going to Maastricht.</p>
        <p>The fund is fed by special events at the three national championships and by three games each year at clubs across the country. In one of these, played this month, all the contestants faced the diagramed deal. It helped Adrienne Pear and Florence Libin, playing at the City Club, 50 West 54th Street in Manhattan, achieve one of the best New York scores.</p>
        <p>After a three-diamond opening from East, three no-trump, with a double diamond stopper, was a clear-cut choice for Pear as South. A take-out double might well have taken the partnership into uncharted waters, and the risk of missing a good spade fit was not serious.</p>
        <p>Even if the partnership did have a 5-3 spade fit, no-trump might well provide a better match-point score, and so it proved.</p>
        <p>The opening diamond lead was won with the queen, and a heart was led to the jack and ace. East made the obvious return of the diamond king, and after winning with the ace South cashed the spade ace and the heart king.</p>
        <p>She led to the heart queen and played the club jack for a finesse, prepared to lose a trick to the safe West hand. It was virtually certain that East's vulnerable three-bid was based on a seven-card suit.</p>
        <p>When the club finesse won, a second finesse left this position:</p>
        <p>Diagram</p>
        <p>When the club king was led and West followed, South could overtake with the ace in the knowledge that the queen would appear. Then she cashed the last club, forcing a spade discard from West, and led the heart seven. West had to win and concede two spade tricks at the finish, giving South two overtricks and all the match points.</p>
