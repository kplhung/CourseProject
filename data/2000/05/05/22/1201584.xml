        <p>Car owners and drivers played a game of high-stakes, high-speed musical chairs trying to fill the 33-car field for the 84th running of the Indianapolis 500.</p>
        <p>A. J. Foyt took a gamble on one of his former drivers in an untested car, and with no time to spare, Billy Boat was the last to earn a spot for the race.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, just about all of the big names with big teams filled the first 23 qualifying slots, as the reigning champions from rival open- wheel racing series battled for the pole.</p>
        <p>A driver from the Indy Racing League prevailed, with Greg Ray taking the pole at a four-lap average speed of 223.471 miles per hour in a Dallara-Oldsmobile. CART's Juan Montoya, making his first appearance here, was second at 223.372 m.p.h. in a G Force Oldsmobile.</p>
        <p>Ten positions were available today, and Raul Boesel, a 42-year-old Brazilian, was the fastest, at 222.113 m.p.h. in a G Force Oldsmobile.</p>
        <p>''Yesterday the team decided to wait,'' said Boesel, the 1987 world sports car champion. ''We knew we had a good chance today, and it paid off.''</p>
        <p>Four drivers, Hideshi Matsuda, Boat, Doug Didero and Stan Wattles, crashed today trying to get up to a competitive speed. Matsuda was the most seriously injured, sustaining a fractured right wrist and left knee.</p>
        <p>With 45 minutes until closing, there had been only 30 qualifiers, leaving three spots still open. When Boat crashed at 12:07 p.m. in a Team Pelfrey car, he needed a replacement. The 1998 pole winner contacted his former team owner, Foyt, who won here four times as a driver and last year as owner of Kenny Brack's car. Boat got onto the track, and during his run, his electronic dashboard shorted out. He qualified at 192.105 m.p.h., but as the slowest car he would be bumped if anyone went faster.</p>
        <p>The Indianapolis 500 rules specify that the fastest 33 cars start the race no matter which day they qualify. The fastest driver from today lines up after the slowest from Saturday.</p>
        <p>With thirty minutes remaining,  Jack Miller filled the 33-car field with a time 216.154 m.p.h., so the bumping started.</p>
        <p>Lyn St. James, 53, bumped her way into the field. With 19-year-old Sarah Fisher solidly in the field, this is the first time two women will start the Indianapolis 500, scheduled for next Sunday.</p>
        <p>Boat, 34, became the first of four drivers to be bumped, and he got yet another car from Foyt. It was another backup, which had not turned a wheel before today, that was rolled out to the qualifying line.</p>
        <p>With less than a minute before the closing gun, he hopped in the G Force Oldsmobile and quickly got up to speed. With a four-lap average of 218.872, he became the final qualifier by bumping Miller.</p>
        <p>''I was able to put my foot down and go,'' Boat said, ''which at 6 p.m. on bump day, at Indy, you just have to go for it.''</p>
