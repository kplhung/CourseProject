While you applaud the announcement that five drug companies have offered to cut the price of AIDS drugs in poor countries, you are right that in these countries, health care systems and social services are weak or lacking.

        <p>Re ''Cheaper Drugs to Combat AIDS'' (editorial, May 15):</p>
        <p>Even under ideal conditions, administering many of these drugs is complicated and risky. While you applaud the announcement that five drug companies have offered to cut the price of AIDS drugs in poor countries, you are right that in these countries, health care systems and social services are weak or lacking. It isn't realistic to think that people will get all the information and guidance they need to take their medicines on time and in the right amounts.</p>
        <p>Reducing drug costs is essential and long overdue. But it is good news only if there is a simultaneous push to beef up health care in the developing world and if prices are lowered so medicines are within reach of the people who need them. Anything short of that amounts to little more than a public relations stunt by the pharmaceutical industry.</p>
