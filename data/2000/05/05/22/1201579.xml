        <p>The Nets don't have a coach, a director of basketball operations  or much of a history of good fortune. But they do now hold the No. 1 pick in the 2000 National Basketball Association draft and a chance to begin to reverse their struggles after coming up as the winners of the draft lottery today.</p>
        <p>The Nets, who finished with the league's seventh-worst record, had 44 chances out of 1,001 to obtain the top overall selection, but the Ping-Pong balls fell their way. The organization, which has been undergoing an overhaul with Coach Don Casey being let go and the team's president, Michael Rowe, being reassigned since the end of a disappointing season, suddenly finds itself in an enviable position for once.</p>
        <p>Lewis Katz, the principal owner of the Nets, sat on the podium listening as the June 28 draft order was called off. After the Nets had passed by the No. 7 spot where their record would have placed them, and it came down to the final two spots, Katz sat nervously mouthing silent words to himself.</p>
        <p>When the announcement came that the Vancouver Grizzlies were No. 2, leaving the Nets as the winners, Katz pumped his fist and shouted, ''Yes, yes.''</p>
        <p>''It's so unbelievable,'' Katz said. ''You start out at 40 out of 1,000, and you're thinking, 'I want to be at No. 7, I don't want to lose my position.' Then when you hit 7, it's like, 'I'd like to be No. 3.' And then, all of the sudden, it's like you're at the Academy Awards. It's you.</p>
        <p>''For the Nets, it's absolutely phenomenal. It's an up for a tough season.''</p>
        <p>The Grizzlies, who had the fourth-worst record in the league, moved up to No. 2, and the perennially struggling Los Angeles Clippers dropped to the third pick despite having the worst record. Chicago moved down to No. 4 and also picked up the seventh pick from the Washington Wizards, who owed the pick as a part of a trade if they did not get one of the top three spots.</p>
        <p>With no clear choice for the first overall selection, the Nets must decide whether to use the pick themselves or to trade it away. The thought has been that Kenyon Martin, a 6-foot-9-inch power forward from the University of Cincinnati, would be the top pick in this draft. But Martin is coming off a broken leg and torn ligaments in his ankle and also plays the same position as Keith Van Horn. So the Nets could consider another player, such as Chris Mihm, a 7-foot center from the University of Texas, or Stromile Swift, a 6-8 forward from L.S.U.</p>
        <p>Or they could field offers, such as the one that came, jokingly at this time, from Orlando General Manager John Gabriel. As the Nets celebrated the pick, Gabriel leaned over to Nets General Manager John Nash and offered up the No. 5 and No. 10 picks that the Magic wound up with today. The Magic also has the No. 13 pick.</p>
        <p>''I think that is a decision that is going to be made by a number of people who aren't currently with us,'' Nash said. Nash's own status remains a question with the Nets having begun interviewing candidates for a director of basketball operations, including John Thompson, who was interviewed on Friday. ''It's going to be an organizational decision,'' he said. ''I think it would be inappropriate until the organization is fully intact to be making a decision as important as this.''</p>
        <p>The Nets had the top pick in the draft once previously, in 1990 when they selected Derrick Coleman. Coleman was more of a sure thing than Martin as a talent, but never delivered the lift to the organization that his ability had promised, and he was finally dealt away as a disappointment. This time, the Nets bring back a far more talented roster than the 17-65 team that Coleman joined, but one still with needs. With Jayson Williams's health a question mark and all three of the small forwards from the past season's roster potential free-agent departures, the Nets' most glaring needs are center and small forward.</p>
        <p>''Certainly, we can fill a major void,'' Nash said. ''The question is, can we improve the team even more if we opt to trade the pick? Right now, I wouldn't be predisposed to trading the pick, but as I say, we're going to have some new key management and coaching people in place over the next couple of weeks and I think, in fairness to them, they're going to have significant input.''</p>
