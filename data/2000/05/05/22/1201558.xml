        <p>It turns out that the most momentous act of Vladimir V. Putin's first days as Russia's elected president has not been his choice of a cabinet, or the internal debate over a sweeping economic restructuring plan, or even the approval of two nuclear arms treaties.</p>
        <p>Rather, it is Mr. Putin's mounting of a swift and stunning crusade last week to gut the power and political influence of Russia's 89 governors -- and not coincidentally, perhaps, to enhance his own.</p>
        <p>If the campaign succeeds -- and that seemed more than possible this week -- then Mr. Putin will have reoriented Russia's federal system toward the Kremlin. And the governors, arguably the most powerful and rebellious politicians outside the Kremlin walls, will have been relegated to truly provincial status.</p>
        <p>The Kremlin says that is what Russia needs to pull itself out of the slough that is its 10-year history as an independent nation, and many experts agree. But it will come at the cost of making Mr. Putin, already endowed with czar-like powers by the Constitution, an even more towering figure in Russian politics and government.</p>
        <p>In fact, Moscow's all-powerful mayor, Yuri M. Luzhkov, was quick to attack Mr. Putin's plan as arbitrary and potentially illegal. But many political experts here say Mr. Putin is on the right course.</p>
        <p>''The general tendency is positive because the major obstacle to reforms is the influence of the oligarchs and the governors, whom I call dictators,'' said Sergei Markov, one of the country's top political analysts.</p>
        <p>Lilia Shevtsova, a top analyst at the Moscow office of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said, ''The fact that Mr. Putin wants to crush these authoritarian regimes is a very promising sign.'' She calls the governors robber barons and says reining them in should be one of the new president's top priorities.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin's proposal comes at the peak of his political power now, while he is blessed with a comparatively prosperous economy and a clutch of powerful alliances with the major factions in Parliament. He took quick advantage of it all last week, in effect declaring war on the governors in two prime-time television speeches.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, he proposed to  oust, permanently, all 89 governors and the leaders of their legislatures from their guaranteed seats in Russia's counterpart to the United States Senate, the Federation Council. The move would wipe out the current membership of the 188-seat house, replacing it with lesser regional officials.</p>
        <p>More than that, Mr. Putin said on Wednesday that he would seek legal authority to personally suspend or fire any governor who flouts federal law or defies the Russian Constitution.</p>
        <p>And that's not all: four days earlier, a Putin decree corralled the governors' 89 provinces into 7 new administrative districts, each overseen by a regional official who is answerable directly to Mr. Putin, and no one else.</p>
        <p>On Friday, the semi-official Interfax news service called the proposals ''an attack, one may even say storming'' of the governors' political bastion. Mr. Putin is said to have sprung the plan on top governors last week in a meeting that ran so long that the president's next appointment -- his new prime minister, Mikhail Kasyanov -- cooled his heels for more than an hour.</p>
        <p>The governors, still awed by Mr. Putin's popularity, have reacted cautiously. But few Russians expect them to roll over. For taken together, the proposals have the potential not just to end the their long run as regional potentates, but also to wreak vengeance on the most disobedient of their lot.</p>
        <p>The seven new administrative districts have been billed as a streamlining of the government, replacing the individual envoys to all 89 provinces who served under President Boris N. Yeltsin.</p>
        <p>But they are more than that. Under Mr. Yeltsin, both the envoys and many federal agencies became willing captives of the governors, who supplied them with favors the Kremlin could not or would not provide. Federal officials were dependent on the provinces for everything from office space and telephones to jobs for their families and summer camps for their children.</p>
        <p>That will all change under Mr. Putin. The seven new envoys will work from regional capitals with budgets, housing and offices supplied by the Kremlin, as well as the power to bestow perks on federal officials in their districts. The effect, the administration hopes, will be to bring those officials back under the Kremlin's sway, and thus to bring more pressure to bear on the governors to follow federal orders.</p>
        <p>The proposed reorganization of the Federation Council is potentially even more far-reaching. While details of the plan were not clear last weekend, Mr. Putin apparently intends to replace the council members with provincial officials elected by their peers, diluting the governors' power to control votes on the council.</p>
        <p>The governors, however, stand to lose far more than political power. If they lose their parliamentary seats, they also surrender one of its most coveted benefits: complete immunity from criminal prosecution. And more than a few of them have cause to worry about that.</p>
        <p>Russia's governors have lived high for a long time. As a string of crises and Mr. Yeltsin's desultory rule drained Moscow of money and influence, the far-flung provinces have increasingly made their own way, and some leaders have become corrupt, autocratic or both.</p>
        <p>On the Pacific coast, 5,000 miles from the Kremlin, the governor of the Primoriye region, Yevgeny Nazdratenko, has taken over private businesses, seized control of the press and judiciary, pumped government budgets dry and, according to Mr. Yeltsin's Kremlin, regularly ignored federal decrees.</p>
        <p>Across the country on the Black Sea, Krasnodar Province has been identified by human rights groups as a center of authoritarianism, anti-Semitism and ''extreme xenophobia'' under Gov. Nikolai Kondratenko. On the nearby Caspian, Kalmikiya has threatened secession, veered toward dictatorship and spent lavishly on a ''chess city'' under its chess-obsessed president, Kirsan Ilyumzhinov.</p>
        <p>Some regions have erected trade barriers, treating each other almost like foreign nations. Mr. Putin claims that a fifth of provincial laws run counter to federal legislation. He need not look far: the city of Moscow, a federal district, has paid little attention to warnings that its regulations counter federal law.</p>
        <p>In making his argument to clean up the system, Mr. Putin argues, with some justification, that he won election on a platform of bringing a dangerously undisciplined Russia to heel before it does itself fatal damage, and that reining in such behavior is the first step.</p>
        <p>''This is not just correct today; it is absolutely necessary,'' he said on Wednesday. ''The looseness of power is very costly for millions of average people. The cost of the lack of discipline in the state is our personal security, the inviolability of property and housing and, finally, our own well-being and the future of our children.''</p>
        <p>The president stresses that his proposals conform to the Constitution, that they require Parliament's approval, and that he rejects more draconian options, like arrogating to himself the power to appoint governors.</p>
        <p>Mr. Putin is making his case directly to the people, on television, which suggests that he wants the sort of public mandate that past leaders, including Mr. Yeltsin, rarely bothered to seek.</p>
        <p>His chances of getting what he wants seem good. Although the Federation Council would seem likely to oppose much of the Kremlin's plan, it appears that the Duma, the lower house of Parliament, will overwhelmingly approve it. Both the Duma's Communists and its right-wing party, the Union of Right Forces, have announced their support.</p>
        <p>If the Duma gives Mr. Putin 300 of its 450 votes, a constitutional majority, the Federation Council will be unable to derail the bills even if it votes against them.</p>
