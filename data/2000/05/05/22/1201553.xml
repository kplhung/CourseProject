        <p>The Federal Trade Commission plans to go to Congress this week to seek tough new privacy rules for Internet businesses. But the nation's consumer protection agency is likely to encounter skepticism from key Republicans and from industry groups about the government's ability to impose regulations without stifling the innovation fueling the new economy.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the opposition began mustering its arguments as soon as the F.T.C. reversed its previous policy by voting on Friday to ask Congress for new powers to control the ways Internet companies collect and use information about consumers.</p>
        <p>''A year ago, when the performance of Web sites was rated less favorably than they are currently being rated, the commission voted against legislation,'' said Representative Billy Tauzin, Republican of Louisiana, chairman of the House Commerce subcommittee that oversees Internet privacy.</p>
        <p>''Today with the finding that Web sites have improved dramatically their privacy policies, they are now recommending legislation,'' he said. ''It seems to be a contradiction that needs to be understood.''</p>
        <p>And yet, while high-technology industry groups continue to insist that any new rules are unwarranted and premature, companies themselves have differing views on whether and what types of new laws might be warranted.</p>
        <p>Microsoft insists no legislation is needed. EBay, the auction giant, indicated it could support some sort of minimal regulation if it curtailed states' rights to impose a patchwork of differing rules. Bell Atlantic said baseline rules could be useful.</p>
        <p>The only common theme expressed by Internet businesses over the weekend seemed to be that if Congress proceeds with legislation to regulate consumer privacy protections online, that it do so cautiously.</p>
        <p>''We are all sensitive to this issue,'' said Robert Levitan, chief executive  of Flooz.com, which deals in online gift certificates. ''We know we are in the spotlight and we are going to be held to a higher standard.''</p>
        <p>DoubleClick, which places advertising on Web sites on behalf of other companies, became a lightning rod for online privacy issues after it disclosed a plan -- since deferred -- to combine consumer information gathered online with personal data gathered offline through direct-mail databases and other means.</p>
        <p>''I would like to think that industry could self-regulate, but I think we all have accepted the fact that there will be some regulation,'' Mr. Levitan said. ''We're not jumping up and down complaining about regulation. We're just saying, let's do it wisely.''</p>
        <p>If caution means slow, companies are likely to get their wish. Given the complexity of both election-year politics and the fast-changing medium involved, most lawmakers agreed that the chances of passing Internet privacy legislation this year were all but nil. But this year's debate could set the stage for action next session.</p>
        <p>Although the Internet privacy issue in Congress does not split along party lines, Representative Ed Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who supports strong privacy regulation, predicted on Friday that Republicans would block the consumer protections.</p>
        <p>Representative Tom Davis, Republican of Virginia and co-chairman of the House Internet caucus, responded with the implication that the administration was behind the F.T.C. move. ''This is an election year, and I think sometimes the direction they get from up high is to stir this up a little bit.''</p>
        <p>Still, it remained unclear over the weekend whether the White House would back the F.T.C. effort, which comes after the recent completion of a survey by the commission that found that only about 20 percent of major companies on the Internet had adequate standards for protecting the privacy of Internet users. Since 1997, the Clinton administration has pushed a laissez-faire approach to the Internet. And just last week, a top Commerce Department official told a House hearing on privacy that self-regulation appeared to be working.</p>
        <p>With both parties trying to attract the support -- and dollars -- of the technology industry, the issue could become a tricky one politically for Vice President Al Gore.</p>
        <p>Details of the F.T.C.'s survey findings and its legislative proposal will not be released until the agency conducts briefings around Washington on Monday.</p>
        <p>But a government official who has seen the 60-page recommendation said it would suggest only moderate legislation to set baseline rules that could be used in conjunction with self-regulation efforts like the seal programs that are used by some Web sites to certify they follow their stated privacy practices. After three years of monitoring the progress of privacy on the Internet, the official said, the F.T.C. had not seen sufficient protections to avoid regulation.</p>
        <p>''This is one step forward, not a massive leap into a highly regulated, draconian bureaucratic structure,'' said the official, who predicted Mr. Tauzin and others would be less critical after seeing the details of the Web survey and the F.T.C.'s recommendations.</p>
        <p>But industry groups began pre-emptive strikes over the weekend.</p>
        <p>On Sunday, the Direct Marketing Association released its own survey of Web sites showing that 93 percent of major Web sites posted privacy policies and that most of those gave customers notice of how that information was used and the opportunity to keep that information from being transferred to third parties.</p>
        <p>''Clearly, self-regulation has taken hold with lightning speed,'' said H. Robert Wientzen, president and chief executive of the association.</p>
        <p>The Information Technology Association of America issued a statement from its president, Harris Miller, who called the F.T.C. report ''a first step down the slippery slope of government regulation of the Internet.''</p>
        <p>Internet company executives, meanwhile, seemed most concerned about the effect new regulations might have on innovation.</p>
        <p>Just hours after the F.T.C. voted on Friday, Microsoft and several other companies were demonstrating technologies that are being developed to protect consumers at a weekend privacy retreat in Leesburg, Va., that was sponsored by the United States Chamber of Commerce's National Chamber Foundation.</p>
        <p>Richard Purcell, director of corporate privacy for Microsoft, pointed to efforts to incorporate privacy protection technologies into Web-browsing software. ''This is not the proper time to stop or chill that very substantial effort that is being made,'' Mr. Purcell said.</p>
        <p>Another company, the DataTreasury Corporation, showed lawmakers technology that allows consumers and businesses to conduct all of their online transactions through DataTreasury's secure system.</p>
        <p>''Whatever regulations are implemented today may not be relevant tomorrow,'' said Michael Hershman, chairman of Decision Strategies Fairfax International, a security company in Fairfax, Va. ''This technology creates an entirely different mode of doing business.</p>
        <p>''It's hard to predict how these regulations might be written and how they might be enforced,'' he added. ''Once you start down that road you are never sure where you might end up. I've seen many regulations written that you think say one thing and do another.''</p>
        <p>Tom Tauke, an executive with Bell Atlantic, said some action might be appropriate.</p>
        <p>''There can be steps taken in public policy that can be very helpful in creating a climate in which businesses can flourish and consumers' privacy can be protected,'' Mr. Tauke said. ''I don't think that Congress should slow down in the privacy area. I think Congress should get it right.''</p>
        <p>Other companies said baseline federal legislation was better than the patchwork of laws being considered by states.</p>
        <p>Tod Cohen, public policy director for eBay in Washington, said, ''We would work with the F.T.C., Congress and the administration to develop a national standard'' -- provided it pre-empted further action by states to regulate Internet privacy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Levitan agreed. ''We need a uniform code across the country,'' he said. ''We need a standard law on privacy and taxation. But let's do it wisely and make it easy for Internet companies to comply.''</p>
