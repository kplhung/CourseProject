        <p>Georgetown University took team titles in both the 124th annual men's IC4A track and field championships and the 17th annual women's East Coast Athletic Conference championships yesterday at Princeton University's Weaver Stadium.</p>
        <p>The Hoyas closed fast to take the IC4A crown by winning the 3,200-meter relay in 7 minutes 27.48 seconds and by placing second to East Carolina in the concluding 1,600 relay. They finished with 66 points; Liberty was second with 63.</p>
        <p>Georgetown's women took the ECAC title with 79 points, topping Pittsburgh's second-place score of 67 points. Relays again proved decisive, with the Hoyas winning the 3,200 relay (8:45.61) and the 1,600 relay (3:35.40).</p>
        <p>The Seton Hall sophomore Nolle Graham, a graduate of William Howard Taft High School in the Bronx who is a candidate for Jamaica's Olympic team, was named the outstanding performer in the women's meet, after winning the 100 meters (11.73), the 200 (23.63) and anchoring Seton Hall's winning 400-meter relay team. She placed second in the long jump -- only a centimeter out of first place -- on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Seton Hall's Ned Brooks won the IC4A 800 in 1:50.29. But Seton Hall settled for second in the 3,200 relay, as Georgetown's runner on the anchor leg, Ezra Richards, passed Brooks in the final 50 meters.</p>
        <p>Connecticut's Bethany Hart set an ECAC meet record of 197 feet 10 inches in winning the hammer throw.</p>
