        <p>If Major League Baseball officials can find time when they are not probing the baseball or brushback pitches or intemperate speech, they need to investigate a claim that arose at Shea Stadium yesterday in the aftermath of the Mets' battering of Randy Johnson. Johnson, several members of the Arizona Diamondbacks asserted, is human.</p>

        <p>If Major League Baseball officials can find time when they are not probing the baseball or brushback pitches or intemperate speech, they need to investigate a claim that arose at Shea Stadium yesterday in the aftermath of the Mets' battering of Randy Johnson. Johnson, several members of the Arizona Diamondbacks asserted, is human.</p>
        <p>Mark Connor, the team's pitching coach, said it. So did Damian Miller, the catcher yesterday. Even Jay Bell, one of the wiser members of the Diamondbacks, offered that view. ''Randy's human,'' Bell said.</p>
        <p>Before his 7-6 loss yesterday, certainly, they or anyone else would have been hard pressed to substantiate that claim. But if they are right, their revelation may be most helpful to their opponents and most destructive to themselves. If Randy Johnson is indeed human, it creates the possibility of an entirely different outcome when he pitches every fifth day.</p>
        <p>Johnson approached yesterday's start against the Mets as the National League leader in victories, strikeouts, shutouts, complete games, innings pitched, lowest opponents' batting average, overall earned run average and earned run average at home and on the road, at night and in daylight. His season E.R.A. read 0.97, and that really doesn't suggest a human species, not in today's game when the composite league E.R.A. is five times greater.</p>
        <p>''Randy obviously has set a very high standard for himself, one that's very tough to meet,'' Buck Showalter, his manager, said.</p>
        <p>So, if Arizona was to be believed, this was the human Randy the Mets swatted around the ballyard. ''Even Randy Johnson can't go out every fifth day and be unhittable,'' Miller said. ''This is the big leagues, you know?''</p>
        <p>It was presumably the alien form of Johnson that struck out batters for 13 of the 20 outs he recorded. It was the mere human who gave up eight extra-base hits for the eight hits he allowed: five doubles and three home runs.</p>
        <p>Slugging percentage is computed by dividing total bases by times at bat. In Johnson's first nine starts, teams compiled a .268 slugging percentage against him. The Mets amassed 22 total bases in 27 at-bats. Those figures produce an .815 slugging percentage.</p>
        <p>''Location,'' Connor said, explaining the reason for Johnson's problems. ''A lot of the balls were in the middle. He was behind in a lot of counts.'' Was this the first time this season the left-hander has had trouble with location? The coach said emphatically, ''Oh, yes.''</p>
        <p>Johnson especially had trouble with the location of a pitch to Mike Piazza in the third inning. The location when the ball reached the plate was bad enough; when it landed, it was oh-so-much worse. ''It was a pitch up and over the plate,'' Miller said. ''The slider didn't do much, just kind of hung up there about belt high right down the middle.''</p>
        <p>And the location when the ball reached its final resting place?</p>
        <p>''It's probably still circling the stadium right now,'' Johnson said. The ball landed in the third-highest of four tiers of seats, the ones painted green near the orange pole separating fair from foul at the end of the left-field line. The Mets, using their computerized chart, estimated the distance at 492 feet.</p>
        <p>''I made some mistakes,'' Johnson said, offering no apologies or excuses, ''and when you make mistakes to good hitters, hang pitches, then they hit them a long ways.''</p>
        <p>The Mets had cracked three doubles when their first inning was only eight pitches old. Joe McEwing, a .190 hitter, who had previously managed only two hits in 12 at-bats against Johnson, produced the first double, rapped another in the fifth inning as the climax of a 12-pitch confrontation, then heaped injury upon insult in the seventh by smashing a home run.</p>
        <p>The home run, which cut the Mets' two-run deficit in half, followed a 1-1 pitch that Johnson thought was a strike but Umpire Tim Timmons called a ball.</p>
        <p>''When you feel like you throw strikes, you want them to be called,'' Johnson said, refusing to say anything more about the call or link it to the ensuing development. Miller offered more of an insight.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes when he doesn't get that pitch,'' the catcher said, ''he'll get a little bit more erratic instead of just saying, 'O.K., it's a ball, I have to make a quality pitch right here.' When he doesn't, he gets in trouble.''</p>
        <p>Johnson struck out Derek Bell after McEwing connected, but then Edgardo Alfonzo tied the score with another home run. ''Alfonzo's a hitter that has a history against us,'' Johnson said.</p>
        <p>In the first game of their division playoff series last October, Alfonzo started Johnson on his way to a loss by whacking a first-inning home run against him. After the Mets loaded the bases against Johnson in the ninth inning of the 4-4 game, Alfonzo crushed a grand slam against Bobby Chouinard.</p>
        <p>Alfonzo hit yesterday's home run on the second pitch Johnson threw to him. In the first inning, he swung at the first pitch and doubled just after Bell had done the same thing. Piazza hit his monstrous home run on the third pitch.</p>
        <p>''It was surprising how they came out and swung the bat right away,'' Miller said. ''I think their plan was to get him early, before he got two strikes on them. They were swinging at a lot of first pitches. If I was facing Randy Johnson, that's what I would do. I'd swing early in the count.''</p>
        <p>The Mets had not discussed a plan, Piazza said, but they were aware that some hitters had had success against Johnson by swinging at an early pitch. If that word gets around, Johnson may become permanently human.</p>
