        <p>Letter from John O McGinnis says Jack M Balkin's assault on Supreme Court decision on Violence Against Women Act (May 17 Op-Ed) provides example of modern legal academy's tendency to label any decision favoring limited government as racist rather than address its reasoning on merits</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Jack M. Balkin's assault on the Supreme Court's decision on the Violence Against Women Act (''The Court Defers to a Racist Era,'' Op-Ed, May 17) provides an example of the modern legal academy's tendency to label any decision favoring limited government as racist rather than address its reasoning on the merits.</p>
        <p>The justices who rendered the civil rights cases held, and the court has reaffirmed, that because the 14th Amendment forbids states rather than private individuals from violating rights, Congress's power under Section 5 of the amendment extends only to remedy state rather than private action.</p>

        <p>Mr. Balkin's own conception that Congress has the power to regulate private activity in the name of equal citizenship would give it full authority over all relations among free citizens.</p>
