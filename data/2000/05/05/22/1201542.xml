        <p>Mystery and magic are the magnets that draw fans to Harry Potter, the fictional British schoolboy-cum-literary-phenomenon who has made millions of pounds and dollars for its author and publishers. And now the book series' publicists are trying a little sorcery themselves, casting a spell of secrecy they hope will conjure the book-selling event of the year, if not the decade.</p>
        <p>The fourth volume in the Harry Potter series is set to be published on July 8 in both Britain and the United States -- unlike the last three, in which the American releases came several months after the British debuts. And this time, a substantial degree of effort is going into ensuring that as little as possible is known about the book's contents in advance.</p>
        <p>There will be, for instance, none of the advance copies that usually land on reviewers' desks a few months before publication. No one is promoting prepublication interviews with the author, J. K. Rowling. Indeed, according to the American and British publishers, Ms. Rowling will be giving no interviews at all until publication day.</p>
        <p>The plot is a secret. So is the cover design. Even the title is supposed to remain closely guarded. All that the British publisher, Bloomsbury, is prepared to acknowledge is that this fourth and latest in a planned seven-book series will be a whopping 600 pages -- twice the length of previous Harry Potters. (The United States publisher, the Arthur A. Levine Books imprint of Scholastic Books, says its version will be closer to 700 pages because of a different layout and illustrations.)</p>
        <p>''This book is really under wraps,'' said Judy Corman, a spokeswoman for Scholastic.</p>
        <p>According to Bloomsbury in London, the reason for the secrecy is the author's wish that children's enjoyment of the book not be spoiled by advance word about the plot. ''The author was very concerned about this,'' said Rosamund de la Hey, head of children's books sales and marketing at Bloomsbury. Both publishers said that only a handful of people at either house had been given a peek of the text itself.</p>
        <p>But one result of the secrecy, of course, is to stoke the fevered imaginations of countless children -- and not a few adults, too -- about a book that is already in such demand that advance Internet orders kept it near the top of Amazon.com's best-seller list last week. (It had earlier been No. 1, but was bumped to second place by advance orders of a thriller to be released on Tuesday by Tyndale House, ''The Indwelling: the Beast Takes Possession,'' by Tim F. Lahaye and Jerry B. Jenkins.)</p>
        <p>''This is quite a classic marketing ruse,'' Rita Clifton, chief executive of Interbrand, Newell &amp; Sorrell, a brand consultancy, said of the Harry Potter campaign. ''It's like launching a new car. There is quite obsessive secrecy. All the news is kept under strict control. And you create a sense of expectation and anticipation. Any leaks would dilute the excitement.''</p>
        <p>Not only that, but Bloomsbury's soaring stock price may benefit, too. ''Having a lot of Harry Potter razzmatazz all helps,'' said Louise Barton, a media analyst with the brokerage firm of Investec Henderson Crosthwaite, even though the Harry Potter books are an important but not dominant part of Bloomsbury's attraction to investors. From a one-year low of $:2.55 ($3.79) before the Harry Potter phenomenon zoomed into the stratosphere last year, Bloomsbury's stock has risen to a close of $:7.35 on Friday.</p>
        <p>The British and American publishers are clearly calculating that when the floodgates of pent-up demand burst on July 8 the supply will be there to meet the expected clamor for a book whose predecessors have sold a combined 20.8 million copies in the United States and an additional 7 million in Britain and the rest of the English-speaking world. Bloomsbury's first print order is for a million copies, retailing at $:14.99 ($22.50). Scholastic's is for 3.8 million, selling at $25.95 each.</p>
        <p>Last year, the third book in the series -- ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' -- had first-print runs of 900,000 in the United States and 275,000 in Britain and the rest of the English-speaking world, which includes markets like Canada, South Africa and Australia.</p>
        <p>And when the moment of publication arrives, the secrecy is to give way to what the publishers plan as an explosion of stunts to provide what Ms. Clifton called ''the dry ice, the puffs of smoke to heighten the drama.''</p>
        <p>Nigel Newton, Bloomsbury's chief executive, said that a train with a steam locomotive would be waiting at a mock-up of the fictional platform -- platform 9 3/4 -- at Kings Cross Station in London where, in all four books, Harry Potter slips between the real and the magical worlds to travel to the Hogwarts boarding school.</p>
        <p>Then, for four days or so, the train will tour several British cities: Oxford, Birmingham, Manchester, York, Newcastle and Perth. ''That was supposed to be a secret,'' Mr. Newton said in an interview at Bloomsbury's offices in Soho Square.</p>
        <p>The train itself -- the oldest in Britain, Mr. Newton said, with cars dating to 1891 and 1912 -- will figure into a marketing maneuver that some young readers might recognize from Roald Dahl's ''Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,'' in which children compete furiously for scarce golden candy wrappers that gain access to Willie Wonka's magical chocolate factory.</p>
        <p>Booksellers will have vouchers to give to the first children in their shops to buy the new ''Harry Potter,'' Mr. Newton said. The vouchers will buy access to the train when it halts in the stations along the route, with the author, Ms. Rowling, on board to sign copies.</p>
        <p>The handouts could very well create the same king of stampede for first copies of the book as happened last year, when the third book in the series was timed for release at 3:45 p.m. in Britain, just when schools let out.</p>
        <p>Mr. Newton said the cost of chartering the train was a secret, of course, though ''less than you might think.'' A spokesman for the company that rents it out -- both the train and the company are called the Queen of Scots -- said the usual price was around $22,000 a day.</p>
        <p>While both the British and American publishers deny it, there does seem to be an element of competition worthy of Harry Potter's fictional game of quidditch over who gets to sell the books first.</p>
        <p>In the United States, Ms. Corman at Scholastic said, many booksellers are planning to open at midnight on July 7 to cope with the anticipated rush. Doing so would give the American publishers a six-hour start on Bloomsbury, which had initially intended to publish the books at 11 a.m., London time (6 a.m., Eastern Standard Time), Bloomsbury is now trying to decide when the bookstore doors should be thrown open, Ms. de la Hey said.</p>
        <p>For its part, Scholastic is running a sweepstakes through its own magazines to provide 5,000 winners with a copy of the new book delivered on the day of publication. Ms. Corman said planes would tow Harry Potter fliers above American beaches, and, at midnight on July 7, a Harry Potter news ticker will illuminate Times Square. And packs of promotional materials are being sent to 15,000 American bookstores.</p>
        <p>With the books being published on the same day in the United States and Britain, the publishers hope to pre-empt the kind of Internet arbitrage that erupted last year when frustrated American buyers went to British Web sites to buy the third ''Harry Potter'' book before the release of the American edition two months later.</p>
        <p>The title, whatever it is, will be the same in both countries, too -- unlike the first book, which was called ''Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone'' in Britain but ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone'' in the United States. But the American edition, according to both publishers, will be more lavishly illustrated.</p>
        <p>For Bloomsbury, the publication will be a high point along a trail of planned events the company hopes will keep its sales, and stock, aloft. Warner Brothers is planning to release the first Harry Potter movie next year. Bloomsbury has an expanding list of new and established authors of literary novels. It has signed a talent-spotting deal with the Creative Artists Agency in Hollywood. And Bloomsbury's reference division is developing a series of databases, including a recently introduced ''Business Bible'' for executives and investors.</p>
        <p>''The pipeline is very full of major new projects,'' Mr. Newton said, ''and I think the market has recognized that.''</p>
