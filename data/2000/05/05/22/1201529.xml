        <p>Working Relationships</p>
        <p>By train, the little town was but a 15-minute ride from the Gare St.-Lazare in Paris in 1871, when Claude Monet settled there. Its name was Argenteuil. In the six years Monet spent there he was often visited by his avant-garde colleagues: Boudin, Caillebotte, Manet, Renoir and Sisley. Through the years they worked in the open air, at times side by side, recording scenes in and around Argenteuil. In time its name became synonymous with the style of divided light and color that became known as Impressionism. Beginning on Sunday, more than 50 of their paintings, many rarely seen outside private collections, go on view through Aug. 20 in ''The Impressionists at Argenteuil'' at the National Gallery of Art in Washington. Information: (202) 737-4215.</p>

        <p>Turning Point</p>
        <p>Maxfield Parrish bridged the worlds of high art and popular culture with book and magazine illustrations and posters that appealed to a mass audience. From Friday through Aug. 6 more than 140 paintings, drawings, prints, photographs and related materials will be assembled in ''Maxfield Parrish, 1870-1966'' at the Brooklyn Museum of Art. Described as the first critical survey of Parrish, the exhibition is organized chronologically, beginning with his work in the late 1890's and early 1900's, when he developed his vivid and singular approach to art. Information: (718) 638-5000.</p>
