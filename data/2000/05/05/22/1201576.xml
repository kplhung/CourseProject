        <p>As of last night, Glen Sather said he still had not heard back from Madison Square Garden President Dave Checketts; Sather surmised he was probably busy with the Knicks.</p>
        <p>But Sather, the Garden's first choice for the Rangers' vacancy at team president, did not sound worried.</p>
        <p>''I don't expect to hear from them for a few days,'' Sather said from Edmonton yesterday. ''I've only been unemployed for one day. I'm not in a hurry to do anything.''</p>
        <p>Sather may not be, but Cal Nichols, the chairman of the 37-member board that owns the Edmonton Oilers, apparently is. Nichols said yesterday that the Oilers' general manager job is there for Edmonton Coach Kevin Lowe to take. Nichols also said National Hockey League Commissioner Gary Bettman was involved in the negotiations that led to Sather's resignation as Edmonton team president and general manager on Thursday.</p>
        <p>Nichols added that he intended to speak with John Muckler, a former Oilers coach, about a job in the Edmonton organization. Nichols said he did not know if he had to get permission from the Rangers to speak with Muckler, who was fired as coach of the Rangers on March 28, at the same time that the team president and general manager Neil Smith was let go. Muckler has a year remaining on his contract. And the Rangers still owe him around $1 million. ''Yes, he does have to get permission,'' Muckler said yesterday.</p>
