        <p>Creative executives are moving at two agencies owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>
        <p>McCann-Erickson/A&amp;L in San Francisco has found a top creative executive after losing Gary Topolewski, who had agreed to take the job but then changed his mind and joined the Playa del Rey, Calif. office of TBWA/Chiat/Day, part of the TBWA Worldwide unit of the Omnicom Group.</p>
        <p>This time, McCann-Erickson/A&amp;L is turning to a sibling shop to fill the post, which became vacant in February when Steve Sweitzer left after only five months. Kevin Moehlenkamp, 36, is leaving the Troy, Mich., office of McCann-Erickson, where he had been executive vice president and executive creative director, to become executive vice president and executive creative director at McCann-Erickson/A&amp;L. In Troy, Mr. Moehlenkamp will be succeeded by Dave Moore, 38, a senior vice president and group creative director at the McCann New York office. The agency is part of the McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising unit of the McCann-Erickson World Group.</p>
        <p>And at Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston, Michael Sheehan, 39, was named president and chief creative officer, succeeding Fred Bertino, 42, who is leaving to become partner and president at the new Boston office of Square One Advertising, called Square One/East. Mr. Sheehan is rejoining Hill, Holliday from the Chicago office of DDB Worldwide, part of Omnicom, where he had been executive creative director.</p>
