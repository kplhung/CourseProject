        <p>The city's efforts to cut local taxes are being threatened by the State Legislature's proposal to increase pension benefits for city government workers, the Giuliani administration and City Council leaders say.</p>
        <p>City leaders also say the proposed changes jeopardize their ability to keep the city financially stable and settle contracts with city workers.</p>
        <p>The proposed state legislation would give automatic cost-of-living increases to retired city employees, cut veteran city employees' contributions toward their pensions, and create a new retirement-incentive program. The battle over the legislation is the latest in an escalating tug of war over who should control how New York City raises and spends its money.</p>
        <p>Last year, over the objection of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani and the City Council, the Legislature repealed the city's commuter tax, costing New York City about $400 million a year. As a result, tax cuts planned for city residents and businesses were abandoned.</p>
        <p>This year, the city has an even larger tax cut plan on the table. But administration officials and the City Council speaker, Peter F. Vallone, are warning that the pension legislation, as well as measures already incorporated in the state budget plan, like a cap on state aid to the homeless in the city, could cost the city as much as $1.2 billion.</p>
        <p>That could again force the city to reduce or scale back its own tax cuts, while also perhaps requiring it to spend money it has in reserve just to balance the $37.34 billion budget for the 2001 fiscal year, city budget officials said.</p>
        <p>It would also reduce the amount available for the city to earmark for settlements with about 300,000 city workers whose contracts expire in the coming year, the officials said.</p>
        <p>''What they are considering doing is absolutely irresponsible,'' said Adam L. Barsky, the director of Mr. Giuliani's Office of Management and Budget.</p>
        <p>Mr. Vallone, who said he intended to join the Giuliani administration in lobbying against the measures, added, ''It is not only arrogant, but it is absolutely wrong.''</p>
        <p>Union leaders defend the proposed pension changes, saying they would give retirees a better standard of living and make their benefits competitive with those approved recently for transit workers and other government employees.</p>
        <p>''When inflation goes up, a retiree's pension should go up,'' said Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers and of the Municipal Labor Committee. ''Retired city employees should not have to make a decision between paying their rent or their medical expenses.'' Nearly 40 states have  made similar modifications to their pension plans, she said.</p>
        <p>City officials said they were not opposed to considering increased pension benefits for more than 100,000 retirees, but wanted to make their own decisions about what the city could afford and how quickly it could afford it. If the state wants to pay for pension changes with state funds, city officials would have no objection.</p>
        <p>''They are taking away our ability to make choices we think will be best for the city, while at the same time threatening our financial stability,'' Mr. Barsky said, maintaining that the cost-of-living increase for retirees could cost the city $1 billion in the 2001 fiscal year. The city is urging that the program be scaled back so that it would cost no more than $300 million to $500 million.</p>
        <p>State officials and legislative leaders acknowledged yesterday that the cost-of-living plan -- which has been backed at least in concept by Gov. George E. Pataki, Comptroller H. Carl McCall and key members of the Legislature -- is expensive, but they said details that could affect the ultimate price tag are still being worked out.</p>
        <p>''There is no specific agreement that has been reached, so any projection of a fiscal impact would be purely speculative,'' said Joseph E. Conway, a spokesman for Governor Pataki's budget office.</p>
        <p>Mr. Conway; a spokeswoman for Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver; and Assemblyman Herman D. Farrell Jr., who is chairman of the Assembly's Ways and Means Committee; said yesterday that they were prepared to meet with city officials to discuss their concerns.</p>
        <p>The city's financial picture, at least for now, remains extremely healthy, with budget officials projecting another record surplus of about $3 billion when the current fiscal year ends on June 30. Even if state officials enact many of the measures the Giuliani administration is opposing, city budget officials said they were confident they could get through the coming fiscal year without major spending cuts.</p>
        <p>But several of the city's planned tax cuts for 2001, including halving the 14 percent surcharge on the personal income tax and eliminating the commercial rent tax, might need to be curtailed or abandoned, city officials said.</p>
        <p>''That would be terrible and incredibly unfair to the city,'' said City Councilman Herbert E. Berman, a Brooklyn Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee.</p>
        <p>Negotiations over the tax cuts and other aspects of the city's 2001 fiscal budget are to begin in earnest this week, but the uncertainty associated with the pension-related costs will complicate that effort.</p>
        <p>The real trouble for the city would come in the next fiscal year, 2002. The current projected deficit for 2002 is $1.8 billion, but if the pension changes are approved, that could grow to between $3.5 billion and $4.4 billion, city budget officials said, a dangerously high level.</p>
        <p>The deficit could also grow because of contract negotiations with all of the city workers' unions. Each 1 percent raise offered to employees would cost the city about $160 million a year.</p>
        <p>A final major budget risk for the city is the $835 million windfall the city could lose over the next two years if the Giuliani administration and labor unions cannot agree to a so-called restart of the pension fund by the end of next month.</p>
        <p>The restart would lower the city's contributions because it would revalue the pension assets after taking into consideration unusually high investment profits in the last three years. The Giuliani administration wants to use those savings to pay for general city services and tax cuts, while the unions want the savings to help pay for raises, as previous pension restarts indirectly did in 1991 and 1995.</p>
