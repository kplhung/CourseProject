        <p>The Chinese government said today that it had approved sending a pair of pandas to the National Zoo in Washington as part of a program to breed the endangered animals in captivity.</p>
        <p>To get the pandas, the Smithsonian Institution, which runs the zoo, will donate $1 million a year for 10 years to the Chinese for panda research and conservation. The Chinese have similar arrangements with zoos in Atlanta and San Diego.</p>
        <p>The National Zoo has been without a panda since the Nov. 28 death of Hsing-Hsing, who was given a lethal injection because of irreversible kidney disease. His mate, Ling-Ling, died in 1992.</p>
        <p>The pair produced five offspring but none lived more than five days.</p>
        <p>Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing came to Washington when the Nixon administration was reopening relations with China. The announcement about another pair comes during a debate over trade between the United States and China.</p>
        <p>When word of the negotiations surfaced last month, Lawrence Small, secretary of the Smithsonian, said the institution had raised $5.8 million toward the fee set by the Chinese, which then was $8 million.</p>
        <p>David J. Umansky, a spokesman for the Smithsonian, said talks were under way with prospective donors.</p>
        <p>Among those who have pledged to make donations are the family of J. Williard Marriott Jr., of the Marriott hotel chain, which promised $1.6 million; Ruth Holmberg, who is on the Smithsonian's national board and is a member of the Sulzberger family, which controls The New York Times Company, $1 million; and the AES Corporation and the Chubb Corporation, $800,000 each.</p>
