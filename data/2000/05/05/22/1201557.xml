        <p>TO the British, it is a brand of alcoholic beverage. To fans of John F. Kennedy, it is the subject of profiles. To the Cowardly Lion, it is reason to see the Wizard. And to Land Rover North America, it is the centerpiece of a revamped advertising and marketing campaign, the first created by the company's new agency, GSD&amp;M in Austin, Tex.</p>
        <p>The subject? Courage, of course.</p>
        <p>And what, pray tell, could be the rationale for associating a quality like courage with a line of sport utility vehicles? Maybe the owner of a New Beetle driving on a road crowded with luxury off-road vehicles is courageous.</p>
        <p>Actually, to the company and the agency, courage is shorthand for a skein of words that begin with ''c'' and serve to flatter the would-be buyer: character, conviction, creativity and curiosity.</p>
        <p>''It's what we call the maverick mindset,'' said Roy Spence, president at GSD&amp;M. That mindset, he said, is prevalent among ''those who in the 21st century will be the builders, the architects, of the next economy.''</p>
        <p>In interviews last week, Mr. Spence joined executives at GSD&amp;M and Land Rover North America to discuss the campaign, which expands today into television with commercials on local broadcast stations and national cable networks like A&amp;E and Discovery (natch). The initial two spots -- for the Discovery Series II, the best-selling Land Rover model -- portray courage in unconventional ways.</p>
        <p>In one commercial, a demurely clad pregnant woman gamely walks on a beach populated by younger women in revealing bikinis. In the other commercial, a couple on the way to the opera stops on a rain-slicked highway to help a stray dog.</p>
        <p>''It's not about describing the attributes and benefits of the vehicle on-road or off-road,'' said Alicia Kriese, senior vice president and group account director for Land Rover at GSD&amp;M. ''It's about taking your own road.''</p>
        <p>The ''Courage'' theme is continued through the other parts of the campaign: print, radio, billboards and posters. For instance, a radio spot describes how the vehicles ''have driven in the harshest conditions known to man, from the blistering Gobi desert to the oxygen-deprived Himalayas.''</p>
        <p>GSD&amp;M is a creatively focused shop known for campaigns for blue-chip brands like Southwest Airlines and Wal-Mart. This is the agency's first effort for an automotive client.</p>
        <p>''We were looking for an agency with a strong culture and ability to build our brand equity,'' said Jim Selwa, vice president for marketing at Land Rover North America in Lanham, Md. ''We picked GSD&amp;M because of a cultural connect.''</p>
        <p>GSD&amp;M was selected in late March after a review that had lasted almost three months. The incumbent agency of 13 years, Grace &amp; Rothschild in New York, which introduced Land Rover products to American consumers, declined to take part.</p>
        <p>GSD&amp;M was one of three finalists in the review along with two other agencies seeking their initial car accounts: Crispin Porter &amp; Bogusky in Miami and Kirshenbaum Bond &amp; Partners in New York. All three were give an assignment on Discovery to determine which would be awarded the creative duties on the company's account, with billings estimated at $30 million.</p>
        <p>''The key insight from GSD&amp;M was that the brand was not being viewed as accessible enough,'' said Kim McCullough, model manager for Discovery at Land Rover North America. ''People thought it cost $50,000, which is what Range Rover costs.'' That's the more expensive of the two products sold in North America by Land Rover.</p>
        <p>''We knew we had to change that price perception,'' Ms. McCullough said, ''and get it in line with where the car is.'' That's why there are numerous mentions of the Discovery's starting sticker of ''$33,975 M.S.R.P.,'' which several ads cheekily define as ''manufacturer's surprising retail price.''</p>
        <p>The final work from Grace &amp; Rothschild was for Range Rover, Mr. Selwa said, adding: ''We're now working with GSD&amp;M on a campaign for the 2001 Range Rover, due in fall 2000. Then in the next 18 months we'll introduce Freelander, which is to be priced around $25,000 to $26,000.''</p>
        <p>Sales for Land Rover North America last year totaled just under 30,000 vehicles, Mr. Selwa said, fueled by a 50 percent increase for Discovery. The goal for 2000 is 31,000, he added, and then a leap to 45,000 to 47,000 when the lower-priced Freelander becomes part of the lineup.</p>
        <p>Media duties for Land Rover are handled by Optimedia International U.S. in New York, part of Publicis S.A. Land Rover is part of BMW A.G., which agreed days before the review ended to sell the brand to the Ford Motor Company.</p>
        <p>That could jeopardize the GSD&amp;M hold on the account because the agency is part of the Omnicom Group, which owns shops like BBDO Worldwide and Merkley Newman Harty. They handle brands like Dodge and Mercedes-Benz for a major Ford competitor, DaimlerChrysler. Ford frowns on working with agencies that are part of holding companies owning other agencies handling accounts for DaimlerChrysler or General Motors.</p>
        <p>''We see nothing from the creative side of the business'' that would warrant concerns over conflicts, Mr. Selwa said. ''BMW, a strong rival of Mercedes-Benz, didn't have an issue with GSD&amp;M.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spence offered Ford executives some tongue-in-cheek advice based on the new Land Rover credo: ''They have to have courage.''</p>
