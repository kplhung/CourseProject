        <p>Senator Albert Arnold Gore of Tennessee never ran a negative campaign. In his first senatorial race, against an octogenarian incumbent, Kenneth McKellar, in the Democratic primary of 1952, he told friends it would be unseemly to make an issue of his opponent's age.</p>

        <p>Senator Albert Arnold Gore of Tennessee never ran a negative campaign. In his first senatorial race, against an octogenarian incumbent, Kenneth McKellar, in the Democratic primary of 1952, he told friends it would be unseemly to make an issue of his opponent's age.</p>
        <p>That season's hot tag lines: ''Thinking feller, vote for McKellar,'' versus ''Think some more, and vote for Gore.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore won that one, and 18 years later his political career also ended on the high road. In that last losing race, against Bill Brock, a Republican, in 1970, he never aggressively answered a range of attacks, including the untrue accusation that he had personally benefited by routing Interstate 40 through land he owned and the unfair suggestion that he had forgotten his roots while chasing after the Kennedys at Georgetown dinner parties.</p>
        <p>The Watergate investigation showed that Nixon operatives had poured illegal campaign funds into the race. Some of the money came from Richard Mellon Scaife, the same conservative who later spent millions on anti-Clinton investigations and activities.</p>
        <p>And the man who defeated Senator Gore eventually apologized for the divisive tone of the campaign. His slogan, designed to appeal to disaffected whites supporting George Wallace, was ''Bill Brock believes in the things we believe in.''</p>
        <p>Born poor in the remote settlement of Possum Hollow, Tenn., Mr. Gore lived through the worst of the Depression and spent seven years working his way through college by teaching in a one-room school -- he would spend one year earning money, then the next year spending it on his studies.</p>
        <p>He loved music, played a mean fiddle, and always said he ran for office because as a kid he had seen the picture of a cousin who was running for the State Legislature on a utility pole and liked the idea of seeing his own face up there.</p>
        <p>But he was also moved by ideas, and was a committed free trader and New Dealer who believed that, as he said, ''nothing cures poverty like money.'' He married a strong woman, a fellow lawyer, Pauline LaFon, and spent much of his career defending unpopular stands, like his opposition to American involvement in Vietnam and his refusal to sign Senator Strom Thurmond's Southern Manifesto, which encouraged Southerners to defy court decisions on desegregation. (He did, however, vote against the Civil Rights Act in 1964 -- an election year for him -- and wrote in his memoirs that that vote was an enduring regret.)</p>
        <p>He felt no Southerner had a real chance at his party's presidential nomination but hoped to serve as vice president, and he campaigned hard, against Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts and a fellow Tennessean, Senator Estes Kefauver, in an effort to become Adlai Stevenson's running mate in 1956. Mr. Kefauver won.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore was hopeful again in 1960, but Kennedy chose Lyndon B. Johnson. At Mr. Gore's funeral, his son joked about the senator's longtime longing for the No. 2  job: ''Now that's humility.''</p>
