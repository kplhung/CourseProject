        <p>He threw the basketball toward the rafters, a long heave that ended another heirloom of a game and left Chris Childs defiantly shaking his head. Standing there today as his Knicks teammates stormed the middle of American Airlines Arena and hugged and laughed and lifted one another off the floor, the little instigator had again caused a big ruckus.</p>
        <p>Hadn't the Miami Heat learned anything from this surreal seven-game odyssey? Whether it was Anthony Carter dropping in an impossible shot over the backboard in Game 2 or Bruce Bowen calmly downing a 3-pointer to seal Game 5, it became understood.</p>
        <p>Do not leave players who took the long road to the National Basketball Association open. You cannot give them the lane to drive, an inch behind the arc or two free throws in the final minutes. They worked too hard to get here.</p>
        <p>''It's just that C.B.A. guys have unbelievable heart,'' Childs, a five-year veteran of the Continental Basketball Association, said after another demoralized Heat crowd had filed out into the Miami sunlight, cursing his existence. ''Nobody has seen the hotels we stay in, the money we make. What we had to do to even make the N.B.A. You can't really describe unless you live that life. We have a passion for the game nobody could understand.''</p>
        <p>Not a No. 1 draft pick whose bags have been carried to and from the team charter plane since he was 22. Not a most valuable player candidate with a $105 million deal. Only someone who played for Quad City would understand.</p>
        <p>Childs thought long about this after the game was over, this 83-82 thriller won by the irrepressible Knicks and their backup point guard. He scored 13 straight Knicks points, including 10 to begin the fourth quarter, keeping them in a game they were about to throw away.</p>
        <p>But when the offensive options dwindled to one, the most confident role player in America morphed into the Knicks' go-to guy, maneuvering his 6-foot-2-inch frame past Alonzo Mourning and the Miami front line, scoring on driving layups and drawing fouls, knocking down important jump shots.</p>
        <p>Fitting, no, that Childs helped end the madness? For all the nothing-to-lose loyalists who gave up their bodies for Miami Coach Pat Riley the past two weeks -- Bowen, Carter, Dan Majerle and Clarence Weatherspoon -- the Knicks finally countered with one of their own.</p>
        <p>Knicks-Heat has never been about ego, multimillionaires or petulant franchise players. It is about hard-core ball, gym rats and hoop junkies, trading shots like two youngsters in a pillow fight who can't seem to get the other one to go groggy and drop.</p>
        <p>''When you look at it, it was just 24 guys who suited up, willing to give everything they had,'' Kurt Thomas said.</p>
        <p>A speechless Knicks Coach Jeff Van Gundy, a lump welling in his throat after hearing that Riley wished for him to win a championship, offered this perspective: ''Take the basketball out of it. It's been an unbelievable four years of competition. It's draining, it's exhilarating, it's painful, it's all those things. But I'll remember it for the absolute courageous effort of both teams.''</p>
        <p>Courage is strong, but Childs's gumption, his coolness amid the calamity, sent the Knicks to Indiana and the conference finals for the second straight season as much as anything.</p>
        <p>You could not believe the decibel level in this building when Mourning blocked Allan Houston's driving runner with less than 10 minutes left. Miami had a 71-65 lead, and for the first time in two weeks it seemed that someone would end the dance, pull away from the other for good.</p>
        <p>The Heat had the ball and a chance to go up by 8 points. With bedlam a Mourning dunk away, Childs stole a Jamal Mashburn pass and raced upcourt. He bore down, went hard to his right and attacked the basket.</p>
        <p>He was not taking on Mourning and P. J. Brown and Weatherspoon as much as he was taking on the venom in the arena, the people who would die happy if his layup was rejected into the stands as he raced toward the rim.</p>
        <p>Bucket. And a foul on Weatherspoon. Three-point play. Three-point game.</p>
        <p>''One of the biggest plays of the game,'' Riley said. ''Chris drove down to our basket and got a 3-point play.''</p>
        <p>There is something about Childs that embodies these Knicks like no other player. The constant feuding with referees. The way he hip-checks everyone guarding him as he dribbles down the floor. The way he squared off against Kobe Bryant two months ago in Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>The little bully, unbent and unbowed, ready to trade genuine blows with every player who challenges him, cocksure enough to guarantee a Game 6 victory -- and back it up.</p>
        <p>For 9 minutes 12 seconds today, the people who are paid more than anyone else to fill Madison Square Garden and deliver the Knicks a championship either could not make a shot or were blanketed by their defenders.</p>
        <p>Patrick Ewing, Latrell Sprewell and Houston -- all current or past All-Stars -- were stifled by the suffocating Heat defense.</p>
        <p>Childs's run of 13 straight points began with a 3-pointer at the end of the third quarter and ended with two free throws with four minutes left. With the noise at a deafening pitch and Mourning about to decide the series defensively, Childs took on the Heat as well as Dade and Broward Counties.</p>
        <p>''Yo, Chili, you were strong,'' Larry Johnson said to Childs, affectionately calling him by his nickname in a jubilant postgame locker room.</p>
        <p>''Thanks, man,'' Childs said, slapping his hand.</p>
        <p>The unshakable Quad City kid, going back to the Eastern Conference finals, heaving the ball toward the rafters, leaving the hard road behind.</p>
