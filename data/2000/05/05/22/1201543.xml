        <p>FALLING stock prices are not the only numbers giving e-commerce executives heartburn these days. Equally unsettling to some Internet merchants is the flood of statistics suggesting that to keep their businesses growing, they have to look outside the United States.</p>

        <p>FALLING stock prices are not the only numbers giving e-commerce executives heartburn these days. Equally unsettling to some Internet merchants is the flood of statistics suggesting that to keep their businesses growing, they have to look outside the United States.</p>
        <p>A report to be released today by IDC, an Internet research firm, predicts that two-thirds of all e-commerce spending will take place outside the country by 2003. In that year, IDC says, consumer spending on Web sites in the United States will reach $119 billion, but overseas sites will garner $209 billion of business.</p>
        <p>And yet, with the investment community demanding that Web merchants find a speedier path to profitability, the merchants can hardly justify the expenses associated with rolling out sites aimed at other nations.</p>
        <p>Those expenses can be substantial. According to Eric Schmitt, an analyst with the Forrester Research consulting firm, retailers can spend ''a couple million dollars in the first year of international efforts.''</p>
        <p>''And this is a treadmill,'' he said. ''You don't just build the Spanish version and walk away. It's a beast that needs to be fed.''</p>
        <p>Just last week, Boo.com, a British fashion e-tailer, went out of business a mere six months after its public stock offering. Boo.com had quickly become insolvent -- in large part because of the strain of trying to start up in 18 different countries simultaneously.</p>
        <p>Barry Parr, author of the IDC report, said that even when e-commerce companies have the money to devote to overseas expansion, ''these markets can be very difficult to address.'' In addition to the obvious language hurdles, he said e-tailers faced regulatory challenges with import and export rules, taxation and technology issues, and wrinkles in each country's customer service and fulfillment approaches.</p>
        <p>Industry executives said that any of these items could, if mishandled, torpedo a company's international efforts. But fulfillment issues are particularly problematic. When the e-commerce trend took off two years ago, some analysts predicted that Web merchants would overturn traditional retailing, which tended to be based on customers who shop within 10 miles of their homes.</p>
        <p>Indeed, that revolutionary sentiment partly fueled investors' enthusiasm for companies like Amazon.com and CDNow, which quickly found customers throughout the world who were willing to shop on their sites. But the last year consumers and businesses have acknowledged that many customers prefer to do business with retailers that can serve them both on the Web and in a local store if they want to return items.</p>
        <p>At the very least, analysts said, consumers want to shop with an Internet retailer that can handle customer service problems and returns from the same continent.</p>
        <p>For Web merchants with global aspirations, that frequently means building and staffing customer service centers on different continents -- as Amazon did when it set up a phone center in the Netherlands this year -- as well as working with local distributors or manufacturers.</p>
        <p>Despite such a daunting list of investment and cultural challenges, Mr. Parr of IDC said globalization plans were imperative for Internet retailers.</p>
        <p>''I tell companies that before they leap into wireless initiatives, they should figure out their international strategy. It has to be part of the plan.''</p>
        <p>In devising that strategy, analysts say one crucial decision is how a company manages its foreign Web sites. On one hand, if a company chooses to manage the global operations from the United States, its foreign sites are far more prone to make linguistic and merchandising mistakes -- for instance, selling goods that might be offensive in certain cultures, or offering product instructions that are delivered with the wrong tone.</p>
        <p>''In Japan, you wouldn't say 'Don't turn the left knob,' because that's too direct,'' said Charles Baxter, chief executive of eTranslate, a consulting company. ''You'd say something like 'It would be much better to turn the right knob.' ''</p>
        <p>Such mistakes are less likely if companies hire a team in each foreign market to handle the Web site, analysts said. But that, too, can lead to problems for companies trying to convey a consistent brand message.</p>
        <p>''Customers can spot inconsistencies,'' Forrester's Mr. Schmitt said. ''If you have to deal in multiple countries, you don't want 10 sites with a different look and feel at every one, and companies don't want to have 10 different backend systems.''</p>
        <p>One of the earliest successes in e-commerce globalization was Dell Computer, which began selling on the Web in 1996 and now has sites aimed at 85 different countries and territories. According to Frank Muehleman, senior vice president of Dell's worldwide division, the company uses a decentralized approach with its international sites.</p>
        <p>Dell created a common technology platform for each of its global sites, including a template for ordering and product information, which ensures a consistent user experience across the sites. In addition several hundred specialists give advice and training to the local managers. ''Then we let the local team handle the rollout,'' Mr. Muehleman said.</p>
        <p>Just as important, Mr. Muehleman said, Dell built manufacturing plants in each of the regions it serves, including Brazil, Ireland, China and Malaysia. And because the company employs local customer service staff, he said, ''every time a customer picks up the phone, they're dealing with someone local.''</p>
        <p>The Internet companies that have been the most active on the global front are the so-called portals, like Yahoo, Alta Vista and Lycos -- last week Lycos agreed to be acquired by Terra Networks, the Internet arm of the Spanish telecommunications company Telefonica de Espana. The portals' expansion into other nations, while not easy, has been a relative snap compared with the travails of companies that must actually move goods across borders.</p>
        <p>And even e-commerce companies that do not sell goods on the Web, like financial firms, have encountered plenty of obstacles in other countries. When the online broker Schwab.com started a site for clients in Britain in 1998, for instance, many customers there balked at online trading because they were accustomed to exchanging paper stock certificates in each transaction. Chiefly because Schwab.com refused to give paper certificates to its online customers, the site generated just 15,000 new accounts between June 1998 and June 1999, according to Russ Shaw, senior vice president of marketing for Charles Schwab Europe.</p>
        <p>The site then offered 30 days of commission-free trading to new customers last summer, and generated nearly 30,000 new customers in about two months. For both the customers and Schwab, Mr. Shaw said, ''it's been an education process.''</p>
        <p>Analysts say that most e-commerce companies are reluctant to begin that process, given the already steep learning curve they have encountered in the domestic market. But some alternatives may emerge.</p>
        <p>American e-tailers, for example, could form partnerships with retailers in other nations that want e-commerce sites of their own but lack the expertise to build them. Mr. Parr, the IDC analyst, said that under such an approach, an American e-tailer could lend its technology, and perhaps its name, to a foreign counterpart, which in turn would offer its local distribution and customer service systems and expertise. The companies would then share the revenues.</p>
        <p>Martin McClanan, chief executive of Red Envelope, a gift site, said he had been approached several times with similar offers, but so far he had demurred. ''Our plan is to bring this business to scale in the U.S. first,'' he said. ''Then, when we can dedicate a 20-person team to another country, we'll do that.'' The company might consider global expansion plans after this holiday season, he added.</p>
        <p>''It's so easy to want to boil the ocean and do everything,'' he said. ''But in retail it's all about execution. And getting this business to profitability is still first and foremost.''</p>
        <p>E-COMMERCE REPORT  Correction:  May 23, 2000, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, the E-Commerce Report column of Business Day yesterday, about the rigors faced by Internet companies trying to expand globally, misstated the ownership of Boo.com, the British online retailer. The company, which announced last week that it was going out of business, is owned by its founders and private investors. It has not made a public stock offering.</p>
