        <p>Representative Rick A.

        <p>But less than 48 hours after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani withdrew from the race because of his prostate cancer, Mr. Lazio had already accomplished two things the mayor had never done: he had officially announced his candidacy, and he had embarked on an extensive, multi-city upstate tour with his wife and two young daughters that is to take him to Elmira, Watertown, Utica, Albany and Westchester County on Monday.</p>

        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio raced through the first half of a two-day Senate campaign fly-around today, scrambling to present himself to voters here and in Rochester, Syracuse and Binghamton as a viable statewide alternative to his richly funded and well-traveled opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton.</p>
        <p>But less than 48 hours after Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani withdrew from the race because of his prostate cancer, Mr. Lazio had already accomplished two things the mayor had never done: he had officially announced his candidacy, and he had embarked on an extensive, multi-city upstate tour with his wife and two young daughters that is to take him to Elmira, Watertown, Utica, Albany and Westchester County on Monday.</p>
        <p>The Lazio family stayed overnight in the Holiday Inn in Elmira. In his infrequent trips upstate this year, Mr. Giuliani always returned in the evening to New York City.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to be here so often, I'm going to be sweating Buffalo wings,'' Mr. Lazio told a modest but lustily cheering crowd in a terminal of the Buffalo International Airport. Moments before, he had stepped off a seven-seat, two-engine jet that was hastily chartered for the trip. ''This campaign has been a 40-hour miracle,'' said Mr. Lazio's freshly hired political consultant, Mike Murphy, who three months ago was advising Senator John McCain on the ''Straight Talk Express.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio then introduced his wife, Patricia, and daughters Molly Ann, 7, and Kelsey, 6, to the crowd. ''We're here because we're a family operation, because we believe in family values,'' Mr. Lazio said. It was a pointed contrast to Mr. Giuliani, who never once campaigned in this race with his family and who announced this month that he had a ''very good'' female friend and was seeking a separation from his wife, Donna Hanover.</p>
        <p>At every stop, Mr. Lazio presented himself as the wholesome, earnest, fresh-faced stand-in, without the irritability of the old Giuliani or the philosophical soul-searching of the new. What he lacked in star quality or moody complexity, he made up for in energy. Even before he began his four-city upstate swing about noon, Mr. Lazio gave a commencement speech on Long Island and interviews to six morning news programs in New York City.</p>
        <p>On NBC's ''Meet the Press,'' Mr. Lazio said he would accept the Independence Party endorsement, even if Patrick J. Buchanan was at the top of the ticket. Both Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Giuliani, at varying times, have called Mr. Buchanan anti-Semitic and divisive.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's first upstate stop was Buffalo, where he was happily greeted by the same party leaders who only three weeks ago had rallied around Mr. Giuliani on his first upstate trip since announcing he had prostate cancer. For anyone who had been to both events, the sudden change in candidates was disorienting, like watching a play where the lead had been switched. But the overriding reaction of party leaders, who had agonized while the mayor agonized, was relief.</p>
        <p>''As every day went by and there was no decision, I thought he was staying in,'' Robert E. Davis, the Erie County Republican chairman, said of Mr. Giuliani. ''I'm glad it's over; I'm glad that the decision was made.'' Although Mr. Lazio is a virtual unknown outside his Suffolk County home base, Mr. Davis added, he is confident that that will change.</p>
        <p>''Within a couple of weeks, he's going to be pretty close to being a household name,'' Mr. Davis said.</p>
        <p>At each stop today, Mr. Lazio introduced himself to New Yorkers, without the aid of a Clintonesque biographical video, as ''the son of a guy who came back from World War II without a dime in his pocket.'' His parents' first date, he told the crowd, was at Ebbets Field, and his father built a business from scratch by borrowing $700. Over and over, Mr. Lazio described himself as a home-grown boy, the kind who ''never needed an exploratory committee to find western New York.''</p>
        <p>But as his last-minute tour made clear, Mr. Lazio faces enormous challenges upstate -- territory that traditionally should be his against a Democrat, but where Mrs. Clinton was recently running even with Mr. Giuliani in several polls. For nearly a year, Mrs. Clinton has campaigned extensively upstate, and seems to genuinely like it here. Recently she proudly told reporters accompanying her one early morning to see a waterfall in Wyoming County, ''You travel with me, and you see New York.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton also has $9 million in the bank compared with Mr. Lazio's $3.5 million. One big question is whether he will be able to harvest campaign contributions as prodigiously as Mr. Giuliani; the mayor's advisers say his campaign was grossing $1 million a week before he announced he had prostate cancer. (After the announcement, the advisers say, the gross weekly contributions were $600,000 to $750,000.)</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said repeatedly today that he was up to the challenge. ''I know this is not just going to come to me,'' he told the crowd in Buffalo. ''I know I have to earn it.''</p>
        <p>At each stop, Mr. Lazio presented himself as a moderate, despite his alliance with Newt Gingrich, the former speaker of the House. He said that he favored abortion rights but was against a form of late-term abortion that opponents call ''partial birth.'' He also said he favors ''reasonable measures to support the rights of sportsmen,'' meaning that he was against gun registration.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio also frequently attacked Mrs. Clinton, echoing the language of his speech announcing his candidacy on Saturday. He said that she is ''on the far-left wing of the Democratic Party,'' that she is ''no more a New Democrat than she is a New Yorker'' and that ''I can't call on Air Force One whenever I need a ride.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton responded that ''I was little disappointed yesterday that my latest opponent has already started hurling insults instead of what we can do to improve the lives of New Yorkers.'' Howard Wolfson, Mrs. Clinton's press secretary, added that ''it sounds like the Rick Lazio statewide insult tour, day two.''</p>
        <p>Neither Gov. George E. Pataki nor the state Republican Party chairman, William D. Powers, accompanied Mr. Lazio across the state today, but Mr. Lazio did take a call from the governor during his stop in Buffalo. As a practical matter, there was no room on the plane. Mr. Lazio and his family took up four seats, Mr. Murphy took a fifth, and a press aide and a staff aide took up the remaining two.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murphy said that the campaign's biggest short-term challenge is ''mechanically, we're just trying to deal with the explosive growth of the campaign.'' He added that Mr. Lazio ''knows he's the underdog, he knows he's going to be outspent, he knows he's going to be behind for a while.''</p>
        <p>Joel A. Giambra, the Erie County executive, said that he is excited about Mr. Lazio, and that even though the candidate does not have the ''star quality'' of Mr. Giuliani, he is the person ''who can take on the 800-pound gorilla.''</p>
