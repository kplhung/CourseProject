        <p>YESTERDAY was the final day in a battle of cliches. Pat Riley, emperor and coach of the Miami Heat, exhorted his team with ''once and for all.'' After being eliminated by these Knicks the previous two seasons, Miami could break this spell once and for all. Jeff Van Gundy, the Knicks' coaching prince-in-waiting, had challenged his team to get to the ''ultimate game,'' Game 7. And once in the ultimate game, find a way to win it.</p>
        <p>Once and for all. The ultimate game. Somehow in the alchemy of great competition, the teams came close to achieving their goals: the Knicks got to their ultimate game; Miami very nearly exorcised that New York ghost. In the end, Miami lost, 83-82, and its season was over.</p>
        <p>The Knicks' victory was so enthralling that even the normally pessimistic Van Gundy could not hide his satisfaction. ''I am so proud of what this team has accomplished,'' he said. ''To come in here and win three times is something special.''</p>
        <p>This was Van Gundy's ultimate game; in a basketball sense, it was Riley's most disastrous hour.</p>
        <p>''This is tough to take,'' Riley said. ''This is a familiar feeling; I didn't think it would happen again.''</p>
        <p>From start to finish in these Eastern Conference semifinals, each game was like a civil war for the two teams that are part of the same basketball nation: Riley, the former coach of the Knicks who pulled the franchise from the ashes and then left in an ugly dispute; Van Gundy, who was once Riley's assistant and took over, building a team in Riley's general image. Riley even has Van Gundy's younger brother, Stan, on his bench.</p>
        <p>After yesterday's loss, Riley appeared with face reddened and eyes downcast, though Miami brought this on itself. On Friday the Heat squandered an 18-point lead and lost. The Game 7 defeat yesterday was a slow roast.</p>
        <p>The Heat started so strongly, with Alonzo Mourning dominating and Tim Hardaway showing flashes of his old brilliance.</p>
        <p>But this game had such rapidly changing currents. The Heat led by 9 points at the end of the first quarter; by intermission Latrell Sprewell had caught fire and ignited a push that gave the Knicks the lead. The currents continued to change until Miami was knocked out of the playoffs by the Knicks for the third consecutive year.</p>
        <p>Van Gundy was as compassionate as an opponent could be without conceding the game. ''I feel for them,'' he said. ''I want to win, but I feel for them.''</p>
        <p>Van Gundy challenged his team the last two weeks as he watched the Knicks get pushed around, outhustled, beaten, it seemed, to every loose ball. The Heat and Knicks went about this second-round series in peekaboo fashion: lose a game, win a game; lose a game, win a game; lose a game, win a game.</p>
        <p>On Friday he challenged the Knicks to have the guts to play for the ultimate game, Game 7. They did, and yesterday the Knicks pulled off a harrowing victory. Sprewell surged in the second quarter and Chris Childs in the fourth, and Patrick Ewing, playing his second dominating game in less than 48 hours, floored the Heat with a crushing dunk. He was the exclamation point on a whip-around series of passes that went from Childs to Sprewell to Larry Johnson to Ewing, who caught, stepped and dunked the Heat out of the playoffs.</p>
        <p>All the loose balls the Knicks lost, they got; the rebounds that got away, they grabbed. Where before they had unwittingly fallen into the Heat's defensive trap, yesterday the Knicks attacked.</p>
        <p>Someone said this was the greatest early-round series of all time. Who knows? Better than those knockdown, drag-out series with Baltimore in 1970 when the Knicks won, 4-3? Better than the 1971 series with Baltimore that they lost, 4-3?</p>
        <p>All Pat Riley knew was that this was the best one he had been involved with, and he has been a coach and a player in the National Basketball Association for almost 30 years.</p>
        <p>''I've been in 13 world championship finals and I've never been part of a finals that's had as much intensity and as much effort, as much caring, as much everything as something prior to getting to the finals,'' he said. ''You have to understand that this was a very unique matchup. One team just ran out of clock.''</p>
        <p>Riley complained that the game had been determined by the officials.</p>
        <p>''I've never been part of a game when officials were deciding games on perimeter fouls,'' he said. ''It's hard for a team to take. It just is.'' He said they were not shooting fouls, ''just touch fouls and bailout fouls.''</p>
        <p>It's difficult, Riley said, ''for a team that has worked hard to lose that way.''</p>
        <p>''I'd rather lose on what happened with Patrick with a blatant dunk,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But the Heat made just 11 of 21 foul shots; the Knicks were 28 of 31. ''You got to step up and knock those down,'' Riley conceded.</p>
        <p>A third knockout loss to the Knicks made it that much worse. ''There's not much more we can learn from it,'' Riley said, ''because we've been here already a couple of times.''</p>
        <p>The future is just beginning for Van Gundy. Last year he had a team with a makeup that was not necessarily to his liking, in a truncated season, but nevertheless reached the N.B.A. finals. This team, this style is Van Gundy's from start to finish.</p>
        <p>Now for all the pregame talk about reaching Game 7, the Knicks have to forget this game and move on to Indiana. For one day, however, the Knicks made Van Gundy smile. They had not only reached the ultimate game, they had won it.</p>
