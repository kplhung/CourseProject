        <p>Paul Rigdon has been a big-league pitcher for one day and he can tell friends he gets standing ovations every other inning. He can say those world champion Yankees aren't that tough if you just throw strikes. He can say he outduels pitchers like Orlando Hernandez.</p>
        <p>Rigdon can say his record is perfect, after he allowed just two hits in pitching shutout ball for seven innings today, as Cleveland dumped the Yankees, 6-1. The Yankees' only run came in the ninth; they have not scored a run with Hernandez (4-4) in the game since May 3, a span of 24 innings.</p>
        <p>The Yankees lost two of three games to Cleveland this weekend. It was the first time they dropped a series at Jacobs Field since June 20-22, 1997, when the Indians also took two of three games. Because Boston lost two of three to Detroit, the Yankees (24-16) did not lose any ground in the American League East: they are one game behind the Red Sox (25-15).</p>
        <p>Rigdon, 24, was promoted to the majors in the wake of the rash of devastating pitching injuries suffered by the Indians last week. In one day Cleveland placed three pitchers -- the starters Jaret Wright and Charles Nagy and the reliever Ricardo Rincon -- on the disabled list. All the Yankees knew about Rigdon before he pitched today was contained in a few lines of a scouting report. He throw sinkers, it was written, and sliders, and he throws lots of strikes.</p>
        <p>Bernie Williams said later that the report did not mention the changeup that Rigdon threw. Nor did it mention that Rigdon blew out his elbow in 1996 and had to have the joint rebuilt, or that he missed the entire 1997 season, or that he was among the first players cut in spring training.</p>
        <p>The Yankees learned about Rigdon mostly by watching him pitch today. They could see he was a tall right-hander, and aggressive. He was nervous facing the Yankees, he said afterward, so he just pretended he was not facing the Yankees, but just an ordinary team.</p>
        <p>He just kept pumping strikes, ''kept getting ahead in the count,'' Manager Joe Torre said. ''He wasn't overpowering, obviously.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees kept getting healthy swings against Rigdon, putting the ball in play, but Chuck Knoblauch did not collect the Yankees' first hit until there were two out in the third inning. After Rigdon retired the side in the top of the fourth, striking out Jorge Posada to close the inning, fans at Jacobs Field -- accustomed to seeing the Yankees destroy Cleveland pitching -- gave the rookie a standing ovation. They stood again for him after the fifth and sixth innings. ''When there are 40,000 on their feet cheering for you,'' Rigdon said, ''it sends chills down your spine.''</p>
        <p>Cleveland (23-17) scored in each of the first three innings, building a 4-0 lead with rallies that included an inside-the-park home run. Two outs into the second inning, Enrique Wilson lifted a high drive toward right field. Paul O'Neill retreated, staring upward. O'Neill felt the hard rubber surface of the warning track beneath his feet, and as he continued to follow the flight of the ball, he anticipated he would reach the fence.</p>
        <p>O'Neill did not know he had drifted into the jaws of an angle, where one part of the wall meets another and creates a little extra space on the warning track. O'Neill was not as close to the wall as he thought. Rather than back up another step or two, he jumped, falling backward, and the ball glanced off his glove, ricocheted off the fence and bounded toward the infield. O'Neill lay against the base of the wall, helpless.</p>
        <p>As Williams ran over from center field to retrieve the ball, Wilson charged around the bases, waved around third by the base coach Jim Riggleman. It appeared the second baseman, Knoblauch, the relay man, had a reasonable chance of cutting down Wilson at the plate, but his throw sailed high over the catcher Posada's head while Wilson belly-flopped across the plate, exhausted.</p>
        <p>''I just got kind of lost and I missed it,'' O'Neill said. ''It got in the sun and I lost it. But it hit my glove, and any time it hits your glove, you should catch it.''</p>
        <p>Hernandez had his hands on his hips frequently, his pose of frustration, and after Jim Thome ripped a high curveball for a two-run homer in the third, Hernandez looked at Posada and tapped himself on the chest: my fault. Manny Ramirez's two-run homer in the seventh finished the scoring against Hernandez, who allowed nine hits, three walks and six runs in six-plus innings.</p>
        <p>Posada lined a one-out double off Rigdon in the seventh and the Indians' bullpen came to life, as if the Indians could not believe how much they were getting out of Rigdon. But Jim Leyritz smashed a grounder that shortstop Omar Vizquel gloved to begin an inning-ending double play -- the second of three Cleveland double plays -- and fans were on their feet again. Later, Knoblauch and Scott Brosius estimated that they have received two standing ovations at Yankee Stadium; Rigdon had four on his first day.</p>
        <p>The Yankees scored an unearned run in the ninth before Posada flied out to end the game.</p>
        <p>Tino Martinez flipped his batting gloves onto the dugout and other Yankees tossed balls and other items as if to rid themselves of mementos from this frustrating day against a rookie pitcher they could not hit.</p>
