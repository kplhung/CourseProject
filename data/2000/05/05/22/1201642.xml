        <p>A man and a woman died yesterday after their car crashed through a fence and sank in the Passaic River, the police said.</p>
        <p>The victims, John Smith, 86, and his wife, Catherine, 84, were driving in a parking lot used by several stores on Passaic Avenue about 4:45 p.m. when the driver appeared to lose control, witnesses told the police.</p>
        <p>Officers called to the scene stripped off their guns and hats and jumped in the murky river, but the car sank, said Sgt. Thomas Osborne of the Kearny police.</p>
        <p>Scuba divers from the Lyndhurst Fire Department eventually pulled the victims out, but Mr. Smith died at West Hudson Hospital in Kearny and Mrs. Smith at St. Michael's Hospital in Newark, Sergeant Osborne said.</p>
        <p>Several officers and firefighters were treated for exposure.</p>
