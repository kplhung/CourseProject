        <p>D J R Brucker reviews Marathon 2000-Series B, 23d annual festival of new one-act plays presented by Ensemble Studio Theater: Accident by Peter Maloney, directed by Beatrice Terry; 17th of June by Edward Allan Baker, directed by Jamie Richards; The Rothko Room by Stuart Spencer, directed by John Ruocco, and Lives of the Saints by David Ives, directed by John Rando; photos (M)</p>

        <p>If there is a shared theme in the four one-acts of Series B of the Ensemble Studio Theater's Marathon 2000, it appears to be spiritualism for rock-ribbed materialists; there may be something out there, but don't let it get to you.</p>
        <p>In the first of two serious plays a dead man compels four survivors to sheathe knives they had drawn to carve up his reputation, and in the second what might be an apparition emerges from, of all things, a suite of Mark Rothko paintings. Familiar spirits hover over the heads of a pair of ridiculously pious women in an improbably funny variation on old offensive Polish jokes in one comic work, and in another a man who suspects his doctors are conspiring with a gray ghost to kill him snares death in a trap -- producing, incidentally, the only old-fashioned ectoplasmic effect in the entire quartet of performances.</p>

        <p>If there is a shared theme in the four one-acts of Series B of the Ensemble Studio Theater's Marathon 2000, it appears to be spiritualism for rock-ribbed materialists; there may be something out there, but don't let it get to you.</p>
        <p>In the first of two serious plays a dead man compels four survivors to sheathe knives they had drawn to carve up his reputation, and in the second what might be an apparition emerges from, of all things, a suite of Mark Rothko paintings. Familiar spirits hover over the heads of a pair of ridiculously pious women in an improbably funny variation on old offensive Polish jokes in one comic work, and in another a man who suspects his doctors are conspiring with a gray ghost to kill him snares death in a trap -- producing, incidentally, the only old-fashioned ectoplasmic effect in the entire quartet of performances.</p>
        <p>The most polished piece is ''Lives of the Saints'' by David Ives, in which two women prepare a breakfast for family members after a funeral in the basement of a Roman Catholic church in a Polish-American neighborhood. Saints dance through the conversation and spring up on kitchen utensils, place mats, napkins (''There used to be potholders with St. Damien and the lepers,'' says one woman searching drawers; ''Yes,'' says the other, ''and I don't know what's happened to those lepers lately'') -- and doves descend on the pair as they swap vows to prepare funeral breakfasts for one another when the end comes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ives's dialogue skims perilously close to ethnic insult often enough to keep the audience on edge. But the two women created by Nancy Opel and Anne O'Sullivan are so comically lovable that nothing they say could be annoying, and Ms. O'Sullivan's laugh can stop the show when she's not saying anything.</p>
        <p>And then there are the sound-effects men: Sean Sutherland and Chris Wight. The church basement is an empty stage, but as the women whip up the meal the sounds of crockery, cutlery, egg beaters, mixers and refrigerator and oven doors fill the auditorium. Midway through the 20-minute sketch a hand draws open a curtain, disclosing the sound men manipulating instruments they might have found in a Dumpster, with the solemn faces of prelates at the altar.</p>
        <p>The few viewers old enough to have been in an audience for comic radio programs more than half a century ago will get a fine nostalgic kick from this, and the others will realize that the hilarity on tapes of the classic comedy hours came less from the antics of actors than from those of the producers of whacks, thuds, crashes and snaps.</p>
        <p>The sound men here have the synchronized precision of musicians, and John Rando's direction has the energy and rhythm of a folk dance. The moment that brings down the house has one woman spritzing frosting into swirls on a cake and the other springing Jell-O from molds to shwooshes and clicks from Mr. Sutherland and Mr. Wight that echo the melody of ''Beer Barrel Polka'' in three-quarter time.</p>
        <p>In ''Accident,'' Peter Maloney, who wrote the comedy, plays himself and his son, Griffith Maloney, is a sleek shadow on in-line skates. The two were skating in Central Park, we are told, when the father's wheels tangled with acorns piled up by a squirrel, and he took a spill that shattered his shoulder. For half an hour he rushes us through a fright house of medical misconduct, all the while reflecting on his bewildering offspring in terms of the Oedipus story, praying to the Egyptian god Osiris manifested in a spectacularly amusing sun, and worrying that the shadow tracking his every move is really the old man with the scythe come to whisk him away.</p>
        <p>The senior Mr. Maloney has proved in scores of plays at the Ensemble Studio that he can inhabit any character imaginable, and this audience, which knows him well, seems to soak up his exhausting performance right down to the last moment he stuffs a plastic skeleton into a black bag, backs away from it and exults, ''I've got death in that bag now.'' Ah, but then it moves, all on its own.</p>
        <p>''The Rothko Room'' by Stuart Spencer extends this playwright's fascination with art and sculpture by bringing a woman (Christine Farrell) and a man (Dashiell Eaves) into an exhibition of Rothko canvases originally meant to be a mural. As they try to penetrate meanings hidden in pictures they see as ''flickering,'' the secrets they uncover are in themselves, not in the art.</p>
        <p>In 15 minutes a personal history of the two emerges, the climax of which is wholly unsuspected until the last few lines. While the writing is clever, the story is not profound. The performance does make a deep impression on the audience, however, thanks to the air of enchantment created by the actors and, most important, by John Ruocco, the director, whose considerable experience as a choreographer, especially in staging children's stories, is put to superb use in this strange, unsettling fantasy.</p>
        <p>The longest play here -- 35 minutes -- is ''The 17th of June'' by Edward Allan Baker, still another of his explorations of spousal abuse in a series of works extending back at least a dozen years. A battered woman (Fiona Gallagher) desperately grieves for her husband, who died while she and a neighbor (Joseph Lyle Taylor), with whom she had taken refuge after her husband beat her, spent a weekend at a casino resort. Her sisters (Geneva Carr and Ellen Mareneck) try humor, needling and even scorn to make her find relief in the death of her tormentor, but she remains fiercely loyal.</p>
        <p>As their arguments proceed, it turns out that the husband had not only helped the sisters out of serious difficulties but had also grown increasingly despondent over his abuse of his wife and had committed a suicide so bizarre that it would never have been recognized as one if he had not told the neighbor what he meant to do.</p>
        <p>The story is unbelievable, but that may not matter. Mr. Baker and these actors, under the direction of Jamie Richards, pull the audience through such a complete turn of emotions that there is palpable relief when the lights go down, and a well-deserved ovation for performers who can create out of such transparent material an illusion so solid it feels threatening to the viewer.</p>
        <p>Series B continues through Sunday, and the last series runs from May 31 through June 11.</p>
