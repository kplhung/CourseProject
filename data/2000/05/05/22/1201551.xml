        <p>Vodafone AirTouch P.L.C., the world's largest wireless telephone operator, is considering selling the fixed-line assets it acquired when it bought Mannesmann A.G. and speeding up the sale of Orange P.L.C., Britain's third-largest cellular operator, to raise more than $60 billion, executives close to the company said tonight.</p>
        <p>The company is considering selling Mannesmann's stake in its Mannesmann Arcor unit and in Infostrada S.p.A. of Italy, the executives said. Vodafone is hoping those assets will raise at least $:15 billion, or $22 billion, the executives said. Vodafone is also hoping to sell Orange, which it has to shed in about a month to satisfy regulators as part of its acquisition of Mannesmann. Vodafone had initially planned to spin off Orange and sell shares to the public, but it recently reversed course, holding talks with several suitors about a possible sale.</p>
        <p>According to executives close to the talks, France Telecom is the front-runner to acquire the company for more than $:25 billion, or $37 billion. Telefonica of Spain has also expressed interest in Orange and is being considered along with a joint bid from Royal KPN of the Netherlands and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone's DoCoMo of Japan, which recently took a stake in KPN Mobile.</p>
        <p>Orange's management is furious that Vodafone is planning a sale rather than spinning off the company, according to several executives, which will keep Orange from negotiating its own sale. According to an executive close to Orange, the company is worried that Vodafone will sell it to a company that will eventually make it less competitive with its current parent.</p>
        <p>Vodafone initially balked at selling Orange directly to another company because of the tax implications, but according to the executives, it has devised a method to sell the company with a smaller tax liability.</p>
        <p>The recent spate of high-priced auctions across Europe for so-called third-generation wireless licenses has caused Vodafone to rethink its strategy, the executives said. Vodafone recently paid $9.42 billion for a third-generation license in Britain and is competing for similar licenses across the Continent. Shares of Vodafone have also fallen since its $183 billion acquisition of Mannesmann, slumping to $:2.425 on Friday from $:3.855 at the time of the deal.</p>
        <p>If Vodafone does sell some of Mannesmann's fixed-line operations, the move would be a departure from Vodafone's previous pledge to keep the business intact.</p>
        <p>Vodafone has recently been on a selling spree. Just last week it said it would sell its entire stake in Cegetel, the French telephone company, to its partner Vivendi. Vodafone had earlier said it would sell 7.5 percent of Mannesmann's stake in Cegetel, but it decided to sell the entire stake -- 15 percent -- to raise more cash. Vodafone also sold Mannesmann's engineering and automotive unit, Atecs, for 9.6 billion euros, or $8.6 billion, to Siemens A.G. and Robert Bosch G.m.b.H. in April.</p>
        <p>Vodafone is advised by Goldman, Sachs.</p>
