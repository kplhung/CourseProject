        <p>Up on the roof of the Washington hotel where he grew up, the old Fairfax, now a much tonier Westin, Vice President Al Gore was standing at the edge. There is no railing on the roof of the eight-story building and Mr. Gore was trying to goad a reporter into following him there. ''I'd catch you,'' he said, and he seemed amazed that anyone would decline such a sporting challenge.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore had taken a reporter and photographer back to his former home on Massachusetts Avenue, and while the return visit did not seem particularly emotional -- no Barbara Walters moments, certainly -- it did bring back memories of how cranky old Senator John McClellan of Arkansas would get, in the suite below the Gores, when Al Gore dribbled his basketball.</p>

        <p>Up on the roof of the Washington hotel where he grew up, the old Fairfax, now a much tonier Westin, Vice President Al Gore was standing at the edge. There is no railing on the roof of the eight-story building and Mr. Gore was trying to goad a reporter into following him there. ''I'd catch you,'' he said, and he seemed amazed that anyone would decline such a sporting challenge.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore had taken a reporter and photographer back to his former home on Massachusetts Avenue, and while the return visit did not seem particularly emotional -- no Barbara Walters moments, certainly -- it did bring back memories of how cranky old Senator John McClellan of Arkansas would get, in the suite below the Gores, when Al Gore dribbled his basketball.</p>
        <p>Inside the building, Mr. Gore gestured toward a door. ''This woman down here had great Jell-O, so I'd go down and visit with her,'' he said, as if he were half-hoping that she might still come out and invite him in.</p>
        <p>The Gores' two-bedroom apartment has been totally rebuilt, but the view from the roof is still mostly unaltered. ''This was a key escape route,'' he said, taking the stairs up into the open air. And on the roof, he was reminded of some of the childish tricks he used to spend hours there perfecting.</p>
        <p>''I'd lay on my belly on the edge'' and lower a toy duck, tied to a thread, down slowly, trying to bop those walking into the hotel on the head just as they went through the door, he said. He also hurled water balloons at cars stopped at the red light below, and ''I hate to admit this,'' he said, ''but I would scare the birds up here, with distressing results for the windshields'' of cars on the street.</p>
        <p>Coming back down the stairs, he spied a small indentation in the wall where he used to hide ''whatever a 10-year-old didn't want someone to find.''</p>
        <p>''Some of my stuff may still be in there,'' he said. But no, it had been sealed off and painted over.</p>
