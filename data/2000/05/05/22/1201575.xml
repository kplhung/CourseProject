        <p>A day after Beijing hinted at new flexibility in dealing with Taiwan and its new president, it hastened to restate that its ''one China'' principle was an absolute precondition of strengthening ties.</p>
        <p>''Acceptance or rejection of the one-China principle is the touchstone to test whether one sincerely wants to improve cross-straits relations,'' said a commentary by the official New China News Agency, issued in response to the inaugural speech on Saturday by President Chen Shui-bian of Taiwan.</p>
        <p>''Anybody who dares insist on splitting Taiwan from China,'' the press agency said, ''must bear responsibility for all the serious consequences.''</p>
        <p>In his speech on Saturday, Mr. Chen tried to reassure Beijing that he wanted reconciliation, but he did not satisfy the Chinese leaders' demand that he unequivocally call Taiwan a part of China.</p>
        <p>In an official response on Saturday that was largely repeated in today's article, Beijing accused Mr. Chen of insincerity and evasiveness. But the statement also emphasized China's desire to seek closer economic ties across the Taiwan Strait.</p>
        <p>And, for the first time since Mr. Chen's election in March, Beijing said negotiations could start under two conditions: if both sides ''express in their own way orally'' that they adhere to the one-China principle, as China says both did in 1992, and if Taiwan does not call itself an equal state.</p>
        <p>Today, in his second day as president, Mr. Chen offered a potential plum if the two sides can start talking. He said he hoped to negotiate an end to what he called Taiwan's outdated ban on direct trade, shipping and postal links.</p>
        <p>Beijing has long sought such direct ties, known as the ''three links,'' not just to save the cost of sending goods and flights via Hong Kong but as a way to draw Taiwan to the mainland.</p>
        <p>Taiwan, professing security concerns, has kept the ban as a bargaining chip, but its own business leaders, who have invested billions in China and send it a huge amount of exports, are increasingly chafing at the costs.</p>
        <p>Political experts in China and Taiwan said the varying statements during the last two days were predictable as the sides continued to test each other as Mr. Chen assumed power. In particular, Beijing is probing to see how far Mr. Chen has moved from his longtime advocacy of formal independence for Taiwan.</p>
        <p>''I think Chen Shui-bian's speech offered something positive, and we should catch the opportunity,'' said a Chinese specialist in foreign policy, Shen Dingli of Fudan University in Shanghai. ''But Beijing will continue to put pressure on him over 'one China' to keep him moving in the right direction.'' When he was preparing to run for president, Mr. Chen stopped calling for formal independence, though he emphasized that Taiwan was already sovereign in practice and intended to stay that way.</p>
        <p>China's statement today, compared with Saturday's, included more emphatic reminders that the one-China principle was a non-negotiable precondition for talks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chen described his goal of relaxing commercial restrictions today as he visited the outlying Taiwan-controlled island of Jinmen, or Quemoy, which is near the mainland and would greatly benefit from direct commerce.</p>
        <p>''Under the precondition that national security can be assured,'' Mr. Chen said, ''we are willing to review the outdated, rigid and inflexible three-links policy.''</p>
        <p>He said the admission of China and Taiwan to the World Trade Organization, which could happen as early as September, would provide a natural forum for discussing such impediments to direct trade.</p>
        <p>Julian Kuo, a political scientist at Soochow University in Taipei and an adviser to Taiwan's Foreign Ministry, said it was ''a good sign'' that Beijing had mentioned reviving the 1992 political formula and its desire to strengthen economic ties.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kuo warned that rapid progress was unlikely, especially before China's leaders make crucial decisions about Taiwan at their annual seaside retreat in August.</p>
        <p>But he also said that membership of China and Taiwan in the trade organization could provide an opportunity to ''sort out economic issues'' and end the ban on direct commerce. China and other countries have agreed in principle that Taiwan can join the trade group on a special, non-state basis.</p>
