        <p>Overcoming fears of violence, Haitians crowded into chaotic polling places today to elect thousands of legislators and local officials with the hope that their country would finally escape its political paralysis of the last three years.</p>
        <p>The vote had been postponed three times since its original November date because of political fights and logistical setbacks. Voters initially encountered confusion and long lines today when they tried to cast ballots.</p>
        <p>Polls opened late in many places as officials scrambled to deliver ballots or voter lists. Nonetheless, there was a widespread expectation that perhaps Haiti had a chance to have a fully functioning democracy and recover from its turbulent past and impoverished present.</p>
        <p>''These elections are important because this is the only weapon the people can use to struggle against all that is bad,'' said Jean-Claude Augustin, a candidate for mayor in Petionville, a Port-au-Prince suburb.  ''This is our chance to vote for the people who can do something for the country.''</p>
        <p>Accomplishing that in a country where decades of dictatorship under the Duvalier family and a succession of military juntas has been the norm proved trying today. Postponements and delays, combined with 15 politically related killings in the last six weeks, had generated a climate of insecurity and fears that voter turnout would be low.</p>
        <p>Instead, the streets were calm and bustling with people early today, and turnout was estimated at more than 50 percent of the four million registered voters. More than 29,000 candidates were vying for 7,500 posts from senators and deputies to mayors and local delegates. Final results were not expected until later in the week. Civic leaders were buoyed by the turnout because the current political stalemate stemmed from disputes over the validity of the last legislative elections in 1997, when only 5 percent of the electorate voted.</p>
        <p>Voters said they went to the polls because the country had no other option if Haiti ever hoped for the international community to recognize it as having a legitimate government and finally have access to $500 million in foreign aid that had gone untouched because the government was in a political standoff. Since last January, the country has had no constitutionally appointed prime minister and no Parliament. Its fortunes have steadily worsened with crumbling roads, insufficient police and increased crime. Drug trafficking has soared, making Haiti a major transshipment point for drugs headed to the United States.</p>
        <p>''I want a change,'' said Venel Esteve, as he waited to vote. ''I want people to have a life where they can put their children in school and put food on the table.''</p>
        <p>The possibility of emerging from the paralysis of recent years was enough to make some voters willing to confront even the worst memories of the past. Alexis Metalome waited to cast his vote at the Argentine Bellegarde National School, a place that had been a bloody memory since November 1987 when thugs linked to the military massacred more than 30 people trying to vote in the first post-Duvalier elections.</p>
        <p>''People are not afraid to vote today,'' said Mr. Metalome, who recalled how he fled the school in 1987 when he saw gunmen jump from two cars and start shooting. ''The violent people are now more afraid than we are. Nothing can stop the vote today.''</p>
        <p>But many things delayed it. Voters from the middle class suburb of Petionville to the teeming slums of Cite Soleil complained that they arrived at the polls at 6 a.m. only to wait for six hours or more because electoral officials showed up without ballots or voter lists. Tempers flared in Cite Soleil when voters could not find where they were supposed to vote.</p>
        <p>While there were few reports of violence, election monitors from the Organization of American States said tonight that they were concerned about reports of armed bands in some outlying parts of the country.</p>
        <p>Observers also said a local electoral official in Cite Soleil fled when intruders burst into a polling place, grabbed the ballots and marked them for the candidates of Family Lavalas, the party of former President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.</p>
        <p>The vote was seen as a crucial test for Mr. Aristide's power and popularity in anticipation of his run for the presidency in November. In the months before the election, roving bands of people claiming to be Lavalas supporters had violently forced  cancellation of a voter-education campaign. In April, those roving bands of ''chimeres'' burned down one party's headquarters while the police did nothing to stop them. The violence ebbed in recent weeks but created a climate of fear that sent some candidates into hiding.</p>
        <p>Political observers and civic leaders feared that Lavalas wanted to derail the elections, or at least wear down the opposition's patience and campaign funds to assure that their candidates would win. Some people suggested that the multiple delays in scheduling the vote were part of an attempt to combine the presidential and legislative elections so that Lavalas candidates could ride to victory on Mr. Aristide's coattails.</p>
        <p>''The one thing Aristide certainly does not want is to find himself with a parliament he could not control,'' said a diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.</p>
        <p>Lavalas officials insisted that they had been ready for elections all along. Mr. Aristide has also said that he wanted to make sure that calm prevailed during the elections. They accused their opponents of trying to tear them down because they cannot match Lavalas's popularity.</p>
        <p>Whatever the source, the fear as well as the numerous logistical glitches and delays took their toll on candidates who barely campaigned after running out of money.</p>
        <p>''Was there time enough for elections? Yes,'' said one businessman who was active in a civic coalition that urged candidates to resume campaigning. ''Was that time used properly? No.''</p>
        <p>Confusion and fatigue were evident among those Haitians who decided to sit it out altogether.</p>
        <p>''I do not have money or a job,'' said Gerard D'Liscard, as he fixed fishing nets on a rickety pier the day before the election. ''I'm not going. I voted before and nothing happened.''</p>
        <p>Others said they saw the problems leading up to the elections as an inevitable result of a country that is tottering toward democracy. ''All countries pass years and years before establishing a certain real democracy,'' said Raoul Denis, a businessman. ''It's a perpetual fight.''</p>
