        <p>Mae West, who would be 106 if alive, is staging an impressive comeback.</p>
        <p>''Dirty Blonde,'' a superb play by and starring Claudia Shear, brings her to life with such zesty insight that the Times critic cheered: ''Stand up, boys, and take your hats off. Mae West is back on Broadway.''</p>
        <p>She is the subject of other plays and articles recalling her battles against bluenoses. A new book about how women achieved power in Hollywood is titled ''Is That a Gun in Your Pocket?'' the first half of one of Miss West's memorable lines, which concluded with ''or are you just happy to see me?''</p>
        <p>Why is this subject fit for the Op-Ed page? Because I interviewed the real Mae West, boys, before she had a wrinkle on her face, and well remember the lesson she taught a cub reporter about living up to a legend.</p>
        <p>It was 1949; she was in her late 50's, starring on Broadway in ''Diamond Lil.'' Her leading man was not her film discovery Cary Grant, to whom she had famously vamped ''Come up and see me sometime,'' but the actor who also played ''Captain Video'' on small-screen TV.</p>
        <p>My boss at The New York Herald Tribune, the columnist Tex McCrary, thought it would be a kick to send a 19-year-old kid to interview the sex goddess. I was ushered into the ornate hotel suite by her maid, who I presume was named Beulah and could peel grapes.</p>
        <p>Miss West, from her reclining position on a chaise longue, looked up at me with an expression of ''Have I sunk to this? They're sending the office boy?'' Worse, my first question was painfully puerile: what was it like to play opposite the hero of thousands of kids, Captain Video?</p>
        <p>She thought about that. Then, coming to a decision, she changed her expression. Batting those long false eyelashes, she looked at the ceiling and murmured, ''Mmmm . . . suppose you ask Captain Video . . . mmmm . . . how does it feel to play opposite . . . Mae West!''</p>
        <p>She had caught the editor's angle, as I had not: send an innocent to the symbol of sin. She would play along for publicity's sake, presuming her persona would sell more tickets than her person.</p>
        <p>I asked why she had turned to her first director, Edward Elsner, to stage her shocking ''Sex''; he was famed for directing the actress Maude Adams, no sex symbol.</p>
        <p>''I wanted a director that wasn't too young, one that knew all the old tricks, because . . . mmmm . . . I knew all the new ones.</p>
        <p>''The first man I went to said I didn't stick to a formula. He wasn't my man. The second guy just sputtered that my play was immoral and salacious. He wasn't my man, either.</p>
        <p>''Ed Elsner directed such sweet things,'' she recalled, ''I didn't think he'd like my play. His glasses were broken when I went to see him, so he couldn't read the script himself. I read it to him.</p>
        <p>''He had one of those cruel little smiles,'' she said, smiling a cruel little smile herself. ''He looked like Mephisto. He never laughed once during my reading -- just that little, thin smile. I couldn't figure what was going on in his head.</p>
        <p>''When I finished the first act, I asked him if he wanted me to go on. He just looked at me long and hard and smiled that cruel little smile and said, 'Miss West, I want you to read . . . every . . . single . . . line of it.'</p>
        <p>''Right then I knew -- this was my man!''</p>
        <p>A carefully constructed anecdote, but when delivered by Mae West playing Mae West, devilishly suggestive. She proudly mocked her sexiness even as she exploited men's interest in sex. Unlike glamour girls and sex goddesses before and after, she was nice-tough, good-humored and forthright -- which made her invulnerable.</p>
        <p>Though jailed in 1926 for ''corrupting the morals of youth,'' no scandal touched her personal life. Nor did this mistress of the double entendre stoop to the explicit vulgarity and needless nudity that substitute for sex appeal today.</p>
        <p>As she rose to usher me out, I dared ask if she ever did the shimmy onstage. ''In an Ed Wynn show, I did a shimmy. But never'' -- Miss West reached up to brush an imaginary blond hair off my shoulder, a touch I can feel right now -- ''never did I do the shimmy shewabble!''</p>
        <p>(That's a shimmy with bumps and grinds. Low class. Not our Mae.)</p>
