        <p>Vodafone to Consider Sale Of Some Fixed-Line Assets  Vodafone AirTouch, the world's largest wireless telephone operator, is considering selling the fixed-line assets it acquired when it bought Mannesmann and speeding up the sale of Orange, the British cellular operator, to raise $60 billion, executives close to the company said.</p>
        <p>The company is considering selling Mannesmann's stake in Arcor of Germany and in Infostrada of Italy, the executives said. Vodafone is hoping those assets will bring at least $:15 billion, or $22 billion. [Page C10.]</p>
        <p>Alteon Websystems in 2 Alliances  Alteon Websystems, a manufacturer of switches for Internet communications, intends to announce this week that it has enlisted two powerful allies: Lucent Technologies and Akamai Technologies. Lucent has agreed to sell Alteon's gear under the Lucent brand, and Akamai will sometimes encourage its customers to buy Alteon equipment. [C11.]</p>
        <p>Optical Network Market Heats Up  Judging by sheer buzz, there is nothing in the technology world hotter these days than ''next generation optical networking.'' And the temperature may increase today, when Mayan Networks, a start-up company in Sunnyvale, Calif., plans to announce its first product. In addition, ONI Systems, previously known as Optical Networks, intends to make an initial public offering tomorrow. [C11.]</p>
        <p>A Dot-Com Legal Bill Comes Due  When fast-growing Internet companies began raiding law firms in the Bay Area for employees last year, the firms responded by increasing associates' salary by as much as 40 percent. That set off a chain reaction at other law firms nationwide, which followed suit. But at the companies stealing the lawyers, stock prices stopped rising, bringing the value of millions of stock options into question. Turnover at many California law firms has returned to normal, but the firms are still stuck with the bill for the higher salaries. New Economy. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Path to Web Profits Spans Globe  A flood of statistics suggests that to keep their businesses growing, Internet merchants have to look outside the United States. And yet, with investors demanding that Web merchants find a speedier path to profitability, the merchants can hardly justify the expenses associated with rolling out sites aimed at other nations. Bob Tedeschi: E-Commerce Report. [C15.]</p>
        <p>Renting a Computer Department  Instead of hiring a computing staff to manage a company's accounting and sales management systems, a lot of small-business executives are deciding to ''rent'' their main business software from one of a growing number of Internet companies known as application service providers, which use the Internet to offer a range of software and technology-related services. The trend has caused an explosion of companies specializing in the service. [C4.]</p>
        <p>Report Calls for Copyright Update  The law meant to protect intellectual property on the Internet needs to be updated, the Progressive Policy Institute, a Democratic research center, will recommend in a report to be released today. The report proposes outlawing technologies like the Napster software, which enables Internet users to trade music files with little regard for copyrights. [C6.]</p>
        <p>Post to Print Weekly Sports Section  Beginning June 1, The New York Post will publish a separate weekly newspaper covering local teams. The editors of The Post think a good portion of its readers just cannot get enough of its sports coverage and will be willing to spend an extra $1.50 a week for the new publication, to be called New York Post Sports Week. Ken Chandler, The Post's publisher and editor in chief, said his editors came up with the idea for the paper and saw it as a good chance to extend The Post's brand. [C17.]</p>
        <p>Merger Talks for a Cement Maker  Blue Circle Industries, which earlier this month fought off a $5.7 billion bid from Lafarge of France, said that it had held ''early'' merger talks with Southdown, the second-largest United States cement maker. [C10.]</p>
