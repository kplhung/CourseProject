        <p>Arvydas Sabonis worked his way around the lane, mixing short jump shots with baby hooks. In one stretch, with a smooth release and perfect rotation, he hit 12 of 15 attempts effortlessly.</p>
        <p>Contrary to what the statistics from Game 1 of the Western Conference finals on Saturday indicate, Sabonis, the Portland Trail Blazers' center, can put the ball in the basket. Whether Sabonis can score with Shaquille O'Neal in his face was another matter and among the serious topics confronting the Trail Blazers at today's practice.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the Los Angeles Lakers' 109-94 victory scattered the Trail Blazers on both ends of the court and their locker room. Game 2 is here Monday night.</p>
        <p>On offense, the Blazers must solve the mystery of the vanishing 7-foot3-inch Lithuanian. Sabonis, averaging almost 14 points and 8 rebounds for the playoffs, scored no points and had one rebound in 33 minutes. He took only four shots and was gobbled up by the 41-point, 11-rebound shadow cast by O'Neal.</p>
        <p>Asked if O'Neal was always his most difficult opponent, Sabonis grumbled, ''What do you think?''</p>
        <p>''Not everything was how we planned to play,'' he added. ''Everything happened in the second quarter. After that, things were broken.''</p>
        <p>The Lakers bolted to a 21-point halftime lead, and despite a second-half rally, the Trail Blazers pulled no closer than 9 points. After forward Rasheed Wallace was ejected midway through the third quarter, even more of the frontcourt burden seemingly fell to Sabonis. Yet offensively, he became even less of an option for the Trail Blazers.</p>
        <p>''You have to respect the fact Shaq is a good defender and it's hard to attack him,'' Scottie Pippen said. ''But Sabonis has to take it upon himself to become more aggressive and call for the ball in the low post and work for his shot.''</p>
        <p>Sabonis did score 17 points against the Lakers in a 97-82 Portland victory on Nov. 6. He also got 16 in a 90-87 Trail Blazers loss on Feb. 29. But on Saturday, his futility against O'Neal was evident in that Sabonis never drew a foul.</p>
        <p>''If we can't get anything from Sabonis, we don't have a chance at all in this series,'' guard Damon Stoudamire said. ''We've got to get him involved early and get him some easy baskets and get his confidence going.''</p>
        <p>The Trail Blazers again defended their strategy of fouling O'Neal as much as possible in the fourth quarter. Hoping to parlay his poor free-throw shooting into a comeback, Blazers Coach Mike Dunleavy ordered 12 intentional fouls of O'Neal in the last 5 minutes 27 seconds. He shot a National Basketball Association playoff record 25 foul shots in the quarter, making 12.</p>
        <p>''When it's called for, we'll do it,'' Dunleavy said. ''It's a high-percentage play. I'll trade 2 points for 1 every time.''</p>
        <p>O'Neal was mostly fouled when he did not have the ball until the final two minutes, when an intentional foul away from the play would result in one free throw and the Lakers retaining possession. Also, any player can shoot the free throw.</p>
        <p>The strategy might have an impact beyond this series. Rod Thorn, the N.B.A.'s senior vice president for basketball operations, said today that the league's competition committee was expected to review the situation after the playoffs and might consider extending the rule on intentional fouls to earlier in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>''It's something that really hasn't happened in a playoff game like that before,'' Thorn said in an interview on NBC. ''It did catch our attention.''</p>
        <p>Dunleavy said he spoke privately with Wallace, whose ejection after a second technical foul was not well received by teammates. According to audio replays of the altercation, the official Ron Garretson tossed Wallace for staring and trying to intimidate him.</p>
        <p>''He said, 'Mike, I didn't say a word, I didn't say a word,' '' Dunleavy said. ''I told him that ultimately, we need him on the floor. However that happens, I'm in favor of it. For the team, we're not going to win this series if he's not out there.''</p>
        <p>Dunleavy said he did not call the league office and did not plan to.</p>
        <p>''I will say that Shaq's not going to get thrown out of a game for staring,'' Dunleavy said. ''He's much more intimidating than Rasheed Wallace, in my mind.''</p>
