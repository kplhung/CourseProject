        <p>John Thompson has let it be known to the world that Patrick Ewing's boastful statement at the start of this series was nothing new. Ewing and Alonzo Mourning, both former players for Thompson at Georgetown, are constantly taunting one another, bragging about who the better player is, according to their old coach.</p>
        <p>But despite claiming two weeks ago that he was still the best center in the Eastern Conference, Ewing is sensitive to the feelings of his protege. So when he telephones Mourning tomorrow for what he said would be their first post-series conversation, he will refrain from braggadocio. In fact, Ewing said it would be about a month before he ribs his good friend about the Knicks' supremacy over the Miami Heat.</p>
        <p>''I'll wait until the summer,'' Ewing said yesterday, after his team's 83-82 victory over Miami in the seventh game of the Eastern Conference semifinals. ''It's too heated, too heated.''</p>
        <p>Even at 37, Ewing seems to handle heated situations better than Mourning, who at 30 is in the prime of his career. Though Mourning, who averaged 23.1 points, 10.6 rebounds and 2.7 blocks, clearly established his superiority over Ewing, it was the Knicks' old, declining, surgically rebuilt captain who shined brighter in the most significant moments of this series.</p>
        <p>While Ewing dunked in the game-winning points tonight over Clarence Weatherspoon -- a play that was made possible when Mourning gambled for the steal and allowed Ewing a lane to the basket -- Mourning missed 3 of 5 free throws in the fourth quarter and watched two teammates take the Heat's last two shots of the game.</p>
        <p>While Mourning recorded 14 of his 29 points and 5 of his 13 rebounds in the largely inconsequential first quarter, Ewing registered 14 of his 20 points, 9 of his 10 rebounds and both of his blocks in the second half.</p>
        <p>Game 6 was similar, with Ewing scoring 4 points in the last 3 minutes 21 seconds and making the steal that preceded Allan Houston's game-winning free throws with 17.6 seconds left. Mourning, meanwhile, was passing the ball to the rookie Anthony Carter for a last-gasp 3-pointer that missed.</p>
        <p>There is one legitimate explanation for why Ewing had more success down the stretch: because of the Knicks' other offensive weapons he does not draw the attention that Mourning (who was double-teamed by Ewing and Larry Johnson all game) demands. Ewing therefore gets free in the end, while Mourning gets swarmed and smartly passes to a teammate.</p>
        <p>But on the other hand, why, even with Houston, Latrell Sprewell and the clutch-shooting Johnson, was it Ewing who throughout this series made game-turning plays as the clock neared zero? And why did Mourning's most dominant minutes come earlier in the games?</p>
        <p>''Naturally, you're talking about an older player versus a younger player, but we give him a lot of help defensively,'' said Don Chaney, a Knicks assistant coach. ''And Patrick has an unbelievable amount of pride and a huge heart. And I think that's the thing that neutralizes everything. He comes to play every night and he really competes against Mourning.''</p>
        <p>Ewing, who averaged 17.5 points and 14 rebounds when the Knicks faced elimination in the last two games, knows the pain Mourning feels. After all, he has made a futile chase of the championship ring for 15 years. And he had a nemesis of his own in Michael Jordan.</p>
        <p>''I feel for him,'' Ewing said. ''He's my friend. But one of us had to win and one of us had to lose.''</p>
        <p>Mourning, who blamed the series loss on the officials -- claiming injustice for the Game 6 foul called on Dan Majerle with 17.6 seconds left and what he called a phantom timeout by Latrell Sprewell with 2.1 seconds left tonight -- did not regret not having forced up the game's final shots.</p>
        <p>''I had the ball in my hands and they ran two guys at me, so I had to kick it to Mash,'' Mourning said, referring to Jamal Mashburn, who shot 3 for 15 in scoring 7 points. ''I would have taken the last shot if I had a good look at it.''</p>
        <p>Despite his dejection, Mourning found it in his heart to wish Ewing well in his quest for a title, though he cannot root for the Knicks.</p>
        <p>''He's been productive for them all year long,'' Mourning said. ''You guys can say all you want about him but he continues to produce for them. Ya'll continue to talk about trading the man and ya'll degrade him.</p>
        <p>''I wish nothing but the best for him, but I don't give a damn about the Knicks, to tell you the truth.''</p>
        <p>With victory on his side and several clutch moments, Ewing could have easily beaten his chest about his pre-series statement that he was the best big man in the East. But, perhaps out of love for his friend, he refused to recite that tune again.</p>
        <p>''Alonzo's definitely one of the top centers, if not the top one, in the East,'' Ewing said.</p>
        <p>This summer, he will probably not be so humble when kidding with Mourning.</p>
