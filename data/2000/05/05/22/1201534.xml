        <p>With the publication of his first book, ''Paris de Nuit,'' in 1932, Brassai did more than win immediate acclaim as a photographer. In what was already a much photographed city, he created iconic images of nighttime Paris that redefined how it was seen, almost as if darkness were its natural condition. In the process he established an artistic trademark that, if exploited, would have assured him a lifetime of fortune as well as fame.</p>
        <p>Brassai, however, was something of a reluctant photographer. He never had a studio, he never worked on news events or fashion shoots, he never did commercial portraits, he never considered photography to be that important. He took up photography almost by accident, but it was his love of art and literature that shaped his vision of the world. The idea of endlessly recording Paris by night was inconceivable to him.</p>
        <p>The artists, writers and intellectuals in his circle also understood that photography was only one of his interests. ''I am not at all surprised that you are also a good orator -- and a painter and a sculptor and a writer too,'' Henry Miller, a friend from prewar days in Paris, told him in a nostalgic letter sent from California in 1948. ''I'll never forget your speech about Goethe and Thomas Aquinas in the middle of the night. I'd love to have a copy in German.''</p>
        <p>While remembered as a photographer, then, Brassai was always reaching beyond photography. He was drawn to Miller and the poets Jacques Prevert and Henri Michaux -- and photographed them -- because he was fascinated by the written word. He photographed Picasso, Matisse, Bonnard and Giacometti, not because they were famous, but because he identified with them as artists.</p>
        <p>This, at least, is the persuasive thesis of the largest ever retrospective of his work, which is being presented at the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris through June 26 and which will later travel to Verona, Florence, London, Tokyo and Berlin. ''Brassai,'' as it is called, naturally focuses on his photography, but it also exhibits his drawings and sculptures, shows a short film that won him a prize at the Cannes film festival in 1956 and recalls his career as a journalist and writer.</p>
        <p>This show has a special advantage. ''Brassai: The Eye of Paris,'' the well-received exhibition organized last year by the Houston Museum of Fine Arts (and seen during the winter at the National Gallery of Art in Washington), was built around American collections of his work. But ''Brassai'' in Paris was able to tap the archives of both the Pompidou and the photographer's widow, Gilberte. As a result, 100 of the 450 works on display are being shown in public for the first time.</p>
        <p>Many of these offer new insight into how Brassai worked. His images of Paris night life, of couples in bars or solitary figures on park benches, earned him the nickname ''pickpocket of reality,'' as if, like Henri Cartier-Bresson, he captured ''decisive moments.'' But archive photographs in the show demonstrate that, rather than snapping away surreptiously, Brassai worked slowly and openly, taking a series of photographs before finding a composition that pleased him.</p>
        <p>Some nighttime series were clearly staged, like those taken of women in a popular brothel, Chez Suzy, of a prostitute and her client in a hotel on the Rue Quincampoix and of young hoods hanging out in the Italian quarter. In all of these he was intent on creating a mise en scene to suggest a narrative. The man in overcoat and trilby seen entering Chez Suzy was not ''caught in the act''; he was evidently a friend who walked up the steps several times until Brassai was satisfied.</p>
        <p>Brassai's nude photographs, famous in their own right, become even more interesting when seen beside his drawings and stone sculptures of naked women. As a student sketching models in Berlin, he portrayed women with narrow torsos and exaggeratedly Rubensian hips, a ''look'' that is echoed in the Cycladic shapes of his little statues, the photographic poses that emphasize rotund rears and other nude drawings done 20 years later.</p>
        <p>His artist's eye was not accidental. Born as Gyula Halasz in the then Hungarian (now Romanian) town of Brasso in 1899, he attended high school in Budapest and served in the Austro-Hungarian Army in World War I before entering the Academy of Fine Arts in Budapest in 1918. Two years later he continued his studies at the Academy of Fine Arts at Charlottenburg in Berlin where, just as significantly, he discovered Goethe. Yet if his purpose was to become an artist, he was also restless. In 1924 he moved to Paris.</p>
        <p>To make ends meet, he became a journalist, covering sports events for a Hungarian newspaper and writing features for German magazines. And because these features needed illustration, he began to meet photographers, among them a fellow Hungarian, Andre Kertesz. In 1929 Halasz bought his first camera so he, too, could take photographs for his articles. And, given his Bohemian way of life, it seemed natural for him to photograph Paris after dark. ''Paris de Nuit,'' with 60 atmospheric black-and-white images, was the result. It brought him a new career and a new identity: adapting the name of his birthplace, he became Brassai.</p>
        <p>The book's success led to invitations to photograph sculptures by Picasso in his studio on the Rue La Boetie and to collaborate with Andre  Breton's Surrealist review, Minotaure. He accepted both. The first led to a lifelong friendship with Picasso and the 1964 book of memoirs, ''Conversations with Picasso.'' (''Read this book if you want to understand me,'' Picasso said approvingly.) The second drew him into Breton's circle, although he always rejected being termed a Surrealist.</p>
        <p>''They considered my photographs 'surrealist' because they revealed a phantasmal and unreal Paris, plunged in darkness and fog,'' he later wrote. ''But the surrealism of my images was nothing more than reality rendered fantastic by the way it is seen. I sought only to capture reality because nothing is more surreal than that.''</p>
        <p>One example of this surreal reality might be the wall portraits that he called ''Graffiti.'' These were not concerned with words in the modern sense of graffiti, but rather with the texture and shapes of crumbling facades eroded by weather or marked by some amateur artist's knife. Later in life, when Brassai tried his hand at color photography, these ''Graffiti'' came even closer to abstract paintings. But, as he liked to point out, they were still only walls.</p>
        <p>After Nazi Germany occupied France in June 1940, Brassai refused to seek permission to continue working as a photographer or journalist. Instead, he took up drawing again. (He published a book of his drawings in 1946, with a preface by Prevert.) He also wrote a short book, ''Bistro-Tabac,'' about life in occupied Paris. Then, from 1943, he again accepted Picasso's invitation to photograph his sculptures, this time in the artist's studio on the Rue des Grands-Augustins.</p>
        <p>After the war resuming a relationship with Harper's Bazaar that began in 1937, Brassai was free to photograph anything he wished, with Paris and its artists -- Maillol, Braque, Beckett and Ionesco were among his new subjects -- favored by the magazine. His own interests, though, remained eclectic. He wrote a book, ''The Story of Maria,'' with a preface by Miller, about a humble domestic servant. He made the film, ''As Long as There Are Animals,'' that won the prize at Cannes. And while he never returned to Hungary, he traveled widely.</p>
        <p>The Paris show, which is inspired by the 100th anniversary of Brassai's birth (he died in 1984), is organized around key periods in his life, with sections dedicated to ''Paris de Nuit,'' his work for Minotaure, his drawings and sculptures, and his so-called ''Transmutations,'' engravings made on glass plate that already carry a nude image.</p>
        <p>The show also evokes three significant Brassai exhibitions: ''Five French Photographers'' at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1951, which featured Mr. Cartier-Bresson, Robert Doisneau, Izius and Willy Ronis as well as Brassai; ''Language of the Wall: Parisian Graffiti'' in 1956, also at the Modern; and ''Art Mural'' at the Galerie Recontre in Paris in 1970.</p>
        <p>More surprising, perhaps, this is the first Brassai retrospective held in Paris. Yet it achieves its objective. His photographs of Paris at night have long been part of the city's visual language, but other Brassais -- the draftsman, sculptor, writer, filmmaker, even the orator -- were less well known. By presenting him as the complete artist, this show also uses his life to make a broader point: that creators are enriched when they avoid isolation in their own art form.</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 29, 2000, Monday  An article last Monday about works by the photographer Brassai at the Georges Pompidou Center in Paris misspelled the name of another French photographer, whose work was shown with his at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1951. He was Izis, not Izius.</p>
