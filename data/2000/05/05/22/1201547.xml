        <p>A crucial argument revolving around jazz -- and one that hasn't been heard much in decades -- is whether the music needs to be connected to its roots in dance.</p>
        <p>Roger Pryor Dodge, the dancer and jazz enthusiast, was an eloquent, committed writer on this topic. As he explained in ''The Dance-Basis of Jazz,'' a 1945 essay, jazz's ideal state of health is to have three overlapping columns of fans: those who like to listen to it, those who like to dance to it and those who like to do both. Though he acknowledged that jazz must grow beyond the dance hall, he sensed in jazz a virility that needed grounding in rhythm, and the most natural, organic source of rhythm was, of course, dancing.</p>

        <p>A crucial argument revolving around jazz -- and one that hasn't been heard much in decades -- is whether the music needs to be connected to its roots in dance.</p>
        <p>Roger Pryor Dodge, the dancer and jazz enthusiast, was an eloquent, committed writer on this topic. As he explained in ''The Dance-Basis of Jazz,'' a 1945 essay, jazz's ideal state of health is to have three overlapping columns of fans: those who like to listen to it, those who like to dance to it and those who like to do both. Though he acknowledged that jazz must grow beyond the dance hall, he sensed in jazz a virility that needed grounding in rhythm, and the most natural, organic source of rhythm was, of course, dancing.</p>
        <p>It was a nuanced view with some strong prejudices stirred in. Writing in the age of the Jazz at the Philharmonic concerts, Dodge frowned upon the public jam session: he felt it was too much a soloists' medium. ''When inspiration leaves the player,'' he wrote, and the dance no longer supports him, he becomes ''a screwball player.'' He continued, ''When inspiration leaves a dance man, his middle-of-the-road playing will be better than that of the uninspired jam-session man gone frantic.''</p>
        <p>To reapply Dodge's thoughts to jazz today would seem rather academic: it has been at least 40 years since jazz trucked out of the dance hall. Yet Wynton Marsalis and the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra gave Dodge's theory a warming up with the ''For Dancers Only'' tour, which ended in a four-hour dance concert at Roseland Ballroom on Friday.</p>
        <p>Striking a blow against the screwball impulse, the orchestra played sharp, concise big-band jazz in dance halls across the country, performing new music written by the orchestra's members alongside old material associated with Ellington, Basie, Goodman, Lunceford and Machito.</p>
        <p>At Roseland the orchestra gleamed with an ensemble precision that is rare in jazz, let along swing-dance music. Mr. Marsalis mentioned from the stage that the concert wasn't an exercise in nostalgia; his point was that good swing (the rhythmic quality, not the musical genre) is timeless. But he and the band were playing to a swing-dance crowd that was certainly deep in nostalgia: the older set certainly gravitates toward older music, and the younger set, in spectator shoes and Punjab pants, attentively exaggerating a 1940's black subculture.</p>
        <p>The Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra doesn't fit the profile of the recent swing-dance revival: it lacks the bright clothes, comic posturing and manic energy that would make it part of the fad. But musically it has it all over bands like Big Bad Voodoo Daddy or the Royal Crown Revue.</p>
        <p>It can be a tight band: in Ernie Wilkins's arrangement of ''Moten Swing,'' a short, popping phrase was inserted into the whispering prologue, so cutting and loud that it startled even the most hard-core swing dancers. And it can be a loose band: there was plenty of open space in everything played by the band's pianist, Farid Barron; his contributions were understylized and rhythmically powerful. Solos were to the point: dancers aren't interested in gawking at sophisticated harmony or overexpressive performances.</p>
        <p>As rhythm and execution, the performance was fresh; as repertory and spectacle, it was a stroll through history. A pair of retro swing-dancers, Janice Wilson and Paolo Lanna, danced onstage for a few numbers. And for Ellington's ''Cottontail'' a 12-member dance group, the Grits, performed some gravity-defying Lindy Hopping . Even the new pieces, by band members like Wycliffe Gordon and Ron Westray, tended toward Ellington- and Basie-band models.</p>
        <p>The nagging question is how to achieve the reunion of jazz and dance without forcing it. The easiest solution is to open up jazz's borders a bit. It was important that the band played some Afro-Cuban jazz: if you go to a New York salsa club, you'll find exactly the natural connection between sound and body that the Lincoln Center ensemble is after: a well-dressed crowd, serious about its music, that hasn't come to take part in a retro subculture.</p>
        <p>Do any recent jazz styles have a natural, unforced basis in dance? Yes: you can see one at any jam-band concert by Medeski, Martin and Wood or John Scofield. It's not entirely jazz, but it is improvised music, and it's not particularly accomplished dancing, but it is dancing.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Marsalis and the orchestra have framed the quest in absolute terms, the jazz-for-dancers idea seems prophetic; it's up to audiences, preferably young ones, to confirm this idea with their feet.</p>
