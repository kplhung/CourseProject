      <abstract>
        <p>Letter from Baki Ilkin, Ambassador of Turkey, says contrary to May 9 editorial, new dam will not completely inundate ancient city of Zeugma; says Turkey spends large sums each year to support excavation, preservation and restoration work at ancient sites</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your May 9 editorial ''Watery Grave for a Roman Ruin'' gives the impression that the ancient city of Zeugma will be completely inundated by the Birecik Dam. In fact, the greater and more important part of the city located on the upper slopes of the hills around the dam lake will not be inundated. Excavations in those areas will continue.</p>
        <p>The Turkish authorities began excavations at Zeugma in 1992 and have unearthed seven Roman villas. Last October, an emergency recovery effort was begun. Roman floor mosaics, frescoes and a Mars statue have been recovered. At this stage it would be technically difficult and costly to try to stop or delay the filling of the dam lake. Thus, the government is doing its utmost to salvage as many artifacts as possible before the flooding.</p>

        <p>It is unfair to accuse Turkey of allowing its cultural heritage to be destroyed when the government spends large sums each year to support excavation, preservation and restoration work at ancient sites throughout the country. In this instance, circumstances simply did not work in our favor.</p>
