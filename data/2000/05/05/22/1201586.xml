        <p>Swiss voters broke with their tradition of isolationism today, and approved, by a two-thirds majority, a set of agreements with the European Union that will link their nation more closely with its neighbors.</p>
        <p>The government hopes that the accords are a first step toward joining the 15-country union. But the seven-part package, which removes barriers to trade and commerce, bolsters the Swiss economy without binding it any closer politically, for now, to the rest of Europe.</p>
        <p>The package won particularly strong support in areas close to the borders with France and Germany. Only the Italian-speaking southern canton of Ticino, and one other of the country's 26 cantons, voted against the agreements. The vote in Ticino, which abuts Italy, was driven by fears that provisions allowing freer movement of people would attract cheap labor from northern Italian areas.</p>
        <p>Foes of closer ties with Europe argued that the accords would jeopardize Switzerland's historic independence and neutrality, and lead inevitably to full membership in the European Union -- a step strongly opposed by a substantial segment. Nationalists and anti-immigration forces, who criticized the union's treatment of Austria after Jorg Haider's party entered the national government, joined to force a nationwide popular vote on the accords.</p>
        <p>Swiss government, business and trade unions lobbied for the accords on the ground that they are vital to Switzerland's economic future, which is built on trade because the landlocked country has few raw materials. Its biggest trading partner is the European Union -- with two-thirds of what the country exports going to the bloc, and 80 percent of imports coming from those 15 countries. The package increases Swiss access to European markets and opens up the country's markets in areas like agriculture, aviation, research and transport.</p>
        <p>The biggest winner is likely to be the national carrier, Swissair, which now has a green light to expand in the union's 15 countries.</p>
        <p>The accords were worked out in protracted negotiations after 1992, when the country unexpectedly rejected, by a narrow margin, a plan to join the European Economic Area, which would have tied it closer to the union than the accords approved today. To overcome that defeat, the  government engaged in years of complicated negotiations to come up with the package approved today.</p>
        <p>The head of the ultra-nationalist Swiss People's Party, Ueli Maurer, said: ''The subject of joining the E.U. is finally off the table. E.U. membership is not an issue at least for the foreseeable future.'' But spokesmen for other Swiss political parties hailed the vote as a signal for the government to reignite its campaign to join the union. National sentiment, though, is so uncertain that government ministers said they would not apply for membership before 2004, and that Swiss entry was unlikely before the end of the decade, if then.</p>
        <p>The treaty package has been ratified by the Swiss and European Parliaments, and now faces clearance in the Parliaments of the union's 15 member states before it can take effect in January 2001, as planned.</p>
