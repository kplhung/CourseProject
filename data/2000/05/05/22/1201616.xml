        <p>In the Miami Heat's defining moment today, a reserve took the pivotal shot. And then, with the game to the Knicks freshly lost -- and the Heat's season suddenly in ashes -- one of its most frustrated players ran after a referee, berating him.</p>
        <p>With the Heat losing, 83-82, in the fading seconds at American Airlines Arena, it was left to the backup small forward Clarence Weatherspoon to decide the game. His 12-foot jump shot hit off the side of the rim and signaled an end to Miami's season.</p>
        <p>''I'm driving the ball and I'm seeing four seconds on the clock,'' said Weatherspoon, in the game because the starter P. J. Brown had fouled out. ''Who else you throw it to? I wanted us to have a chance of rebounding the ball, and I didn't want the clock to run out.''</p>
        <p>What happened after the defeat showed the depth of Miami's despair. Small forward Jamal Mashburn, who thought the officiating most likely cost Miami this victory so crucial to its psyche, cornered one of the game referees.</p>
        <p>What did he say?</p>
        <p>''I told them they stink,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mashburn thought in particular that a foul should have been called on a drive to the basket he made with two and a half minutes left and the score tied at 79.</p>
        <p>''There was contact,'' he said. ''If you're going to let us play, let us play throughout the whole game. Don't sway one way or another. Be consistent with it. I don't think they were very consistent.''</p>
        <p>Mashburn, who had largely exorcised the demons of his previous failures against the Knicks with his play in this series, had a nightmarish game to carry into the off-season. He made just 3 of 15 field-goal attempts, shot no free throws and had two turnovers.</p>
        <p>In the game's final 7 minutes 42 seconds, he had the ball last on a shot-clock violation, launched an out-of-control shot with the Heat up by 4 points, missed on the drive in which he thought he was fouled and misfired on a medium-range jump shot with the Heat trailing by a point.</p>
        <p>Mashburn said there was a feeling of shock in the locker room. This is the third straight season that the Knicks have eliminated the Heat.</p>
        <p>''I feel sorry for the people in this locker room,'' he said. ''I feel their pain. Everybody had a little tear in their eye or something. Coach was pretty broken up.''</p>
        <p>He added that no one realized the work schedule the Heat submitted to in order to have a chance at a National Basketball Association title.</p>
        <p>''We put a lot of work into it -- a whole lot more than any other N.B.A. team will ever even think about,'' he said, his head now up and defiant.</p>
        <p>About then, someone asked him whether he thought the N.B.A.'s hierarchy had ordained a Knicks-Los Angeles Lakers final to capture television ratings.</p>
        <p>''Well, if they are going to do that, then they need to send us a memo before the season,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Around the locker room, the Heat echoed Mashburn's sentiment about inconsistent refereeing. Center Alonzo Mourning thought a ''touch foul on the perimeter'' had been allowed to settled Game 6, and that Mashburn had clearly been fouled late today.</p>
        <p>Point guard Tim Hardaway even called for a league investigation into the officiating, before abruptly ending his postgame critique.</p>
        <p>Heat Coach Pat Riley was a little more contrite, but not much.</p>
        <p>''We should have won in spite of it,'' he said. ''There were four fouls where our players just played hard. This is a very difficult loss for my team to take -- we were at home. With as much as we were attacked going to the basket, there was a disparity in the foul calling. It is hard to lose that way.''</p>
        <p>Mourning thought the officials plainly erred after Weatherspoon's missed field-goal attempt with 2.1 seconds left. The Knicks' Latrell Sprewell retrieved the rebound and was granted a timeout. Mourning complained, to no avail, that Sprewell never requested it and, in fact, stepped out of bounds.</p>
        <p>''We have the better team,'' Mourning said. ''No one will be able to convince me otherwise. But sometimes things happen. It's tough to take.''</p>
