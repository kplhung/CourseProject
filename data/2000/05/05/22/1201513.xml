        <p>Letter from Eugene Dwyer says removing copyright laws would hurt only those who have made a business of art (May 15 letter)</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>A letter on May 15 makes the very best argument that can be made against the copyright law when it summons the prospect of a ''new world bereft of any worthwhile art'' thanks to the artist's inability ''to recover the costs of producing art.''</p>
        <p>Of course, there will never be a world without art. But by removing much of the current profitability from art -- music, cinema, painting, sculpture -- a much more genuinely popular art will be free to emerge, with prices determined more by labor and materials than by the limiting of access. Artists themselves will benefit more from an open market for their work. So will patrons of art. The losers will be those who have made a business of art.</p>
