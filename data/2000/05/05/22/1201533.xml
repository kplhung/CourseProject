        <p>Last week as the broadcast television networks paraded their new offerings before their most important constituency, the advertisers, one question loomed above all others: How much Regis is too much Regis?</p>
        <p>Flush with the staggering and totally unexpected success of its game show ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' (a show that was not even scheduled at this time last year), ABC threw down the gauntlet to its competitors by spreading ''Millionaire'' and its host, Regis Philbin, suddenly the biggest star in television, all over its new lineup.</p>
        <p>Next fall ''Millionaire'' will be seen four nights a week, to the exclusion of most everything else on ABC. The network added only four new shows, the fewest ever, meaning it had decided to ride the golden goose of ''Millionaire'' to glory or disaster.</p>
        <p>Perhaps speaking more from hope than conviction, executives at the competing networks were whispering a bit more loudly at their post-announcement parties last week that ''Millionaire'' may have peaked, that its audience was aging and that some shows, like NBC's ''Frasier,'' were starting to prove that quality programming can beat it.</p>
        <p>The message from ABC's competitors, except CBS, was: the way to beat ''Millionaire'' is to go for the young viewer. Each network cited the eye-catching statistic about the median age of the ''Millionaire'' viewer, and how it has edged up from 42, when the show had its summer run last August, to 51 last week.</p>
        <p>Shows are usually considered to be losing their appeal for younger viewers if the median age climbs by more than one year in a season. Audience age has always been a closely watched factor with ''Millionaire'' because game shows generally appeal mainly to older viewers. One reason ''Millionaire'' was dismissed as no threat by the other networks before it went on the air was for that reason.</p>
        <p>But ABC professes to be unconcerned, saying that ''Millionaire'' had maintained its appeal to a remarkable degree and that only the arrival of Daylight Saving Time has really had an impact on the age of its audience, because young people tend to stay out later.</p>
        <p>Stu Bloomberg, the co-chairman of ABC Entertainment, noted that the younger audience numbers for other networks had fallen off this spring far more than the numbers for ''Millionaire.'' ''I'm not worried at all,'' he said, ''because the 18-to-49-year-old numbers for this show are still incredibly strong. They may be off from the show's initial burst, but believe me, I'll take these numbers.'' As for the first whispered predictions of vulnerability for the show, Mr. Bloomberg was happy to cite how often rumors of demise have been exaggerated since first evoked by Mark Twain.</p>
        <p>Perhaps the most interesting showdown involving ''Millionaire'' will take place on Wednesday nights at 8 next fall. Far from running from the ABC juggernaut, three networks aim to challenge the show with new series at that hour. That was unexpected, but each network has its reasons.</p>
        <p>NBC, for example, will introduce ''Titans,'' a steamy new soap opera from the Aaron Spelling factory, hoping to snare the fans who are now bereft of ''Beverly Hills 90210.'' Fox is going with comedy, aiming to steal away younger viewers by bringing back John Goodman as a gay family man in a show called ''Don't Ask.''</p>
        <p>CBS is making perhaps the boldest move by placing its highest profile new show there, a comedy starring Bette Midler. CBS needs to get comedy started on a night other than Monday and is convinced it can establish a beachhead on Wednesday. A number of advertising and television executives seemed to agree in comments during last week's round of parties: ''The Bette Show'' was widely cited as one of the new season's stronger contenders.</p>
        <p>As one senior television studio executive -- neutral in terms of both the show and the network -- put it: ''That was the most impressive programming play to me. Bette Midler seems like an electric star who should work big time on television.''</p>
        <p>But few shows were receiving consistent support. Among the new entries that many of the executives seemed to favor were ''Geena,'' an ABC comedy starring Geena Davis, regarded as highly compatible with the show it is partnered with, ''Dharma and Greg''; ''Gilmore Girls,'' the latest youth drama from WB, though this one does feature some adults  along with the usual teenagers; ''The Fugitive,'' a new take on the television classic, on CBS; ''Fearsum,'' a thriller on Fox from the makers of ''The Blair Witch Project''; and ''The Street,'' a Fox soap opera about Wall Street traders, billed as a male ''Sex and the City,'' since it comes from the same producer.</p>
        <p>The network that seemed to inspire the most detractors was clearly NBC, whose new shows failed to impress. Several of the NBC shows are already heading back for serious revision, headed by ''The Michael Richards Show,'' which NBC is nevertheless counting on to start off its Tuesday night schedule.</p>
        <p>''Our shows are pretty horrible,'' one senior NBC executive said in a moment of candor. ''But worst of all they seem totally unfocused.''</p>
        <p>The executive noted that NBC has always been known for smart, sophisticated, urban comedies, and said it was sorely in need of new ones right now. But the comedies NBC introduced last week were mostly broad in style. Several longtime NBC executives reported that the new schedule stirred some less-than-favorable reviews from some of the network's top management.</p>
        <p>No matter how good or bad the new shows may be, all of them face the problem of making a successful debut. That is because this fall will be the first in television history without a specific premiere week. It will be the first television season in which no new series will be introduced in September. Instead, the season will start officially the first week in October. The reason: NBC will fill the last two and half weeks of September with Olympics coverage from Australia, and except for ABC and ''Millionaire,'' no network is going to use new shows to compete against that.</p>
        <p>''If we marketed and launched new shows before the Olympics, we'd probably have to do it all again after they were over,'' said Sandy Grushow, chairman of Fox Entertainment. ''So it makes more sense to keep our powder dry.''</p>
        <p>The problem is that October is not going to provide any better chance for a clean starting week to the season. The very first week of October will bring the baseball playoffs, which will interrupt schedules at both Fox and NBC, and Oct. 3 will be the night of the first presidential debate. The vice presidential debate will probably be staged the following Sunday, and the Wednesday after that is expected to bring a second presidential debate.</p>
        <p>The big networks will interrupt their schedules for all those events. After that comes the World Series and a week later the November sweeps period begins. There will also be an election night to contend with.</p>
        <p>''It's a nightmare,'' Mr. Bloomberg said.</p>
