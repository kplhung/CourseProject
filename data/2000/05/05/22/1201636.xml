        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, who upon ending his campaign for the Senate intimated that he would work to improve his relationship with minority residents, said in an interview broadcast yesterday that he had ''sympathy, concern and compassion'' for the family of a Haitian-American man killed by the police in March.</p>
        <p>The mayor made the remarks on Saturday in an intensely personal interview with Tim Russert for broadcast yesterday on NBC's ''Meet the Press.'' Mr. Giuliani also said he had no regrets about his decision to drop out of the Senate race, given that he now realized that politics was ''not the most important thing in life.''</p>
        <p>The half-hour interview touched on a broad range of topics, from Mr. Giuliani's thoughts about his political future to his prostate cancer and what he acknowledged might have been bad advice his father once offered him, suggesting that it is more important to be respected than to be loved.</p>
        <p>''You know, fathers make mistakes and fathers are human beings, and I tend to think now that love is more important than I thought,'' the mayor said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani first acknowledged on Thursday that he did not respond properly to the fatal shooting in March of Patrick M. Dorismond, the Haitian-American man, by a plainclothes police officer who had tried to solicit marijuana from him. Mr. Dorismond, a security guard who was standing outside a Midtown bar, was unarmed and was not carrying drugs.</p>
        <p>The mayor said in the ''Meet the Press'' interview that he intended ''to find a way'' to let Mr. Dorismond's family know about his regrets, including possibly a visit with his parents. But the mayor again defended his decision on the day of Mr. Dorismond's shooting to release his juvenile arrest record.</p>
        <p>''What I should have done is to do a lot more to express sympathy, concern, help, assistance, compassion for a situation where, whether justified or unjustified, whatever it turns out, was still a tragic situation,'' the mayor said. ''I think that is where I made a mistake.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani also spoke at length with Mr. Russert about his desire, first expressed on Friday, to try to extend the benefits of New York City's current economic boom to more disaffected communities in the city. The mayor said he had not yet decided how he would do that, but he said he was committed to finding a way ''to break down the barriers that I've created'' as a result of his own sometimes abrasive personality.</p>
        <p>''There are people in the city who feel that they haven't been reached'' by the progress in the city in recent years, the mayor said. ''There are people that feel that I don't care about them, there are people who feel that I don't take them into equal consideration.''</p>
        <p>Outside predominantly black churches in Harlem and Queens yesterday, city residents said they would be watching the mayor to see if he lived up to his vows. Many said they were skeptical that the mayor, who has been criticized for increasing tension between the city authorities and New York's ethnic neighborhoods, would succeed.</p>
        <p>''You know, it is like a leopard changing his spots,'' said Douglas K. Henderson, 65, outside the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem. ''It has got to be some sort of a miracle.''</p>
        <p>Many said they wanted to see him talk with black leaders like the Rev. Al Sharpton and visit in black neighborhoods, and then to act on what he has heard.</p>
        <p>''He needs to lend people of color an ear,'' said Sharon McClarty, 44, a computer technician from Jamaica, Queens. ''He has been talking, but he doesn't listen.''</p>
        <p>Andrea Summers, a mother of two who said she was cut from the welfare rolls as part of the mayor's workfare program, said the mayor needed to soften his harsh stance on welfare. She said she worked at two jobs but could not earn enough to pay the rising rents in Harlem.</p>
        <p>She dismissed the mayor's comments about breaking down barriers. ''He never comes to our parades, never comes meet the people,'' she said. ''He is never here.''</p>
        <p>As the mayor's remarks were televised yesterday, founders of the group 100 Blacks in Law Enforcement Who Care challenged him to compensate the Dorismond family by settling a lawsuit it has filed against the city.</p>
        <p>Attempts to reach Mr. Dorismond's parents, Marie and Andre Dorismond, through their lawyer, Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., were unsuccessful yesterday. But on Saturday, Andre Dorismond dismissed the mayor's recent offers of sympathy.  ''Now it doesn't make sense for him to apologize,'' he said. ''It's been two months since my son died. It's too late.''</p>
        <p>During the ''Meet the Press'' interview, the mayor, who said he was still struggling to decide on which  cancer treatment to choose, appeared relaxed, laughing and joking with Mr. Russert at times, even offering him one of his trademark Godfather impersonations.</p>
        <p>He called the decision to drop out of the Senate race the most difficult of his life, a choice he said he made entirely because of his cancer and not because of the controversy surrounding his relationship with an  East Side woman, Judith Nathan, and his decision earlier this month to separate from his wife.</p>
        <p>''But for the cancer and the timing of the cancer, I would have gone ahead and done it,'' Mr. Giuliani said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani, 55, who has 18 months left in office, deferred questions about his own political future, not indicating if he might make a run for governor or accept an appointment to the cabinet of George W. Bush, if Mr. Bush wins his bid for president.</p>
        <p>''I love politics,'' the mayor said. ''The thing I felt good about as I made the decision'' to leave the Senate race is: ''I finally figured out that politics in not my life. My life is about things that are closer to you and deeper than that.''</p>
        <p>And Mr. Giuliani said he had not yet decided what he would do with the approximately $9 million in unspent campaign contributions he had amassed, noting only that he intended to do as much as he could to support Representative Rick A. Lazio of Long Island.</p>
        <p>''I am going to try to do everything I can to help'' Mr. Lazio, the mayor said, ''if it is advertising, if it's an appearance, if it's figuring out how to make sure they're able to raise money.''</p>
