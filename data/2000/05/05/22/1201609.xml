        <p>The weather was miserable. A cold rain, whipped by strong winds, had laced the city for the better part of two days. Some of the reporters and politicians making their way to City Hall on Friday had been soaked.</p>
        <p>The media crush was so great the press conference had to be held in the Public Hearing Room, instead of the elegant and more intimate Blue Room, where most mayoral press conferences are held.</p>
        <p>The 107th mayor of New York, looking nervous and weary, walked into the hearing room a little before 4 p.m. and announced that he would not run against Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Senate.</p>
        <p>And then Rudolph Giuliani proceeded for the next half hour to present himself as some kind of suddenly changed man.</p>
        <p>''Things happen in life for reasons that sometimes you only figure out afterwards,'' he said. ''And there is something good that comes out of this. A lot of good things come out of it. I think I understand myself a lot better. I think I understand what's important to me better.''</p>
        <p>The mayor tried in his inexperienced way to express a sense of warmth and compassion. He seemed to say that he would like to establish some bridge of understanding between himself and ethnic minority groups in the city.</p>
        <p>''Many people in the city have felt a big change, a great sense of optimism,'' he said. ''They've gotten a lot of help and they've gotten a lot of benefits, and they feel very differently. But it hasn't reached everyone in this city. And there are a lot of people who haven't felt that. And I'm going to dedicate myself to trying to figure out how we can get them to feel that, too, including maybe changes I have to make in the way I approach it, the way I look at it.''</p>
        <p>The mayor is going through a period of extended agony and most New Yorkers feel he deserves a break and our best wishes. I hope he defeats the cancer that threatens him and finds the personal happiness he seeks.</p>
        <p>But with all due respect, he comes a little late to the table of fair play and brotherhood. Too late.</p>
        <p>This instantaneous conversion from the man who wielded the whip to the tender and ultra-sensitive soul concerned about the blacks and the downtrodden, the people without health insurance and those who have to face the dark night of grave illness alone -- well, it's a little tough to take seriously. This sudden abstract embrace of all things humane is conveniently timed to cast a helpful glow on Mr. Giuliani's image of himself as he does battle with his own grave illness.</p>
        <p>In other words, it's all about him.</p>
        <p>Blacks whom I've talked to over the past couple of days have tended to point out rather dryly that it took an encounter with a potentially fatal illness for the notion of empathy, compassion and real fairness to even dawn on Mr. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>''He never cared about us,'' said Lucie Greene, a black woman who lives on the East Side of Manhattan. ''His whole thing was to show that he could discipline us. So let him get his treatment and get on with his life. I don't wish him any more bad luck. But don't try to sell me any stories about he cares about me because he doesn't.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani's career, even more than most politicians, has been about power and control. He ruled by fear, ruthlessly, and created a carefully calculated image of powerhouse strength and invulnerability. Most of the city and much of the nation bought into that image.</p>
        <p>And then came the cancer diagnosis and the feelings of fear, sadness and vulnerability that inevitably accompanied it. And it turned out that Rudolph Giuliani was just a man, after all.</p>
        <p>He will be helped by the many good wishes of the ordinary people of New York, which is to say, the kindness of strangers. The city has always been kinder than he's ever been.</p>
        <p>No one is holding the mayor to his impulsive promises in his hour of need. We've heard them before. On election night 1997, in the victory speech televised to the city, he said:</p>
        <p>''We have to do a better job of serving all of you. We have to reach out to all of you. And if we haven't, I apologize. I'm sorry, and it is my personal commitment that we will try, endlessly and tirelessly, to bring all of you into the kind of success and optimism we have in this room.''</p>
        <p>Who knows? Maybe he meant it when he said it.</p>
