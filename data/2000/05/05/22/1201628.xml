        <p>Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners Worldwide in New York, part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, has resigned the United States account of KPMG International by withdrawing from a review for the company's worldwide account. Lowe Lintas had handled the American assignment, with billings estimated at $30 million, since 1997; the total worldwide billings were estimated at $90 million.</p>
        <p>George Ledwith, a spokesman for KPMG in Montvale, N.J., said KPMG was disappointed that Lowe Lintas withdrew from the review, but the move ''leads us to believe Lowe knew they could not win the global business.''</p>

        <p>Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners Worldwide in New York, part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies, has resigned the United States account of KPMG International by withdrawing from a review for the company's worldwide account. Lowe Lintas had handled the American assignment, with billings estimated at $30 million, since 1997; the total worldwide billings were estimated at $90 million.</p>
        <p>George Ledwith, a spokesman for KPMG in Montvale, N.J., said KPMG was disappointed that Lowe Lintas withdrew from the review, but the move ''leads us to believe Lowe knew they could not win the global business.''</p>
        <p>Lee Garfinkel, chairman and chief creative officer at Lowe Lintas U.S., said: ''Last week, KPMG said the reason for the review was the 'resounding success' of our U.S. campaign. It was conflicting comments like these that convinced us to withdraw from the review.''</p>
        <p>The review, which began last month, now continues with three agencies in New York: BBDO Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group; Bates Worldwide, part of the Cordiant Communications Group; and J. Walter Thompson, part of the WPP Group.</p>
