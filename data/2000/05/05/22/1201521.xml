        <p>James Griffin has been trying to bring smell into the candy-buying experience since his early days as an executive of  Nestle USA. He recalled an experiment with the scratch-and-sniff card, a decades-old marketing tool that releases a faint aroma once the customer has scratched off a thin coating. Trials were a resounding disappointment. ''If it's sitting next to dog food in the warehouse it would pick up the smell,'' Mr. Griffin said. ''You couldn't control it.''</p>
        <p>These days, Mr. Griffin is the president of e-Candy (www.ecandy.com), an online candy store that, among other things, just signed a deal to distribute Nestle's confections.</p>
        <p>Once again, he is trying to let candy customers smell before they buy, but this time the approach is far more sophisticated. E-Candy, based in Los Angeles, is working with Digiscents, a small company that is developing a digital language for recording and recreating smells, using a device attached to a personal computer.</p>
        <p>Eventually, Mr. Griffin predicts, customers who call up e-Candy's site will be able to smell the jelly beans, chocolates and sour gummies. ''Candy is very much a sensory experience,'' Mr. Griffin said.</p>
        <p>E-Candy is not the only consumer goods maker working with Digiscents, which is based in Oakland, Calif. Digiscents announced a deal last week with Procter &amp; Gamble to collaborate on research that would take advantage of P.&amp; G.'s $2 billion research and development budget.</p>
        <p>Although P.&amp; G. declined to disclose details, the deal presumably could lead to new ways for online customers to sample the company's consumer products, which include Crest toothpaste, Tide detergent, Pantene shampoo and Pringles potato chips.</p>
        <p>In the view of Digiscents, nearly everything can and will be ''scent enabled'' someday, including computer games, electronic greeting cards and travel brochures.</p>
        <p>Digiscents is creating a registry of thousands of scents that developers can license, along with a digital language for recording, recreating and transmitting the fragrances. The scents are played back by a tiny device called a scent synthesizer that will activate various combinations of chemicals to create each aroma. The company hopes to start selling the device early next year for $50 to $200.</p>
