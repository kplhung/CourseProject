        <p>The law meant to protect intellectual property on the Internet needs to be updated, a Democratic research center recommends in a report to be released on Monday.</p>
        <p>The report proposes outlawing technologies like the controversial Napster software that enables Internet users to trade music files with little regard to copyrights.</p>
        <p>The Progressive Policy Institute, which is affiliated with the Democratic Leadership Council, is releasing its policy brief, ''Napster and Online Piracy: The Need to Revisit the Digital Millennium Copyright Act,'' ahead of a House Small Business Committee hearing scheduled for Wednesday to examine Internet music technologies.</p>
        <p>The hearing is expected to focus on  how small recording labels and lesser-known musical acts are using the Internet and downloadable music to gain market share. Scheduled witnesses include Chuck D, founder of Rapstation.com, who has become a vocal proponent of Napster, which uses a file format called MP3. At Rapstation.com, music fans can download MP3 files of lesser-known artists and those who have not yet signed recording contracts.</p>
        <p>But the Progressive Policy Institute hopes the hearing, and its report, will also focus attention on what it says are needed updates to the Digital Millennium Copyright Act.</p>
        <p>That law, passed in 1998 to extend traditional copyright protections to digital works, specifically exempted providers of Internet access services and search services from liability when their users transmit pirated works.</p>
        <p>Napster, a company in San Mateo, Calif., that operates an online service, has cited those exemptions as a defense against lawsuits from major record companies, the heavy metal band Metallica and the rap artist Dr. Dre, who have accused it of engaging in vicarious copyright infringement. The groups are seeking damages that could add up to billions of dollars.</p>
        <p>Napster's software works like a co-op. It enables users to swap songs by trading files in the MP3 format -- a data-compression formula that turns CD's music tracks into computer files. Record companies call it a haven for piracy because it enables distribution of music without any copyright protection.</p>
        <p>''To say that Napster should qualify as an I.S.P. is not what the law intended, although it is possible the law could be interpreted that way,'' said Robert D. Atkinson, director of the institute and a co-author of the report. ''So we just say, let's tighten the law.'' I.S.P. is industry shorthand for Internet service provider.</p>
        <p>The report recommends that the digital copyright law be amended ''to hold Napster, its users, and similar services accountable for copyright violations while maintaining protections from liability for service providers that are innocent bystanders to digital piracy.''</p>
        <p>The report proposes that services like Napster be required to collect identifiable and verifiable information from its users, such as addresses and credit card information. And it recommends that the services be required to remove infringing users within a specific period, perhaps a week, once they are identified.</p>
        <p>Napster has argued that it should not be held accountable if its users illegally trade copyrighted music over the Internet because it does not itself store the music on its computers or itself engage in trading copyrighted music. Recently, however, Napster did bar 300,000 fans of the rock group Metallica, after the band said the fans had infringed its copyrights using the service.</p>
        <p>Mr. Atkinson said no legislation had yet been drafted to address the recommendations in his report. But he said he hoped that Wednesday's hearing would raise awareness in Washington for the need to update the digital copyright law to address new technologies.</p>
        <p>Any such proposals, would likely be met with resistance from the civil  libertarian community, which opposed the original law as potentially limiting access to works that belong in the public domain.</p>
        <p>''To say you are going to take a whole new category of software and strangle it in its infancy because one of its first uses resulted in piracy -- that's a bad idea,'' said John Gilmore, president of the Electronic Frontier Foundation, an online liberties group based in San Francisco.</p>
        <p>Other likely opponents are telecommunications companies and Internet companies that worked for years to reach the compromise that was passed into law.</p>
        <p>''It could open a Pandora's box,'' said Peter Harter, a lobbyist for a company called eMusic, who worked for Netscape when the digital copyright law was passed. Mr. Harter is among the witnesses scheduled to testify Wednesday.</p>
