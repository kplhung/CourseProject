        <p>Columbia's men's varsity lightweight crew scored its biggest victory in 77 years of lightweight competition, winning the Joseph Wright Trophy for varsity eights today in a dramatic finish that hushed the crowd. Not until the awards were announced -- Harvard third, Yale second, Columbia first -- did the roar go up for the Lions, who had competed every year in the 55-year history of this regatta but never before finished first.</p>
        <p>The finish at the end of the 2,000-meter Lake Quinsigamond course was so close, 11-hundredths of a second, that neither Columbia nor Yale knew which had won. In the final 250 meters, Yale overtook Columbia and Harvard, which had been exchanging the lead. Harvard faded, but Columbia had one last spurt, and on the final stroke regained the lead.</p>
