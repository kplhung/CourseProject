        <p>It took decades of international pressure and weeks of intense negotiations, but when a monthlong conference of more than 185 nations ended at the United Nations this weekend, the five original atomic powers had agreed for the first time to the ''unequivocal'' elimination of nuclear arms.</p>
        <p>Secretary General Kofi Annan called the move, part of a broad agreement to reinvigorate nuclear arms control, ''a significant step forward in humanity's pursuit of a more peaceful world.''</p>
        <p>The five nuclear powers -- Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States -- never considered setting a deadline for meeting the goal, and there are strong lobbies in every country arguing for retention of nuclear arms.</p>
        <p>But their pledge, brokered by a group of seven middle-level powers calling themselves the New Agenda Coalition, gives at least a psychological lift to flagging efforts to contain and abolish nuclear weapons, the aim of a 30-year-old treaty whose achievements and failures have been under review by the United Nations conference.</p>
        <p>A Clinton administration official, who spoke on condition that he not be identified, said last night that the agreement did not represent a significant shift in United States policy. But the wording of the document did mark a break with earlier public statements.</p>
        <p>Until now, the United States and other nuclear-weapons nations have always insisted on qualifiers like the ''eventual'' elimination of arms.</p>
        <p>The final document pledges ''an unequivocal undertaking by the nuclear-weapon states to accomplish the total elimination of their nuclear arsenals leading to nuclear disarmament to which all states parties are committed.''</p>
        <p>Japan's chief negotiator, Ambassador Seiichiro Noboru, who has been active in a six-month campaign to put muscle in disarmament promises during this treaty review conference, was jubilant.</p>
        <p>''It is happy news that we could get agreement for the first time without the infamous word 'ultimate,' '' he said in an interview at the end of a meeting on Thursday.</p>
        <p>The Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons was adopted in 1968, went into effect in 1970 and was extended indefinitely in 1995. The pact, the cornerstone of international nuclear controls, is reviewed every five years.</p>
        <p>This year's conference was considered by arms control experts to be especially important because in light of recent setbacks, including India's  and Pakistan's tests of nuclear weapons in 1998 and Congress's refusal last year to approve a treaty banning nuclear testing.</p>
        <p>India, which has long aspired to great-power status, has used the argument that it is unfair for some countries to keep nuclear bombs while others are not permitted to have them under the nonproliferation treaty, which succeeding Indian governments have refused to sign.  Only three other nations have also refused: Cuba, Israel and Pakistan, which insists that India go first. Israel, which is assumed to have the bomb, was singled out for the first time this year for its refusal to sign the treaty and allow comprehensive inspections of its nuclear facilities.</p>
        <p>Those who have not signed cannot take part in the five-year review conferences, except as observers.</p>
        <p>In the final document of this year's conference -- which was finally approved late Saturday after being held up for 24 hours by a dispute between the United States and Iraq over how to word the status of Iraqi cooperation with nuclear inspections -- nuclear and non-nuclear nations recommitted themselves to forgo nuclear testing.</p>
        <p>China, in a break with the past, agreed to greater openness in sharing information about its atomic programs.</p>
        <p>Some diplomats and disarmament experts say that the greater flexibility shown by the United States this year may have been rooted in its determination not to have its proposed antimissile nuclear defense program criticized in the final conference statement.</p>
        <p>The antimissile program has been under steady criticism at the conference, where delegates from many nations said it could undermine decades of arms control agreements by provoking a new kind of weapons race.</p>
        <p>The agreement to drop the qualifiers for the elimination of the weapons came on Thursday after Russia and France withdrew objections. The new wording emerged on Wednesday after days and nights of closed-door meetings between the five original nuclear powers and the New Agenda Coalition -- Brazil, Egypt, Ireland, Mexico, New Zealand, South Africa and Sweden.</p>
        <p>Speaking for arms control groups that welcomed the step, Rebecca Johnson, the director of Disarmament Diplomacy, a British journal covering arms control, said that the statement was very important because it reinforced a World Court  judgment that ''there is a legal obligation to negotiate the elimination of nuclear weapons.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Johnson said previous documents issued at reviews of the nonproliferation treaty had much ''woollier'' provisions.</p>
        <p>''To get this paragraph on the unequivocal undertaking on the elimination of nuclear arsenals is a very much clearer statement of objectives and purpose,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Other antinuclear groups were not happy, however, describing the new pledge as too little, too late.</p>
