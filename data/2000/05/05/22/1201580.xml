        <p>Well, he is no Secretariat. And, at least for the moment, he is not even Red Bullet.</p>
        <p>In something less than two minutes, Fusaichi Pegasus fell from his pedestal on Saturday when Red Bullet outran him in the homestretch of the 125th Preakness and, just like that, racing lost its chance that the  $4 million flying horse would continue flying toward the Triple Crown. Racing people had joined the public in almost conceding the crown to Fusaichi Pegasus, acclaiming him as a superhorse, hailing him as the horse who would rescue the sport from its steep decline.</p>
        <p>But if this is the end of the dream, it is likely the start of a new rivalry that may achieve the same goals. Fusaichi Pegasus and Red Bullet, first and second in the Wood Memorial in April, second and first in the Preakness in May. Both were destined for New York, where the Belmont Stakes will be run on June 10, and will most likely meet again, perhaps then and there.</p>
        <p>Joe Orseno, who trains Red Bullet for Frank Stronach of Austria and Canada, put his horse on a van for New York yesterday and said, ''They will be facing each other again.'' And Neil Drysdale, who trains Fusaichi Pegasus for Fusao Sekiguchi of Tokyo, said that his horse would ''temporarily go to New York on Monday morning, and he seems suited to the Belmont because he's a big, long-striding horse.''</p>
        <p>Racing can mourn its beaten favorite after the Preakness, but two horses may still turn out to be better than one. Affirmed and Alydar. Easy Goer and Sunday Silence. You play the hand that is dealt, and right now fate has dealt two aces with dramatic prospects.</p>
        <p>Racing has waited 22 years for a horse who could withstand the rigors of winning the Kentucky Derby, the Preakness and the Belmont in five weeks' time. In each of the last three years, it looked imminent. But Silver Charm, Real Quiet and Charismatic all were thwarted in the final yards of a race that took them a mile and a half. And since Pegasus captured the Derby with classical power and a kind of majesty, racing sensed that the superhorse had arrived.</p>
        <p>Maybe he has. But as Stronach put it, ''Horses are not machines.''</p>
        <p>How did it happen? You can find four elements to the equation, starting with the fact that Fusaichi Pegasus ran in the Kentucky Derby two weeks ago and Red Bullet did not.</p>
        <p>Then, when they did meet, they raced on a heavy track that Drysdale described as greasy. Still, as Orseno said, ''We all had to run over it.'' But that is where the fresh horse had the edge. Red Bullet had been biding his time for five weeks since the Wood. And even superhorses may lose a step along the way.</p>
        <p>Then, when the gate opened for the Preakness, the favorite was squeezed between the horses alongside him and lost some momentum. Drysdale does not use that as an excuse. In fact, after flying to Hollywood Park overnight, he said by telephone this morning: ''He pulled up well after the race and was quite bright and playing in the test barn. He wasn't tired. He came up with a tiny cut under a knee, which indicates he got hit by some horse. But that didn't really mean anything.''</p>
        <p>Finally, most of the credit has to go to Red Bullet, who got hooked into a duel with Fusaichi Pegasus in the homestretch and simply outran him by three and three-quarter lengths. Red Bullet was a legitimate challenger, too, despite his four-length loss in the Wood. Since then, he had been training sensationally at Pimlico. And in the Preakness, he had the extra advantage of having Jerry Bailey on his back, providing a flawless ride and making sure that Red Bullet would not beat himself.</p>
        <p>The other members of the cast are generally tossing in the towel. High Yield has made 14 starts, and shows it: 15th in the Derby, 7th in the Preakness. His trainer, D. Wayne Lukas, said he would look through his deep stable for another Belmont horse.</p>
        <p>''Probably Commendable,'' he said. ''He's a fresh horse.''</p>
        <p>Captain Steve, eighth in the Derby and fourth in the Preakness, was headed home to California with Snuck In and Hugh Hefner. Cash Asmussen, the rider on Snuck In, said, ''When Red Bullet went by us, it was like, whoosh.''</p>
        <p>Hal's Hope tired badly to finish 8th and last after running 16th in the Derby. ''He hasn't done any good since we left Florida,'' said Harold Rose, his 88-year-old owner and trainer.</p>
        <p>But Impeachment, third in the Derby and third in the Preakness, was booked into the Belmont. Also listed as probable candidates were seven horses who did not run in the Preakness, namely Aptitude, Wheelaway, Tahkoda Hills, Unshaded, Chief Seattle, Curule and Globalize.</p>
        <p>But the biggest ones were the horses who dueled down the stretch in the Preakness: Red Bullet and Fusaichi Pegasus. And the best is yet to come.</p>
