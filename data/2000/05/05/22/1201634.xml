        <p>It was a typical New York street fair in so many ways: cotton candy, silly balloon hats, rock band, stock option raffle.</p>

        <p>It was a typical New York street fair in so many ways: cotton candy, silly balloon hats, rock band, stock option raffle.</p>
        <p>O.K., it was a little different. With 60-odd Internet companies hawking their wares at the Silicon Alley Street Fair, creativity ruled the day. And the 30-somethings at Asktherobot.com, a job-recruitment company, perhaps best captured the spirit of the day by raffling 500 shares of their soon-to-be-public stock to the winners of a basketball toss.</p>
        <p>''This is the Internet,'' explained Michael Vogel, the chief executive of the company, which started nearly four months ago and plans to go public in a year or so. ''The big calling card to the world is stock options. This is what the Internet is about.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Vogel estimated the potential value of the stock at $25,000, depending on the selling price at the initial public offering.</p>
        <p>Yes, hyperbole ruled the day, as well.</p>
        <p>The fair, after all, was intended in large part to promote Silicon Alley, the concentration of technology and Internet-related companies that have cropped up in and around Manhattan, said Janet Stites, the publisher of the Alleycat News, which organized the fair at Union Square Park with the marketing firm MarketMatch Inc. ''People read about Silicon Alley, they hear about it, but they don't come face to face with it,'' Ms. Stites said. ''It's an economic development issue and a curiosity issue.''</p>
        <p>Curiosity seemed to be winning. Droves of people, despite a chilly drizzle, massed under white tents for demonstrations of all manner of Web sites, brought through a T-1 high-capacity telephone line set up just for the event. And of course, they filled plastic bags with all manner of freebies: T-shirts, flying disks, caps and, of course, software.</p>
        <p>Elaine Kimmel, 59, who lives nearby, toted a bag filled with goodies, a powerful lure for her. But she also recently bought an Internet-only computer after months of surfing the Web at a library, so anything ''dot-com'' would have brought her out.  ''I'm very obsessed with the Internet now,'' she said. ''I'm just thrilled with it. I have so much clutter and thousands of pieces of paper, so I can get rid of it all because all the information is on the Internet.''</p>
        <p>J. C. Cohen of Brooklyn picked up a CD-ROM for a financial services Web site, infogate.com, and walked around in wonder at the variety of companies. Many of them were start-up firms like Asktherobot.com, but mainstays like I.B.M. and U.P.S. also got in on the action, as did out-of-towners like mall.com, a retail site based in Austin, Tex.</p>
        <p>''It's a wider range of companies than I thought,'' Mr. Cohen said.</p>
        <p>Internet service providers, or portals, and companies offering online shopping, though, seemed most abundant. Or at least made the most noise.</p>
        <p>''Come on, lonely Matt here is waiting for somebody to e-mail him!'' cried a worker for juno.com, an Internet service provider, as another employee, Matt Daly, sat checking his empty in-box.</p>
        <p>Workers at cyberrate.com, a retailing site, beckoned passers-by by flashing a strobe light and throwing T-shirts.</p>
        <p>Mariolene Jeanbaptiste, dressed as a big red bean, passed out temporary tattoos for beenz.com, an electronic commerce site.</p>
        <p>''They'll try anything,'' said Marion Rodgers, turning away from the big bean with a handful of tattoos. ''It's like when you go to the mall and all these people come up to you. I don't know why I would be surprised that Internet companies would be any different. Maybe because you never see real people on the Internet.''</p>
        <p>Certainly the paradox at hand -- that everybody there had left his home to visit a fair whose companies promise you won't have to because of the Internet -- was not lost on some people.</p>
        <p>''It would be interesting to see if they can have a virtual street fair some day,'' said Adrian Marsh, a  sophomore at New York University majoring in English who is thinking  of majoring in computer science. ''At least that way they would not have to worry about the weather.''</p>
        <p>Maybe next year, though organizers have more modest goals like using wireless modems next time, and, of course, drawing more companies. Laura Sabia of MarketMatch said she is working on creating similar fairs for other cities, like Boston and Washington.</p>
        <p>New York's fair was enough for Alan Barnes, 33, of Park Slope, Brooklyn. ''This place was as crowded and jumbled as the Internet,'' he said as he left empty-handed and walked into that century-old portal, the subway.</p>
