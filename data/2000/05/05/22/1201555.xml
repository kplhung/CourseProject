        <p>On Sept. 29, 1999, The Associated Press provided extensive evidence that G.I.'s killed a helpless group of civilians in the early days of the Korean War. Since then, its report of the incident at No Gun Ri, 17 months in the making, has became a media personality in its own right. It has been praised. It has been followed. It has been honored with journalism's top prizes. More recently, it has been pilloried.</p>
        <p>On May 12, 2000, U.S. News &amp; World Report published a 10-page report on its Web site, four weeks in the making, whose skeptical gist was summed up in the headline: ''Doubts About a Korean 'Massacre' '' followed by ''American Soldiers allegedly slaughtered hundreds of innocent refugees at a place called No Gun Ri. A new review of the facts challenges that claim.''</p>
        <p>Its work relied on archival documents and some interviews with the G.I.'s quoted by The Associated Press, many of whom, it said ''do not support the thesis of the A.P. story.''</p>
        <p>Have U.S. News and other critics seriously undermined A.P.'s report? Sorting through the various accounts offers a window on how news judgments about controversial events are made. The evidence available about No Gun Ri is sometimes contradictory, all the editors and reporters involved agree. What sets the accounts apart are editorial choices: How long the reporting should last; how many people should be interviewed, and in what depth; how to evaluate the relative importance of documents; and, when it comes to writing, how to frame the final account.</p>
        <p>Most of the world learned of No Gun Ri from A.P.'s report. It led to widespread coverage, which tended to emphasize the horror of the killings and the conflicted feelings of some G.I.'s about their role. Secretary of Defense William S. Cohen ordered an investigation of the accusations. Until then, the military had denied responsibility, rejecting the claims of South Koreans who sought reparations.</p>
        <p>In mid-April, the wire service's report was awarded this year's Pulitzer Prize for investigative reporting. Not long afterward, military affairs writers at three news organizations -- U.S. News, The Baltimore Sun and the military journalism Web site stripes.com -- began looking into the background of one of the A.P.'s sources, Edward L. Daily.</p>
        <p>This recent and skeptical coverage of No Gun Ri was set off and framed by documents that came to light indicating that Mr. Daily had embellished his military record and was not at No Gun Ri. Mr. Daily had told the A.P. and other news organizations that he had fired on the refugees under direct orders.</p>
        <p>On Friday, Seymour Topping, the administrator of the Pulitzer Prizes, said the Pulitzer board had re-examined and reaffirmed its award. ''The board has reviewed all the documentation and is up to date on all that has been published, he said. ''The board is taking no further action. There has been no expression of concern by any member of the board.''</p>
        <p>But the round of skeptical reports has left confusion about key questions in the case. Confusion, in fact, is to be expected when the source of information is memories and documents that date back half a century.</p>
        <p>''The problem with a story like this is, when all is said and done you have a lot of gray,'' said Tom Bowman, the military affairs reporter for The Sun, who was among those journalists pursuing the new evidence about Mr. Daily.</p>
        <p>Here are the the central questions involved in the report, and how various news organizations have handled them.</p>
        <p>The Events  Did G.I.'s Kill Civilians At No Gun Ri?</p>
        <p>The centerpiece of The A.P.'s findings was that these killings did occur, at the hands of young soldiers. In its original report, The A.P. said, ''six veterans of the 1st Cavalry Division said they fired on the refugee throng at the South Korean hamlet of No Gun Ri, and six others said they witnessed the mass killing.'' They went on to quote 9 of these 12.</p>
        <p>The U.S. News account said in its second paragraph, ''There is little doubt that something terrible did happen there, in the confusion of war some refugees were shot by American soldiers.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bowman said, ''Obviously Korean civilians died and U.S. soldiers are saying they shot them.''</p>
        <p>Defense Department officials on May 12 told The New York Times they had confirmed that United States troops had fired on unarmed civilians.</p>
        <p>Brian Duffy, the executive editor of U.S. News, said the magazine headline ''Doubts About a Korean 'Massacre' '' was not intended to undercut the evidence of civilian deaths, but to raise questions about the scope and circumstances of the incident.</p>
        <p>By the South Korean refugees' accounts, the shooting took place on and off for three days, beginning on July 26, 1950, in the early weeks of the Korean War. Some general facts are agreed upon by most witnesses. There had been a panicked retreat of American forces, including elements of the Seventh Cavalry Regiment, and they feared that the refugees had been infiltrated by North Korean soldiers.</p>
        <p>Several units, including H Company and F Company, regrouped near a railroad trestle where the main road curved underneath a railroad track. Refugees walking along the track were strafed by American planes. Looking for cover, the refugees ended up under the trestle.</p>
        <p>How many were killed there is a matter of dispute. The fourth paragraph of The A.P. report said: ''Ex-G.I.'s speak of 100, 200 or simply hundreds dead. The Koreans, whose claim for compensation was rejected last year, say 300 were shot to death at the bridge.''</p>
        <p>Later in the article, it again cited the Korean contentions, and added, ''Some ex-G.I.'s today estimate 100 or fewer were killed. But those close to the bridge,'' The A.P. said, ''generally put the total at about 200.''</p>
        <p>U.S. News reported that James Kerns, a member of H Company, 2nd Battalion -- the unit of men most directly involved -- ''sharply disputed the number of refugees in the tunnel.'' However, his estimate (he said ''there weren't over 125 people in there'') is within The A.P.'s range.</p>
        <p>Mr. Duffy said, ''If you read the A.P. account, it certainly leaves open the possibility that hundreds were dead.'' Mr. Kerns, he said, ''is disputing that possibility.''</p>
        <p>The Defense Department officials told The Times that hundreds were killed.</p>
        <p>The Witness  Was Daily Credible? Was He Even There?</p>
        <p>If the Koreans are the least visible witnesses in the American media, Edward L. Daily was easily the most visible.</p>
        <p>His remarks to The A.P. were vivid -- ''On summer nights, when the breeze is blowing, I can still hear their cries, the little kids screaming.'' Still, he was one of 50 sources, American and Korean, for the wire service; the factual points he made in the report were corroborated by other, named American sources.</p>
        <p>The NBC News program ''Dateline'' relied more heavily on Mr. Daily. The network's half-hour segment helped make the eloquent veteran the public face of G.I. guilt over No Gun Ri.</p>
        <p>This prominence, in turn, made it more likely that reporters would pay attention when told that Mr. Daily might never have been at No Gun Ri.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bowman; Joseph L. Galloway, the writer of the U.S. article; and Ed Offley, the Washington bureau chief of the stripes.com Web site discovered personnel records flatly contradicting Mr. Daily's assertions about his military service: that he was a prisoner of war, that he had received certain decorations, and, most importantly, that he served with H Company, the unit of the Seventh Cavalry Regiment directly involved in the No Gun Ri incident.</p>
        <p>How solid is the new evidence?</p>
        <p>It has raised serious doubts among some reporters who trusted Mr. Daily. He has responded to very few questioners. When Mr. Galloway reached him, Mr. Daily raised the possibility that his memory had been affected by emotional trauma or his antidepressant medication.</p>
        <p>Charles J. Hanley, one of the A.P. reporters, said he originally found Mr. Daily's accounts of events convincing, and trusted his documentary evidence: a driver's license placing him with the company in March 1950, a letter home naming his company commander, and an H Company ceremonial Christmas dinner menu from Dec. 25, 1949. Not until recently did Mr. Hanley get documentation of the conflicting personnel records.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hanley said this weekend: ''There is a discrepancy in the sketchy military record of one of our more than 40 sources. We are trying to get to the bottom of it. But this source provided no essential information for our report on No Gun Ri.''</p>
        <p>There is no question, however, that the newly discovered personnel records cast doubt on Mr. Daily's claims, not only about No Gun Ri but about his entire military career.</p>
        <p>How important is Mr. Daily? A.P.'s executive editor, Jonathan Wolman, said in a statement last week: ''Serious questions involve veteran Ed Daily. We spoke to soldiers who put him at the scene and have reviewed the documentation he offered for his role.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''If it turns out that he and those records deceived us, we will be extremely regretful, and saddened for him. But the tale of No Gun Ri does not fall on the words of Mr. Daily.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hanley points out that Mr. Daily is not quoted until the 56th paragraph of the original account. And he said that several other veterans confirmed the basic fact of the killing before Mr. Daily did.</p>
        <p>However Stephen G. Smith, the editor of U.S. News, describes Mr. Daily as ''the linchpin'' of the wire service's original report. ''He's the one who ties it all together,'' Mr. Smith said.</p>
        <p>Because the A.P. account depends on what Mr. Smith calls ''a mosaic of partial quotes,'' the fact that Mr. Daily's three quotes were vivid, full sentences dealing with the event, the orders and the veterans' feelings of guilt made him more crucial that the other veterans interviewed, Mr. Smith said.</p>
        <p>Few of those skeptical of the overall report mention the South Korean witnesses, who are also quoted at some length.</p>
        <p>Most of these South Koreans are seeking reparations, a fact mentioned with some irritation by two veterans interviewed by The Times last week. Few journalists have reinterviewed the South Koreans.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hanley bristles at the idea that their quest for reparations casts doubt on their memories. ''Frankly,'' he said, ''it is analogous to questioning the right of Holocaust victims to seek some token of reparation.''</p>
        <p>The Rules  Amid Fear, Were There Orders to Kill?</p>
        <p>Aside from being the public face of No Gun Ri, Mr. Daily is also one of three former soldiers who tell the A.P. -- either in the original report or in a video on the wire service's Web site -- that their commanders on the scene ordered them to fire. He told the A.P.: ''The command looked at it as getting rid of the problem in the easier way. That was to shoot them in a a group.''</p>
        <p>The issue of orders is crucial to determining whether the killings were simply lethal overreaction by young soldiers scared that enemy troops were hidden among the civilians, or whether they constituted a war crime.</p>
        <p>A second soldier from H Company, Eugene Hesselman, was quoted as saying that the company commander, Capt. Melbourne C. Chandler, had said: ''To hell with all those people. Let's get rid of all of them.''</p>
        <p>U.S. News points out that H Company's morning report for July 27, the summary of a unit's activity the day before, listed Mr. Hesselman as having been wounded on July 26. But its attempts to reach Mr. Hesselman proved unsuccessful. Mr. Hesselman, in an interview long before the name of No Gun Ri was widely known, had told The A.P. that he had a small shrapnel wound and declined to be evacuated.</p>
        <p>Mr. Galloway, however, said that the medical battalion's morning reports indicated that Mr. Hesselman had been evacuated to the medical unit on July 26, the day of the massacre. However, the morning report of July 27 does not indicate when that transfer occurred -- before or after the shooting, before or after any order might have been given.</p>
        <p>The third veteran to mention orders, George Preece, does so in a videotaped interview with Mr. Hanley. In an interview with The Lexington, Ky., Herald-Leader days after the A.P. released its original report on Sept. 29, Mr. Preece retracted the statement and has since denied that any orders were given.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Hanley said on Friday that he now has interviews with 10 former G.I.'s confirming that there were direct orders. As for the retractions and rollbacks of some veterans on the details or even the existence of the killings, Mr. Hanley said he believed that they had come under pressure from fellow veterans, or were worried about possible war-crimes charges.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hanley also points out that no veteran came to A.P. volunteering information for the original article.</p>
        <p>He said, ''these guys were called cold,'' and remembered details of the events that in many cases matched the details the South Koreans had given.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hanley also says that arguments about on-the-scene orders overlook two general orders from top commanders. The First Cavalry Division headquarters on July 24 had issued an order saying: ''No refugees to cross the front line. Fire everyone trying to cross lines. Use discretion in case of women and children.''</p>
        <p>U.S. News made no reference to these general orders.</p>
        <p>Asked if he would frame his account differently if he had to do it again, Mr. Galloway replied: ''If I had time to do the other interviews and sit back and ponder, I might have written it differently. But still, as it stands, not bad. I think we did a good job in the time that we had. I stand behind it. I think in the end, when the investigation is over and done, there will be a lot more holes shot in the A.P. story.''</p>
        <p>Asked what he meant by ''in the time we had,'' Mr. Galloway said he was trying to get his piece published before Mr. Offley and Mr. Bowman.</p>
        <p>But in the end, the crucial centerpiece of The A.P. report, the American soldiers killed at least 100 Korean civilians -- possibly under direct orders -- has been chipped but hardly shattered by the latest revelations.</p>
        <p>Herman Patterson, a rifleman in the 2nd Battalion, said in an interview with The Times last week: ''Unfortunately, the incident took place. Numbers are not known exactly.''</p>
