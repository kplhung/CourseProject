        <p>Bradford College, a small liberal arts school that had been struggling to find a niche since becoming a four-year coeducational institution a generation ago, died today after a bittersweet commencement ceremony that drew hundreds of alumni from around the country.

        <p>Officials said the cause was a simple failure to find enough students to cover operating costs, though many blame mismanagement and weak marketing.

        <p>Bradford College, a small liberal arts school that had been struggling to find a niche since becoming a four-year coeducational institution a generation ago, died today after a bittersweet commencement ceremony that drew hundreds of alumni from around the country. It was 197 years old.</p>
        <p>Officials said the cause was a simple failure to find enough students to cover operating costs, though many blame mismanagement and weak marketing. As with a patient with a battered immune system who succumbs to pneumonia, Bradford's demise was sealed when enrollment fell short of expectations last fall by just 31 students, but it probably had been inevitable at least since the college decided in 1996 to borrow $18 million to build new dormitories.</p>
        <p>''You have to change to survive,'' said Karen M. Shugrue, a 1970 graduate who heads the board of trustees. ''Bradford has always done that -- has always somehow managed, until now, to change and survive.''</p>
        <p>With its grand red-brick buildings around a grassy quadrangle and a wooden bridge arcing over Tupelo Pond, Bradford is the quintessential picture of a New England college campus, and has long been the cultural heart of this historic working-class community, 35 miles northeast of Boston.</p>
        <p>It was founded in 1803 as one of the first girls' schools in New England and in 1932 became a two-year college serving the daughters of the well-to-do. Four decades later, at the height of the Vietnam War, Bradford admitted men and began granting bachelor's degrees; since then, the college has been on the cutting edge of liberal arts education, offering tiny student-faculty ratios, innovative teaching and an emphasis on internships and community service.</p>
        <p>In the increasingly competitive college market, Bradford has been in a seemingly endless process of self-reinvention, catering to artists, international students, the learning disabled. But with fewer than 600 full-time students, the bulk of them lured to campus with generous discounts off the $25,000 sticker price, the college ran yawning deficits.</p>
        <p>While elite liberal arts colleges like Amherst in Massachusetts and Oberlin in Ohio are thriving, higher education has shifted its overall focus to professional training, leaving smaller, lesser-known schools like Bradford in danger. In 1960, about half the nation's students were at liberal arts colleges; today, about 17 percent are. Since 1986, more than 40 such institutions have shut their doors, but none were as old or respected in academic circles as Bradford.</p>
        <p>''It's profoundly sad for all of us,'' Arthur C. Levine, president of Teachers College at Columbia University and a former president of Bradford, said in the final commencement address today. ''For our nation, it's a tragedy when small colleges, which know their students by name and character, give way to megaversities and online campuses that know them by Social Security numbers or U.R.L.'s.''</p>
        <p>Today's ceremony was more Irish wake than funeral, as graduates celebrated their successes through tears, and alumnae from a half-century ago joked about reconvening if the college was converted into a retirement home. The 25-acre campus, which has 19 buildings -- from the 17th-century tavern where the school was conceived to the new complex of town houses that brought it to the brink of bankruptcy -- is on the market, and though schools have come shopping, none have made a bid.</p>
        <p>Bradford's e-mail network and mailing address will be defunct by month's end, its transcripts sent to nearby Merrimack College, the $20 million endowment in the hands of the state attorney general. The fate of other assets -- the 36-foot mural of Bradford's history painted a decade ago; the trowel used to lay the cornerstone of Academy Hall, the campus centerpiece, in 1870; countless old bows and arrows, snowshoes, tennis rackets and posture trophies in the former gym -- remains unclear.</p>
        <p>''You mourn the 200-year tradition, obviously,'' said David Crouse, a 1990 graduate who returned to teach writing five years ago. ''But a lot of my mourning is about the possibilities. We were on the verge of great things.''</p>
        <p>Since the closing was announced on Nov. 23, the campuswide strategic planning process has been replaced with talk of transfer applications and job interviews.</p>
        <p>Students and faculty have cycled through the stages of grief: angry protests under desperate ''Save Bradford'' banners; a futile effort to raise $20 million, which netted several thousand in pledges; a steady march of farewell parties; and throughout, an attempt at teaching and learning, tests and projects, even the annual faculty-senior softball game, as the college ran out of basic supplies like light bulbs and paper.</p>
        <p>''It's like purgatory,'' Marc Mannheimer, an art professor for the past 21 years, said in an interview the day after classes ended. ''Every day, I say to myself, 'This is the last time I'll do this.' ''</p>
        <p>Bradford is survived by 6,711 alumni, 497 students (131 of whom received diplomas today), 33 full-time professors and 121 staff members. It was preceded in death by the renowned writer Andre Dubus, who taught at the college for 18 years, and Portia Marshall Washington Pittman, the daughter of Booker T. Washington, who graduated in 1905.</p>
        <p>As they milled about outside the white commencement tent, generations of former students reminisced about gooey chocolate Bradford cake (which was served at the alumni reception), singing holiday songs by candlelight on the steps of Academy Hall, jumping in the pond when classes were canceled on the annual Spring Day. Singing the alma mater for an institution founded when Thomas Jefferson was president, they wondered what it would mean to have a diploma from a place that no longer existed.</p>
        <p>Nancy Jordan Gabrielson, a 1945 graduate who lives in Philadelphia, said Dorothy M. Bell, Bradford's president for 27 years, always told her ''the one thing you can count on in life, that's change.''</p>
        <p>''But we didn't expect it here,'' said Mrs. Gabrielson's classmate, Muriel Horne Weldon, who wore her monogrammed green Bradford scarf. ''That is, not in this form. They changed their thinking. They added buildings, added students. But it was still supposed to be here forever.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 25, 2000, Thursday  An article on Monday about the closing of Bradford College in Hav erhill, Mass., cited an estimate erroneously for the drop since 1960 in the percentage of students attending liberal arts colleges. Although the percentage has declined, precise figures are not available.</p>
