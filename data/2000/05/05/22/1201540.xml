        <p>Mary Higgins Clark, the blockbuster mystery writer who lives in a mansion in Saddle River, N.J., and a Manhattan apartment with commanding views of Central Park, grew up in the Bronx, off Pelham Parkway. Her father owned a bar, called Higgins Bar and Grille, and he died suddenly one Sunday morning while she was at church.</p>
        <p>''At the time, my mother had a total of $2,000 and three kids,'' Ms. Clark said in a recent interview in her pied-a-terre on Central Park South, an emerald the size of a Chiclet on the third finger of her left hand and an oil portrait of herself in rich pastels on the wall behind her.</p>
        <p>Ms. Clark's mother, to make ends meet, rented out rooms. ''She put up a sign that said, 'Furnished rooms, kitchen privileges,' '' Ms. Clark said. ''But the neighbors thought the second phrase brought down the tone of the neighborhood, so they asked my mother to cut it off the sign. So she did. She was terribly enterprising.''</p>
        <p>While Ms. Clark, 72, has not lost the Bronx-Irish lilt to her voice or her love of Irish jokes (A favorite: ''You know how an Irishman proposes? 'Nora, would you care to be buried with my mother?' ''), she has come a long way from those early Bronx days. Her latest contract with Simon &amp; Schuster, announced last month, is believed to be a record-breaker.</p>
        <p>At five books for a total advance of $64 million, the contract made her the highest-paid female author in the world, per book, according to most industry estimates.</p>
        <p>Beyond the numbers, Ms. Clark is in some ways an intriguing experiment for Simon &amp; Schuster. Though the publishing house, a unit of Viacom, says the author's possible appeal in the digital world was not a factor in the negotiations, the company this week will release the electronic version of ''Before I Say Good-Bye'' -- her newest best seller -- and nine of her other books in electronic versions that will be available for laptops and desktop computers, electronic reading devices and personal digital assistants.</p>
        <p>It is not yet clear if the mass market will find e-books approachable. But Ms. Clark is a proven weapon. Her 22 hardcover books -- usually critically unacclaimed mysteries that feature heroines through whom housewives around the world can live out fears and fantasies -- have all been best sellers. Her first suspense novel, ''Where Are the Children?'' published in 1975, has gone into 70 printings and has sold too many millions of copies for her agent or publisher to estimate. By 2005, Ms. Clark will have received $160 million from Simon &amp; Schuster.</p>
        <p>Jack Romanos, president and chief operating officer of Simon &amp; Schuster, said that as mass-market paperback sales atrophy across the industry, one way to reconnect with readers may be to make a mass-market author like Ms. Clark available in electronic formats.</p>
        <p>''I think, No. 1, if you ask anybody our goal in the next few years it is going to be to intelligently guide the predominantly print-oriented consumer publishing company into the electronic, digital publishing world that's around the corner,'' Mr. Romanos said. ''The potential for the digital future still comes back to words. The book may have just been a container. And we may now have to try to reach readers on a screen, not in a book.''</p>
        <p>Sales of mass-market paperbacks -- a medium in which the entire Clark canon has traditionally been available -- are suffering across the industry, which is struggling to reconcile its musty, old-fashioned medium with the copyright and distribution issues of the electronic and digital era.</p>
        <p>''The core audience for the mass-market paperback is shrinking, and that is something we have to think about every day,'' Mr. Romanos said. ''The baby boomers, the 'paperback in your back pocket' people of the 1960's and 1970's, are now older and more affluent and are buying hardcovers and walking around with reading glasses in their back pockets. And that is coupled with the fact that we are losing ground to the electronic media, which young people are turning to for their leisure time.''</p>
        <p>And Simon &amp; Schuster itself is also in a state of transition. In 1998, Viacom sold the publishing house's highly profitable textbook and reference division to Pearson for $4.6 billion. And over the coming year, the remaining part of Simon &amp; Schuster, its trade-book division, will be absorbed into the larger corporate structure of the merged Viacom and CBS and will become an even smaller slice of the corporate pie.</p>
        <p>The new contract gives Ms. Clark advances of $15 million each for four mysteries, and $4 million for a memoir, which is to be published in 2001 and which she has tentatively titled ''Kitchen Privileges'' in homage to her mother. (Her last deal, in 1996, was for three books at $36 million, or $12 million each.)</p>
        <p>Her editor, Michael Korda, and her agent, Eugene Winick of McIntosh &amp; Otis, both said that Ms. Clark made money for Simon &amp; Schuster above and beyond what it paid her. But other editors and executives at Simon &amp; Schuster said she was considered more of a break-even author  whose best sellers help ease the rest of the Simon &amp; Schuster list into bookstores.</p>
        <p>Each of Ms. Clark's books sells about 700,000 hardcover copies, which retail for $29 and on which she earns as much as a 15 percent royalty, and about 1.5 million paperbacks at $7.99 with a 10 percent royalty.</p>
        <p>Because publishers do not release sales figures, it is impossible to gauge how much she contributes to Simon &amp; Schuster's bottom line. One factor that adds to Ms. Clark's value is what is, to some, her mystifying popularity overseas: she is, for example, the best-selling fiction author in France, where the paperback rights to her books regularly sell for more than 3 million francs (about $420,000), said a foreign publishing scout based in New York who is acquainted with her French contracts. Simon &amp; Schuster retains world rights to her novels, and sells foreign rights in individual countries like the Netherlands, Italy, Britain and Germany, countries where she is also very popular.</p>
        <p>John Baker, the editorial director of Publishers Weekly, the trade journal, compared her books' popularity with foreign readers to Sylvester Stallone movies that fare poorly in the United States but generate substantial income in foreign markets.</p>
        <p>''For authors who are enormously successful but generally critically spurned, as I am afraid poor Mary tends to be, there is a lot of money to be made overseas,'' Mr. Baker said. ''I mean, they name streets after her in France. It's a sort of Jerry Lewis syndrome, I think.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Clark's new books also can  spur sales of her backlisted books around Mother's Day each year, when her novels are published. Unlike some other blockbuster authors like Patricia Cornwell, for example, who have switched publishing houses during their careers -- all her books are under one roof.</p>
        <p>The one area in which Ms. Clark makes very little money, compared to blockbuster authors like John Grisham or Stephen King, is in movies or television.</p>
        <p>Mr. Baker said Ms. Clark's books are neither violent enough nor sexy enough for Hollywood.</p>
        <p>''Her audience is romance readers who want a little suspense thrown in,'' he said. ''They are not teenaged boys, which seems to be the Hollywood market these days.''</p>
        <p>As for the future, given the vagaries, opportunities and threat of the digital world, a traditional publishing company may be happy to know that at least one of its blockbuster authors will be sticking around for at least another half-decade.</p>
        <p>David Gernert, the agent and editor for Mr. Grisham, who is published by Doubleday, said: ''In five years, a Clancy or a King or a Grisham could walk up and say to their traditional publisher, 'I'm going to publish my own books on the Web and I'm going to charge $20 a copy and of that $20 I will take home $18.' Well, that's a little different from the model that book publishers are offering. There's nothing like a long-term contract, because the future is a little uncertain.''</p>
        <p>There is usually little left to uncertainty in a typical Clark book. They  usually follow a sleuthing protagonist -- always a self-made woman with a career that lends itself to investigation, like an attorney, television producer or reporter -- as a mystery, such as a murder, a kidnapping or a bomb investigation, unfolds around her.</p>
        <p>There is a symmetry between her plots and her own self-made life.</p>
        <p>''There is in each book a heroine, and there are certain similarities to what we know about Mary,'' said Mr.  Korda.</p>
        <p>After attending secretarial school, Ms. Clark worked as a secretary and then as a Pan Am stewardess before marrying a childhood neighbor, Warren Clark.</p>
        <p>She sold her first short story when she was 29, but interrupted her writing to raise her children. Her husband -- who had a heart condition that made him uninsurable -- died when Ms. Clark was 37, leaving her with five children. She went to work writing radio scripts to support the family, and rose at 5 a.m. every day to work on a novel. (She remarried several years ago.)</p>
        <p>She sold her first suspense novel in 1975 for $3,000. For her second in 1977, she got more than $1 million for all the rights, and the first thing she did was buy a Cadillac to replace an Oldsmobile with 146,000 miles on the odometer. Ms. Clark returned to school and graduated from Fordham University in 1979. The university gave her an honorary doctorate in 1998.</p>
        <p>Ms. Clark said the secret to her novels was that she explored the fears of regular women, and used her heroines to reconcile those fears.</p>
        <p>''My people are never looking for trouble,'' she said. ''The example I use is this: a young woman is in a see-through blouse and a black leather miniskirt and walks along Ninth Avenue at three in the morning. Something happens to her, You say, 'My goodness, that is terrible.'</p>
        <p>''On the other hand, if you take the same young woman, and she's in her home, and she looks at her watch and says, 'Oh gosh, it's time to pick up the baby from Mother's,' and she gets in the car and at the end of the driveway, from the floor of the back seat someone says, 'Don't turn right, dear. Turn left,' then she is your sister or your daughter and you become emotionally involved in it. I write about nice people whose lives are in danger.''</p>
