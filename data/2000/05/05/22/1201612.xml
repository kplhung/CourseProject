        <p>The Democratic speaker of the State Assembly moved closer to quelling a rebellion within his chamber today as he reached a truce with one of his main political rivals.</p>
        <p>The pact between the speaker, Sheldon Silver of Manhattan, and Thomas J. Manton, the Democratic leader of Queens, removes one of the final threats to Mr. Silver's continued control of the Assembly.</p>
        <p>Over the last few days, Mr. Silver has struggled to put down a revolt that erupted last week when the second-ranking member, Michael J. Bragman, announced that he would seek to overthrow the speaker.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silver's attempts to quell the dissent have been severely hampered by Mr. Manton, who has been working quietly to encourage the Assembly's influential Queens delegation to join Mr. Bragman.</p>
        <p>Mr. Manton, whose feud with Mr. Silver goes back years, had recently become incensed that Mr. Silver had inserted himself into a Queens dispute that many borough leaders felt did not concern him.</p>
        <p>But late this afternoon, Mr. Silver and Mr. Manton released a joint statement that said: ''In the interest of a unified Democratic Party in New York State, we have begun a new partnership that will move our party forward. This new era of good will begins with support for Sheldon Silver as speaker of the New York State Assembly.''</p>
        <p>In an interview tonight, Mr. Bragman, an assemblyman from the Syracuse area, expressed disappointment with Mr. Manton's decision. He said he would have to reconsider whether he had enough support in the Assembly to drive Mr. Silver from power. ''I don't know what is going to happen,'' he said, adding that he still had considerable support in the Assembly.</p>
        <p>The chamber dissolved into chaos on Thursday when Mr. Bragman announced that he would try to topple Mr. Silver in a showdown vote on Monday. The speaker retaliated immediately, stripping Mr. Bragman of his title of majority leader and cutting his pay.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silver also demoted two high-ranking lawmakers who openly sided with Mr. Bragman, and he called on powerful union leaders and party officials to discourage any other Democrats in the Assembly from joining him. Mr. Silver also made it clear that he would punish any member who defied him.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Bragman has refused to back down, setting the stage for what appeared to be a major fight on Monday among the 98 Democrats who make up the majority party in the Assembly. Mr. Bragman needs at least 50 Democrats to topple Mr. Silver. But even if he cannot gather that many votes, he may still have enough support to make it difficult for Mr. Silver to control the house as firmly as he has.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bragman is one of the few members in the Assembly who can make a major challenge to the speaker. Like Mr. Silver, he has broad support and is a highly effective fund-raiser.</p>
        <p>The support that Mr. Bragman had from Mr. Manton was considered crucial. Mr. Manton, one of Mr. Silver's most bitter adversaries, recently promised to deliver most of Queens' 16 Assembly members to Mr. Bragman, provided that his challenge to the speaker would be a swift one.</p>
        <p>Mr. Manton moved against Mr. Silver after learning that he had encouraged Walter F. McCaffrey, a New York City councilman, to make a primary challenge against United States Representative Joseph Crowley of Queens, who is up for re-election this year. Mr. Crowley is a close ally of Mr. Manton's, and Mr. Silver's actions were largely viewed as an affront to Mr. Manton.</p>
        <p>But as part of the truce that the two men reached today, Mr. Silver agreed to support Mr. Crowley publicly for another term in Congress, according to people involved in the negotiations. In return, Mr. Manton agreed to rally the entire Queens delegation behind Mr. Silver.</p>
        <p>Mr. Silver has already secured the support of Herman D. Farrell Jr., the Democratic Party chairman in Manhattan; Clarence Norman Jr., the Democratic Party chairman in Brooklyn; and Roberto Ramirez, the Democratic Party chairman in the Bronx. Together, they lead more than 40 Assembly members.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bragman, for his part, lashed out at Mr. Silver tonight, accusing him of engaging in a ruthless campaign of intimidation that led many  lawmakers to abandon the coup attempt.</p>
        <p>''There are still at least 30 members who are willing to lose everything and go forward with me,'' he said. ''I don't know if I want them to do that.'' Mr. Bragman added that no matter what happens next, ''change and reform are inevitable now'' in the Assembly.</p>
