        <p>When President Clinton annointed the leaders of Ethiopia and Eritrea as princes of an African Renaissance two years ago, he and three of his aides took a special interest in trying to head off one of the continent's biggest and costliest wars.</p>
        <p>The behind-the-scenes courting of the Ethiopian Prime Minister, Meles Zenawi, and the Eritrean President, Isaias Afewerki, ended in bitter disappointment 10 days ago when Ethiopia rolled into Eritrea with tanks and artillery and launched trench warfare reminiscent of World War I.</p>
        <p>The latest offensive was taken after two years in which both countries, among the poorest on earth, spent more than $1 billion on arms. But in trying to forge a peace settlement, the administration never sought economic or arms sanctions. Nor did it seek to slow down more than $1 billion in World Bank loans in the same period.</p>
        <p>Instead, it focused on an intensive and sometimes highly personal diplomatic maneuver. At times, the diplomats involved said, Mr. Clinton himself phoned the two leaders and wrote them letters trying to coax them away from battle and into peace talks that could have been held in the United States.</p>
        <p>A last-second maneuver this month by a team of United Nations ambassadors who knew the fighting was imminent because blood plasma had just been shipped to the front also failed.</p>
        <p>The weapons pouring into the region -- fighter planes and helicopters, tanks, howitzers, shoulder-to-air missiles, and ammunition from Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Romania, China and North Korea -- were easy for Western intelligence agencies to see as they entered Eritrea by sea and Ethiopia overland from Djibouti, by rail.</p>
        <p>But the three Clinton administration diplomats who headed the peace effort -- Anthony Lake, a former National Security Agency adviser to Mr. Clinton; Gayle E. Smith, the director for Africa at the agency; and Susan E. Rice, the assistant secretary of state for African affairs -- acknowledge that they were reluctant to chastise the two African leaders.</p>
        <p>Former guerrilla leaders who once fought together, Mr. Zenawi and Mr. Afewerki were seen as friends of the United States, men who had promise as reformers, despite their drive to fight each other. They led countries at the bottom of the economic ladder: it seemed heartless to be too tough. And they were considered useful in the administration's efforts to curb the power of the Islamic leadership in Sudan, a government that Mr. Zenawi and Mr. Afewerki opposed.</p>
        <p>Now, as 10 days of fighting have dislodged hundreds of thousands of people from their homes in Eritrea and killed unknown numbers of front-line conscripts, the United Nations Security Council has approved a weapons embargo at the urging of the United States.</p>
        <p>As the Ethiopians step up their assault by bombing targets near Eritrean Red Sea ports, the diplomats say they are still talking to both sides. But they are also considering  more severe sanctions, like limiting the ability of the Eritreans to collect remittances from friends and relatives in the United States and restricting international flights of Ethiopian Airlines, a major revenue earner.</p>
        <p>In an interview, Ms. Rice said ''different sanctions'' were considered at different points.</p>
        <p>But she said, ''It was our view given the disposition and the psychology of the two governments and the two peoples that external pressure was more likely to drive them in the opposite direction than the desired direction.'' It was decided to ''resort to those pressures only in extremis.''</p>
        <p>Last October, as the weapons buildup became impossible to ignore, Mr. Lake said there were suggestions to seek an arms embargo. But Mr. Lake said he remained convinced that an arms embargo would have thrown the two countries into war. Mr. Zenawi and Mr. Afewerki had asserted that an arms embargo would bring about a collapse of the peace talks, making war much more likely, Mr. Lake said.</p>
        <p>Critics of the policy say it was much too soft. ''We should look them in the eyes and growl,'' said Chester A. Crocker, a former assistant secretary of state for African affairs. ''They would blink if they thought we were going to shut them down with the World Bank. We have the power to come down hard on the leadership. No one laid our glove publicly on either of them.''</p>
        <p>Given the poverty -- and now the shortage of food that has struck both countries -- the governments have spent staggering amounts of money on weapons in the last two years, according to figures from the Institute for International Strategic Studies in London. Ethiopia, a country of 60 million, spent $480 million on arms in 1999; Eritrea, a nation of 3 million, spent $306 million. They spent slightly smaller amounts in 1998.</p>
        <p>This year, Ethiopia's defense budget is set to rise to $533 million. Yet before the first outbreak of war in 1998, Ethiopia's defense budget was a little more than $100 million, the institute said.</p>
        <p>In the last four years, Ethiopia received $924.9 million from the World Bank, more than two-thirds of it in 1998 after a first round of fighting, according to the World Bank. Eritrea, a much smaller country, received less.</p>
        <p>The World Bank never threatened to stop the money, bank officials said, although Ethiopia lost its program with the International Monetary Fund because of excessive military spending.</p>
        <p>As well, the Eritrean leader, Mr. Afewerki has been able to complement the foreign aid money by raising funds from the very loyal Eritrean diaspora in the United States. In early March, Mr. Afewerki addressed more than 10,000 Eritreans at the Equestrian Center in Upper Marlboro, Md., and many of them gave generously to his war machine.</p>
        <p>The three negotiators who squared off with the African leaders, who turned out to be less princes of reform than warriors for personal honor, were eclectic, each with a point of view.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lake, 61, who specialized in Africa as a university student and wrote his doctoral dissertation on Rhodesia, carried the weight of a professional diplomat. Ms. Smith, 44, once a freelance journalist who was on friendly terms with the two leaders from the 1970's and 1980's when she wrote about them from behind the lines, conveyed intimate knowledge of the region's clans and personalities. Ms. Rice, 35, an African-American who has the confidence of Secretary of State, Madeleine K. Albright, carried the authority of that office.</p>
        <p>The current fighting represents the third and most expansive phase of the battle between the two countries. The State Department's best guess is that 50,000 to 60,000 people were killed in the first two rounds in the last two years, officials said. The death toll this time could be even higher, they said.</p>
        <p>On the face of it, the dispute is about territory around a border between Eritrea and Ethiopia. Eritrea says it was reclaiming its own land when it marched over the line in May 1998; Ethiopia says it must have the territory back before it will agree to a comprehensive peace agreement.</p>
        <p>As both leaders amassed their huge arsenals and conscripted wave upon wave of peasants, teachers, engineers and doctors, they were summoned to negotiations in Algiers earlier this month.</p>
        <p>There, the talks were convened under the umbrella of the Organization for African Unity, but atmospherics were sour. The two men walked away, determined to go to war, just as they had been at various points all along, officials said.</p>
        <p>When a group of United Nations ambassadors, including the American envoy, Richard C. Holbrooke, heard that the countdown for war was under way, they rushed from central Africa northward to see if they could make a difference.</p>
        <p>But the envoys found Mr. Meles and Mr. Afewerki impervious to arguments about how they risked the lives of tens of thousands of their citizens and the viability of their fledgling countries.</p>
        <p>As the ambassadors left, war broke out, making clear that Mr. Clinton's speechwriters, who chose to compare Mr. Meles and Mr. Afewerki to Renaissance leaders, may have unwittingly been correct. The Renaissance, several Africa hands noted, ended in bloody wars too.</p>
