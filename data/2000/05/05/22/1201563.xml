        <p>As President Clinton prepares to visit Moscow next month, there are disquieting signs that Russia's new president, Vladimir Putin, is steering the Kremlin toward anti-democratic policies. A government raid on a private media company earlier this month and Moscow's recent welcome for Yugoslavia's defense minister, who has been indicted for war crimes, suggest a contempt for democratic values that Mr. Clinton and his aides must consider as they plan for the Moscow summit meeting.</p>
        <p>It is possible that the police raid on the offices of Media-MOST and the defense minister's visit were tactical maneuvers designed to placate some of Mr. Putin's conservative political allies rather than a signal of new policies. Even so, Mr. Putin must have understood that the steps would send a chilling message in the first days of his presidency.</p>
        <p>The government defended the crude search of Media-MOST headquarters as necessary to gather information for a criminal investigation of suspected financial irregularities at the company. Mr. Putin himself echoed that view when he endorsed the police action, while affirming his support for a free press. But it is difficult to believe that the arrival of masked agents with automatic weapons was not an effort to intimidate an enterprise whose publications and broadcast outlets have been critical of Mr. Putin and his prosecution of the war in Chechnya.</p>
        <p>By hosting Dragoljub Ojdanic, Belgrade's defense minister and a loyal ally of Slobodan Milosevic, the Yugoslav president, Moscow defied the war crimes tribunal in The Hague, which was established by the United Nations Security Council to deal with atrocities in the recent Balkan ethnic conflicts. Mr. Ojdanic was army chief of staff during the war in Kosovo. The tribunal last May charged him and other Yugoslav leaders with responsibility for the deportation of hundreds of thousands of ethnic Albanians and the murder of hundreds of others.</p>
        <p>As a member state of the U.N., Russia had an obligation to detain Mr. Ojdanic so he could be brought to trial. Instead, he met with Russian defense officials and moved freely through Moscow during a five-day visit that coincided with Mr. Putin's inauguration. Last week, after a visit by Belgrade's foreign minister, Moscow granted Yugoslavia a $102 million loan. Mr. Putin may be playing to nationalist and Slavic sentiment in Russia with his embrace of Belgrade, but these steps are a direct slap at Washington.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's advisers talk about the coming summit meeting as an opportunity to take the measure of Mr. Putin, and a chance to explore a broad agenda of common interests. The Russian leader may turn out to be a pragmatic negotiator. Certainly he is more energetic and more familiar with policy details than his predecessor, Boris Yeltsin. On economic issues, he seems inclined to spur reform. But on such critical issues as respect for democratic principles, Mr. Putin has not made a promising start.</p>
