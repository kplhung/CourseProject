        <p>Kevin McKenzie's new staging of ''Swan Lake'' for American Ballet Theater is the blockbuster production of the dance season, and all its new and traditional components fell into place on Saturday night. Nina Ananiashvili and Julio Bocca galvanized the company with their hair-raisingly brilliant and deep performance, whipping the audience at the Metropolitan Opera House into a frenzied ovation.</p>
        <p>Amid all the conceptual and reconsidered productions of ''Swan Lake'' (some fine, some not) this is the one to take the children to. Mr. McKenzie has a few surprises and changes, but his springboard is the standard 1895 version of Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov. Like the 1967 ''Swan Lake'' staged by David Blair that was a longtime staple at Ballet Theater, this version has no dark psychological twist and tells a story straight. Odette, turned into a swan by the evil magician von Rothbart, is betrayed by Prince Siegfried; he can turn her back into a maiden with true love but is seduced instead by Odile, Rothbart's daughter.</p>

        <p>Kevin McKenzie's new staging of ''Swan Lake'' for American Ballet Theater is the blockbuster production of the dance season, and all its new and traditional components fell into place on Saturday night. Nina Ananiashvili and Julio Bocca galvanized the company with their hair-raisingly brilliant and deep performance, whipping the audience at the Metropolitan Opera House into a frenzied ovation.</p>
        <p>Amid all the conceptual and reconsidered productions of ''Swan Lake'' (some fine, some not) this is the one to take the children to. Mr. McKenzie has a few surprises and changes, but his springboard is the standard 1895 version of Marius Petipa and Lev Ivanov. Like the 1967 ''Swan Lake'' staged by David Blair that was a longtime staple at Ballet Theater, this version has no dark psychological twist and tells a story straight. Odette, turned into a swan by the evil magician von Rothbart, is betrayed by Prince Siegfried; he can turn her back into a maiden with true love but is seduced instead by Odile, Rothbart's daughter.</p>
        <p>No one, however, goes to ''Swan Lake'' for just the story. The sheer opera-house spectacle of this version is already a hit with the audience. Zack Brown's sets and costumes, heavy on shades of blue or gold, evoke a rich Renaissance court at a lakeside castle, very Swiss or German, depending on your travels.</p>
        <p>When Siegfried swears to marry Odile, the ballroom's brocade walls give way to a rosy dawn (lighting by Duane Schuler) behind the forest in which Siegfried met Odette. Rothbart, a sinister courtier in Act III, is suddenly replaced by another dancer, the near-naked nature deity with ram's horns who opens the ballet in the prologue.</p>
        <p>The New York premiere of this ''Swan Lake'' on Friday night was led by Susan Jaffe and Jose Manuel Carreno. Like Ashley Tuttle, who led the cast on Saturday afternoon with Angel Corella, they have not recovered from recent injuries. To say the ballerinas were not at their best (neither completed the fouettes) is an understatement.</p>
        <p>It took Ms. Ananiashvili's dancing, stunning in its physical power and projecting emotion through sheer technique, to give the full measure of this production. It took Mr. Bocca, who found some of the choreography in Mr. McKenzie's new solos for the prince as illogical as did his colleagues, to make sense of the prince's role. He pulled it dramatically together.</p>
        <p>Emotion is the clue to this ''Swan Lake'' and if one looks carefully, Mr. McKenzie's details add up to a coherent tale. This prince is a playboy. In Act I, the waltz choreographed by Mr. McKenzie draws him in. His new solo is part of this dance and he fancies several women.</p>
        <p>The Polonaise at the end of the act is danced by peasants who are clearly in their cups: a tipsy girl falls down. All is fresh with springtime (the usual Maypole is included) until the queen mother tells the prince to marry. The brooding solo that other productions sometimes include is here danced by Siegfried, surrounded by couples who are in love.</p>
        <p>Odette is first seen in the new prologue as a maiden. Rothbart, in a cape with slimy green leaves and a padded leotard that makes him look muscular and grotesque, steps back and another dancer portrays him in noble guise.</p>
        <p>Bowing and gallant, he grabs Odette in a tight embrace. Vladimir Malakhov and Ms. Jaffe were locked in the most erotic image. Marcelo Gomes on Saturday afternoon was more brutal with Ms. Tuttle, who had innocently placed her hands on his chest. Maxim Belotserkovsky and Ms. Ananiashvili offered a desperate struggle full of flying lifts. Suddenly the horned Rothbart steps forward with a realistic flapping swan in his arms. Brian Reeder, magnificent on Friday, caressed the toy swan in a chilling manner; John Gardner was more straightforward on Saturday afternoon.</p>
        <p>Essentially Mr. McKenzie has kept the set pieces of the 1895 version in Act II and III although some of the swan corps is in new and asymmetrical formations.</p>
        <p>The radical shortening of Act IV makes short shrift of the storm scene, performed during a set change and a short farewell duet leads quickly into the ensemble. Rothbart is defeated by the double suicide of Odette and Siegfried from a rocky cliff with ruins. The one jarring note is the Disneyesque sun within which Odette and Siegfried find love in death.</p>
        <p>There is only one intermission, which moves things along, although Mr. McKenzie has added new dances. He has also restored some of Tschaikovsky's 1887 score for the first Moscow production, using music from a now discarded pas de six. The first part is used for a woman who brazenly pulls Benno, Siegfried's friend and the prince into a dance.</p>
        <p>In the first lakeside act, music (from Act III of the 1877 score) is too pretty for the bombastic rhythms  that follow. It is nonetheless inserted for a new solo for Siegfried. Mr. Bocca caught the music's lilt, but the steps, essentially leaps and cabrioles, were merely a pretext for dancing.</p>
        <p>The new choreography tends toward the conventional, with the exception of Rothbart's solo in the ballroom. The trio that dances the traditional pas de trois in Act I has a brief adagio in the ballroom to start the entertainment. The fiancees waltz goes to four women and their escorts because each introduced a troupe of character dances. These are spiffy and smartly danced: only the Spanish dance, in yellow costumes, looks a bit fussy.</p>
        <p>The music for the Russian dance, often omitted, goes to the courtly Rothbart. Mr. Malakhov was the best and pounced on a throne. Cold and mesmerizing, he used his pure line to seductive effect: the four brides were drawn to his spellbinding persona and others onstage retreated in fear, a wonderful touch. The Russian folk motifs in the music were recalled in the dancers' occasional folk gestures (folded arms). The violin melody gave the choreography a cantilena flow, which Mr. Belotserkovsky's more sinister elegance used powerfully on Saturday night; at the matinee, Mr. Gomes banked on sheer menace in the amplitude of his dancing.</p>
        <p>As for the principals, Ms. Jaffe was at her best as a sorrowful Odette tender in an unfolding love story. Ms. Tuttle was strangely stiff and unyielding in this ''white act'' and was more at ease as Odile. Their partners danced on an acceptable level but did not have their usual stamina.</p>
        <p>The exceptional performance, is however, not that rare at Ballet Theater. The last ''Don Quixote'' of the season on Thursday night had Irina Dvorovenko and Mr. Belotserkovsky in a stunning display of integrated artistry and technique, a truly flawless and exciting performance.</p>
        <p>To use technique with artistic depth is what Ms. Ananiashvili displayed even more grandly. Her Odette was all urgency and despair in the clearest of classical dancing. The whiplash speed of her fouettes and the forcefulness of her Odile, danced with brilliant attack, was not a circus act. In this memorable performance, dance spoke expressively through its own terms.</p>
