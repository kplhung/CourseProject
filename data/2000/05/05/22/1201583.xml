        <p>Among personalities in the coaching profession, there are the fire-breathers and the cool breezes. Bobby Knight, the Indiana basketball coach, is often among the first group. Larry Robinson, the Devils' coach, is usually among the latter. Robinson is unlikely to put his hands on an athlete's throat or to insult people gratuitously or to scream at his team in the dressing room. He prefers to offer positive reinforcement.</p>
        <p>But Robinson, with exasperation and in desperation, yelled quite a bit Saturday night after the Devils fell to the brink of elimination in the Stanley Cup playoffs. After a 3-1 Flyers victory in Continental Arena, Robinson kicked over a trash can and addressed his players in shouts that could be heard in the hallway.</p>
        <p>''I don't regret anything I said,'' Robinson said yesterday afternoon, in measured tones, before the team boarded its bus to Philadelphia. ''However, my voice regrets it and my head regrets it. I felt it was the right place and the right time. They had to know exactly how I felt. At least I know I've done what I could.''</p>
        <p>It was quite a performance for a man whose first grandchild was born over the weekend, and it might not be enough. The Devils trail by 3-1 in the four-of-seven-game Eastern Conference finals, which resume tonight at First Union Center. A Flyer victory would put Philadelphia into the Stanley Cup finals against either Dallas or Colorado, who are tied at two victories apiece in the West. After winning Game 1, the Devils have lost three consecutive games to a similar team that may be a little bigger, tougher and more skilled.</p>
        <p>Robinson said yesterday that he thought his team had become undisciplined when the score was 1-1 in the third period. He said his players needed to maintain their positions and trust in the game plan. He said his forwards needed to push to the net and try for more rebounds. He said that some players were giving full effort but that not everyone was trying hard enough. So he wanted more energy, execution, focus and finish. The message seemed to have reached its intended receivers.</p>
        <p>''Hopefully, he's going to get it through our thick skulls what he wants,'' Scott Stevens, the captain, said. ''You never see him mad. I was shocked. It was very upsetting.''</p>
        <p>Martin Brodeur, the goalie whose play improved Saturday despite another costly turnover that led to the first goal, said it was not wrong for Robinson ''to lose it like that.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''If he doesn't, it would have proved he doesn't really care.''</p>
        <p>Scott Gomez, the rookie center, said Robinson's loud words ''showed us how much he cares about us and how much he believes in us.''</p>
        <p>Stevens was one of two veteran defensemen praised by Robinson for their effort. The other was Ken Daneyko. When prompted to cite a few more positives yesterday, Robinson instead chose to stress negatives. ''Philadelphia has scored probably 90 percent of their goals going to the net and getting rebounds,'' he said. ''We have yet to score off a rebound. That's what the New Jersey Devils have been noted for, going to the net and being hard to move in front of the net. We haven't been in front of the net. You don't have to move anything that's not there.''</p>
        <p>Two of those big forwards are Bobby Holik and Randy McKay. Holik scored the only Devil goal Saturday and McKay assisted. Referring to Robinson's outburst, McKay said: ''It better have the desired effect because he was right. We didn't play smart.''</p>
        <p>Of his teammates, McKay said: ''It wasn't from lack of trying. Everyone in here cares. I'm not questioning anybody's character.''</p>
        <p>Holik added that Robinson's words had an effect. ''If a man of that stature says something, everybody in the room had better listen,'' Holik said.</p>
        <p>But sometimes what is unspoken is also important. The Flyers can be an intimidating team around their net. Dan McGillis, a big defenseman, is having a good series. Rick Tocchet and Keith Jones, rugged forwards, are punishing people who turn their backs to them in pursuit of the puck. And forwards like Mark Recchi, John LeClair and Keith Primeau are breaking free for rushes going the other way, putting defensemen like Stevens and Daneyko on their heels.</p>
        <p>While Philadelphia will probably advance, a Devil comeback is not totally far-fetched. In a tournament this long, teams can fall into slumps and come out of them. The Devils showed signs of it Saturday. The stylish attacking tandem of Gomez and Alexander Mogilny, despite being on the ice for Philadelphia's winning goal, had several close chances. Mogilny rang a crossbar behind goalie Brian Boucher. Gomez charged to the net and ended up in it after Boucher stopped his low backhander. Claude Lemieux was aggressive and nasty and inspired fans and teammates with his penalty killing.</p>
        <p>But with Robinson's words ringing in their ears, do the Devils have enough time, grit and skill to recover?</p>
        <p>''We'll see,'' Brodeur said. ''It's up to us.''</p>
