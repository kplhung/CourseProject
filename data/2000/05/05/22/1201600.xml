        <p>A charter plane carrying 19 people from a gambling trip in Atlantic City to Wilkes-Barre, Pa., apparently developed engine trouble yesterday morning as it approached its destination and crashed, killing everyone aboard, federal and local officials said.</p>
        <p>The airplane, a twin-engine turboprop with 17 passengers and 2 crew members, had made one failed approach at Wilkes-Barre/Scranton International Airport and was trying another approach when it crashed at 11:48 a.m., said George W. Black, a federal National Transportation Safety Board member. The plane fell in Bear Creek Township, a hilly, wooded area in northeast Pennsylvania about nine miles southwest of the airport.</p>
        <p>Fire, police and ambulance crews found the burning wreckage, but no survivors, in the Pocono Mountains nearly an hour later, at 12:45 p.m, said Ron Rome, spokesman for Luzerne County 911.</p>
        <p>The pilots of the Jetstream 31, which is owned by Executive Airlines of Farmingdale, N.Y., had reported engine trouble as the plane made its first approach through cloudy skies and mist, prompting airport officials to dispatch fire and ambulance crews.</p>
        <p>''There is some indication on the air traffic control tapes that they were encountering engine problems during the first approach and those continued into the second attempt,'' Mr. Black told reporters in Washington.</p>
        <p>On a portion of the tape played on ABC News, one pilot can be heard saying ''tell him we lost both engines.'' The other pilot says, ''We lost both engines.''</p>
        <p>Wy Gowell, assistant director of the Wilkes-Barre airport, said low cloud cover and rain required the pilots to try an instrument landing. The pilots were in contact with air traffic controllers for the first landing attempt, Mr. Gowell said, but communications and radar contact were lost as they tried once more.</p>
        <p>Megan Maguire, 37, who lives two miles from the crash scene, said she was gardening when she heard an aircraft motor revving overhead. ''I realized that it wasn't a lesson, that it was a plane in distress,'' she said. ''I looked up, but I couldn't see it because of the clouds. Then the motor quit.''</p>
        <p>The passengers, all or most of them from the Wilkes-Barre area, left on Saturday for Atlantic City.</p>
        <p>Mr. Black said investigators would analyze the cockpit voice recorder to determine what problems the pilots believed they were encountering. He said the Jetstream 31, like many planes its size, was not required to carry a flight data recorder, which tracks speed, altitude and other crucial details.</p>
        <p>The plane, manufactured by British Aerospace, does not have a history of malfunctions, Mr. Black said. According to a Federal Aviation Administration data base, the plane that crashed was built in 1998.</p>
        <p>Accidents, though, have happened. On Dec. 13, 1994, a Jetstream 31 operated by American Eagle crashed on approach to Raleigh-Durham International Airport in North Carolina, killing 15 of the 20 people aboard. The cause was pilot error.</p>
