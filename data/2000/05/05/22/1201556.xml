        <p>Michael Ovitz, superagent and former Disney president, has made his name -- and a considerable fortune -- aggressively securing hundreds of millions of dollars in royalties and other payments for artists and studios he represents. But his latest endeavor, a pop culture hub on the World Wide Web, has the potential to drain income from some of those same clients by enabling users of the site to copy music, media and other files from one another.</p>
        <p>Last year, Mr. Ovitz and a business partner bought 51 percent of Scour.com, an entertainment site and search engine used to find music and movie files. Last month, though, the site added a feature, Scour Exchange, that lets users exchange one another's multimedia files online, including copyrighted material by some of the world's leading artists, some of them clients of Mr. Ovitz's talent management agency, Artists Management Group.</p>
        <p>The involvement of Mr. Ovitz in Scour.com would seem to be at cross purposes with his role in Artists Management. But his backing of Scour.com also marks a significant shift in the roiling battle over copyright protection in the digital age.</p>
        <p>Until now, the arch-nemeses of the recording industry have been 20-something entrepreneurs creating Web sites that make it easy to exchange copyrighted files over the Internet. Mr. Ovitz's backing for Scour.com's file exchange mechanism suggests opposition may be eroding to technology that, by many accounts, will force the development of new business models for the entertainment industry, changing how artists are compensated for their work and how their work is protected.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ovitz declined to comment. But James Ellis, general counsel for Artists Management Group and a director of Scour Inc., said it makes more sense to embrace the technology than to fight it. ''In the face of a rapidly changing marketplace, Scour had to respond to maintain and grow its audience and give them what they wanted,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ellis said that Scour hoped to find ways to make file sharing lucrative for artists. And he said Scour was vigilant about kicking copyright infringers off the site if Scour was informed of the problem.</p>
        <p>Dan Rodrigues, 24, co-founder and president of Scour.com, said Scour Exchange could not be held accountable if some people used the service to pirate copyrighted material. ''It's impossible for us to screen, censor or review,'' he said. ''It's not our job to know what is, or is not, infringing.''</p>
        <p>The Scour.com Web site does include a copyright notice, but practically speaking it is simple to obtain copyrighted material by entering the search term for the desired song or movie.</p>
        <p>Some Internet music industry analysts say Mr. Ovitz has a potentially serious conflict of interest in holding a stake in Scour.com and managing artists whose music and movies may be traded freely on Scour Exchange. The works of several of the artists represented by Mr. Ovitz's agency are exchanged on Scour Exchange, including music from the group Blues Traveler and the singer Liz Phair.</p>
        <p>''There is a significant potential for conflict,'' said Kevin Hause, an Internet music analyst with IDG, a market research group. ''He is someone entrusted to look out for the best interest of artists.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Rodrigues said that Mr. Ovitz is actually building a bridge between the old world media companies and the new business models of the Internet. ''He understands both sides of the equation,'' he said. ''He understands what entertainment companies need and what's important to copyright holders and what works on the Web.'' Scour.com was founded in a two-bedroom apartment near the campus of the University of California at Los Angeles. Traffic to the site grew quickly, and the company eventually attracted the interest of Mr. Ovitz, who read about Scour.com in the school newspaper, and the grocery billionaire Ron Burkle. For $4 million, the pair took a majority stake in the business, said Mr. Rodrigues.</p>
        <p>The company reached deals with a number of Internet start-ups and media companies to provide content to include with the search function. Scour is now contemplating a variety of business models, including taking advertisements, selling subscriptions and selling multimedia content. It now features movie trailers and music promotions provided legitimately by movie and record companies, along with some items for sale, like music available for download. The site now receives 2 million visitors each month.</p>
        <p>As with Napster, the controversial site offering a service that lets users share and trade their music files online, users of Scour download software over the Internet that allows them to store and catalog multimedia files on their own computers. Scour Exchange posts those catalogs, then enables users of the service to visit one another's computers over the Internet and share and download one another's music, movies, and other holdings. The service does not provide the content, but facilitates the exchange.</p>
        <p>Napster, based in San Mateo, Calif., has been sued by the Recording Industry Association of America for reportedly facilitating music piracy in a pending case that many expect to set a precedent. The association, and the five major record labels it represents, say its artists are losing tens of millions of dollars a year because of rampant music piracy on the Internet, a practice the trade group says threatens to undermine the very economics of the creation of music.</p>
        <p>Hilary Rosen, the president of the recording industry association, said the group was aware of Scour Exchange's activities and was considering its options. But she said the organization did not want to rush to file lawsuits against each Napster-like service, hoping the decision in that case case might dissuade copycats. ''We don't have any interest in litigating our way through the Internet,'' she said.</p>
        <p>But in reality, the industry association might simply lack the resources to file enough lawsuits given the boom in these services and the complexity of the attendant technology. Most recently, a 23-year-old Irish programmer created Freenet, which would enable people to share files online directly with one another in a way that would make it virtually impossible for copyright holders to find a central database or hub to blame for the interaction.</p>
        <p>Therein lies a key argument of Mr. Rodrigues and Scour Exchange. They contend that the free exchange of files online may be inevitable, so media companies might as well get on board. ''We're trying to work with entertainment companies to help them use it,'' Mr. Rodrigues said, adding, ''Ovitz has been instrumental to us in leveraging entertainment  relationships he has.''</p>
        <p>Scour has some agreements with other companies aimed at helping  users to download multimedia files in a way that protects copyright. For instance, Liquid Audio, a company that makes technology to enable digital distribution of music in a way that protects copyright and that is a partner of some of the major record labels has a deal with Scour to enable it to sell several encrypted songs on the site. Andrea Cook Fleming, vice president of marketing for Liquid Audio, said Liquid Audio is providing an alternative to people who might otherwise pirate music, rather than pay for it.</p>
        <p>Another company that has signed a deal with Scour is Nettwerk Productions, an independent record label aiming to promote one of its up-and-coming artists, a musician named Brian Transeau who records as BT, on Scour. Cathy Barrett, director of strategic marketing for Nettwerk, said the deal puts the label in an awkward position because the site is promoting the music of BT, but with a single click of the mouse, users can get pirated versions of BT's songs for free through Scour.</p>
        <p>But BT said people will inevitablytrade copyrighted music on the Web, so artists might as well try to figure out how to capitalize on the sites making that possible. ''It's an uncontrollable situation,'' BT said. ''You might as well embrace it and make the best of it or you're going to go insane trying to prevent it.''</p>
        <p>Still, some musicians and their agents disagree. Howard King, a Los Angeles attorney who is representing Metallica and Dr. Dre in lawsuits against Napster, said that Mr. Ovitz and Scour have an obligation to stand up to piracy. ''Just because some kid in the Philippines knows how to create a devastating virus, doesn't mean we say, 'oh it'll happen again,' and not do something about it,'' he said.</p>
