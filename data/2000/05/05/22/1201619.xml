        <p>Joseph J. DioGuardi, the former United States representative from Westchester County who entered the race for Senate three weeks ago seeking the support of the Conservative Party, said last night that he would quit the race today and endorse Representative Rick A. Lazio.</p>
        <p>Mr. DioGuardi, in an interview, said that with Mr. Lazio now in the race against Hillary Rodham Clinton, he was no longer worried that conservative viewpoints would not be represented in the campaign.</p>
        <p>Mr. DioGuardi had been critical of Rudolph W. Giuliani, asserting that Mr. Giuliani did not represent the views of Conservative or even most Republican voters in New York.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani quit the race on Friday.</p>
        <p>Mr. DioGuardi's presence in the race had been the subject of some worry for Republicans because historically, the statewide races they have won have almost always been ones in which they  had Conservative Party support.</p>
        <p>The state Conservative Party chairman, Michael Long, had strongly praised Mr. DioGuardi's candidacy, though he has told associates that he will support Mr. Lazio once Mr. DioGuardi formally leaves the race.</p>
        <p>''I entered the race because I believed that New Yorkers needed a clear, common-sense, conservative alternative to Hillary Clinton,'' Mr. DioGuardi said. ''I didn't see anyone willing to put out a clear conservative agenda. I can say now with a clear conscience that my ideas will continue in this race, even if I do not.''</p>
