        <p>It had become a race about celebrity and personality: Hillary Rodham Clinton attacking Mayor Rudolph W.

        <p>It had become a race about celebrity and personality: Hillary Rodham Clinton attacking Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani as harsh and temperamentally unsuited for a place in the United States Senate, and Mr. Giuliani portraying Mrs. Clinton as opportunistic and untrustworthy, unsuited to represent New Yorkers in Washington.</p>
        <p>But as Mrs. Clinton and her new opponent, Representative Rick A. Lazio of Suffolk County, set out across New York yesterday, laying out their divergent ideologies and themes, it was clear that the new candidate lineup had prompted the first lady, and to a lesser extent the Republicans, to retool their campaigns.</p>
        <p>This has become a contest that is slightly less about who the participants are, and slightly more about what they stand for. And it is a development that appears to be welcomed by both sides.</p>
        <p>In the old lineup, Mrs. Clinton had sought to attack Mr. Giuliani on both his disposition and his ideology. But she kept returning to his jagged personality, in no small part because depicting the moderate mayor as too conservative was ''a stretch,'' as one of her advisers conceded yesterday with a sudden candor that surfaced with Mr. Giuliani's exit from the race.</p>
        <p>The situation has now flipped. Attacking the temperament of Mr. Lazio -- with his Boy Scout grin and telegenic good looks -- seems even more improbable than attacking Mr. Giuliani as hard-right conservative. But Mr. Lazio stands to the right of Mr. Giuliani, which means that Mrs. Clinton may now be able to draw on her ideological differences with Mr. Lazio that had proved so elusive with Mr. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>''We no longer have the hard-edged personality to pivot off,'' one of Mrs. Clinton's senior advisers said yesterday. ''Now we really are, in a large measure, in a campaign of issues. I think that issues and ideology are going to play more importantly going forward than personality.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, if Mr. Giuliani at times sought to resist Mrs. Clinton's attempt to draw ideological distinctions between them, Mr. Lazio seemed yesterday to be encouraging them, in the calculation that he would benefit from the contrast more than Mrs. Clinton would.</p>
        <p>At every turn, he belittled his new opponent as a liberal, reprising the playbook that Republicans have used in every state election in New York and throughout the country for the last 10 years.</p>
        <p>He even endorsed some Republican Congressional positions that Mr. Giuliani had shied away from over the last few months.</p>
        <p>To a certain extent, one of Mr. Lazio's advisers said, the new candidate, who won the formal endorsement of the state Republican chairman, William D. Powers, yesterday, will carry on with some of the more personality-driven attacks that Mr. Giuliani offered.</p>
        <p>In an interview on Saturday, for example, he described Mrs. Clinton as an opportunist, and he has repeatedly labeled her a carpetbagger, in a line of attack that his aides said would be central to his campaign.</p>
        <p>While a series of polls have suggested that the issue of Mrs. Clinton's new residency has receded in the minds of many New Yorkers, it is the kind of topic, one of Mr. Lazio's advisers said, that could help the Republicans paint Mrs. Clinton as ''not one of us,'' to use the shorthand favored by consultants.</p>
        <p>One Republican suggested that that could prove easier for the easygoing Mr. Lazio than for the hard-driven Mr. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Giuliani was the opponent, there was some disagreement among Mrs. Clinton's advisers about the extent to which they should go after the mayor's personality rather than his ideology, because the two held such similar views. The question now, one aide said, is determining how aggressively Mrs. Clinton should move to show Mr. Lazio as ideologically extreme.</p>
        <p>In particular, Mrs. Clinton's advisers were described as divided last night over whether they should quickly wheel out television advertisements attacking Mr. Lazio's positions in Congress, in particular his support for much of Newt Gingrich's Contract With America.</p>
        <p>To date, it has been Mrs. Clinton's surrogates (yesterday, it was her press secretary, Howard Wolfson, on ''Meet the Press'' on NBC) rather than the candidate who has carried out the attack, reflecting the concern among Mrs. Clinton's advisers that she remains too polarizing a figure to carry out the assaults herself.</p>
        <p>In truth, it was Mrs. Clinton's aides who first attacked Mr. Lazio, a point that Mr. Lazio made over the last two days.</p>
        <p>Still, Mrs. Clinton presented herself as something of the victim in an appearance in Albany.</p>
        <p>''I was a little disappointed yesterday,'' she said, ''that my latest opponent has already started hurling insults instead of offering ideas about what we can do to improve the lives of New Yorkers. I am sorry that my opponent couldn't even get through his announcement speech without going on the attack.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani was often cautious about embracing Republican positions on matters pending in Congress, because he viewed himself as a moderate on many issues and also because he suspected that reporters' inquiries had been encouraged by the first lady. Mr. Lazio showed no such reticence yesterday in a marathon series of television interviews.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio, for example, said he would accept the support of the Independence Party, even if Patrick J. Buchanan was its presidential candidate. Mr. Giuliani, aware of the dangers of letting himself be associated with Mr. Buchanan, had avoided making a commitment on that issue, despite Mrs. Clinton's best efforts to push him to do so.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio also attacked Mrs. Clinton's attempt to promote a national health care plan, describing it on ''Meet the Press'' as ''an abysmal disaster.'' Mrs. Clinton has repeatedly called for universal affordable health care. He also defended his support of much of Mr. Gingrich's Contract With America, in particular the balanced-budget amendment and welfare reform.</p>
        <p>''I'm for those things,'' Mr. Lazio said. ''I'm proudly for those things.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said he opposed handgun registration, which he described as ''invasive,'' in contrast to Mrs. Clinton, and supported a ''significant tax cut,'' though he stopped short of endorsing the one supported by his party's presumptive presidential nominee, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas. He also said he was open to allowing some private investments of Social Security funds.</p>
        <p>To some extent, in taking these positions, Mr. Lazio is simply expressing what is already on the record from his eight years in Congress. It is, Mr. Lazio suggested yesterday, an expression of his ideology and reflects his view of government and the world.</p>
        <p>The first lady's advisers had a different view, particularly after six months of trying to force Mr. Giuliani to take positions on many of these same issues. In that regard, Mrs. Clinton's aides, following Mr. Lazio's travels through the morning talk shows, were more than a little heartened by what they saw.</p>
