        <p>On Wednesday night, President Clinton will headline the most lucrative political fund-raising event ever, collecting at least $25 million from 12,000 donors packed into the MCI Center here.</p>
        <p>The record-setting gala, a salute to Mr. Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, will draw thousands of small donors who bought $50 tickets, but also a large number of mega-givers, including 15 to 20 people who have raised or pledged at least $500,000 each. Some of these big givers will share a private dinner with the president and vice president the night before the gala at the BET Jazz club in downtown Washington.</p>
        <p>The occasion cements the president's legacy as the most prodigious political fund-raiser ever. Democratic fund-raisers and the White House estimate that Mr. Clinton is responsible for raising at least $500 million and perhaps as much as $1 billion since 1992 for his own campaigns and for Democratic candidates. He is also helping Vice President Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton collect millions of dollars for their campaigns and is also soliciting money for his presidential library.</p>
        <p>The $500,000 donors to the gala represent a new level of giving in the arena of soft money, the large, unrestricted contributions to the political parties. Among those who have given or pledged to raise this amount are S. Daniel Abraham, the chairman of Slim-Fast Foods Company; Claire Dwoskin, the wife of a Northern Virginia property developer, and Vinod Gupta, an Internet entrepreneur from Omaha.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has devoted an extraordinary amount of time to cajoling cash from Democratic donors, speaking at 350 fund-raising events just since January 1997, an average of one every three days. That total includes only the events that appear on the president's official calendar; it does not even capture countless private sessions that have brought additional millions of dollars into Democratic accounts.</p>
        <p>Lately, Mr. Clinton has also embarked on a campaign to raise $200 million for his presidential library in Little Rock, Ark., a project that just last year was projected to cost $125 million. Multimillion-dollar pledges to the library have been made by wealthy Clinton friends like David Geffen, the movie mogul and co-founder of DreamWorks SKG.</p>
        <p>Unlike contributors to federal candidates and parties, donors to the library do not have to be disclosed and so far the White House has refused requests from the news media to make public the names of library contributors. The president has been criticized for raising these large, undisclosed contributions for his library while he is in office, although previous presidents have also engaged in similar fund-raising.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's success in raising money astonishes even those who have closely watched him do it over the years. ''I don't know how you count it,'' said Mark Weiner, a financier from Rhode Island, a friend of Mr. Clinton's and treasurer of the Democratic Governors' Association. ''I would think Clinton has raised $1 billion.''</p>
        <p>Joe Lockhart, the White House press secretary, said that Mr. Clinton had certainly raised hundreds of millions of dollars and that the figure was probably approaching $1 billion.</p>
        <p>''It's not even close to debatable that he has raised more money than any other figure in American political history,'' a senior Democratic party official said.</p>
        <p>Of course, some of Mr. Clinton's more brazen tactics, especially inviting big donors to sleep at the White House and to fly on Air Force One, have drawn criticism as well as scrutiny from federal investigators.</p>
        <p>Aside from his sheer effort at cultivating wealthy donors from Hollywood to Wall Street, what is the secret of Mr. Clinton's success? His admirers and his critics both said that he combined the celebrity and charisma of a polished entertainer with the power and gravitas of the presidency, a formula that left potential donors energized.</p>
        <p>Many of the givers also strongly agree with the president's agenda and want to see Vice President Gore and other Democratic candidates continue his policies.</p>
        <p>Although he has been tireless in his fund-raising duties, Mr. Clinton seldom directly asks his audiences for cash, leaving that task to others, most notably Terry McAuliffe, who is one of the president's closest friends. Mr. McAuliffe estimated that he had raised at least $300 million for Mr. Clinton and Democratic causes, including the 1997 inaugural, the White House millennium celebration, the president's legal defense fund and the campaigns of Mr. Gore and Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''In all the years that I've known Bill Clinton, I've never known him to ask someone for a contribution,'' Mr. McAuliffe said. ''He doesn't like it. He'd rather have someone else do it, like me.''</p>
        <p>From his first campaign for the White House in 1991-92 until this year, Mr. Clinton has voiced support for changing the current campaign finance law, including a ban on soft money. In October 1997, for example, Mr. Clinton appeared with Congressional advocates of campaign finance revisions to demand action on legislation to tighten the laws.</p>
        <p>''The tide of reform is coming in,'' he said at an appearance in the White House. ''I will fight as hard as I can for as long as I can'' for passage of reform legislation.</p>
        <p>Asked why he did not forswear the raising of soft money, which led to the scandals and investigations of his 1996 re-election campaign, Mr. Clinton said: ''I'm not sorry that I did what was available under the existing system. But I have always been for changing the system. I'm just not for unilateral disarmament.''</p>
        <p>Vice President Gore has asked Gov. George W. Bush of Texas to join him in eschewing soft money, but the offer was rebuffed and the soft money race has continued unabated. The two political parties have raised $160.5 million in soft money for the 2000 election, a record for this point in an election cycle.</p>
        <p>Critics say Mr. Clinton could have devoted his charisma and the power of the presidency to achieving significant changes in the political money game. Instead, they say, he used his skill to stretch it to the breaking point while feeding public disillusionment with politics.</p>
        <p>''Bill Clinton's presidency on campaign finance has been one of the great squandered promises and missed opportunities of all time,'' said Scott Harshbarger, the president of Common Cause and a former Democratic attorney general of Massachusetts. ''He has eliminated any sense of shame or outrage from the system of money-raising in politics.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's fund-raising prowess has generated envy and spawned imitators in the Republican Party, Mr. Harshbarger said. ''The smoothness, the ingenuity, the almost sheer gall -- people saw what was happening and now everyone has just copied him,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It is impossible to calculate with precision how much money Mr. Clinton has raised since he announced his candidacy for president in 1991. He collected about $30 million in relatively small donations for his own primary campaigns in 1992 and 1996. But he also helped the Democrats raise $123 million in soft money for the 1996 campaign and is committed to helping the party surpass that number this year.</p>
        <p>He has also raised untold millions of dollars for Democratic candidates for the House and Senate, for mayors and governors and candidates for state legislatures. He raised $10 million for the millennium celebration. The president's friends and supporters also donated $8 million to two of his legal defense funds.</p>
        <p>He was the host of more than 100 White House coffees in 1995 and 1996, each of which had a fund-raising goal of about $400,000. And he has tirelessly traversed the country in aid of virtually any Democrat willing to share a stage with him.</p>
        <p>''He went into Indiana and did an Evan Bayh dinner in 1996 and we raised $1 million,'' said Mr. Weiner, the treasurer of the governors' association. ''He'd show up at the Democratic Governors' Association and we'd raise $5 million.''</p>
        <p>And while Mr. Clinton says he does not relish the job of raising money, he offers no apologies for the aggressive way that he and Mr. McAuliffe have taken to the task.</p>
        <p>''Terry and I have never been of the school that believed that we ought to act embarrassed because we ask people in the system we have to contribute so that we could get our message across,'' Mr. Clinton said at a tribute to Mr. McAuliffe last June.</p>
        <p>Mr. McAuliffe sees Wednesday's gala as the crowning achievement of his and the president's fund-raising career and a fitting send-off for Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>''Who doesn't love it?'' Mr. McAuliffe said. ''This is a perfect ending.''</p>
