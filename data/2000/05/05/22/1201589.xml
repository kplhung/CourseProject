        <p>A student movement demanding sweeping political change is surging in popularity and is now a significant target for attack by the government of the Yugoslav president, Slobodan Milosevic.</p>
        <p>The movement, called Otpor, or Resistance, has given fresh energy, insouciance and an arrogant innocence to Mr. Milosevic's political opposition. Otpor has not been shy about criticizing opposition leaders for their lack of unity and credibility.</p>
        <p>Loosely organized and without a clear leadership structure that could be subject to arrest, Otpor is intended to be difficult to repress. But it shows few signs of becoming a serious revolutionary organization.</p>
        <p>Still, government officials are attacking the group as ''fascist hooligans'' and ''terrorists.'' The officials are giving strong signals that Otpor will be a prime target of -- or at least the pretext for -- a sweeping new law on terrorism that could be introduced as early as Monday.</p>
        <p>The law, said to be largely based on the emergency measures in force here during NATO's bombing war last year, could provide for detention without charges or limitations, restricting the rights of the accused.</p>
        <p>At the moment, people can be detained for questioning for 72 hours without being charged, a measure the police have been using liberally against young Otpor activists all over Serbia.</p>
        <p>During the war, the police could detain people on national security grounds for up to 60 days without trial, and the police were given the right to search people or property without warrants. The law under consideration would also authorize the police to confiscate all firearms, registered or not.</p>
        <p>If passed in such a form, the law would create an informal state of emergency. It could be used against opposition politicians and also against independent journalists, whom the government accuses of working for NATO and the ''enemies of the state.''</p>
        <p>Otpor spokesmen say more than 200 of their members have been detained in the last week throughout Serbia. They are often arrested at home in the early hours, questioned by the police for up to a day or more, threatened and sometimes beaten.</p>
        <p>On Saturday another 34 Otpor people and eight opposition politicians were detained, questioned and later released.</p>
        <p>''The regime senses the danger, that we don't care a lot about anything else other than taking them down,'' said Milan Samardzic, 23, a law student with Otpor. ''We're not in it for power or money, unlike many of the opposition politicians. We just want change. The idea of resistance itself is very powerful.''</p>
        <p>Vukasin Petrovic, 23, a political science student and one of Otpor's steadily changing spokesmen, says that about 25,000 people have signed up to become members, and that the organization may be able to call on as many as 50,000 people.</p>
        <p>More ask to join every day, Mr. Petrovic says, ''and we're getting a little overwhelmed. Things are moving at a very quick pace.''</p>
        <p>Otpor started as a student response to a restrictive law on universities in October 1998. While many regard it as a movement of arrogant rich youths from nice families, its surge in popularity is a direct result of disappointment with this generation of political leaders, who have failed during the last decade to bring down Mr. Milosevic.</p>
        <p>Otpor activists say they want to inspire the population and ''guide'' the political opposition, as a kind of monitor, to keep them unified.</p>
        <p>''The opposition leaders have shown that they are very vain, and that their petty interests are more important to them than our larger interests as a country,'' Mr. Samardzic said. ''We say we've seen through the regime and we're disappointed in the opposition. The opposition leaders don't seem to have a solution, and people don't trust them. But we do deserve the people's trust, at least so far.''</p>
        <p>During the last large opposition rally in Belgrade, on April 14, an Otpor member was on stage with leaders of political parties and said, ''Our task is to secure your victory.'' He then warned them in vulgar terms: ''Gentlemen, this time there will be no betrayal, because whoever betrays now is scum.''</p>
        <p>At a later rally, on May 15, many leaders including the Democratic Party head, Zoran Djindjic, wore Otpor T-shirts, bearing a fist, though in Mr. Djindjic's case he wore a stylish black sport jacket over it. It was also a gesture of solidarity with two young Otpor activists and a lawyer who had been beaten badly in Mr. Milosevic's hometown, Pozarevac, by bodyguards working for his son, Marko.</p>
        <p>The case was important because two local judges and a prosecutor resigned, apparently over pressure from the government to bring charges of attempted murder against the young men, who asserted that they had not begun the fight. One judge who released them quit after they were rearrested.</p>
        <p>The government has tried its best to impugn the organization. When Bosko Perosevic, a senior official of Mr. Milosevic's party, was slain in Novi Sad on May 13, the government announced that the 50-year-old killer was an Otpor activist and a supporter of the opposition figure Vuk Draskovic's party, suggesting that both were in the pay of Western intelligence agencies.</p>
        <p>Both charges were denied, but the police said they had found Otpor leaflets in the killer's apartment.</p>
        <p>''We're kind of like a marketing agency,'' Mr. Petrovic said, ''promoting one idea, the idea of resistance as a habit of mind, a way of standing up in dignity. To me, dignity is very similar to resistance.''</p>
        <p>Otpor tries to provoke and mock the authorities with sometimes daily happenings and with slogans like ''Bite the system.'' In the last three months, Mr. Samardzic said, Otpor has put up 400,000 posters and handed out two million leaflets and badges throughout Serbia.</p>
        <p>Otpor insists that this is paid for solely with donated materials, labor and money from Serbs abroad. But the organization is also getting money and advice from the West through programs to ''promote democratization'' in Serbia.</p>
        <p>After the seizure of the main opposition television station Studio B last week, Mr. Samardzic said he was appalled by the confused reactions of the opposition, especially Mr. Draskovic, the leader of the Serbian Renewal Movement, who remained in Serbia's sister republic, Montenegro, for two days before returning to Belgrade.</p>
        <p>''The silence of the opposition has not just been strange, it's been a disaster,'' Mr. Samardzic said. ''People assume Vuk is afraid. Well, so are we all. But he's not selling popcorn'' -- he is a political leader.</p>
        <p>Otpor is proposing a program of civil disobedience, of the kind Gandhi used against the British in India. When he is reminded that the Serbian authorities are not British and behave by different rules, Mr. Samardzic only shrugs.</p>
        <p>Milan Milosevic, an analyst for the independent weekly Vreme, who is no relation to the president, said: ''Otpor is important because they are a litmus test for popular feeling against the authorities. It is true that they are a judgment on the opposition, but no one sees them as a political alternative. They show no leadership or management. People make the Otpor fist to show the political leaders that they're not serious enough.''</p>
        <p>One opposition leader, Zarko Korac, a psychologist and university professor who heads the Social Democratic Union, says teachers are accustomed to being criticized by students.</p>
        <p>Otpor matters, he says. ''They have the energy and the innocence of youth, and they are uncompromising and unyielding,'' he said, noting that the government of President Suharto in Indonesia had been toppled by student demonstrations.</p>
        <p>''These students feel they have no future, no employment,'' Mr. Korac said. ''They can't travel and work. So they are fighting for their own future, which is also the future of the country.''</p>
        <p>Otpor's symbol, the fist, ''is a clear, clean message,'' he said.</p>
        <p>So clean that one of Serbia's most influential writers and briefly Yugoslavia's president, Dobrica Cosic, walked into an Otpor office this month and filled out a membership form. Mr. Cosic, a nationalist picked by Mr. Milosevic and then discarded by him, is blamed by some for helping to create the myth of Serbian sacrifices in Kosovo. A drawing by a noted cartoonist, Corax, showed Mr. Cosic scrubbing himself clean in a bathtub using the skeletal fist of Otpor.</p>
        <p>Still, with signs pointing toward an attempted crackdown and even a ban on Otpor, the organization will need whatever help it can get.</p>
        <p>Mr. Korac says such a crackdown on Serbia's children, like the seizure of Studio B, has cumulative consequences with the public. ''It's like insults in a marriage,'' he said. ''It adds up. It may not show right away on the streets, but it's building. People are very angry.''</p>
