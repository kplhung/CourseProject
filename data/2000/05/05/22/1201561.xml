        <p>DEAR DIARY:</p>
        <p>Basketball playoff season reminds me of the reaction of my young nephew Chris Nieroth to an invitation to his first Knicks playoff game. Chris was an avid Knicks fan who was thrilled with the gift of a No. 33 jersey like that of his favorite player, Patrick Ewing. When we offered Chris and his dad the use of our season seats for an early playoff game, his excitement was boundless. His only question was whether we thought he should wear his new jersey. He seemed eager but a little troubled by the idea. When questioned about his reluctance, my nephew, a 5-year-old, 4-foot-tall towhead, replied: ''But what if they think I'm Patrick Ewing?''</p>

        <p>Honesty is the Best Policy Department:</p>
        <p>Sherri Steinfeld Maxman was at dinner at the Trattoria dell'Arte in Midtown when she heard the restaurant's staff serenading a celebrating diner:</p>
        <p>''Happy birthday to you,</p>
        <p>Happy birthday to you</p>
        <p>Happy birthday, total stranger,</p>
        <p>Happy birthday to you.''</p>
        <p>Jerry Waisman was walking along First Avenue at noon on a balmy day and turned the corner onto 30th Street. He and everyone else in the vicinity noticed a muscular young man coming toward them from Second Avenue. The young man tried, without success, to get a cab. After a short time he gave up, walked to a brownstone and disappeared through a doorway. There was one unusual thing about the sighting, which also stopped other passers-by in their tracks: the young man, who had been walking unconcernedly, was wearing nothing but white socks and a smile.</p>
        <p>Maybe he couldn't get a cab because the drivers could see that he didn't have a wallet, Dr. Waisman suggested.</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>A friend of mine from out of town was visiting recently and walked into a Starbucks in our West Side building late one evening. He asked for a large cup of coffee.</p>
        <p>Clerk: Venti?</p>
        <p>Friend: A large coffee.</p>
        <p>Clerk: Do you want a venti?</p>
        <p>Friend: I just want the largest cup of coffee you have.</p>
        <p>Clerk: Well, that's a venti.</p>
        <p>Friend: I don't care what you call it! I just want a large coffee.</p>
        <p>Clerk: Well, sir, you don't have to get rude.</p>
        <p>Friend: Right, and I don't have to buy coffee here.</p>
        <p>He turned and walked out of the store.</p>
        <p>The next evening he returned, assuming the same clerk would not be working. As he approached the counter, the clerk, the same one, looked up and recognized him. ''Your usual, sir?'' he said.</p>

        <p>SUMMER 2000</p>
        <p>Better than traveling country to country</p>
        <p>This I say for sure</p>
        <p>Far better it is to sit at home</p>
        <p>Reading the brochure.</p>

        <p>A friend on a Madison Avenue bus recently became fed up, as were most of the other passengers, by a young woman having an interminable, and loud, conversation on her cell phone. Just before a stop, another woman got up and said to the woman on the phone: ''Here, it might be more convenient for you to attach the phone to your ear.'' She then delved into a bag, handed the stunned woman some glue, and made a triumphant exit off the bus. The remaining passengers didn't applaud, but there were some heartfelt ''Good for you'' comments as she alighted, and smiles, giggles and laughter -- with one exception.</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>My wife, Sheila, and I went to the Angelika Film Center to see Stanley Tucci's movie ''Joe Gould's Secret.'' I sat in the car while she checked the starting time and learned that the movie was not playing there. We went around the corner to find a newspaper with theater listings and as I parked, whom did I see standing there but Stanley Tucci. ''Your movie isn't playing here,'' I said, and he replied that no, it wasn't, but he told us where it was playing -- in the East Village, uptown and on the West Side. Only in New York can you get directed to a movie by the director himself.</p>

        <p>FOR THE BIRDS</p>
        <p>Some birds were pecking on the green</p>
        <p>While I was jogging round</p>
        <p>It was a common springtime scene,</p>
        <p>Yet one that would astound</p>
        <p>If any bird pulled up a worm</p>
        <p>From 'neath that bright green field,</p>
        <p>'Cause it was made of Astroturf</p>
        <p>With not one worm to yield.</p>
        <p>Which made me wonder, did those birds</p>
        <p>Know they were deceived?</p>
        <p>Or just like us, had they been fooled</p>
        <p>By what their eyes believed.</p>
        <p>A simple case, it seems to me:</p>
        <p>What looks most appetizing,</p>
        <p>On closer look is oft revealed</p>
        <p>To be false advertising!</p>

        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>One of my favorite New York stories took place in Ohio. I was in a secondhand bookstore in Columbus and noticed a man and a woman talking with the proprietor. He was telling them about a mall where the store had additional books for sale. The mall was about an hour's drive on the freeway and the owner was describing how to get there. ''We're from New York; we don't know anything,'' the woman said. Although I hadn't been included in the conversation, I couldn't resist the opening. ''You know, it's really unusual to hear somebody say 'We're from New York and we don't know anything,' '' I said.</p>
        <p>The woman turned to me and offered an explanation. ''We're from upstate, not the city,'' she said. '' It makes a big difference.''</p>

        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>My son Brian, a born and bred New Yorker, now lives in New Orleans. A little homesick at Passover, he tried to find a restaurant that served some Passover-type food. A luncheonette not far from the French Quarter had this sign in its window: ''Real Home Cooking Like Mom Makes.'' He went in and asked the waitress if they had gefilte fish.</p>
        <p>''No,'' she said. ''But we have delicious catfish.''</p>
        <p>''Do you serve matzo with it?''</p>
        <p>''What's that?'' the waitress asked.</p>
        <p>''You know, matzos,'' Brian said. ''They're eaten for Passover.''</p>
        <p>''Oh, no,'' the waitress replied. ''We don't serve leftovers.''</p>
