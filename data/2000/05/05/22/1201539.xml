        <p>It is not unusual for reporters to complain that candidates do not hold enough debates. In New Jersey, however, where the Democratic contenders for the United States Senate have been debating about debates for months, editors from Gannett papers around the state found an unusual way to initiate at least one additional face-to-face encounter.</p>

        <p>It is not unusual for reporters to complain that candidates do not hold enough debates. In New Jersey, however, where the Democratic contenders for the United States Senate have been debating about debates for months, editors from Gannett papers around the state found an unusual way to initiate at least one additional face-to-face encounter.</p>
        <p>Gannett, which owns seven papers in New Jersey, invited Jon S. Corzine to meet with members of its editorial boards at 1 p.m. last Thursday.</p>
        <p>Unbeknownst to Mr. Corzine, who has been reluctant to debate his opponent, Jim Florio, the papers also invited Mr. Florio.</p>
        <p>Like Mr. Corzine, Mr. Florio said he was stunned when he arrived and found his rival in the room. Both men were even more surprised when the editors told them that instead of the individual interviews they had expected, the candidates were expected to engage in a debate.</p>
        <p>When the impromptu encounter ended, both campaigns complained that they had been misled.</p>
        <p>Robert E. Ingle, Gannett's Trenton bureau chief, said the papers had decided months ago to save time by holding just two editorial board meetings, one for the four Republicans and one for Mr. Corzine and Mr. Florio. Mr. Ingle, who was in charge of setting up the encounters, said that both campaigns were fully informed of the arrangements, although he could not recall whom he spoke with at either campaign. If Mr. Corzine was misled, it was by his own people, Mr. Ingle said.</p>
        <p>And was Mr. Florio misled, in precisely the same way, by his aides? ''Well, who else would it be?'' Mr. Ingle asked.</p>
        <p>With less than three weeks remaining until the primary, neither campaign wanted to antagonize a newspaper chain by complaining publicly, so their spokesmen tried to laugh off the matter.</p>
        <p>But Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School of Communications at the University of Pennsylvania, said that a newspaper can harm its own credibility if it is not candid and complete in its dealings with political candidates.</p>
        <p>''The protocol is that it's the newspaper's responsibility to be absolutely clear about who will be appearing at a forum and what the format will be,'' she said. ''Otherwise, it sounds like the candidates were blindsided.''</p>
