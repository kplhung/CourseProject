The ensuing withdrawal by Phil Knight, Nike's chief executive, of a $30 million contribution was an I'll-take-my-ball-and-go-home reaction to an important issue.</p>

        <p>If companies like Nike are interested in working to alleviate poor working conditions in certain countries, then they should engage in serious discussions with the Worker Rights Consortium.</p>
        <p>But if Nike doesn't, perhaps Mr. Knight could still demonstrate his dedication to improving workers' rights by taking the $30 million and using it to raise some workers' wages and benefits.</p>
