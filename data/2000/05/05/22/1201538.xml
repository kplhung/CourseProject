        <p>Last week, Diane Sawyer received some very good news.</p>
        <p>ABC executives announced she would be a co-host for a news magazine program, ''Prime Time Thursday,'' starting in the fall. It will be preceded by ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire,'' the ratings blockbuster.</p>
        <p>It is widely believed that by moving Ms. Sawyer's prime-time duties from Wednesday to Thursday nights  after ''Millionaire,'' executives have given her good leverage in the highly competitive race to win interviews with sought-after newsmakers. If the game show can maintain its popularity, Ms. Sawyer can guarantee potential subjects extra-large audiences.</p>
        <p>But what is good for Ms. Sawyer does not necessarily make for smooth office politics.</p>
        <p>Barbara Walters, who won fame for her interviews with newsmakers long before Ms. Sawyer came along, had been pushing for an installment of ''Millionaire'' before her Friday night edition of ''20/20.''</p>
        <p>Instead, programmers scheduled a new sitcom in the time slot. Called ''Madigan Men,'' it stars Gabriel Byrne as a divorced architect living in New York. Ms. Walters is said to be relieved that she will no longer have to follow the network's Friday night programming block tailored for youngsters, which is being dismantled for the fall. But she has expressed deep disappointment about not following ''Millionaire,'' said executives close to the situation.</p>
        <p>They added that they expected Ms. Walters to raise that disappointment again when she renegotiates her contract in the fall.</p>
        <p>Ms. Sawyer, it should be noted, played the good soldier last year in agreeing to be a co-host of ''Good Morning America,'' a grueling assignment.</p>
        <p>Victor Neufeld, who is executive producer for all of the ABC news magazine programs, said, ''All this has to do with is how the network saw the schedule working out for the best.''</p>
