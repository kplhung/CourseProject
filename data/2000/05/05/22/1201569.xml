        <p>Today, the Devils viewed their situation going into Game 5 on Monday night against the Flyers as pure desperation.

        <p>Today, the Devils viewed their situation going into Game 5 on Monday night against the Flyers as pure desperation. The Devils are faced with a virtually insurmountable task of winning three in a row after having lost three consecutive games to the Flyers in the four-of-seven-game Eastern Conference finals.</p>
        <p>A number of Devils players, with the captain Scott Stevens leading the way, said that it was not impossible to win the series -- even though he was aware that since the National Hockey League expanded in 1967, no team had rallied after the second round of the Stanley Cup playoffs to capture a series after trailing by 3-1.</p>
        <p>''My message to the team is that it can be done,'' Stevens said today, echoing Coach Larry Robinson. ''My message is that we've played some of our best hockey on the road. This is a one-game thing, and I hope we have the best game on the road tomorrow.''</p>
        <p>Robinson went ballistic in the dressing room after his team's 3-1 loss to the Flyers in Game 4 on Saturday night put the Devils on the brink of elimination. The yelling was out of character for the usually calm Robinson and it surprised most of his players. ''I never thought I'd see him that angry,'' Stevens said.</p>
        <p>Robinson is waiting to see if his team takes his words to heart.</p>
        <p>''Time will tell if the message got across,'' Robinson said today after conducting off-ice meetings with his team. ''It builds up and it's better to get it out than keep it inside. What we want to do in the next game is play like there is no tomorrow, and that is play desperate. We haven't been getting great efforts from everybody. There is a lot more each guy can give.''</p>
        <p>Ken Daneyko, who in this series has joined Stevens as the only two consistently reliable defensemen, said this afternoon that his team was still very much in the series.</p>
        <p>''We were in control after the first game and a half, and they have now won three in a row,'' Daneyko said. ''We're capable of doing the same thing. We lost control and it snowballed. We just have to play more determined than we have.</p>
        <p>''It's one game, and it's something that can be done. Get a win and get a good feeling in the locker room. They've gotten bounces and breaks, but they've worked hard. The same can happen to us with hard work.''</p>
        <p>Robinson said that not all the Devils have worked their hardest in this series. That was not an issue during the first two rounds against Florida and Toronto. Today, Robinson reiterated his unhappiness that a number of his players have not done more.</p>
        <p>But what bothered him the most, he said, referring to his yelling after the game Saturday night, was that his team had gotten away from the game plan.</p>
        <p>''A lot of the guys think, 'I'm going to win this by myself,' but it doesn't work that way,'' Robinson said. ''Individuals win awards. Teams win championships. We can be the first team to make history. No other team has come back from 3-1. It's a challenge we should accept. They won three games and there is no reason why we cannot do the same.''</p>
        <p>Winning three games in a row was possible for the Devils three weeks ago, when the team and Martin Brodeur were at the top of their game. But Brodeur's performance has deteriorated and so has the performance of his teammates.</p>
        <p>When Robinson spoke about effort from his players, Stevens and Daneyko were the only ones he mentioned. Robinson said today that he was also puzzled by the lack of sacrifice on the part of professional athletes these days.</p>
        <p>''It's past my comprehension why athletes today cannot sacrifice giving everything in key situations,'' Robinson said. ''I can't fathom anything else but to have everybody give their best.''</p>
        <p>Robinson was particularly disappointed that his players have repeatedly failed to go to the net and get rebounds, the way the Flyers have done.</p>
        <p>''Philadelphia has scored 90 percent of their goals going to the net and getting rebounds,'' Robinson said. ''We haven't been hard to move away from the net because we're not there. We've got to be more committed going to the net.''</p>
