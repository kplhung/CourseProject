        <p>Letter from Tom Godfrey says contrary to Jaime Sneider's contention in his May 16 Op-Ed, student protests do not harm factory workers; says university apparel producers cannot evade labor laws by shifting production locations</p>

        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>''Good Propaganda, Bad Economics,'' by Jaime Sneider (Op-Ed, May 16), misses the point behind anti-sweatshop protests at my campus and elsewhere in this country. While it may be true that Nike's factories in Vietnam provide ample wages relative to other opportunities, the university community is not satisfied with relative fairness.</p>
        <p>As major consumers of college-logoed products, the protesters are saying they are willing to support higher prices for these goods, provided they are produced according to fair labor principles.</p>

        <p>''Good Propaganda, Bad Economics,'' by Jaime Sneider (Op-Ed, May 16), misses the point behind anti-sweatshop protests at my campus and elsewhere in this country. While it may be true that Nike's factories in Vietnam provide ample wages relative to other opportunities, the university community is not satisfied with relative fairness.</p>
        <p>As major consumers of college-logoed products, the protesters are saying they are willing to support higher prices for these goods, provided they are produced according to fair labor principles.</p>
        <p>These protests do not harm factory workers. While transnational corporations often move factories when individual countries impose labor standards, university apparel producers cannot evade these rules by shifting production locations because the university will revoke licensing rights to those who do not follow the labor guidelines.</p>
