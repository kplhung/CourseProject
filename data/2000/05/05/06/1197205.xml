        <p>The filly Winning Colors burst from the starting gate first, hustled to a four-length lead with half a mile to go, was ahead by three lengths around the final turn and hung on in the stretch to win the 1988 Kentucky Derby by a neck. Strike the Gold broke leisurely, was in 10th place with half a mile to go, swung hard into sixth place on the final turn and passed five horses in the final quarter of a mile to capture the 1991 Derby.</p>
        <p>Early foot and stone-cold closing are the two extreme tactics that have been employed to win this one-and-a-quarter-mile race -- or so-called classic distance -- with 3-year-old horses who have never run that far full throttle in their still young and developing lives. Running styles mostly dictate the approach. Sometimes it is the pace of the race. Or the size of the field.</p>
        <p>''And a lot of the time, it's the riders taking what is given them,'' said Gary Stevens, the recently retired jockey who won his first of three Derbies aboard Winning Colors. ''We're trying to keep our horses from getting bumped around. We're figuring the clock in our head.</p>
        <p>''You make split-second decisions out there. If you choose wrong, you're in big trouble.''</p>
        <p>The 126th running of the Kentucky Derby on Saturday, however, is likely to be won by a colt who is never too far from the front but well ahead of the closers. In other words: a stalker.</p>
        <p>The reason? In this crowded field of 19, there are many early runners -- High Yield, Hal's Hope, Trippi and perhaps Graeme Hall -- who are likely to pressure a hot pace. And there are plenty of closers -- Aptitude, Wheelaway, Deputy Warlock and Impeachment -- who will have to contend with one another and heavy traffic to find the openings to unleash late runs.</p>
        <p>Besides, statistics show that a stalking trip is the way to win the Derby. In the past 50 runnings, 35 of the winners have been in first, second or third position at the one-mile point of the race, immediately before the quarter-mile stretch run. ''You have to be in position to win at that point,'' the four-time Derby-winning trainer D. Wayne Lukas said. ''You gotta ride, you gotta ride hard to the quarter pole.''</p>
        <p>Last year Lukas watched his colt Charismatic slingshot from seventh place to third at the mile mark by sweeping three wide on the turn. It put him in position to barrel down the stretch to victory. Menifee, the runner-up, had been 14th at the mile mark. Despite a furious kick in the stretch, he came up a neck short.</p>
        <p>But several other things have to go right long before a colt gets to the quarter pole at Churchill Downs. The most immediate is the break from the gate.</p>
        <p>''You can't stumble, get squeezed or bumped and let 15 or 18 horses get in front of you,'' said Chris McCarron, a two-time Derby winner who will be on The Deputy on Saturday. ''It leaves an awful amount of work to do and it's tough to get your horse to relax.''</p>
        <p>In 1987, aboard Alysheba, that was  exactly what happened to McCarron. Breaking from the No. 3 post, horse and rider got stuck between horses just after the start and were 14th in a 17-horse field after the first quarter of a mile. McCarron managed to relax Alysheba down the backstretch and hustle him to third position by the mile mark.</p>
        <p>But the colt was also extremely talented, as he demonstrated in the stretch: Alysheba clipped the heels of the runner-up, Bet Twice, and stumbled, forcing McCarron to almost hold him up, but still won. With Go for Gin in 1991, McCarron's ride was less eventful. The colt ducked in at the start, but gained the lead coming out of the first turn and led the rest of the way.</p>
        <p>Bob Baffert, a two-time winning trainer in the Derby, says the race is won or lost on the first turn after a long run of five-eighths of a mile from the gate -- especially in unwieldy full fields. Both his winners -- Silver Charm in 1997 and Real Quiet in 1998 -- loped into the turn relaxed and forwardly placed.</p>
        <p>Last year each of his three horses struggled early. Prime Timber was fanned four wide; the filly Excellent Meeting was second to last; and General Challenge broke slow, was bumped and had to be checked -- or pulled up -- by Stevens, the rider, when squeezed between two horses. ''I'm always terrified watching them head into the first turn,'' Baffert said. ''I can tell right then if we're going to be in the race. I knew last year we were out of it.'' His horses finished fourth, fifth and 11th.</p>
        <p>Once past the turn and into the backstretch, trainers and jockeys agree that the best thing to happen is for nothing to happen. ''You want them quiet, in rhythm, maintaining their position,'' said Pat Day, who won in 1992 aboard Lil E. Tee and will ride High Yield on Saturday.</p>
        <p>Lukas likes to say that the race to win the Kentucky Derby begins at the track kitchen, the breakfast haunt for track personnel located on the backside roughly at the top of the final turn near the five-eighths pole. This is the launching pad for the jockey's move.</p>
        <p>Whether it is Fusaichi Pegasus, The Deputy, War Chant, More Than Ready or any other starter, some horse and rider will be picking off the leaders en route to the quarter pole and the top of the stretch. It is visually stirring here or on television.</p>
        <p>''You better have something in the tank,'' Lukas said.</p>
        <p>Staring down that long stretch to the finish, there is nothing more a jockey can do. ''You keep them busy and ride with everything you got,'' Day said. ''You just hope you got enough horse left to hang on. Sometimes you do. Sometimes you don't.''</p>
        <p>For the riders, as they straighten their horses for home, it is a visceral phenomenon. They run straight into the wall of sound as 150,000 people try to scream home their favorites.</p>
        <p>''There is nothing to compare it with,'' Day said. ''It takes your breath away.''</p>
