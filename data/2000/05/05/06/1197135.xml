        <p>Most players are familiar with the Lightner Double, which is a move at the slam level to direct a nonobvious lead, often in dummy's suit. But the mini-Lightner, an application of the same principle at the level of four or five, is less well known.</p>
        <p>A good example occurred in the semifinal stage of the New York Grand National Teams, played Sunday at the Town Club, 9 East 86th Street in Manhattan. North opened one club, which was artificial and usually strong. Barry Rigal, East, now ventured three clubs in the teeth of the vulnerability.</p>

        <p>Most players are familiar with the Lightner Double, which is a move at the slam level to direct a nonobvious lead, often in dummy's suit. But the mini-Lightner, an application of the same principle at the level of four or five, is less well known.</p>
        <p>A good example occurred in the semifinal stage of the New York Grand National Teams, played Sunday at the Town Club, 9 East 86th Street in Manhattan. North opened one club, which was artificial and usually strong. Barry Rigal, East, now ventured three clubs in the teeth of the vulnerability.</p>
        <p>A double would have collected at least 500 for North-South, but it is not easy to penalize such bids, and North-South continued to the normal contract of four hearts.</p>
        <p>The three-club bid had been made with the idea of suggesting a club lead, but now East changed his mind. He no longer wanted a club lead.</p>
        <p>He produced an unexpected double, a mini-Lightner warning West against leading a club. Such doubles are nearly always based on a void somewhere, usually in dummy's original suit.</p>
        <p>The West player, Jeff Aker, had no trouble in reading the message and deciding what to do. He carefully led the diamond two, a suit-preference request for a club return. Rigal ruffed and returned the club three, giving his partner the entry to provide a second diamond ruff.</p>
        <p>That was three tricks for the defense, and the club ace and an eventual trump trick resulted in a two-trick penalty.</p>
        <p>In the replay, Rigal's wife, Sue Picus, held the South cards. After her partner, Alex Ornstein, opened one diamond, East did not choose to bid, inhibited by the vulnerability.</p>
        <p>The final contract was four hearts, and West made a ''safe'' lead of the heart queen. This proved safe for South, who made two overtricks by maneuvering to draw two rounds of trump and then discarding her club losers.</p>
        <p>The Rigal team, which included Brady Richter and John Solodar, gained 13 imps en route to victory over a team led by Jesus Arias.</p>
        <p>In the final this month, the Rigal team will meet Michael Polowan, Adam Wildavsky, Richard Schwartz, Robb Gordon, Zia Mahmood and David Berkowitz, who won their semifinal match against a team headed by Glenn Milgrim.</p>
