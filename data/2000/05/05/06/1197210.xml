        <p>From the day that St. John's received the commitment from Darius Miles, a 6-foot-9-inch McDonald's all-American forward, there was still the possibility that he would never play for the Red Storm.</p>
        <p>Miles, regarded by some as the top high school player in the nation, declared yesterday that he would enter the National Basketball Association draft. Miles averaged 22.1 points, 12.1 rebounds, 7.4 blocks and 3.4 assists for East St. Louis Senior High School (Ill.), and had been projected as a likely lottery pick in the draft.</p>

        <p>From the day that St. John's received the commitment from Darius Miles, a 6-foot-9-inch McDonald's all-American forward, there was still the possibility that he would never play for the Red Storm.</p>
        <p>Miles, regarded by some as the top high school player in the nation, declared yesterday that he would enter the National Basketball Association draft. Miles averaged 22.1 points, 12.1 rebounds, 7.4 blocks and 3.4 assists for East St. Louis Senior High School (Ill.), and had been projected as a likely lottery pick in the draft.</p>
        <p>He became the second high school player this week to declare for the N.B.A. draft, joining DeShawn Stevenson of Washington Union High School in Fresno, Calif., who had committed to the University of Kansas.</p>
        <p>''I'm not surprised at all,'' St. John's Coach Mike Jarvis said. ''I probably would have been surprised if he didn't go; that's how good I thought he was. But it was definitely worth the time and effort. St. John's should be grateful because it really helped in recruiting Omar Cook. Nothing has changed here. I think we've got an outstanding recruiting class from which we can play on and build on.''</p>
        <p>Without Miles, who had signed a letter of intent with St. John's last fall, the Red Storm had a good recruiting class. Jarvis landed one of the three highly regarded point guards from New York, Omar Cook of Christ the King in Queens, who played alongside Miles in postseason all-star games. St. John's also has commitments from center Mohamed Diakite and forward Willie Shaw of Kennedy High School in the Bronx, and Kyle Cuffe of Rice High School in Harlem.</p>
        <p>As St. John's has taken its place again among the elite teams in college basketball, it has found itself coming to terms with the idea that the talent that it has garnered is equally coveted at the next level. Last year the Red Storm lost Ron Artest to the N.B.A. following his sophomore season, and point guard Erick Barkley will follow this year.</p>
        <p>But Jarvis and St. John's felt it was worth the risk to try to bring in a player of Miles's stature.</p>
        <p>''We talked all the way through from the time we signed him,'' said Jarvis, who has had his own flirtations with the N.B.A., speaking to Michael Jordan about the vacant coaching job with the Washington Wizards. Jarvis, who was a finalist for the job last year before it went to Gar Heard, told the Wizards last year that he felt it was wrong to leave St. John's after one season.</p>
