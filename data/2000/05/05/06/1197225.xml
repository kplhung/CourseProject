        <p>Editorial says that, despite political contretemps, interim chancellor Harold Levy is still strongest candidate for permanent post in New York City</p>

        <p>New York City's Democrats have long criticized Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the Republicans for manipulating the Board of Education to meet political ends.

        <p>As of a few days ago the Board of Education had settled on a half-dozen finalists for the chancellor's job and seemed likely to choose Mr. Levy, who was appointed interim chancellor against Mayor Giuliani's wishes but has shown excellent management and personnel skills during his six months on the job.

        <p>New York City's Democrats have long criticized Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and the Republicans for manipulating the Board of Education to meet political ends. But the dispute that erupted among Democrats this week over the naming of the next schools chancellor shows that Democrats, too, are capable of using the schools as a venue for political infighting. Despite the contretemps, the interim chancellor, Harold Levy, is still the strongest candidate for the job.</p>
        <p>As of a few days ago the Board of Education had settled on a half-dozen finalists for the chancellor's job and seemed likely to choose Mr. Levy, who was appointed interim chancellor against Mayor Giuliani's wishes but has shown excellent management and personnel skills during his six months on the job. Then the process was thrown into an upheaval when Irving S. Hamer Jr., the Manhattan member of the Board of Education, suddenly withdrew his support of Mr. Levy and placed his own name in contention. He would surely not have done this without the knowledge and support of Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, who appointed him to the board.</p>
        <p>Ms. Fields denies any political calculation, but she has flirted with the idea of running for city controller, a position being sought by one of Mr. Levy's most powerful supporters, the school board president, William Thompson. By deploying Dr. Hamer, Ms. Fields was threatening to shift the balance of the board and reminding Mr. Thompson and his supporters that she can help or hurt them, as she chooses. As it turned out, the board blocked Dr. Hamer's candidacy, saying that the deadline for submitting his name had passed.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hamer has had his eye on the chancellorship for years. With a doctorate from Harvard, a firm record of community school work and a term as a deputy commissioner in the State Department of Education, he is clearly an able and committed educator. But Mr. Levy's management experience and record of achievement as interim chancellor have gained him a great deal of support. Since he took the position in January, he has set a different tone at the board, targeting longstanding problems that have vexed chancellors for decades.</p>
        <p>Mayor Giuliani seemed ambivalent about Mr. Levy yesterday. But Mr. Levy is off to a good start and should be given the job permanently instead of bringing in yet another new face. The school system needs stability after suffering from years of turmoil and uncertainty.</p>
