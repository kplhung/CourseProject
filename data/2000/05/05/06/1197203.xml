        <p>For Cardinal Bernard Law, the archbishop of Boston, Cardinal John O'Connor was a friend to whom he spoke nearly every day by telephone, a rare colleague with whom he could share the distinctive and unusual concerns that come with being one of the most public figures in the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
        <p>''We could share honestly what we were facing,'' said Cardinal Law, in an interview at a downtown hotel here this evening, three days before he was to give the homily at Cardinal O'Connor's funeral Mass.</p>
        <p>Cardinal Law said he had flown to New York to be with Cardinal O'Connor as the cardinal lay dying Wednesday, and spent the day at his bedside, praying with a small group of his friends and relatives.</p>
        <p>Cardinal Law came to Chicago today to participate in a long-planned gathering of American cardinals, an occasion made poignant by the death of a man so well known to each of the church leaders here.</p>
        <p>The occasion was the annual American Cardinals Dinner, an event held to benefit student scholarships to the Catholic University of America in Washington. In the brief interval since Cardinal O'Connor's death, the university's president, the Rev. David M. O'Connell, dedicated the event to the cardinal's memory.</p>
        <p>Eight cardinals have come to the event, six of them Americans, and  one of them Irish. The eighth is Cardinal Pio Laghi, a man deeply familiar with the United States and its hierarchy through his service as the Vatican's apostolic delegate to the American church in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>In individual interviews, several cardinals said Cardinal O'Connor had helped them with suggestions or ideas about their roles as public figures and managers of archdioceses.</p>
        <p>''Once I became archbishop of Chicago,'' said Cardinal Francis George, who was appointed to that position by Pope John Paul II in 1997, ''he gave me some very good advice, just sharing it, as an older brother would.'' Although he did not specify what precisely Cardinal O'Connor told him, Cardinal George said, ''I looked to him to give me some clues as to how you handle the public role.''</p>
        <p>Cardinal Roger Mahony of Los Angeles had been head of the diocese in Fresno, Calif., for several years before Cardinal O'Connor was appointed to his first diocesan position. Cardinal Mahony became Los Angeles's archbishop a year after Cardinal O'Connor became archbishop of New York. Outside of their work on issues at the National Conference of Catholic Bishops, the two found common ground in sharing their concerns as administrators of vast, urban jurisdictions. They would sometimes discuss how to raise money to keep their inner-city Catholic schools open and available to the children of poorer families.</p>
        <p>''One of the insights he gave me,'' Cardinal Mahony said, ''which I never thought of, was to utilize the corporate community'' in finding supporters for inner-city Catholic schools. Corporations tended to donate to colleges, but, said Cardinal Mahony, ''you can't get anybody into college unless they finish high school.''</p>
        <p>The two cardinals also talked about books. ''We would try to remain as current as we could'' with theological publications, Cardinal Mahony said.</p>
        <p>Some of the cardinals who came here said they had known Cardinal O'Connor for decades.</p>
        <p>''I met him 20 years ago,'' said Cardinal Anthony Bevilacqua, archbishop of Philadelphia, recalling a time before he and Cardinal O'Connor were appointed to their respective archdioceses. Back then, said Cardinal Bevilacqua, a Brooklyn native, Cardinal O'Connor used to take him to dinner at an Italian restaurant that both of them enjoyed in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The two of them were attending a bishops' meeting in 1983, Cardinal Bevilacqua said, when Cardinal O'Connor came over and announced,  with some surprise, it seemed, that Archbishop Laghi had just informed him that the Vatican had picked him to be the next bishop of Scranton, Pa.</p>
        <p>''I said, congratulations,'' Cardinal Bevilacqua said. (Scranton turned out to be but a brief stop for Cardinal O'Connor, as the pope appointed him archbishop of New York the next year.)</p>
        <p>As for Cardinal Law, he said he came to New York to visit Cardinal O'Connor just after Cardinal O'Connor had undergone his surgery late last summer for removal of a brain tumor.</p>
        <p>''I asked him how he felt,'' Cardinal Law said, ''how he was dealing with it, because it was obvious what the course of that was going to be.'' He said that Cardinal O'Connor replied that he felt a ''great peace.''</p>
        <p>''The last time I spoke with him was the Friday before he died,'' Cardinal Law said. ''We had a great youth event, and I asked him for his prayers.''</p>
        <p>Cardinal Law said he received a call from Cardinal O'Connor's staff on Wednesday morning, telling him that the cardinal's health was deteriorating. ''I cleared off my schedule and flew to New York and spent the day with him,'' Cardinal Law said. ''I led the prayers for the dying. We went through them twice. We finished with them just as he died.''</p>
