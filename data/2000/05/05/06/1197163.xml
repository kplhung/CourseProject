        <p>The balmy spring night belied the occasion of sad memorial, and as the cantata played out around the city on the radio, listeners paused at the very idea of a spirited tango composed by some forgotten Buchenwald prisoner, not to mention the bold humor enduring beyond long gone lyricists at Auschwitz.</p>
        <p>''Hey! There's no life like life at Auschwitz!'' go the sardonic words, composed in a hidden gathering place at the camp by a group of inmates who had managed to filch some of their keepers' alcohol and imbibe.</p>
        <p>''Something inside is happening again,'' the anonymous composers attest in the intoxication that preceded their fate. ''We're beginning to feel like someone again.''</p>
        <p>Priceless snatches of such words and music drifted out across the capital on Wednesday night as part of Holocaust memorial week, bearing witness to some of the very toughest and most unconquerable victims of Nazi Germany's extermination machinery. While the secret classical music compositions of some prisoners survived them and have long been treasured, there is also a rich trove of the camp music of the common people that the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum has meticulously collected for anyone with the heart to delve into it.</p>
        <p>Donald McCullough was such a one when, as a newcomer to Washington, he turned to the museum in seeking to create a fresh work for the Master Chorale of Washington, the 150-member professional group that he serves as music director. The result is the Holocaust Cantata, a choral pastiche of authentic music and song from inmates translated from the Polish. The chorale's chamber singers performed its premiere two years ago.</p>
        <p>''What I found ultimately was, I think, the music of spiritual resistance,'' he said. ''They couldn't resist physically or verbally. But music was a way for them to resist, and that's the over-arching theme.''</p>
        <p>As it sounded forth from the local classical music station, WETA, the cantata was a reminder of the extraordinary preservation labors that some inmates carried on. They protected a legacy of tunes, some rebelliously composed on the spot, others fondly clung to by the millions who perished.</p>
        <p>Bret Werb, the musicologist at the Holocaust museum, directed Mr. McCullough to an enormous archive left by Aleksander Kulisiewicz, a Polish journalist and songwriter who was imprisoned for anti-fascist activities and became the camp troubadour at Sachsenhausen in Germany. He was regularly beaten for his lyrical resistance. But he survived, and upon liberation he dictated to bedside nurses 700 songs and poems he had memorized.</p>
        <p>''I came to this earth to share with you pain, in the same manner in which others come to share pleasures,'' Kulisiewicz declared while spending the remaining 37 years of his life on a monumental study of the music culture of the Nazi camps.</p>
        <p>Mr. McCullough said: ''Rather naively I went into this thinking, 'O.K., I'm going to call this ''Light in the Darkness'' or some such.' But that seemed trite once I really got into it because while there are some readings in the cantata about music giving them hope, so many other songs are about nothing but despair.''</p>
        <p>Josef Kropinski, imprisoned for editing an underground newspaper, spent five years in the camps and jotted down more than 500 musical pieces, some of them on the backs of Nazi bureaucratic forms. He smuggled out much of what he heard and sang, some of it now among the saddest parts of the cantata. ''In Buchenwald the birch trees rustle sadly,'' goes one tune he carried, ''as my heart sways languishing in woe.''</p>
        <p>Most of the material Mr. McCullough researched tells of the sufferings of the non-Jewish Polish slave laborers, dissidents and intellectuals, among the categories targeted by Hitler for destruction or decimation that the Holocaust museum continues to research.</p>
        <p>When he began, Mr. McCullough, a musician, not a linguist, could only search out promising tunes in the museum's archives. He discovered more fully what he had when a member of the chorale, Laura Kafka, the daughter of a Polish slave laborer, translated some lyrics. The story of her mother, Irena, a camp survivor, is now included as a terse spoken prelude to ''The Train,'' a farewell song that survived the Brzezinka camp. (''The dark hour's on us, our fate is sealed, I must forget you.'')</p>
        <p>Eventually Mr. McCullough hired a young Pole, Marcin Zmudzki, to scan and translate archive selections. Those translations were then adapted as cantata lyrics by Denny Clark, a member of the chorale.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cullough said: ''To me the cantata's broad message is simply: This happened. It can happen. And the line between good and evil in every single one of us is so thin.''</p>
        <p>Mr. McCullough specializes in what he terms ''music of the commoner'' that ''translate the statistics'' of history into a sense of individual experience. His latest choral work is rooted in the spirituals that aided the flight of American slaves along the underground railroad.</p>
        <p>''I love music that speaks of daily life but lasts for generations and generations,'' he said. ''I wondered if there was music like that that speaks of daily life in the camps that can give some insight into what it was like through music.''</p>
        <p>Josef Kropinski eventually answered the question in leaving one of the most mournful songs to survive now in the Holocaust Cantata:</p>
        <p>Dreams of yore will not return,</p>
        <p>Nor the reveries that burned,</p>
        <p>Nor the nectar of sweet lips,</p>
        <p>Nor those longing eyes!</p>
        <p>Cello, play the sad song,</p>
        <p>Song of pining, pain and tears,</p>
        <p>Song remembering dreams of love</p>
        <p>And of days now gone.</p>
