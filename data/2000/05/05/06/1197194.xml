        <p>Executives of Time Warner and ABC told City Council members yesterday that they could not guarantee that ABC programming would not be disrupted again as they proceed with bitter contract negotiations in the coming months.</p>
        <p>Barry Rosenblum, president of Time Warner Cable of New York City, and Thomas P. Kane, president of WABC, ABC's New York station, had been called before the new Select Committee on Media Services and Consumer Rights by Council Speaker Peter F. Vallone under threat of subpoena.</p>
        <p>And while the media executives appeared contrite, acknowledging that the blackout of ABC on Monday and Tuesday had provoked widespread anger among their viewers and subscribers, both balked at repeated attempts by Mr. Vallone to obtain their assurances that it would not be repeated by either company in an effort to gain leverage in their contract negotiations.</p>
        <p>''It is obvious to me that eight million New Yorkers are not party to this dispute, and they have a right to watch their televisions,'' Mr. Vallone said. ''Is it asking so much to just shake hands and get this over with?''</p>
        <p>''It would be difficult to do that,'' responded Mr. Rosenblum, whose company the Federal Communications Commission's Cable Bureau found at fault in the blackout and said might face fines. He said legal questions hanging over its negotiations with ABC and its parent, the Disney Company, prevented him from offering any guarantees. But he added that he found another service interruption ''hard to fathom.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Kane, referring to the complex negotiations taking place, responded to Mr. Vallone's request of a public handshake by the two sides by saying, ''We'd need 100 people on each side of the table to do that.''</p>
        <p>Although the outcry after the blackout has encouraged both sides to resolve their differences quickly, he said, ''I can offer no guarantee.''</p>
        <p>At the core of the corporate standoff is an attempt by ABC and Disney to obtain commitments from Time Warner of more widespread and profitable distribution of Disney programming on Time Warner Cable. For its part, Time Warner is pressuring Disney to revise its contractual agreements, made under 1992 federal guidelines, to arrangements that would require the cable operator to provide uninterrupted ABC programming but would weaken Disney's hand in other negotiations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenblum testified yesterday that Time Warner had decided to cut off the ABC signal in the New York area and in six other broadcast markets only after Disney had repeatedly insisted on short term, interim operating agreements, forcing Time Warner, under federal law, to repeatedly warn its viewers that ABC service might be permanently dropped.</p>
        <p>For its part, ABC complained that Time Warner launched a surprise attack by cutting its signal during ''sweeps,'' a ratings period of special importance to advertisers and broadcasters. The network's charge was upheld by the F.C.C.</p>
        <p>When Time Warner restored ABC's signal on Tuesday, the two companies agreed to resume contract negotiations, which had halted,  until at least July 15 if the issue is not resolved sooner. The public protest provoked by the blackout centered on what many called the near monopolistic powers of the conglomerates, and could prove most damaging to Time Warner because its pending merger with America Online requires federal approval.</p>
        <p>To placate critics and compensate its subscribers, Time Warner said on Thursday that each of its affected customers would receive a rebate for two days of basic cable service and 30 days of an additional premium cable channel free. Mr. Rosenblum told the Council committee that the rebate would be worth about $1, based on Time Warner's basic service cost of $15 a month, and the 30 days of service with a free premium channel would be worth an average of $13.95.</p>
