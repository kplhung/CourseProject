        <p>Gov. George Pataki got a mostly favorable ruling this week from the New York State Ethics Commission on the controversial financing of his two trips to Hungary in 1995 and 1996. The commission found no violation of the state's ethics law in allowing the Hungarian-American Chamber of Commerce, a nonprofit trade group largely financed by companies lobbying the governor's office, to pay for his trips, which were combined trade missions and family vacations. The panel said its ''extensive inquiry'' supported the governor's claim that neither he nor anyone else in his administration knew that the chamber was soliciting funds for the trips from companies with significant business pending in Albany. These included Philip Morris, the world's largest cigarette maker, Pepsico and two pharmaceutical giants, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb.</p>
        <p>Still, the commission's finding does not exonerate the governor for his poor judgment in having his senior economic adviser, Charles Gargano, contact the Hungarian-American Chamber and request that it pay for the travel. The chamber had few resources of its own and thus had to go out and raise the money.</p>

        <p>Gov. George Pataki got a mostly favorable ruling this week from the New York State Ethics Commission on the controversial financing of his two trips to Hungary in 1995 and 1996. The commission found no violation of the state's ethics law in allowing the Hungarian-American Chamber of Commerce, a nonprofit trade group largely financed by companies lobbying the governor's office, to pay for his trips, which were combined trade missions and family vacations. The panel said its ''extensive inquiry'' supported the governor's claim that neither he nor anyone else in his administration knew that the chamber was soliciting funds for the trips from companies with significant business pending in Albany. These included Philip Morris, the world's largest cigarette maker, Pepsico and two pharmaceutical giants, Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb.</p>
        <p>Still, the commission's finding does not exonerate the governor for his poor judgment in having his senior economic adviser, Charles Gargano, contact the Hungarian-American Chamber and request that it pay for the travel. The chamber had few resources of its own and thus had to go out and raise the money.</p>
        <p>Even a five-member ethics panel with three gubernatorial appointees felt compelled to express ''ethical concerns'' about the indirect financing of the trips by four companies disqualified under state law from directly providing such benefits. Citing the potential for companies' gaining improper influence in such cases, the commission announced that in the future, state officials would be required to ask proposed sponsors if they would be soliciting money to pay for the trip, and if so, from whom.</p>
        <p>That is progress, but it would be even better if state law simply barred officials from accepting free travel from any individual or group. Meanwhile the commission's verdict still leaves Mr. Pataki with some unfinished business. Now that he can no longer claim ignorance about the unsavory role of the lobbying companies in underwriting his Hungarian excursions, the only honorable course is to return the chamber's money. That portion allocable to state business can be paid by the government. The rest should be paid from his own pocket.</p>
