        <p>The Israeli government, facing a coming troop withdrawal from southern Lebanon for which it needs international backing, today decided not to continue reprisal bombings in Lebanon even though another cross-border guerrilla offensive took place this morning.</p>
        <p>In an effort to interrupt the volley of retaliatory attacks and defuse the exploding violence, Prime Minister Ehud Barak and his security cabinet decided that they would not respond militarily to a second day of Katyusha rocket fire on northern Israel.</p>
        <p>''Israel has no interest in escalation,'' a senior Israeli official said.  ''It was the appropriate moment to take a giant step backward.''</p>
        <p>No one was seriously hurt today by the barrage from the Hezbollah, or Party of God, on northern towns. But the rocket attacks, following quickly an assault on Thursday that killed an Israeli soldier and wounded civilians, reinforced the residents' apprehensions that they were entering a volatile period. They fear that the period leading up to the withdrawal, which is less than two months away, will be violent, and that the aftermath will be violent, too.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak has maintained that it is Israel's 22-year occupation of southern Lebanon that sustains the struggle, and that once Israel withdraws, the rationale for guerrilla attacks will fade. With United Nations troops in southern Lebanon and international monitoring in place, there is unlikely to be an all-out battle on the border, he says, even though it would have been safer to pull out as part of peace agreements with Syria and Lebanon.</p>
        <p>Having acted on public sentiment that Israel should end its involvement in Lebanon, Mr. Barak now expresses occasional impatience with those who are getting cold feet that he is following through on the most galvanizing campaign promise he made last spring.</p>
        <p>''It's a shame that this sweeping public discussion and internal dialogue about withdrawing from Lebanon didn't take place before we went into Lebanon,'' he said in an interview published today in the newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak did validate the concerns of northernmost residents -- if somewhat offhandedly. ''There are no added dangers'' to the north after a troop withdrawal, he said, ''apart from direct gunfire at the houses that sit right on the border.</p>
        <p>''It is true that those dozens of homes in 17 communities facing the frontier will be exposed to a higher risk,'' he continued, ''but the entire idea of the withdrawal is to reduce the friction, because this greatly reduces the legitimization of operations against us.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, in the latest escalation of violence, Hezbollah said Israel had started it. Israel and the Israeli-backed South Lebanese Army caused civilian deaths and injuries on Wednesday and Thursday in bombing and shooting attacks.</p>
        <p>Today, Israeli Army officials characterized those attacks as accidents, compared with the guerrilla response, which they said was deliberate and murderous.</p>
        <p>''There is a difference between mistakes and intended fire into the center of a populated city,'' said Maj. Gen. Giora Eiland.</p>
        <p>After the Hezbollah attacks this morning, the Israeli security cabinet sequestered itself in a Tel Aviv meeting room for the second time in less than 12 hours.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, the ministers emerged shortly before midnight to order a limited bombardment. Israeli warplanes struck two Lebanese power stations, a suspected guerrilla ammunition depot and the Beirut-Damascus highway.</p>
        <p>Proclaiming their targets to be carefully chosen and their fire to be efficient, Israeli Army generals noted today that only one civilian was injured. They also said that they had not considered striking Syrian targets, and that they did not think that Syria encouraged or instructed guerrillas to attack but rather failed to prevent their fire.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Barak has said that he is not optimistic that talks with Syria will resume before the withdrawal, ''the door is always still open,'' he says. European and Arab diplomats say they still think it is possible that peace negotiations will resume.</p>
        <p>Plans, however, are being made for a unilateral withdrawal from southern Lebanon, under a 22-year-old United Nations resolution.</p>
        <p>To carry out the withdrawal, Israel will need the support of the United Nations on the ground as well as in maintaining peace once Israeli troops leave. Mr. Barak also does not want to alienate countries with continued bombings, or military operations outside the zone of conflict, because he hopes to build up diplomatic support in case the withdrawal goes awry.</p>
        <p>Today, the American government urged Israel and Hezbollah to restrain themselves and expressed disapproval of both sides' attacks on civilians and civilian targets. ''There is no place for such an attack,'' a State Department official said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barak and his government faced some pressure from the right-wing opposition to bomb again and more intensely. But the opposition is not strong.</p>
        <p>Ariel Sharon, who led Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and now heads the opposition Likud Party, said just one airstrike was insufficient to signal Israel's intention to withdraw and stand up for itself at the same time.</p>
        <p>''We cannot change the situation with one lone action,'' Mr. Sharon said. ''We must carry out a thorough, systematic, and continuous policy to hit both Syrian and Lebanese interests in Lebanon.''</p>
        <p>The Hezbollah rocket attacks today on Qiryat Shemona and the small, poor town of Slomi proved to be less accurate than those on Thursday, which may indicate that they  moved their launchers under pressure, military experts said. Still, they hit four homes, two supermarkets, a youth hostel and more than a dozen cars. And since they fired on the northern and eastern Galilee at the same time, the hiss of the rockets and the sight and smell of the black smoke made residents feel that they were in a war.</p>
        <p>Many fled south to relatives' homes. Others huddled in bomb shelters, where they had been visited by Mr. Barak on Thursday night. He cautioned them to prepare for a long stay underground.</p>
        <p>But by nighttime, with all quiet, military officials told them that they could return to their homes for the Sabbath.</p>
