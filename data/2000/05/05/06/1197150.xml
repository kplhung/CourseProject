        <p>BMW A.G. of Germany raised new doubts today about the likelihood of a deal with a British consortium to rescue BMW's ailing Rover Cars operations at one of the biggest auto plants in Britain.</p>
        <p>BMW has been talking this week with the Phoenix Consortium, which is supported by labor unions and the British government, after the collapse of earlier negotiations with Alchemy Partners, a British venture capital firm.</p>
        <p>The myth-laden names of BMW's successive negotiating partners -- Alchemy and Phoenix -- have come to reinforce a sense among analysts that Rover will need something close to a miracle to survive.</p>
        <p>In Munich today, a BMW spokesman said the Phoenix bid, led by the former Rover chief executive John Towers, was still under consideration but ''the financial backing is not yet in place.'' The consortium, which is also supported by Rover dealers, has given no indication of how it would finance its plans to maintain Rover as a mass-volume car producer at the Longbridge plant, near Birmingham.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Jon Moulton, the head of Alchemy Partners, said that there was a ''fair chance'' that BMW would return to a deal with Alchemy, which wants to scrap the Rover line and produce niche sports car models under a new MG Car Company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Moulton said BMW must have concluded ''that mass production of cars at Longbridge is economic suicide.'' But British government officials who met with representatives of Phoenix today said the consortium's talks with BMW were continuing. The government officials said Phoenix had not asked for state aid in buying Rover.</p>
        <p>Alchemy's plan for Rover foresaw niche production of fewer than 100,000 cars a year, which would bring far greater layoffs among the 9,000 Rover workers at Longbridge than would the Phoenix proposals.</p>
        <p>For its part, BMW has said that it is losing more than $3 million a day at the Longbridge plant and that it will close the plant if it does not find a buyer by the end of the month. The uncertainty has already extracted a political price: the governing Labor party lost heavily in the Longbridge area in local elections on Thursday.</p>
        <p>The gloom over the plant's prospects has spread to some labor unionists.</p>
        <p>''We shouldn't get our hopes up unnecessarily, but we shouldn't panic either,'' said Sir Ken Jackson, the head of Britain's largest manufacturing union. He accused BMW of sending mixed signals, saying, ''If we followed every nuance from Munich, we'd believe about 10 different stories.''</p>
        <p>BMW attributes its losses at Rover in part to the strength of the British pound, which makes Rover cars expensive to export. At the same time, cheap imported vehicles from Continental Europe undercut Britain's domestic market, which the British government says is an average 10 to 12 percent more expensive than Continental European equivalents.</p>
        <p>Oddly, though, the Rover unit says its troubles, by spurring a burst of patriotic buying by British customers, have helped to produce the very effect that eluded BMW's six-year, multibillion-dollar investment in the British company.</p>
        <p>According to figures released today, Rover's car sales in April bucked the market trend and almost doubled, compared with sales in April 1999. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said Rover sold 22,665 vehicles in April, just behind 24,307 for Ford Motor and ahead of 21,908 for Vauxhall, which is owned by General Motors. Over all, new-car sales fell 8.1 percent in April. But Rover sales, also helped by discounts of up to $3,200 on the top-of-the-range Rover 75, surged despite worries about vehicle resale values if Rover collapsed.</p>
