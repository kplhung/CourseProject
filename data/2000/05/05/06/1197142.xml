        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>An April 26 editorial may have left a misleading impression about the House Ethics Committee's recent amendment to its rules. In September 1997 the committee, as required by a resolution of the full House, changed its reporting rule. The rule, still in effect, allows the committee to decide whether or not to transmit to the House the report of a subcommittee where no charges are made.</p>
        <p>The committee's recent amendment to its rules merely deleted the inoperative language of the old rule, which required the committee to transmit such a subcommittee report to the full House. That action did not, as your editorial says, rescind the old rule. The old rule was rescinded in 1997, and the new rule has been in effect since that time.</p>
