        <p>Government Investigating Ex-Director of C.I.A.  The Justice Department, in a reversal of an earlier decision, has begun a criminal investigation with the F.B.I. to determine whether John M. Deutch mishandled classified material by placing it on unsecure computers in his home, officials said.</p>

        <p>Spy Inquiry Finds Nothing  Federal officials conducted a highly classified espionage investigation into whether Israeli intelligence agents had used a software company in Missouri, Amdocs, to intercept telephone conversations from the White House, State Department and other agencies, officials said.

        <p>Differing on Gun Lawsuits  Vice President Al Gore vowed to veto any measure prohibiting cities from suing gun manufacturers, while Gov. George W. Bush suggested he might support such a measure. Mr. Bush also cast the vice president as a candidate whose advocacy of more stringent restrictions on firearms was simply the latest fashion, not a matter of steadfast principle.</p>

        <p>Gore's Proposals on Teachers  Vice President Al Gore promised to spend billions to recruit new teachers and increase teachers' salaries, but only if the states and teachers' unions agreed that all new teachers meet rigorous national standards and only if hiring decisions are based on expertise, not seniority alone.</p>

        <p>Chancellor Hopeful Barred  Irving S. Hamer Jr., the Manhattan member of the New York City Board of Education, was barred by his colleagues from pursuing the chancellorship.
