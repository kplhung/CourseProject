        <p>Forty minutes into practice today, Devils goaltender Martin Brodeur slumped forward in front of his net, his helmet touching the ice. Brodeur had blocked a shot by Petr Sykora with the puck hitting a portion of his ribs unprotected by his pads.</p>
        <p>On the eve of Saturday night's Game 5 of the Eastern Conference semifinal series here against the Toronto Maple Leafs, the one thing the Devils cannot afford is an injury to their All-Star goaltender.</p>
        <p>After a quick visit from the Devils' training staff, Brodeur bounced back to his feet. He was tentative at first, and appeared to be favoring his right side. By the end of the practice session, Brodeur had apparently shaken off the pain. He was not available for comment after practice.</p>
        <p>''He's fine,'' Devils Coach Larry Robinson said later, admitting that he had not seen Sykora's shot. ''He just got hit in the wrong place.''</p>
        <p>In no other sport, perhaps, does one player mean as much to his team as the goaltender does in hockey. This four-of-seven-game series has been the perfect example. The Maple Leafs' coach and general manager, Pat Quinn, said today that the reason his team was tied in the series, despite being outplayed by the Devils over much of the first four games, was because of the play of their All-Star goaltender, Curtis Joseph.</p>
        <p>''I agree,'' Robinson said.</p>
        <p>In terms of statistics, the Devils have outshot the Maple Leafs by double-digit margins in all four games. The Devils have controlled possession in the offensive zone and have dictated the style of the games.</p>
        <p>The Devils have done just about everything right. But the series is still tied.</p>
        <p>''If you look at the stats, there's no way you would think it'd be tied, 2-2,'' said Ken Daneyko, the Devils' longtime defenseman.</p>
        <p>''But,'' Daneyko said with a laugh, ''that's why they say stats are for losers.''</p>
        <p>As for Joseph's play?</p>
        <p>''That's why they paid him $6 million a year to come here,'' Daneyko said.</p>
        <p>Joseph has been proving his worth throughout the series. In Game 3, which the Devils won by 5-1, Joseph did not play all that badly. Instead, his teammates provided little defensive support. The Leafs -- much like the Buffalo Sabres, who rode on Dominik Hasek's shoulders to the Stanley Cup finals last season -- are built around their goaltender.</p>
        <p>Knowing that Joseph is there to cover their backs, the Leafs thrive on an all-out offensive style.</p>
        <p>''I hear a lot of people who follow Toronto saying that Joseph is the key, and that with him all they need is a few goals to win,'' said Scott Stevens, the Devils' captain. ''They don't mind giving up odd-man rushes. That's why Toronto likes a wide-open style of game. They love to go up and down because they have Joseph back there. And for the most part, we're not playing that game.''</p>
        <p>And still the Devils cannot pull away from Toronto.</p>
        <p>''We feel they didn't win the games,'' Robinson said. ''We gave them those games.''</p>
        <p>Despite having Brodeur, who is considered one of the game's elite goaltenders, in goal, the Devils rely on controlling the tempo of the game. When the Devils are at their best, they make it difficult for teams to move up the ice, they trap to force turnovers in the neutral zone and they pounce on the counterattack to score goals.</p>
        <p>''It's important for us to play a certain way,'' Robinson said. ''Making the game simple, being physical, moving the puck quickly, not trading chances.''</p>
        <p>Why not, Robinson was asked?</p>
        <p>''Because I think that's not our game,'' he said. ''That's Toronto's style. That style doesn't suit the players we have.''</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>Devils Coach LARRY ROBINSON said SERGEI BRYLIN, who has been out since April 16 with a knee injury and the flu, will return to the Devils' lineup for Saturday night's Game 4 of the second round. Brylin will rejoin BOBBY HOLIK and RANDY McKAY on the all-important line that has been matched against Toronto's top line of JONAS HOGLUND, MATS SUNDIN and STEVE THOMAS. The rookie STEVE KELLY, who had been playing in Brylin's place, will be scratched. . . . Toronto Coach PAT QUINN left open the possibility of scratching WENDEL CLARK from the lineup Saturday. . . . PETR SYKORA hugged MARTIN BRODEUR when Brodeur finally regained his feet after Sykora accidentally hurt him with a shot Friday. ''It's not a good idea to hurt your No. 1 goalie in practice,'' Sykora said. ''It looked bad. But it wasn't that bad.''</p>
