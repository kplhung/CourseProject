        <p>BRITAIN: BLAIR VOWS COOPERATION -- Prime Minister Tony Blair promised to work with Ken Livingstone, the left-wing maverick he tried to keep off the ballot but who won the race for London's first elected mayor with 58 percent of the final vote. Mr. Blair also acknowledged that Conservative success in winning back some 600 of the 3,300 local council seats across England represented ''some bad results.'' But Conservatives suffered a shock loss of a parliamentary seat in the one by-election, in Romsey, southeast England, where the winner was a Liberal Democrat.</p>

        <p>BRITAIN: $3 MILLION LEGAL BILL -- The historian David Irving, who lost a libel case against Penguin Books and the American academic Deborah Lipstadt last month, was ordered to begin paying their legal costs, estimated at more than $3 million. Justice Charles Gray, who ruled that Mr. Irving, 62, was a racist and a Holocaust denier, gave him until June 16 to pay a first installment of $231,000. If Mr. Irving, left, cannot pay, he will be forced to declare bankruptcy.</p>

        <p>RUSSIA: READY FOR CHECHEN ATTACKS -- Russian forces in Chechnya are preparing for attacks by Islamic guerrillas timed to coincide with the May 9 holiday marking Russia's World War II defeat of Germany, the Interior Ministry said. Security has been increased after intelligence reports that the rebels may try sabotage. Russia says about 3,500 guerrillas remain in Chechnya, but it has been unable to completely shield even northern roads and installations from attacks.</p>

        <p>FRANCE: 10 HELD IN McDONALD'S BLASTS -- Investigating two McDonald's restaurant bombings in Brittany that left one person dead, the police have detained some 10 people for questioning. Those detained include Basques and suspected Breton separatists. Small groups of Breton separatists are seeking autonomy. Two Breton groups have denied responsibility for a blast April 19 that killed a 27-year-old McDonald's employee.</p>

        <p>ETHIOPIA, ERITREA: TALKS COLLAPSE -- Ethiopia said talks with Eritrea being held in Algiers to try to end their two-year border conflict had collapsed. Algeria said the talks had been adjourned. There was no immediate comment from Eritrea.</p>

        <p>ETHIOPIA: NEW FOOD THREAT -- Ethiopians starving after a prolonged drought are now being threatened by heavy rains that are crippling food deliveries, an aid official said. Southeast Ethiopia, one of the areas hit hardest by the three-year drought, has seen two days of downpours, said Vincent Nicod of the International Committee of the Red Cross. ''In the short term, if the rain continues, we might see an increase in people dying,'' he said.</p>

        <p>BRAZIL: EX-FIRST LADY SENTENCED -- A court has sentenced the former first lady Rosane Collor de Mello to an 11-year prison term on charges of taking kickbacks and diverting money from the relief agency she ran during her husband's presidency. Fernando Collor de Mello was impeached in 1992 after his brother accused him of taking millions of dollars from companies bidding for government contracts. Lawyers for Mrs. Collor, who has been in exile in Miami with her husband, said she would appeal.</p>

        <p>BRAZIL: FISCAL LAW SIGNED -- In a major advance for the government's effort to bring budget deficits under control as promised in a 1998 accord with the International Monetary Fund, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso has signed a ''fiscal responsibility law'' that puts strict limits on spending by states. The law caps government salaries, sets fines for officeholders who violate those ceilings and prohibits state governors from increasing budget outlays unless there is a rise in tax revenues.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: CAMPAIGNING IN U.S. -- The two leading opposition presidential candidates headed to the United States to campaign for the allegiances of Mexicans north of the border, hoping that millions of expatriates might influence the votes of their relatives living in Mexico. Vicente Fox, a centrist who was governor of Guanajuato, was to campaign in Chicago and Los Angeles. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, a leftist former Mexico City mayor, was to tour Southern California.</p>

        <p>ARGENTINA: NATIONAL STRIKE -- Dissident union members began a nationwide strike in opposition to labor reform legislation proposed by President Fernando de la Rua. The strike, led by the head of the truckers' union, Hugo Moyano, was limited in impact, but buses in major urban centers and the nation's flagship airline cut back on services.</p>

        <p>NICARAGUA, HONDURAS: BORDER PACT -- The two countries have agreed to mark their territories in the Pacific Ocean, ending one of several maritime boundary battles, the Nicaraguan Foreign Ministry said. The two countries will buy 15 buoys to mark the division in the Gulf of Fonseca, which is used by fishermen from both countries, the ministry said. Officials did not say when the buoys would be put in place. Honduras and Nicaragua have longstanding disputes on both Caribbean and Pacific maritime boundaries.</p>

        <p>ASIA</p>
        <p>AFGHANISTAN: SPYING FOR U.S. -- An Arab arrested in Afghanistan confessed on videotape that the United States recruited him to find Osama bin Laden, who is accused of terrorism. The Associated Press has reviewed the tape, made by a camera crew working for United Arab Emirates Television. The television reporters said the prisoner also told them he provided information that led to the Taliban's arrest of an American spy.</p>

        <p>ISRAEL: SRI LANKA TIES -- Israel and Sri Lanka will resume diplomatic ties, and officials from Colombo are expected to visit next week and deliver a plea for immediate military aid. The Sri Lankans, who cut off officials relations with Israel in 1990 but renewed a military procurement relationship in 1995, are requesting Kfir fighter jets and small sea craft to arm the country in its defensive battle against Tamil rebels.</p>
