        <p>The Boston Herald revised its indefinite suspension of a consumer affairs and transportation columnist today to two weeks without pay.</p>
        <p>The columnist, Robin Washington, was suspended earlier this week after speaking publicly about his demotion to general assignment reporter, a change he linked to a series of articles he wrote about a bank merger. He is expected to return to work as a columnist on May 14.</p>
        <p>The suspension had prompted 75 Herald employees represented by the Newspaper Guild of Greater Boston to sign a petition to the publisher protesting the ''apparent unethical influence of advertisers'' in the newspaper's coverage of the merger of two banks, Fleet Financial and BankBoston. The guild said it would continue to fight the suspension.</p>
