        <p>ON top of everything else, the coffee was not ready for Benjamin Demps Jr., the superintendent of the beleaguered Kansas City School District, as he arrived in his office early yesterday, charged with fixing educational woes here that have endured for decades.</p>
        <p>''Not a good sign for the day,'' said Mr. Demps, 65, whose schools have essentially been judged a failure by a state review board, which stripped them of its seal of accreditation on Monday.</p>
        <p>On the job for 10 months, Mr. Demps is a former air traffic controller who rose to become a high-ranking federal aviation official before turning his attention to the school problems in Kansas City.</p>
        <p>''All I'm asking for is patience,'' said the chief of schools that have been under a court desegregation order stemming from a lawsuit filed in 1977. ''I don't mind the criticism -- that comes with the job. I've got confidence in what I'm doing. When you've been an air traffic controller, and you need to bring down the plane safely, you have to trust your own judgment.''</p>
        <p>The son of a laborer who grew up near Central Park in New York City, Mr. Demps joined the Air Force after graduating from Stuyvesant High School in 1951, and later went to work as an air traffic controller, rising into management ranks. Going back to school as a married man with two daughters, Mr. Demps earned a college diploma at age 32, and a law degree at age 48.</p>
        <p>He has also served as Oklahoma's secretary of health and human services.</p>
        <p>The State Education Board removed the accreditation from the Kansas City District after its schools failed each of 11 performance standards, including test scores and attendance.</p>
        <p>The move means that the district has two years to show significant improvement, or face the prospect of being abolished by the State Legislature and broken into smaller districts. The action also means that students in the district are eligible to attend suburban districts, and that the Kansas City District must pay tuition and transportation costs.</p>
        <p>Acknowledging the problems in the Kansas City system -- similar to those, he noted, that endure in most urban centers -- Mr. Demps nonetheless bristles about the timing of the state board's action.</p>
        <p>''They make it official in May -- three weeks before the school year ends,'' he said. ''I'm incensed for our graduating seniors. They've gone to school all these years, and just before their graduation, this happens.'' Mr. Demps said state education officials insisted that the loss of accreditation would not harm the college prospects of Kansas City graduates, who can expect admission based on test results.</p>
        <p>But the superintendent is not so sanguine. ''When colleges have 50 students for 25 spots,'' he said, ''they've got to look at something, and maybe this will be one of those things.''</p>
        <p>In the national debate on ways to remedy problems in urban schools, the Kansas City district has long been an object of scrutiny. Despite spending some $2 billion over the last two decades to better the schools and draw more white students from the suburbs, the Kansas City schools continue to struggle, and three-quarters of the students are still members of racial minority groups.</p>
        <p>In trying to satisfy federal court demands to draw more white students, and to narrow the performance gaps between whites and blacks, the district has spent lavishly on new buildings and created special magnet schools, like one focusing on Greek studies.</p>
        <p>Missouri lawmakers outside Kansas City have long complained about the city schools' drawing a disproportionate share of education spending. Meanwhile, many residents of Kansas City, especially blacks, have complained that the spending focused too much on attracting white students, and not enough on improving basic education for all.</p>
        <p>Stepping into the firestorm, Mr. Demps, who earns $156,000 a year, has grown accustomed to fierce criticism. For example, Clinton Adams, a black lawyer and leader of a group of dissatisfied parents, has labeled the Demps administration ''feebleminded.''</p>
        <p>''Some people are skeptical because I'm not from Kansas City, I'm not a Missourian -- 'Who is this guy?' '' said Mr. Demps, who was a high-ranking federal civil aviation official in Belgium between 1985 and 1991. His wife, Patricia Demps, is a lawyer for Kerr-McGee. He has a daughter in Norman, Okla., and a daughter in Belgium.</p>
        <p>Acknowledging that some people believe that a superintendent should have had experience as a teacher, or a principal, Mr. Demps said his role was that of a leader of the education forces.</p>
        <p>''Does the general necessarily know how to drive the tank?'' he asked. ''Maybe not. But he knows how to lead the troops.''</p>
        <p>BESIDES coping with the loss of accreditation, Mr. Demps is working these days to build ties with civic and academic leaders, people he believes can help city schools with their resources and suggestions.</p>
        <p>To improve attendance, his administration now works with the police on truancy sweeps to find young people who are playing hooky during school hours. He said he had also sent a message to teachers and administrators that academic standards simply could not be compromised.</p>
        <p>Citing a recent improvement in attendance, he said he was hoping that other improvements would come swiftly. Results of important standardized tests, which students just completed, will become known in the fall.</p>
        <p>''So there's a lot of anxiety around here,'' he said. ''How did we do? We just don't know yet.''</p>
        <p>The problems in the Kansas City schools are not much different from those confronting other big city districts, he said, and the solutions are just as difficult to achieve.</p>
        <p>''We're not doing well in Kansas City,'' he said. ''The difference here is that we're attacking it openly. You've got to say, 'We've got a problem here, gang. Let's get this train going in the right direction.' ''</p>
