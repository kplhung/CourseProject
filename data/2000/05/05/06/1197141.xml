        <p>Jake Heggie, the San Francisco-based composer best known for his art songs, has benefited immeasurably from the devotion he has attracted from important singers. That devotion was palpable on Monday night when the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center presented five fine singers in an evening of Mr. Heggie's songs, most of them accompanied by the composer at the piano, a program essentially drawn from a 1999 RCA Red Seal recording: ''The Faces of Love: The Songs of Jake Heggie.''</p>
        <p>Just a few years ago, Mr. Heggie, now 39, was working full time in the publicity department of the San Francisco Opera. Naturally, many of the important singers of the day came through the office regularly, and there they met this charming, serious young man who was composing songs galore. Several admirably curious singers, like Frederica von Stade, Renee Fleming, Jennifer Larmore, Brian Asawa and others, took a personal interest in Mr. Heggie's music. With such illustrious supporters, getting a coveted recording and important concert engagements was made much easier.</p>
        <p>That said, good things may be coming to Mr. Heggie too quickly. The songs performed on Monday night were variable in quality, and sometimes marred by sentimentality. He certainly knows how to write floating, singer-friendly lines for the female voice.</p>
        <p>A sensitive and facile pianist, he gives the impression of someone to whom music comes easily. Perhaps too easily. His harmonic language, rooted in tonality, is spiked with astringent bits of dissonance and enriched with murky Impressionistic colors. But the wistful, dreamy and accessible language that results is not particularly fresh. Mr. Heggie draws heavily on jazz, pop, Broadway and folk styles. But employing vernacular sources begins to seem like an easy way to give his songs an American jolt.</p>
        <p>Take ''In the Beginning'' from ''Of Gods and Cats,'' which opened the program. Gavin Geoffrey Dillard's poems are cloyingly cute (''In the beginning was the cat and the cat was without purr''). With its jazz-riff bass pattern and slinky melody, the song gave the mezzo-soprano Jennifer Larmore license to do an embarrassing imitation of a jazz vocalist, complete with Eartha Kitt cat purrs. Many of Mr. Heggie's songs rely on the built-in humor of a concert diva letting down her hair, singing scat, vocal sighs, hums and insinuating ah's. It can get pretty forced.</p>
        <p>''To Say Before Going to Sleep'' represents Mr. Heggie at his best. Befitting this Rilke poem in translation, the song is compact and direct; the melodic is lyrical without being indulgently so. Its harmonic pungency is evidence of Mr. Heggie's ear working acutely. Here less is more.</p>
        <p>Ms. von Stade sang two song cycles. One, ''Paper Wings,'' with text of her own, recounts incidents from life with her daughter, and though the songs are slight Ms. von Stade sang them radiantly. The other, ''Song to the Moon,'' played here by the pianist Martin Katz, is set to fairy tale poems by Vachel Lindsay. You have to have a taste for the fanciful to appreciate the work, rendered with cackling animal sounds and hopscotch hand claps.</p>
        <p>There was also an excerpt, sung by the sopranos Kristin Clayton and Nicolle Foland, from ''Dead Man Walking,'' Mr. Heggie's opera, with a libretto by the playwright Terrence McNally, which is to receive its premiere at the San Francisco Opera in October. Mr. McNally is another important artist whose support has clearly helped Mr. Heggie win invaluable opportunities. Now it's up to him to make the most of them.</p>
