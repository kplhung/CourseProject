        <p>To the gray-haired woman in the rose-print housedress, the appearance of the nurse at nearby St. Bernard's Church was a miracle.</p>
        <p>''She really saved my life,'' said Anita Horigan, soon after hugging Mary Ellen Smith, the parish nurse at the Catholic church, on West 14th Street in Manhattan. When Miss Horigan, who gave her age as 86 or 87, was what she called ''really very down'' recently, Ms. Smith arranged for her to be screened for depression and to speak with a psychiatrist.</p>
        <p>''This was nearby, and came just at the time I thought I was at the bottom of the ladder,'' said Miss Horigan, who does not think she would have found help through the more traditional routes. ''To me, it was a miracle that she was there.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Smith deflected the credit. ''To me, I blame it on the Holy Spirit,'' she said. ''Certain things are meant to be.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Smith, 43, is one of a small group of parish nurses in the city, part of a growing international contingent that includes more than 3,000 nurses affiliated with places of worship in the United States, Canada, Australia and Korea. About half of them volunteer their services. The nurses work to improve the physical and spiritual health of the whole person, and try to reach people who might otherwise go unserved, especially as hospital stays are shorter and social programs harder to come by.</p>
        <p>Ms. Smith, who wears a Claddagh ring that hints at her Irish heritage (though she leaves little room for doubt), is a part-time parish nurse employed by St. Vincents Hospital and Medical Center on Seventh Avenue and 12th Street, which she calls ''St. Vinnie's.''</p>
        <p>She is assigned to St. Bernard's on Tuesdays, Wednesdays and Fridays, and is on call for other hospitals on other days. She starts her day at 8 a.m. by calling ''one of the guys'' in the parish to ask about his wife's health. Ms. Smith's services, which are free, are announced in the parish bulletin. On her schedule are visits to the hospital and area nursing homes, frequent blood pressure screenings, flu shots in season, daily Mass, weekly bingo games, and strolls around the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Sure enough, on Wednesday, there was John Monahan, a parishioner she expects to see on 14th Street whenever alternate-side-of-the-street parking regulations are in effect. She saw him again a few minutes later, scraping off lottery cards in front of Flannery's Bar, where Ms. Smith had left business cards and fliers about health screenings.</p>
        <p>Such strategies have worked well. A young woman came up to her once, acting a little tipsy, holding a crumpled business card with Ms. Smith's name on it. The woman had not had a checkup in a while, and was asking for one. ''She said, 'You made a good name for yourself in the bar,' '' Ms. Smith recalled, pleased by the compliment, and by being able to refer the woman to the services she needed. Any way to reach people makes Ms. Smith happy, even if it involves establishing credibility through barroom buzz.</p>
        <p>Parish nursing began in the mid-1980's in the suburbs of Chicago and is reaching more urban areas, though slowly. It is difficult to determine the number of parish nurses in New York City, because many work as part-time volunteers for a variety of faiths.</p>
        <p>''I'm hearing about it more in the rural areas,'' said Mary O. Mundinger, dean of the Columbia University School of Nursing. ''People have more sophisticated and long-term needs out of the hospital than they did before.'' She said the need for parish nurses appeared to be greater than ever, as more older people who are connected to a parish but do not have family nearby come to rely on charity instead of Medicaid.</p>
        <p>Virginia Wepfer, chairwoman of the parish nurse section of Health Ministries Association, an interfaith membership organization based in Atlanta, said having easy access to a nurse gave parishioners peace of mind. ''It gives permission for people to say, 'I've got dizziness that I think is from my medicine,' or 'My son is acting weird, do you really think he is on drugs? What do you know about them?' or 'I'm really worried about my husband. Can you just come by and pray with us?' ''</p>
        <p>The need for such services is tremendous, Ms. Wepfer said, especially with the prevalence of health maintenance organizations. ''People just have so many questions and concerns. They need help to walk through the medical maze,'' she said. ''Half the time they can't get through to their own doctor. It's serious.''</p>
        <p>Through her free-of-charge work with neighborhood residents (predominantly Hispanic and Irish people, including widows of West Side dock workers), Ms. Smith, who followed her mother into nursing, attests to the power of prayer in the healing process. She remembers praying with one hospital patient who asked her to. ''It's nice to be able to do it, and nice that you can mention God and be safe about it. I'm not a fanatic, but let's give justice to where justice is due,'' she said. ''I've seen people who have gotten well who weren't supposed to.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Smith, who lives on Staten Island with a roommate and a cat, charms her patients, especially the older women who come to bingo early, armed with purses full of colored markers, and get their blood pressure checked. ''I'm proud of you, bringing this!'' she said to a player who brought her pill bottles for Ms. Smith to see. ''Good girl! You made my day! You're a poster child, somebody who knows their medication!''</p>
        <p>The Rev. Ken Smith, pastor of St. Bernard's, said the nurse had given tremendous service to his church, which has about 2,000 people.</p>
        <p>''We have a constant flow of people here when she's here,'' he said. ''She's had a very positive effect on the parish. Mary Ellen is a person who has a very deep faith. She sees healing in the light of the ministry of the church. Given the fact that the church brought into existence the hospitals in Middle Ages, I think the church has always seen physical healing as part of her ministry.''</p>
        <p>Sister Karen Helfenstein, senior vice president for mission at St. Vincents, said the parish nurse program, financed by the Alfred E. Smith Memorial Foundation and the hospital auxiliary, was in the process of expanding. Ms. Smith is now the hospital's only parish nurse.</p>
        <p>''In healing communities, people are praying for each other, and it's all about fixing broken hearts,'' she said. ''Hospitals are about fixing broken bones.''</p>
        <p>Sister Karen spoke of the trust people traditionally have put in their churches. ''The priest, the minister, the shaman in the old model, were all a combination of priests and doctors. I think people do feel that these are people I can trust.''</p>
        <p>Down in the parish hall, before bingo, Ms. Smith was taking blood pressures. ''How ya doing, baby? Sign in! Muy bien,'' she said to a man who spoke little English. She took his blood pressure and recorded it in her files. She remembers one bingo player who got his blood sugar levels checked during Diabetic Alert Day, who is now on insulin.</p>
        <p>''What I love about this job is how many people in their 70's, 80's and 90's there are in this area, staying home with minimal care,'' she said. ''Realistically, I've gotten to see people leave a nursing home -- go there and then come home.''</p>
        <p>She takes heart from an older, more polite bingo player who recently encountered a mugger. '' 'Give me your [expletive] money,' he said to her,'' Ms. Smith recalled, ''and she yelled back, 'I don't have any [expletive] money.' '' He backed off.</p>
        <p>Some of her work requires talking people down when they are upset about a doctor's orders. ''The blood pressure medicine worked, that was the answer there,'' Ms. Smith said to one woman who was flustered about her hypertension. ''This could work, would that be so terrible? You're questioning him. He wants you to be around 130, don't focus on the high number. Take the medicine. Don't get stuck on the numbers. Please, you're making yourself sick.''</p>
        <p>Later, the woman said of Ms. Smith: ''She puts up with me, she's excellent. She's interested in everyone.''</p>
