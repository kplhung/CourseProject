        <p>It has been one of the most turbulent weeks in Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's 55 years. He met with more doctors to determine his treatment for prostate cancer, acknowledged at a news briefing that he has a ''very good'' female friend, fended off questions about his wife's postponement of her starring role in ''The Vagina Monologues,'' and stepped outside the gates of Gracie Mansion shortly before midnight on Wednesday to talk of his sadness at the loss of a friend, Cardinal John O'Connor.</p>
        <p>And, not least, he made two trips upstate in his campaign for United States Senate against the first lady.</p>
        <p>Next week promises more. Mr. Giuliani's advisers say the mayor's campaign schedule and four big California fund-raisers in mid-May give him until late next week to announce his plans for treatment and which way he is leaning about staying in the race. Most of his advisers say his concerns about his health have made the Senate race and the news about his female friend of the last year, Judith Nathan, less important for now.</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said as much yesterday during his weekly radio call-in show. In response to a question from ''Keith from Washington Heights,'' Mr. Giuliani recounted how he had been asked during a campaign stop last week in Saratoga Springs whether he saw his cancer as an opportunity to get out of the Senate race and run for governor in 2002.</p>
        <p>''I can't tell you how profoundly off base all that is,'' Mr. Giuliani said. ''If you understand anything about someone that is trying to focus on cancer, what it means, how to deal with it, how to deal with it effectively, you would know that that becomes the thing that you focus on as intelligently and as focused a way as you possibly can.''</p>
        <p>At the same time, City Hall advisers describe the self-contained and often short-tempered mayor as unusually warm, solicitous and even affectionate. ''He comes in in the morning and he'll throw his arm around one of the deputy mayors and give him a hug,'' said one mayoral adviser who insisted on anonymity because he did not want to be identified as passing on City Hall secrets, even ones flattering to the mayor. ''He says hello to everyone and shakes everyone's hands. He seems happier. It's weird.''</p>
        <p>Advisers say that since Mr. Giuliani's announcement of his diagnosis,  he is listening more to them at staff  meetings, thanking them for their contributions and asking about their welfare. And while no one is predicting that Mr. Giuliani's mood will last, he himself addressed the change after his diagnosis in one of his increasingly reflective, and friendly, comments to reporters last week.</p>
        <p>''I don't know if it has changed me in any way,'' he said at a campaign stop last weekend in Buffalo. ''I think when you face news like this, and you absorb it, it changes you. I think it changes you in a good way.''</p>
        <p>But his advisers, who last week said the mayor's battle with cancer could give him the kick and focus he needed for the race, are now saying they have no idea what he will do. Mr. Giuliani, they said, does not yet know himself.</p>
        <p>''One of the advantages that I have, and it gets you through all kinds of difficulties and problems and maybe it's the only way to get through them, is to just be honest,'' Mr. Giuliani said in a long, introspective answer to ''Keith from Washington Heights'' on his radio show. ''You know, like, be honest with yourself, say what you think, and then you can reflect on it that way personally, and you don't end up dividing yourself into two or three different people.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said that he had spent most of Thursday ''going though evaluations'' for his treatment, that he ''would very much like'' to run, that he expected to raise as much as $32 million for the race -- he already has $20 million -- and added, ''I am not thinking about any other office.'' He said he was a ''very, very strong supporter'' of Gov. George E. Pataki, who ''in this difficulty'' had been ''very kind and generous to me, above and beyond everything else.'' He added: ''If you know me at all, you know that personal loyalty is the single most important thing. Nothing is more important than that.''</p>
        <p>Advisers and associates of the mayor say Mr. Giuliani, in acknowledging his relationship with Ms. Nathan earlier this week, evidently wanted it to become known because he was taking her to such highly public events as town hall meetings and the annual Inner Circle dinner, attended by reporters, politicians and hundreds of other guests.</p>
        <p>Some advisers say the acknowledgment was timed to get the matter out in the open a full six months before the election, and came at a time when Mr. Giuliani's battle with cancer had generated so much sympathy, even among his longtime enemies. Mr. Giuliani, they said, cannot be charged with political hypocrisy because he has not made ''family values'' a part of his campaign, and has made no secret of his estrangement from his wife, Donna Hanover.</p>
        <p>Stephen Minarik, the Monroe County Republican chairman, said yesterday in Rochester that Mr. Giuliani's relationship with Ms. Nathan was getting no coverage in Rochester and that it would not matter to voters.</p>
        <p>''People don't care about the personal stuff,'' Mr. Minarik said. ''I don't know what the mayor's relationship is with his wife. I've never asked him. It's none of my business.''</p>
        <p>But one political consultant to Democrats and Republicans in New York City said yesterday that the mayor's relationship with Ms. Nathan could harm him with women and Catholics upstate. ''Because I think there's a tendency for women to look askance upstate in heavily Catholic areas,'' the consultant said.</p>
