        <p>The idea behind bringing the Vienna Philharmonic to play Beethoven's Ninth Symphony at the site of the former Nazi camp in Mauthausen, Austria, was to promote reconciliation at the dawn of a new century. But in Jorg Haider's Austria, the plan has divided the country and sparked anguished debate.</p>
        <p>Elie Wiesel has canceled his plans to attend the concert on Sunday because of the presence of Mr. Haider's rightist Freedom Party in the government, and critics of the idea have sharpened their attacks on a performance they call an insult to memory rather than a means to transcend the past.</p>
        <p>''Anything that changes this unique slaughterhouse on Austrian soil into a concert house is tasteless to say the least,'' said Marta Halpert, director of the central European office of the Anti-Defamation League in Vienna. ''The notion of Philharmonic musicians in striped pants sitting in the quarry where so many died is grotesque.''</p>
        <p>More than 100,000 people died at Mauthausen between 1939 and 1945. Many of them perished after being driven to a state of skeletal exhaustion through slave labor in the stone quarry at the site. The camp was used primarily for political opponents of Hitler, although many Jews ended up there after the ''death marches'' of the war's end.</p>
        <p>The controversy has been sharpened by the particular history of the Vienna Philharmonic, which performed Beethoven's ''Fidelio'' at the express request of Hermann Goring 10 days after the Anschluss in 1938. The orchestra harbored many openly Nazi members, responded with equanimity to the deportation to death camps of six Jewish members and for decades after the war turned a same blind eye to these events, as did most Austrians.</p>
        <p>But Clemens Hellsberg, the Philharmonic's president, who has done much to throw belated light on the orchestra's dark years under Hitler's Reich, has defended the concert as a sign of hope for a new millennium and an educational gesture.</p>
        <p>''We must sensitize the eyes and ears and especially the hearts of people to need and misery in this world,'' he said in a recent interview with Die Presse. When the orchestra was criticized at a performance in Paris shortly after Mr. Haider entered government in February, he pointed to the Mauthausen event as proof of its credentials.</p>
        <p>Sir Simon Rattle, the British conductor who will soon take over from Claudio Abbado at the Berlin Philharmonic, will conduct the performance, one that has led Sir Simon to a great deal of soul searching. He declined to be interviewed, but earlier this year he told The Guardian that in the end silence was not an option for a musician offered such a rare opportunity.</p>
        <p>''I think we will be reaching into ourselves to try to express what is necessary through the music,'' he said then. ''When the alternative is silence, there isn't really an alternative for a musician.''</p>
        <p>Sir Simon added: ''It's retreat or resist, and now is the time to resist. To do anything else would play into the hands of reaction and racism.''</p>
        <p>The Viennese-born conductor Rudolf Schwarz, who survived Auschwitz, was one of Sir Simon's chief mentors and his educator in the reality of the Holocaust. Sir Simon seems to believe that the concert is consistent with Mr. Schwarz's lifelong determination to bear witness and so ensure that there is never again a Mauthausen on European soil.</p>
        <p>The idea for the concert originally came from Leon Zelman, a Jew from Vienna who survived Auschwitz and Mauthausen. He now leads an organization that tries to draw Jews expelled in 1938 and their descendants back to the city.</p>
        <p>''The dead of Mauthausen were mainly freedom fighters who died for a certain vision of Europe, and on the eve of a new millennium I wanted to do something for this dream of a new Europe,'' he said. ''The Ninth Symphony is the hymn of Europe.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Haider's Freedom Party, a coalition partner in the Austrian government, has taken a clear stance against further European integration. It has also criticized the Uberfremdung -- a word dear to the Nazis that roughly means over-foreignerization -- of Austria.</p>
        <p>Mr. Zelman said that no one from the government had been invited to the event because of the Freedom Party's presence. Mr. Haider has generally avoided mentioning the concert, as have the ministers.</p>
        <p>Explaining his decision not to attend, Mr. Wiesel said earlier this year, ''In a country where there is a Mauthausen, there should not be a Haider.'' But he has sent a message that will be read before the concert  asking the question: What turned ''good fathers and loyal husbands'' into coldblooded Nazi murderers?</p>
        <p>Because the camp is the Interior Ministry's responsibility, it has fallen to the uninvited government to prepare the quarry for the concert, employing engineers to improve the acoustics. More than 7,000 people are expected to attend, and video screens for live transmission have been set up in Vienna, Linz and Innsbruck.</p>
        <p>''This is the worst sort of event culture, like taking the three tenors to the Baths of Caracalla,'' said Ms. Halpert. ''You can hear the screams in the quarry. You should not make any other sounds.''</p>
        <p>Her stance has been broadly supported by Helmut Edelmayr, who leads the Austrian Association of Prison Camps. He will take part in a ceremony before the concert commemorating the 55th anniversary of the liberation of the camp.</p>
        <p>''The survivors see this place as a de facto graveyard,'' he said. ''And in graveyards such events are not held.''</p>
