        <p>With all the surprise of a spring rainstorm, Gov. John G. Rowland vetoed a bill today that would have established voluntary spending limits for state political campaigns and used millions in public money to pay for them.</p>
        <p>Though expected by leaders of both political parties, the veto by Mr. Rowland, a Republican, disappointed  the bill's proponents, mostly Democrats who control the state's General Assembly and a coalition of nonprofit groups that said the bill would have reduced the influence of money and special interests on state government.</p>
        <p>''Most of us are outraged that he's vetoed it,'' said Karen Hobert Flynn, the director of Common Cause, a nonprofit good-government group that campaigned hard for the bill with dozens of other groups. ''It's unfortunate that he's left the scandalous campaign finance system intact in Connecticut.''</p>
        <p>Connecticut's bill would not have mandated spending limits, but would have suggested voluntary limits, beginning in 2002, for almost all state elective offices. The bill's proponents said that peer and public pressure would have kept candidates from exceeding the limits.</p>
        <p>Under the terms of the bill, beginning in 2006 a party's gubernatorial ticket could spend up to $7.5 million from a public fund for a primary and a general election race. Had the bill passed, it would have placed Connecticut among the few states that use public money and set voluntary spending limits for political races.</p>
        <p>In a seven-page memo enumerating six major reasons for striking down the bill, Mr. Rowland said that the bill did not have bipartisan support, one of the provisions he said he wanted in any campaign finance bill, and that it inappropriately ''diverts taxpayer money from important programs'' -- which he did not identify</p>
        <p>He also said the bill raised ''serious First Amendment issues.''</p>
        <p>''It is questionable whether so-called 'voluntary' spending limits could withstand a constitutional challenge,'' he wrote, though in 1992 Nebraska passed the Campaign Finance Limitation Act that set similarly voluntary spending limits without a court challenge.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rowland also criticized the bill for not including several recommendations from the state election commission to limit contributions from labor unions and corporations, traditional sources of cash for Democrats and Republicans, respectively.</p>
        <p>He said Democrats were wrong to try to link the bill to last year's corruption scandal involving Paul J. Silvester, a former state treasurer and Republican friend of the governor's who pleaded guilty to federal charges that he accepted kickbacks from investment firms with which he did business. A separate bill creating better oversight of the treasurer's office was already signed, Mr. Rowland noted.</p>
        <p>By vetoing the bill, ''We're going to save the taxpayers $40 million dollars,'' the governor said during a taping of a weekly television news program this morning. ''I think that's a pretty good explanation.''</p>
        <p>The memo left many top Democrats seething. The bill would have cost the state far less than $40 million, said Roy Occhiogrosso, a spokesman for the Senate president pro tempore, Kevin B. Sullivan.</p>
        <p>The coalition of nonprofit groups, called Democracy 2000, that fought for the bill would continue pushing for another bill in next year's legislative session, said Ms. Hobert Flynn of Common Cause.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, she said, they would probably contact several prominent members of the Republican caucus in the state House of Representatives, where opposition to the bill was greatest, to discuss a path toward a compromise bill both parties would support.</p>
        <p>''We're not giving up,'' she said.</p>
