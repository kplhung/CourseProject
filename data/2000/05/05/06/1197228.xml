        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''G.O.P. Panel Seeks to Alter Schedule of Primary Voting'' (front page, May 3): The picture on your front page of an empty polling place in Washington, D.C., on the day of its primary and reports of low turnout there and elsewhere made me think that perhaps the number of delegates from each state should be proportional to the number of actual voters.  Thus, a state with a small but politically active population could have a significant say in the process, no matter when the primary was held.</p>

        <p>In addition, the outcome would not be determined as early, as a state in a later round of voting could increase its importance to the process by increasing its turnout. The system would reward civic responsibility and would provide a greater incentive for voting.  It would also represent the will of actual voters rather than a representative sample of the population.</p>
