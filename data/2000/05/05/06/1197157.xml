        <p>Robert D. Putnam, a political scientist at Harvard University, is a big, red-faced, enthusiastic man with the Amish whiskers and explosive gestures of a 19th-century fundamentalist preacher -- useful characteristics for the ''hell will get us if we don't mend our ways'' thesis that has taken over his life in the last five years.</p>
        <p>His message, familiar to millions of Americans, is that the civic engagement -- the neighborhood friendships, the dinner parties, the group discussions, the club memberships, the church committees, the political participation; all the involvements, even the street protests, that make a democracy work -- has declined over the last 30 years. Trust and reciprocity, which Mr. Putnam calls social capital, have been damaged, he says, and the nation has grown cantankerous and less efficient.</p>
        <p>Being a spiritual man, deeply committed to his own findings, he proselytizes. Tapping foundations for funds, Mr. Putnam organizes seminars, surveys ''social connectedness'' in numerous cities (the hope being that local groups will then fix the shortcomings), speaks tirelessly, and generally tries to recreate a modern version of the community bonds that flourished at the turn of the 20th century and again after World War II.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to say that I am a Jane Addams or a John Dewey, but I aspire to that role,'' Mr. Putnam said, naming two turn-of-the-century social reformers who were both scholars and doers. ''In academia now it has become a less prestigious activity to be concerned about social reforms.''</p>
        <p>The first time Mr. Putnam put forth his message, in an academic article published five years ago, he caught lots of attention, as much for the title, ''Bowling Alone,'' as for the findings. People bowled more frequently than before, he had learned, but they bowled with their children or with a few friends: basically alone. What had declined were the organized leagues and the lively conversations and social interaction over beer and pizza that the leagues had fostered.</p>
        <p>''Bowling Alone'' touched a public nerve and became a metaphor for a much larger national malaise. Mr. Putnam suddenly found himself profiled in People magazine. He appeared on talk shows, and President Clinton invited him to Camp David. Most recently both Al Gore and George W. Bush have tapped him for advice, or their aides have.</p>
        <p>''They know perfectly well, these politicians, that Americans are worried about their communities,'' Mr. Putnam said over lunch recently, putting down his fork to emphasize his point forcefully with both hands. ''They know that if they could come up with some coherent response, there is a market for that politically.''</p>
        <p>Despite the political appeal, that first paper drew plenty of criticism. His evidence was faulty and too sparse, some said. He failed to appreciate the new forms of civic participation that had emerged in the late 20th century, others argued. There was concern that the decline in church activity, for example, once a big source of civic engagement, might only mean that organized religion no longer spoke to people's needs as did, say, self-help groups like Gamblers Anonymous or Weight Watchers. (These have proliferated.)</p>
        <p>But now Mr. Putnam, after five more years of research, has reaffirmed his original conclusions and supported them with greatly expanded data, all presented in a new book, ''Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community'' (Simon &amp; Schuster), sent to stores this week. The criticism has not gone away, but critics of Mr. Putnam's concepts who have read galley proofs of the book said that it would almost certainly become the framework for a revived debate about civic engagement.</p>
        <p>''He is definitely right that a lot of our connections with one another are more tenuous than they used to be, and he is right, in his final chapter, to call us to task,'' said Robert Wuthnow, a Princeton University sociologist. ''But he has a single-minded thesis that fails to paint the complex picture that actually exists.''</p>
        <p>He ignores, for example, the proliferation of nonprofit groups, ''from soup kitchens to private schools to foundations to think tanks to social welfare organizations,'' Mr. Wuthnow said. ''These are mostly small, and they function like the civic groups that Putnam says are declining.''</p>
        <p>Some nonprofits do function that way, but others are created in wills to avoid estate taxes, Mr. Putnam replies. At 59, he has sampled the post-World War II stages of civic engagement, from its heyday in the late 1940's and 50's, when he was growing up in Port Clinton, Ohio, a rural town on Lake Erie, to its decline, which he has experienced mostly as a resident of Lexington, Mass., a Boston suburb. As a teenager he bowled on Saturdays in a league. A photo of his five-member team, recently found among his mother's belongings, decorates the jacket of his new book. Two of the boys are black. (Mr. Putnam is white.)</p>
        <p>''The fact of the matter is that bowling leagues, even in the 1950's, did bring people together, across class lines; it is the least class-specific sport in America,'' he said. ''You need this sort of bridging social capital for civic engagement to really work.''</p>
        <p>Whatever the virtues of bowling, Mr. Putnam was not particularly good at it, with scores averaging less than 150 a game. As an adult he has rarely bowled, apart from occasional outings when his two children, now married, were still young: family bowling, not league bowling. Lately, however, in recognition of the publicity his research has brought to the sport, his students celebrate the end of a semester with a bowling party or by giving him bowling knickknacks.</p>
        <p>Others have given him knickknacks, too. He ticks them off: bowling salt and pepper shakers, bowling towels and shoes, books about bowling, jokes about bowling, a tie decorated with a bowling lane. Tchotchkes, he calls them, invoking a Yiddish word, and a reminder that religion has played a big role in civic engagement and his life. Raised a Methodist, he converted to Judaism, his wife's religion, when they married 37 years ago. ''We agreed it was important that we have one religion,'' Rosemary Putnam said.</p>
        <p>Now Mrs. Putnam, 59, a public school special-education teacher, is the one who is civically engaged: playing French horn in the Lexington band, active in her temple's sisterhood, member of a book group, volunteer tutor of immigrants in English, active in a teachers association. Her husband sang in the town chorus for a year or two; but absorbed in his teaching, research and writing, he withdrew, becoming an example of the disengagement he now chronicles.</p>
        <p>The Putnam thesis dwells on the precipitous decline since 1970 of community groups: the Elks, the Rotary, the Masons, the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, the American Legion, parent-teacher associations, local chapters of political parties, religious institutions, softball teams, art groups, union locals, town bands and scores of others. Apart from not joining, people vote less, give fewer dinner parties, and are more likely to have unlisted phone numbers, to sue and to rely on security guards. Trust has in effect declined, and trust is a big element of social capital fostered by civic connectedness, Mr. Putnam argues.</p>
        <p>''Connectedness really matters,'' he said at a White House conference last month. ''Wonderful studies, controlling for your blood chemistry and how old you are and your gender and whether you jog and whether you smoke and so on, show that your chances of dying over the next year are cut in half by joining one group. Cut in a quarter by joining two groups.''</p>
        <p>Much of Mr. Putnam's evidence for the decline in civic engagement came from a huge mass of previously untapped lifestyle surveys compiled over the years by Roper and DDB Needham. Polls designed for marketing and then stored away became in Mr. Putnam's hands historical data on civic engagement. ''If the client was Hallmark, it wanted to know about churchgoing, and food companies wanted to know about family dinner trends,'' Mr. Putnam said.</p>
        <p>Other community activities have grown, of course. Volunteering is one. And children play soccer more than ever, on teams organized by parents, although Mr. Putnam found that ''if every single soccer mom and dad in America went to every single soccer game, that would not be as large a number as the number of people who stopped bowling in leagues.''</p>
        <p>Theda Skocpol, a Harvard sociologist, says that beyond the community, advocacy groups -- organizations like the Sierra Club, the Children's Defense Fund, the American Association of Retired Persons -- have become a new form of social connectedness. They are an outgrowth of the civil rights movement, the anti-Vietnam War protests, women's liberation: issues that the old civic engagement failed to address.</p>
        <p>But she adds that rather than fostering give-and-take conversation, the advocacy groups are run by ''elite people more than ever,'' while the millions of members mail in their dues and contributions. It is a system that ''contributes to the sense of most Americans that everything is going on above their heads,'' Ms. Skocpol said, causing them to pull back from public life.</p>
        <p>Whether Internet communication can reverse this trend, recreating the old conversation in a new format, Mr. Putnam says he does not know. He guesses that the Internet will complement rather than replace face-to-face communications. But he is not sure. ''I am worried,'' he said, ''that I will end up in the long sweep of history having written a book about disconnection at the very moment that technology was changing the equation.''</p>
        <p>Although Mr. Putnam acknowledges that the rise of the two-earner family cuts into time available for civic engagement, economics plays a relatively small role in his scheme. Electronic entertainment, mostly television, gets 25 percent of the blame.</p>
        <p>Just as they bowl alone, people increasingly watch television alone. It isolates. So does suburban sprawl and the additional commuting time, alone in a car, that sprawl requires. People increasingly live in one suburb, work in another and shop at malls in a third location, Mr. Putnam finds.</p>
        <p>The biggest culprit, however, is generational change, he concluded. The Depression and World War II produced a generation of civic-minded Americans. As that generation has aged, giving way to less trustful more isolated Americans, civic engagement and social capital have declined. Still, Mr. Putnam is optimistic. Just as the mass immigration in the late 19th century and the shift from farms to cities resulted in the creation of the community groups and ties now in decline, the new circumstances should create new institutions.</p>
        <p>That leap of faith is greeted with skepticism by Ms. Skocpol and other social scientists. But Mr. Putnam, in his enthusiasm, sees his own efforts and those of a few others engaged in community organization as the beginning of a revival of the old connectedness in new ways not yet evident. Or as he puts it in the last sentences of his book: ''Henry Ward Beecher's advice a century ago to 'multiply picnics' is not entirely ridiculous today. We should do this, ironically, not because it will be good for America -- though it will be -- but because it will be good for us.''</p>
