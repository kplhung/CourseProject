        <p>Yefim Bronfman is a superlative pianist but, first of all, a superlative musician. At his recital in the Great Performers series at Alice Tully Hall on Sunday afternoon, his performances were beautifully composed and thereby gripping, even though, or because, there was nothing attention-grabbing in them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bronfman deflects his virtuosity into other purposes, including  producing a fine singing tone with his right hand; making his hands work together like voices in dialogue; creating abrupt fortissimos that stay well molded, never clattering; and finding tempos and changes of tempo that make sense in the long term.</p>

        <p>Yefim Bronfman is a superlative pianist but, first of all, a superlative musician. At his recital in the Great Performers series at Alice Tully Hall on Sunday afternoon, his performances were beautifully composed and thereby gripping, even though, or because, there was nothing attention-grabbing in them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bronfman deflects his virtuosity into other purposes, including  producing a fine singing tone with his right hand; making his hands work together like voices in dialogue; creating abrupt fortissimos that stay well molded, never clattering; and finding tempos and changes of tempo that make sense in the long term.</p>
        <p>But these are not just ends in themselves. They are some of the means by which he conveys a remarkable sense of progression within each piece. Beginnings sound like beginnings, or like arrivals from out of the unheard distance (as in the case of the sixth of Berg's Seven Early Songs). After that the journey is continuous, though it may not be smooth: after all, the other composer he was playing was Beethoven.</p>
        <p>The combination of Berg and Beethoven was stimulating. Both were represented by works of early maturity, Berg by his Piano Sonata Opus 1 as well as by the song set, the two works dating from his mid-20's. Beethoven was a few years older when he wrote the earliest piece included here, the Sonata Quasi una Fantasia, but then, he had not had the advantage of Schoenberg's teaching, so important to Berg.</p>
        <p>In both composers, too -- certainly as Mr. Bronfman played them -- the lyric impulse will not be denied. The music keeps breaking out in song, and a lot of composerly work -- and performerly work as well -- has to go into keeping it on track. In a highly inviting Beethoven-Berg program tomorrow afternoon, Mr. Bronfman will perform in chamber pieces by the two composers.</p>
        <p>This time he started and ended with solo works by Beethoven. The C minor Variations, played first, were masterfully integrated: a sequence of pages that were characterful but also going somewhere. The ''Appassionata'' Sonata had an enormous  dynamic range, from the gentleness into which Mr. Bronfman naturally settles to sudden, arresting gestures. The pivotal chord at the turn out of the slow movement was like a huge shaft of light.</p>
        <p>The wholeness of the Berg Sonata was also formidable. Christine Brewer sang the songs a bit too loudly, but with appealing warmth and ardor.</p>
