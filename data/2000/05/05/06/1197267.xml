        <p>Jackson, 35, has been an assistant to the president of Turner Sports for five years and was a protege of Harvey Schiller, the former president of Turner Sports who is the chairman of the YankeeNets. Jackson also worked at the United States Olympic Committee when Schiller was the executive director.</p>
        <p>Last year, Jackson recruited John Thompson, his former coach at Georgetown, to become a basketball analyst at TNT, one of the Turner networks. Thompson has been mentioned as a candidate for the newly created position of director of basketball operations for the Nets. Lenny Wilkens, the former Atlanta coach, also appears to be on the Nets' wish list for the job.</p>
        <p>The Nets are also looking for a new coach to replace Don Casey, who was fired at the end of the season. Michael Rowe, the team's president, was reassigned this week to work on the team's proposed Newark arena.</p>
