        <p>After weeks of speculation over whether she would take the witness stand, Sante Kimes abruptly declined to testify in her murder trial yesterday and accused the judge of making it impossible for her to defend herself.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kimes's surprise decision not to testify was made after her son, Kenneth, who has also been charged with murder, tearfully begged her not to take the stand, said a lawyer close to the case. Her lawyers, Michael Hardy and Jose A. Muniz, also urged Mrs. Kimes not to testify.</p>
        <p>In an outburst while the jury was not in the courtroom, Mrs. Kimes said a ruling yesterday by Justice Rena K. Uviller of State Supreme Court made it impossible for her to testify. She also asked that television cameras be allowed to cover the trial, and that she be allowed to give interviews to reporters, but the judge refused. She accused prosecutors of anonymously releasing information to the news media to sully her and her son's reputations.</p>
        <p>''More than anything in the world, I wanted to take that stand,'' Mrs. Kimes said, her voice quaking with emotion. ''I am this boy's mother and we are innocent and I wanted to take that stand.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kimes, 65, and her son Kenneth, 24, are accused of killing Irene Silverman, an Upper East Side socialite, on July 5, 1998, as part of a sophisticated scheme to steal her  town house. Mrs. Silverman's body has never been found, but prosecutors have presented 129 witnesses and more than 400 pieces of evidence in a three-month trial that they contend has proved that the Kimses committed the murder.</p>
        <p>In her outburst, Mrs. Kimes said she was filled with fear. ''I'm afraid of you, I'm afraid of this corrupt system, I'm afraid of the gossip, the lies, that have been fed about my son and me,'' she said. ''I'm afraid of this! That everybody in New York believes this!''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Kimes then turned to the spectators in the courtroom and held up a headline that ran in The Daily News on March 26: ''Poll: Cops Out of Control -- Need Federal Monitors.'' She then shouted, ''We're innocent! For God's sake, help us!''</p>
        <p>In the ruling that Mrs. Kimes attacked, Justice Uviller decided that prosecutors could ask about her 1986 slavery conviction in Las Vegas if she took the witness stand. But the judge also barred prosecutors from asking Mrs. Kimes about a 1998 killing in Los Angeles that she and her son have been charged with, and two other homicides that they are suspected of committing.</p>
        <p>A lawyer close to the case said the defense felt that the ruling was unfair because the 1986 conviction, which involved enslaving and beating a group of Mexican immigrants, involved acts so repugnant that it could instantly prejudice the jury against Mrs. Kimes. That lawyer said the racial makeup of the jury, which includes six blacks and two Hispanics, was a factor in the defense's decision to urge Mrs. Kimes not to testify.</p>
        <p>Some legal experts said Justice Uviller's ruling was unfair to the defense. But others supported it, noting that the judge had barred prosecutors from asking Mrs. Kimes about the other homicide cases.</p>
        <p>''That's a perfectly normal ruling that is consistent with the law,'' said Eddie Hayes, a prominent Manhattan defense lawyer who scoffed at Mrs. Kimes's complaints. He said that ''if she takes the stand, the district attorney will rip her heart out.''</p>
        <p>Final arguments in the trial are expected to begin on Monday.</p>
