        <p>The Nets have received permission from the Los Angeles Lakers to speak with Lakers General Manager Mitch Kupchak about the team's director of basketball operations position, an Eastern Conference executive said. Neither Lewis Katz, the Nets' principal owner, nor Kupchak would comment, nor was it clear whether the parties had already talked about the job.</p>
        <p>Kupchak, in his sixth season as the Lakers' general manager, is one of several candidates the Nets view as a possible head of basketball operations. Others the Nets are known to have an interest in include Lenny Wilkens, John Thompson and Isiah Thomas, though Thomas is thought to have more of an interest in coaching.</p>

        <p>The Nets have received permission from the Los Angeles Lakers to speak with Lakers General Manager Mitch Kupchak about the team's director of basketball operations position, an Eastern Conference executive said. Neither Lewis Katz, the Nets' principal owner, nor Kupchak would comment, nor was it clear whether the parties had already talked about the job.</p>
        <p>Kupchak, in his sixth season as the Lakers' general manager, is one of several candidates the Nets view as a possible head of basketball operations. Others the Nets are known to have an interest in include Lenny Wilkens, John Thompson and Isiah Thomas, though Thomas is thought to have more of an interest in coaching.</p>
        <p>Kupchak, 46, has been a member of the Lakers' front office since retiring after a 10-year playing career in 1986. He signed a long-term contract extension in 1998, but would perhaps consider joining the Nets because of his East Coast background. He was born in Hicksville, N.Y., and starred at Brentwood High School on Long Island before embarking on an all-American career at the University of North Carolina.</p>
        <p>The Nets are hoping to fill their director's position before the National Basketball Association draft on June 28. The director's priorities will be to determine whether to keep John Nash as the general manager and to lead the search for a new head coach.</p>
