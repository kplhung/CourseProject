        <p>The nation's unemployment rate fell below 4 percent in April for the first time in 30 years, the Labor Department announced yesterday, as employers hired, among others, tens of thousands of census takers, restaurant employees and temporary workers in a boom that showed no signs of letting up.</p>
        <p>Indeed, there was little evidence in the employment numbers -- a total of 340,000 new jobs last month and a jobless rate of 3.9 percent -- that the nine-year-old expansion, the longest period of uninterrupted growth in America's history, might be weakening in response to the Federal Reserve's attempt to slow the economy by raising interest rates.</p>

        <p>The nation's unemployment rate fell below 4 percent in April for the first time in 30 years, the Labor Department announced yesterday, as employers hired, among others, tens of thousands of census takers, restaurant employees and temporary workers in a boom that showed no signs of letting up.</p>
        <p>Indeed, there was little evidence in the employment numbers -- a total of 340,000 new jobs last month and a jobless rate of 3.9 percent -- that the nine-year-old expansion, the longest period of uninterrupted growth in America's history, might be weakening in response to the Federal Reserve's attempt to slow the economy by raising interest rates.</p>
        <p>''Everywhere you look, you see the supply of people available for work continuing to shrink pretty rapidly,'' said John Youngdahl, a senior economist at Goldman, Sachs. ''Although there is not much pressure yet on companies to raise prices, the inflation rate has begun to creep up and the Fed must think about where we will be a year from now.''</p>
        <p>The economy may be in its best shape since the 1960's, but the Fed's great fear, often expressed by its chairman, Alan Greenspan, is that job shortages will eventually give workers enough bargaining power to push up labor costs ahead of productivity gains. While wage gains remained relatively modest and many of the latest jobs -- including those created by the Census Bureau -- are temporary, employers may still respond to the tight labor market by raising prices to cover the higher costs -- or simply because the strong economy allows them to.</p>
        <p>Wall Street reacted as if the Fed would be successful in containing any inflationary threat, even if that meant it would have to be more aggressive in raising interest rates. Stock prices shot up, instead of plunging, as they often do in reaction to a strong employment report. The Dow Jones industrial average gained more than 165 points to close at 10,577.86, the Nasdaq rose 2.6 percent and bond yields edged up modestly. [Page C3.]</p>
        <p>Just a week ago, the consensus among analysts and brokers was that the Fed's policy makers would probably raise the short-term interest rates they control by one-quarter of a percentage point, to 6.25, at their May 16 meeting. That would be the sixth such increase since last June. The new consensus apparent in polls taken after yesterday's job numbers were released is for an increase of half a percentage point in rates this month. Wall Street's exuberance seemed to reflect a view that half a percentage point in midmonth should be sufficient to make a dent in the robust economy.</p>
        <p>''God only knows why the markets are doing what they are doing,'' said David Wyss, chief economist at Standard &amp; Poor's DRI. ''All I can figure is that they figure the Fed is going to do a half-point, and that will be it. Get the tightening over, and they can go back to business as usual.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Wyss and other economists noted that a booming stock market complicates the Fed's task by encouraging the all-out consumer spending that has kept the economy booming. ''The stock market certainly did not help the Fed out,'' Mr. Youngdahl said.</p>
        <p>April's employment report was striking for the evidence it offered that the pool of people still available for hire is shrinking. That pool fell by 426,000 men and women, falling below 9.9 million last month, the lowest level since the Labor Department began to track it in 1994. Mr. Greenspan pays particular attention to this statistic because with fewer people available, existing workers, in theory at least, are in a better position to demand and receive strong wage increases.</p>
        <p>With the unemployment rate falling from 4.1 percent to 3.9 percent -- the lowest since January 1970 -- the pool now consists of 5.5 million people labeled as officially unemployed because they are actively looking for jobs, and 4.4 million others who tell Labor Department surveyors that they want to work, but are not currently looking.</p>
        <p>''There is clearly some evidence of accelerating wages and prices,'' said Jared Bernstein, a labor economist at the Economic Policy Institute, noting that labor costs, by several measures, are growing at an annual rate of at least 3.6 percent, and inflation is rising at a similar pace.</p>
        <p>But he wondered whether wages were pushing prices, or the other way around. ''If you track this month to month,'' he said, ''it looks more like tight labor markets are allowing workers to press for wage gains to keep up with prices that reflect the rising cost of oil.''</p>
        <p>Whatever the cause and effect, the average hourly wage of production workers rose 6 cents last month, to $13.64, up 3.6 percent over the last 12 months. That is roughly in line with the gains recorded month after month for more than a year. But broader measures, covering benefits as well as wages, show a recent jump in company payments for health insurance.</p>
        <p>Reflecting the administration's concern that an overly aggressive Fed could damage the economy in an election year, Alexis M. Herman, the secretary of labor, argued that labor productivity was rising quickly enough to offset rising wages. ''In the midst of this debate over interest rates,'' she said, ''we must keep the focus on the nation's strong productivity to absorb any pressure on wages.''</p>
        <p>President Clinton, pointing to the social benefits of a strong economy, called attention to ''the lowest unemployment rate for blacks and Hispanics ever recorded.'' For Hispanics, unemployment dropped to 5.4 percent from 6.3 percent in March, and for blacks the rate edged down to 7.2 percent from 7.3 percent.</p>
        <p>While spread broadly across business and government, job creation was particularly strong at the Census Bureau, which added 73,000 part-time census takers last month on top of the 115,000 added in March. But that hiring should taper off quickly. To count the population, the bureau has hired 500,000 workers this year, and now is up to full strength, a spokesman for the bureau said.</p>
        <p>Over all, the employment gains of 340,000, while strong, were down from an even stronger 458,000 advance in March. But job creation in the private sector remains robust, averaging 222,000 a month since January, up from 198,000 a month last year. Total employment rose to 131.1 million in April.</p>
        <p>Restaurants made the biggest contribution, adding 80,000 jobs, while temporary-help agencies added 46,000 jobs. ''Companies cannot find people, so they turn to the temp agencies, which are luring the elderly back into the work force, kids into part-time work and housewives into work,'' Mr. Wyss said.</p>
        <p>The percentage of the population now holding jobs edged up last month to a record 64.9 percent, from 64.7 percent in March. Only one major industry lost ground: construction jobs fell by 55,000 after having risen by 90,000 the month before.</p>
        <p>Manufacturers also increased their rolls, but by only 11,000 jobs, although the workweek in manufacturing rose by nearly half an hour, and overtime pay also increased.</p>
