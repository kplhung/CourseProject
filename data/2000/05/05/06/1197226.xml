        <p>Vice President Al Gore promised today to spend billions of dollars to recruit new teachers and increase teachers' salaries, but only if the states and teachers' unions agreed that all new teachers meet rigorous national standards and only if hiring decisions are based on expertise, not seniority alone.</p>
        <p>''If I am entrusted with the presidency, I will ensure that there is a fully qualified, well-trained teacher in every single classroom, everywhere in this nation, before the next four years is out,'' Mr. Gore said in a speech here to the Michigan Education Association.</p>

        <p>Vice President Al Gore promised today to spend billions of dollars to recruit new teachers and increase teachers' salaries, but only if the states and teachers' unions agreed that all new teachers meet rigorous national standards and only if hiring decisions are based on expertise, not seniority alone.</p>
        <p>''If I am entrusted with the presidency, I will ensure that there is a fully qualified, well-trained teacher in every single classroom, everywhere in this nation, before the next four years is out,'' Mr. Gore said in a speech here to the Michigan Education Association.</p>
        <p>His proposals are based on the theory that the quality of teachers is the most significant factor within a school's control in improving student achievement.</p>
        <p>Education ranks near the top of voter concerns, especially in important states like Michigan, where Mr. Gore held his fourth ''school day'' today, spending all day at the high school in nearby Holt.</p>
        <p>''In communities where schools, teachers, community groups and local businesses agree on effective plans to raise teacher quality, let's give every qualified teacher a $5,000 raise,'' the vice president said here. ''Let's give $10,000 raises to master teachers.''</p>
        <p>The speech was yet another effort by Mr. Gore to spell out the details of his education plan, which would devote $115 billion to education over 10 years.</p>
        <p>He proposed spending $8 billion in that span to recruit a million new teachers, and another $8 billion to increase teachers' salaries. In addition, he said that by 2004 he would require states to make sure teachers were fully qualified to teach the subjects they were teaching. As of now, he said, only 36 percent of teachers considered themselves to be very well-prepared to meet the standards of their state or school district. In high-poverty areas, as many as 50 percent of the math teachers have not studied math.</p>
        <p>Education is an area to which Mr. Gore's Republican rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, has devoted considerable attention in hopes of wooing swing voters. Polls show Mr. Bush has been successful in this effort. The Gore campaign is countering Mr. Bush's initiatives with proposals that do not just allocate federal money but also make demands of teachers and school districts.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore proposes requiring teachers to have majored in their subject area in college or to pass a competency test. He would reward outstanding teachers and help schools improve or remove bad teachers quickly, within the academic year as opposed to the three years that removal can take now, aides said.</p>
        <p>''While we absolutely must respect due process,'' Mr. Gore said, ''we have to put an end to endless delays in removing those few teachers who really do need to be removed.''</p>
        <p>Principals should be allowed to hire teachers for reasons other than seniority, he said, adding that no teaching contract should be ''a lifetime job guarantee.''</p>
        <p>For years teacher testing and efforts to diminish hiring by seniority have been strongly resisted by teachers' unions. Mr. Gore's aides hoped that his speech today would be seen as a daring, principled stand that would demonstrate that he did not pander to potent supporters like the teachers' unions or just blow with the political winds.</p>
        <p>Amid growing dissatisfaction among parents over the quality of public education, teachers and their unions have recently eased their positions on testing and seniority. Last week the American Federation of Teachers, the nation's second-largest teachers' union, endorsed toughening teacher standards.</p>
        <p>Gregory King, a spokesman for Sandra Feldman, the president of the federation, said Mr. Gore consulted with Ms. Feldman on his proposals. She was heartened, Mr. King said, that Mr. Gore would cede some decisions on teacher hiring to ''principals working with teams of teachers, and not just principals.''</p>
        <p>Mary Elizabeth Teasley, the director of government relations for the nation's largest teachers' union, the National Education Association, said her union was comfortable with Mr. Gore's suggestion that seniority not be the only criterion in teacher hiring. She emphasized, however, that Mr. Gore was not dismissing seniority as a qualification.</p>
        <p>''I believe what he is putting forth is the notion that we should consider credentials and expertise, and that seniority could be a factor, it's just not the only factor,'' Ms. Teasley  said. ''We can work with it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has been trying to demonstrate his commitment to education in multiple ways, including by spending a full day at a school somewhere in the country every week or so. He spent today at Holt High after staying overnight at the home of Margot Strong, a computer teacher, and her husband, Jay, who teaches first grade. Mr. Gore arrived at their house after midnight on Thursday night and stayed up to watch on television four of the five overtime periods in the National Hockey League playoff game between the Philadelphia Flyers and the Pittsburgh Penguins.</p>
        <p>In an interview with the school newspaper, Mr. Gore was asked about abortion. He said he believed it was up to a woman to decide what to do, but he said he also believed in abstinence.</p>
        <p>And he revealed that his glory moment in high school was sinking a long shot at the final buzzer. Asked to list his favorite sports, he said: ''Football, basketball, track, art.''</p>
        <p>Asked what his most difficult moment as vice president had been, he answered without much hesitation,  ''The day our soldiers in Somalia were killed.''</p>
