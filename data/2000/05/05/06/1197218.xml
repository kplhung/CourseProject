        <p>Editorial reports that weather seems more sharply creased than in springs past</p>

        <p>Somehow this spring, the weather seems more sharply creased than it has been in springs past. Instead of gentle transitions -- easing from overcoat to jacket to shirtsleeves -- the temperature swoops and dives like a phoebe feeding on the wing. An installment of April is followed by a parcel of March and then a dose of early December. Spring has managed to be both early and late this year, and still it is only half gone. In a week or two it could be February again in all but name. Or perhaps July.</p>
        <p>This week's season -- genuine May -- makes fair-weather moralists of us all, determined to live out each day in fullness from beginning to end. That is a hard feeling to sustain on the fifth day of cold rain, when the sky is a winter prairie of clouds, and morning and afternoon look much the same. But this past week the days have been episodic. The eastern sky begins to glow, and the clatter and ringing of birdsong begin. Then the scenery is struck, the stage re-dressed, and a new drama, called sunrise, is presented. This is not the wan sun of April, masquerading as March. It is the sun that Wallace Stevens calls ''bull fire.'' And so on throughout the day, hour by hour, each elaborate in its own manner, into the protraction of evening, which is a genre all its own, a cotillion of every living thing, the deer slipping like shadows through the woods, bumblebees working well into dusk, hanging from blossoms like blossoms themselves.</p>

        <p>Somehow this spring, the weather seems more sharply creased than it has been in springs past. Instead of gentle transitions -- easing from overcoat to jacket to shirtsleeves -- the temperature swoops and dives like a phoebe feeding on the wing.

        <p>This week's season -- genuine May -- makes fair-weather moralists of us all, determined to live out each day in fullness from beginning to end. That is a hard feeling to sustain on the fifth day of cold rain, when the sky is a winter prairie of clouds, and morning and afternoon look much the same. But this past week the days have been episodic. The eastern sky begins to glow, and the clatter and ringing of birdsong begin. Then the scenery is struck, the stage re-dressed, and a new drama, called sunrise, is presented. This is not the wan sun of April, masquerading as March. It is the sun that Wallace Stevens calls ''bull fire.'' And so on throughout the day, hour by hour, each elaborate in its own manner, into the protraction of evening, which is a genre all its own, a cotillion of every living thing, the deer slipping like shadows through the woods, bumblebees working well into dusk, hanging from blossoms like blossoms themselves.</p>
        <p>Of course it cannot be sustained, this May-swell and the feeling it arouses in each of us. Attention itself is episodic, coming and going more abruptly even than changes in the weather. Yet that too is what marks the season. There is so much noticing to do these days, so many stages of new growth to witness. When you come to full awareness, penetrated by a sense of the passing instant, you are bound to realize how much time has passed since the last time you mustered that kind of consciousness. Everyday life is the bridge between such moments, when, as Stevens says, ''the moon creeps up to the bubbling of bassoons.''</p>
