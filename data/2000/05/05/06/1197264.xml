        <p>Tim Hardaway had a cocksure step to his gait. It was not quite a strut, but the way the Miami Heat point guard walked off the court today said it all.</p>
        <p>Beware, Patrick Ewing and friends -- I'm back.</p>
        <p>A day after participating in a full-contact scrimmage, Hardaway, a Knick assassin, proclaimed that he was healthy to compete in the Eastern Conference semifinals beginning Sunday at American Airlines Arena.</p>
        <p>''On a 1 to 10, I'm probably a 7 1/2 to 8,'' Hardaway said after practice. ''There is some pain there on certain things that I do, but I can sustain that pain. I feel comfortable with playing with this type of pain.''</p>
        <p>Hardaway said the pain in his left foot that sidelined him for the last four games of the regular season and the three-game sweep of the Detroit Pistons has subsided enough for him to play 30 to 40 minutes in Game 1 of the four-of-seven-game series.</p>
        <p>Asked if Hardaway would start, Coach Pat Riley said: ''I don't know yet. I'm sure he'll probably play on Sunday, but the length will depend on matchups and how the game is going and how he feels.</p>
        <p>''He's looking better every day,'' Riley added. ''Tim's working hard to get back there. And it's an absolute shame he's not at 110 percent because you would get the very best of what everybody wants. But every day he is gaining and looking better.''</p>
        <p>Hardaway's last endearing moment on the court came against the Knicks on April 9 in Miami, when his 3-point shot from the left wing found the bottom of the net in a wild overtime victory. In Game 7 of the 1997 second-round series between the teams, he scored 38 points in a Heat rout. Many of the Knicks expected Hardaway to play on Sunday. As he iced his injured foot after drills all week, his availability was slowly turning into the worst-kept secret in South Florida.</p>
        <p>But the official word brought comfort to many of his teammates and a ratings-conscious league. There was the fear that Hardaway's absence might doom the appeal of another Heat-Knicks series.</p>
        <p>The only question left for Hardaway to answer is how effective he will be, especially if the Knicks play an up-tempo style. ''Our halfcourt offense is exceptional when he's there,'' Riley said. ''Now, if it's going to be a wide-open running game and he's forced to run up and down the court and all that stuff, he's not there yet. I wish he was 100 percent.</p>
        <p>''He'll do anything to help the team win,'' he added, ''whether it's 15 or 30 minutes.''</p>
        <p>Riley also had an off-the-court situation to deal with this week. He sent forward Rodney Buford home after his recent arrest on suspicion of marijuana possession. Riley said he knew about the arrest last Sunday and was working with league officials and players' union officials to figure out a course of action. According to a police report, Buford possessed marijuana when his car was pulled over in Miami last Sunday. Buford had rejoined the team on condition that it did not happen again.</p>
        <p>''We really are handcuffed by the policies of the collective-bargaining agreement as to what we can do, so that's where it's at,'' Riley said. ''I just told Rodney to stay home and let him think about it.''</p>
