        <p>Following is a transcript from a future debate between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Rudolph W. Giuliani:</p>
        <p>Q. Republicans often talk about family values. Mr. Giuliani, would you describe your family's values as nontraditional?</p>
        <p>MR. GIULIANI. My family values privacy very, very much. That's all I'm going to say.</p>
        <p>[Pause]</p>
        <p>Q. Uh, Mrs. Clinton? We're waiting for your rebuttal.</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON. I believe that privacy should be accorded to each and every family in this great state, or any other state, or any statelike entity like the District of Columbia.</p>
        <p>Q. But Mr. Giuliani, you're a public official frequently accompanied in public by a woman you described as a ''very good friend.'' Is it irresponsible for a mayor to engage in such unprecedented behavior?</p>
        <p>MR. GIULIANI. No, but it's very, very irresponsible for you ask that question without checking your historical facts. There is a precedent. In the 1920's, Mayor Jimmy Walker appeared frequently in public with his mistress.</p>
        <p>Q. All right, but Jimmy Walker was a symbol of corruption denounced by your hero, Fiorello La Guardia. Have you changed role models? [Pause] I'll take that sneer as a no. Mrs. Clinton, do you feel it's appropriate for a married public official to have a ''very good friend''?</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON. It depends on what the meaning of ''very'' is. ''Very'' varies. In Mr. Giuliani's case, as you members of the media are well aware from listening to him, one ''very'' signifies little. Note that he did not say ''very, very good friend.''</p>
        <p>MR. GIULIANI. Thank you very, very much, Mrs. Clinton.</p>
        <p>Q. Here's a purely hypothetical question. Suppose a public official living in an executive mansion provided by taxpayers is conducting an extramarital affair. Is a taxpayer justified in saying, 'Look, you can do whatever you want on your own, but as long as you're living under my roof . . . ''?</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON. I think the taxpayers care more about children than roofs. Let's talk about the pressure that are endured by that family in the executive mansion. If those parents can work out some arrangement, any arrangement, to raise their children properly, I say hooray for them. And I will never be silenced about those children.</p>
        <p>MR. GIULIANI. I say amen. If I may quote from Mrs. Clinton, it does indeed take a village to raise a child, and the village isn't filled with just husbands and wives. There are uncles and aunts, and cousins, and friends and neighbors, and second cousins, and very good friends, and very, very good -- well, let me just say it's a very, very, very good book.</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON. Thank you, Mr. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>MR. GIULIANI. Please, Rudy.</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON. Rudy, I just wish we lived in the kind of village where neighbors sympathized with couples who may be undergoing a little strain. They're working long hours, they're under pressure ----</p>
        <p>MR. GIULIANI. Maybe they just need a little space. Or maybe they've grown apart. They have their own careers. They're lonely. One day you look across the breakfast table and think, ''Do I know this person?''</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON. Or maybe you know them too well. You can't stand those puffy, lying eyes ----</p>
        <p>Q. Excuse me, but if I could ask a ----</p>
        <p>MR. GIULIANI. It's nobody's business as long as you get the job done. Do you know what Jimmy Walker's wife said about him? ''He made everyone happy wherever he went.'' She had perspective. She was a very wise and understanding woman. And so you are, Mrs. Clinton.  MRS. CLINTON. Hillary.</p>
        <p>Q. Excuse me! Mr. Giuliani, could you please return to your podium? Perhaps you could each explain why you're willing to endure all these indignities of public office? What do you see as your biggest challenge in the Senate?</p>
        <p>MR. GIULIANI. Living in Washington. It's a long way from New York. If I'm going to do a good job of fighting for New Yorkers, I may have to be away from home for 250 nights a year.</p>
        <p>MRS. CLINTON. I'm steeling myself for 300 nights away from Chappaqua . . . As much as I'll miss my husband ----</p>
        <p>MR. GIULIANI. Sometimes a husband and wife have to sacrifice for the public interest. It could even be 350 nights.</p>
        <p>Q. Why are you smiling at each other?</p>
