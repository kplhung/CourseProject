        <p>The Knicks' Larry Johnson leaned back in his chair in the corner of the SUNY-Purchase practice facility and reflected on his reviled image. He laughed and shrugged, while his eyes danced, perhaps with the devil.</p>
        <p>This is the tango that Johnson clearly embraces, almost as much as the Knicks' impending Hatfield-McCoy reunion with the Miami Heat on Sunday.</p>
        <p>In Miami, the site of Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals, Johnson is both public and private enemy No. 1, vilified by fans and by Miami center Alonzo Mourning alike.</p>
        <p>They do not care for his taunting ''Big L'' bent-elbow gesture, nor have they forgotten his fight with Mourning in Game 4 of the Knick-Heat first-round playoff series two years ago.</p>
        <p>Bring on the Heat. Johnson is more than ready.</p>
        <p>After a week of all work and no play, he is hungry to be the enemy, to hear the boos and use them as more fuel in the explosive series.</p>
        <p>''I thrive on that,'' Johnson said, grinning. ''You got to take everything negative and turn it into a positive. That's always worked for me. But it can't be an act. I'm for these 12, 13 guys and this coaching staff. When we're playing against teams, you don't need to like me.''</p>
        <p>Johnson has used the outlaw image from the time he was a Runnin' Rebel at Nevada-Las Vegas.</p>
        <p>''In Vegas we thrived on being the hated team, on being the bad boys,'' he said. ''That's definitely not my personality. If that helps my team, helps me play better, then so be it.''</p>
        <p>On the way to winning a National Collegiate Athletic Association title, Johnson had rivalries, but nothing as vicious as the one with the Heat.</p>
        <p>''I have fun with this rivalry,'' he said. ''I know that nothing is going to be given to me. It's an all-out brawl. We start the game and say 'good game,' but from then on there, we're slugging it out.''</p>
        <p>Appropriate word choice.</p>
        <p>It has been two seasons and a playoff since the last swinging incident involving Johnson or the two teams.</p>
        <p>In 1998 he and Mourning, a former teammate with the Charlotte Hornets, fought in a regular-season game, just a warm-up for their ugly scene under the basket with 1.4 seconds left in Game 4 of the first-round series.</p>
        <p>Both players received two-game suspensions and fines, with Mourning being assessed $25,000 for throwing the first punch and Johnson $10,000.</p>
        <p>He understands why people formed opinions about him from that fight. ''There is no extra hatred there,'' Johnson said. ''We brought a lot of the extra talk because of our fight and what we've gone through the past times we've played each other.</p>
        <p>''I had to do what I did on the floor, but I really hated it afterward that I had to hear there was a girl involved,'' Johnson said, denying a reported explanation for their rivalry.</p>
        <p>Don Chaney, a Knicks assistant coach, said: ''There's an inner hatred there. I don't know what happened and how it got started, but it's there and I don't think it's ever going to go away.''</p>
        <p>Arriving early as usual, Johnson was unusually chatty in warm-ups. ''He was talking about his shot, he was yelling at the ball,'' Chaney said. ''He's ready to play the game today and he can't wait to get there. When Larry is talking, that's good. That means he's confident.''</p>
        <p>Johnson said he was less angry than he was at the close of the National Basketball Association finals last year. He guarded San Antonio's Tim Duncan with a torn medial collateral ligament in his left knee. ''That was my first time in the finals, and I was banged up,'' Johnson said. ''There was some pressure on me, some added incentive for me to turn things around. I was doing whatever I needed to do.''</p>
        <p>He responded to the pressure by launching an obscene tirade against an N.B.A. official when he objected to a required news media session, and was fined $25,000.</p>
        <p>Days later Johnson referred to his team as ''rebellious slaves,'' trying to portray the Knicks as an undaunted band. He drew wide criticism for both, most notably from the NBC analyst Bill Walton, who called him a disgrace.</p>
        <p>''Bill took it to the extreme, calling people disgraces. Man, you're calling a game, you need to just call a game, you need to point fingers at no one,'' Johnson said.</p>
        <p>Johnson may be attacked, but his teammates adore him for his selfless play. ''He is the best teammate ever,'' Marcus Camby said. ''I wish 'L' were my big brother, he's so genuine and kind. We know he's capable of giving us 20 points. He sacrifices a lot, every year, which goes unnoticed.''</p>
        <p>Chaney said, ''Just when you're counting him out, he steps up big time.''</p>
        <p>Johnson's emotion and his production have carried the Knicks to the second round as his two game-winning 3-pointers in Round 1 against Toronto significantly raised his profile.</p>
        <p>Afterward he formed the ''Big L,'' a sign he started in last year's playoffs, one that opponents, especially in Miami, despise and consider stupid. ''I'm glad they hope they see that stupidness a lot, then,'' Johnson said, grinning.</p>
