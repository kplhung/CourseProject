        <p>Two 16-year-old boys were stabbed yesterday morning in their school cafeteria in Hempstead as other students looked on, police officials said.</p>
        <p>The boys, whose names were not released, were both stabbed in the back at 11:12 a.m. in Hempstead High School. They were in stable condition yesterday at Mercy Medical Center in Rockville Center.</p>
        <p>It was not clear yesterday whether the attacker was also a student. The police said last night that they were interviewing people, but had made no arrests.</p>
        <p>While classes continued at the school of some 1,500 students, psychologists were on hand to provide counseling throughout the day. Some students, interviewed by television reporters at the scene, said that teenagers brought knives to school, and that the metal detectors at the building did not work.</p>
