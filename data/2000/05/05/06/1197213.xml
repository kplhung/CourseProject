      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Challenged by his opponent in the Democratic Senate primary to release his personal tax returns, Jon S. Corzine, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, did what he felt he had to do.</p>
        <p>He called Goldman Sachs and asked for permission.</p>
        <p>But a combination of the firm's refusal to allow him to disclose his financial records and his own contradictory statements is putting Mr. Corzine in an uncomfortable box. And it is giving his opponent, former Gov. Jim Florio, an opportunity to try to turn Mr. Corzine's greatest asset -- the $400 million fortune that is financing his race -- into a liability.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine said that under the terms of his contract with Goldman Sachs, the firm has the ability to limit what he can disclose about the wealth he amassed there. But Mr. Florio is trying to portray Mr. Corzine's limited disclosure as a convenient dodge.</p>
        <p>And in the last three weeks, since Mr.  Florio released his own tax returns and demanded that Mr. Corzine do the same, an intriguing question has arisen: can someone so deeply rooted in the secretive ways of Wall Street disentangle himself enough to satisfy a jealous electorate that he has left his old loyalties behind?</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine, who is bankrolling the most expensive campaign in New Jersey history, said his returns held information that could harm Goldman Sachs competitively if disclosed. Instead, he issued a four-page abstract, approved by the company, of his earnings, deductions and taxes paid over three recent years.</p>
        <p>Supporters and friends of Mr. Corzine say he should not be penalized for trying to strike a balance between the public's right to know and his former firm's right to privacy.</p>
        <p>''He has an obligation and a responsibility to the people at Goldman,'' said Robert E. Rubin, the former Treasury secretary, who also was Mr. Corzine's predecessor as a co-chairman of the firm. Told what information Mr. Corzine had released, Mr. Rubin said it seemed an adequate public disclosure. ''It sounds to me like Jon has found that balance,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But as the Florio campaign derides Mr. Corzine as the would-be ''senator from Goldman Sachs,'' some independent experts on government ethics are beginning to pick up the refrain.</p>
        <p>Charles Lewis, the executive director of the Center for Public Integrity, a nonpartisan watchdog group in Washington, said that Mr. Corzine's refusal or inability to defy his old firm could make voters justifiably question his future independence as an elected official.</p>
        <p>''There is the rather unappealing image of a puppet on a string, of a U.S. senator who is still very, very close, in an unseemly way, to a multibillion-dollar investment bank, with all kinds of scores of business dealings with clients all over the world,'' Mr. Lewis said.</p>
        <p>Disclosure is not a new issue.</p>
        <p>Some candidates simply have refused to release their tax returns, as Frank R. Lautenberg, another millionaire whom Mr. Corzine hopes to succeed, did throughout his 18 years in the Senate. Others have capitulated to political pressure and complied -- as did Senator Robert G. Torricelli in 1996 and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman in 1993, when she defeated Mr. Florio -- calculating that the appearance of something to hide is a greater burden than the loss of privacy.</p>
        <p>But in the bruising primary race between Mr. Florio and Mr. Corzine, nondisclosure, whatever the reason, comes at a stiff price.</p>
        <p>In ''Dear Mr. Corzine'' letters regularly faxed to reporters, Mr. Florio accuses Mr. Corzine of using his old firm's privacy as a convenient dodge. ''Let me remind you that you are currently seeking to represent 8 million New Jersey citizens, not 220 millionaires at Goldman Sachs,'' he wrote in one message.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine said that a confidentiality agreement he signed years ago as a partner at Goldman Sachs remains in effect. While neither he nor officials at the firm would release a copy of the document, Goldman Sachs's filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission include a sample agreement, under which former partners who divulge secrets are subject to damages of as much as $15 million, and the firm's board is the sole judge of what constitutes a violation.</p>
        <p>Still, under mounting pressure from Mr. Florio, Mr. Corzine said he had asked Goldman Sachs to allow him to disclose more information, ranging from the innocuous, like the total number of pages in his tax return, to a list of the forms and schedules in his return, or a redacted copy of his return omitting the most sensitive information. The company said no.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine said the firm's unwillingness to yield should not be read as antagonistic toward him, but as a reflection of legitimate financial concerns and a need to have a consistent policy.</p>
        <p>Beyond Mr. Florio's insinuations, there is no evidence to contradict Mr. Corzine's assertions that his tax returns would show nothing illegal or unethical about his own business activities or those of his former firm. Goldman Sachs, which prepares the personal returns of all its partners, is under continuous audit by the Internal Revenue Service, which maintains an office in the firm's building at 85 Broad Street in Lower Manhattan. Moreover, the firm, for decades one of the most secretive partnerships in America, became a public company a year ago this week, so its financial reports are now laid bare to anyone with Internet access.</p>
        <p>And in any case, Mr. Corzine has certainly paid a greater share of the federal government's bills than most New Jerseyans; his brief financial summaries show he paid $26,232,699 in federal taxes from 1996 to 1998 on adjusted gross earnings of $99,617,597. For 1999, he said, he filed for an extension but paid estimated taxes of $9,938,200 on taxable income of $28,348,500.</p>
        <p>''There are three basic questions here,'' said Steven Goldstein, a co-campaign manager. ''One, has Jon done what the law requires? Yes. Two, has Jon done more than the law requires? Yes. Is Jon being unprecedented in how much he is or isn't disclosing? Absolutely not.''</p>
        <p>Still, if the issue persists in the campaign -- and Mr. Florio shows no sign of letting it die -- Mr. Corzine may have helped to keep it alive by contradicting himself in explaining his actions. In recent news conferences he has told reporters that anything in his tax return could be gleaned from other information already made public: the summaries he has released, the financial disclosure report he filed with the Secretary of the Senate last September, and the thousands of pages of S.E.C. records filed by Goldman Sachs.</p>
        <p>But when asked why, therefore, Goldman Sachs would object to his tax returns being released, Mr. Corzine said they included unspecified but sensitive financial information that was not in any of those other public filings -- information that could compromise the firm.</p>
        <p>Pressed on the point in three interviews, however, Mr. Corzine -- who said he had not reviewed his returns -- pointed out that information that might seem innocuous could be quite damaging. For example, he said that merely the names of partnerships, the earnings or losses they generated, and the taxes they paid to foreign countries could reveal much about Goldman Sachs's operations that was not publicly known. ''For example, if you had big Dutch earnings, people might think you were involved in the oil business in special ways,'' he said, ''because Rotterdam's one of the biggest ports in oil-trading locales in the world.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine said it would not be difficult to glean such information from his returns. ''You wouldn't have to be a forensic accountant,'' he said. ''Not if you were in the business. Not if you're at Morgan Stanley.''</p>
        <p>Seeking to put the issue to rest, Mr. Corzine now says that he will put his assets into a blind trust if he is elected to the Senate. But ethics experts like Mr. Lewis, of the Center for Public Integrity, said that additional measures might be needed to remove the potential for a conflict of interest.</p>
        <p>''There's this vague perception that once you put your assets in a blind trust, not only are you unaware of your own investments, you've had some sort of painless lobotomy so that you don't know what your investments are,'' he said. ''It's very likely that those investments will remain the same for the next six years if he's elected.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Rubin, now an adviser to the chairman of Citigroup, recalled that when he left Goldman Sachs for the White House, in addition to placing his assets in a blind trust -- the executive branch's Office of Government Ethics approved his choice of a trustee -- he purchased a special insurance policy guaranteeing that, should anything happen to his old firm, the value of his own stake in it would be preserved. Because he was not running for office, however, he was not called upon to release his tax returns.</p>
        <p>Ultimately, if Mr. Corzine is elected, it will be up to the Senate Select Committee on Ethics to decide whether he has disclosed enough. William B. Canfield, a Republican lawyer and former counsel to that panel, said that given Mr. Corzine's global financial interests, he should be expected to divulge more information about his financial interests than most other candidates.</p>
        <p>''He has to understand, while he retains some privacy rights, he has given up a substantial number of them in holding himself out for public office,'' Mr. Canfield said. ''Sorry about that. If this stuff were so private, and so closely held by Goldman, maybe he should have thought twice about becoming a candidate.''</p>
