        <p>Iranians voted today in runoff elections for a new Parliament, in an atmosphere of heightened suspense after the conservative crackdown on the politically ascendant reform movement.</p>
        <p>Voting stations were kept open an extra two hours, for a total of 12 hours, to accommodate a high turnout in a number of cities, according to the Interior Ministry.</p>
        <p>There were no runoffs here in the capital, but 66 seats were to be decided in rural areas and a few large cities. Election officials said they expected to announce preliminary results in a few days.</p>
        <p>Reformers backing President Mohammad Khatami hoped to clinch a clear majority in the 290-seat Parliament. Pro-Khatami candidates won an estimated 70 percent of the 185 races that were decided outright in the first round of voting, on Feb. 18.  To secure a seat then, a candidate had to win at least 25 percent of the votes.</p>
        <p>The reformers said they were assured of at least 15 more seats in the second round from races where both candidates were associated with reform parties. But the final count is in the hands of the conservative-dominated Council of Guardians, which must certify elections.</p>
        <p>The council has changed the results in 11 first-round races, in some cases elevating the runner-up to winner and in others voiding the election outright. Reform leaders have said the casualties have all been their allies.</p>
        <p>The runoffs capped several weeks of high drama in Iran, as conservative judges arrested a number of leading reformers and closed 16 reform newspapers and magazines. The national daily newspaper associated with the main reform party, which is headed by President Khatami's brother, was among those closed by the hard-line courts.</p>
        <p>In addition, results from the Tehran vote, in which reformers and independents won 29 of 30 seats, have yet to be certified two months after the first round of voting. The council, which includes some of the most outspoken opponents of the reform movement, has been recounting ballots for more than a month.</p>
        <p>Reform leaders have speculated that the prolonged audit in Tehran is an attempt by conservatives to manipulate the results and reduce the pro-Khatami majority in Parliament, which is scheduled to begin work on May 27.</p>
        <p>But in a highly unusual public explanation of the secretive workings of the Council of Guardians, one of its most prominent members today defended its handling of the Tehran ballots.</p>
        <p>In a sermon before the weekly public prayers at Tehran University, Ayatollah Mohammad Mesbah-Yazdi, one of 12 council members, said the recount in Tehran was not the conservatives' idea, but had been prompted by challenges from two losing candidates and a political party.</p>
        <p>It has taken so long to complete, he said, because election officials did not want to work during the two-week holiday around the Iranian new year in March.</p>
        <p>The first few recounts, he added, showed such large discrepancies between the reported and actual results that the council decided to re-examine votes from a large number of randomly chosen ballot boxes.</p>
        <p>Ayatollah Mesbah-Yazdi has described the reform movement as more dangerous to the system than a military coup because it promotes greater freedom for Iranians to write, read and behave as they wish.</p>
