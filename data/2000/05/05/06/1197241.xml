        <p>Orlando Hernandez wanted a special performance last night, brilliant and orderly, and then afterward he would say a few words about a man who helped reunite him with his children, the late Cardinal John O'Connor. The game unraveled for Hernandez, but after a wild exchange of leads with Baltimore, the Yankees pulled it together in the bottom of the ninth inning with an extra special performance.</p>
        <p>With the Orioles anticipating a bunt, Jorge Posada blasted a three-run homer off B. J. Ryan with nobody out in the bottom of the ninth, propelling the Yankees to a 12-10 victory. Posada raised a fist on his way to first, rounded the bases on a dead sprint and was swallowed by a sea of teammates at home plate, while most of the 42,244 worn out fans stood and cheered at Yankee Stadium.</p>
        <p>''I wouldn't be surprised if the people decided to stay all night and wait for tomorrow's game,'' said Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager.</p>
        <p>This game moved like the Nasdaq: The Yankees blew a 3-0 lead, moved ahead by two runs, fell behind by three, tied the game at 8-8 in the seventh inning, fell behind 10-8 in the eighth, botched a scoring chance in the bottom of the eighth, then finally won in the bottom of the ninth, on Paul O'Neill's solo homer and Posada's three-run shot. Bernie Williams had three hits, including a home run, and four runs batted in.</p>
        <p>Hernandez's outing had long since ended by the time Posada finished the game, and afterward, he spoke quietly. Hernandez plans to take his family to St. Patrick's Cathedral today, where Cardinal O'Connor is lying in rest, after his death Wednesday. He touched Hernandez's life in October of 1998, the fall after Hernandez had defected from Cuba. An emissary of O'Connor carried a letter to the Cuban President Fidel Castro asking that the family that Hernandez left behind be allowed to join him in the United States.</p>
        <p>Castro granted the request and Hernandez's two children -- Yahumara, now 10 years old, and Steffi, 5 -- left Havana with Hernandez's mother and ex-wife. Two days later, Hernandez and his family sat in the front row at St. Patrick's Cathedral, at Mass. O'Connor would baptize his youngest daughter and his fiancee, and Hernandez would be married in February by a priest recommended by O'Connor's office.</p>
        <p>''I really appreciate what he did for me while he was here,'' Hernandez said last night.</p>
        <p>After a moment of silence for O'Connor before last night's game, Hernandez strode to the mound, serious and purposeful. But Hernandez's control failed him.</p>
        <p>Granted a 3-0 lead in the first, Hernandez departed in the fifth, having surrendered seven runs, including three homers; he has allowed 19 runs over 16 2/3  innings in his last three starts. Baltimore moved ahead, 8-5, before Williams lashed a three-run homer in the seventh.</p>
        <p>Delino DeShields slapped a double in the eighth, however, to key a two-run rally for the Orioles, and in the bottom of the eighth, the Yankees' threat ended when Derek Jeter lined into a doubleplay. Jeter, who rarely shows anger, fired his helmet, thinking of what could've been.</p>
        <p>Mike Timlin came on for the Orioles in the bottom of the ninth, needing three outs. But O'Neill, who had bruised his right leg by fouling a ball off it earlier in the game, fouled off several pitches. On the eighth pitch of the at-bat, he drove a home run into the lower deck in right field, his first homer since opening day. It was a shot that gave the whole team a lift, Torre would say later.</p>
        <p>Williams lined a single to right, and Timlin was finished, relieved by Ryan, a left-hander. Martinez fell behind one ball and two strikes, but he checked his swing a couple of times and coaxed a walk from Ryan. First and second, nobody out, the swell of sound rose from the stands.</p>
        <p>The Orioles' infield came together at the mound, to discuss how to defend against Posada in what appeared to be a bunt situation. Rather than wait for the third-base coach Willie Randolph to flash him the sign, Posada walked halfway up the line to meet Randolph.</p>
        <p>''Am I bunting?'' Posada asked.</p>
        <p>Randolph: ''As of now, you're not. Look for a good pitch and drive it up the middle.''</p>
        <p>Cal Ripken, the Orioles' third baseman, had moved in, anticipating the bunt. Ryan looked in for the sign, came set, and then Baltimore infield went in motion: the shortstop Mike Bordick charged for third, Ripken charged in. The wheel play, as it is called, and Randolph's heart leapt -- if Posada could just hit the ball, there was a good chance he could get it through the infield.</p>
        <p>Fastball. Posada, carrying a .389 average, swung hard, and created a distinctive sound. O'Neill was in the clubhouse, getting ice on his leg, and he could hear it over the radio broadcast, that sound. Randolph heard it, ''like a bomb going off.''</p>
        <p>The ball rocketed into the stands in left field, a game-winning home run. Several Orioles stood in place for a few moments, disbelieving, until Posada crossed home plate, where teammates pounded him on the head, knocking off his helmet.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>ROBERTO KELLY's sprained right elbow is not improving, and for the first time, Manager JOE TORRE indicated that Kelly may require surgery. . . . CHUCK KNOBLAUCH was having another needle injected into his left arm Thursday, in the latest attempt to determine if he has something more than a sprained wrist. Doctors didn't change their diagnosis of Knoblauch's injury. Torre mentioned the target date of Monday for Knoblauch's return. . . . The game was interrupted for several minutes with the Orioles batting in the fifth inning when eight people, angered by the arrest of protesters on Vieques Island near Puerto Rico, rushed onto the field waving Puerto Rican flags. Security guards ran out and tackled them and escorted them from the field.</p>
