        <p>The New York State Legislature passed a measure today that will permit the sale and possession of hypodermic needles without a prescription, a move intended to slow the spread of the virus that causes AIDS among addicts who inject drugs.</p>
        <p>The legislation overturns the state's longstanding prohibitions against needle sales, making New York the 43rd state that does not require individuals to obtain prescriptions to buy needles from pharmacists.</p>
        <p>The issue has provoked heated debate in other states, where opponents of over-the-counter needle sales have argued that it would foster drug use. But in New York, no group mounted any organized opposition to the measure, enabling it to move through the Legislature with little public debate or even notice.</p>
        <p>The measure was buried deep within one of the hundreds of spending bills that the Legislature passed shortly after midnight as lawmakers rushed to enact a new state budget and head home for the weekend. Gov. George E. Pataki had submitted the measure to the Legislature, meaning that it does not need his signature to become law.</p>
        <p>The Legislature completed passing the budget late this morning. It calls for spending $77.5 billion, with large spending increases for education, health care and transportation. It also includes nearly $1.5 billion in new tax cuts to be phased in over the next four years. The budget was due April 1. But for the 16th straight year, the governor and the Legislature missed the deadline.</p>
        <p>The nonprescription needle bill had strong support from some of Albany's most influential groups, including physicians, pharmacists and hospitals, as well as organizations representing people with AIDS. The groups argued that the measure would greatly reduce needle-sharing among drug addicts, along with the transmission of H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. In fact, study after study has found that needle-exchange programs help slow the spread of AIDS among drug users and their sex partners.</p>
        <p>The groups immediately praised today's action, though many said that Albany's leaders should have acted years ago because the virus that causes AIDS has spread quickly among intravenous drug users and their partners. Michael Kink, the legislative director for Housing Works, an advocacy group for people with  AIDS, said the law would help stem the spread of the disease.</p>
        <p>He said that AIDS among intravenous drug users fell 50 percent after Connecticut passed a 1992 law permitting pharmacies to sell syringes without a prescription. ''This measure will flat-out save lives in New York,'' Mr. Kink said. ''We have been fighting for this legislation for a decade, and we're happy that New York's leaders have finally recognized how important this law is going to be in the fight against AIDS.''</p>
        <p>Evidence has existed for years that H.I.V. spreads swiftly among addicts who share contaminated needles. More than 50 percent of the new AIDS cases diagnosed each year in New York are found to have been connected to intravenous drug use, according to the New York State AIDS Advisory Council. H.I.V. is spread through semen and blood, and it can be transmitted when an intravenous drug user shares a needle with an infected person.</p>
        <p>''This is the most significant public health legislation in the history of fight against AIDS in New York,'' said Ana Oliveira, executive director of Gay Men's Health Crisis. ''With over 50 percent of new AIDS cases each year attributed to injection drug use as the result of sharing needles, making the sale and possession of needles and syringes legal will go a long way in preventing the transmission of H.I.V. infection.''</p>
        <p>The legislation is similar to the law that Connecticut enacted in 1992.  That state had made it a crime to sell or possess needles and syringes without a prescription. The measure received final legislative approval in New York shortly after midnight, when the Assembly passed it after receiving it from the Senate. Lawmakers in both chambers were skittish about approving the law, fearful that they might be open to criticism that they were encouraging drug use.</p>
        <p>The New York law, which will take effect in January, permits individuals who are 18 or older to buy up to 10 nonprescription needles at a time from a pharmacist. The governor and the Legislature must renew the law in March 2003.</p>
        <p>Richard N. Gottfried, a Democrat who is the main sponsor of the legislation, said he hoped the new law would expand the availability of clean needles. Currently, he said, the price of needles on the black market is so high that addicts feel the need to share them.</p>
        <p>''Needle sharing is the major source of spreading H.I.V. infection in New York,'' said Mr. Gottfried, the chairman of the Health Committee in the State Assembly. ''Drug abusers share needles because our prescription-only law has made it an expensive black-market item. The new law will be an important step forward in our effort to stem the spread in AIDS.''</p>
        <p>For years, New York's leaders have been under pressure to change the state law banning the sale or possession of syringes without a prescription. The law was originally adopted to combat drug abuse. But critics argued that making needles more readily available did not appear to encourage drug use in places like Buffalo, Rochester and New York City, where officials have been running needle-exchange programs with waivers from the state.</p>
