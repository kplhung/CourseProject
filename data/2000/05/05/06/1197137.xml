        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''The Impact of Health Care Reviews'' (editorial, May 1):</p>
        <p>You cite the suggestion of Congressional conferees that only ''published academic articles or other reliable evidence'' be considered by medical review boards when deciding the necessity of a treatment.</p>
        <p>Medicine is only part science. It is art based on science whenever pertinent evidence is available. A scientific study seldom proves that a given doctor's judgment for an individual patient is ''right'' or ''wrong.''</p>
        <p>But there is evidence of a different sort. It's called clinical experience. For example, some doctors prescribed certain oral contraceptives for acne although there was ''no evidence'' until one clever drug company collected the cases to prove it. Clinical experience includes new and prior studies, along with knowledge of people, physiology and pharmacology. It is called the ''art of medicine.''</p>
