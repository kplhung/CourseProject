        <p>George Soros and Julian H. Robertson Jr., money managers who once rattled world financial markets with mere hints of their actions, have lost much of their punch. But hedge funds, the investment vehicles for the wealthy that these prominent investors epitomized, are by no means on the ropes.</p>
        <p>Though comprehensive figures are not available, the unregulated hedge fund industry continues to grow. In 1999, domestic and offshore hedge fund assets grew 23 percent, to $362 billion, according to TASS Research, a Rye, N.Y., firm that advises hedge fund clients. Figures provided by the Hennessee Group, a New York firm that tracks hedge funds and consults with their clients, indicate that the industry grew 47 percent last year, to $324 billion.</p>
        <p>The part of the hedge fund industry known as macro funds, however, has seen its role greatly diminished. These are funds like Long-Term Capital, which was rescued by a group of big financial firms in 1998, and those run by Mr. Soros and Mr. Robertson, which have used complex financial strategies to make large, leveraged bets on the direction of global currency, bond and equity markets.</p>
        <p>At the end of 1996, macro funds accounted for roughly 30 percent of all hedge fund assets, making them by far the largest single category, according to a Hennessee Group report. By the end of last year, they had dwindled to about 7.2 percent of hedge fund assets. Because of the recent demise of Mr. Robertson's Tiger Management and the turmoil of the family of funds at Soros Fund Management, the portion in macro funds will probably be even smaller at the end of this year.</p>
        <p>The macro funds have been eclipsed by a core of smaller, more nimble funds that focus on specific sectors, or by larger firms that offer collections of smaller funds.</p>
        <p>''This is the next wave,'' said Philip W. Treick, who managed two mutual funds for the insurer Transamerica to top performances in 1998 before leaving to help start his own hedge fund group last year. ''It is becoming absolutely apparent that big is not good in hedge funds.''</p>
        <p>The new managers are more likely to be stock pickers than superstar macro managers. ''There is a change in the industry,'' said Andrew J. Kessler, co-founder of the $500 million Silicon Valley hedge fund Velocity Partners, begun in 1996. ''We don't do macro bets. I don't even know how to do that.''</p>
        <p>Pequot Capital, a secretive investment management firm in Westport, Conn., that oversees $10 billion to $12 billion in more than 18 funds, avoids macro strategies and is widely considered the largest hedge fund manager after the Soros group, which has shrunk considerably.</p>
        <p>Mr. Soros said this week that he thought investors might withdraw as much as $3 billion from his $14.2 billion hedge fund empire. After incurring significant losses this year, Mr. Soros's top two lieutenants announced a week ago that they were departing Soros Fund Management. Their exit came just three weeks after Mr. Robertson said he was dismantling Tiger Management.</p>
        <p>In 1998, Mr. Soros and Mr. Robertson presided over assets of more than $20 billion each, and their sway over markets was amplified by their use of leverage and their reputations. Mr. Soros was called ''the man who broke the pound'' after making a $10 billion bet against the British pound in 1992 that brought him a profit of at least $1 billion.</p>
        <p>Despite impressive long-term records, Mr. Soros and Mr. Robertson could not keep up the pace the last two years. Besides failed bets on the direction of prices for currencies like the euro, both were hurt by technology stocks and their transforming effects on the markets, though in different ways. Mr. Robertson missed out largely because he avoided technology stocks. Stanley F. Druckenmiller, who managed Mr. Soros' flagship $8.2 billion Quantum Fund, made a significant move into technology stocks in the middle of last year. But his technology exposure during the market woes last month led to a 22 percent decline in the fund's performance this year, he said last week.</p>
        <p>The losses led Mr. Soros, in a letter to shareholders, to say that ''a large hedge fund like Quantum Fund is no longer the best way to manage money.'' He plans to remodel Quantum as a more conservative fund called Quantum Endowment.</p>
        <p>Hedge fund clients now prefer funds that use less leverage, or borrowed money, than Mr. Soros was known for, according to B. Scott Reid, who oversees four hedge funds for the Auda Group, a New York firm that manages $1.4 billion.</p>
        <p>''They want risk controls, reduced leverage and more transparency,'' Mr. Reid said. ''They don't simply want to know if they're making money or losing it; they want to know how it's made.''</p>
        <p>Valuation models at the big firms are also being questioned. Increasing volatility in the markets, and the wide-eyed enthusiasm for the next new thing, has made traditional valuation methods less profitable of late. As the kick-the-tires investor Warren E. Buffett notably said after a disappointing 1998, he would have done better if he had gone to the movies instead of to the office.</p>
        <p>''Fundamental analysis says value stocks should be bought and tech stocks sold, but that's not what was happening,'' said Charles J. Gradante, chief investment strategist at the Hennessee Group. He said he believed that certain macro strategies continue to succeed but that the rules of the game have changed.</p>
        <p>''The people who were reading the tape -- in terms of currency trends, bond market trends and stock market trends -- were making money,'' he said. ''The people that were reading balance sheets and income statements were losing money.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Robertson does not expect fundamental analysis to be forever out of fashion. ''The market goes through these periods of irrationality, where the worst stocks do best,'' he said last week. ''We've been in a period of irrationality for such a long time that it hurts a rational strategy. You have a group of irrational investors carrying the market.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Soros was describing his difficulties last week, Mr. Robertson was preparing to take his family snorkeling at the Great Barrier Reef in Australia.</p>
        <p>''There are a lot of great young people coming along,'' he said. ''It's their time to be in the sun.''</p>
