        <p>There are very few differences, ritually speaking, between a funeral for a cardinal and one for any other Catholic. One is that a cardinal, like other priests, lies in state in his church before burial.

        <p>There are very few differences, ritually speaking, between a funeral for a cardinal and one for any other Catholic. One is that a cardinal, like other priests, lies in state in his church before burial. In this case, of course, the cardinal is John O'Connor, who died at 80 on Wednesday night, and the church is St. Patrick's Cathedral, the largest Roman Catholic cathedral in the United States.</p>
        <p>As mourners pay their respects to Cardinal O'Connor this weekend, they will see him dressed in the same vestments he would use when celebrating a Mass on Easter or Christmas, with the white bishop's miter that is reserved for the holiest days. On his wedding finger, there is a ring that symbolizes devotion to his flock.</p>
        <p>Before he is placed in the crypt underneath the high altar, a final commendation will be spoken, most likely by one of the three cardinals who will preside over the funeral Mass. After another rite, the Prayer of Entombment, the cardinal's family and the clergymen will file out of the crypt, and the cardinal will be entombed in private, said the Rev. Eric Raaser, dean of students at the St. John Neumann Seminary Residence. There the cardinal will rest, unless there is a motion to canonize him and his coffin is disinterred to check whether, by chance or miracle, his body has remained ''incorruptible.''</p>
        <p>As the funeral weekend progresses, there are hundreds of details to be taken care of. But the liturgical ones are almost rote, compared with the logistical ones.</p>
        <p>Some matters were far from the spiritual. And many of them were attended to by Joseph Zwilling, the  press spokesman who had played straight man to the quip-loving cardinal for 16 years. No, he did not remember saying NY1 could set up a camera stand on the steps of the cathedral, Mr. Zwilling almost sighed into a walkie-talkie after a news briefing yesterday, a few hours before the cardinal's body was due to arrive there.</p>
        <p>''We want this to be as dignified as possible,'' he said patiently. ''If it's what I'm picturing in my mind, I probably wouldn't have agreed to it.'' Then, almost in the same breath, he agreed to the camera stand if someone at the cathedral said it looked acceptable. A television journalist rushed in, late, and asked him how he was.</p>
        <p>''About to fall over,'' Mr. Zwilling said.</p>
        <p>For the funeral Mass, more than 3,500 tickets will be issued for a cathedral that seats 2,300. President and Mrs. Clinton will attend, Secret Service in tow. Vice President Al Gore, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, Gov. George E. Pataki and Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani plan to come, as well. During the Mass at 2 p.m. Monday, the streets around St. Patrick's will be closed to traffic.</p>
        <p>In preparation, the Catholic Center on First Avenue has suspended all its normal operations. An ad hoc office was created to help with hospitality arrangements. A command center was set up to handle calls. The director of human resources, Deacon Randy Velez, spent yesterday manning one of six urgently ringing phones, talking to everyone from a new convert in Denver who wanted to express his condolences, to the Archbishop of Northern Ireland calling about his trip.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, the Archdiocese faxed forms to every bishop asking for their R.S.V.P.'s and travel requirements. All eight United States cardinals will be at the funeral, along with the Vatican's secretary of state, Cardinal Angelo Sodano, who will preside over the Mass. ''Every bishop I can think of will be attending,'' Deacon Velez said.</p>
        <p>Before the Mass, the priests will gather at the Palace Hotel, across the street from the cathedral buildings, to put on their robes for the procession of concelebrants, or clergy. The bishops will dress downstairs at the cathedral, and exit through the side door to join the procession, which will be arranged by rank.</p>
        <p>There will be no altar boys; instead the altar will be manned, as it is every third Sunday, by seminarians from St. Joseph's Seminary of Dunwoodie, N.Y. The Rev. Tom Lynch, the seminary's master of ceremonies, said that all 40 seminarians would be on hand to help the concelebrants, but only eight would serve at the altar. There was not much debate  over which eight would have the honor.</p>
        <p>''Frankly, I just look at who's better at pushing priests around, and doing it nicely,'' Father Lynch said.</p>
        <p>While Cardinal Sodano will preside over the Mass, two men who were at the cardinal's deathbed will, according to his request, take part. Cardinal Bernard Law, archbishop of Boston, will deliver the homily, and Cardinal William Wakefield Baum, a Vatican official, will give an address.</p>
        <p>It is not unusual for such requests to be made, even when they break with the tradition of bishops preaching at bishops' funerals. At the funeral for Cardinal Joseph Bernardin, archbishop of Chicago, in 1996, a monsignor who had long been his secretary gave the homily.</p>
        <p>At St. Patrick's, multiple Masses will be held all weekend for groups of special concern to Cardinal O'Connor, including children and the disabled. Those Masses are all open to the public.</p>
        <p>''What was really our overriding concern was that as many people be given an opportunity to pay their respects,'' Mr. Zwilling said.</p>
