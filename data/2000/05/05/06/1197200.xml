        <p>A Maryland judge ruled today that the state could go ahead with its prosecution of Linda R. Tripp on charges that she broke the law when she secretly tape-recorded conversations with Monica S. Lewinsky about Ms. Lewinsky's relationship with President Clinton.</p>
        <p>But the judge, Diane O. Leasure of Howard County Circuit Court, also dealt a severe blow to the case by suppressing the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky and another witness that may be crucial in obtaining a conviction.</p>
        <p>Judge Leasure ruled that the testimony of Ms. Lewinsky on one critical point was not credible. The judge dismissed as implausible Ms. Lewinsky's statements to the court in December about why she was certain that a specific conversation secretly tape-recorded by Mrs. Tripp had occurred on Dec. 22, 1997.</p>
        <p>The date of the conversation is pivotal because the Maryland law under which Mrs. Tripp is charged specifies that a person is guilty only if it can be shown that she knew at the time of the taping that it was illegal.</p>
        <p>Although Mrs. Tripp recorded more than 20 hours of her telephone conversations with Ms. Lewinsky, the one that occurred on Dec. 22 was the only one that took place after prosecutors believe Mrs. Tripp was definitively informed by her lawyer that it was illegal to tape phone conversations in Maryland without the consent of the other party.</p>
        <p>''The fact that Ms. Lewinsky has admitted that she lied under oath in a federal proceeding and has stated that lying has been a part of her life does not enhance her credibility as a witness,'' Judge Leasure wrote in her 41-page opinion.</p>
        <p>In addition, Judge Leasure ruled that prosecutors could not use the testimony of another witness, Mary Catherine Friedrich, the only other person who might have been able to identify the time period in which Mrs. Tripp secretly tape-recorded her conversations with Ms. Lewinsky.</p>
        <p>The chief state prosecutor in the case, Stephen F. Montanarelli, acknowledged in an interview that while the ruling allowed him to go forward, ''We now have a very serious problem.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Montanarelli said he would review the ruling and make a decision whether to pursue the prosecution without the testimony that Judge Leasure barred in her ruling today. He said he would decide before the scheduled trial date of July 10.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Tripp said today that she believed a decision by Mr. Montanarelli to go forward after today's ruling would be especially vindictive and malicious.</p>
        <p>''The decision to indict me was politically motivated and wrong,'' she said in a statement. ''This case is being prosecuted solely because I blew the whistle on President Clinton's attempt to fix a court case.''</p>
        <p>She was referring to Paula Corbin Jones's sexual misconduct lawsuit in which Mr. Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky both denied having had a sexual relationship.</p>
        <p>The issue decided today involved whether the Maryland prosecutors could demonstrate that their evidence against Mrs. Tripp was developed independently of and did not rely on the work of Kenneth W. Starr, the independent counsel who investigated Mr. Clinton on Whitewater and other matters.</p>
        <p>That is because when Mrs. Tripp became an informer for Mr. Starr, telling him of the president's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky, she was given a grant of immunity. Although Judge Leasure sharply limited the scope of the immunity agreement earlier, prosecutors still had to demonstrate that their witnesses and evidence were not derived from or tainted by knowledge of Mr. Starr's findings.</p>
        <p>In the Dec. 22 conversation, Mrs. Tripp and Ms. Lewinsky discussed the subpoenas they had just received in the Paula Jones lawsuit. Ms. Lewinsky talked about whether she could lie for Mr. Clinton, and they discussed gifts he had given her.</p>
        <p>Ms. Lewinsky testified that she did not rely on her association with Mr. Starr's investigators to identify the tape recording as having occurred on Dec. 22, 1997, as the investigators had concluded. She said she recognized the conversation as having occurred a few days before Christmas of that year because it coincided with other memorable events.</p>
        <p>But Judge Leasure said there was no question that Ms. Lewinsky had been exposed greatly to Mr. Starr's investigation, even seeing testimony as to the date of the conversation.</p>
        <p>''The defense argues that Ms. Lewinsky is 'bathed in impermissible taint,' '' Judge Leasure wrote. ''The court agrees.''</p>
        <p>Joseph Murtha, Mrs. Tripp's lawyer, said that while he had hoped Judge Leasure would have dismissed the case, he believed her ruling ''significantly hobbled the state's ability to prosecute.''</p>
        <p>Judge Leasure ruled that prosecutors could not use Ms. Friedrich's testimony because they only learned of her through the Starr investigation. Ms. Friedrich said Mrs. Tripp played some of the tapes for her and she knew that one occurred around Christmastime because it had Mrs. Tripp yelling at her daughter for knocking down the Christmas tree.</p>
        <p>If Mr. Montanarelli decides to go forward, Judge Leasure ruled, Ms. Lewinsky's testimony will be limited to her assertions that she never gave consent to have her conversations with Mrs. Tripp recorded.</p>
        <p>The ruling appears to leave the prosecutors with only the testimony of some of Mrs. Tripp's partners in a weekly bridge game and a neighbor, all of whom seemed aware that she was secretly taping conversations with a woman named ''Monica'' who was having an intimate relationship with Mr. Clinton.</p>
        <p>The women testified that Mrs. Tripp sometimes boasted of secretly taping the other woman and even invited Ms. Lewinsky to a Christmas party at her Columbia, Md., home so the others could gaze upon the woman she had told them about.</p>
        <p>Judge Leasure ruled today that the testimony of those women could be used by the prosecution. But none of them seemed able to recollect exactly when they learned of the taping, and none are able to identify the date of the crucial Dec. 22, 1997, conversation.</p>
