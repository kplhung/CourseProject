        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>James C. Dobson (''The Casino Corrupts the Arena,'' Op-Ed, May 5) misses the mark entirely. The problem with college sports stems not from casino gambling, but from the fact that most colleges and universities have decided to abandon true academic pursuits and instead have become little more than trade schools that also field semiprofessional athletic teams.</p>
        <p>How else do you explain that grown men will spend hours glued to a television watching teenagers playing for a college the men have never attended or even visited, and are willing to bet thousands of dollars on the outcome?</p>
