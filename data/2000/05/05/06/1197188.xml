        <p>Four drug companies have agreed to plead guilty to taking part in an international conspiracy to fix vitamin prices, and two former executives agreed to prison terms, Justice Department officials said today.</p>
        <p>In addition, the companies -- Nepera Inc. of Harriman, N.Y.; Reilly Industries of Indianapolis; and Merck KgaA and Degussa-Huls of Germany -- agreed to pay a total of $33 million in fines, the officials said.</p>
        <p>The four companies are the latest to plead guilty in the Justice Department's long-running investigation of the worldwide vitamin industry, whose leaders colluded for more than a decade to increase the prices of bulk vitamins used in everything from breakfast cereal to animal feed, officials said.</p>
        <p>Joel I. Klein, the assistant attorney general responsible for antitrust prosecutions, has called the price-fixing operation -- which has snared some of the world's best-known drug companies -- ''the most pervasive and harmful criminal antitrust conspiracy ever uncovered.''</p>
        <p>The conspiracy, which officials traced to executives at Roche of Switzerland and BASF of Germany, began in 1989 and grew to include French and Japanese drug concerns. Because those companies have operations in the United States, they were subject to prosecution in this country.</p>
        <p>Over all, seven companies have agreed to pay nearly $2 billion in government and class-action settlements for fixing the prices of vitamins in the United States.</p>
        <p>Justice Department officials accused the four companies named today of sharing sales and customer information, fixing prices and carving up the market for common products like Vitamin C, niacin and Vitamin B3.</p>
        <p>Merck KgaA, which is based in Darmstadt, Germany, and is unrelated to the United States pharmaceutical company of the same name, has agreed to pay a $14 million criminal fine for taking part in a Vitamin C cartel between 1991 and 1995, officials said.</p>
        <p>Degussa-Huls of Frankfurt acknowledged setting prices of Vitamin B3 for three years ending in 1995 and accepted a $13 million fine.</p>
        <p>Nepera, a unit of the Cambrex Corporation, agreed to a $4 million criminal fine for fixing prices of Vitamin B3 and niacin. Roger Noack, the former president of Nepera, agreed to serve eight months in prison and pay a $50,000 fine. David Purpi, a former vice president of Nepera, agreed to serve one year and a day in prison and pay a $100,000 fine, officials said.</p>
        <p>Reilly Industries accepted a $2 million fine for taking part in the Vitamin B3 conspiracy.</p>
        <p>The companies divided up lucrative markets around the world and held regular budget meetings to prevent cheating, officials said.</p>
