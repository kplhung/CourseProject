        <p>IF you love horses, the smells, the sights and the sounds never get old; if you love the Kentucky Derby, the pre-race excitement never loses its electricity. At 6 a.m. yesterday, the darkness at Churchill Downs was defined by shadows, with grooms, trainers and riders moving in a haphazard choreography of chores in the refreshing chill of spring air. Through the muddy maze of walkways and stables, Wayne Kotcamp led the way.</p>
        <p>He was taking part in a Derby ritual, the first hours of the Kentucky Oaks Day races, the elaborate prelude to the Kentucky Derby. As such, Kotcamp was one of hundreds of thousands of characters in the Derby drama. This morning, he and his wife, Eileen, will meet with friends by 10 and have brunch by 10:30. Then they'll proceed to Churchill Downs and watch the first Kentucky Derby of the millennium. Kotcamp is an orthopedic surgeon by training, the owner of a horse by choice. But not a high-stakes owner. On the drive over to the track yesterday, he talked about the high cost of maintaining a horse and wisely advised: ''You can't own racehorses and have children.''</p>

        <p>IF you love horses, the smells, the sights and the sounds never get old; if you love the Kentucky Derby, the pre-race excitement never loses its electricity. At 6 a.m. yesterday, the darkness at Churchill Downs was defined by shadows, with grooms, trainers and riders moving in a haphazard choreography of chores in the refreshing chill of spring air. Through the muddy maze of walkways and stables, Wayne Kotcamp led the way.</p>
        <p>He was taking part in a Derby ritual, the first hours of the Kentucky Oaks Day races, the elaborate prelude to the Kentucky Derby. As such, Kotcamp was one of hundreds of thousands of characters in the Derby drama. This morning, he and his wife, Eileen, will meet with friends by 10 and have brunch by 10:30. Then they'll proceed to Churchill Downs and watch the first Kentucky Derby of the millennium. Kotcamp is an orthopedic surgeon by training, the owner of a horse by choice. But not a high-stakes owner. On the drive over to the track yesterday, he talked about the high cost of maintaining a horse and wisely advised: ''You can't own racehorses and have children.''</p>
        <p>I reminded him that he raised four children.  ''I was an orthopedic surgeon,'' he said, by way of explaining how he defied his own advice. ''A hard-working orthopedic surgeon.''</p>
        <p>There are two main attractions in Louisville -- the Ohio River and the horses. For Kotcamp, who was born in Greenup, Ky., in 1928, the track has been an emotional outlet much more than a succession of financial windfalls. As such, the pursuit of the ultimate horse is really background music for relationships forged over the years.</p>
        <p>The first person to greet Kotcamp yesterday was Robbie O'Connor, who trains Kotcamp's horse, Divet. Kotcamp is not O'Connor's primary client, but their relationship has deep roots. Kotcamp owned horses with O'Connor's father, a psychiatrist, and has known the son since he was a teenager. O'Connor said that the track was his second home growing up.</p>
        <p>''I went to the track a lot with my dad,'' he said. ''That was our quality time. They had an old place, an old track that raced at night. We'd go out there in the evening and watch races. So I got kind of smitten by the bug.''</p>
        <p>After two years of college, O'Connor dropped out of school to make the track his life. He emptied his bank account, bet $1,600 on a horse that his mentor, the trainer Billy Ashenbrener, felt had potential. ''I got back $16,000,'' O'Connor said. ''I didn't want to be a doctor anymore; I thought I'd be a horse trainer.''</p>
        <p>O'Connor said that once he left school and became an assistant to Ashenbrener, his parents put him out of the house. O'Connor's father owned horses but wouldn't give any to his son to train. Kotcamp came to the rescue.</p>
        <p>''I called his dad, asked if it was O.K. to give him one of my horses,'' Kotcamp said. ''He said it was O.K., and that's how we started.'' O'Connor smiled. ''When I started doing well, picking up clients, my dad gave me horses,'' he said. ''The rest of it's history.''</p>
        <p>A few yards away, Kotcamp spotted Angel Montano and went over to greet him. Montano is a trainer who arrived at Churchill Downs by way of Mexico in 1956, when he was still a jockey. The track helped put five children through college and provided Montano and his family with a comfortable life. He celebrates each Derby with a feast at the track. This year, he has prepared 250 chickens, crawfish from New Orleans, barbecue ribs from Evansville.</p>
        <p>''They're going to have to haul me off the racetrack,'' he said. ''I won't retire.''</p>
        <p>At 11 a.m., Kotcamp and I left the insular world of Derby racing and headed for Memorial Park, about 10 minutes south of Churchill Downs. The Rev. Al Sharpton, Dick Gregory and Martin Luther King III had scheduled an Oaks Day rally to highlight accusations by local African-American groups that the Louisville police and other local government bodies have racist hiring policies. They intentionally chose Derby week for the protest. Gregory stood in the hot sun, his face covered with a horse mask. ''I had to take a walk this morning, someone suggested I'd be safe wearing this,'' Gregory said. ''The police won't shoot a horse.''</p>
        <p>Sharpton said if the situation didn't improve, next year might bring a race of a different color. ''There'll be more than horses on the track,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Kotcamp, asked if he thought Louisville was being treated too harshly, said of the protesters: ''Maybe they need to be harsh.''</p>
        <p>The lunchtime rally was nearly over when we headed back to Churchill Downs, leaving the frustration and anger of one world for the bubbly anticipation of another.</p>
