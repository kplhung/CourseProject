        <p>Henry Flagler came to Florida in 1883 to build grand hotels in what was sparsely populated coastal scrub. Using wealth amassed as one of the Standard Oil Company's founders, he began cobbling together a railroad down the length of the state. He opened up Florida as he went, erecting posh resorts like the Palm Beach Inn, later called the Breakers, that would serve as starting points for future cities. By 1896, he had built 350 miles of track from Jacksonville to Miami.</p>
        <p>Now Florida East Coast Industries, the holding company controlling the Flagler railroad, is using the right of way to establish itself in the new economy. Since last May, the company's subsidiary, Epik Communications, has been selling capacity to move digital information through fiber optic cables that run alongside chugging train cars piled high with crushed stone, building materials and vehicles.</p>
        <p>Like most railroads, Florida East Coast Railroad had been collecting rent from giant telecommunications companies that had buried cable beside its tracks. But two years ago the company decided to jump directly into the market for bandwidth capacity. Just shy of one year into its venture selling transmission capacity to telephone companies, wireless services and Internet service providers, Epik's network covers 80 percent of Florida's population and extends west to Texas and north to Atlanta. The revenue backlog is $60 million.</p>
        <p>''What makes it a great railroad franchise is what makes it a terrific telecom franchise,'' says Robert Anestis, the chairman, president and chief operating officer of Florida East Coast Industries, who came on board in January 1999 to exploit the telecommunications potential. ''We're in the center of growth.''</p>
        <p>The story of how the little railroad leveraged the dirt along its tracks to leap into fiber optic communications provides a glimpse into some of the swaps and barters used to create a glass network for the streams of digital bits and bytes cycling around the globe. It also suggests how some old-economy transportation and power companies may find prosperity in a cyberage.</p>
        <p>Railroad tracks make good paths for telecommunications cable because they offer cleared, linear routes. In fact, special railroad cars run along tracks plowing cable underground as they move. The cost of assembling such paths for conduits from scratch would be astronomical.</p>
        <p>In the same way, energy and utility rights of way are used for fiber optics. For instance, the Williams Companies created a whole new venture by putting cables along its natural gas pipelines. Consolidated Edison's infrastructure is being used for fiber optic lines into 2,000 buildings in New York.</p>
        <p>Southern Pacific Railroad is the textbook example of a railroad creating telecommunications companies, having spawned both Sprint and Qwest Communications International.</p>
        <p>In this latest sweep of new entries along with FLorida East Coast are the Norfolk Southern Corporation and the CSX Corporation. ''The pickings have been so good, a lot of people have been getting into this industry,'' says Tim Caffrey, who follows telecommunications for Standard &amp; Poor's.</p>
        <p>While Florida East Coast is small, it is beginning to attract attention. Since January 1999, its stock has gone from $27 a share to over $46; its market capitalization has risen from $800 million to just under $1.8 billion. In mid-April an investment group including the Texas billionaire Robert Bass acquired a 5 percent stake in the holding company, based in St. Augustine, Fla., with its railroad, trucking, real estate and now telecommunications businesses.</p>
        <p>''It's in the nascent stages, but the company is beginning to make a major play in the telecom industry,'' says Andrew Hamerling, an analyst at BancAmerica Securities.</p>
        <p>Florida East Coast was a fairly inert company until Mr. Anestis began to kick-start the assets that Mr. Flagler had put into place 100 years earlier. The company and the St. Joe Company, which held a 54 percent stake in Florida East Coast until recently, had lagged under the control of the conservative Alfred I. duPont Testamentary Trust.</p>
        <p>But in the early 1990's, investors pressed St. Joe to start exploiting its assets for better shareholder returns. It shed operations like a paper mill, telephone company and bank to focus on its one million acres of real estate in the Florida Panhandle for resort development.</p>
        <p>When St. Joe took a look at its 53.8 percent stake, it decided that it should put the company up for sale. But Mr. Anestis, then a consultant to Peter S. Rummel, St. Joe's chairman, convinced him that there was better way to capture the value of the telecommunications potential.</p>
        <p>''I told him it's much better to jump into this thing proactively,'' Mr. Anestis recalls.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anestis had had an eye on the company's telecommunications rights of way for some time. In the early 1980's AT&amp;T, MCI, WorldCom and other big players installed fiber optic cables along Florida East Coast Railroad lines to reach the state's growing cities. These leases were a no-cost stream of passive revenue. The next big cable construction wave followed the 1996 telecommunications act. During this second buildup, Florida East Coast decided to get a piece of the digital action.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anestis started as a mergers and acquisitions lawyer in Pittsburgh, then headed a railroad holding company, Guilford Transportation Industries, that a client had created. In 1984, AT&amp;T leased right of way from Guilford on an unused line in the White Mountains to add capacity to its Boston-to-Montreal fiber link. The old line, with small trees growing in the tracks, showed Mr. Anestis how valuable such linear paths could be. Mr. Anestis left Guilford and started an investment advisory firm, still consulting with railroads and negotiating right of way leases with telecommunications companies.</p>
        <p>In 1997, when Qwest wanted to bury cable on Florida East Coast Railroad routes, Mr. Anestis negotiated on behalf of the railroad and got Qwest to build three conduits for Florida East Coast as part of the bargain.</p>
        <p>The next year when Williams was anxious to add Florida capacity along the railroad's right of way, Mr. Anestis brokered a deal for 36 strands of dark fiber from Williams. Dark fiber is unactivated cable.</p>
        <p>Instead of being just a passive landlord, Florida East Coast now had telecommunication assets, but it did not know how to deploy them. ''We were pretty good horse traders, but we really didn't know what to do with this,'' Mr. Anestis said. Soon after these deals, he was made head of Florida East Coast Industries.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anestis hired strategic consultants at the Cambridge-based Monitor Company to determine whether 3 empty conduits and 36 strands were enough to jump-start a new telecommunications company. Each 1.25-inch conduit can hold 216 fiber optic strands. Two strands of activated cable can transmit 129,000 simultaneous telephone calls. New technology is expected to increase that number a hundredfold.</p>
        <p>John McClellan, Monitor's head of telecommunications, concluded that the venture could work. Florida's economy was expected to grow 37 percent faster than the rest of the country over the next 10 years. The company's rights of way, conduits and fiber amounted to a base to reach the majority of the state's population.</p>
        <p>Florida East Coast also had enough capital to invest nearly $100 million in cash to get the initial parts of the business up and running.</p>
        <p>At the end of the consultation, Mr. McClellan decided to leave his 16-year career at Monitor to head the new Florida East Coast venture.</p>
        <p>Now, Mr. McClellan splits his time between his home in Groton, Mass., and Epik's headquarters in Orlando. He took a two-thirds pay cut, spurred by the prospect of stock options. Mr. Anestis said Epik could go public in as few as six months, but acknowledged that market volatility could extend that timetable.</p>
        <p>''I entered into this knowing we're in this a while trying to build a business,'' Mr. McClellan said.</p>
        <p>Under Mr. McClellan, Epik has extended its reach beyond Florida in fiber and conduit swaps with Enron Broadband Services and Broadwing Communications.</p>
        <p>''We're becoming experts in swaps and barter,'' Mr. Anestis said. Trade-outs allow quick geographic links without time-consuming installation. Fiber optic companies build excess capacity so they can use it as capital in future trades.</p>
        <p>Florida East Coast and Epik officials, meanwhile, are huddling over aerial photos of the 18,000 Florida acres that Mr. Flagler accumulated and that remain under company control.</p>
        <p>Gran Central, a real estate subsidiary, has built a portfolio of high-end office complexes and industrial buildings. Now, the company is considering the land for Telecom Hotels, high-rises intended to house equipment needed to keep data flowing smoothly. The company is also considering constructing office buildings prewired for the latest technology.</p>
        <p>Many railroad industry executives are looking for new opportunities. Last year, Norfolk Southern created a subsidiary, Thoroughbred Technology and Telecommunications, or T-Cubed. The railroad plans to lay conduit and use its microwave towers to sell bandwidth capacity to carriers.</p>
        <p>In March, CSX signed an agreement with Pathnet Inc., a wholesaler of bandwidth based in Reston, Va., to provide railroad right of way in exchange for equity in Pathnet. Burlington Northern Santa Fe and Colonial Pipeline also signed ''right of way for equity'' deals with Pathnet.</p>
        <p>With all these new players, Mr. Caffrey at Standard &amp; Poor's and other industry watchers say a glut of fiber capacity may be on the horizon. Mr. Anestis is not flustered by the prospect. ''We assumed that this supply would cause prices to fall,'' he said. ''Even so, with the slope of growth there's a great business here.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 13, 2000, Saturday  Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day on May 6 about the move of Florida East Coast Industries into the telecommunications business misstated the company's ownership. While the St. Joe Company, which holds nearly 54 percent of the company's shares, plans to spin off its stake to shareholders later this year, it has not yet done so.</p>
