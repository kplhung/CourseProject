        <p>Detroit's troubled school district has selected as its new chief executive Kenneth Burnley, a Colorado Springs superintendent known for making tough decisions and increasing parental involvement.</p>
        <p>Dr. Burnley, a 58-year-old Detroit native, will take over the 172,000-student district, Michigan's largest, at a time of immense turmoil. It will be his job to shepherd a $1.4 billion bond construction project for 69 new schools, raise test scores, which for years have trailed state and national averages, and repair a payroll system that routinely issues late checks.</p>
        <p>He will also be responsible for a $1.9 billion budget, 10 times the budget of Colorado Springs District No. 11, where he worked for 13 years. That district, which has struggled financially, has 263 schools and 33,500 students.</p>
        <p>''This won't be an easy job,'' said Dr. Burnley, who was superintendent of schools in Fairbanks, Alaska, before moving to Colorado. ''There is a lot of heavy lifting that needs to be done to focus on our young people.''</p>
        <p>He said he would commute between Detroit and Colorado Springs through the end of June. The job here, which could pay him up to $250,000 a year, is unusual because, as the school district's chief executive, he can approve budgets and contracts without consulting a school board. The position was created last year when the state took over the district and removed its superintendent and elected school board.</p>
        <p>Choosing Dr. Burnley took the Detroit board 11 months, a job that proved challenging in part because at least a dozen other cities are looking for school superintendents, and the jobs have become increasingly difficult to fill.</p>
        <p>Adding to the difficulty was a complicated state school reform law that allows Michigan's governor, John Engler, to appoint one of the district's seven board members and grant that person sole veto power in the selection of a new chief executive. Mayor Dennis Archer appoints the other six members of the board.</p>
        <p>In January the board's first choice, John Thomson, former superintendent of schools in Tulsa, Okla., was vetoed by Governor Engler's appointee, Mark Murray, the state treasurer.</p>
        <p>But after a three-hour interview late Thursday night, the board took just five minutes to select Dr. Burnley unanimously.</p>
        <p>''His leadership, his vision were all well stated ,'' said Freeman Hendrix, the board's chairman. ''He did more than just talk philosophically about what needs to happen.''</p>
        <p>The fact that Dr. Burnley is a graduate of the district and was reared in a pro-union family in this heavily unionized city were bonuses, Mr. Hendrix said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murray said he did not regret delaying Detroit's search.</p>
        <p>''This is a very powerful position,'' he said. ''You take as much time as you need to make a good choice.''</p>
        <p>People familiar with Dr. Burnley's work in Colorado Springs say he is capable of wrestling with Detroit's problems. Critics and supporters in Colorado Springs cheer him for creating an outreach program that has recruited more than 7,000 parents as volunteers.</p>
        <p>In 1993 the American Association of School Administrators named Dr. Burnley superintendent of the year. He also gained attention that year by making the district the first in the nation to allow major companies to advertise in the schools. Through contracts with more than 50 companies, the district has been able to draw $100,000 a year.</p>
        <p>In November, Dr. Burnley was criticized for recommending that the district close five schools to save money after a school taxation plan failed. The board sided with the community, deciding to keep the schools open for at least a year.</p>
        <p>''Sometimes he doesn't listen as well as he should,'' said Kathy Glasmann, president of the Colorado Springs Education Association. ''But he's very pro-teacher and willing to try new things. It's a real loss.''</p>
