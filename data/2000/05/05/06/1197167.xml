        <p>The on-again, off-again merger talks between the WPP Group of Britain and Young &amp; Rubicam Inc. are on again. A week after negotiations between the two advertising companies broke down, WPP said today that it had returned to the bargaining table in hopes of reviving a takeover of Y.&amp; R., which is based in New York.</p>
        <p>At the same time, Young &amp; Rubicam continues to be courted by Publicis S.A., the French advertising company. According to executives close to the talks, the chief executive of Y.&amp; R., Thomas D. Bell Jr., is negotiating with both companies again, seeking to take advantage of each company's ambition to add Y.&amp; R. to its holdings.</p>
        <p>Now that Mr. Bell has two suitors for Y.&amp; R., he may be able to instigate a bidding war between them.</p>
        <p>A deal between WPP and Y.&amp; R., which has already been derailed twice, would create the world's largest advertising company in billings and revenue and would be the richest agency company takeover in history. WPP, which owns Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, J. Walter Thompson and the public relations agency Hill &amp; Knowlton, is keen to take control of Y.&amp; R. to add even more mass and scale to its ever-growing operations as the industry continues to consolidate.</p>
        <p>Y.&amp; R. is one of the last few big independent agency companies, which makes it particularly attractive to Sir Martin Sorrell, the acquisitive, ambitious chief executive at WPP.</p>
        <p>The last time the talks ended, both sides wagged their fingers at the other in a public scuffle, with conflicting versions of who was at fault. Executives from WPP accused Y.&amp; R. executives of changing the terms of the deal at the 11th hour, contending that the lawyer representing Y.&amp; R. wrote new details into the merger document by hand. Y.&amp; R. executives, for their part, asserted that WPP made oral and written assurances that were then not included in the document.</p>
        <p>The debate centered on to what extent WPP could make changes to Y.&amp; R. operations in the first year after the deal.</p>
        <p>Controversy also arose over Mr. Sorrell's plan to discourage Y.&amp; R.'s top executives from leaving the combined agency company by instituting a noncompete provision that would have effectively kept departing employees from working in the industry for a year. Y.&amp; R. managers considered the provision too harsh.</p>
        <p>Other disagreements occurred over severance packages and contractual matters.</p>
        <p>But on the most important issue, price, each side had a different story.</p>
        <p>Executives at WPP said they believed Y.&amp; R. had agreed that its British suitor would pay about $5 billion. Executives at Y.&amp; R. said no deal had been struck on the price of the transaction.</p>
        <p>It is unclear what changed to bring WPP back to the bargaining table, but executives close to the talks said both agency companies might be willing to make more concessions. Mr. Sorrell, the executives say, wants to agree to a friendly deal with Y.&amp; R., though they portrayed him as not averse to a hostile bid. Indeed, it was through a hostile takeover of Ogilvy &amp; Mather that Mr. Sorrell turned WPP into what is now the world's third-largest agency company.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bell's interest in a deal with WPP has also been reignited, though executives close to the talks said Mr. Bell's relationship with Mr. Sorrell had soured.</p>
        <p>A tie-up between WPP and Y.&amp; R. is more compelling than a deal with Publicis, an executive close to Y.&amp; R. said, because both WPP and Y.&amp; R. serve some of the same clients -- like Ford, Kraft, Mattel and Sears -- and do not have major client conflicts. By comparison, Y.&amp; R. and Publicis could have a major client conflict because Y.&amp; R. works for Ford Motor and Publicis works for General Motors (through an American agency, Publicis &amp; Hal Riney in San Francisco) and for Renault.</p>
        <p>On the New York Stock Exchange, shares of Young &amp; Rubicam rose $4.50, or 9 percent, to $54.125. American depository receipts of WPP -- with each A.D.R. representing five shares -- fell $5.50, or 6.8 percent, to $75.50. Publicis shares fell 18 euros, or 3.3 percent, to 534 euros on the Paris bourse.</p>
