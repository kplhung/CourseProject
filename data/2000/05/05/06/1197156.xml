        <p>The Jets, lashed by extraordinary tumult this off-season, finally found some counterbalance yesterday when Bill Parcells ended months of speculation and decided to remain with the organization for at least the coming season as the director of football operations.</p>
        <p>''I indicated some time ago that I would not abandon this franchise,'' Parcells said in a statement. ''I look forward to working with Woody Johnson and Al Groh in a collective effort to try to bring a championship to New York. I view my job very simply -- to try to get good players for the coach.''</p>

        <p>The Jets, lashed by extraordinary tumult this off-season, finally found some counterbalance yesterday when Bill Parcells ended months of speculation and decided to remain with the organization for at least the coming season as the director of football operations.</p>
        <p>''I indicated some time ago that I would not abandon this franchise,'' Parcells said in a statement. ''I look forward to working with Woody Johnson and Al Groh in a collective effort to try to bring a championship to New York. I view my job very simply -- to try to get good players for the coach.''</p>
        <p>Parcells, who retired as the Jets' head coach Jan. 3 only to watch his handpicked successor, Bill Belichick, quit the next day, had considered leaving the organization to pursue a job in broadcasting.</p>
        <p>When Johnson bought the Jets, Parcells said he would stay on as director of football operations and that the two would revisit the issue later in the year. Johnson said he had hoped to know Parcells's decision by the time training camp began in July. Parcells took himself out of the running for a job with ''Monday Night Football,'' but had negotiations with both ESPN and Fox for analyst jobs.</p>
        <p>In recent weeks, though, Parcells's actions indicated that he was leaning toward staying with the Jets. He was actively involved in the trade of receiver Keyshawn Johnson and was in the Jets' war room with Groh, the head coach, during the draft. He has worked particularly closely with Mike Tannenbaum, who is in charge of the salary cap and player contracts, and they will continue to work together to try to sign the team's four first-round draft picks.</p>
        <p>Parcells also attended every practice at the Jets' rookie minicamp last weekend, and at a golf outing this week he said that it was the news media that had said he was going to retire. Now he will remain with the Jets indefinitely.</p>
        <p>''I am obviously delighted that Bill Parcells has decided to stay with the New York Jets,'' Woody Johnson said in a statement. ''Our sole objective since the purchase of the team has been to create a winning organization, attitude and team. Having Bill around to help us through this period is an enormous advantage to the franchise.''</p>
        <p>Parcells's presence will provide continuity to an organization racked by his resignation as coach, while also lengthening the considerable shadow in which Groh will operate. But the Jets still have to figure out a way to sign their four first-round draft picks, and perhaps acquire a veteran wide receiver, despite little room under the salary cap.</p>
        <p>Parcells's decision restores a measure of calm to the organization. Last week Groh said that he and Parcells talked frequently about players and trends in the league. Parcells was an especially good resource, Groh said, because Parcells could appreciate what head coaches go through to a depth that assistant coaches were not aware of. At the rookie camp, Parcells seemed to take special care to remain well away from the coaching staff -- he had sought, and received, permission from Groh just to attend -- and instead remained on the sideline talking to Woody Johnson or occasionally pulling a player aside for personal instruction.</p>
        <p>''Bill's decision to remain in his current position meant we kept a Hall of Fame performer on our team,'' Groh said. ''What could be better than that? He is a valued friend and trusted colleague to me, so personally I am very happy that he will be here as a resource to me.''</p>
