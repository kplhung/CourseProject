        <p>The NBC mini-series ''Jason and the Argonauts,'' like any good epic, has profound questions at its heart. What drives men to pursue the seemingly unattainable? Are there limits to love and friendship? And what is that thing on Dennis Hopper's head?</p>
        <p>Mr. Hopper, sporting a curly coiffure and a creepily understated malevolence, is one of the high points of this often entertaining account of Jason, the hero of Greek legend, and his quest for the Golden Fleece. So odd is Mr. Hopper's get-up -- he plays Pelias, the king with a penchant for stabbing his relatives -- that when he first appears in tomorrow's opening installment it is difficult to recognize him. But then comes that voice.</p>

        <p>The NBC mini-series ''Jason and the Argonauts,'' like any good epic, has profound questions at its heart. What drives men to pursue the seemingly unattainable? Are there limits to love and friendship? And what is that thing on Dennis Hopper's head?</p>
        <p>Mr. Hopper, sporting a curly coiffure and a creepily understated malevolence, is one of the high points of this often entertaining account of Jason, the hero of Greek legend, and his quest for the Golden Fleece. So odd is Mr. Hopper's get-up -- he plays Pelias, the king with a penchant for stabbing his relatives -- that when he first appears in tomorrow's opening installment it is difficult to recognize him. But then comes that voice.</p>
        <p>Pelias covets the fleece far more than any animal hide ought to be coveted, and he sends Jason (Jason London), his nephew, to find it. Jason is given a ship, the Argo, and the underqualified crew he recruits becomes known as the Argonauts. Adventures ensue, watched over and manipulated by Zeus (Angus MacFadyen) and Hera (Olivia Williams).</p>
        <p>The mini-series, another lavish offering by the producing team of Robert Halmi Sr. and Robert Halmi Jr., doesn't quite capture the suicide-mission camaraderie that ought to prevail on Jason's ship. Half of the Argonauts are drowned or otherwise disposed of before they have made much of an impression on the screen. Of those who aren't, only Kieran O'Brien as a weaselly thief, Brian Thompson as Hercules and Olga Sosnovska as Jason's longtime friend-who-wishes-she-were-more-than-that are particularly memorable.</p>
        <p>But calamities, not character studies, are the main attraction here, and several of the ones the Argonauts blunder into are skillfully served. Poseidon, the sea god, is a huge, scaly fright. The Clashing Rocks, which come together to squash passing ships, are as believable as Clashing Rocks get. And once the voyagers reach Colchis, the island where the fleece hangs from a tree, they encounter the worst horror of them all: Frank Langella, playing the island's king, who appears to have the same hairdresser as Mr. Hopper.</p>
        <p>Those who think about this ''Jason'' too hard will readily find flaws. Why do some characters have British accents and others not? What law of physics allows the Argo to zip smartly along when its oars are barely reaching the water? When Jason, moments after being flame-broiled by the fire-breathing Minean Bull, stirs himself back to consciousness, would his buddies back there in B.C. Greece really have shouted a Marv Albert-like ''Yessss!''?</p>
        <p>But there is no need to nitpick. It's more fun to trace the antecedents of the various effects, like beasties that could have been plucked from ''Jurassic Park'' or the ''Terminator'' movies, and a talking statue that is a cinematic descendant of Babe.</p>
        <p>It's also amusing, for anyone whose mythology classes have merged into one big blob since graduation, to try to guess what's coming  for the Argonauts. Is this the part where they meet the Cyclopes? (Well, no, that was . . .) Wait, it's the Sirens, right? (No, you're thinking of. . . .) Wait, I've got it; it's the Harpies, isn't it? (Yessss!)</p>
        <p>And viewers can spend some of their idle time simply marveling at the restraint of the cast and crew, especially at one moment near the end. Jason has made it back home with the fleece, which turns out to be a mangy rag still attached to the skull of its original four-legged owner. Pelias's son, Acastus (Tom Harper), has snatched the fleece to try to impress dad. Pelias and Acastus come face to face, Pelias in his goofy curls, Acastus wearing the ratty-looking fleece on his noggin.</p>
        <p>And no one bursts out laughing. But there's a sense that there was a lot of laughing on the inside. When this ''Jason'' works, that is why: it's drama wrapped around a sense of fun.</p>
