        <p>Before a record crowd of 106,156 fans on the day before the Kentucky Derby, the filly Secret Status ran away from 13 rivals to win the Kentucky Oaks today by 6 1/4 lengths.</p>
        <p>Pat Day rode the filly to her runaway victory, six weeks after she had won the Florida Oaks.

The winner of last year's Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies, Cash Run, trained by D. Wayne Lukas with Jerry Bailey riding, stalked the lead but then faded late to finish next to last.</p>

        <p>Before a record crowd of 106,156 fans on the day before the Kentucky Derby, the filly Secret Status ran away from 13 rivals to win the Kentucky Oaks today by 6 1/4 lengths.</p>
        <p>Pat Day rode the filly to her runaway victory, six weeks after she had won the Florida Oaks. And after widening her lead through the homestretch, she finished far in front of Rings a Chime, who had a length and a half on Classy Clara, with Miss Seffens fourth. The winner of last year's Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies, Cash Run, trained by D. Wayne Lukas with Jerry Bailey riding, stalked the lead but then faded late to finish next to last.</p>
        <p>Secret Status ran the mile and one-eighth in 1:504/5 , paid $11.80 for a $2 bet to win and earned $300,000. The victory was her fourth in five starts.</p>
        <p>Also running today was Silverbulletday, who launched her 4-year-old season by winning by a neck at Keeneland and was the even-money favorite in the $250,000 Louisville Breeders' Cup. Even with Bailey riding, she could not stay with Heritage of Gold, who won her third race in a row and 13th in 21 career starts. Roza Robata was second, Bella Chiarra third and Silverbulletday fourth, three lengths off the lead.</p>
