        <p>A Long Island couple who bought a well-known gay bar and restaurant on Fire Island in a bankruptcy sale 16 months ago filed a lawsuit today in Federal District Court here, charging the Town of Brookhaven and four of its officials with anti-gay bias and illegally preventing the reopening of the bar.</p>
        <p>The couple, Patrick and Joanne McEvoy, had hoped, with the help of their gay son, Michael, to rebuild and extensively refurbish the establishment, the Monster Millennium Restaurant, in Cherry Grove, a predominantly gay Fire Island community in the Town of Brookhaven.

        <p>A Long Island couple who bought a well-known gay bar and restaurant on Fire Island in a bankruptcy sale 16 months ago filed a lawsuit today in Federal District Court here, charging the Town of Brookhaven and four of its officials with anti-gay bias and illegally preventing the reopening of the bar.</p>
        <p>The couple, Patrick and Joanne McEvoy, had hoped, with the help of their gay son, Michael, to rebuild and extensively refurbish the establishment, the Monster Millennium Restaurant, in Cherry Grove, a predominantly gay Fire Island community in the Town of Brookhaven. They first planned to reopen last summer.</p>
        <p>But they charge in their 18-page complaint that they were prevented at every turn from redeveloping the bar on the former premises of the Monster Restaurant and Discotheque, a popular gay bar.</p>
        <p>The suit charges that Brookhaven officials harassed the McEvoys, their contractors and their patrons by threatening to shut down the building. The McEvoys are seeking $10 million in civil damages and $15 million in punitive damages.</p>
        <p>The suit said the town officials also expressed a personal anti-gay bias, making statements like ''We're sick to death of you gays thinking you can go ahead and do whatever you want out here on Fire Island,'' and ''Your people don't have families,'' followed by a derogatory term.</p>
        <p>In addition to the Town of Brookhaven, the suit also names as defendants Vincent Dragone, a building inspector; Joseph Mirabella, a deputy town attorney; Thomas Moore, a building inspector, and Jay Sauerwein, the town's chief fire marshal.</p>
        <p>Jessie Garcia, a spokesman for Brookhaven, said the town was reviewing the lawsuit. However, at first glance, he said, ''It appears that this is nothing more than an abuse of the judicial system to try to force the town and the state to issue permits so they can open the bar by Memorial Day.</p>
        <p>''We've been working with the applicants for more than a year, and the town is still awaiting approval by the state concerning a request by the applicants for a state building and fire code variance,'' Mr. Garcia said. ''This is a wooden building and we want to make certain, especially since it is a place of assembly, that those who patronize it will be safe.''</p>
        <p>But the McEvoys claim that town officials conspired to block the reconstruction of the bar by arbitrarily refusing to grant the necessary permits, fire approvals and a certificate of occupancy.</p>
        <p>''The McEvoys had planned on opening for the season next week,'' said their lawyer, Robert M. Calica, of Garden City. ''They've already lost one season and they hope that injunctive relief will spare them further harm.''</p>
