        <p>In the current Broadway revival of Tom Stoppard's ''Real Thing,'' Stephen Dillane portrays Henry, a playwright whose wife, Annie (Jennifer Ehle), has asked his opinion of a play by a young, lower-class jailed activist named Brodie. At the urging of supporters like Annie, Brodie wrote a play about his case to drum up support for his release. Henry reads the script and ridicules it.</p>
        <p>ANNIE: You're jealous of the idea of the writer. You want to keep it sacred, special, not something anybody can do. Some of us have it, some of us don't. We write, you get written about. What gets you about Brodie is he doesn't know his place. You say he can't write like a headwaiter saying you can't come in here without a tie. Because he can't put words together. What's so good about putting words together?</p>

        <p>In the current Broadway revival of Tom Stoppard's ''Real Thing,'' Stephen Dillane portrays Henry, a playwright whose wife, Annie (Jennifer Ehle), has asked his opinion of a play by a young, lower-class jailed activist named Brodie. At the urging of supporters like Annie, Brodie wrote a play about his case to drum up support for his release. Henry reads the script and ridicules it.</p>
        <p>ANNIE: You're jealous of the idea of the writer. You want to keep it sacred, special, not something anybody can do. Some of us have it, some of us don't. We write, you get written about. What gets you about Brodie is he doesn't know his place. You say he can't write like a headwaiter saying you can't come in here without a tie. Because he can't put words together. What's so good about putting words together?</p>
        <p>HENRY: It's traditionally considered advantageous for a writer.</p>
        <p>ANNIE: He's not a writer. He's a convict. You're a writer. You write because you're a writer. Even when you write about something, you have to think up something to write about just so you can keep writing. More well chosen nicely put together. So what? Why should that be it? Who says?</p>
        <p>HENRY: Nobody says. It just works best.</p>
        <p>ANNIE: Of course it works. You teach a lot of people what to expect from good writing, and you end up with a lot of people saying you write well. Then somebody who isn't in on the game comes along, like Brodie, who really has something to write about, something real, and you can't get through it. Well, he couldn't get through yours, so where are you? To you, he can't write. To him, write is all you can do.</p>
        <p>HENRY: . . . Annie you're beginning to appall  me. There's something scary about stupidity made coherent. I can deal with idiots, and I can deal with sensible argument, but I don't know how to deal with you. Where's my cricket bat?</p>
        <p>ANNIE: Your cricket bat?</p>
        <p>HENRY: Yes. It's a new approach.</p>
        <p>ANNIE: Are you trying to be funny?</p>
        <p>HENRY: No, I'm serious. (He goes out while she watches in wary disbelief. He returns with an old cricket bat.) . . . This thing here, which looks like a wooden club, is actually several pieces of particular wood cunningly put together in a certain way so that the whole thing is sprung, like a dance floor. It's for hitting cricket balls with. If you get it right, the cricket ball will travel 200 yards in four seconds, and all you've done is give it a knock like knocking the top off a bottle of stout, and it makes a noise like a trout taking a fly. (He clucks his tongue to make the noise.) What we're trying to do is to write cricket bats, so that when we throw up an idea and give it a little knock, it might travel. (He clucks his tongue again and picks up the script.) Now, what we've got here is a lump of wood of roughly the same shape trying to be a cricket bat, and if you hit a ball with it, the ball will travel about 10 feet and you will drop the bat and dance about shouting ''Ouch!'' with your hands stuck into your armpits. This isn't better because someone says it's better, or because there's a conspiracy by the M.C.C. to keep cudgels off the field. It's better because it's better. You don't believe me, so I suggest you go out to bat with this and see how you get on. ''You're a strange boy, Billy, how old are you?'' ''Twenty, but I've lived more than you'll ever live.'' Ooh, ouch!</p>
        <p>ANNIE: I hate you.</p>
        <p>HENRY: I love you. I'm your pal. I'm your best mate. I look after you. You're the only chap.</p>
        <p>ANNIE: Oh Hen. Can't you help?</p>
        <p>HENRY: What did you expect me to do?</p>
        <p>ANNIE: Well, cut it and shape it.</p>
        <p>HENRY: Cut it and shape it. Henry of Mayfair. Look -- he can't write. I would have to write it for him.</p>
        <p>ANNIE: Well, write it for him.</p>
        <p>HENRY: I can't. . .  Announcing every stale revelation of the newly enlightened like stout Cortez coming upon the Pacific -- war is profits, politicians are puppets, Parliament is a farce, justice is a fraud, property is theft. . . .</p>
        <p>ANNIE: And who wrote it, why he wrote, where he wrote it -- none of these things count with you?</p>
        <p>HENRY: Leave me out of it. They don't count. Maybe Brodie got a raw deal, maybe he didn't. I don't know. It doesn't count. He's a lout with language. I can't help somebody who thinks, or thinks he thinks, that editing a newspaper is censorship, or that throwing bricks is a demonstration while building tower blocks is social violence, or that unpalatable statement is provocation while disrupting the speaker is the exercise of free speech. Words don't deserve that kind of malarkey. They're innocent, neutral, precise, standing for this, describing that, meaning the other, so if you look after them you can build bridges across incomprehension and chaos. But when they get their corners knocked off, they're no good anymore, and Brodie knocks their corners off. I don't think writers are sacred, but words are. They deserve respect. If you get the right ones in the right order, you can nudge the world a little or make a poem which children will speak for you when you're dead.</p>
