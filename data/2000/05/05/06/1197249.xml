        <p>The Pataki administration has called a timeout in the battle to build a major Indian casino in the Catskills, where the St. Regis Mohawk tribe has signed separate deals with two competing developers.</p>
        <p>Last month the federal Interior Department approved a long-standing plan by a company, Catskill Development, to build a $500 million casino with the Mohawks at the Monticello Raceway. Supporters hope a casino will revive the depressed resort area. But since the approval was granted, the Mohawks have turned their backs on their original partners and signed a new deal with Park Place Entertainment, the largest gambling company in the world.</p>
        <p>This week, the Pataki administration, whose approval is needed for any casino project, wrote to the Interior Department saying that it was ''not possible to consider taking further action until this situation is clarified,'' given the confusion surrounding the relationships and roles of the various parties.</p>
        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki has advocated development of Indian casinos in former resort areas like the Catskills, and he was in the midst of reviewing the raceway proposal. He was expected to give his approval to the raceway casino if the tribe settled its land claims with the state, said tribal advisers and state officials. But the emergence of a second deal with the Mohawks has muddled the situation.</p>
        <p>''We don't think it's appropriate to move forward until we get clarification as to what's happening,'' said Michael McKeon, a spokesman for Governor Pataki. ''We've got all kinds of lawsuits, all kinds of questions being raised. The feedback from Washington is that the governor's tack is the right way to go.''</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for the Interior Department said officials there were just as confused by the casino battle. ''We still haven't heard anything from the tribe,'' said the spokeswoman, Stephanie Hanna. ''But the governor has apparently chosen to stop the clock for now.''</p>
        <p>The sudden turnabout by the Mohawks, whose reservation is 350 miles north of the Catskills on the Canadian border, has mystified the tribe's supporters in Washington, angered elected officials in the Catskills and spawned several lawsuits, including one by dissident Mohawks who charge that their chiefs were duped by Park Place. The company, they say, intends to protect its three casinos in Atlantic City rather than help the impoverished tribe.</p>
        <p>Because the Catskills are only 90 minutes from New York City, a casino there is expected to generate more than $1 billion a year.</p>
        <p>The Mohawk chiefs have not returned telephone calls requesting comment. The Bureau of Indian Affairs and the National Indian Gaming Commission, which oversees management contracts between casino operators and tribes, said they had not been notified that the chiefs  had abandoned their original agreement with Catskill Development at the Monticello Raceway.</p>
        <p>But Arthur M. Goldberg, chief executive of Park Place, announced plans this week to build a gambling resort at Kutsher's Country Club, which is about five miles north of the raceway. County legislators, who had been working on the raceway project for the last four years, criticized Mr. Goldberg's newly announced project, saying it would take years to win the necessary government approvals.</p>
        <p>Robert A. Berman, a partner in Catskill Development, said that his rival, Mr. Goldberg, had achieved his true goal: delaying, perhaps forever, construction of a gambling hall in the Catskills that might compete with its own casinos in Atlantic City.</p>
        <p>''Right now, Atlantic City is probably having a champagne toast in celebration of their robbing New York State of this important economic development,'' he said. ''In the final analysis, we believe that Governor Pataki will not be muscled in his own state by New Jersey interests.''</p>
        <p>Catskill Development, which owns the only site that already has federal approval for an Indian casino, recently began talking to other tribes about the possibility of a casino deal.</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldberg responded Thursday to accusations that he was trying to block a casino in the Catskills with a promise. ''We'll pay the tribe $100 million cash if we don't build as soon as we get approval,'' he said.</p>
        <p>He and the six St. Regis Mohawk chiefs signed a secret agreement on April 14 granting Park Place exclusive rights to build and manage Mohawk casinos in New York and renouncing the original contract at the raceway. But Mr. Goldberg said this week that neither he nor the tribe had ruled out building a ''temporary casino'' at the raceway while his plan went through the licensing process. That prompted some gambling analysts to suggest that Mr. Goldberg might be trying to force Catskill Development into selling the raceway for a bargain price.</p>
        <p>Federal officials said that Mr. Goldberg would have to file a new application to build an Indian casino at Kutsher's, a process that could take two to four years.</p>
        <p>As for Governor Pataki's decision to stop reviewing the project until the smoke clears, a spokesman for Park Place said he was unfazed.</p>
        <p>But Park Place may find it hard to win approvals from Monticello officials who wrote a letter this week asking the state attorney general, Eliot L. Spitzer, to look into the deal with the Mohawks.</p>
        <p>In a different letter to the tribe, Rusty Pomeroy, chairman of the Sullivan County Legislature, said that the Mohawks had placed the entire project in jeopardy and that they should not assume that the county would support a new application.</p>
