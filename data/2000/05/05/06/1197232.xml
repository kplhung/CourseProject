        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The rap artist Chuck D is right to be frustrated by a music industry that is controlled by a dwindling number of corporations (Op-Ed, April 29). But he is wrong to think of distribution of music on the Internet as ''a new kind of radio,'' or ''a promotional tool,'' and to suggest that performers give away their work.</p>
        <p>Doesn't he know that broadcasters rip off performers when their work is played? Our antiquated copyright law grants royalties for such commercial use only to composers, lyricists and publishers.</p>

        <p>Instead of finding another way to give away their talents, musicians would do better to demand the modernization of copyright law to compensate them whenever their recorded performances generate profits.</p>
