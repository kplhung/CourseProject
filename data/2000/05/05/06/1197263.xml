        <p>The Mets arrived here tired and concerned, reeling from a late-night flight from San Francisco and a four-game losing streak. Al Leiter came to Pro Player Stadium concerned but not so tired. The left-handed pitcher was allowed to travel here Thursday morning, nearly a full day ahead of his team.</p>
        <p>And while his teammates periodically looked lethargic tonight, Leiter provided the lift that got the Mets back on a winning track. His four-hit pitching over seven innings helped the Mets defeat the Florida Marlins, 4-1, before 30,229.</p>
        <p>The Mets arrived in South Florida about 1:30 a.m. today, still brooding about a four-game sweep at the hands of the Giants. And it was not until nearly 3 a.m. that they checked into their hotel.</p>
        <p>''I can't worry about who's tired or how long our losing streak is,'' Leiter said. ''I'd probably get myself tied in knots if I did that. I just concentrate on doing my job.''</p>
        <p>And he did, allowing just one run while striking out nine. ''I felt aggressive on all my pitches, and Mike continued to call all my pitches,'' said Leiter, referring to catcher Mike Piazza. ''I just love this mound. I usually pitch well here.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, he pitched here in Game 7 of the 1997 World Series, which was won by the Marlins.</p>
        <p>''There's kind of a blurry picture behind the catcher and umpire,'' Leiter said. ''And I just get a real good feeling. There are certain stadiums and mounds that do that, and this is certainly one of them.''</p>
        <p>For the most part, the Mets felt like the home team tonight, a reflection of how many ex-New Yorkers and vacationing New Yorkers are in South Florida. Many in the crowd cheered loudly for them, particularly when Leiter worked out of jams in the sixth and seventh innings.</p>
        <p>''He's the best pitcher in the National League with men on base,'' Marlins Manager John Boles said after Leiter improved his record to 3-0 and the Mets' to 17-14.</p>
        <p>A far bigger surprise than Leiter's winning was that the veteran John Franco, who had not had a save since last June, was given the ball to start the ninth. He retired the Marlins in order and got the save.</p>
        <p>Armando Benitez, the Mets' usual closer, had had three shaky appearances in a row, but Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said before the game that he planned to stick with him. Valentine said later that the oft-used Benitez could have thrown to one batter tonight, but no more.</p>
        <p>''It didn't surprise me,'' Franco, second to Lee Smith on the career saves list, said of his ninth-inning work. ''But it feels good to contribute on the positive side.''</p>
        <p>The Mets used Rickey Henderson's quickness to take a one-run lead in the first inning. Henderson walked against the former Mets minor leaguer Jesus Sanchez to lead off the game. With a 2-2 count on the next hitter, Derek Bell, Henderson bolted for second base and Bell executed a perfect hit-and-run through the spot that Marlins second baseman Luis Castillo had just vacated.</p>
        <p>With Henderson now on third, Edgardo Alfonzo drove him home with a fly ball.</p>
        <p>The Mets added another run in the second. Robin Ventura singled and came around on Rey Ordonez's two-out double down the left-field line.  Florida got a run back in the second when shortstop Alex Gonzalez hit a two-out double to right-center field and then scored as first baseman Todd Zeile could not handle Mike Redmond's little floater.</p>
        <p>But Piazza made it 3-1 in the fourth, leading off with a home run.</p>
        <p>Sanchez grew more difficult to hit from there, retiring 11 of the next 12 batters, while Leiter held off the Marlins. His biggest challenge came in the sixth, when Castillo led off with a disputed bunt single. Mark Kotsay struck out, but Cliff Floyd and Preston Wilson walked to load the bases. Leiter then struck out Mike Lowell and Derrek Lee to end the inning.</p>
        <p>Leiter raised his career record against his former team to 5-1.</p>
        <p>''Al was terrific,'' Valentine said. ''He really pulled up his bootstraps in the sixth and seventh innings and did a great job. Maybe he started a little roll for our starting pitchers.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>TURK WENDELL sprained his right ankle recently and was held out of Friday night's game. . . . Within a week, center fielder DARRYL HAMILTON will undergo surgery on his left big toe, the team said.</p>
