      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says there may never be full accounting of terrorist plot that brought down Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988, but trial of two Libyan suspects in Netherlands offers best chance to establish measure of responsibility for deaths of 270 people</p>

        <p>There may never be a full accounting of the terror plot that brought down Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, just before Christmas in 1988. But the trial of two suspects that began this week in the Netherlands offers the best chance so far to establish at least a measure of responsibility for the attack, which killed 270 people. That the case has come to court at all is a tribute to the persistence of British investigators and some skillful diplomacy by Kofi Annan, the secretary general of the United Nations.</p>
        <p>The two Libyan defendants, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah,  were indicted nine years ago in the United States after one of the most intensive manhunts in history. They are accused of packing plastic explosives inside a Toshiba boom box and shipping the device in a suitcase from Malta to Frankfurt to London, where it was placed aboard the Pan Am flight, which was headed to New York. Investigators say the two men, who have denied any role in the attack, were Libyan intelligence agents.</p>

        <p>There may never be a full accounting of the terror plot that brought down Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, just before Christmas in 1988. But the trial of two suspects that began this week in the Netherlands offers the best chance so far to establish at least a measure of responsibility for the attack, which killed 270 people. That the case has come to court at all is a tribute to the persistence of British investigators and some skillful diplomacy by Kofi Annan, the secretary general of the United Nations.</p>
        <p>The two Libyan defendants, Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi and Al Amin Khalifa Fhimah,  were indicted nine years ago in the United States after one of the most intensive manhunts in history. They are accused of packing plastic explosives inside a Toshiba boom box and shipping the device in a suitcase from Malta to Frankfurt to London, where it was placed aboard the Pan Am flight, which was headed to New York. Investigators say the two men, who have denied any role in the attack, were Libyan intelligence agents.</p>
        <p>The trial reflects the diplomatic maneuvering that made it possible. The site is a former NATO air base in the Netherlands, but the trial is being conducted under Scottish law before three Scottish judges, who will render the verdict. This satisfies Libyan demands for a neutral location without compromising prosecution of the case. Mr. Annan was helpful in making these arrangements.</p>
        <p>The relatives of some of the 189 Americans killed in the attack fear the prosecution is misguided because it failed to implicate others who may have ordered the bombing, including top Libyan officials. Some relatives also believe that Syria and Iran may have played a central role in the plot. These concerns are valid, but they ought not to diminish the importance of the trial. If the guilt of the two Libyans is established by hundreds of witnesses who will testify and the thousands of bits of evidence that will be introduced, they should be convicted and sentenced to life in prison in Scotland.</p>
        <p>It is unfortunate that the Clinton administration seems ready to consider a thaw in relations with Libya as the trial opens. Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan leader, has behaved with greater moderation in recent months, and Britain re-established diplomatic relations with Libya last summer. But it is far from clear that Mr. Qaddafi has made a full conversion after years of promoting terrorism around the world. As part of the compromise arrangements for the trial, U.N. sanctions against Libyan air travel and imports of vital industrial equipment have been lifted. That is sufficient relief for now. Separate American sanctions against Libya should remain in place.</p>
