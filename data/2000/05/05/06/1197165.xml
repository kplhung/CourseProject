        <p>Representatives of Swiss commercial banks and Holocaust survivors are expected to present the final details of a $1.25 billion restitution settlement to a federal judge next week after two of the largest banks agreed to give the survivors' lawyers access to databases containing information on 2.1 million Nazi-era accounts, the lead lawyer for the survivors said yesterday.</p>
        <p>The lawyer, Burt Neuborne, said the agreement, which was reached at a two-and-a-half-hour meeting on Thursday with Judge Edward R. Korman of Federal District Court in Brooklyn, could greatly speed up the last bit of haggling about the settlement.</p>
        <p>''The hope is to give the judge a completed set of negotiations late next week so he can finalize the agreement,'' Mr. Neuborne said. ''I call it inching toward Jerusalem.''</p>
        <p>Although the Swiss banks and the Holocaust survivors reached the precedent-setting accord in August 1998 to create a billion-dollar fund intended to settle the claims of tens of thousands of people whose families lost assets in World War II, the negotiations have been hamstrung for months over the question of checking Swiss records to find additional claimants.</p>
        <p>Mr. Neuborne and Paul A. Volcker, the chairman of an independent panel that conducted much of the investigative work in the case, wanted to create a centralized database that would have contained 4.1 million Swiss accounts set up from 1933 to 1945. The two banks, Credit Suisse and UBS, agreed to grant access to their own 2.1 million accounts, but scores of smaller banks, which control about another 2 million accounts, have so far declined to let the lawyers search their files.</p>
        <p>In December, the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons, the panel led by Mr. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, said a centralized database was needed ''to reach a speedy conclusion to the claims resolution process.'' Mr. Neuborne added yesterday that the power to sift through all accounts opened in wartime Switzerland was needed to ensure that no claimant was left unfound.</p>
        <p>In a letter to Mr. Volcker in February, Judge Korman supported the idea of a wide-ranging database, writing, ''I agree that the success of this effort depends on the willingness of the Swiss authorities to adopt your recommendation that a central archive of data on all 4.1 million accounts be established.''</p>
        <p>The Swiss originally balked at the proposal and, in March, authorized the creation of a much smaller database that included only 46,000 accounts. In a report issued in December, Mr. Volcker's panel had named those 46,000 accounts as the most likely to have been owned by Holocaust victims.</p>
        <p>Neither Credit Suisse nor UBS could be reached for comment yesterday. Roger M. Witten, a Washington-based lawyer who represents the banks, refused to discuss details of the agreement but said, ''Everybody wants to get to the point where the settlement is approved and the money is flowing to class members.''</p>
