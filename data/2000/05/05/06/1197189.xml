        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>WEIGHING BUDGET PROPOSALS -- Gov. George W. Bush of Texas began a news conference in San Diego yesterday with some heavy lifting: he waved two thick books that represented budget proposals he had sent to the Texas Legislature in 1997 and 1999, and he lit into Vice President Al Gore anew for suggesting that he did not produce such extensive spending blueprints. The books in his hand, Mr. Bush said, proved otherwise. Only the day before, Mr. Gore had pulled from his pocket a three-page document that he said was a copy of Mr. Bush's 1995 budget, telling a reporter that ''if you think that's a budget, then maybe I can convince you it's a duck.'' Mr. Bush turned to examples from later years and said he was wishing fervently for a campaign ''not full of hyperbole and distortion.''</p>

        <p>THE POLLS</p>
        <p>LEADING THE RACE FOR NO. 2 -- Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore remain tight-lipped about running mates, but an NBC News-Wall Street Journal poll has found that most voters have already made up their minds. Among Republicans and independents, 40 percent want Mr. Bush to pick Gen. Colin L. Powell, the retired chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, 20 percent favor Senator John McCain of Arizona and 15 percent favor Elizabeth Dole, the former secretary of labor. Among Democrats and independents, 33 percent want Mr. Gore to pick former Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey and 18 percent favor Senator Dianne Feinstein of California. The poll surveyed 1,003 registered voters from April 29 to May 1 and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.</p>

        <p>THE ADVERTISING</p>
        <p>A QUESTION OF INFLUENCE -- Increasingly this year, interest groups as prominent as the National Rifle Association and as obscure as Republicans for Clean Air are running television commercials intended to influence elections. This week Karl J. Sandstrom, a Democratic member of the Federal Election Commission, proposed that these groups be required to say whom they represented and where the money came from to pay for the advertising. But do not count on the matter going anywhere. Experts on election law say the commission probably has no authority to order the interest groups to report on their affairs.</p>

        <p>THE REFORM PARTY</p>
        <p>THE CHAIRMAN RESIGNS -- The chairman of the Reform Party, Pat Choate, resigned yesterday, citing an illness in his family. The vice chairman, Gerald Moan of Tucson, Ariz., will fill in until a new chairman is selected at the party's summer convention, Mr. Choate said. An ally of H. Ross Perot, the party's founder, Mr. Choate overcame a challenge to his leadership earlier this year from a wing of the party led by Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota.</p>
