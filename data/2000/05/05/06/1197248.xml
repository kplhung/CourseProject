        <p>As Howdy Doody cooled his heels in a secret Rhode Island bank vault, two lawyers tried today to persuade a United States District Court judge here to grant their clients custody of the famous puppet. Decades after entertaining millions of children in the early years of American television, Howdy has become a freckle-faced federal case.</p>
        <p>On one side of the Howdy lawsuit is the family of his former master, the puppeteer Rufus Rose; they believe that the little guy in the checkered shirt belongs to them. On the other side is the Detroit Institute of Arts, which claims that Mr. Rose, who died in 1975, had agreed to hand over Howdy when he retired.</p>
        <p>For the benefit of anyone under 40, Howdy Doody was the Michael Jordan of television puppets. Decked in jeans, a bandanna and a cowboy shirt, the star of ''The Howdy Doody Show'' ruled the airwaves from 1947 to 1960. A character called Buffalo Bob would open the show by asking the Peanut Gallery of 40 children, ''Say, kids, what time is it?''</p>
        <p>''It's Howdy Doody time!'' was always the cheerful reply.</p>
        <p>In the lawsuit, filed in August 1999, the Detroit Institute said it was time to hand over the marionette, which the suit referred to as Original Howdy to distinguish it from several stand-ins created over the years.</p>
        <p>At today's hearing, lawyers for the Rose family and the museum filed cross motions for summary judgment, a way of asking Judge Christopher Droney to decide who owns Howdy without calling in a jury.</p>
        <p>Stuart D. Rosen, the lawyer for the art museum, said a series of letters in 1966 and 1967 that were signed by Mr. Rose and NBC, which produced the show, clearly state that the art museum would get Howdy.</p>
        <p>''The last letter established that there was an agreement to give Mr. Rose ownership of all the Howdy Doody characters with the exception of the original puppet,'' which was to be given to the museum when Mr. Rose was finished with it, Mr. Rosen said.</p>
        <p>Mark E. Block, a lawyer for the Rose family, said the letters did not clearly say that Mr. Rose intended to give Howdy to the museum. He also said, ''The puppet that we have we do not believe is the original puppet as defined by the Detroit Institute.''</p>
        <p>He added, ''As the puppet got damaged, they'd take arms, legs, bodies from other puppets and interchange them. This one could have parts from multiple puppets,'' he said, referring to the Howdy in lock-down at the Rhode Island bank, which he would not identify.</p>
        <p>Judge Droney allowed each side two weeks to submit supporting documents. After that, he will issue a decision, a process that could take weeks or even months, lawyers said.</p>
        <p>In a 1998 agreement signed by one of Mr. Rose's sons, Christopher, and Robert E. Smith, who played Buffalo Bob, the two men agreed to sell Original Howdy. One auctioneer said Original Howdy could fetch $50,000 to $1 million.</p>
