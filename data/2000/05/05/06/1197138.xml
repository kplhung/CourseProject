        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>I agree with Peter Steinfels (Beliefs, April 29) that the American culture needs a better forum for public discussion than television, with its emphasis on sound bites. I am not concerned, however, about theologians who fear they would be misconstrued and attacked if they spoke on  television about their views that ''Christian churches should not revise their teachings to bless same-sex unions or ordain gay men and lesbians who do not intend to live by their church's existing sexual standards.''</p>

        <p>Just think of the courage a gay person must have to appear in televised discussions. Think how courageous it is for gay clergy members to appear in televised discussions. I doubt these clergy members would lose their jobs and homes or be beaten up for stating their views.</p>
