        <p>One of the thorniest problems facing dance is how to keep the classics of the past alive yet authentic. Videotaping and dance notation now augment the age-old handing down of dances from one performer to another. But what about differences in individual interpretation or even a choreographer's different versions? Which should be the interpretation of record? Those questions are addressed in impressive depth in Michael Blackwood's ''Balanchine Lives!'' on WNET (Channel 13 in New York) tomorrow at 7 p.m. and Tuesday at 1 a.m.</p>
        <p>Balanchine shrugged off the matter of his legacy. He redid dances and allowed performers to shape them individually. But with the creation of  the George Balanchine Trust, whose work has become a model for the licensing of dances, Balanchine's work had a head start on life after his death. Interviews with 14 former New York City Ballet and Balanchine-trained dancers, some of whom stage ballets for the trust and others who direct ballet companies throughout the United States and in Europe, suggest that the best method may still be the transmission of choreography through the memories and examples of those who worked directly with the creator.</p>

        <p>One of the thorniest problems facing dance is how to keep the classics of the past alive yet authentic. Videotaping and dance notation now augment the age-old handing down of dances from one performer to another. But what about differences in individual interpretation or even a choreographer's different versions? Which should be the interpretation of record? Those questions are addressed in impressive depth in Michael Blackwood's ''Balanchine Lives!'' on WNET (Channel 13 in New York) tomorrow at 7 p.m. and Tuesday at 1 a.m.</p>
        <p>Balanchine shrugged off the matter of his legacy. He redid dances and allowed performers to shape them individually. But with the creation of  the George Balanchine Trust, whose work has become a model for the licensing of dances, Balanchine's work had a head start on life after his death. Interviews with 14 former New York City Ballet and Balanchine-trained dancers, some of whom stage ballets for the trust and others who direct ballet companies throughout the United States and in Europe, suggest that the best method may still be the transmission of choreography through the memories and examples of those who worked directly with the creator.</p>
        <p>The blessedly straightforward ''Balanchine Lives!'' is crammed with photographs of the choreographer at work, looking much more poignantly human than the icon he is fast becoming. Balanchine's biographer Bernard Taper provides historical and social context. Another part of the rich mosaic are the personalities and observations of the re-stagers -- all women, curiously -- who painstakingly teach Balanchine to the dancers of the future.</p>
        <p>Karin von Aroldingen, one of the City Ballet performers to whom Balanchine left his ballets, is the eloquently poetic dreamer of the group. Patricia Neary jumps into the fray, a whirlwind on point in her late 50's. Francia Russell, co-director with Kent Stowell of Pacific Northwest Ballet, is tellingly pragmatic.</p>
        <p>Edward Villella, director of Miami City Ballet, mixes pragmatism with vivid recall of how it feels to dance Balanchine, and Patricia Wilde, then director of the Pittsburgh Ballet Theater, speaks movingly about a personal sense of legacy. Suzanne Farrell offers a remarkable insight into Balanchine's musicality.</p>
        <p>A surprising amount of information is woven into this thought-provoking and beautifully photographed hourlong documentary, edited by Julie Sloane and shot by Mark Trottenberg, Mead Hung and Reinhard Schatzman. Words and images convey not just the passing down of dance but also subjects ranging from Balanchine's respect for child performers to the ways his ballets help develop dancers and companies.</p>
        <p>Jean-Christophe Maillot, director of Les Ballets de Monte Carlo, sums it up. ''For every single choreographer, the day you give your step to another dancer you accept you're going to be betrayed by them,'' Mr. Maillot says, adding that what is important is what the dancer can do with that ''betrayal.''</p>
        <p>''If the choreographer is alive, good, he will give his own opinion,'' he said. ''If he's not alive, who knows, really, how 'Swan Lake' should have been danced?''</p>
