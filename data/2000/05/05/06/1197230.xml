        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''Invisible, Subtle Race Is On to Reach the Heights of No. 2'' (front page, May 3): Except for choosing a running mate, presidential candidates often dodge questions about appointments until they are elected.  Why shouldn't they name a few people they are considering for top cabinet posts? Besides helping voters, it might also serve the political interests of the candidates themselves.</p>
        <p>For example, Gov. George W. Bush and Vice President Al Gore both want to attract the independents who supported Senator John McCain. Why not ask Mr. McCain if he would be interested in serving as secretary of defense? He is passionate about improving the lot of the military.</p>

        <p>Arguably, voters also have a right to know who each of the two candidates is considering to head his economic team -- and the candidates might help their own causes by floating a few names.</p>
