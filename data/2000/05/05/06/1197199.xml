        <p>Irving S. Hamer Jr., the Manhattan member of the Board of Education, was barred yesterday by his colleagues on the board from his last-minute pursuit of the chancellorship of the New York City schools.</p>
        <p>But in response, Dr. Hamer told associates that he would continue to withhold his support from the current front-runner, Harold O. Levy, the interim chancellor, effectively paralyzing Mr. Levy's candidacy.</p>
        <p>The day of fast moving and often shifting events began as William C. Thompson Jr., the board president, told Dr. Hamer that he would not be allowed to join a list of six candidates selected by the board on Wednesday morning, because he had missed the deadline. Mr. Thompson said the board decided not to rethink its deadline because there was no consensus around Dr. Hamer's candidacy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thompson turned down Dr. Hamer's bid after consulting with  board members and finding that they were split, 3 to 3, on whether to reopen the nominating process, short of the 4 votes needed for an affirmative decision. Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's two appointees and the delegate from Staten Island favored allowing Dr. Hamer to be nominated, while Mr. Thompson and the delegates from Queens and the Bronx did not.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't me making a decision on my own,'' Mr. Thompson said yesterday. ''I was one of the other board members who expressed an opinion.''</p>
        <p>The chain of events put Mr. Thompson in the uncomfortable position of blocking the ambitions of a colleague he had worked harmoniously with for the last two years, while Mr. Giuliani's appointees -- who are philosophically opposed to Mr. Hamer on many issues -- were advocating his candidacy.</p>
        <p>But in a sign that the behind-the-scenes politicking was more byzantine than it might appear, Mr. Giuliani jumped into the fray for the first time yesterday, hinting that while he had had some differences with Mr. Levy, he did not rule out supporting him as permanent chancellor.</p>
        <p>The mayor said he had been disappointed by Mr. Levy's reluctance to push for individual merit pay for teachers, but suggested that now that the permanent job was no longer his for the asking, Mr. Levy might be more open to compromise.</p>
        <p>''I have an open mind,'' Mr. Giuliani said of Mr. Levy's candidacy. ''I haven't closed, closed my mind at all to Harold. And I don't know enough about Irving Hamer.''</p>
        <p>Asked if he would consider any other candidate for chancellor, Mr. Giuliani indicated that he would rather not. ''I can just focus on the two of them,'' the mayor said. ''I have an open mind with regard to the two of them.''</p>
        <p>The possibility that Mr. Levy might be open to compromise on merit pay clearly discomfited Randi Weingarten, president of the United Federation of Teachers, who aggressively pushed his selection as interim chancellor, over the opposition of Mr. Giuliani.</p>
        <p>''He is independent from the mayor, he's independent from us, he's a very independent man,'' Ms. Weingarten said. ''He's not going to go and take their position.''</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the mystery of why Dr. Hamer asked to be added to the list of candidates at the 11th hour, after headhunters had spent weeks compiling resumes, deepened yesterday. Confidants said Dr. Hamer, who had provided one of the four votes for Mr. Levy's selection as interim chancellor, was now dissatisfied with Mr. Levy's leadership, but they could not explain why. And for the second day in a row, Dr. Hamer avoided the media -- refusing to return telephone calls from reporters and turning down an invitation from the Manhattan borough president, C. Virginia Fields, to appear with her at a news conference on the latest developments in the chancellor search.</p>
        <p>Allies of Mr. Levy said he had agreed to seek the permanent chancellorship in mid-April only after four members of the board -- including Dr. Hamer -- assured him that he could count on their votes.</p>
        <p>But at her news conference yesterday, Ms. Fields said that the board president had been warned two or three weeks ago that Dr. Hamer's support for Mr. Levy was not a sure thing. She said she had spoken to Dr. Hamer yesterday, and he was still ''not prepared to vote for Harold Levy.''</p>
        <p>Asked if Dr. Hamer was maneuvering to become the next president of the board of education, Ms. Fields did not answer yes or no, saying, ''You can't believe all the things that have come up in the last 48 hours.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Levy's allies at the board were dismayed at the confusion Dr. Hamer's would-be candidacy had caused. ''The mayor is happy as hell,'' one board official said.</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Giuliani seemed both baffled and tickled by the turn of events. ''I think it's good that there's a debate,'' Mr. Giuliani said, referring to Dr. Hamer's bid. ''I don't know where I come out on it.''</p>
        <p>One possible outcome, education officials said, is that Mr. Levy could remain indefinitely as interim chancellor. Another is that Dr. Hamer will capitulate, throwing his vote behind Mr. Levy. ''In the end, there's no place else for him to go,'' one education official said.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the board released its list of six candidates for chancellor. Apart from Mr. Levy, all of them are notable mainly for their obscurity, and for the fact that they all come from outside New York City.</p>
        <p>The others are: Jerome Clark, chief of staff and vice president for institutional advancement at Bowie State University in Bowie, Md.; James P. Gallagher, president of Philadelphia University in Philadelphia, Pa.; Joan P. Kowal, former superintendent of schools for Palm Beach County, Fla.; Richard T. LaPointe, president and publisher of Laubach Literacy and New Readers Press in Syracuse, N.Y.; and Anthony J. Trujillo, director of district and school services and head of the America's Choice Program at the National Center on Education and the Economy.</p>
