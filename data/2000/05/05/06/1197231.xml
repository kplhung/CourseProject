        <p>Re '' 'Free' Music Can Free the Artist'' (Op-Ed, April 29), by Chuck D, about Napster, a Web site that helps people find, copy and share songs free of charge:</p>
        <p>I rarely listen to pop radio stations or watch MTV, but because Napster's software allows you to view the MP3 music files of all the other Napster users, I've been able to find music in like-minded listeners' collections I would otherwise not have been aware of. And I have recently  bought CD's by Macy Gray, Holly Cole and Alanis Morissette after discovering them through Napster.</p>

        <p>The fact that the music industry is fighting this technology reminds me of the words of Bob Dylan: ''Your old road is rapidly agin'. Please get out of the new one if you can't lend a hand, for the times they are a-changin'.''</p>
        <p>And, yes, Dylan is well represented on Napster, where he is being introduced to a new generation of fans.</p>
