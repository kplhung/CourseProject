        <p>America's oldest racing traditions surrounded 19 of the world's best 3-year-old thoroughbreds today on the eve of the 126th Kentucky Derby with its deep cast primed to answer the question: Is Fusaichi Pegasus a wonder horse, or will he be thwarted by the dense traffic in the race and the 150,000 clamorous fans watching it?</p>
        <p>One answer was ventured today by D. Wayne Lukas, who has entered three horses in the Derby and has won with four others, including Charismatic last year. He considered the twists of Derby fortunes, and said, ''It's just a matter of letting the race unfold.''</p>

        <p>America's oldest racing traditions surrounded 19 of the world's best 3-year-old thoroughbreds today on the eve of the 126th Kentucky Derby with its deep cast primed to answer the question: Is Fusaichi Pegasus a wonder horse, or will he be thwarted by the dense traffic in the race and the 150,000 clamorous fans watching it?</p>
        <p>One answer was ventured today by D. Wayne Lukas, who has entered three horses in the Derby and has won with four others, including Charismatic last year. He considered the twists of Derby fortunes, and said, ''It's just a matter of letting the race unfold.''</p>
        <p>He meant the uncertainties of racing a mile and a quarter with a field of 19 colts struggling to gain favorable position for the long drive down the homestretch, which measures 1,234 1/2 feet from the final turn to the finish line at Churchill Downs. And most of the field will be trying to catch Fusaichi Pegasus, the son of Mr. Prospector who was bought for $4 million as a yearling and comes into the Derby as either a superhorse or a potential victim of circumstances.</p>
        <p>''I think,'' Lukas added, ''too many times we get all caught up in strategy, and these Hollywood scripts don't play out. Sometimes when you've got good players, it is better not to coach them.''</p>
        <p>The weather was mild, almost summery, and the track was fast as Derby Day neared. Most racing analysts seemed to agree that this was the most tightly matched bunch of horses in years: it includes champions from the United States, Britain and the Middle East. But the favorite was still Fusaichi Pegasus, owned by the Japanese venture capitalist Fusao Sekiguchi, who arrived at his horse's Barn 41 this morning while his trainer, Neil Drysdale, was sending the colt through a trot of a mile and a quarter followed by a gallop of a mile and a quarter.</p>
        <p>Drysdale, an Englishman who was elected to racing's Hall of Fame this week, continued to protect his star against the growing furor at Churchill Downs as well as the warming weather. Aside from the fact that no favorite has won since Spectacular Bid in 1979, Drysdale's chief problem seemed to be the balky temperament of Fusaichi Pegasus, who might be inflamed by both the weather and the clamor. In fact, Drysdale said his last-minute training plans for introducing his horses to the outdoor paddock would be influenced by the heat of the day.</p>
        <p>''It's going to depend on the weather,'' he said. ''It was pretty sticky yesterday.''</p>
        <p>At Barn 42 next door, Todd Pletcher sent his fleet of four Derby horses through their final dress rehearsals of about a mile and a quarter, then said, ''They're all doing great.'' Pletcher, 36, a former assistant to Lukas, was asked whether his speed horse More Than Ready could last 10 furlongs one month after he ran nine in the Blue Grass and lost to High Yield by a head.</p>
        <p>''I was questioned about his ability to go a mile and an eighth before the Blue Grass,'' he replied. ''And now, of course, his ability to go 10 furlongs is in question. Then the Belmont is 12 furlongs, and that will be a question, too. But anyone who says they know their horse can go that far is kidding themselves.''</p>
        <p>Each horse in the race will move one stall to the inside because of the withdrawal of Globalize, first in the Turfway Park Spiral and second in Keeneland's Lexington. The horse was scratched after he was kicked by his stable pony while leaving the track Thursday after exercising. He had held the No. 1 post position, which now goes to last year's juvenile champion, Anees.</p>
        <p>The Deputy, winner of the Santa Anita Derby, will move from his No. 11 slot to No. 10, but will still be loaded in the gate first with Anees. Under the double-loading system, Nos. 1 and 10 are loaded at the same time, then No. 2 (Aptitude) and No. 11 (China Visit).</p>
        <p>The Deputy was galloped a mile and a quarter this morning for his final exercise, and will not go to the track the day of the race, according to his trainer, Jenine Sahadi. She is the 10th woman to saddle a Derby starter and probably has the best chance so far of becoming the first to win. Shelly Riley finished second with Casual Lies in 1992.</p>
        <p>The international flavor of the Derby will be upheld by China Visit and Curule, both owned by Sheik Mohammed al-Maktoum of Dubai, who watched his colts cantering this morning. He was asked about the fact that China Visit had only two races on his record, and Curule four. But he repeated his abiding interest in winning the Kentucky Derby, and said: ''We can win from Dubai, and we will do it. From my home, which is 2 kilometers from the training center, I can see my horses. I can't do that if they are over here.''</p>
        <p>Bob Baffert, who won the Derby in 1997 with Silver Charm and in 1998 with Real Quiet, was conceded a good shot this year with Captain Steve. The colt, who has shined in his workouts at Churchill Downs, galloped a mile and three-eighths today.</p>
        <p>Bobby Frankel, who trains Aptitude, third in the Wood Memorial, was asked if he had scouted any of his rivals who looked sharp, and he replied, ''The favorite and Captain Steve.''</p>
