        <p>Correction of May 5 article on Boston Herald's suspension of consumer affairs columnist, Robin Washington; Washington did not say he thinks he was suspended because of pressure from bank whose practices he criticized in his columns</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>An article yesterday about the Boston Herald's suspension of a consumer affairs columnist, Robin Washington, misstated his account of the cause. Mr. Washington has said publicly that he believes he was originally demoted after a bank, the FleetBoston Financial Corporation, complained about his columns on its fee structure. He said he was then suspended after asserting publicly that the bank influenced coverage.  He did not say he believed he was suspended because of pressure from the bank.</p>
