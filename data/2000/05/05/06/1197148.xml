        <p>The air was filled with laughter and affection when dancers, choreographers and students gathered to pay homage to Joan Miller last Saturday at the Dicapo Theater in a celebration of her 30 years in dance.  Ms. Miller is one of those quiet teachers and artists who have brought extra vitality and vision to New York dance. For more than three decades she has nourished careers as director of the dance program at Lehman College, where Joan Miller's Dance Players is a resident company.</p>
        <p>Ms. Miller's aesthetic was formed through work with leading figures in ballet and modern and avant-garde dance in New York. One mentor was Jose Limon, to whom her new ''Ole Jose'' is dedicated. Anyone expecting the dour-sounding icon of legend is in for a disappointment.</p>

        <p>The air was filled with laughter and affection when dancers, choreographers and students gathered to pay homage to Joan Miller last Saturday at the Dicapo Theater in a celebration of her 30 years in dance.  Ms. Miller is one of those quiet teachers and artists who have brought extra vitality and vision to New York dance. For more than three decades she has nourished careers as director of the dance program at Lehman College, where Joan Miller's Dance Players is a resident company.</p>
        <p>Ms. Miller's aesthetic was formed through work with leading figures in ballet and modern and avant-garde dance in New York. One mentor was Jose Limon, to whom her new ''Ole Jose'' is dedicated. Anyone expecting the dour-sounding icon of legend is in for a disappointment.</p>
        <p>Ms. Miller's Limon is a quizzical, sweet-spirited everyday patriarch here, first observed nibbling meditatively on green grapes. His six performers, led by Tyrone Monroe, take over in a hurtling, circling dance that recalls the choreographer at his most joyous. The Limon figure returns, sharing his grapes, then tossing them into the air.</p>
        <p>Limon was played by Martial Roumain, the troupe's new director and a longtime performer of warmth and resonance. The cast included Sandy Alvarez, Maki Fujita, Thomas Krever, Johari Mayfield and Nanako Tsukiyama. ''Ole Jose'' is set to music by composers including Norman  Hedman, Gwendolyn Watson, Carlos Surinach and Steve Reich.</p>
        <p>The program was otherwise a retrospective, with signature moments of equability, passion and untidiness.</p>
