        <p>The police officers who searched the scenes of the crash of Pan Am 103 in 1988 began taking the stand today in the trial of two Libyans accused of blowing up the plane.</p>
        <p>The testimony was drier than that of the first two days, when air traffic controllers described the flight's winking off their radar screens, and neighbors described the hailstorm of fire, metal and bodies that fell on their roofs and gardens in Scotland.</p>
        <p>If the day's testimony was more about the grim minutiae of police work in the confusion of a crime scene covering 850 square miles, it was also testimony that let the defense tip its hand a bit more.</p>
        <p>Defense lawyers tried to get witnesses to say that C.I.A. and F.B.I. agents were tramping the moors, with opportunities aplenty to plant or steal evidence.</p>
        <p>They did get testimony that the Scottish police believed for more than a year that Palestinians had bombed the London-to-New York flight, which fell out of the skies on the small town of Lockerbie, killing the 259 people on the plane and 11 on the ground.</p>
        <p>The day ended with a reading of the names of the victims, by families when applicable, with their addresses and the ages of those under 21. Audience members wept quietly as a speaker buzzed faintly with the noise of the list being repeated in Arabic. Two older women sobbed when the prosecutor reached the Owens family, killed with their daughters, and a young woman employed by the Scottish government slipped down the aisle with a box of tissues, patting their arms. Others reached across the seats to comfort one another.</p>
        <p>''Many of the relatives have become close friends,'' Jim Swire, a Briton who lost a daughter on the flight, said afterward. ''And all I can say is that that's one of the few good things that have come out of this.''</p>
        <p>The testimony elicited by the prosecution from seven officers who directed the searches of various sectors seemed intended to leave the image of a vast but precise operation. Pictures were displayed of long rows of searchers combing fields while helicopters flew grid patterns overhead.</p>
        <p>The first sweeps were for bodies, they said, and then it was done over again, sometimes in driving rain, for debris. Items as small as watches were logged. At one point, said former Chief Inspector Alexander McLean, tarpaulins had to be brought in because the cargo included a million sewing machine needles, and two officers had been pricked.</p>
        <p>The defense cross-examined six of the seven officers, mostly looking for details about Americans on the scene.</p>
        <p>There are almost as many published theories about Pan Am 103 as about the Kennedy assassinations.</p>
        <p>One published in Britain held that it was a sting by the United States Drug Enforcement Administration that went wrong when someone swapped a bomb for a heroin package.</p>
        <p>Because two Central Intelligence Agency employees are believed to have died in the crash, agency personnel were on the scene, officers testified today. Scenarios blaming the C.I.A. have circulated.</p>
        <p>More widely believed was the theory that American and Scottish investigators worked with until 1991: that the plane was bombed by Syrian-backed Palestinians working for Iran, which was seeking revenge for the downing of an Iranian passenger jet by an American warship in July 1988.</p>
        <p>That had plausibility because in October 1988, two months before the plane went down, the West German police arrested a dozen Palestinians with Syrian passports, a Toshiba boom box, detonators, barometric fuses, a bazooka and other arms.</p>
        <p>But most of them, including a known bomb-maker named Marwan Khreesat, were released by a German judge and disappeared. Later, the Germans found three more bombs packed in Toshibas, one of which killed the man dismantling it.</p>
        <p>The Palestinian groups have repeatedly denied blowing up Pan Am 103.</p>
        <p>Investigators changed their minds about them after finding bits of a timer embedded in a charred shirt in the debris. The timer was traced to a Swiss company that is said to have identified its customer as the Libyan government, although it later said it had sold the timers to others too and had lost some in a burglary.</p>
        <p>On Wednesday, the defense announced its intention, as required by Scottish law, that it would blame another party, the Palestinians. As the defense, it need not prove that to win; it must only raise doubts in the judges' minds about the prosecution's case. Presumably, the defense plans to suggest that the Libyan-connected timer was planted by American investigators.</p>
        <p>In his testimony for the prosecution, former Deputy Chief Inspector Andrew D. Jackson described his sector search. Then the defense asked him about six months he spent in Washington in 1989 as a liaison officer with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. He acknowledged that the bureau then believed the Palestinians guilty and that he had purchased and brought home two Toshiba boom boxes for Scottish investigators.</p>
        <p>Chief Inspector McLean, on cross-examination, expressed surprise that foreign investigators suggested which items of debris might be interesting, but he appeared confused about differences between the F.B.I. and the C.I.A., which he twice called the ''Criminal Intelligence Agency.''</p>
        <p>And in his prosecution testimony, former Chief Inspector Norman Brown described how he had tagged and recorded tons of evidence. On cross-examination, he was pressed to admit that rows of large plastic evidence bags stood open and unguarded on a park lawn.</p>
        <p>Then the defense lawyer, William Taylor, asked, ''This debris was collected by police officers?''</p>
        <p>''Yes, sir.''</p>
        <p>''Fire personnel?''</p>
        <p>''Yes, sir.''</p>
        <p>''R.A.F. volunteers?''</p>
        <p>''Yes, sir.''</p>
        <p>''Army personnel?''</p>
        <p>''Yes, sir.''</p>
        <p>''American personnel?''</p>
        <p>There was a long pause.</p>
        <p>Finally Inspector Brown said, ''I don't remember any American personnel in Sector B, sir.''</p>
