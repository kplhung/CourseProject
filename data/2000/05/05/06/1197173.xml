        <p>A day after tightening press censorship in the interests of national security, the government said in an official press release today that troops had pushed back Tamil rebels who were trying to capture the northern city of Jaffna, the cultural capital of the minority Tamils.</p>
        <p>But as they issued the release, officials also deleted portions of reports by international news agencies that described an opposition rally organized by the United National Party to protest the authorities' sweeping new powers.</p>
        <p>''I consider this an issue of national security,'' said the chief censor, Ariya Rubasinghe, director of information. ''We can't afford to have commotions or civil disturbances.''</p>
        <p>The regulations announced on Thursday let the government censor articles by foreign reporters and close Sri Lankan newspapers that defy censorship rules. Before, local journalists who ignored the censor received written warnings. The government can also seize private property and prohibit strikes, political rallies and criticism of President Chandrika Kumaratunga if it believes that is necessary for security.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rubasinghe said that although the regulations allowed censoring criticism of Ms. Kumaratunga, ''we won't enforce it seriously.''</p>
        <p>Since last month, the government has been in a pitched battle with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, a group that has been fighting for a separate homeland for the Hindu Tamil minority since 1983 and that the United States has included on its list of terrorist organizations.</p>
        <p>Since April 22, the rebels have taken control of two military bases in the Tamil-dominated north in a push to regain Jaffna, which the government recaptured five years ago. The majority of this island nation of 18 million is Sinhalese and Buddhist.</p>
        <p>The press release issued by Mr. Rubasinghe today said the government had strengthened its position since April 22, when it pulled out of its sprawling military base at Elephant Pass, which the Tigers now occupy.</p>
        <p>''Continuous attacks by the troops caused the terrorists to flee southward with their casualties,'' the release said. ''All troops in Jaffna Peninsula are determined to push back the terrorists. Due to confrontations on 3rd and 4th of May, terrorists are in a state of disarray. However, the terrorists continued to fire mortars at the troops.''</p>
        <p>The government said two soldiers were killed today and one was wounded. It added that life continued normally in Jaffna, with government offices and schools functioning. The government said it was providing ''ample food'' to residents who needed the help.</p>
        <p>It was not possible to assess the contents of the release, because no reporters have been allowed to go to the battle front or to Jaffna, and telephone communications to the peninsula have been disrupted.</p>
        <p>Members of the United National Party held a rally here today in Independence Square to protest the new regulations, including those that censor foreign press accounts, saying they infringed on civil liberties.</p>
