        <p>In a decision that could affect all  drivers in New York State, a federal judge in Manhattan ruled this week that state regulators could not prevent two insurance companies from recommending specific auto repair shops to their policyholders.</p>
        <p>The ruling, filed yesterday in United States District Court, involves a state law prohibiting insurance companies from providing lists of repair shops unless customers specifically ask for a recommendation. In his decision, issued Thursday, Judge Richard C. Casey found that the law violated the companies' constitutional right to free speech.</p>
        <p>Although Judge Casey's decision was written to apply to the two companies that had sued the state, Allstate and Geico, an industry trade group said the decision would probably apply to all insurers that write policies in New York State.</p>
        <p>''The decision should be interpreted broadly, not just for Allstate and Geico,'' said Robert P. Hartwig, chief economist for the Insurance Information Institute, the industry group.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hartwig said insurers' repair policies were basically the same. He said the companies wanted to be able to recommend repair shops that provided cheap and reliable service to minimize their costs.</p>
        <p>The lawyer who represented the State Insurance Department in the case said he had not had time to review the judge's ruling and could not say whether the state would appeal, or whether the ruling would affect other insurance companies.</p>
        <p>The law prohibiting referrals, enacted in 1974, was intended to protect consumers' ability to choose their own repair shop. It was amended in 1983 to allow insurance companies to recommend auto glass repair shops, although the change was not extended to general repairs. The judge said the Insurance Department approved the 1983 amendment in expectation that it would result in lower claim costs and premiums.</p>
        <p>The state law also prohibits insurance companies from requiring policyholders to use certain shops. Geico and Allstate did not challenge that part of the law.</p>
        <p>Allstate writes the most auto insurance policies in New York State, insuring 1.6 million cars, or 20 percent of the market, according to the Insurance Department. Geico insures about 7 percent of the market, or 560,000 cars.</p>
        <p>The conflict began in 1992, after state regulators threatened to fine Allstate for posting a sign at offices  informing customers: ''If you have no shop preference, your adjuster is prepared to recommend several conveniently located repair shops.''</p>
        <p>Regulators said the sign, erected as part of a company program to evaluate approved repair shops, violated the prohibition on recommending shops to policyholders.</p>
        <p>But Judge Casey found that policyholders were not denied the ability to select their own repair shops. He also said the state law deprived customers of important information by barring insurance companies from telling their customers which shops had a proven track record.</p>
        <p>''Although the state does have a legitimate interest in protecting consumers,'' he wrote, ''the court does not accept the notion that consumers' lack of intelligence requires the state to deprive them of options or limit their choices to those which the state thinks are acceptable. The court finds that the programs offered to Allstate's and Geico's insureds afford them additional opportunities, protection and truthful information. The speech at issue is not deceptive, misleading or illegal.''</p>
        <p>Bruce E. Clark, a lawyer for Allstate, said the company was ''gratified'' by the decision, but he declined to comment further until he had reviewed the ruling.</p>
