        <p>The British and Irish governments announced late Friday night that they had agreed on a new formula to restart the suspended power-sharing government in Belfast this month and urged Ulster's Roman Catholic and Protestant leaders to endorse it.</p>
        <p>The new plan envisages resumption on May 22 of the government that was suspended in February, after only eight weeks of activity. And it sets a new date of June 2001 for putting in place all the steps of the flagging Northern Ireland peace accord.</p>
        <p>The surprise announcement followed 30 hours of negotiations by Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, with the Northern Ireland political leaders at Hillsborough Castle outside Belfast. It was made at a moment when there appeared scant hope of a breakthrough in the impasse over disarmament that has continually blocked progress.</p>
        <p>May 22 is the date set out in the April 1998 accord by which all disarmament by Northern Ireland's paramilitary groups was to have been accomplished, and although that possibility has faded, the date has taken on the symbolism of a deadline by which there has to be some progress to avert a total collapse of the peace accord.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair and Mr. Ahern met last week in London and this week for two days in Belfast under increasing pressure to produce something to keep alive the settlement that had raised hopes of an end to 30 years of sectarian violence that has cost more than 3,600 lives.</p>
        <p>The details of the new blueprint were not made public. But an eight-point statement issued just before midnight on Friday indicated that the governments had dropped the demand for disarmament itself, long the barrier to progress in putting the settlement into place, and were instead looking for a declaration from the Irish Republican Army and Protestant paramilitary groups that would rule out any future resort to violence.</p>
        <p>''With confidence that there are clear proposals for implementing all other aspects of the agreement, the governments believe that paramilitary organizations must now, for their part, urgently state clearly that they will put their arms completely and verifiably beyond use,'' the statement said.</p>
        <p>Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the predominantly Catholic Irish Republican Army, has in recent weeks discouraged hope of any such declaration from the I.R.A. But in comments early today, he sounded more conciliatory.</p>
        <p>When Britain suspended the home-rule government on Feb. 11, it said it was taking the action because the I.R.A. had failed to make expected moves on disarmament. Since then, Sinn Fein has been adamant that Britain bears the sole responsibility for getting the government up and running again.</p>
        <p>Signaling a possible change in attitude this morning, Mr. Adams said, ''This is a decisive moment,'' and he called on everyone supporting the peace accord to ''rally behind this initiative.''</p>
        <p>Suggesting what he had been able to extract as grounds for moving forward, Mr. Adams said his people would ''particularly welcome commitments on human rights and equality, demilitarization, the Irish language and support for the families of all the victims of conflict.''</p>
        <p>There was no immediate reaction from the Ulster Unionists, the province's main Protestant party. But its leader, David Trimble, has suggested for the last two months that he may be willing to enter government with Sinn Fein if it had ironclad assurances that violence was at an end.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trimble's party is divided over disarmament, with a substantial minority demanding that there be an actual turnover of weapons before members agree to sit in the government with Sinn Fein members. Mr. Trimble overcame that opposition in November and took his party into the government. But when the I.R.A. failed to make the weapons moves expected in early February, his leadership was threatened.</p>
        <p>The British, who consider Mr. Trimble the essential person on the Protestant side in the peace talks, then suspended the government.</p>
        <p>Mr. Blair and Mr. Ahern said they could not force the Protestant politicians to resume sharing power with Sinn Fein. But Mr. Blair, with Mr. Ahern at his side, said, ''It's now incumbent upon the parties and, perhaps in particular, the paramilitary organizations to give their response to the proposals we've made.</p>
        <p>''I very much hope that that response is positive. And in particular that we can make sure that the arms issue is dealt with completely and verifiably.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Ahern, considered the principal interlocutor with Sinn Fein and its I.R.A. allies, added, ''I'd be very disappointed if the response from the paramilitaries was not extremely positive.''</p>
