        <p>Free of the illness that sapped his energy and ultimately his life, Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor's body was returned to St. Patrick's Cathedral yesterday, beginning a final farewell to the eloquent, unswerving archbishop of New York from the millions of Roman Catholics he led.</p>
        <p>The cathedral's great double doors were thrown open for the arrival precisely at 4 p.m., as a solemn procession of seminarians, priests, nuns and auxiliary bishops, led by altar boys bearing the archbishopric cross, marched toward the mahogany coffin that held the cardinal's body, accompanied by his family, including his three siblings, Thomas O'Connor, Dorothy Hamilton and Mary Ward.</p>

        <p>Free of the illness that sapped his energy and ultimately his life, Cardinal John Joseph O'Connor's body was returned to St. Patrick's Cathedral yesterday, beginning a final farewell to the eloquent, unswerving archbishop of New York from the millions of Roman Catholics he led.</p>
        <p>The cathedral's great double doors were thrown open for the arrival precisely at 4 p.m., as a solemn procession of seminarians, priests, nuns and auxiliary bishops, led by altar boys bearing the archbishopric cross, marched toward the mahogany coffin that held the cardinal's body, accompanied by his family, including his three siblings, Thomas O'Connor, Dorothy Hamilton and Mary Ward.</p>
        <p>Sweet incense floated over the coffin and rose toward the heavens, as the faithful believe the cardinal's soul now does. In a greeting, Bishop Patrick J. Sheridan, the cardinal's vicar general who had been his right-hand man, sprinkled holy water over the bier of his friend of many years and then covered it with a white funeral pall -- both acts reminiscent of baptism.</p>
        <p>Knowing death was near, the cardinal had said his formal goodbyes several times since he underwent surgery for a brain tumor last August: in a note to his fellow bishops last fall, when he visited the pope in February, and in a letter to the 875 or so priests of his archdiocese the same month.</p>
        <p>But those messages seemed powerless to counter the quiet grief as the cardinal's coffin glided past the pews for the last time, carried on the shoulders of sad-eyed men wearing dark gray gloves.</p>
        <p>The mourners in the pews sang a processional hymn as they watched the cardinal's coffin move past them. ''He who is throned in heaven, takes up his dwelling place,'' they sang. ''No sound is heard of weeping, for pain and sorrow cease. And sin shall reign no longer, but love and joy and peace.''</p>
        <p>Edith McGowan, 80, prayed the rosary as she waited in the pews, and said she felt the sadness well inside her throughout the half-hour ceremony. ''He was such a beautiful man,'' said Mrs. McGowan, who met the cardinal last year. ''So gentle speaking.''</p>
        <p>Agnes Ohuche, 28, from Harlem, was sitting in one of the last pews, a black lace scarf falling over her face. She prayed for mercy for Cardinal O'Connor as his soul reached judgment. ''I'm grateful to God for all the things the cardinal has done for us,'' she said. ''He was a strong defender of the Holy Father.''</p>
        <p>In his homily, Bishop Sheridan spoke of Cardinal O'Connor as not only his bishop, but as ''my brother and my friend.'' He said next door to the cardinal's spare bedroom in his Madison Avenue residence was a small private chapel. And on the other side of the chapel was Bishop Sheridan's room. He said the two men often joked that, ''The only one who ever came between us was Jesus Christ.''</p>
        <p>Wherever Cardinal O'Connor's far-flung travels took him, Bishop Sheridan added, the cardinal always made sure to come home by Saturday night, so he could celebrate the 10:15 Mass at St. Patrick's the following morning. ''His work is done, and now he is home,'' he said.</p>
        <p>As pallbearers removed the top of the cardinal's coffin to begin the public viewing, those in the pews sang ''Morning Has Broken,'' a hymn to earth's capacity for renewal and rebirth, made famous by Cat Stevens. The cardinal had specifically requested the song at the moment New Yorkers would encounter his body for the first time.</p>
        <p>By the time the music had ended, the cardinal could be seen dressed as he would be if he were about to celebrate Mass.</p>
        <p>He wore the scarlet cassock of the cardinal, covered by a white flowing gown, or alb. Over his alb was the cardinal's chasuble, and flowing in a line down the front and back of the chasuble was his white woolen pallium, the symbol of his archbishop's office. Around his neck, the cardinal wore a stole, the symbol of the priesthood, and the pectoral archbishopric cross, with its double crossbeams. In his hands he clasped a rosary.</p>
        <p>''If I go and prepare a place for you, I will come back again and take you to myself, so that where I am you also may be,'' Joseph McLafferty, a soon-to-be ordained priest, read from the Gospel According to John. ''Where I am going, you know the way.''</p>
        <p>After the bishops, senior priests, and nuns filed before the cardinal's coffin, it was the turn of the lay people, who had come from throughout the New York area to pray and grieve at the cathedral, which felt oddly intimate in sadness, despite its size.</p>
        <p>Stella La Coppola, 65, a native of Puerto Rico who lives in Queens Village, wept as she looked at the cardinal. ''He took care of everybody, no matter who you were -- the poor, the sick, no matter what nationality, where you were, what color,'' she said. ''He was a good man to us. And I'm going to miss him.''</p>
        <p>In the evening began the first of many special Masses scheduled between now and the cardinal's funeral at 2 p.m. on Monday. This one, presided over by the cardinal's friend and former secretary, Auxiliary Bishop James McCarthy, was for the Knights of Columbus, the Knights and Dames of the Order of Malta, and the Knights and Ladies of the Holy Sepulchre.</p>
        <p>Also holding a place of honor at last night's Mass were the Sisters of Life, an order founded by the cardinal that works to eliminate abortion and euthanasia, by running shelters for unwed mothers and visiting the sick and elderly.</p>
        <p>Bishop McCarthy spoke of Cardinal O'Connor's life as a reflection of his faith. He praised the cardinal's efforts, after a rocky start in New York, to build strong ties between Catholics and Jews. ''Have our brothers and sisters of Abraham, the Jews, ever had such a strong Catholic supporter?'' Bishop McCarthy asked.</p>
        <p>He noted that many disagreed with Cardinal O'Connor's unwavering opposition to abortion and his strict adherence to the church's position on contraception and sexuality.</p>
        <p>''He treated critics with great respect,'' Bishop McCarthy said. ''How many times did we see him slapped in the face only to turn the other cheek?''</p>
        <p>And, since the subject was Cardinal O'Connor, his friend could not help but speak of his sense of humor. He said he remembered sitting next to Cardinal O'Connor during a priest's funeral, when the cardinal said he wanted Bishop McCarthy to speak at services after he died, as well.</p>
        <p>Not that it was a license to upstage the cardinal. ''If you go on too long,'' Bishop McCarthy remembered him saying, ''I'll get out of the casket and turn off the mike.''</p>
        <p>Bishop McCarthy said that many people these days were asking about the cardinal's legacy. ''I would say, 'He saved lives,' '' Bishop McCarthy said of his friend. ''He saved lives and allowed God to save souls.''</p>
