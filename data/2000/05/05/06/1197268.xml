        <p>Holdsclaw said she was anxious to return to training camp even though the two stress fractures in her foot prevented her from working out with the team, which opened training camp on Wednesday.</p>
        <p>It's coming along, she said. I've been able to run, but I won't be able to have full contact until next Monday.</p>
