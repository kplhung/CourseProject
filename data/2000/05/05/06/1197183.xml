        <p>Following are excerpts from the prepared text of a speech about education that Vice President Al Gore delivered yesterday to the teachers union in Lansing, Mich., as provided by Mr. Gore's campaign:</p>
        <p>Think about it: we're asking America's teachers to meet our greatest obligation for the future. We're asking them to educate and help mold our children. Yet we pay them far less than other professionals with essentially the same qualifications are now earning. And that is wrong.</p>

        <p>Following are excerpts from the prepared text of a speech about education that Vice President Al Gore delivered yesterday to the teachers union in Lansing, Mich., as provided by Mr. Gore's campaign:</p>
        <p>Think about it: we're asking America's teachers to meet our greatest obligation for the future. We're asking them to educate and help mold our children. Yet we pay them far less than other professionals with essentially the same qualifications are now earning. And that is wrong.</p>
        <p>In communities where schools, teachers, community groups, and local businesses agree on effective plans to raise teacher quality, let's give every qualified teacher a $5,000 raise.</p>
        <p>Let's give $10,000 raises to master teachers, and those who become certified by the National Board for Professional Teaching Standards.</p>
        <p>Let's reward all teachers in schools where the entire school meets agreed-upon performance goals, which include higher student achievement. Let's work with teachers and administrators to develop plans that reward individual teachers. And based on the innovative plan negotiated and partly designed by teachers in Denver, I believe we should ask teachers to help us find proper ways to integrate gains in student performance with the other criteria that should be used for rewarding excellence in teaching.</p>
        <p>The simple fact is that raising teacher salaries and rewarding excellence is essential to the third challenge I want to discuss:  making sure that all teachers have the professional development and support they need to meet higher standards.</p>
        <p>If I'm entrusted with the presidency, I will require states to guarantee that all teachers are fully certified or working toward certification and that all middle school and high school teachers have a major, a minor, or demonstrated ability in the subject they teach. . . . Right now, one quarter of all high school teachers don't have even a minor in the subject they teach.</p>
        <p>So I will combine greater accountability with greater investment, building on our recent $1 billion national commitment to intensive professional development for America's teachers. . . .</p>
        <p>I believe all new teachers should have to pass a rigorous and fair assessment, which includes tests in the subjects they will teach, before they set foot in the classroom. We should test new elementary school teachers, to make sure they are prepared to teach the crucial subject of reading, as part of a national crusade to ensure that every child can read independently and well by the end of the third grade. And I believe states should be required to conduct these tests as a condition for receiving federal funding. . . .</p>
        <p>I urge faster but fair ways, within due process, to identify, help and, when necessary, speedily remove low-performing teachers. While we know the vast majority of teachers are doing a good job, we know there are a few who are not. And we know that they unfairly reflect on all those who are. That means that while we absolutely must respect due process, we have to put an end to endless delays in removing those teachers who really need to be removed.</p>
        <p>We should also empower principals, with the active participation and advice of teams of teachers, to hire their own staffs, based on expertise and support for the school's academic mission, and not solely on seniority.  And we should empower principals, with the participation of teachers, to manage their own budgets.</p>
        <p>At its best, teaching is a lifetime vocation.  But no teaching license or contract should be a lifetime job guarantee. And let me be clear: we have to give all our teachers the support and training they need to succeed.</p>
