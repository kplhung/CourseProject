        <p>St. Catherine's Street, this city's fabled entertainment and shopping artery, used to boast the highest rents in Canada. But 25 years ago, after separatist governments mandated French supremacy in commercial signs, English-speakers sourly noted that the most common sign on the street was ''A louer'' -- ''For Rent.''</p>
        <p>But now Rue Ste. Catherine has a new face. Vacant storefronts have been filled with high-fashion boutiques, restaurants and ''exotic dancing'' clubs that are attracting crowds that spill off sidewalks into the street. At one end, the old hockey rink is being transformed into a multimedia entertainment center with 5,000 movie theater seats. At another end, the old Loews Theater is to reopen next year as entertainment salad of circus stages, restaurants and night clubs, the second Club Med World after Paris's.</p>
        <p>Montreal is coming back after years of fray and decay. Once the eastern shipping hub of the country, it has reinvented itself as a center for biotech, telecommunications and information technology companies. Rents are rising along with construction cranes, tourists are packing hotels, and this city of 3.3 million people has become the third most popular site in North America for conventions.</p>
        <p>''While Toronto is still No. 1, the pendulum is swinging back to Montreal,'' Gillian Cosgrove, a business writer, lamented recently in The National Post, a newspaper edited in a city stuck with such labels as ''Toronto the Good'' and ''Toronto the Clean.'' The rivalry between Montreal, the fun center, and Toronto, the financial center, compares to the rivalries between Rome and Milan, or between Rio and Sao Paulo.</p>
        <p>For the first time anyone can remember, Montreal's unemployment rate has dipped below Toronto's, hitting 6.5 percent in January, the lowest level in a quarter-century. Quebec province registered 4 percent economic growth last year, higher than the rest of Canada for the first time in more than a decade. While poverty still blights many communities, Quebec's welfare rolls have dropped by about a quarter in the last five years.</p>
        <p>Where once construction cranes were an endangered species, more than a billion dollars' worth of construction is under way. The convention center is being doubled, and the downtown airport is expanding. Near the river, workers are finishing Cite Multimedia, a huge incubator for high-tech start-up companies. Later this summer, work is to begin downtown on a new $150 million baseball stadium for the Expos.</p>
        <p>''We are shooting to get the shovels in by June,'' said Stephen Bronfman, the 36-year-old co-chairman of the Expos, who is member of the wealthy Bronfman clan.</p>
        <p>Last summer, Montreal hotels enjoyed their best occupancy rates since Expo '67, the world's fair 33 years ago that marked the city's last economic boom.</p>
        <p>''We call it 'Paris without jet lag,' '' said Marie-Josee Allaire, spokeswoman for the Ritz Carlton Montreal, one of several Montreal hotels that have spent a total of $150 million for renovations.</p>
        <p>The floods of New Englanders and New Yorkers booking rooms in Montreal this summer follows a 20 percent jump in foreign tourism that Canada has enjoyed for two years. As airlines add new flights this year between the United States and Montreal, the tourist boom is partly built on bargains to be had with the weak Canadian currency, which trades at almost 1.50 for one American dollar.</p>
        <p>Montreal has also reinvented itself as a major center for higher education. The city now edges out Boston for the highest percentage of college students in North America's largest cities.</p>
        <p>''Our goal to is to have 25 percent of our students coming from outside of Canada,'' said Bernard J. Shapiro, principal of McGill University, which is the largest predominantly English-language school in Montreal.</p>
        <p>To encourage French-speaking bonds, a student from Senegal, where France was the colonial power, often pays less state tuition  to study in Montreal than a student from neighboring, English-speaking Ontario.</p>
        <p>This concentration of brain power has helped to move Montreal away from its old industrial base into a mix of biopharmaceutical companies and other technology-based concerns. In Montreal's suburbs, the shift can be most visible at ''pill hill,'' where 40 percent of Canada's pharmaceutical companies are based. Bombardier, a Montreal company that many Americans associate with snowmobiles, has become the world's third largest aircraft manufacturer.</p>
        <p>''The new economy is multimedia; we are No. 1 in research and development,'' Montreal's mayor, Pierre Bourque, said recently in an interview. Reflecting the economic dynamism here, the Quebec government and the Nasdaq announced plans a week ago to open Nasdaq Canada this fall. The new electronic exchange would return company stock trading to the city after the Montreal Stock Exchange closed last year.</p>
        <p>Spending by American filmmakers has also been a source of economic growth, jumping fourfold in the last five years to $200 million a year. American directors have discovered that this gracefully aging city with its stately churches and quaint public squares offers discount locations that can pass for European or American.</p>
        <p>Attracting American start-up companies is the fact that electricity, office rents and industrial construction costs are about half those of New York and Boston. The downside is that Quebec has North America's highest income tax rates; combined federal and provincial rates top out at 51.7 percent.</p>
        <p>''The rents are extremely cheap relative to the horror stories I've heard about Manhattan,'' said David E. Pawsey, a 24-year-old digital editor. ''You can get a three-bedroom place downtown for $800'' -- the equivalent of $550 American -- ''and that's considered expensive.''</p>
        <p>With free trade, Quebec is increasingly oriented south, expanding the part of its economy devoted to trade with the United States to 25 percent today, from 10 percent a decade ago. If Quebec were a nation, it would now be the United States' fifth largest trading partner.</p>
        <p>''Montreal is losing Canada as its hinterland and focusing on the U.S.,'' said Raphael Fischler, a Belgian immigrant who teaches urban planning at McGill. ''The francophones have reconquered Montreal. Now, the great tension in Quebec is between linguistic nationalism and economic globalization.''</p>
        <p>Although red and white maple leaf flags generally fly only over federally owned buildings here, separatist passions and linguistic tensions seem increasingly relaxed. In the last vote on Quebec separation from Canada, in 1995, the separatists narrowly lost.</p>
        <p>After the French-supremacy language laws were imposed, about 40 percent of Montreal's English-speaking population decamped for Ontario and points west. Those remaining are more culturally and linguistically supple. The Gazette, the city's English-language newspaper, recently published a series on ''the new Anglos,'' noting that in one generation, the percentage of bilingual English-speaking residents had doubled, to about two-thirds today. While ethnic politicians often demonize the other group, bicultural marriages now outnumber marriages between two English-speakers.</p>
        <p>While English-speakers in Montreal may sometimes feel beleaguered, there is no sign that the English presence is going to disappear here. Indeed, in one of the biggest investments in the Canadian newspaper world this year, The Gazette plans to inaugurate a $50 million, full color printing press in October.</p>
        <p>''It was definitely an endorsement of the city and, frankly, of the English-reading audience,'' Alan E. Allnut, editor of the 222-year-old newspaper, said over lunch in a French restaurant in the gradually gentrifying Vieux Port neighborhood.</p>
        <p>All of a sudden, Montreal, with its improving economy, European style and cheap real estate, is looking more and more attractive. Mr. Bronfman, the co-chairman of the Expos, said of friends who have left, ''There are a lot of people who are in Toronto who are dying to come back.''</p>
        <p>In fact, Toronto Life magazine committed a very public hara-kiri for a boosterish city monthly. The cover of an issue last fall was devoted to a photograph of a smoked meat sandwich, with the title, ''Where to find Montreal in Toronto: the food, the fashion, the booze, the fun -- a guide to all things Montrealish.''</p>
