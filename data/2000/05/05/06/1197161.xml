        <p>There was once a time, says the cultural historian Sander Gilman, when Irishmen had their noses surgically altered to look more like Englishmen so they could seem more American. Later many Jews had their noses surgically altered to look more like Irishmen so they could seem more American. Such are the knotty ways in which different cultures pursue visions of beauty, proclaiming timeless ideals while succumbing to the tastes of their time and place.</p>
        <p>In even more knotty ways, contemporary culture is doing the same thing. As an ideal, beauty has been taking quite a beating. It has been viewed as an ideology that is as culture-bound as the taste and distaste for Irish noses. It has come to seem irrelevant to artworks preoccupied with race and gender. And claims for its superiority and moral stature have been beaten down by the memories of how artistic mastery cohabited with evil in regimes like the Nazis'. So beauty is often treated as merely a matter of taste.</p>
        <p>Yet during the last 10 years or so, there has also been a movement in the other direction. The philosopher and classicist Alexander Nehamas has suggested that beauty is once again becoming an academic obsession as philosophers and critics resuscitate the beautiful as an ideal, recasting old philosophical arguments and forecasting new variants.</p>
        <p>These two opposing perspectives have led to a tense mixture of politics and aesthetics, reflected in recent books reinterpreting beauty. Four of their authors gathered under the auspices of the Vera List Center at the New School for Social Research on Wednesday night to discuss their views. They included Mr. Gilman, a professor at the University of Chicago; Mr. Nehamas, a professor of philosophy and comparative literature at Princeton University; Elaine Scarry, a professor of aesthetics at Harvard University; and Jed Perl, the art critic for the New Republic. (Full disclosure: this writer moderated the discussion).</p>
        <p>In Mr. Gilman's view, much evil has been caused in the name of beauty. His book, ''Making the Body Beautiful: A Cultural History of Aesthetic Surgery'' (Princeton, 1999), portrays the quest for physical beauty as an ugly human epic. He tells how flesh and fat and lids and lobes have been cut from bodies and faces to modify ethnic and racial characteristics and create new identities. While cosmetic surgery allows each person to be sculptured into a version of an ideal, that ideal is itself politically constructed and is meant to exclude as much as refine. Surgery can seem to confer power, he said on the panel, adding, ''I can be anyone I want to be because I can control who I am.'' But it also creates servitude to notions of beauty that are no more than ''a reflex of the culture in which we live.''</p>
        <p>In ''On Beauty and Being Just'' (Princeton, 1999), Ms. Scarry also attends to the political aspects of beauty but invokes them in beauty's defense. One of the reasons beauty has been eclipsed in recent decades, she argues, is that it has been considered politically harmful. Beauty is criticized for being a distraction, opium for the elites as well as the masses. What's more, it has been perceived as inherently oppressive, most evidently in what has been called the ''male gaze'' that treats women as objects.</p>
        <p>But this argument, she says, is all wrong. The beautiful is life-restoring, not imprisoning. It serves as a muse of sorts, inspiring the viewer to give birth to other beautiful objects created in homage: paintings, poems, sculptures. And far from distracting from justice, beauty does just the opposite. It teaches a kind of fairness -- the fairness of balance and symmetry. This sense of fairness, Ms. Scarry suggests, is precisely the quality that defines justice. She invokes the philosopher John Rawls, whose vision of justice is of a ''symmetry of everyone's relations to each other.'' So while in Mr. Gilman's view beauty can deform justice, in Ms. Scarry's, beauty leads to it. Beauty is politically beneficial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Nehamas is more reluctant to generalize. In ''The Art of Living'' (University of California, 1998), he argued that the philosophical quest for a worthwhile life does not involve the application of universal principles; each life is given shape in a particular and idiosyncratic manner. On the panel Mr. Nehamas gave a glimpse of some of the similar arguments he is developing into a book on beauty, suggesting that beauty, like philosophical investigation, is also personal, not universal.</p>
        <p>''We can't want anyone or everyone to accept my judgment of beauty,'' he said. Instead beauty inspires communities of shared taste in which notions of moral or political virtue are secondary. But within these communities, Mr. Nehamas argued, beauty provides an education in character; beauty aids in ''the art of living.'' Like Ms. Scarry, he sees beauty as socially therapeutic and enlightening; like Mr. Gilman, he sees it as a conglomeration of contrasting visions, each defining a distinct community.</p>
        <p>As a practicing critic, Mr. Perl has a different perspective. He is less interested in beauty's political benefits or betrayals (although like Mr. Nehamas, he is reluctant to seek universals), attending instead to the ways the eye perceives each artwork. In his latest collection of essays, ''Eyewitness: Reports From an Art World in Crisis'' (Basic Books, 2000), Mr. Perl proposes that art is endangered precisely because it is treated as subservient to political or social ideals. He writes about the ''internal logic of a work of art'' and defends art's ''freestanding value.'' He attacks the manners and machinery of dealers, curators and the media, who he suggests distort the dynamic and mysterious powers of the beautiful.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Perl does not seem to be alluding to beauty as some universal property. It is, for him, inseparable from the work of art. In fact, there are few contemporary thinkers anywhere who would try to define beauty in the abstract; such claims would have to be sweepingly large. Yet until recently this was one of the principal ways in which beauty was discussed. Objects were beautiful because they possessed Beauty.</p>
        <p>In his 1790 ''Critique of Judgment,'' for example, Kant outlined the principles that characterize judgments of beauty. He argued that any judgment of beauty was removed from any considerations of an object's usefulness, political or otherwise. The beautiful object may inspire a desire to possess it or understand it, but the judgment of its beauty is untainted by such considerations of interest.</p>
        <p>In addition, Kant argued, when we are gazing at an object, we do not consider its beauty a mere assertion of taste; we do not emphasize the relative aspects of our experience, like the cultural moment or our mood. Instead, beauty is felt to be universal, beyond the reach of time and fashion or individual whim. We may not declare that everyone will agree with our proclamation of beauty, but beauty inspires a feeling that everyone should agree. The judgment of beauty carries an assertion of authority: something universal has been found.</p>
        <p>Now, of course, such authority is gone. A contemporary judgment of beauty incorporates a belief that not everyone will agree or should agree. Beauty is almost never felt to be universal; it is almost always a product of experience. The judgment of beauty is not free of interest; it is laden with interest. Beauty, far from being independent of usefulness, may even be assessed by its usefulness.</p>
        <p>Not even the contemporary revival of beauty completely undoes this inversion of the Kantian idea. Beauty may create injustice, as in Mr. Gilman's argument, inspire justice, as in Ms. Scarry's, cultivate character, as in Mr. Nehamas's, and serve an artwork, as in Mr. Perl's, but it does not exist apart from place and time. That may be this era's taste in beauty, our version of the surgically altered nose.</p>
