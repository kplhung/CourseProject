        <p>The federal tax fraud case against Albert J. Pirro Jr., Westchester's most prominent real estate development lawyer, was delayed indefinitely today after prosecutors said that they planned to file a new indictment related to Mr. Pirro's business dealings with Robert E. Boyle, the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.</p>
        <p>The move, which emerged during a testy conference late this afternoon before Judge Barrington D. Parker Jr. in Federal District Court here, elicited anger from defense lawyers and exasperation from the normally unflappable Judge Parker. And it added another dimension of legal theater to a case that has already seen its share of surprises.</p>
        <p>Opening arguments had been scheduled to begin Wednesday. Prosecutors charge that Mr. Pirro, the husband of Jeanine F. Pirro, the Westchester County district attorney, and Mr. Pirro's brother, Anthony, illegally deducted $1 million in personal spending -- including cars and home furnishings -- as business expenditures. The brothers, in turn, have blamed each other for the tax mess, but say their situation does not constitute criminal misconduct.</p>
        <p>Now, though, it may be months before the start of what is expected to be one of the biggest trials here in recent memory, thanks to the charge touching on Mr. Boyle.</p>
        <p>''We are quite frankly outraged by the strategy of the government,'' said Robert J. Giuffra Jr., one of Albert Pirro's lawyers, in court. ''What the government here is proposing to do is prolong the process, and prolong it, and prolong it, and put a cloud over his head -- and yes, over his wife's head. The punishment is the process.''</p>
        <p>In the original indictment, prosecutors said that the Hudson Valley Hospital Center in Peekskill had leased space in a building in Croton, N.Y., owned by Mr. Pirro and Mr. Boyle.</p>
        <p>And though Mr. Boyle -- who was not named in the indictment -- was the hospital's chairman, he did not disclose that he was a co-owner of the building or that he had received $292,000 from a separate Pirro company, prosecutors said.</p>
        <p>As a result, prosecutors charged Mr. Pirro with failing to disclose Mr. Boyle's financial interest in Mr. Pirro's companies.</p>
        <p>In December, though, Judge Parker dismissed that charge. And on Wednesday, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld that ruling in a split decision. Nevertheless, federal prosecutors said that a new indictment could ''cure the defect'' in their case by being more precise.</p>
        <p>Cathy Seibel, one of the prosecutors, sounded almost apologetic in addressing Judge Parker today, saying that ''the government doesn't like this better than anyone else.'' But she and Elliott B. Jacobson, another prosecutor, insisted that the charge related to Mr. Boyle was crucial to their case. Mr. Pirro's lawyers have until Monday to respond.</p>
