        <p>The federal authorities conducted a highly classified espionage investigation into whether Israeli intelligence agents used a software company in Missouri to intercept telephone conversations from the White House, State Department and other agencies, government officials said today.</p>
        <p>The counterintelligence inquiry did not find evidence that government telephone systems were penetrated, the officials said. The investigation focused on the Amdocs Corporation, a publicly traded corporation founded by Israelis, but failed to unearth evidence that anyone at the company or connected to it had tried to listen to government communications illegally, the officials said.</p>
        <p>''There's just weren't any facts to support a penetration,'' said a government official who closely followed the inquiry.</p>
        <p>The existence of the inquiry emerged today after Insight Magazine, which is published by The Washington Times, reported that the investigation had uncovered a security breach in the White House telephone system. Other news organizations quickly spread the story over their Web sites, but the accusation of  a major espionage problem collapsed almost immediately.</p>
        <p>White House officials denied the account, and their comments were immediately followed by denials from representatives of other intelligence, national security and law enforcement agencies. These officials confirmed that an inquiry had been carried out, but said that it had led nowhere and was currently inactive, although as one official put it, ''You can never say never in these things.''</p>
        <p>Israeli officials also denied that the Israeli government had intercepted phone conversations of American officials. A spokesman for the Israeli Embassy was quoted by The  Associated Press as saying, ''I don't listen even to the phone conversations of my wife.''</p>
        <p>''Israel does not spy on the United States,'' the spokesman said</p>
        <p>Dan Ginsburg, a spokesman for Amdocs, said tonight that the company was unaware of any F.B.I. investigation ''until we heard about it from reporters last evening.''</p>
        <p>''Beyond that,'' Mr. Ginsburg said, ''we'd welcome the opportunity to work with any investigators or any investigation from any kind. We have not been contacted by the F.B.I. or any other government agency.''</p>
        <p>The investigation began several years ago as an offshoot from another inquiry at the State Department. That inquiry prompted law enforcement and intelligence officials to suspect that Israeli spies might be capable of using technology that was so sophisticated that they could overhear conversations of specific American officials in their offices.</p>
        <p>The investigation shifted to the White House in September 1998 when Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, reported in his impeachment referral to Congress that the Israelis might have listened to amorous conversations between President Clinton and Monica S. Lewinsky. The White House and the Israelis dismissed the reports.</p>
        <p>The accusations resurfaced in March 1999. Gordon Thomas wrote in a book about the Israeli intelligence service, ''Gideon's Spies: The Secret History of the Mossad,'' that the Israelis had eavesdropped on hours of intimate phone calls between Mr. Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky.</p>
        <p>The book said the Israeli secret service ''pondered how to use the highly embarrassing taped conversations; they were the stuff of blackmail, though no one suggested any attempt should be made to blackmail the president of the United States.''</p>
        <p>White House officials again denied the account.</p>
        <p>In using office telephones, top officials conduct conversations over unsecured phones, which can be tapped by outsiders, and secure phones that use sophisticated electronic scrambling techniques to deter eavesdropping. Most conversations are held over open phones, which were the ones that the authorities feared might have been compromised.</p>
        <p>Amdocs is the world's largest telecommunications billing services company, providing software that allows phone companies to prepare bills for millions of customers.</p>
        <p>With $600 million in revenues in 1999, the company has been listed on the New York Stock Exchange since 1998. Its clients include Bell Atlantic, BellSouth, Sprint and Vodafone AirTouch.</p>
        <p>The company operates in 20 countries, and its research and development operation is based in Israel.</p>
        <p>Amdocs provides billing software to Bell Atlantic, which provides the phone systems to government buildings, including the White House and the State Department.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ginsburg said he doubted that  the company even had the technological capability to eavesdrop, in real time, to phone conversations of it clients' subscribers.</p>
