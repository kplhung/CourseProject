        <p>The three leading presidential candidates clashed in a harsh nationally-televised debate that all three acknowledged was crucial to their chances in the July 2 balloting.</p>
        <p>The encounter came after a week of unusual on-camera confrontations between the candidates as they struggled to decide whether to hold the debate at all. By mid-week, when they finally agreed to have the debate tonight, it had become the focal point of the race and proved that television is wielding new power in the quickly changing and highly competitive campaign.</p>
        <p>The stakes were highest for Vicente Fox Quesada, the strongest opposition candidate, who faced off for 90 minutes with Francisco Labastida Ochoa, the ruling party candidate, and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas Solorzano, a leftist contender who has been running far behind the other two. Earlier this week, Mr. Fox dismayed voters with a show of pique on live television during a meeting with his rivals. Mr. Fox's campaign officials feared that if he did not repair his image in the debate, he would never recover the lead he held briefly earlier this month.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox opened by attempting to explain the intransigence he demonstrated before the video cameras on Tuesday, when he tried to force the other two candidates to hold the debate that night.</p>
        <p>''Some people thought I was a little stubborn,'' Mr. Fox said. ''Even my mother said that.''</p>
        <p>''But it takes character and firmness to put an end to 70 years of corruption and poverty,'' he continued, referring to the seven decades that Mr. Labastida's Institutional Revolutionary Party has held presidential power.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fox came on with a battery of positive proposals to support small business, create equal opportunities for women and improve education. He tried to stay away from the blunt, cowboy-style insults thrown at Mr. Labastida in the first debate, on April 25, which included all six presidential candidates.</p>
        <p>Mr. Labastida sought to stay away from negativity and said he represented ''change with certainty, no going back, no leaps into the void.''</p>
        <p>A surprisingly aggressive tack was taken by Mr. Cardenas, who is running for president for the third time. He kept swinging at both of his rivals, although he leveled his most sustained criticism at Mr. Labastida and the PRI government.</p>
        <p>He accused Mr. Labastida and President Ernesto Zedillo of managing the economy ''only to seek personal profit.'' He came down hard against a $80 billion bank bailout which he said was the product of a corrupt alliance between Mr. Fox's National Action Party and the PRI.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Cardenas and Mr. Labastida allied against Mr. Fox earlier in the week to agree to hold the debate tonight, many Mexicans had the impression that the two were somehow allied. Mr. Cardenas went out of his way to dispel that notion.</p>
        <p>In a poll commissioned by the Dallas Morning News and published today, Mr. Labastida and Mr. Fox are tied at 33 percent and Mr. Cardenas has 19 percent, a 9-point surge from his standing as recently as two weeks ago.</p>
