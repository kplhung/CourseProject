        <p>''Mr. Clinton's Disbarment Case'' (editorial, May 25) argues unpersuasively that justice for President Clinton consists of ''no more, no less'' than what another lawyer would receive for similar conduct.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Clinton is no ordinary lawyer. He is a lawyer of formidable understanding who oversees the Justice Department, with all its prosecutorial powers. He occupies a special position of public trust as president. His misconduct and his subsequent rationalizations have done far more damage to the nation than any small-town lawyer who steals money from a client.</p>

        <p>When Arkansas judges review this case, they should take into account the greater responsibility that Mr. Clinton carries by virtue of his high office.</p>
