        <p>The Rev. Gerald H. Anderson has a resume that one would expect had allowed him an unusually broad view of trends within Christianity worldwide.</p>
        <p>A United Methodist minister trained in church history, Mr. Anderson has served as a seminary dean in the Philippines and a college president in the United States, and he has also edited many books on Christian missions.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Anderson is to retire next month as director of the Overseas Ministries Study Center in New Haven, it seemed a good time to ask him what he thinks is the most important development in Christianity during his professional life.</p>
        <p>''I just happened to be giving a lecture on this last night,'' he said, reached by phone on Thursday at a retreat center in Georgia. What he told his audience, he said, was that Christianity was no longer ''a predominately Western religion.''</p>
        <p>''The majority of Christians live outside Europe and North America,'' he said. ''And this represents a monumental shift in what has been called the ecclesiastical center of gravity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Anderson said the greatest momentum in the change had taken place since World War II.</p>
        <p>The study center he directs publishes an annual survey, relying on statistics gathered by David Barrett, editor of the World Christian Encyclopedia (Oxford, 1982).</p>
        <p>Mr. Barrett's statistics point to an explosive growth of Christianity in Africa in the 20th century, Mr. Anderson said.</p>
        <p>As an example of what has happened, Mr. Anderson cited the Moravians, a Protestant group with roots in Central Europe and American communities that date to the 18th century. There are about 700,000 Moravians worldwide, with about 50,000 in the United States.</p>
        <p>''Half of all Moravians in the world today are in Tanzania, in East Africa,'' Mr. Anderson said. ''And the annual membership increase in that nation is more than the total Moravian membership in the United States.''</p>
        <p>The center that Mr. Anderson directs serves as a base for study by missionaries and church leaders from around the world, said Jonathan J. Bonk, the associate director, who will succeed Mr. Anderson.</p>
        <p>''We reflect the shift from the North to the South, and the West to the East, in the demography of our residential population,'' Mr. Bonk said, adding that at least 70 percent of those who study there are from outside North America and Europe.</p>
        <p>Mr. Anderson said a common mistaken impression was that Christian missionary activity diminished in the 20th century.</p>
        <p>''In fact, there are more missionaries at work today than ever before in history,'' he said, adding that there were upwards of 400,000 in the world, Protestant and Roman Catholic -- a more than six-fold increase since 1900.</p>
        <p>''What has changed,'' he said, ''is at least 100,000 of these missionaries are being sent out by Protestant churches in non-Western countries.'' He added one more example: ''There are now an estimated 8,000 Protestant Korean missionaries serving outside Korea.''</p>
        <p>New Context for the Bible</p>
        <p>The Rev. Diane M. Ritzie is an associate pastor, prison chaplain and writer, but lately it is for another role that she has been hearing a favorable response from around the country -- her work on the ''African American Jubilee Edition'' of the Bible.</p>
        <p>The edition (which combines the Bible's full text with illustrated articles on the Scripture's relationship to Africa, African-Americans and the black church) is a new publication of the American Bible Society in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>Ms. Ritzie was the project's editor, taking over in December 1997 and arranging contributions from writers. The result is a Bible prefaced with essays on subjects like ''The Relationship between Hebrew and African Languages'' and ''The Presence and Role of Africans in the Bible.''</p>
        <p>''My aim was to offer hope to young African-Americans,'' Ms. Ritzie, an associate pastor at a Baptist church in New Rochelle, N.Y., said in a phone interview.</p>
        <p>Although the edition (published in King James and Contemporary English versions) is meant to call attention to the presence of blacks in Scripture, Ms. Ritzie said, ''I don't call it a black Bible.''</p>
        <p>''Because I feel God is an inclusive God,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Africans and African-Americans are included in the Bible among God's people, Ms. Ritzie said, adding, ''God is a multicultural God and all nations are included in the Scriptures.''</p>
