        <p>In a decision that builders fear could greatly curtail development in some of the fastest-growing areas of New York State, a judge ruled this week that New York City cannot let developers install septic systems on steeply sloping hills around the city's upstate reservoirs.</p>
        <p>The judge, Luther V. Dye of State Supreme Court in Queens, sided with environmentalists who filed a lawsuit after New York City eased the restrictions on septic tanks in March 1998. The environmentalists argued that allowing the septic tanks would pollute the city's water supply.</p>
        <p>The decision could have broad implications for development in Putnam County, which has the fastest-growing population of any county in the state. In court papers, the county's lawyer, George A. Rodenhausen, estimated that as much as 25 percent of new housing construction in Putnam is taking place on steep slopes, where it will no longer be allowed because of the ruling.</p>
        <p>Developers in the area reacted angrily. ''It absolutely is a terrible decision,'' said Edward Heelan, the president of Heelan Realty and Development Corporation, which owns thousands of acres in Putnam and northern Westchester. ''I would certainly encourage the county government to appeal this judgement.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Heelan said the result of the decision would be ''selective and arbitrary enforcement of a whole series of regulations that go against the very fabric of the constitution of this country.'' He said such regulations generally had been devastating to many property owners because they prevent them from developing on many desirable patches of land in the area.</p>
        <p>Justice Dye ruled that the city, in changing the septic-tank rules, had violated both state environmental law and a 1997 agreement with state, federal and local upstate governments to protect the watershed. That agreement allowed the city to avoid building a $6 billion water-filtration system.</p>
        <p>In September 1998, in response to complaints from communities in the watershed, the city's Department of Environmental Protection eased its rules on septic fields, saying they could be built around the reservoirs on hills that slope by 20 percent if truckloads of fill were used to reduce the slope to a gentler 15 percent.</p>
        <p>Septic fields on steep slopes tend to fail more frequently than those on more level ground, according to technical experts who testified for the environmental groups. The danger is that bacteria-laden waste water from septic systems and muddy runoff from erosion of landfill would taint the reservoirs.</p>
        <p>Charles G. Sturcken, a spokesmen for the city's Department of Environmental Protection, said city lawyers had just received a copy of the decision and would not be prepared to comment on it until next week. But some city officials hinted that it was unlikely that the city would appeal the ruling.</p>
        <p>''This was an example of the city cutting corners in its efforts to protect the drinking water supply for nine million people,'' said Mark A. Izeman, a lawyer for the Natural Resources Defense Counsel, another group that sponsored the lawsuit. ''This is a good decision for those that drink water everyday from the city's irreplaceable supply.''</p>
        <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a lawyer for Riverkeeper Inc., an environmental group that filed the suit, said he did not believe the city had any interest in appealing the decision. He said the city's primary motive in easing the restrictions was to avoid lawsuits brought by developers, which would now be prevented by this ruling.</p>
        <p>With Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani no longer running for United States Senate, Mr. Kennedy said, city officials had little need to placate upstate landowners or politicians. And the tighter restrictions on septic systems would mean cleaner water for city residents, he added.</p>
        <p>But Putnam County, which intervened in the case together with the Coalition of Watershed Towns, a consortium of local governments from west of the Hudson River, has the right to appeal the decision even if New York City chooses not to do so.</p>
        <p>Robert J. Bondi, the county executive, did not respond to a telephone message requesting his comment. The county's director of planning, John J. Lynch, could not be reached.</p>
        <p>Jeff Baker, a lawyer for the Coalition of Watershed Towns, also said he had not yet read the decision. But he said it was unlikely that the ruling would be the final word on the matter. He said he did not believe that New York City had the authority to change the rules on septic systems.</p>
        <p>He said that in future court proceedings he would continue to maintain that landowners could modify slopes on their properties with landfill in order to achieve the required 15 percent grade, which he said was allowed by the Health Department.</p>
        <p>As for Justice Dye's ruling, he said, ''I think it leaves it very murky.''</p>
