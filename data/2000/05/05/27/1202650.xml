        <p>In 1997, the Justice Department briefly looked into whether Attorney General Janet Reno should seek an independent counsel to investigate accusations that Louis J. Freeh, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, had lied to Congress, government and Congressional officials disclosed today.</p>
        <p>The preliminary inquiry concluded that Mr. Freeh did not intentionally mislead Congress when he gave an incorrect explanation as to why the head of the bureau's crime laboratory had been suspended. Instead, investigators concluded that Mr. Freeh had been misinformed, and they noted that he quickly corrected his error in a letter to Congress when it had been pointed out to him. As a result, they concluded, there was no need for any criminal investigation.</p>
        <p>Although the event occurred more than three years ago, the reasons and the way in which details about it surfaced this week involve the continuing battle between the Clinton Justice Department and Congressional Republicans over Ms. Reno's handling of accusations of fund-raising irregularities by Democrats in the 1996 presidential campaign.</p>
        <p>The preliminary inquiry involving Mr. Freeh was contained in documents sent by the Justice Department this week to the Senate and House judiciary committees, which are looking into Ms. Reno's decisions not to seek an independent counsel to investigate Democratic fund-raising.</p>
        <p>The decision not to seek an independent counsel for Mr. Freeh occurred just weeks before it appears Ms. Reno first declined to seek an independent counsel to investigate Democratic fund-raising.</p>
        <p>Senator Arlen Specter, a Pennsylvania Republican on the Judiciary Committee and an ardent critic of Ms. Reno, said the Justice Department had included the Freeh information for highly suspect reasons.</p>
        <p>''This information wasn't even in the scope of our subpoena for information,'' Mr. Specter said in an interview. ''It was gratuitously volunteered, and they did it to beat up Freeh a little bit and to help them defend their decision not to go after Gore.''</p>
        <p>Congressional Democrats declined to comment publicly on the matter.</p>
        <p>Mr. Specter said the Gore and Freeh situations were ''as different as night and day.'' Mr. Freeh, he said, was clearly shown to have made an innocent mistake and had corrected it quickly. The questions about Mr. Gore involve whether the vice president was telling the truth when he asserted he was unaware that his fund-raising efforts were aimed at raising money that is both limited and regulated by federal law.</p>
        <p>A Justice Department spokeswoman said the material disclosing the preliminary inquiry about Mr. Freeh was part of a larger document that was directly responsive to the Judiciary Committee's request for information about the campaign fund-raising investigation.</p>
        <p>''The Senate Judiciary Committee, at the request of Senator Specter requested this body of material,'' said Carole Florman of the Justice Department. ''It was therefore produced to the committee under the accommodation that balances the department's longstanding interest in maintaining confidentiality of our deliberative material and the need for Congressional oversight.''</p>
        <p>Over the years, Ms. Reno, who was once a supporter of the independent counsel law, was believed to have become gradually disenchanted with it. Although she began to seek independent prosecutors less often at the time she declined to do so for Mr. Freeh, she made her most controversial decision nearly a year later when she authorized Kenneth W. Starr, the Whitewater prosecutor, to look into accusations involving Mr. Clinton and Monica S. Lewinsky.</p>
        <p>In a statement today, Ms. Reno said that under the independent counsel law that expired last June, the department had no choice but to begin an inquiry into Mr. Freeh's Congressional testimony. She said that ''Director Freeh made an unintentional mistake'' and that she had the utmost respect for his integrity.</p>
        <p>At the time of the preliminary inquiry into whether he had intentionally misled Congress, Mr. Freeh was an outspoken advocate within government circles for the appointment of an independent counsel to investigate the Democrats, especially Vice President Gore.</p>
