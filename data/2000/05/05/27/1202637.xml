        <p>In the 11 weeks since Vice President Al Gore beat former Senator Bill Bradley in the Democratic presidential race, the two men have not spoken. But there are signs that a reconciliation may lie ahead.</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Bradley say they expect him to appear with Mr. Gore sometime before the Democratic National Convention in August, and possibly as soon as next month. And in a news conference on Thursday night, Mr. Gore acknowledged as much.</p>
        <p>Asked whether he expected to appear publicly with Mr. Bradley, Mr. Gore imitated a fortuneteller, closing his eyes, pointing a finger to his temple and saying, ''I see that in the future.'' He declined to say when the appearance would take place.</p>
        <p>And though the two men have not spoken in weeks, Mr. Gore contended that their relationship was ''in good shape.''</p>
        <p>''Our people are in regular communication,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Some have doubts that those talks can overcome the bad feelings of the primaries. Disappointed with his failure to win a single state and dismayed with Mr. Gore's brass-knuckle campaign, Mr. Bradley disappeared from public view after bowing out of the race on March 9. And Mr. Gore has made little personal effort to draw him out.</p>
        <p>But aides to the two men have been in negotiations that are expected to culminate in plans for Mr. Bradley to campaign for, and possibly with, Mr. Gore. Conducting the negotiations are Tony Coelho, Mr. Gore's campaign chairman, and Rick Wright, Mr. Bradley's close friend and former campaign treasurer. The talks have focused largely on Mr. Bradley's role at the convention and the number of supporters he will be allowed to take along as delegates.</p>
        <p>In his news conference on Thursday night, Mr. Gore said Mr. Bradley would definitely be given time to speak at the convention. Asked about negotiations over delegates, the vice president replied, ''I don't think there will be a problem of any kind.''</p>
        <p>Aides to Mr. Bradley say talks between the two camps have been reasonably smooth. But some friends of his contend that the Gore campaign should have acted sooner to unify the party and recruit his help. They say one reason Mr. Bradley has kept a low profile is that Mr. Gore has not called him personally to request his support. ''They've obviously made a calculation that they don't need Bradley's help,'' said one Democratic member of Congress who supported the Bradley campaign.</p>
