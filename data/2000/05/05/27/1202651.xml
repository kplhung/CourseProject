        <p>New Wave of Growth in Asia Is Reminiscent of 1980's  Less than three years after a plunge in the value of Thailand's currency set in motion a devastating economic crisis across much of Asia, the region is riding a wave of growth reminiscent of the Asian miracle of the 1980's.</p>
        <p>The latest evidence of the resurgence came with a report that Hong Kong's economic output rose 14.3 percent in the first three months of the year. It was the territory's fastest quarter of growth since 1987, and seemed to make the Asian crisis a distant memory. [Page A1.]</p>

        <p>New Wave of Growth in Asia Is Reminiscent of 1980's  Less than three years after a plunge in the value of Thailand's currency set in motion a devastating economic crisis across much of Asia, the region is riding a wave of growth reminiscent of the Asian miracle of the 1980's.</p>
        <p>The latest evidence of the resurgence came with a report that Hong Kong's economic output rose 14.3 percent in the first three months of the year. It was the territory's fastest quarter of growth since 1987, and seemed to make the Asian crisis a distant memory. [Page A1.]</p>
        <p>Demand for Big-Ticket Goods Falls  Demand for big-ticket goods in April registered its steepest decline since late 1991, and consumer spending rose at its slowest pace in nine months, the government said, indicating that the economy may be slowing. Durable goods orders fell 6.4 percent; economists had been expecting a 0.5 percent drop. Consumer spending rose 0.4 percent, while consumer income climbed 0.7 percent; both figures matched forecasts.

        <p>Car Insurance Premiums Edge Up  After falling for two years, car insurance premiums around the country are climbing once again, resuming a steady quarter-century rise. Several big insurers have begun imposing higher prices, and analysts say that by the end of the year most other big insurers are likely to follow. The insurers said they were forced to act because of rising expenses for repairs and treatment of injuries. [A1.]</p>
        <p>Push for Prescription Drug Coverage  Bill Thomas of California, an influential Republican member of the House, and Ron Wyden of Oregon, a Democratic senator, announced that they would collaborate on a bipartisan effort to add prescription drug benefits to Medicare this year. The effort alters the politics of the issue in this election year, at least marginally increasing the chances that Congress can break the deadlock on Medicare coverage of prescription drugs.

        <p>De Beers Seizes Angolan Diamonds  De Beers has begun seizing shipments of Angolan government diamonds after the Angolans scrapped a 10-year-old agreement with De Beers to market stones from an Angolan concession. De Beers officials said they were acting in part because of a $50 million debt owed to the company by Angola. [B2.]</p>
        <p>Boeing's Satellite Deal Is Delayed  Boeing's proposed purchase of the satellite unit of Hughes Electronics faces an extended investigation by European antitrust officials, which may delay the deal. [B2.]</p>
        <p>Toshiba Faces Complaints in China  Toshiba's settlement of a class-action lawsuit in the United States last year has backfired in China, where consumers are charging discrimination because the Japanese electronics maker has not offered them the same deal. Masaichi Koga, a vice president of Toshiba, went to Beijing this week to try to repair the damage. [B2.]</p>
        <p>Markets Closed Memorial Day  United States financial markets, government offices and banks will be closed Monday in observance of Memorial Day. Financial markets will be open in other countries.</p>
