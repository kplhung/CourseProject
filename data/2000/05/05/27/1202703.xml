        <p>The Devils accomplished what seemed impossible six days ago. Tonight, they made history.</p>
        <p>They defeated the Philadelphia Flyers, 2-1, in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference finals to become the first team to advance to the Stanley Cup finals after trailing a conference finals by three games to one.</p>
        <p>Patrik Elias scored both goals for the Devils -- the game-winner coming with 2 minutes 32 seconds remaining -- to send the Devils to their second appearance in the Stanley Cup finals. In 1995, they swept the Detroit Red Wings, four games to none, to win the cup.</p>
        <p>The Devils will play host to Game 1 on Tuesday night at Continental Arena against the winner of Saturday night's Game 7 between Colorado and Dallas.</p>
        <p>''This is unbelievable,'' Elias said. ''We put ourselves in a hole by going down by two games, but we started to believe in the coaches and we got our confidence back.''</p>
        <p>Scott Stevens, the Devils' captain and most dominant player, set the tone 7 minutes 50 seconds into the game with a crunching blindside check of Eric Lindros near the Devils' blue line.</p>
        <p>''He's our captain,'' rookie Scott Gomez said of Stevens. ''We wouldn't be here if it wasn't for him.''</p>
        <p>After Stevens hit Lindros, the head of the former Flyer captain hit the ice. After being attended to by the Flyers' team trainers, Lindros was helped to the dressing room and taken to a hospital for observation. There was no official report from the Flyers on the extent of Lindros's injury.</p>
        <p>Stevens was shaken to see Lindros knocked silly and was consoled by Coach Larry Robinson during the first intermission. ''He's a great hockey player who can dominate games in a lot of different ways,'' Stevens said. ''The playoffs are a physical time of year. I know it was a clean hit and this was a big hockey game, but I don't like to see anyone get hurt. That's the bottom line.''</p>
        <p>Claude Lemieux said, ''That guy showed a lot of guts coming back. Maybe he should not have played. We wish him the best. Eric is a big man and hopefully he can recover from this and move on with his career.''</p>
        <p>Martin Brodeur played a brilliant game in goal for the Devils, making 26 saves. Fourteen of his stops came in the second period, when the Flyers had the Devils on their heels for most of the session. The Flyers scored only three goals in the last three games, and lost the last two by 2-1 scores.</p>
        <p>''Marty kept us in the game in that second period,'' Bobby Holik said. ''Once we got to the third period, we figured it was up to us. We had 20 minutes to get to the Stanley Cup finals and we did it.''</p>
        <p>Elias gave the Devils a 1-0 lead 6:44 into the game on a power play. He found himself open in the slot to the left of goaltender Brian Boucher and one-timed a pass from Jason Arnott near the end boards.</p>
        <p>Rick Tocchet tied the score at 1-1 early in the second on a rebound from close range.</p>
        <p>The game remained tied until Elias broke the deadlock with his seventh goal of the the playoffs with 2:32 left in the game at First Union Center. Alexander Mogilny began the winning sequence by wrapping the puck around the boards from behind the net to Arnott, who was in the right circle. Arnott tossed a pass into the slot to Elias, who eluded Dan McGillis in the slot and knocked it past beat Boucher.</p>
        <p>''Arnie kind of fanned on his shot and I snuck from behind the net and McGillis didn't see me,'' Elias said. ''I don't know what I was feeling, such excitement and pride.''</p>
        <p>Colin White, the rookie defenseman of the Devils, took the fourth penalty in the game for the Devils and it proved to be costly because the Flyers tied the game on Tocchet's fifth goal of the playoffs.</p>
        <p>Flyers rookie defenseman Andy Delmore, who missed a great chance to score in the opening minutes, took a shot from the left point that John LeClair stopped at the edge of the crease. LeClair, who didn't score in the series, couldn't lift the puck over Brodeur.</p>
        <p>In the ensuing scramble, Stevens knocked LeClair into Brodeur and Tocchet lifted the puck over a prone Brodeur for his fourth of the series.</p>
        <p>Not many observers believed the Devils would rally after Coach Larry Robinson's tirade last Saturday night following Game 4.</p>
        <p>''We wanted to prove we have heart,'' Elias said.</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>The Flyers were fined $10,000 by the National Hockey league shortly after the game for what it called a violation of Stanley Cup playoff regulations. It is believed the reason was because the Flyers never disclosed the extent of the injury to ERIC LINDROS after the game.</p>
