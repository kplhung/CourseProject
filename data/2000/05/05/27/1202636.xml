        <p>Ram Eisenberg, an architect from Tel Aviv, stood at a barbed-wire border fence here today and gazed at the crowd chanting slogans and waving red and yellow banners of Hezbollah, or Party of God, at the Lebanese village of Kafr Kila on the other side.</p>

        <p>Ram Eisenberg, an architect from Tel Aviv, stood at a barbed-wire border fence here today and gazed at the crowd chanting slogans and waving red and yellow banners of Hezbollah, or Party of God, at the Lebanese village of Kafr Kila on the other side.</p>
        <p>''Are you happy?'' he asked the group, many of whom had returned to southern Lebanon after the withdrawal by Israeli troops on Wednesday, and came today to celebrate victory on the Israeli border. ''We're happy for you. Welcome home.''</p>
        <p>A Shiite Muslim woman covered head to toe in an Iranian-style black chador said, ''It's our land,'' and Mr. Eisenberg agreed. ''We're happy for you to go home,'' he repeated.</p>
        <p>Someone handed him a Hezbollah handbill, which he pocketed.</p>
        <p>Then the woman asked Mr. Eisenberg if he was Israeli, adding matter-of-factly, ''If you are Israeli, I kill you.''</p>
        <p>Unfazed, Mr. Eisenberg replied, ''I hope you change your mind.''</p>
        <p>The bizarre encounter, impossible two days ago, was part of the new reality that has swiftly taken shape here since the Israeli pullout.</p>
        <p>A border crossing that had been run by the Israelis, known as the Good Fence, where relatives of their Lebanese militia allies used to come to work in Israel, vanished overnight as the Israelis moved back to the international boundary.</p>
        <p>Today the area was swamped by Lebanese visitors who walked and cruised in honking vehicles on their side of the border fence, hoisting banners of Hezbollah and another Shiite group, Amal, in view of Israeli soldiers and visitors to Metulla.</p>
        <p>The defiant display of support for what Israelis have long considered an archenemy caused hardly a ripple on the Israeli side. The soldiers just looked on, and Israeli sightseers, kept at a distance by the troops, peered at the convoys through binoculars, trying to identify the militia flags by their colors.</p>
        <p>''Let'em blow off steam,'' said Yaakov Orbach, a visitor from Petah Tikvah.</p>
        <p>Moshe Biton, from neighboring Qiryat Shemona, a town that has been battered by Hezbollah rockets, said as he watched: ''It doesn't bother me. It's their territory and they have a right to do what they want, as long as no Israelis are hurt.''</p>
        <p>Rivka Sayag, from Holon, chatted on a cell phone with a friend, describing the spectacle across the fence. ''It's kind of nice,'' she said. ''If we live in peace, it'll be O.K.''</p>
        <p>Since the withdrawal, residents of Israeli border communities have been enjoying just that. After years in which the thunder of artillery and the clatter of helicopters were a daily background noise, a remarkable quiet has settled over the border zone. ''The quiet is ringing in my ears,'' said Yossi Beter of Kibbutz Lahavot Habashan.</p>
        <p>But not everyone was happy with the changes across the fence. Looking through binoculars, Yisrael Abramov, a contractor from Herzliya, said Hezbollah's victory celebrations were a result of a hurried and disorganized Israeli pullout.</p>
        <p>''The problem is that they're waving flags and we're not,'' he said. ''We've lost faith in our flag and country.''</p>
        <p>On the Lebanese side, people vented anger at Israel and jeered soldiers, bitter after years of occupation, shelling and bombardments that caused thousands of casualties.</p>
        <p>''There can be no peace with Israel, because they've killed children and destroyed houses,'' said Hassan Rashid, a student who returned to his village of Khiam after eight years.</p>
        <p>Other people said there could be no guarantee of peace on the frontier, because Israel was Arab land. ''Ask Hezbollah what will happen,'' a woman shouted. ''If Israel leaves Palestine there will be peace.''</p>
        <p>There was evident pride that this time, in the view from the Hezbollah side of the fence, the Israelis had been compelled to withdraw from Arab territory by force.</p>
        <p>A group of Druze from the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights arrived at the border fence from the Israeli side to share the moment with the Lebanese. Flashing V-signs high in the air, Saleh Abu Saleh from Majdal Shams wished a speedy Israeli withdrawal from the Golan. ''God willing it will happen soon,'' he boomed. ''Victory to the Arabs.''</p>
        <p>But beyond the slogans and display of symbols, there were tentative signs of readiness to keep the border calm. Israeli soldiers kept a low profile, emerging from their base only to remove people on the Israeli side who had approached the border fence.</p>
        <p>Issam Rashid, also from Khiam, said the Lebanese were ready for a ''calm, not peace'' with Israel.</p>
        <p>Mr. Eisenberg, the architect, said  his verbal exchange was a step in that direction. ''It was a chance for them to see that there's a human being on the other side,'' he said.</p>
