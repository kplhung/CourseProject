        <p>If Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette held a garage sale before the deluge, it probably looked a lot like the scene at Sotheby's yesterday, where Saul and Gayfryd Steinberg offered to unload hundreds of their possessions, from a multimillion-dollar commode to the living room curtains.</p>
        <p>That was not all Mr. Steinberg sold yesterday. Reliance Group Holdings, the insurance company he has owned for three decades that has been teetering on the brink of insolvency, announced that an investment concern would buy Reliance for the fire-sale price of $2.55 a share.

        <p>If Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette held a garage sale before the deluge, it probably looked a lot like the scene at Sotheby's yesterday, where Saul and Gayfryd Steinberg offered to unload hundreds of their possessions, from a multimillion-dollar commode to the living room curtains.</p>
        <p>That was not all Mr. Steinberg sold yesterday. Reliance Group Holdings, the insurance company he has owned for three decades that has been teetering on the brink of insolvency, announced that an investment concern would buy Reliance for the fire-sale price of $2.55 a share. [Page C1.]</p>
        <p>It is a stunning twist in the story of a Wall Street wunderkind turned corporate raider who, with his glamorous young wife, took New York society by storm in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>While the Steinbergs were well known for their generous charitable contributions, they were also infamous for a certain ''let them eat cake'' extravagance. There was, for example, the million-dollar party Mrs. Steinberg gave for her husband's 50th birthday in 1989, at which models dressed up to look like Mr. Steinberg's favorite old masters' paintings. (He is selling those, too.)</p>
        <p>Then there was the enormous Park Avenue penthouse, once John D. Rockefeller's, and at 34 rooms and 19,000 square feet very likely the largest apartment in New York. (It, too, has been sold, to a Wall Street financier for more than $30 million.)</p>
        <p>As for the furnishings, well, based on the auction yesterday, if it wasn't gold, the Steinbergs did not own it. Unless, perhaps, it was ormolu-encrusted, bronze-mounted, rose-strewn, fringed, tasseled, brocaded, or covered with gilded sphinxes and sea serpents. Or someone else's family crest.</p>
        <p>There were marble-topped gilt tables with gold lions' heads, and brocade-covered gilt benches with gold lions' feet, and a velvet-clad gilt settee wearing what looked like a gold-feathered crown. There was a 21-foot-long dining room table and 23 mahogany chairs. There were a pair of gold-and-red porcelain jars on gilt-wood stands that were just shy of five feet tall.</p>
        <p>Little of this stuff looked easy to live with; the man who bought the jars and a pair of monster-studded gold tables refused to give his name but did say he had not decided what to do with his purchases.</p>
        <p>The Steinbergs did not respond to requests, made through Sotheby's, for an interview. According to the catalog, they plan to move to a smaller place now that they have only one child living at home.</p>
        <p>However grand (or grandiose) their furniture, the Steinbergs were not the sort of people who worried that guests would put their glasses down on the furniture and make rings, said Duane Hampton, whose late husband, Mark, decorated the apartment with the Steinbergs. ''It was much more comfortable than you could ever imagine,'' she said. ''It wasn't as off-putting as you think.''</p>
        <p>While the Steinbergs have been associated with the wretched excess of the 1980's, much of the decorating actually occurred in the 1990's, Mrs. Hampton said.</p>
        <p>And indeed, mogul-hood has changed little over the centuries. The Steinbergs might well have felt at home in the 1760's, when William Beckford, a sugar nabob, commissioned a commode covered with rococo gilded bronze. They bought it at auction in 1989. Some of the bronze had been removed over the years, but the Steinbergs painstakingly restored it. It was the most expensive piece at the Steinberg auction, bought by a private collector, bidding by phone, for $2.2 million, well under the estimate of $3 million to $4 million.</p>
        <p>Perhaps because of the Memorial Day weekend, only about 50 people were in the auction room at any one time during the almost six-hour event, and much of the buying was done by dealers.</p>
        <p>But not all. David and Simone Levinson said they were there not because of the Steinbergs, but because they had fallen in love with a 19th century harp. After spirited bidding, they won it for $25,000 (and picked up a pair of china pickle dishes for $1,500 on the spur of the moment).</p>
        <p>Does either of them play the harp? ''Not yet,'' Mr. Levinson said.</p>
        <p>All in all, the auction raised $12.5 million, including the commissions charged to buyers, which is about what Sotheby's had estimated before the sale. A few things failed to sell, including the curtains and a pair of chintz sofas.</p>
        <p>There was a time when $12 million would have sounded like an absurdly small sum to be mentioned in the same breath as Mr. Steinberg, who began making his fortune shortly after graduating from the Wharton School in 1959.</p>
        <p>Almost immediately, he began Leasco, which leased out computers in the days when they were new and expensive and the size of a truck.</p>
        <p>When the company went public in 1965, it and Mr. Steinberg became darlings on Wall Street, which was then in the throes of a stock market mania similar to the recent passion for technology stocks. Just three years later, he took over Reliance, a stodgy insurance company.</p>
        <p>In the ensuing decades, Mr. Steinberg bought and sold companies right and left, but he became most famous for the deals he did not do. His 1969 run at Chemical Bank failed. In 1984, Disney paid him $60 million to go away, in what critics dubbed ''greenmail.'' It was a charge that would dog him throughout his deals in the 1980's.</p>
        <p>That same year, he married Gayfryd, his third wife, and she was soon known for her elaborate dinner parties and her scarlet and gold living room. The couple were fixtures on the charity circuit.</p>
        <p>There was soon one of those Eighties moments, when Mr. Steinberg's daughter Laura married Jonathan Tisch, himself the child of a fabulously wealthy family. The Steinbergs filled the Central Synagogue with their antiques, and shined searchlights outside the stained glass windows while the bride and her 10 attendants walked down the aisle. The reception for more than 500 people took place at the Metropolitan Museum of Art (of course). Mrs. Steinberg said the event was ''very much a family party and a young people's party.''</p>
        <p>A pal of Michael Milken, the junk bond king of Drexel Burnham Lambert, Mr. Steinberg used that Wall Street firm to take Reliance public in 1986. A year later came the crash, and the takeover game ended.</p>
        <p>So, too, did some of the high-society doings at which Mr. and Mrs. Steinberg had shone in the 1980's. Mrs. Steinberg continued to raise money for worthy causes, but even that brought her grief.</p>
        <p>In 1990, she quit her post as president of PEN, the literary group, after the writer Ken Auletta said she and her husband were trying to use the group to gain respectability (he had previously called Mr. Steinberg sleazy).</p>
        <p>The early 1990's were quieter on the Steinberg front. Shareholders began to complain about Mr. Steinberg's management, contending that he ran Reliance not for the stockholders' benefit, but for his family's. They continued to own much of the stock, and several Steinberg relatives worked there.</p>
        <p>That year, Mr. Steinberg had a mild stroke, at 55.</p>
        <p>But he remained president of Reliance until February, when the company's troubles could be ignored no longer. Reliance had lost more than $310 million in 1999 because of problems in the commercial property and casualty business and its involvement in a controversial workers compensation program. The stock price had plunged from almost $20 in 1998 to well under $3.</p>
        <p>Burdened with more than $700 million of debt, much of which was about to come due, Reliance was forced in February to sell its only profitable business; Mr. Steinberg stepped aside as chief executive, though he remained chairman.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, that all ended. The Leucadia National Corporation agreed to buy Reliance for the equivalent of $2.55 a share in Leucadia stock and to assume the debt. Wall Street estimates that Mr. Steinberg will receive Leucadia shares worth about $93 million.</p>
        <p>Exactly how much of that he will keep is unclear, in part because the Steinberg family in the past has borrowed money against the value of their shares. Just a year ago his shares were worth more than $350 million.</p>
        <p>Whatever their future, it seems unlikely that the Steinbergs will soon resume their gold-plated place in New York's consciousness. In the Sotheby's catalog, Mrs. Steinberg suggests that the family will be living in a less colorful way. ''Funnily enough,'' she said, ''I have kept a lot of brown furniture, which I never thought I would when I started years ago.''</p>
