        <p>Using the sand and surf as a backdrop, President Clinton announced new initiatives today intended to preserve the nation's fragile shoreline and threatened coral reefs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton directed the Commerce Department and the Department of the Interior, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, to strengthen ocean protections through administrative steps similar to the ones applied to large tracts of land protected as wilderness areas. Coming in the final months of his presidency, Mr. Clinton's protections would not require approval by Congress but could be undone by his successor.</p>
        <p>''Beachlines and coastlines are now our No. 1 tourist destination,'' the president said as he strode onto the sand on this barrier island.</p>
        <p>''Our oceans, however, are far more than a playground,'' Mr. Clinton continued. ''They have a central effect on the weather, on our climate system. Through fishing, tourism and other industries, ocean resources -- listen to this -- support 1 out of every 6 jobs in the United States of America.''</p>
        <p>The president, who spoke over a roaring surf as sea gulls flew overhead, directed the Interior and Commerce Departments to set up a system of ''marine protected areas'' to coordinate the hodgepodge of federal protections now in place for beaches, reefs and other marine habitats.</p>
        <p>His order did not specify any areas, but it requested recommendations on shorelines in need of limits on activities like fishing, offshore oil drilling, mining and dumping.</p>
        <p>As it is, the National Park Service protects 54 marine areas, which cover more than three million acres of water, including Glacier Bay in Alaska, the Everglades in Florida, and here on Assateague, an island renowned for the wild horses that roam its marshlands. Other marine areas have been set aside as wildlife refuges under the supervision of the Fish and Wildlife Service or the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</p>
        <p>''These different protections have all been fragmented,'' said David Hayes, deputy secretary of the interior. ''And for the first time under the executive order, there's going to be a requirement that the agencies work together and look together at the protections that we have, and determine whether we need new protections or not.''</p>
        <p>Although the details remain to be worked out, some commercial fishermen were nervous that their favorite spots might be declared off-limits.</p>
        <p>''The whole world is against watermen, and now you have the world plus the president,'' Freeland Mason, past president of the Virginia Watermen's Association, told The Associated Press. ''The conservationists want to cut out all commercial fishing. They don't want any fishing except by hook and line. The waterman is an endangered species these days.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton also directed the environmental agency to adopt tougher water pollution standards to protect beaches and coastal areas, and to identify areas where additional protections are required.</p>
        <p>''They're going to go back and look at their permitting process for all of the ocean discharges that could have an impact in ocean areas, and make sure that those are fully scientifically based, and if necessary, to increase the protection,'' said James Baker, administrator of the oceanic and atmospheric agency.</p>
        <p>As it is now, thousands of beaches are closed every year as heavy rains cause sewers and drains to overflow, washing sewage into the surf. That polluted runoff can cause a variety of health hazards, including dysentery and hepatitis. It also leads to the growth of toxic algae and threatens marine life.</p>
        <p>Without better protections, polluted shorelines can only get worse as nearly half of all development in the United States is along coastlines.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton also ordered the development of a plan within the next 90 days to protect the coral reefs off a 1,200-mile string of uninhabited islands in northwestern Hawaii. Coral reefs, which harbor an abundance of marine life, are threatened worldwide from pollution, overfishing and rising ocean temperatures.</p>
        <p>The Hawaiian reefs, first protected when President Theodore Roosevelt created the Hawaiian Islands National Wildlife Refuge, make up nearly 70 percent of the coral in United States waters and support threatened sea turtles, monk seals and other marine life.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's plan, which will probably increase the zone of protected coral off Hawaii, would be developed in cooperation with the Hawaiian authorities, officials said.</p>
        <p>In announcing the initiatives, Mr. Clinton made both environmental and economic arguments.</p>
        <p>''The old idea that we can only grow by putting more pollution into our lakes and rivers and oceans must finally be put to rest,'' he said. ''Indeed, it is now clear that we can grow our economy faster over the long run by improving our environment, and it's really not enough for us just to try to keep it as it is. We have to do better.''</p>
        <p>Although the president has used his executive authority to impose an array of environmental protections, Congress is in charge of the purse strings, and Republican leaders have been reluctant to spend money for all of what Mr. Clinton considers critical environmental priorities.</p>
        <p>Pete Jeffries, communications director for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, said the president was acting unwisely by expanding protected areas without giving sufficient resources to the ones already on the books.</p>
        <p>''Republicans want to take a responsible, common-sense approach to our environment,'' Mr. Jeffries said.</p>
