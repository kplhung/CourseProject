        <p>Salt Lake City officials released a document yesterday that appeared to outline the plan for cash payments and other illicit favors that blossomed into an embarrassing scandal in the securing of the 2002 Winter Games. Two delegates of the International Olympic Committee not previously connected to the Salt Lake City scandal were implicated in the document. They face possible sanctioning by the I.O.C.'s ethics commission, which said it would investigate the 28-page document.</p>
        <p>Ten I.O.C. delegates resigned or were dismissed last year after it was revealed that Salt Lake City officials had spent more than $3 million on a program of providing cash payments, medical benefits, scholarships and other favors in an attempt to win the 2002 Games. Revelations from other Olympic bids have implicated about a third of the I.O.C.'s 114 delegates in some form of inappropriate activity and clearly established that many people were aware of which delegates sought special favors in return for their votes.</p>
        <p>The memo released yesterday is  known as the ''geld document,'' because ''geld'' -- the German word for money -- is next to the names of a handful of I.O.C. delegates.</p>
        <p>It cannot be fully interpreted because it contains no dates. It is not known whether the document reflected a strategy of influence or was an archive of payments or favors handed out.</p>
        <p>The document was previously turned over to the United States Justice Department. Thursday, after the Justice Department said it did not intend to indict the Salt Lake City Organizing Committee as a whole, the committee decided to release the document.</p>
        <p>The document was believed to have been retrieved from a computer belonging to Dave Johnson who, along with Tom Welch, were the two chief architects of Salt Lake City's bid to acquire the 2002 Winter Games, according to an Olympic official who requested anonymity.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department said Thursday that it did not preclude indicting individual officials involved in the Salt Lake City bid. Three persons have already been indicted.</p>
        <p>Documents revealing the personal tastes of I.O.C members have previously been made public. However, the ''geld'' document is the first in which direct references to money were made.</p>
        <p>Some of the references in the document were benign, such as the notation that the late Rene Essomba of Cameroon loved bow ties. But the word ''geld'' was also mentioned next to Essomba's name, as was the fact that his daughter was in college in Washington. It was the revelation of her scholarship that brought the scandal to light.</p>
        <p>The word geld also appeared next to the names of two persons not previously linked to the Salt Lake scandal: Francis Nyangweso of Uganda and Tony Bridge of Jamaica. They will be investigated by the I.O.C.'s ethics commission.  Nyangweso's name surfaced in regard to the Sydney bid when he was promised $35,000 the night before Sydney narrowly defeated Beijing to host the 2000 Summer Games.</p>
        <p>The names of others who would later resign or be dismissed during the scandal were mentioned in the document, giving the impression that Salt Lake City officials knew exactly who could be influenced illicitly.</p>
        <p>Critics of the I.O.C. have asked how, with the same names surfacing repeatedly in various bids, I.O.C. officials could claim not to have known about illicit favors.</p>
        <p>''I continue to say I didn't know about the activities of Salt Lake City,'' said Anita DeFrantz, a delegate from the United States.</p>
        <p>''I do know the document will be turned over to the ethics commission. We have a process in place to deal with this. The system is working.''</p>
