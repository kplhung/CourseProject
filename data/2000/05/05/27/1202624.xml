        <p>Editorial calls for suspension of New York Apple Tours' license to operate big double-decker tour buses on NYC streets, contending they are menace to pedestrians; cites tour company's 'appalling record,' which now includes death of pedestrian Randolph Walker</p>

        <p>Randolph Walker, a 71-year-old actor, had the right of way on Monday afternoon when a large red New York Apple Tours bus ran him over at a corner crosswalk. The bus driver did not have a proper license. The bus was not supposed to be turning onto a side street. The tour company that owns the bus has been issued 1,800 summonses for traffic violations, many for reckless driving. The buses, imported from Britain, have had trouble meeting national safety and environmental standards.</p>
        <p>Given this appalling record, the question is why it has taken the death of an innocent person to finally persuade New York City to ask an administrative law judge for an immediate suspension of the company's license. Neighborhood activists in the areas near Broadway and Times Square have been protesting these oversized vehicles since they first appeared almost eight years ago. The main complaints have been that the buses pollute the air when they are idling , then threaten life and limb when they hurtle down side streets.</p>

        <p>Randolph Walker, a 71-year-old actor, had the right of way on Monday afternoon when a large red New York Apple Tours bus ran him over at a corner crosswalk. The bus driver did not have a proper license. The bus was not supposed to be turning onto a side street.

        <p>Given this appalling record, the question is why it has taken the death of an innocent person to finally persuade New York City to ask an administrative law judge for an immediate suspension of the company's license. Neighborhood activists in the areas near Broadway and Times Square have been protesting these oversized vehicles since they first appeared almost eight years ago. The main complaints have been that the buses pollute the air when they are idling , then threaten life and limb when they hurtle down side streets.</p>
        <p>Some residents suspect the city has ignored their complaints because it is more interested in promoting tourism. They have a point, especially when the same city administration has cracked down on drunken drivers, motorists blocking traffic, speeding taxis and wayward pedestrians.</p>
        <p>Mr. Walker's death should have given this problem more urgency, but an administrative law judge for the Department of Consumer Affairs delayed even a temporary suspension of the company's license yesterday until after the Memorial Day weekend. Meanwhile, protesters have been trying to scare bewildered tourists away from the Apple Tour bus loading areas, and city and state officials are dickering about who has authority to suspend quickly any operation with this many bad marks against it. One possibility that should be examined is revoking the Department of Transportation license that allows buses to pick up and discharge passengers. That license can be revoked for chronic violation of traffic rules, which is certainly the case here. State agencies that control licensing, insurance and emissions standards should also be working to make certain vehicles are not operated in an unsafe manner.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, these big red machines should not be out there on the city streets. Though they delight sightseers who ride them, they menace those on the ground.</p>
