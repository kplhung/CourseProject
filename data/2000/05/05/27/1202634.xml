        <p>Senator Judd Gregg, a New Hampshire Republican, has released his hold on $40 million in State Department funds appropriated for a United Nations peacekeeping mission in Kosovo, his spokesman said today.</p>
        <p>The senator's spokesman, Ed Amorosi, said Mr. Gregg decided to lift his hold after the Senate defeated a measure to set a deadline for withdrawing American ground troops from Kosovo.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Gregg continues to use his power as chairman of a Senate appropriations subcommittee to block the transfer of $328 million in peacekeeping funds for United Nations missions in East Timor, Sierra Leone and Congo.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gregg met on Wednesday with Richard C. Holbrooke, the American ambassador to the United Nations, to discuss his objections to the release of the money. They reached no agreement, Mr. Amorosi said.</p>
        <p>In a speech on the Senate floor, Mr. Gregg explained that he was blocking the peacekeeping money because of his strong objections to a peace accord signed between the combatants in Sierra Leone, which gave amnesty and a share of power to rebels who have killed and mutilated thousands of people.</p>
        <p>Backing a peacekeeping mission in Sierra Leone, he said, was tantamount to ''endorsing a policy that brought into power people who had committed rape, murder and atrocities.''</p>
        <p>''The policy being pursued in Sierra Leone was misdirected from the start,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''We should not have been making peace,'' he added. ''We should have been taking a harder line.''</p>
