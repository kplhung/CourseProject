        <p>Representative Rick A. Lazio said yesterday that he would not resign his Congressional seat for the United States Senate campaign, but would balance the demands of the campaign trail with the final five months of his term.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio campaigned in New York City for the second time yesterday, greeting commuters and visiting a center for the elderly on Staten Island while his opponent, Hillary Rodham Clinton, campaigned on Long Island, Mr. Lazio's home base, and got the endorsement of a labor federation.</p>
        <p>When Mr. Lazio, who seemed to have anticipated the question, was asked at a news conference if he was considering resigning to focus on his campaign, he replied, ''It is not something I am considering at all.'' He had taken a break from his travels on Tuesday and Wednesday to vote on several bills, including the measure normalizing trade with China, which he supported.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio and Republican leaders said they did not think his Washington duties would distract him from the race, but the issue recalled the 1998 Senate race, when Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato attacked his challenger, Representative Charles E. Schumer, for missing key votes while campaigning. The tactic backfired when it was learned that Mr. D'Amato, who lost the race, had also missed legislative votes as a county supervisor campaigning for the Senate in 1980.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio said he had participated in all but perhaps one vote this year, but he did not promise to maintain that record as the campaign intensifies.</p>
        <p>''I don't think I'm going to be able to keep that pace up,'' he said. ''I think the voters in New York are smart enough to understand that I can't make this race, with five months to go, without meeting them, getting to know them, being held accountable and answering your questions. That will mean that some votes will be missed. And so I'm just going to work very hard to make sure that the most significant votes, I'm there for.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio's decision should have no effect on the contest to succeed him as the representative from the Second Congressional District, in Suffolk County. Mr. Lazio's two-year term, his fourth, is up this year.</p>
        <p>Under federal law, if Mr. Lazio resigned on or before July 1, the governor would call a special election to fill the seat for the remainder of the term.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton would not comment on Mr. Lazio's decision to retain his seat.</p>
        <p>Party leaders sought to portray the decision as a sign of diligence to duty that is relatively risk free. Some noted that the House would be in recess for much of the summer, and with all the House seats up this year, few expected critical votes to be scheduled in the fall while members campaigned to keep their jobs.</p>
        <p>''Obviously with what Congressman Lazio has been able to accomplish in one week, we believe he has the momentum going into the convention,'' said Dan Allen, a spokesman for the state Republican committee, which is expected to officially nominate Mr. Lazio at its convention on Tuesday. ''He's got the ability and he is doing his job.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio got a warm reception on Staten Island, a Republican stronghold where Mrs. Clinton has campaigned only once. In contrast to the occasional heckler he encountered while campaigning in Manhattan on Tuesday, Mr. Lazio accepted hugs and kisses from adults and children.</p>
        <p>A few Democrats said they would consider voting for Mr. Lazio.</p>
        <p>''We would have put Hillary in there just because she was Hillary and she was running against Giuliani,'' said Tony McBroom, who works in medical-book publishing and lamented Mr. Giuliani's poor standing with black residents. ''As a race of people we are not too cool with Mr. Giuliani right now. So we would like to hear and see what Lazio has got to say.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's latest endorsement was announced at an outdoor rally held by the Building and Construction Trades Council of Nassau and Suffolk Counties, a Long Island umbrella organization of 38 local trade unions with 60,000 members.</p>
        <p>The council has a history of endorsing candidates from both major political parties, but its president, Jack Kennedy, said that in the Senate campaign, Mr. Lazio ''wasn't even in the running.''</p>
        <p>''The A.F.L.-C.I.O. sent us his record, and his record as far as voting on labor issues and for working people has not been good,'' Mr. Kennedy said.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton's appearance in Glen Cove, atop a flatbed truck decked out with ''Hillary'' campaign signs, was her first foray onto Long Island since Mr. Lazio replaced Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani as her opponent. She spent almost an hour talking with  people in the crowd.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kennedy and Mayor Thomas Suozzi of Glen Cove, a Democrat, introduced Mrs. Clinton to a cheering crowd. She said she was deeply honored to win their support. ''I look forward to forging a strong partnership as we work together on behalf of New York's working families,'' she said.</p>
