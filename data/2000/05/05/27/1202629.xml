      <block class="full_text">
        <p>The United Nations' special envoy to the Middle East said today that Lebanon had indicated that it would accept a United Nations' certification of Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon.</p>
        <p>''The way I read the position of the government,'' said the envoy, Terje Roed Larsen, ''Lebanon will abide by the secretary general's conclusions.''</p>
        <p>The Lebanese president and the prime minister have not made their positions on the certification process public, even as United Nations teams fanned out across southern Lebanon today to verify whether Israel's pullout was complete.</p>
        <p>But if Mr. Larsen's assessment proves correct, it could smooth a significant bump in the road ahead. A rejection by Lebanon of the United Nations' certification would give the green light to guerrillas of the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah, or Party of God, to continue their violent struggle against Israel.</p>
        <p>With official Lebanese acceptance, however, Hezbollah, despite its fiery statements, would probably incline toward restraint. Sheik Hassan Nasrallah, the group's leader, has said many times that he will not defy the Lebanese government.</p>
        <p>Today, in another sign of the way Sheik Nasrallah and the Lebanese establishment are embracing each other this week, the sheik appeared for the first time in front of a Lebanese, rather than a Hezbollah, flag at a large victory rally. In the southern town of Bint Jbail, a couple of miles from the Israeli border, he also went out of his way to pronounce the Israeli withdrawal this week from its former security zone as a victory for all of Lebanon and not just for his fighters.</p>
        <p>On Thursday night, Sheik Nasrallah spoke freely with foreign journalists, analyzing events for the first time since the Israeli withdrawal. He said the fact that the Israelis were able to withdraw without any casualties was not for Hezbollah's lack of trying. His fighters fired on Israeli troops, but they did so under heavy aircraft cover and at night, he said.</p>
        <p>The sheik also said Hezbollah's march through southern Lebanon on Tuesday, when they retook village after village and forced an overnight Israeli withdrawal from the zone, was so spontaneous that neither Syria nor Iran knew about it in advance.</p>
        <p>''They found out like everybody else did,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The Lebanese government's position has been murky since the United Nations Security Council rejected Beirut's claim that the withdrawal will be complete only if Israel also pulls out of a remote pocket of disputed land beside the Golan Heights known as the Shebaa Farms.</p>
        <p>On the one hand, rejecting the Security Council's position would prove costly for Lebanon, which needs the United Nations' assistance and also seeks international backing to rebuild the war-ravaged southern zone. On the other hand, Lebanon faces pressure from Hezbollah and Syria to hold fast to its principles.</p>
        <p>Giving Lebanon a way to accept the United Nations' authority without compromising its position, the United Nations underlined that it was not determining sovereignty over the Shebaa Farms area, which was under Syrian control when Israel occupied it. Lebanon and Syria could draft new maps clearly defining their border, Mr. Larsen said, and petition the Security Council to change its resolutions accordingly.</p>
        <p>Hezbollah has an interest in keeping the conflict alive, apart from its ideological one. If the withdrawal is accepted, the Lebanese Army will eventually move into the southern zone and then seek to disarm the guerrillas. But Hezbollah and the Syrian government, which assists it, are not ready to lay down their weapons.</p>
        <p>So it suits their purposes to insist that the occupation of southern Lebanon still exists even if Hezbollah quietly agrees not to take the initiative in any violence toward Israel. How this contradiction resolves itself will be seen after the United Nations certifies the Israeli withdrawal, which is expected to happen soon.</p>
        <p>Sheik Nasrallah said this week that Hezbollah would not attack civilians across the border.</p>
        <p>''Then again,'' he said, ''not all Israelis are civilians, so anything is possible.''</p>
