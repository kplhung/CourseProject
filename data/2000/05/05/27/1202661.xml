        <p>Less than three years after a plunge in the value of Thailand's currency set off a devastating economic crisis across much of Asia, the region is riding a wave of growth reminiscent of the Asian miracle of the 1980's.</p>
        <p>The latest evidence of the resurgence came today with a report that Hong Kong's economic output rose 14.3 percent in the first three months of the year. It was the territory's fastest quarter of growth since late 1987, and seemed to make the Asian crisis a distant memory.</p>
        <p>Other Asian economies, from South Korea to Singapore, are growing at rates much faster than the most optimistic forecasters had predicted -- powered, to a large extent, by a booming demand for Asian exports of computers, electronics, machinery and textiles in the hot economy of the United States.</p>
        <p>Earlier this month, the Salomon Smith Barney investment bank raised its full-year forecast for Asia's regional growth to 6.9 percent from 6.7 percent. This week, Salomon raised it again, to 7.1 percent.</p>
        <p>''The U.S. economy is showing absolutely no signs of slowing, which is great for Asia,'' said Simon L. Ogus, an independent economist here. ''The longer the U.S. keeps booming, the faster Asia will grow.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Ogus and other economists also warn that any downturn in the American economy could ripple harshly through Asia. They note that stock markets in Asia have tumbled recently on worries about rising interest rates and a possible future slowdown in demand from the United States. Moreover, Japan, the biggest economy in the region, is still trapped in a prolonged slump.</p>
        <p>But it is clear that Asian countries have defied the skeptics, who said the region would need a long convalescence from two years of painful economic contraction, plunging asset values and corporate insolvencies.</p>
        <p>The spreading rebound is good news for both the United States Treasury Department and the International Monetary Fund, which had come under heavy criticism in Congress and academia for mismanaging the approximately $100 billion bailout of troubled Asian economies. The critics charged that the Treasury and the I.M.F. prescribed a mix of radical economic restructuring and fiscal austerity that threatened to seriously prolong recessions in the region and leave millions jobless.</p>
        <p>Asia's stronger-than-anticipated rebound has largely silenced those complaints. At the same time, however, it has also reduced the pressure on Asian governments to clean up the debt-ridden banks and corporations that contributed to the crisis in the first place.</p>
        <p>''I think we'll get surprised further on the upside by Asian economic growth, which will have the effect of reducing the pressure for structural reform,'' Mr. Ogus said.</p>
        <p>Enthusiasm about the Asian recovery began earlier this year, when South Korea started posting double-digit year-to-year gains in growth, putting the severe slump that began in late 1997 firmly behind it. South Korea's strong performance has also been accompanied by progress in restructuring its most debt-ridden conglomerates, though some economists still criticize the pace of reform in that nation as too slow.</p>
        <p>In Thailand, generally regarded as the domino that set off the Asian crisis with the devaluation of its currency -- the baht -- in July 1997, the I.M.F. decreed in a review two weeks ago that the recovery ''has turned out to be impressive: output growth this year is set once again to exceed 4 percent, exports are growing rapidly, the balance-of-payments position remains strong, and inflation is well under control.''</p>
        <p>Malaysia, which flouted the I.M.F.'s prescriptions and imposed strict controls on currency and capital flows, has turned into one of the region's export stars. After growing at 5.4 percent in 1999, Salomon Smith Barney predicts Malaysia's economy will expand 7 percent this year.</p>
        <p>Even in Indonesia, widely regarded as the most fragile of the Asian economies ravaged by the crisis, growth is expected to exceed 3 percent this year, although the government has said it could fall to 1.5 percent if political instability persisted. Unlike its neighbors, Indonesia is still spurned by foreign investors.</p>
        <p>In Hong Kong, talk of economic reform in Asia has all but vanished as export-led growth has returned, with more shipments of clothes, toys and machinery. Hong Kong's exports rose 20.7 percent in the first quarter, as it shipped more goods to China, the United States, Europe and other Asian countries. China, which uses Hong Kong as a source for raw materials like unfinished leather, cotton and electronics components, was a particularly good customer.</p>
        <p>Analysts noted that Hong Kong's robust growth was partly a reflection of its poor performance in the quarter a year earlier, when output fell 3 percent. But they still said Hong Kong's performance was remarkable, given that its currency is linked to the United States dollar at a fixed rate. The export success of other Asian countries, notably Malaysia, can be attributed in part to their weaker currencies, which make their goods cheaper overseas.</p>
        <p>''The Hong Kong economy turned out a spectacular performance,'' said the government's chief economist, K. Y. Tang. ''Looking into future months, we still see strong demand for our exports.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Tang said Hong Kong would be further strengthened by the vote in the House of Representatives on Wednesday to grant permanent normal trade status to China; the Senate is also expected to approve such a measure. That step will ease Beijing's entry into the World Trade Organization, a move that Hong Kong estimates will add 5 percent to its gross domestic product over 10 years.</p>
        <p>In the longer run, a more open China could rob this former British colony of its traditional role as a middleman between China and the outside world.</p>
        <p>But few economists are thinking beyond this year. Following the lead of private economists, Mr. Tang revised his official forecast of Hong Kong's full-year growth to 6 percent from 5 percent. He said the revision was conservative because he harbored nagging worries about how long the economic boom in the United States would last.</p>
        <p>''If there is a more distinct moderation in the U.S. economy, somehow -- directly or indirectly -- the Hong Kong economy will be affected,'' Mr. Tang said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Ogus is more emphatic about the damage Asia would suffer from a slowdown in the United States. Given that so much of the region's rebound has hinged on exports, he said Asia's recovery would come to an abrupt halt if demand from the United States diminished. At that point, he said, the lack of progress among Asian countries in overhauling their financial sectors could come back to haunt them.</p>
        <p>Asia's stock markets reflect this sensitivity to the outlook across the Pacific. Fears of interest rate increases in the United States drove down markets everywhere today, with the exception of Taipei, Bangkok and Manila.</p>
        <p>Shares in South Korea plunged 6.13 percent after Hyundai, the country's biggest conglomerate, asked its main creditor for loans to avert a cash shortage.</p>
        <p>Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index declined 1.4 percent to its lowest level in six months, despite the buoyant economic numbers.  Hong Kong has also not emerged from the deflationary spiral that has pummeled the prices of everything from apartments to luxury goods. The local consumer price index fell 4.9 percent in the first four months of this year.</p>
        <p>One unexpected bright spot was a surge in investment in computers and other information technology. After the ascent and crash of Internet-related stocks here, there is now evidence that Hong Kong is investing in cyberspace.</p>
        <p>''This reflects a basic change in attitude toward the new economy here,'' said Ian K. Perkin, the chief economist of the Hong Kong General Chamber of Commerce. ''It's a belated response to what's been going on in the United States.''</p>
