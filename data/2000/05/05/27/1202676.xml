        <p>Every time Tiger Woods stood over a shot this afternoon, people expected something special to happen. There was a buzz in the air, like when a great singer steps to the microphone, or when Mark McGwire steps into the batter's box.</p>
        <p>The electricity started on the front nine, when Woods made four consecutive birdies, beginning on the fifth hole. That birdie barrage set the tone for the day, with Woods on top of his game, in calm conditions that were great for scoring, on a perfectly manicured golf course that was at his mercy.</p>
        <p>Woods kept moving up the leader board until there was no one left to catch. At one point during the second round of the Memorial Tournament today, Woods was at one under par, while Harrison Frazar was already in the clubhouse at nine under. At that point, the question was whether Woods would catch Frazar this weekend. Instead, Woods caught Frazar this afternoon.</p>
        <p>Shooting a brilliant nine-under-par 63, and closing with birdies on the final two holes, Woods took a one-stroke lead over Frazar into Saturday's third round. Woods was 10 under for the tournament (134), one stroke ahead of Frazar (135), who shot a 69, and three strokes ahead of Ernie Els, who shot a sensational 64, but who was overshadowed by the world's No. 1 player. Olin Browne, Brad Elder, Steve Lowery and Mike Weir were tied for fourth place at five under.</p>
        <p>Woods, Frazar and Els will be grouped in the final threesome Saturday, with tee times moved up in an attempt to avoid the expected rain. But today it rained birdies at Muirfield Village Golf Club, as Woods put on a show that displayed all of his talents. There were many highlights during his round, like a chip shot from 18 feet to save par at No. 16, and great approaches at Nos. 17 and 18 that led to easy birdies.</p>
        <p>Woods closed with flair, hitting a 6-iron approach shot at No. 18 that almost ended in the cup. It landed about 20 feet past the hole, but it slowly drew back toward the hole, and the screaming from the gallery grew louder as the ball drew closer to the cup. It finally stopped a foot away from the hole, denying Woods an eagle finish. But he was smiling as he walked up the 18th fairway acknowledging the crowd's cheers, and he tapped in for birdie to end a memorable day.</p>
        <p>When Woods gets the kind of momentum he built today, birdies come in bunches. After his round, which included nine birdies and no bogeys, the defending Memorial champion talked about his superb day.</p>
        <p>''When you hit a few good shots, you tend to build on your confidence, and you tend to string them together,'' said Woods, who is trying to successfully defend a tournament for the first time in his career. ''I've always been one of those players that can string shots together. Once I get it going, I tend to keep it going''</p>
        <p>Woods had plenty to get fired up about, because all parts of his game were working: his driver, irons, short game and putter. He made a 12-foot putt for birdie at No. 5, then he hit a great wedge shot at No. 6 to within a foot for an easy tap-in birdie. At the par-5 No. 7, Woods's second shot went into a front bunker, but he blasted out to within 12 feet, then made another putt for birdie. Then, at No. 8, Woods hit an 8-iron approach shot to within 10 feet, and dropped another putt for birdie.</p>
        <p>Woods birdied the par-3 No. 12, hitting a 9-iron tee shot within 8 feet before making the putt. At No. 13, Woods hit another 9-iron approach shot within 12 feet, before making another putt, pointing at the hole as the ball disappeared and the crowd roared. That was followed by another birdie at the par-5 No. 15, set up by a terrific chip shot to within a foot on his third shot.</p>
        <p>''I'm in good shape going into the weekend,'' Woods said. ''I don't know how many holes we are going to get in tomorrow, but it was a good day to post a good number. We don't know how many holes this tournament is going to be.''</p>
        <p>CHIP SHOTS</p>
        <p>TIGER WOODS's 63 Friday was two shots off the course record. JOHN HUSTON shot a 61 during the 1996 Memorial. . . . JACK NICKLAUS made the four-over-par cut on the number, finishing with a 73 Friday. . . . GREG NORMAN said he would play in the Buick Classic in Harrison, N.Y., next month.</p>
