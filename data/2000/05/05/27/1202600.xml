        <p>NEIL L. RUDENSTINE doesn't even look tired.</p>
        <p>The last that many heard from Mr. Rudenstine, the 26th president of Harvard University, was in 1994, when he slept through a series of public appointments and abruptly took a three-month leave for what he called, simply, exhaustion.</p>
        <p>He returned, tan, from a beach vacation, and since then has completed the largest fund-raising campaign in the history of higher education, turned Radcliffe College into an Institute for Advanced Study with a $300 million endowment and celebrated the 30th anniversary of Harvard's Afro-American studies department with the dream team of black scholars he helped assemble.</p>
        <p>He has done most of it quietly, rarely seizing the stage afforded the head of the nation's oldest and most storied university. This week, without so much as a news conference, Mr. Rudenstine, 65, sent word that he would retire after next year's commencement.</p>
        <p>''It really is exhilarating -- the amount of total firepower it has,'' Mr. Rudenstine said of Harvard, with its 364-year history and its 18,000 students and 2,000 professors. ''It's hard to get through a week without having some kind of a discussion that doesn't really set you off thinking or reading.''</p>
        <p>Pondering his future, Mr. Rudenstine said he would miss the ''effervescence'' of the campus, sighing, ''It's awfully hard to find that in the world.''</p>
        <p>That, and a new place to live. Mr. Rudenstine and his wife, Angelica, an art historian and curator, long ago sold their home in Princeton, N.J., and have been storing their books and etchings in the three-story Colonial, built in 1767, where Harvard's president has lived since 1971.</p>
        <p>Sipping Perrier in the house's library, with its floor-to-ceiling bookshelves and sea-foam-green paint, Mr. Rudenstine stared into space as he reflected on his time as president, once rising to move his gaze out the window to the expansive lawn. A scholar of 16th-century poetry, he could not select a verse, on the spot, to sum up the experience, but said he had lately been leafing through works that were more contemporary. ''It just seemed very important to be in touch with this century and what's going on,'' he said. ''Whatever roads of access I could find, I chose.''</p>
        <p>BORN in Ossining, N.Y., the son of a Russian Jewish immigrant and a first-generation Italian-American Catholic, Mr. Rudenstine started his education at a one-room schoolhouse in rural Connecticut, then climbed the ivory tower, earning degrees at Princeton, Harvard and Oxford. After a dissertation on Sir Philip Sidney, a 16th-century poet, he taught English briefly at Harvard, but spent most of his career as an administrator at Princeton. He is only the sixth president of Harvard appointed since the Civil War and, having arrived in 1991, will have had the shortest tenure.</p>
        <p>Unlike many of his predecessors, Mr. Rudenstine did not establish himself as a kind of public intellectual, holding sway on the issues of the day. He testified before Congress in support of government financing of scientific research, and, in academic circles, was a leading supporter of affirmative action, but never penetrated to the public at large.</p>
        <p>''My voice and voices like it haven't been paid much attention to,'' he lamented. ''I think I assumed, given the welter of voices, it probably wasn't going to be picked up. It's not easy to have your voice picked up these days.'' In 1957, he noted, the president of Princeton was on the cover of Time magazine; ''you can't even conceive of that happening today.''</p>
        <p>Of course, Mr. Rudenstine, like his colleagues at universities around the country, spent much of his time raising money. And he was awfully good at it, averaging more than $1 million a day for six years, a pace that allowed him to shatter a staggering $2.1 billion campaign goal by $500 million.</p>
        <p>''It's not as if it's some kind of extra skill that you have to develop,'' he said with a shrug. ''It fundamentally is an extension of the extent to which you have ideals and goals you're persuaded by. If you believe enough in those things, it resonates with people.''</p>
        <p>The modern university president often seems more chief executive than scholar, a paradigm Mr. Rudenstine rejects. While elsewhere the job has been restructured ''so as to take people further and further away from the things that connect you to the academic heart of the institution,'' he said, Harvard demands that its president stay engaged, by requiring him to oversee all tenure decisions personally. (Mr. Rudenstine has handled more than 250.)</p>
        <p>''You come away with a constant probing of where things are going and why they're going that way,'' he said. ''If you're not recapitalizing your intellectual capital, you're not going to know enough to lead anyone.''</p>
        <p>It is hard to know what to do next, what could possibly match the prestige -- or the perks -- of a post that offered trips to East Africa, Latin America, France, Germany, England and, twice, China. There was that astonishing meeting of Shanghai's Harvard Club that silently spoke the geopolitical story of a century -- a room full of elderly men who had graduated before World War II, another room of young entrepreneurs with degrees from the 1980's and 1990's.</p>
        <p>He will undoubtedly get more rest, though ever since that very high-profile collapse, he has been diligent about downtime.</p>
        <p>''If you don't book yourselves a real vacation around here, six months in advance, you just don't get it,'' he said. Now, the Rudenstines take a week in January, two or three weeks in the summer and lots of long weekends.</p>
        <p>''We've just made sure,'' he said, ''that things didn't get encroached upon and washed away.''</p>
