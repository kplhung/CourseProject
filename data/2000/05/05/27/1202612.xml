        <p>THERE may not be many people this Memorial Day weekend who still remember Squabby. But those of us who do can at last experience closure.</p>
        <p>Squabby departed this world on a sunny spring day in 1995, just three days after he shattered an urban myth by pecking his way out of an egg on my bathroom window's ledge. Until then, it had been widely assumed that there were no baby pigeons in the wild -- who had ever spotted one on the street? -- but now there were pictures of a fuzzy little yellow creature in The New York Times Magazine.</p>
        <p>Then he suddenly vanished, leaving behind a new mystery: who killed Squabby? Pigeon experts offered two theories. Either a crow had gobbled up the 3-day-old squab or one of his parents had accidentally knocked him off the ledge.</p>
        <p>It was a classic nature-nurture question, which I tried to investigate by training a video surveillance camera on the ledge when new eggs appeared in the nest. They didn't hatch, unfortunately, and neither did any other eggs over the next several years, but the round-the-clock surveillance seemed to confirm the nurture theory.</p>
        <p>No crow was ever spotted anywhere near the ledge, and there was mounting evidence of careless parenting. Squabby's mother was named Medea after she accidentally dislodged an egg from her nest. The camera captured Squabby's father, Don Guano, getting so carried away in an adulterous liaison (while his wife was away) that he stepped into the nest and smashed an egg.</p>
        <p>It was a disillusioning spectacle to those of us who consider pigeons to be the ultimate New Yorkers, enterprising creatures in grimy crannies who survive by helping one another. What had gone wrong with this pigeon family's values?</p>
        <p>Perhaps it was a familiar New York problem, the welfare state. I had been feeding Don Guano and his wife corn every morning, hoping to help their family grow, but maybe the handouts were eroding their sense of responsibility. Instead of foraging for themselves, they lolled on the ledge, waiting to eat out of my hand. I instituted a version of workfare by gradually reducing the feedings and eventually kicking them off the dole.</p>
        <p>Don Guano and his wife survived without the handouts, but I saw less and less of them. Their nest became occupied by another pair, and in April the new parents produced two healthy baby pigeons. Here, I thought proudly, was proof that welfare reform works. My ledge was no longer a magnet for shiftless pigeons.</p>
        <p>But a week later the bathroom ledge became a bloody crime scene. The decapitated and mauled body of one baby pigeon was lying outside the nest. It looked like the work of a serial killer, and I began to feel like one of those detectives who can't let go of a murder case. I turned the video camera back on.</p>
        <p>The next morning the carcass was gone, and the videotape had caught the murderer returning to the scene. In the dim light just after dawn, a black figure landed on the ledge and turned to reveal the unmistakable profile of a crow's deadly beak. As the remaining baby pigeon cowered in the nest, the crow lifted the carcass off the ledge and flew off to finish eating it.</p>
        <p>Such must have been Squabby's fate. I can't prove it, but I now believe that neither the welfare system nor his parents were to blame. If anything, Squabby needed an even stronger safety net. He was done in by bad luck and forces beyond any family's control.</p>
        <p>I'm not sure what the human policy implications of this are. Further research is needed.</p>
        <p>The one cheery bit of news this weekend is that the crow didn't return. The remaining baby pigeon -- call her Squabette -- grew rapidly over the next month. By the time she left the nest, this week, she was nearly the size of an adult. And that, it can now finally be reported, is why you never spot a baby pigeon on the street.</p>
