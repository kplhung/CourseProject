        <p>The Big Top is about to get far bigger, and it has nothing to do with circuses. It refers to bridge events scored across the field, and is possible only with computers. Next Friday and Saturday, the World Bridge Federation's Worldwide Pairs will be played in some 60 countries.</p>
        <p>On Friday, about 45,000 players are expected. In that case, the Big Top would set a record with 22,499. The Saturday game will be slightly smaller, with some 38,000 players and a Big Top of about 19,000.</p>

        <p>The Big Top is about to get far bigger, and it has nothing to do with circuses. It refers to bridge events scored across the field, and is possible only with computers. Next Friday and Saturday, the World Bridge Federation's Worldwide Pairs will be played in some 60 countries.</p>
        <p>On Friday, about 45,000 players are expected. In that case, the Big Top would set a record with 22,499. The Saturday game will be slightly smaller, with some 38,000 players and a Big Top of about 19,000.</p>
        <p>The worldwide game began in 1986 with Epson as the sponsor and instant match points rather than the Big Top. One of the best deals ever, shown in the diagram, occurred in 1993, when Zia Mahmood, playing at Honors Club in Manhattan, outwitted the official analysts.</p>
        <p>Zia and his partner, Michael Rosenberg, pushed to six no-trump, with a natural sequence that included a raise from three no-trump to five no-trump, which asked North to select a slam contract. West led a heart, which does not appear to help the declarer. But it did.</p>
        <p>Zia, a brilliant analyst, finessed, won in his hand, and formed an expert plan involving a Morton's Fork Coup. He would take some diamond winners -- three or four, but not five -- and then lead a low spade from the dummy. He would be safe if the spades split evenly or if East held the king.</p>
        <p>In the actual situation, East was due to be forked. If he spent his king, South would have three spade tricks;  if he saved it, South would eventually surrender a heart trick to make his slam.</p>
        <p>The reference is to the chancellor of King Henry VII of England, who extracted money from wealthy merchants with either of two arguments: ''You are spending a lot, so you can spare some for the king.'' Or, ''You are not spending a lot, so you can spare some for the king.''</p>
        <p>The official booklet noted, ''Twelve tricks can, it is true, be made on a neutral lead -- declarer starts spades by leading low from the table -- but this would not be a natural play to make.''</p>
        <p>That analysis was accurate after a diamond lead, or after an unlikely club lead, which attacks South's communications. But it was wrong, as Zia demonstrated, after a heart lead and a winning finesse. And after a spade lead, which happened at many tables, East is forked immediately when South plays low from the dummy.</p>
        <p>For making the slam, Zia and Rosenberg scored 87 instant match points out of a possible 100.</p>
