        <p>Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani said yesterday that Hillary Rodham Clinton and the state's Democratic leadership should apologize for the reported harassment of a police honor guard at the May 16 State Democratic Convention in Albany.</p>
        <p>In the incident, hecklers are said to have spit on the officers, who were from the Albany Police Department, and derided them as ''members of the Giuliani Third Reich.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Giuliani said the Albany police should vigorously investigate the incident, and those who instigated it should be charged with assault.</p>
        <p>''The calling of names is reprehensible, and there should be an apology by the candidate,'' Mr. Giuliani said.  ''The actual spitting should result in an arrest. I mean, spitting is an assault.''</p>
        <p>The incident was reported in a May 19 editorial in The New York Post.</p>
        <p>The mayor's call for action was dismissed yesterday by officials of the state Democratic Committee and Albany's City Hall, a traditional bastion of Democratic politics.</p>
        <p>''If Mayor Giuliani wants a firing squad, he isn't going to get it,'' said John C. Neilsen, the Albany police chief. ''No apologies are necessary'' from the state Democratic leadership, he said.</p>
        <p>Democratic officials said the convention incident had led to an exchange that smoothed things over, at least within their own party. A spokeswoman for Mrs. Clinton, Karen Dunn, said the first lady had called Mayor Gerald D. Jennings of Albany immediately after the New York Post editorial appeared to say she was ''appalled by what was reported.''</p>
        <p>Judith Hope, the chairwoman of the state Democratic Committee, wrote the same day to Chief Nielsen, apologizing for what she called ''despicable actions'' by a small group at the convention.</p>
        <p>And yesterday, Mr. Nielsen said Mayor Giuliani's pique over the incident would have little impact in Albany. ''We did ask the local media if they had any video of what happened,'' he said, ''but we figured if they had it, they would have used it.''  He said the Albany police have ''no plans to take this further.''</p>
