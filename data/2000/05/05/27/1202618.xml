        <p>A Roman Catholic nun from Maryland, ordered by the Vatican last year to end a ministry to gay and lesbian Catholics, said yesterday that she would not comply with a new request by Vatican authorities that she cease speaking and writing about the case.</p>
        <p>The nun, Sister Jeannine Gramick,  said in a prepared statement that the Vatican and the leaders of her order had asked her ''to silence myself.''</p>
        <p>''After finding my voice to tell my story, I choose not to collaborate in my own oppression by restricting a basic human right,'' she wrote. ''To me this is a matter of conscience.''</p>
        <p>For more than two decades, Sister Gramick and the Rev. Robert Nugent, a Maryland priest, had collaborated in a national ministry to gay Catholics, until they were ordered to end that work last July by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, the Vatican body charged with safeguarding church teaching.</p>
        <p>In an official directive, which followed years of investigation by church authorities in the United States and Rome, the congregation said Sister Gramick and Father Nugent had allowed ''errors and ambiguities'' into their discussions of Catholic teaching on homosexuality. The congregation said the two had not sufficiently emphasized church teaching that homosexual acts are ''intrinsically disordered.''</p>
        <p>Although Sister Gramick and Father Nugent said they would comply with the directive, they said later that they felt free to speak publicly about the case itself.</p>
        <p>In a statement yesterday from its provincial headquarters in Baltimore, Sister Gramick's order, the School Sisters of Notre Dame, said that another Vatican body, the Congregation for the Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Faith, recently clarified the original directive. The clarification said Sister Gramick and Father Nugent were barred from writing and speaking about homosexuality and discussing the directive or the procedures that led to it.</p>
        <p>Sister Gramick was told of the limitations on Wednesday in a meeting with the leaders of her order in Rome, who released a statement saying they were deeply saddened that she would not comply.</p>
        <p>Father Nugent's religious order, the Society of the Divine Savior, released a statement, saying he too had gone to Rome this week and been informed of the Vatican's views on its directive. The society said Father Nugent ''has respected in good faith'' the directive issued last year.</p>
