        <p>It was a heartwarming, festive evening, a joint venture by the New York City Ballet and Dance Theater of Harlem.</p>
        <p>The focus on Thursday night at the New York State Theater was ''Tributary,'' the latest premiere in City Ballet's Diamond Project. Yet this entry was unlike the others. It had two choreographers, Robert Garland of Dance Theater of Harlem and Robert La Fosse of City Ballet, and used dancers from both companies.</p>
        <p>''Tributary'' is a delight, a polished charmer set to Mozart (Divertimento K. 251), and it is to be performed again only tonight and tomorrow afternoon. Kyra Nichols, returning to City Ballet after a long absence, and Donald Williams of the Harlem troupe led the cast. On the same program, ''Agon'' was led brilliantly by Mr. Williams and Wendy Whelan, while ''Slaughter on Tenth Avenue,'' also a joint venture, was led with sizzling wit by Caroline Rocher of Dance Theater of Harlem and City Ballet's own Damian Woetzel.</p>
        <p>''Agon'' and ''Slaughter'' are, of course, works by George Balanchine with which Arthur Mitchell was particularly associated as a star of City Ballet in the 1950's and 60's until he left to found and direct Dance Theater of Harlem. Peter Martins, City Ballet's artistic director, conceived this program as a 30th-anniversary salute to Dance Theater of Harlem and Mr. Mitchell. Mr. Mitchell, whose recent hip operation did not prevent him from walking out briskly with a cane, acknowledged a standing ovation at the end.</p>
        <p>This was not the first time both companies performed together under City Ballet auspices, but on this occasion the circumstances and results were very different and infinitely more successful. In 1971, Mr. Mitchell and Balanchine choreographed ''Concerto for Jazz Band and Orchestra,'' named after its 1954 score by Rolf Liebermann. Dancers from both companies were integrated through half of the ballet. But Balanchine was criticized for stereotyping because the jazzier sections were given to the Harlem dancers.</p>
        <p>The paradox, as proved again by Thursday's celebration (a benefit for Dance Theater of Harlem), is that Balanchine freed contemporary ballet from all considerations of race and origin. In Balanchine's neo-classical plotless works, dance for dance's sake means that dancers, black, white or otherwise, need only be themselves.</p>
        <p>The Harlem and City Ballet dancers were indistinguishable as dancers of Balanchinian descent. The four couples who opened ''Tributary'' included two black dancers and both were from City Ballet. Similarly, Dance Theater of Harlem is an interracial company.</p>
        <p>Barely off the ground after its official founding in 1969, Dance Theater of Harlem could not yet match City Ballet's technique in the 1971 ''Concerto.'' But on Thursday, in an evening conducted with brio by Andrea Quinn, the music director of the Royal Ballet in London, it was all hand in glove.</p>
        <p>''Tributary'' is a solid if light piece, soft neo-classicism devoid of difficult steps but not devoid of energetic passages. Those who see its music, a divertimento by Mozart, as a precursor to his ballet ''Les Petits Riens,'' will see its dance pulse as a wise choice for choreography.</p>
        <p>Which passages were created by Mr. La Fosse or by Mr. Garland becomes irrelevant. The ballet is clearly a collaborative effort that plays with the repeats in the music through echoes in the dancing and is, above all, testimony to good manners. Pamela Allen Cummings has designed short, fluffy cloth tutus for the women, and the men topped their tights with loose white shirts.</p>
        <p>The first unit of four couples in green is from City Ballet, the second from Dance Theater of Harlem, and they are superseded by four pairs of soloists in yellow and blue. Andrea Long, who danced with City Ballet, is now with Dance Theater of Harlem and she was joined by Kellye A. Saunders, Cubie Burke and Kip Sturm from the same company, while Eva Natanya, Rachel Rutherford, Adam Hendrickson and Alexander Ritter were from City Ballet. After Mr. Williams and Ms. Nichols, in pink, entered, all the pairs were mixed: one dancer from each troupe. The choreography's lifts, bows and symmetry made for a deliberate prettiness until the yellow-blue soloists played a game of London Bridge.</p>
        <p>Ms. Nichols was her gracious self, led by the hand by Mr. Williams. In a duet following an outburst from the green units, she curled in and out from her partner, who placed her in a variety of lifts. Like a Balanchine partner, Mr. Williams had to be mobile.</p>
        <p>The blue and yellow couples offered a vestige of a mazurka, hand to hip, followed by brief solos for Ms. Nichols and Mr. Williams, who yielded to a lively ensemble passage. There was a wonderful image: a line of men at the front of the stage kneeling, backs to the audience, to the women at the rear. The solo couples each came to the fore before Ms. Nichols swooned in Mr. Williams's arms.</p>
        <p>Whether ''Tributary'' has a shelf life in the repertory remains to be seen, but it held its own after a Stravinsky-Balanchine masterpiece like ''Agon.'' In the central duet, Ms. Whelan and Mr. Williams tied themselves easily into the knots of Balanchine's convolutions. Both have danced their roles in their own companies and they affected each other's performance. Ms. Whelan's customary assertiveness in whipping her leg around her partner's body was matched by Mr. Williams's eagerness. Yet his fluent dynamic complemented her geometric edge, and the final embrace was startlingly tender.</p>
        <p>In the other roles, Maria Kowroski offered a seductive languor, while Peter Boal was commanding. Stacey Calvert, Kathleen Tracey, Arch Higgins, Edward Liang and the ensemble added to the taut performance.</p>
        <p>''Slaughter on Tenth Avenue'' is a ballet within a Broadway show, and Ms. Rocher took to her new role as the dancer portraying a burlesque performer with a laid-back wink. Having danced the Siren in Balanchine's ''Prodigal Son,'' she knows how to seduce. Ladylike in her first duet with Mr. Woetzel, she had all the right leggy stuff in the other torrid duet, and Mr. Woetzel was nicely over the top, exuberant and funny.</p>
