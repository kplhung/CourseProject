        <p>Jeff Colborn plunged into fusion energy research in the late 1980's, first at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and then at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, filled with idealism about fusion's potential for revolutionizing nuclear power generation.</p>
        <p>''I wanted the toughest challenge,'' said Mr. Colborn, recalling the goals he had after studying engineering and physics at the University of California at Berkeley.</p>
        <p>But the entrepreneurial Mr. Colborn, who founded a business during high school selling decals for the motorcycles he and his friends raced, fretted that it could take 50 years before anyone could build a business on fusion. No wonder he is more at home these days as founder and chief executive of Metallic Power Inc., a little-known entrant in the intense race to design and manufacture fuel cells, low-pollution devices that generate electrical current from chemical reactions.</p>
        <p>Although they are similar in many ways to batteries, fuel cells can be quickly regenerated by pumping in new chemical fuel. And unlike fusion, they are teetering on the edge of becoming big business. Several hundred units have been sold already, and some analysts predict a billion-dollar market by 2005.</p>
        <p>The last steps are not coming easily, though. No one is making money yet, and the technology is not ready for potential home-run markets, like power for vehicles.</p>
        <p>The fuel cell companies' slow path highlights the difficulties of innovating for the nuts-and-bolts dimension of the economy. Though this is not the fusion world it is also not the Internet world, where new services can be up and running within weeks and barriers to entry are low.</p>
        <p>''People have gotten used to the pace of change of information technology,'' said Vincent R. Shiely, a vice president who oversees new ventures -- including a research partnership with Metallic Power -- at the Briggs &amp; Stratton Corporation, the largest manufacturer of nonautomotive gasoline engines. ''But this is pushing the frontier of materials, and there are still basic technology and reliability questions.''</p>
        <p>Fuel cell companies are developing everything from replacements for tiny batteries like those used in cell phones and hearing aids to highly efficient power plants big enough to fit the needs of electric utility companies.</p>
        <p>The challenge is to come up with answers to conflicting demands for, among other things, lightness, reliability, durability and low cost.</p>
        <p>Metallic Power has been slowed down by annoyingly mundane problems like troubles making its early designs leak-proof. But there have also been scarier roadblocks, as when Mr. Colborn and Stuart I. Smedley, his chief technology officer, reached the painful conclusion that a system they had adapted from other researchers for converting wastes back into recyclable fuel was hopelessly unreliable.</p>
        <p>Mr. Smedley, a former university professor from New Zealand, eventually came up with a new design that was much simpler, one-tenth the size, and, perhaps best of all, something that Metallic Power's lawyer say he believes is patentable. But it took many months.</p>
        <p>''Multiplying the ideal time for each stage by two has turned out to be a pretty accurate predictor of what actually happens,'' Mr. Colborn said. ''Our schedule has stretched.''</p>
        <p>Metallic Power was founded in 1995 but did not produce its first primitive prototype until late 1997. The company faces steep challenges. Not only is it a relative newcomer with far less capital than many others; it is also using zinc as its fuel, a radically different approach from what nearly everyone else uses.</p>
        <p>Several venture capitalists unfamiliar with the energy business got cold feet after looking closely at Mr. Colborn's plans. Among them was a restaurant owner. ''I spent a lot of time driving to L.A. and eating in his restaurant,'' Mr. Colborn said, but the prospect dropped out when it came time to sign a check. ''Everybody thinks fuel cells are cool, but when they get into it they discover they know nothing about it.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Colborn got a better reception from energy-focused investors like Robert W. Shaw Jr., president of the Arete Corporation, an investment firm based in Center Harbor, N.H., that manages money for utilities. ''Every fuel cell company is struggling with similar problems,'' said Mr. Shaw, whose company's fuel cell investments include $2 million of the $8.6 million Metallic Power has raised in two rounds of financing. ''At the end of the day, this company is going to make something, and it could have a long-term, sustainable advantage.''</p>
        <p>The payoff for fuel cell innovators could be breathtaking, especially if someone can create products that meet the performance needs of the auto industry. ''As soon as someone has a system that operates in all environments at the cost of combustion engines, which is about $50 per kilowatt, it will take over the world,'' said Patrick Grimes, an energy consultant in Scotch Plains, N.J. ''Some ell system will get there.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Colborn's company is focusing first on market niches that can afford far higher prices per kilowatt and are more likely to generate near-term profits, starting with portable generators for homes and small businesses.</p>
        <p>History supports a cautious approach. Fuels cells were described in concept as far back as 1839, but when it came to designing products, other power sources -- from batteries to internal combustion engines to steam turbines -- always seemed to have a better cost-benefit mix.</p>
        <p>So far, fuel cells' only big success has been on space missions, where cells have been used for more than 30 years and cost has been a negligible concern. But there has been renewed interest in recent years, bolstered by new electronic controls, better understanding of which chemicals would make the best fuel cells and, perhaps most important, government research grants and stricter environmental regulations.</p>
        <p>A lot of the interest has been focused on hydrogen-based designs. Most hydrogen cells extract hydrogen from hydrocarbons like gasoline, natural gas or methane. The purified hydrogen reacts with oxygen drawn from the air to create electricity and water vapor.</p>
        <p>Metallic Power, however, is working instead with zinc, which produces electricity and zinc oxide, a harmless powder used in cosmetics, when suspended in an alkaline liquid and then exposed to oxygen. Zinc/air cells, as they are called, are in theory simpler and cheaper than their hydrogen counterparts, according to Mr. Colborn. Other companies experimenting with zinc/air fuel cells include zinc/air battery makers like EVonyx Inc., a subsidiary of Reveo Inc., in Elmsford, N.Y., and Electric Fuel Ltd. of Israel.</p>
        <p>Zinc's biggest disadvantage is that nothing can match the infrastructure already in place for distributing hydrogen. Automotive fuel cells based on hydrogen, for example, could be refueled by today's gas stations with relatively modest changes.</p>
        <p>Hydrogen-based fuel cells are the only commercially available products, and numerous new variants are well down the development path.</p>
        <p>The company most in the Wall Street spotlight is Ballard Power Systems Inc., a publicly traded Canadian company that is 25 percent owned by DaimlerChrysler. In recent months, Ballard has shipped a stationary 250-kilowatt fuel cell generator to European utilities for testing; introduced an improved, compact version of its first automotive cell, which Ford Motor is testing; and announced a partnership with the Sunbeam Corporation's Coleman Powermate unit, a big distributor of portable electric generators, to develop a co-branded fuel cell.</p>
        <p>A newer entrant, Plug Power Inc. of Latham, N.Y., is developing refrigerator-sized cells that run on natural gas or propane for use as home power sources. Plug Power went public in October at $15 a share and soared to a high of $149.75 on March 10. But investors fled after a dose of reality about the pace of development: the company passed a deadline without meeting design requirements of the General Electric Company, a joint venture partner, which was to buy 485 cells. [The shares ended Friday at $39.4375.]</p>
        <p>Multinational companies have largely been participating as investors and partners but some multinationals are more directly involved. The United Technologies Corporation owns International Fuel Cells of South Windsor, Conn., the developer of the fuel cells used on space missions and a stationary power system that has been installed in more than 200 commercial and institutional sites. And Siemens of Germany, with support from the Department of Energy, is field-testing a high-temperature hydrogen cell that could operate in tandem with gas turbines at power plants.</p>
        <p>Metallic Power, by contrast, is not scheduled to deliver its first testing prototypes to partners like Briggs &amp; Stratton and potential customers like the Army until the end of the year. Its more immediate goal is to complete a demonstration unit by July that will show how a portable cell for backup power can be kept running when fuel runs out simply by popping a new fuel cartridge in place. The target audience is venture capitalists; Metallic Power hopes to raise an additional $10 million to $15 million by the end of the year.</p>
        <p>At a recent staff meeting, Mr. Colborn and three other senior managers pored over a chart showing the breakdown of the fuel cell into scores of components. They pondered where weight could be cut by design changes. Weight was not a concern for the July goals, but promises had been made to Briggs and others about the year-end prototypes, and Mr. Colborn wanted assurances that the July unit could be finished without compromising delivery of the prototypes.</p>
        <p>Mr. Colborn is also juggling the demands of raising capital, nearly doubling his work force to about 50 by the end of the year and moving to larger quarters. He is determined to move methodically, arguing that in the turbulent world of fuel cells, Metallic Power is not as far behind the hydrogen companies as it looks if the finish line is defined as profitability.</p>
        <p>''They are ahead of us in what they've put in the field, but they are too expensive,'' he said, predicting that Metallic Power will be among the first to become profitable if it meets its goals of commercial sales in 2002.</p>
        <p>Mr. Colborn is quick to acknowledge, though, that the hydrogen cell designers are bringing down costs. ''Realistically,'' he said, ''the best thing that could happen for us is that they succeed -- but not a whole lot sooner than us.''</p>
