        <p>Reggie Miller's comments before the series notwithstanding, the Indiana Pacers do have some mushy feelings toward the Knicks.</p>
        <p>While the Pacers hate that the Knicks have been their bane of playoffs past, they are not beyond appreciating and admiring the work of New York's basketball gladiator, the one who has been every bit as long-suffering as they have been in his quest for a championship.</p>
        <p>For that reason, the Pacers hope to see Patrick Ewing in uniform and in action today at Madison Square Garden. Just before the game, it will be decided whether or not Ewing, who sprained his right ankle six minutes into Game 2 on Thursday, can play in Game 3.</p>
        <p>''I'd rather he played,'' Miller said yesterday after a light practice at John Jay College in Manhattan. ''He's a great warrior. He's been a great competitor throughout the years, so I hope he's suited up come Saturday. You always want the best players out on the floor to play.''</p>
        <p>Mark Jackson, who was mentored by Ewing while playing for the Knicks early in his career, said: ''Being a friend, I wish nothing but the best for him. It's to no benefit of mine to hope he's hurt and call myself a true friend. I hope he's fine and I hope he suits up.''</p>
        <p>The comments of the Pacers, whose sentiments were supported by their coach, Larry Bird, were made in all sincerity. But one can't help wondering if the Knicks' success against them without Ewing plays at least a small part in their desire to see him on the block, calling for the ball and wheeling for that turnaround jumper.</p>
        <p>Perhaps more than anyone, the Pacers, who lead this series, 2-0, are aware of how the Knicks can morph into a different, sleeker opponent when Ewing is sidelined.</p>
        <p>The Pacers became the unwitting victims of a speedy, daring Knicks team that no one knew existed after Ewing missed the final four games of last year's Eastern Conference championship with a partly torn Achilles' tendon.</p>
        <p>After Ewing went down with the series tied at one game apiece, the Knicks of Latrell Sprewell, Allan Houston, Larry Johnson and Marcus Camby beat the Pacers in three of four games.</p>
        <p>In fact, the Pacers somewhat remade themselves this season, trading away the bruising Antonio Davis in the off-season in an attempt to keep pace with the Knicks, who had overwhelmed Indiana with their athleticism once Ewing went out.</p>
        <p>While saying that the Pacers subconsciously let up after Ewing left the series, Miller acknowledged that the game became more difficult for him and his partner on the wing, Jalen Rose, when Ewing was not around.</p>
        <p>''We felt it was tougher last year,'' Miller said. ''I think we somewhat let our guard down when he went down. All it does is really put more pressure on Jalen and myself because we know Latrell and Allan will probably get 20 shots apiece now. I think now the team knows that the offense really is going to run through those two guys' hands.''</p>
        <p>Miller also said that Rik Smits, the Pacers' 33-year-old center who lumbers on bad feet, was better off playing against the equally cumbersome Ewing rather than against Kurt Thomas or Camby.</p>
        <p>''I think Rik would prefer to go against Patrick size-wise and age-wise,'' Miller said. ''They both move the same because they're up there in age. I think when you put a younger, more athletic -- and in Kurt Thomas a little bit more physical player -- on Rik, it kind of changes his game a little bit. He went from no fouls in the third quarter to picking up four quick fouls, so I think he's going to have to adjust a little bit.''</p>
        <p>Smits agreed, saying: ''I prefer playing Ewing. I've gotten to know him a lot better than the other guys.''</p>
        <p>The Pacers refused to say that the Knicks were better without Ewing, though.</p>
        <p>''They're not as good a basketball team without Patrick,'' Jackson said. ''No knock. But they're still a dangerous team. They're still a team that knocked us out last year without him. They do different things. We just have to adjust.''</p>
        <p>Whether Ewing plays or not, the Pacers said their mind would remain set on avenging the stunning defeat last year.</p>
        <p>''In my heart of hearts, I don't care if he plays,'' Rose said. ''I want to win the game. We've been down this road before with Patrick in, Patrick out. He is a tremendous warrior for their team, and I don't think they're a better team without him. Whatever it takes for us to win, though, I'll take it.''</p>
