        <p>Memorial Day heralds the coming of the dog days of summer, a harbinger of longer, warmer days. Vacation. The beach. Fourth of July picnics. And, as a friend of mine on the East Coast said, ''Things finally begin to slow down enough to actually leave the office early on a Friday.''</p>
        <p>We on the West Coast smile to ourselves at that last statement. We have a secret, hidden behind the Sierra Madres and buried beneath the San Andreas Fault. We don't wait for summer to taste the fruit of the four-and-a-half-day workweek.</p>
        <p>I encountered this phenomenon while a staff person for a member of Congress in San Francisco. I found it difficult to schedule meetings on Friday afternoons, or to get phone calls returned once placed on Friday mornings. People were ''unavailable'' or ''already booked'' or, more plaintively, asking, ''Can't you find another time?''</p>
        <p>This, I soon learned, is code for ''I'm at the beach'' or ''my flight to Vegas is nonrefundable'' or ''it's the only time I have with my masseuse.''</p>
        <p>It's difficult to pin down why. Recent statistics show that only one in three Californians holds a regular 9-to-5 job. Perhaps telecommuting, dot-commers and commutes that can stretch for hours render the hold of the traditional workweek increasingly irrelevant.</p>
        <p>The time difference can be another reason. For those who deal with the East Coast, 5 p.m. is only 2 p.m. here -- plenty of time to get a jump-start on the weekend. And if the East Coast leaves, say, by noon, what incentive is there for us to even get up for work?</p>
        <p>But it's more than that. Look at a baseball game. Whenever I watch a televised game at Yankee Stadium on a work night, I see hundreds -- perhaps thousands -- of people still in their business suits.</p>
        <p>In California, the only people in business attire are serving the beer. While fans in Midtown are working to the last minute and fighting their way onto the subway to the Bronx, the fans in California have changed clothes and, while sipping wine, are debating whether the Thai sausage on the grill is really more flavorful than a robust andouille.</p>
        <p>I write this piece not to insinuate that East Coasters are worker drones chained to their desks except during the summer lull, nor to imply that Californians are play-oriented irresolutes who escape responsibility as soon as any Friday rolls around. We work as hard as our East Coast brethren. Maybe we just look better doing it.</p>
        <p>That same Banana Republic-clad fan nibbling on sushi is checking voice and e-mail, returning calls. When my city's new baseball stadium opened last month, fans marveled at its ''old time'' feel.</p>
        <p>But the warm feelings quickly turned to frustration for many business people who discovered that the structure of the ballpark rendered their cell phones impotent.</p>
        <p>Don't blame us because we live surrounded by the temptations of paradise. Pity us because we are tied by electronic umbilical cords to employers, customers, clients and investors who are with us even when we're putting for birdie at Pebble Beach.</p>
        <p>I exaggerate when I say that we cut every Friday short.</p>
        <p>But given the opportunity or excuse, Californians will, no matter the season, jump in their cars, crank the stereo and head for hill, valley or beach on overcrowded freeways that force us to get on the road earlier and earlier.</p>
        <p>Even elected officials like myself, whose weekends are chockablock with scheduled events both day and night, are not immune to the siren's call. Sometimes, on the rare late Friday afternoon, you might hear an unfamiliar sound in the background of my cell phone. I'll leave it up to your imagination, but here's a hint: ''Fore!''</p>
