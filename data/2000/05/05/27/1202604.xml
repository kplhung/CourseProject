        <p>The violence and chaos of Zimbabwe cast a shadow on its neighbor these days. South Africa is an utterly different country, far more developed and sophisticated. But some in the West fear it will go down the same road.</p>
        <p>I asked South Africa's minister of finance, Trevor Manuel, what he would say to those doubters. What assurance is there that this country will not follow Robert Mugabe's path to lawlessness and autocracy?</p>
        <p>''We've got a very strong Constitution,'' Mr. Manuel said, ''and a very strong, fiercely independent Constitutional Court.</p>
        <p>''It is a Constitution that sets up a number of strong institutions. And many of those provisions came from the African National Congress. They weren't foisted on us.''</p>
        <p>From the first non-racial election, in 1994, the A.N.C. has dominated the government. But not long after that election President Nelson Mandela emphasized the supremacy of the Constitution and the court that interprets it.</p>
        <p>In 1995 the Constitutional Court held that President Mandela had acted unconstitutionally in making rules for a provincial election without parliamentary enabling legislation. Mr. Mandela, rather than protesting the decision, said it ''confirms that our new democracy is taking firm root. This is something of which we should be proud.''</p>
        <p>Will that spirit go on? I asked Mr. Manuel.</p>
        <p>''It will have to go on,'' he said. ''We lived in an environment, under apartheid, in which power was abused. The Constitution creates a sense of responsibility. We can't walk away from it.</p>
        <p>''The process of establishing democracy was an internal negotiating process, not under the aegis of a colonial power. And the moving spirit was, 'We're all going to have to live here together.' ''</p>
        <p>As an example of the institutions created and protected by the Constitution, Mr. Manuel pointed to the Reserve Bank of South Africa. The Constitution provides that it should act ''independently and without fear.'' ''Do I disagree sometimes with its monetary policy?'' Mr. Manuel asked. ''Yes.''</p>
        <p>A financial consultant with whom I spoke, Doug Band, had a similar view of the importance of the rule of law in keeping South Africa free and stable.</p>
        <p>''I've just been in Europe,'' he said. ''People talked about Zimbabwe and said it foretold what's going to happen in South Africa.</p>
        <p>''My answer was that we have a very strong Constitution -- and a democratic disposition. It would be hard to move toward dictatorship. There's an allegiance to law.</p>
        <p>''South Africa wants to be part of the world. The government well recognizes that if it doesn't show the world a real commitment to the rule of law, the game is up.''</p>
        <p>There are many indications of public respect for law as the foundation of the new South Africa. When an A.N.C. official allegedly charged that racial bias lay behind the conviction of a well-known figure, Allan Boesak, for corruption, many voices criticized him. A newspaper with a largely black readership, The Sowetan, said those critics ''must be supported.''</p>
        <p>But on the homelier level -- in terms of crime -- respect for law has a long way to go. The police, who under apartheid focused on political repression, remain severely inadequate. Mr. Manuel said changing the police had ''proved to be one of the most difficult problems.''</p>
        <p>Of course South Africa has profound problems. Unemployment is estimated to be as high as 50 percent. Job creation is an urgent economic need. Blacks were dispossessed of most of the country's land; events in Zimbabwe have led to increasing calls from both blacks and whites for orderly redistribution.</p>
        <p>But what is striking to a visitor is the sense of determination and optimism. Several people in the business community used those words, among them Bobby Godsell, the C.E.O. of Anglogold.</p>
        <p>I interviewed Mr. Manuel after he spoke to a high-powered economic group. The audience cheered when he said, ''The one thing we as South Africans need is to believe in our souls and our future.''</p>
