        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration should not have resumed ties with the Indonesian military (news article, May 24). Such ties reward the Indonesian military for its continuing abuse of the people of East Timor and Indonesia.</p>
        <p>Before the Indonesian military ended its occupation of East Timor in October, it and military-backed militias forced an estimated quarter of a million East Timorese into Indonesia. More than 100,000 refugees remain, many trapped inside camps where they are terrorized by the military and its militias and suffer from disease and malnutrition.</p>

        <p>Before the Indonesian military ended its occupation of East Timor in October, it and military-backed militias forced an estimated quarter of a million East Timorese into Indonesia. More than 100,000 refugees remain, many trapped inside camps where they are terrorized by the military and its militias and suffer from disease and malnutrition.</p>
        <p>The military and its militias also attack and infiltrate East Timor from across the border. In addition, the Indonesian military still represses and terrorizes people in Aceh, West Papua and other parts of Indonesia.</p>
        <p>Many Congressional members oppose the administration's resumption of military ties with Indonesia and have proposed legislation to prohibit these ties. Congress should pass it.</p>
