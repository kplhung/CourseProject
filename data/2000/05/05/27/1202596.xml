        <p>Op-ed article by Robert M Gates, former Director of Central Intelligence Agency, assesses United States national security problems, in light of General Accounting Office's disclosure this week that investigators with forged badges were able to gain entry into what are supposed to be some of most secure of federal agencies (M)</p>

        <p>There was surprisingly little shock when the General Accounting Office revealed this week that investigators with forged badges were able to gain entry into what are supposedly some of the most secure of federal agencies. It was, after all, only the latest in a series of similarly alarming stories about security lapses in the federal government.</p>
        <p>The holders of the phony badges were intentionally testing security at doorways of the Justice Department, Pentagon, C.I.A., F.B.I. and State Department. Earlier reports described security lapses including the bugging of a conference room and the theft of a laptop computer, loaded with highly classified information, at the State Department; allegations of misuse of nuclear weapons information at Los Alamos; and concerns about government officials flouting security regulations.</p>

        <p>There was surprisingly little shock when the General Accounting Office revealed this week that investigators with forged badges were able to gain entry into what are supposedly some of the most secure of federal agencies. It was, after all, only the latest in a series of similarly alarming stories about security lapses in the federal government.</p>
        <p>The holders of the phony badges were intentionally testing security at doorways of the Justice Department, Pentagon, C.I.A., F.B.I. and State Department. Earlier reports described security lapses including the bugging of a conference room and the theft of a laptop computer, loaded with highly classified information, at the State Department; allegations of misuse of nuclear weapons information at Los Alamos; and concerns about government officials flouting security regulations.</p>
        <p>What is going on? Did security discipline inside the United States government collapse along with the Soviet Union? Has technology, including the proliferation of computers, Internet access and e-mail, made security significantly harder to enforce? Is there a lack of concern about security among senior officials and a concomitant inadequacy of priority and resources?</p>
        <p>The answer to all of these questions would appear to be yes.</p>
        <p>Of course, security problems are nothing new. Espionage from abroad and violations of security rules at home were facts of life during the cold war and were found at virtually every department and agency possessing sensitive information. All too often, misuse of such information was attributable to senior officials.</p>
        <p>The technical problems in providing security are plainly more difficult than they were a decade or two ago. The material on a single floppy disk, carried out of a government building in a pocket, once would have required a wheelbarrow to purloin.  The Internet creates an opportunity to send secrets anywhere in the world without risky dead drops and brush passes. And there is the temptation to bypass the rules by transferring secret information to one's own computer for reasons as mundane as personal convenience.</p>
        <p>Still, new technological advances are naturally answered by new rules and monitoring techniques. As before, good security is primarily a matter of compliance with rules and procedures that already exist.</p>
        <p>A deeper change is atmospheric. In World War II and, to a somewhat lesser extent, during the cold war, there was a very real sense on the part of those with access to sensitive information that security really mattered because of the stakes involved in those struggles. This didn't stop a small number of Americans from spying for others and a much larger number from leaking secrets. Overall, though, there was more discipline, and more people cared, because we were in life and death conflicts and few wanted to give our adversaries any advantage.</p>
        <p>Apparently, the risks seem smaller now to many -- including not only people directly charged with protecting secrets, but those who control their budgets. As defense, intelligence and diplomatic budgets have shrunk, resources for security -- physical safety as well as protection of information -- often have been early victims of the budget axes.</p>
        <p>Perhaps most important, tone and attitude at the top are vital. From the outset of the current administration, whether by allowing people to work at the White House before security clearances were approved by the F.B.I. or showing indifference to and even disdain for security as a manifestation of a ''cold war mindset,'' a message has been sent that these issues are no longer very important.  Individual senior officials in various departments and agencies have reinforced that message, partly with arrogant attitudes conveying the idea that the rules do not apply to them.</p>
        <p>Good security still starts and ends with trust, integrity and seriousness of purpose. Agencies need more resources. But simply observing the rules that already exist, from the top down, would go a long way.  Robert M. Gates served on the National Security Council staff under four presidents and was director of the Central Intelligence Agency under President George Bush.</p>
