        <p>In so many ways, Coach Larry Robinson seems to have his motivational thumb on the psychic pulse of the Devils. When they trailed the Philadelphia Flyers by three games to one in the Eastern Conference finals, he screamed at the players and spurred their historic comeback.</p>
        <p>When the captain Scott Stevens felt depressed after injuring Eric Lindros with a big check in last night's first period, Robinson took him aside in the dressing room during the first intermission and counseled him to change his frame of mind.</p>
        <p>And when Patrik Elias scored twice to lead the Devils to a 2-1 victory that clinched the series and put the Devils in the Stanley Cup finals against either Dallas or Colorado, Robinson was grudging with his praise for the young winger. It was good that Elias scored, Robinson said, but it would be better if he went to the net more often. That way, Robinson said, he would get even more goals. With another series to worry about, Robinson does not want any player becoming complacent with his success.</p>
        <p>Last night's victory came in a tense, taut game that concluded a grinding, grueling series. Along with big hits by Stevens and big goals by Elias, the Devils got a brilliant recovery from Martin Brodeur, the goalie who slumped badly early in the series and then gradually returned to top form. Brodeur gave credit to the coach, particularly for his angry speech after Game 4.</p>
        <p>''What he told us was coming from his heart,'' Brodeur said. ''It touched a lot of players's feelings. He's really nice to be around. It's easy to play hockey for him. It was great for him to spit it out. Sometimes, coaches have a hard time getting their messages through. But he did.''</p>
        <p>Brodeur said the Devils entered the tournament ''with zero confidence'' because they slumped in the fourth quarter of the season. Robinson replaced the fired Robbie Ftorek with eight games remaining. His team eliminated Florida in four games, Toronto in six and Philadelphia in seven.</p>
        <p>''Now, we have a chance to play for the Stanley Cup,'' Brodeur said. ''It's really rewarding.''</p>
        <p>When the Devils first reached the Stanley Cup finals, in their championship season of 1995, Robinson was Jacques Lemaire's top assistant, the nice cop to Lemaire's tough cop. After four unspectacular seasons as head coach of the Los Angeles Kings, Robinson returned to New Jersey this season to assist Ftorek.</p>
        <p>Robinson was reluctant to take over. But he did as he was told. After Robinson's outburst, Stevens said Robinson's mood changed quickly.</p>
        <p>''Back to the Larry we know, the Larry we want to see more of,'' Stevens said. ''Because he is such a great guy and good to everyone, everyone respects him. You want to play for a guy like Larry because he is a players' coach. We snapped to right back where we should be. We had to or else we were going to die together.''</p>
        <p>Scott Gomez said players ''knew it was coming from the heart when Larry screamed at us because he's not a yeller.</p>
        <p>''When you see a guy like Larry Robinson spilling his heart out to you, we didn't take it as 'What's with this guy? We've tried our best.' Because we didn't. So we really appreciated it.''</p>
        <p>Robinson said the pressure of Game 7 in this round might have a positive effect, particularly on a roster with four rookies -- Gomez, John Madden, Colin White and Brian Rafalski -- and several young veterans like Elias.</p>
        <p>''We're growing as players and as persons also, all together,'' Elias said. He was speaking of his linemates, Petr Sykora and Jason Arnott, but his words applied to many others. Regarding Robinson's speech, Elias said: ''I looked deep down in myself, if I was doing my best. What could I do better?'' When asked what he discovered, Elias said: ''We were working hard, but maybe not working smart.</p>
        <p>Robinson, speaking of Game 7 pressure, said: ''As far as the young kids, it's something they are going to remember for the rest of their lives. A lot of times, it takes players from one level to another level just because of the intensity and the importance of the game.''</p>
        <p>Referring to ''my tirade,'' Robinson said: ''I knew we were a better team than we were showing.'' When someone asked Robinson ''What does this accomplishment mean to you personally?'' the coach snapped back a reply.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't mean a thing,'' he said. ''This is about those 24 guys that have to go on the ice every day and sweat and take pucks in the mouth and get their heads banged against the wall. It's about the team.''</p>
        <p>And the team is four victories away from another cup. They showered, dressed their wounds and boarded the bus for their final trip up the turnpike of this round. Before the final period, Stevens had told his teammates: ''Let's make this the best bus ride home.'' Afterward, Stevens said: ''We're going to have a heck of a bus ride home.''</p>
