        <p>The abortion debate has gotten murkier in recent years as pro-life forces have shifted their strategy. Whereas once they were focused on wholesale repudiation of Roe v. Wade, they are now finding it more productive to chip away at a woman's right to choose by imposing limitations. One result has been to blur the meaning of ''pro-choice.''</p>
        <p>A good example of this confusion is the Senate race in New York between Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative Rick Lazio. Both call themselves pro-choice. But they differ significantly on how far government should go in limiting choice.</p>
        <p>This new fuzziness shows how successful pro-life forces have been in limiting abortion rights one restriction at a time. Even politicians who consider themselves pro-choice wind up siding with pro-life groups by, for example, endorsing laws that mandate waiting periods and parental notification. But the pro-life camp's most important victory has been on the so-called partial birth abortion ban.</p>
        <p>By seeming to target a single procedure that sounds particularly distasteful, pro-life strategists have won support for partial birth legislation from a broad range of politicians, including Republicans like Gov. George Pataki of New York who are generally pro-choice, and even pro-choice Democrats like Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Tom Daschle, the Senate minority leader.</p>
        <p>That may be because the partial birth ban is frequently mis-advertised as dealing only with a rare procedure used in late-term abortions. In fact, the language of partial birth legislation in Congress and in most of the statutes adopted by some 30 states is so vague that it could potentially apply even to common procedures used before viability of the fetus. That is why such laws have been blocked  by nearly every federal and state court that has reviewed them.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lazio says he is an abortion rights supporter, but he too favors the partial birth abortion ban and has described Mrs. Clinton as extreme for opposing it. He has also voted for other restrictions, like prohibiting women in the military from obtaining privately funded abortions at overseas military hospitals and subjecting to criminal prosecution anyone other than a parent who accompanies a minor across state lines for an abortion in violation of parental consent laws.</p>
        <p>The top three Republican candidates in the Senate race in New Jersey also call themselves pro-choice though all support the partial birth ban, a stance that allows them to reach out to moderate voters without angering pro-life groups. This may be smart politics. Other politicians who have refused to back the partial birth ban have made enemies politically, among them New York's mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Voters are going to have to be alert this year to the nuances of the abortion issue. There are candidates out there who promise to support a woman's right to choose, but whose commitment is compromised by their willingness to accept more government intrusion into private medical decisions.</p>
