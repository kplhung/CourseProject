        <p>BUSH BYPASSES TEXAS CONVENTION -- Gov. George W. Bush will skip the Texas Republican Party convention in Houston next month. The decision, reported in The Houston Chronicle on Friday, has prompted speculation that the decision grew out of skirmishes with conservative elements of the party, but Bush campaign aides insisted otherwise. ''The governor will be campaigning in Florida and Kentucky at that time,'' said Ray Sullivan, a campaign spokesman in Austin. ''But Laura Bush is planning to address the convention as his representative.'' Mr. Sullivan denied that there were any lingering problems with anti-abortion elements of the party that, during the 1996 Texas convention, stripped Mr. Bush of a governor's traditional role as leader of the state delegation to the national convention.</p>

        <p>NEIGHBORLY ADVICE -- Crawford High School in Crawford, Texas, had never had a commencement speaker until Gov. George W. Bush volunteered, choosing the Friday night event to say hello to his new neighbors. The Texas governor last year bought a ranch -- expected to be a sort of Western White House if he is elected -- about 7 miles west of Crawford, 115 miles southwest of Dallas. In his talk, Mr. Bush gave the 45 graduates some advice, including, ''I've learned that no matter how old you are or how important your job is you can never escape your mother.''</p>

        <p>THE SENATE</p>
        <p>A CAMPAIGN AGAINST GORTON -- Several Indian groups have advertisements planned that criticize Senator Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington, who is up for re-election, The Seattle Post-Intelligencer has reported. Mr. Gorton has long feuded with some tribes over fishing rights and sovereignty issues. The Indian groups said they expected to spend $1 million or more, with some of the money coming from tribes with gambling casinos in other states. Ron Allen, chairman of a tribe on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington, called Mr. Gorton ''the most vociferous opponent of tribal sovereignty that Congress has seen in 40 years.'' Mr. Gorton told The Post-Intelligencer: ''They have a total right to do what they want in the political world. I have a very good record on supporting the appropriate ambitions of Indian peoples, but I will continue to fiercely protect the rights of their non-Indian neighbors. If they don't like that, they have every right to try to beat me. They are not going to succeed.''</p>

        <p>ELECTION COMPLAINT IN NEVADA -- The Nevada Republican Party has filed a complaint with the Federal Election Commission over advertisements by a lawyer who is running for the Senate as a Democrat. The television and billboard advertisements do not mention the candidacy of the lawyer, Ed Bernstein, but focus instead on his law practice. But state Republican leaders say Mr. Bernstein's intention is to gain an unfair advantage over his opponent, Representative John Ensign. The Republicans say the promotions amount to illegal campaign contributions from his law firm. ''Bernstein has officially filed with the secretary of state and the F.E.C., however, his face remains on corporate-financed billboards across Nevada and his law firm commercials continue to air touting him as a caring person,'' said Ryan Erwin, executive director of Nevada's Republican Party. Mr. Bernstein said the advertisements have no connection to the campaign. The latest billboard, with a legal assistant saying ''Ed Bernstein cares,'' went up this week.</p>
