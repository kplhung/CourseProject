      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>In the last year the Internet has bred its own school of do-it-yourself mass entertainment in the form of Flash animation, a relatively easy-to-use software tool that has made online animators out of novices.  Many of these shorts are amateurish, sophomoric or extremely slow-moving, but there are exceptions. One is ''Zombie College,'' which for this critic has made the Internet a rival to television. Nearly every Wednesday (sometimes there are Internet reruns), a new episode of ''Zombie College'' pops up on the powerhouse animation site www .icebox.com, which has amassed a team of producers and writers associated with television programs like ''The Simpsons,'' ''King of the Hill,'' ''Seinfeld'' and ''X-Files.''</p>
        <p>Most Flash animation programs run just a few minutes and either merge the chills of a science-fiction cliffhanger with the warm charm of a stuffed animal or, for the adolescent male, offer interactive superhero stories. The programs lean toward the bizarre and conceptual -- an extraterrestrial implanted with the brain of a redneck, a freckled prepubescent pimp, a monkey and chicken working for NASA -- but at the same time the plots are often light and about everyday life. (Flash animation sites include www .mediatrip.com, www.campchaos .com, www.shockwave.com, www.spumco.com and hotwired .lycos.com/animation.)</p>

        <p>In the last year the Internet has bred its own school of do-it-yourself mass entertainment in the form of Flash animation, a relatively easy-to-use software tool that has made online animators out of novices.  Many of these shorts are amateurish, sophomoric or extremely slow-moving, but there are exceptions. One is ''Zombie College,'' which for this critic has made the Internet a rival to television. Nearly every Wednesday (sometimes there are Internet reruns), a new episode of ''Zombie College'' pops up on the powerhouse animation site www .icebox.com, which has amassed a team of producers and writers associated with television programs like ''The Simpsons,'' ''King of the Hill,'' ''Seinfeld'' and ''X-Files.''</p>
        <p>Most Flash animation programs run just a few minutes and either merge the chills of a science-fiction cliffhanger with the warm charm of a stuffed animal or, for the adolescent male, offer interactive superhero stories. The programs lean toward the bizarre and conceptual -- an extraterrestrial implanted with the brain of a redneck, a freckled prepubescent pimp, a monkey and chicken working for NASA -- but at the same time the plots are often light and about everyday life. (Flash animation sites include www .mediatrip.com, www.campchaos .com, www.shockwave.com, www.spumco.com and hotwired .lycos.com/animation.)</p>
        <p>''Zombie College'' revolves around a pair of high school lovers, Scott and Zelda (the Fitzgerald allusion stops there), who are leaving for their freshman year of college. Scott turns down admission to M.I.T. so he can join his loved one at Arkford University, also known as Zombie College, an integrated school where living students warily mingle with undead ones (the civil rights allusion stops there) who eat human brains. The story begins when Zelda tells Scott she wants to start seeing other men, leaving the sensitive genius Scott stranded in the ''Revenge of the Nerds''-like world of a zombie fraternity house.</p>
        <p>Pretty silly, but in the hands of its creator, Eric Kaplan (a producer of ''Futurama''), and the animation director, John Rice (''The Simpsons,'' ''King of the Hill''), ''Zombie College'' comes to life. The music is original and catchy, the characters are animated with depth and personality, the voices are believable and effective, the plot is relentless and irresistible, and, most important, every episode is smart and funny. Each week the story takes unexpected twists and turns until, at the end of the program's four minutes, one is left wondering how Mr. Kaplan is going to get his characters out of the corner he's painted them into.</p>
        <p>In the great Internet sweepstakes, well-financed sites like Icebox have been racing to mine what they call content from an entertainment world in which everyone seems to be available to the highest bidder. This often results in well-known names' being given tantalizing stock packages to put any old thing -- a throwaway song, 200 words of text, a minute-long interview snippet, a photograph of an old sock -- on a Web site to make it attractive to investors.</p>
        <p>But in the rush for content, entertainment is getting brushed aside, a nuisance to deal with at some future date. ''Zombie College,'' however, is a world crafted with care, in which the quirkily drawn zombies are capable of sucking your brains out as quickly as a Sunday night of prime-time animation on Fox.</p>
