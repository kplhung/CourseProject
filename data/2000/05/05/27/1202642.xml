        <p>In the last televised debate of the New Jersey primary for United States Senate, the four Republican candidates cordially discussed their differences on gun control, school vouchers and foreign affairs today, saving their criticism for their two Democratic opponents.</p>
        <p>But in a sign of the changing dynamics of the race, the Democrat who received more condemnation was Jon S. Corzine, whose $30 million in campaign spending has shattered  records for a Senate candidate.</p>
        <p>Until this week, Republicans had aimed almost exclusively at Mr. Corzine's Democratic opponent, Jim Florio. Most recent polls now show Mr. Corzine leading the Democratic race, however, and with Mr. Corzine's record-breaking spending on the front pages of many New Jersey newspapers, the Republicans have apparently changed targets.</p>
        <p>One of the Republican contenders, James W. Treffinger, the Essex County executive, declared in today's debate that Mr. Corzine's spending was ''obscene.''</p>
        <p>Representative Robert D. Franks ridiculed Mr. Corzine's calls for expansive new social programs. He said the programs were out of touch with New Jerseyans because they would be so expensive as to require a tax increase.</p>
        <p>''We simply can't afford it,'' Mr. Franks said. ''We're all not as wealthy as Jon Corzine.''</p>
        <p>Asked whether he would support tighter campaign spending laws, including a limit on the total amount a candidate could spend, William L. Gormley, a Republican state senator  from Atlantic County, predicted that Mr. Corzine's campaign would disgust the public.</p>
        <p>''I bet the people of New Jersey are going to put a limit on that personal fortune,'' Mr. Gormley said.</p>
        <p>Only Murray Sabrin, the former Libertarian who is now running for the Republican nomination, did not object to Mr. Corzine's campaign spending. Mr. Sabrin said he also opposed any limits on campaign contributions because he considers such restrictions an infringement on the freedom of speech.</p>
        <p>The debate was sponsored by the League of Women Voters and is scheduled to be broadcast at 3 p.m. Saturday and 10 a.m. Sunday on WPVI in Philadelphia and WABC in New York. The league had also invited the Democratic candidates to hold a separate debate to be televised on network television, and Mr. Florio accepted. But Mr. Corzine declined, so the Democratic debate was canceled.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Gormley and Mr. Franks are the two best-known candidates, the only polls available show that at least 40 percent of likely Republican primary voters are undecided.</p>
        <p>The format of today's debate consisted of a panel of journalists who asked questions of each candidate. But candidates were not allowed to rebut one another or ask one another questions, so the tone of the discourse was tame, almost to the point of courtliness.</p>
        <p>All four candidates said they supported the death penalty, a plan to invest some Social Security funds in the stock market, and expanded trade relations with China. Mr. Franks, Mr. Gormley and Mr. Treffinger also said that Gov. Christine Todd Whitman, who has not endorsed a primary candidate, deserved praise for her efforts to stop racial profiling by the New Jersey State Police. Mr. Sabrin tried to turn that question into a denunciation of affirmative action, which he called ''the ultimate form of racial profiling,'' and urging his colleagues to state their position on the policy.</p>
        <p>But the issue was not raised again.</p>
        <p>Mr. Franks, the only Republican contender who has served in Washington, often cited his Congressional experience.</p>
        <p>Asked about taxes, he took credit for helping to write the balanced budget and for forcing President Clinton ''kicking and screaming down the path to fiscal responsibility.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gormley, who appeared the most relaxed of all the candidates, continued to emphasize his strong support of gun control legislation, an unusual tactic in a Republican primary. Mr. Gormley also sought to stress opposition to the fiscal policies Mr. Florio carried out as governor because Mr. Franks's campaign literature has accused him of being a ''Florio Republican.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Treffinger, a former Democrat, portrayed himself as the candidate best able to broaden the Republican Party's appeal. Citing his record at trimming Essex County's budget and his support of vouchers for private schools, Mr. Treffinger said he could help Republicans win back the working-class voters who now identify with Democrats. ''We Republicans represent the working families,'' Mr. Treffinger said, ''and more importantly, we represent the forgotten Americans.''</p>
