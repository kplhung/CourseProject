        <p>The ball and home-court advantage in the Western conference finals rested in Arvydas Sabonis's hands as the seconds ticked away in Game 3 tonight. With Shaquille O'Neal jumping out to contest the game-tying shot, the Portland Trail Blazers' chances rested on their center's lumbering drive to the basket.</p>
        <p>The 7-foot-3-inch Sabonis was met by the 6-7 Kobe Bryant, and with one swat, Bryant preserved a 93-91 victory and put the Los Angeles Lakers ahead, two games to one, in this four-of-seven-game series. Game 4 is Sunday at the Rose Garden.</p>
        <p>As the horn sounded, the stunned Trail Blazers begged for a foul, but they had only themselves to blame. After taking a 10-point halftime lead, they lost momentum and fell behind by 9 points with seven minutes to play. They rallied, but Ron Harper's jump shot with 29.9 seconds left proved to be the game-winning basket.</p>
        <p>Replays clearly showed that Bryant, who finished with 25 points and 7 rebounds, blocked the ball and did not foul Sabonis. In hindsight, Sabonis should probably have taken the 15-foot jump shot. ''He wouldn't have been able to take it,'' said O'Neal, who had a 26 points and 12 rebounds, both game highs. ''I was on the fly, and I was high.''</p>
        <p>''He hit Sabonis,'' Scottie Pippen said. ''But that was it. We didn't get the call. The officials just aren't going to call it in that situation.''</p>
        <p>Faced with their fourth road loss in five playoff games, the Lakers regained their composure in the second half after falling behind by as many as 13 points in the first half.</p>
        <p>Trailing, 87-79, the Trail Blazers countered with their own comeback and pulled within 87-85 on Pippen's 3-pointer with 3 minutes 35 seconds to play.</p>
        <p>Indeed, the home court might be no advantage in this series. Both teams won on each other's court during the regular season, and the same has happened in the playoffs.</p>
        <p>''This tightens things up now,'' Lakers Coach Phil Jackson said. ''We got our home court back, and we got another notch in our belt. Sunday we'll have to fight hard again. Portland knows that it's at death's door if it doesn't win Sunday.''</p>
        <p>The game and series swung toward the Lakers in the fourth quarter. They took off on an 11-3 run for a 83-74 lead with 7:23 to play. Portland's frustration boiled over into an altercation between Pippen and the Lakers reserve Rick Fox. Both players squared off and were assessed technicals, but momentum was clearly with Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>After leading by 12 points early in the third quarter, the Trail Blazers began to fade. The Lakers finally caught them at 65-65 on A. C. Green's jump shot with 2:47 left in the quarter. One possession earlier, Bryant slid a pretty back-door bounce pass to Harper under the basket to pull the Lakers within two points.</p>
        <p>The Lakers grabbed their first lead at 69-67 on Harper's two free throws. Both teams traded baskets and the lead in the final two minutes of the third quarter, until O'Neal's two free throws put the Lakers ahead, 72-71.</p>
        <p>Amid the raucous atmosphere of the Rose Garden, the Lakers slowly built second-half momentum. Trailing, 61-49, early in the third quarter, they reeled off 8 straight points. Harper capped the run with an acrobatic shot while plowing into Pippen and sending his former Chicago Bulls teammate sprawling across the floor.</p>
        <p>At the end, Portland had returned the home-court advantage.</p>
        <p>''We're in a situation now where we've got to win,'' Portland Coach Mike Dunleavy said. ''We expected the outcome to be different, but we didn't get any breaks at the end.''</p>
        <p>Damon Stoudamire and Rasheed Wallace led the Trail Blazers with 19 points each. Portland received a huge boost off the bench from Stacey Augmon, who blindsided the Lakers with 8 points in eight minutes of the second quarter. Augmon, who had taken only one shot in the first two games, made 4 of 6 shots.</p>
