        <p>A seventh grader shot and killed a teacher today on the last day of school after he had been sent home for throwing water balloons in class, the police in this Palm Beach County city said.</p>
        <p>The boy returned at the close of the last period of the school year and shot the teacher, Barry Grunow, once in the head with a small .25-caliber handgun, the authorities reported.</p>
        <p>''He shot Mr. Grunow! He shot Mr. Grunow!'' some children cried after the shooting shattered the midafternoon buzz of children preparing to depart for summer vacation.</p>
        <p>The body of the popular 35-year-old language arts teacher and basketball coach at Lake Worth Middle School was found in a puddle of blood in the hallway.</p>
        <p>In a scene all too commonplace on American school grounds, wailing children were locked in classrooms by frightened teachers, police officers rushed to the school in well-rehearsed deployments to cope with school violence and parents gathered in weeping knots at a school entrance to await news about their own children.</p>
        <p>The suspect, identified as 13-year old Nathaniel Brazill, flagged down an officer headed to the scene and surrendered minutes after the shooting, about one-quarter mile north of the school.</p>
        <p>Chief William Smith of the Lake Worth Police Department said the boy was carrying a .25-caliber Raven semiautomatic pistol with three bullets in it. A single spent cartridge was recovered at the shooting scene.</p>
        <p>Chief Smith said the boy had taken the pistol a week ago from a dresser drawer in the home of his grandfather, who owned it.</p>
        <p>The chief called the gun a ''typical Saturday night special.''</p>
        <p>Chief Smith said the boy would be sent to a juvenile center for assessment and would appear before a circuit court judge for a hearing on Saturday morning. The state attorney's office in Palm Beach County will determine what charges will be filed and whether the boy will be charged as an adult.</p>
        <p>The boy's grandmother Eberlena Josey said that Nathaniel had returned from school early and ''seemed upset,'' but that he gave no indication of what was wrong or of his plans. Ms. Josey accompanied her daughter, the boy's mother, to police headquarters for questioning. She said her daughter was recovering from recent cancer surgery.</p>
        <p>''I thought he was the best boy,'' the grandmother said. ''He was good.''</p>
        <p>Nathaniel earned A's and B's and had perfect attendance, said Nat Harrington, a spokesman for the school board.</p>
        <p>''He had no problems of any kind, prior to this,'' Mr. Harrington said.</p>
        <p>The police said Nathaniel was not in Mr. Grunow's classroom when the balloon incident took place. The boy was sent home by an assistant principal.</p>
        <p>The police said the boy rode his bicycle home and got the pistol, and then returned to school. He went to Mr. Grunow's class, where he asked to see two students. Mr. Grunow stepped into the hall and would not let him enter.</p>
        <p>The shooting happened quickly afterward, the police said.</p>
        <p>''There is not one shred of evidence that he planned to do this,''  Chief Smith said.</p>
        <p>Children who witnessed the shooting said the boy returned to the school shortly after 3 p.m. as classes were about to be dismissed for the school year.</p>
        <p>They said he produced a handgun as he, Mr. Grunow and another teacher faced each other in the hall outside the classroom.</p>
        <p>'' 'Nat, quit playing, it's not funny anymore,' '' one of the children recalled the other teacher saying.</p>
        <p>Another student quoted the boy as saying, '' 'Get away from me or I'll shoot you, too.' ''</p>
        <p>Ben Marlin, superintendent of Palm Beach County schools, said, ''This is the biggest nightmare any school system could possibly face.''</p>
        <p>At a late afternoon news conference, Mr. Marlin faced questions from reporters about whether tighter security measures would be introduced in county schools because of today's shooting. ''We already have good school security,'' said Mr. Marlin, who was attending another school's graduation when he was notified of the incident.</p>
        <p>''I can't think of anything more we can do,'' he said. ''We do as much as we think we can do, probably even more.''</p>
        <p>''Unfortunately we can't control society's problems,'' he continued, pausing for a moment before adding: ''Perhaps one thing we can do is turn off the TV when all we do is see violence and hear violence.''</p>
        <p>The Florida Legislature, in the wake of numerous shootings in American schools in recent years, recently passed legislation requiring schools in the state to prepare disaster response plans. The school system said counselors would be available this weekend to assist students and teachers.</p>
        <p>Family members and friends linked arms as they walked slowly, heads bowed and sobbing, into the house where Mr. Grunow lived with his wife, 5-year-old son and newborn baby.</p>
