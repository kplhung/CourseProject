        <p>Although Glen Sather insists that he is biding his time, it is apparent that he and the Rangers are in the final stages of a deal that would make him the Rangers' new president and general manager.</p>
        <p>Several National Hockey League officials confirmed yesterday that the only issue remaining in the talks was compensation.</p>
        <p>One league official said the Rangers were offering Sather $11 million over five years. Sather is asking for $15 million over five years, the official said. Stock options in Cablevision, which owns the Rangers, the Knicks and Madison Square Garden, are also believed to be part of any deal.</p>
        <p>''There's no deal,'' Sather said yesterday.</p>
