        <p>For some of the smartest high school students in New York City, this Memorial Day weekend will not be the carefree interlude of splashing at the beach and picnics with family and friends that they envisioned just a few days ago.</p>
        <p>Instead, they will be studying for and worrying about their Advanced Placement calculus test -- again.</p>
        <p>On Thursday, 84 students at Benjamin N. Cardozo High School in Bayside, Queens, were told that their answer booklets for Section II -- the problem-solving part -- of the Advanced Placement test they took on May 15 had spilled out of a damaged box on the truck ride from Queens to Princeton, N.J., headquarters of the Educational Testing Service.</p>
        <p>Officials for the testing service offered devastated and angry students at Cardozo three options: retaking Section II; allowing the testing service to extrapolate from the scores for Section I, the multiple-choice section, to create a score for Section II; or forgetting the whole thing and getting a refund of the $76 test fee.</p>
        <p>But for many students, none of those options were compensation for the agony stirred by the lost answers. They had hired tutors, let easier subjects slide and pulled all-nighters preparing for the Calculus BC test -- reputed to be the hardest in the Advanced Placement repertory. Now, they said, they were being asked to gamble it all away on a retest they had not expected to take.</p>
        <p>''I am so mad,'' said Seeun Yoon, an 18-year-old senior, standing on the steps of Cardozo at dismissal time yesterday. ''E.T.S. is a monopoly like Bill Gates and Microsoft.''</p>
        <p>At the very least, Ms. Yoon and other students said, the testing service should give them their scores on Section I, so they can make an informed decision about whether to take Section II.</p>
        <p>Ms. Yoon's friend Erica Hom sobbed when she heard the news, wondering how she could handle her job at the Gap and her final exams while retaking the calculus test. ''I was crying,'' she said. ''A whole year's work is gone.''</p>
        <p>She attacked the testing service for planning to grade the Cardozo students the same way it would grade any other class of high school students in the country. ''It is wrong for them not to take responsibility,'' she said. ''Our whole mind-set is gone. We're thinking about graduation and college. How can you compare us to the other kids whose scores were not lost?''</p>
        <p>After at first saying that it would be irregular for the students to see the results of Section I before any retest, Tom Ewing, a spokesman for the testing service, called a reporter back to say the company might consider such a possibility.</p>
        <p>''We'll be back in touch with school officials bright and early Tuesday morning and continue to discuss the options,'' Mr. Ewing said. ''It's not out of the realm of possibility.''</p>
        <p>Company officials yesterday denied responsibility for the foulup, blaming Federal Express. Mr. Ewing said that a shipment of eight boxes of test answer booklets had left Cardozo on May 15, arranged for and paid for by the testing service. All eight boxes arrived in Princeton two days later, he said, but one box was damaged. Of the 117 booklets, each the size of a comic book, packed in the box, only 33 remained, he said.</p>
        <p>But Federal Express said its tracking records showed that the box of answer booklets had been signed for by the testing service on May 17, with no complaints of damage. Indeed, Federal Express said, there was no record of any complaint until yesterday, a week after the box was delivered to the testing service and three days after the service told Cardozo of the problem.</p>
        <p>''Our records are showing that the package was delivered on time and with no issues noted,'' Carla Boyd, a spokeswoman for Federal Express, said yesterday.</p>
        <p>If the booklets show up before the retest next Thursday, Mr. Ewing said, they will be counted. But if they show up after, they will be voided.</p>
        <p>Kimberly Wong, 17, said she had an economics final coming up and was worried that retaking the calculus test would make it hard to do well on either of them. But Doug Fath, 18, tried to be stoic. ''It's summertime, a three-day weekend, and we have to study,'' he said. ''What are we going to do?''</p>
        <p>A teacher at Cardozo said many students were upset because Section II of the calculus test was ''significantly easier'' than Section I, and they had counted on using it to increase their scores.</p>
        <p>The students who choose to retake the test will be taking a different version, Mr. Ewing said, so that there will be no advantage.</p>
        <p>It was important for the students to have their Advanced Placement scores count. Some colleges give course credit for Advanced Placement tests, allowing students to graduate early or save on tuition, which is especially meaningful, a teacher said, for the working-class and immigrant students who attend Cardozo. The teacher spoke on the condition that she not be named, saying she feared reprisal from the Board of Education for speaking out. Cardozo is one of the city's most academically rigorous schools, and hundreds of students there take  Advanced Placement tests, from macroeconomics to English to statistics.</p>
        <p>Rick Hallman, the principal of Cardozo, said, ''We just want the students to get their right scores.''</p>
        <p>Last year, 884 students took the Advanced Placement calculus exams in New York City high schools, said Margie Feinberg, a spokeswoman for the Board of Education.</p>
