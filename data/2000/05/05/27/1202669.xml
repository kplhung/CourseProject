        <p>Just minutes after a group of subtly confident Knicks took their places on the court to begin preparing for a dramatic re-enactment of last year's Eastern Conference finals, a black limousine eased into the parking lot of the team's practice facility.</p>
        <p>Patrick Ewing unfolded his body, emerged from behind the tinted windows and walked with normal strides as a security guard ushered him inside. Unlike last year on the day after Game 2 against Indiana, he wasn't wearing an ominous cast as an accessory. Today, a partly disquieted but mostly relieved Ewing was fresh from a magnetic resonance imaging test that revealed neither a tear nor a rupture. The pain in his sore right foot, which caused him to exit the floor six minutes into Game 2 on Thursday night in Indiana, was diagnosed as acute peroneal tendinitis.</p>
        <p>Although the injury does not generate the same grave reaction as the partly torn Achilles' tendon that ended Ewing's season last year, the Knicks have no idea when and if their center will return during a four-of-seven-game series that the Pacers lead, two games to none. A decision on whether Ewing will return for Saturday's Game 3 at Madison Square Garden will be made just before tip-off.</p>
        <p>''I'm going to ice it all day today, get treatment, and re-evaluate it tomorrow,'' said Ewing, who believes he injured his foot when he pump-faked Dale Davis at the 5-minute-20-second mark of the first quarter. ''It's a little better than it was last night. Last night I could hardly walk. I'm able to walk around a little better.</p>
        <p>''If the pain is bearable, I think I'll be fine. But if not, I won't be playing.''</p>
        <p>If that is the case, Kurt Thomas will most likely slip into the starter's role. And if Ewing is on the bench, the Knicks will quickly find out if their serendipitous trip through the conference finals last year was just a special and singular occasion or an us-against-the-world performance that can be duplicated.</p>
        <p>''We won last year without Patrick,'' Charlie Ward said. ''Nothing is going to shake us. It's the same situation, same scenario.''</p>
        <p>But there is one pivotal difference this year. The Knicks did not split the first two games, they dropped both. Their margin for error is microscopic. And the pressure is much more intense. If Ewing does not play, the miracle workers from last year will have to perform. Can the team's remaining low-post threat, Larry Johnson, find his same 3-point touch? Can Allan Houston and Latrell Sprewell re-create their inspirational play? Will Marcus Camby begin finishing with the same force around the basket?</p>
        <p>The Pacers have already put a dent into the Knicks' ability to answer those questions. In two games, Ewing's co-stars have struggled. To be more effective, Houston cannot continue to be lured into the kind of foul trouble that has reduced his playing time to 34 minutes against Indiana. Although he is faced with the flop-happy Reggie Miller, a crafty guard who can look like a bird crashing into a glass pane at the slightest contact, Houston has to play smarter.</p>
        <p>''I have to be aggressive and more assertive, but when you get offensive fouls because he's flopping, that's hard,'' Houston said. ''I just want it to be called both ways. But I'm not going to do the antics he does.''</p>
        <p>Miller does seem to major in theater. And it has gotten the best of the Knicks beyond Houston.</p>
        <p>''He's going to make it look like you put a gun to him and shot him,'' said Sprewell, who also picks up Miller on occasion. ''Marcus Camby barely touched him on a flagrant foul call last night, and he's so good, he's on the floor. You'd think Marcus killed him. He's good at it.''</p>
        <p>Miller is not the only foul magnet, though. Over two games, the Pacers have taken 50 attempts -- 14 alone by Jalen Rose -- compared with 35 for the Knicks. Down the stretch of Game 2, the Pacers wisely made their way to the free-throw line while the Knicks lost loose balls, became jump shot-oriented and blew the game.</p>
        <p>Sprewell was part of the problem. He was 0 for 4 in the fourth quarter. Over the last 10 playoff games, he is a troublesome 4 for 31 in the fourth. For the Knicks to have a chance without Ewing, Sprewell has to decode the mystery to his late-game disappearance.</p>
        <p>''I'm very aware of it,'' said Sprewell, whose last miss of Game 2 came on a made-to-order, game-tying jumper over the 5-foot-11-inch Travis Best with 5.8 seconds left. ''You're not thinking about it when you're playing, but right now, of course -- you're wondering what's going on. But again, like that last shot, you can't let that stuff affect you and how you play.</p>
        <p>''You have to block all of that stuff out, and say, hey, no matter what happens, even if I do play bad offensively, I have to do what I can defensively. Even if you don't shoot well, it doesn't mean you can't have an effective game.''</p>
        <p>Impact is everything. Last year Camby was a weightless wonder as he hovered above the court's surface and turned missed shots into emphatic dunks. In two games, he has been beaten on the perimeter by Austin Croshere, lost loose balls to Davis and put key fouls on Rik Smits. All the while, he has treated offensive rebounds as delicate as egg shells instead of dunk chances. As a result, he's 5 for 16 against Indiana.</p>
        <p>''I'm not as well as last year,'' said Camby, who has had a sore knee for two months. ''My explosion, my jumping ability is not there, evidently, or I'd have been dunking a lot of those shots I've been missing.''</p>
        <p>If Ewing is absent on Saturday, Camby and the cast from last year will have a lot of work ahead of them to recapture the magic. Do they have a 4-point play in the bag?</p>
        <p>''I don't want no miracle plays,'' Ward said. ''I don't want to wait until the last minute.''</p>
        <p>On Saturday, the clock begins ticking. With or without Ewing, the Knicks can ill-afford to give the Pacers a game on their home floor.</p>
