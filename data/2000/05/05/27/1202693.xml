        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>There may be debate over how to  carry out the reforms outlined in the master plan approved by the trustees of the City University of New York (news article, May 23). But there can be no debate that one of the most critical aspects of the plan is the creation of partnerships between CUNY and business.</p>
        <p>CUNY has the potential to be the engine driving the economic development of the metropolitan region by applying its intellectual capital to stimulate growth in technology and by offering educational opportunities tailor-made to accommodate the needs of potential workers and the existing work force in the new economy.</p>

        <p>Universities can no longer afford to be quasi-monastic entities that exist at arm's length from the experience of working Americans. Engagement with the community is essential for our success and for that of society at large.</p>
