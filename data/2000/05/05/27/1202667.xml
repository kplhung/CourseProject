        <p>The checks began cascading in a month before the elections in New Jersey last November -- $20,000 to the campaign arm of the Democrats in the State Senate, $15,000 to the Democratic machine in Hudson County, $15,000 to the one in Union County. Out of nowhere, it seemed, affluent guardian angels were coming to the party's aid.</p>
        <p>The organizer of the donations, and one of the chief givers, was Jon S. Corzine, the Democratic contender for the United States Senate, a rookie candidate who has sought to create something of an insta-bloc of support at the grass roots by raining his and his friends' money on local party treasuries in New Jersey.</p>
        <p>The Corzine campaign said on Thursday that as of May 17, it had spent $24.9 million, nearly all of it Mr. Corzine's money, to compete in the June 6 primary against former Gov. Jim Florio, easily a record for a Senate primary.</p>
        <p>Since then, the campaign has added another $5.8 million, according to documents filed with the Federal Election Commission. The new money puts his spending ahead of the previous record for an entire Senate election -- the nearly $30 million spent by Michael Huffington in his unsuccessful race in California  in 1994.</p>
        <p>The spending, largely on political advertisements, has vaulted the once-unknown Mr. Corzine, a former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company, past Mr. Florio in recent polls.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Corzine has not just used part of his $400 million fortune on 30-second television ads. With endorsements by local party committees a pivotal factor in New Jersey primaries, he has also funneled campaign cash directly to Democratic politicians and political organizations.</p>
        <p>This month, in fact, the Corzine campaign donated $20,000 to $30,000 each to 10 party organizations across New Jersey, from Bergen County in the north to Ocean County at the shore.</p>
        <p>And when Mr. Corzine's donations to the committees neared or reached legal limits, he recruited friends to make contributions -- friends like Steven Roth, whose company is one of the largest commercial property owners in Manhattan, and George Wellde Jr., who worked with Mr. Corzine at Goldman Sachs.</p>
        <p>This fund-raising offers a primer on how a newcomer can penetrate an often insular political culture and be embraced as a candidate -- a strategy also followed by Eliot L. Spitzer, another wealthy Democrat, who was elected New York attorney general in 1998 without experience in elected office.</p>
        <p>The donations in New Jersey, which helped the Democrats pick up seats in the State Assembly last November and win some important local elections, graphically highlight the question now dominating the Senate primary: has Mr. Corzine's money turned the race from a political contest to a financial one?</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio bluntly declares that Mr. Corzine is trying to buy the loyalty of party leaders and voters.</p>
        <p>''I think that it's been successful to the degree that he has gotten support from those who have been purchased,'' Mr. Florio said in an interview. ''But I'm not sure that it is going to be successful in the election, because I think that people have gotten to be offended by this unrelenting auction that we are in.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine did not respond to several requests to be interviewed for this article.</p>
        <p>His advisers say that the spending at the local level is intended to revitalize a party that has been financially troubled since it lost power in Trenton in the early 1990's. They point out that Mr. Corzine has long been a generous contributor to the Democratic Party on the national level, and is now merely redirecting his donations to the state and local party.</p>
        <p>''When Jim Florio raises money from people who received jobs and contracts from Governor Florio, he calls that principled support,'' said Orin S. Kramer, a financier who is a senior adviser and fund-raiser for Mr. Corzine.</p>
        <p>''When Jon receives endorsements from Democratic organizations which regard another Florio candidacy as the sequel to 'Nightmare on Elm Street,' the governor calls it bribery,'' Mr. Kramer said. ''If Governor Florio hadn't virtually eviscerated the Democratic Party a decade ago, we wouldn't have to work so hard at rebuilding it today.''</p>
        <p>Local support is important in New Jersey because the candidate endorsed by a county committee receives a better primary ballot position in that county.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Florio has been in politics in New Jersey for much of his life, Mr. Corzine has received the endorsement of counties that have about two-thirds of the state's registered Democrats.</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine has employed local chieftains -- an Essex County freeholder is on his campaign payroll, as is the party chairman in Ocean County -- and he regularly opens his checkbook for their campaigns and pet causes. One day, his campaign was spending $1,070 on catering for the Black United Fund; on another, it was $1,000 for tickets to a dinner for the Hispanic American Association for Political Awareness.</p>
        <p>And Mr. Corzine has added to this windfall for the party by corralling donations from friends, many of whom are newcomers to New Jersey politics.</p>
        <p>Under state law, party committees can accept a maximum of $30,000 annually per donor, while most candidates can receive up to $1,800 from each individual per election cycle. Once Mr. Corzine hits the limit, it is perfectly legal for him to ask his friends to contribute.</p>
        <p>In October, for example, Mr. Roth of Vornado Realty Trust donated $10,000 to the Democratic State Committee, $30,000 to the campaign arm of the Democrats in the State Senate and $10,000 to the Mercer County Democrats -- all at Mr. Corzine's request. Mr. Roth, who in recent years has mostly given to Republicans in New Jersey, would not comment.</p>
        <p>Or take the campaign committee of Mayor Sharpe James of Newark, who is also a state senator and one of the state's most influential black Democrats. Mr. Corzine and his wife, Joanne, each donated $1,800, the maximum, to Mr. James's committee. So did Mr. Kramer and his sister, Sari. And an array of other executives and their spouses, including Mr. Wellde, the Goldman Sachs executive, made donations.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wellde later gave $10,000 to the Assembly Democrats. Another former colleague of Mr. Corzine's at Goldman Sachs, Eric Mindich, donated $20,000 to the state party. Both men did not respond to phone calls at their offices seeking comment.</p>
        <p>Another big Wall Street donor was Adam Solomon, chairman of Shaker Investments, who, at Mr. Corzine's and Mr. Kramer's urging, contributed $15,000 to the Union County party and $15,000 to the Hudson County party.</p>
        <p>''As someone committed to the Democratic agenda,'' Mr. Solomon said, ''I believe that it is very important that Jon Corzine be the party nominee because he is our strongest candidate in November. Supporting Jon is also an effective way of helping Democrats at both the local and national levels.''</p>
        <p>While the Florio campaign has complained that many local politicians have endorsed Mr. Corzine solely to get access to his wallet, the politicians have usually responded by saying that Mr. Florio is not electable because of the tax increase he pushed through when he was governor. And they maintain that candidates for major offices are always channeling money to local committees.</p>
        <p>The Democrats in the State Assembly received an array of donations from Mr. Corzine and his supporters last fall -- several large ones to their political committee, and smaller ones to the candidates' campaigns. Their leader is Assemblyman Joseph V. Doria of Hudson County, one of the most influential supporters of Mr. Corzine's candidacy in the state.</p>
        <p>''It's nothing different than what Jim Florio did when he was governor,'' Mr. Doria said of the donations. ''Florio was helping us with campaigns, providing money to the local parties. This is part of the political process and part of political leadership. There is nothing wrong with it.''</p>
        <p>When told of Mr. Doria's comments, Mr. Florio scoffed and said that nothing in the state's political history approached Mr. Corzine's spending.</p>
        <p>''This is truly an effort to purchase not just the nomination, not just the job, but the party itself,'' Mr. Florio said.</p>
