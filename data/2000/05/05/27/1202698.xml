        <p>IN the pulpit of Riverside Church yesterday morning, speaker after speaker gave witness to the short, productive life of Malik Sealy.</p>
        <p>His wife, Lisa, said she lost a soul mate when he was killed in an automobile accident last Saturday in Minnesota. Sealy's older brother Dessalines talked about Malik's wry humor and comical ways. Lou Carnesecca, his coach at St. John's, described Sealy as a responsible, loyal star, always focused on the big picture.</p>
        <p>Sam Mitchell, who played with Sealy with the Indiana Pacers beginning in 1992, when Sealy was a rookie, and who was his teammate on the Timberwolves the past two seasons, described him as the thread that brought the Minnesota team together this season.</p>
        <p>''He preached closeness,'' Mitchell said. ''He said that if we put all the jealousy, all the contract business on the side, we could win.''</p>
        <p>Malik Sealy was a product of the multilayered culture of New York City basketball, and yesterday was a celebration of a basketball life. All boroughs, several generations, all levels of his basketball life converged on the Manhattan church. Sealy was a perfect synthesis of the city's basketball underground, the playground leagues and the theater of professional basketball.</p>
        <p>Generations of St. John's players and New York players -- some known, some mostly unknown warriors of the paint -- came to pay tribute: Billy Singleton, Shawnelle Scott, Greg (Boo) Harvey, whom knowledgeable folks had not seen or heard from in years. The New York City legends Tiny Archibald, Kenny Smith, Rod Strickland and Kenny Anderson huddled in one place, while the current and former National Basketball Association players Ray Allen, Joe Smith, Cedric Ceballos, Terry Dehere and probably many more familiar faces circulated.</p>
        <p>The entire Timberwolves team came for the service. Mitchell spoke, Kevin Garnett was a pallbearer. During a smaller ceremony a day earlier, Garnett wept as he spoke about Sealy. In a league in which rich young stars aren't often inclined to listen, the 24-year-old Garnett looked up to the 30-year-old Sealy. As an eighth grader in Chicago, shy and lacking confidence, Garnett watched St. John's play and recognized himself in Sealy: same body type, same way of moving.</p>
        <p>When Sealy wound up with Minnesota in 1998, he became Garnett's mentor, teaching him lessons of how to move in the crevices of fame, how to enjoy notoriety without being devoured by it. Now, in death, Sealy was teaching his young friend to absorb the lesson of his life despite these tragic circumstances.</p>
        <p>Before yesterday's service, Garnett shook his head and said: ''This is real life. Real life.''</p>
        <p>Five Indiana Pacers flew in Thursday night to make yesterday morning's service: Mark Jackson, Chris Mullin, Dale Davis, Reggie Miller and Al Harrington. What an odd juxtaposition of reality and respect.</p>
        <p>Indiana holds a two-games-to-none lead over the Knicks, but the Pacers, for all the talk about hicks, were more New York than the Knicks. Mullin is from Brooklyn, Jackson is from Queens, Harrington is from Roselle, N.J.; Miller's second home is Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>Missing were the Knicks. The team arrived from Indianapolis at 3 a.m. yesterday. With a 10 a.m. service and a 2 p.m. practice, the team could not make it work. Charles Oakley, the former Knick who plays for the Toronto Raptors, was the closest the Knicks came to having a presence.</p>
        <p>Sealy's family, with the help of the N.B.A., put together a video of his life: a collage of baby pictures; footage from Tolentine High in the Bronx; slam-dunking days at St. John's; and draft day with Commissioner David Stern's announcement that Sealy was headed to Indiana. Fast-forward to Sealy's successes with Minnesota this season, replete with dunks and game-winning shots. The audience at Riverside cheered, and for a time we were all back in that moment when Sealy was alive. Finally, there was wedding footage, just a few months ago, of Lisa and Malik Sealy, with their son Malik Jr. The final shot showed Sealy in a dressing room. Confident and assured, he said: ''I'm a renaissance man. Artist, a designer, an athlete. There is nothing I can't do.''</p>
        <p>The large screen was rolled away, and we were confronted more powerfully than before by the hollow echo of real life; the finality of Malik Sealy's death at age 30.</p>
        <p>As mourners filed out of the church, a few went over to where Reggie Miller was standing with Mark Jackson. For all the sadness of Sealy's death, the fact that Game 3 was being played in New York today was never far from the surface. This is the hard-edged New York basketball tradition that produced Sealy. The game must go on.</p>
        <p>Fans kidded Miller with respect and warmth. ''I'm a Knicks fan, but I respect your game,'' and ''Reggie, you play hard, man, I got to give it to you; I still like the Knicks.'' Miller, wearing sunglasses, nodded politely but said nothing. He hugged a close friend and spoke quietly to another but generally kept a low profile. He knew this was not his day; he came, like the others, to pay final respects to a colleague, a veteran of hardcourt wars. A friend.</p>
