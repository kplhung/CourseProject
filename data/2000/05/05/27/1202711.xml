        <p>Kurt Thomas sat on a chair at the end of the court, staring ahead, past the reporters and his teammates, perhaps all the way to Saturday at Madison Square Garden. He may find himself the Knicks' starting center in one of season's biggest games.</p>
        <p>With Patrick Ewing's availability in question, Thomas is next in line to assume the starting spot when the Knicks, already down two games to none in the Eastern Conference finals, play host to the Pacers in Game 3. Thomas wants the job, having longed for minutes throughout the postseason.</p>
        <p>The 28 minutes he logged in Ewing's absence in Game 2 were 12 more than his next highest total in the playoffs and 15 more than he played in Game 1, and his criticism was aimed more at his own coach than at the opposition.</p>
        <p>''This is what I get paid to do,'' he said today at Purchase College. ''I hate to see Patrick get injured, but I've just got to go out there and play. Of course I hope he can play. We need Patrick if we want to make some kind of run in the playoffs.''</p>
        <p>The piercing stare from the 6-foot-9-inch Thomas that may worry some forwards will be useless against the 7-4 Rik Smits. Still, Thomas played well against Smits when he got his chance, contributing 10 points and 8 rebounds in Game 2.</p>
        <p>But Thomas has been foul prone and has displayed a quick temper.</p>
        <p>''You try to stay in front of him as much as possible, just try to keep my body between him and the basket,'' Thomas said of Smits. ''He's 7-4 and he's so long. It's really hard for me to contest his shots. Of course, he knows he can shoot over me at any opportunity. I just have to try to get my hands in his face as much as possible.''</p>
        <p>Thomas has committed 35 fouls in 156 minutes in the postseason, recording one more foul than his rebound total. The task is made more difficult by the presence of Dale Davis, who has grabbed 16 rebounds in each of the first two games. But there is little choice for Thomas, as well as for Marcus Camby and Chris Dudley, who will probably play more.</p>
        <p>''We have to prepare as if he's not going to be there, but hopefully he will be,'' Thomas said of Ewing.</p>
        <p>''From what I understand, if he cannot play, I'll be starting at the center. I go in and whenever he calls my number, whatever he informs me I have to do, I go with the program.''</p>
        <p>Missed Signal</p>
        <p>Chris Childs did not practice, nursing a sore right knee from the fourth-quarter collision with Rik Smits. But that did not excuse him from a critique by Jeff Van Gundy. With just over three minutes remaining in Game  2, Van Gundy was signaling for Childs to call a timeout with the Knicks holding an 80-77 lead because Childs had been bumped to the floor by Smits on the previous sequence. But Childs ignored the request and missed a 3-point attempt. Smits then converted a 3-point play to tie the score. ''I was calling timeout because he said he was hurt,'' Van Gundy said. ''Then he waved me off and shot the 3. It was one of many bad plays in the last four minutes by us.''</p>
