        <p>Hansgeorg Hofmann says he is no corporate raider. But if Mr. Hofmann has his way, Germany's fourth-biggest bank will lose its independence.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hofmann, head of a small investment group called Cobra, has acquired voting rights to 19 percent of the stock in Commerzbank A.G. and he arrived at the bank's annual shareholders meeting today with what management regarded as a chilling message.</p>
        <p>Saying he had received ''signals'' from potential buyers, Mr. Hofmann warned that the bank's executives should brace for change.</p>
        <p>''You have consolidation everywhere in the industry, whether you think that is a good or a bad thing,'' he said. ''The world is different now, and the banks do not have too much time to reorient themselves.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hofmann is leading the kind of corporate crusade practiced by Americans like T. Boone Pickens in the 1980's. Marching under the banner of shareholder value, he has become what amounts to Commerzbank's biggest shareholder and hopes to engineer a merger or alliance for the bank that will allow his group to cash out with a big profit.</p>
        <p>Cobra itself has acquired little if any actual stock. But it says it has obtained options and voting rights to 19 percent and could raise its share to 30 percent, enough under German law to veto major decisions.</p>
        <p>After more than a month of polite exchanges with Mr. Hofmann, Commerzbank's chief executive, Martin Kohlhaussen, denounced him today, calling his assertions dangerous and irresponsible.</p>
        <p>Mr. Kohlhaussen was particularly incensed by Mr. Hoffman's saying  that Commerzbank's value was about 50 euros a share, far higher than its current price of 38.11 euros.</p>
        <p>The unusual public clash comes more than a month after Cobra announced it had accumulated a stake in Commerzbank and wanted to help the bank define its strategy.</p>
        <p>At the time, Mr. Hofmann said he hoped to increase Cobra's stake from 9.9 percent to 19 percent. Throughout the process, he has portrayed his group as interested in mediating a friendly deal, not a hostile takeover.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hofmann's main partners are Klaus-Peter Schneidewind and Clemens Vedder, who control Rebon, a Netherlands investment group that is Cobra's parent company. Mr. Schneidewind and Mr. Vedder have been involved in takeovers elsewhere in Europe, but Mr. Hofmann, who ran Dresdner Bank's investment banking business until 1996, is the main strategist on the Commerzbank investment.</p>
        <p>All three men were highly visible at today's shareholder meeting.</p>
        <p>They denied any interest in breaking up Commerzbank and selling it off in pieces, but left little doubt they could apply pressure.</p>
        <p>''If we needed to assemble a blocking minority, it could be done,'' Mr. Hofmann said.</p>
        <p>German bank executives have been speculating about possible buyers. Mr. Kohlhaussen recently softened his long-held opposition to any merger and said he might be open to talks with Dresdner Bank, Germany's third largest.</p>
        <p>Dresdner had reached a deal to merge with Deutsche Bank A.G., Germany's biggest bank, but the deal collapsed over the future of Dresdner's investment banking unit.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hofmann has suggested that a merger with a foreign institution would be better for Commerzbank.  Many candidates have been rumored, including Citigroup, ABN Amro of the Netherlands and HSBC Holdings of Britain.</p>
