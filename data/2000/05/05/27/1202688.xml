        <p>Carl Everett speaks disdainfully of the Yankees, implies that they are unremarkable, a common team with lots of championship rings.</p>
        <p>But Everett's description is charitable when applied to the season's first meeting between the Yankees and his Boston Red Sox last night. The Yankees played poorly and suffered the consequences, losing 4-1 at Yankee Stadium. Boston's Ramon Martinez began the game with a 6.95 earned run average and allowed one run over seven and two-thirds innings; David Cone is 1-4 after 10 starts. ''It's waste,'' Manager Joe Torre said. ''It's a waste for us.''</p>

        <p>Carl Everett speaks disdainfully of the Yankees, implies that they are unremarkable, a common team with lots of championship rings.</p>
        <p>But Everett's description is charitable when applied to the season's first meeting between the Yankees and his Boston Red Sox last night. The Yankees played poorly and suffered the consequences, losing 4-1 at Yankee Stadium. Boston's Ramon Martinez began the game with a 6.95 earned run average and allowed one run over seven and two-thirds innings; David Cone is 1-4 after 10 starts. ''It's waste,'' Manager Joe Torre said. ''It's a waste for us.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees have help on the way, for they likely will activate shortstop Derek Jeter from the disabled list in time for today's game. Jeter went 2 for 3 in a minor league game in Tampa, Fla., last night and intended to return to the New York area on a rented jet. Since Jeter strained a muscle in his abdomen on May 11, the Yankees have dropped 9 of 13 games. It is expected that Boston shortstop Nomar Garciaparra, who has had a strained hamstring, also will be activated.</p>
        <p>Even if this loss had not been to the Red Sox, even if it did not force the Yankees out of the first-place tie with Boston, it would have been a brutal defeat. Torre has said many times that he does not lose sleep over one-sided losses, but he might have gone home last night and replayed the pivotal moments on the back of his eyelids when the Yankees gave away runs -- some scored by the Red Sox, and some the Yankees should have scored.</p>
        <p>First inning. The Red Sox had runners at first and third and one out and Cone was struggling; among his many pitches, only his split-fingered fastball had any real quality to it, and Cone was trying desperately to make the Red Sox hitters chase his splitter. Brian Daubach swung and bounced a quick one-hopper right back to Cone.</p>
        <p>His entire career, Cone's first instinct has been to barricade all base runners from home plate, prevent any runs from scoring. He saw Jeff Frye lurch off third base, moved toward him and immediately realized he had made a serious mistake, that he should have thrown to second to begin what likely would have been an easy inning-ending double play.</p>
        <p>But Frye got into a rundown long enough for John Valentin to take third and Daubach to reach second. The crowd of 54,470 cheered Cone, but he knew better, berating himself behind the mound after the play was over; ''stupid'' was among the many words he muttered. Everett dumped a single into center field and two runs scored, two runs that never should have scored. When the half-inning ended, Cone said he felt ''I deserved it. I felt I deserved that for the mistake I made.''</p>
        <p>Cone thought he should have anticipated the chopper back to the mound and been prepared, rather than allow himself to be distracted by Frye. ''It's an inexcusable mistake,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Cone continued to labor, walking two batters in the second inning, then giving up a two-run homer to Mike Stanley in the third. In the first 58 innings Cone pitched this season, at least one runner reached base in 49 innings.</p>
        <p>But Cone seemed to get loose in the middle innings, his control improving, and he pinned the Red Sox to their four runs. Clay Bellinger ripped a solo home run off Martinez in the third. The Yankees trailed by 4-1 after three innings. They still were in a position to come back, and their opportunity came in the fifth.</p>
        <p>Chris Turner looped a single to right field to lead off, before Bellinger pulled a grounder through the left side of the infield. Two runners on, nobody out, top of the order coming up. With Chuck Knoblauch out of the lineup with a bruised wrist, Ricky Ledee was the leadoff hitter, and he hit a soft line drive toward center field.</p>
        <p>Playing center, Everett had been positioned extremely shallow, as if he was daring the Yankees to drive the ball over his head. As the lead runner, Turner usually would have scored easily on a hit like Ledee's in Yankee Stadium, but Turner was unsure whether the ball was going to fall. He hesitated between second and third before moving ahead. Willie Randolph, the third base coach, beckoned Turner to third with a wave.</p>
        <p>Bellinger did not hesitate. ''I read base hit all the way,'' he said. He charged around second, glanced at Randolph, saw him waving to Turner and figured the catcher was going home.</p>
        <p>Bellinger was only about 20 feet from third base when he realized that Turner was standing at the base. Bellinger was tagged out easily, with Ledee pulling into second. The bases should have been loaded with nobody out, but now there was one out with runners at second and third. Wilson Delgado popped out, Paul O'Neill grounded out, and the inning was over.</p>
        <p>''I guess my mistake was not seeing where Turner was,'' said Bellinger, who said he was thinking he had a chance to score. ''I was being aggressive.''</p>
        <p>Said Torre: ''Bellinger made the right read'' on Ledee's pop fly, ''and the wrong decision. It may be the reason we lost -- you don't want to hang the goat horns on anyone -- but it sure as heck took us out of the big inning. It was just a bad play. No excuse for something like that.''</p>
        <p>The Yankees are just another team, Carl Everett has said. Last night, it would have been hard to argue the point.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>CHUCK KNOBLAUCH was scratched from the starting lineup because of a bruised wrist, which has bothered him since he tagged out a Cleveland runner on May 21. An X-ray did not reveal any fractures, and the Yankees said Knoblauch's status would be evaluated day-to-day.</p>
