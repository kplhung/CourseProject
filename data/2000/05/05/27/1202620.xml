        <p>An influential Republican member of the House and a Democratic senator announced today that they would collaborate on a bipartisan effort to add prescription drug benefits to Medicare this year.</p>
        <p>The effort, by Representative Bill Thomas, Republican of California, and Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, alters the politics of the issue in this election year, at least marginally increasing the chances that Congress can break the deadlock on Medicare coverage of prescription drugs.</p>
        <p>''There needs to be a bipartisan, bicameral effort to move on this issue before the end of this session,'' said Mr. Thomas, who has authority over Medicare as chairman of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Health.</p>
        <p>In effect, Mr. Wyden embraced many of the principles endorsed by House Republicans as the framework for a plan to offer drug benefits to all 39 million people on Medicare. In return, he got a commitment from Mr. Thomas to support several Democratic goals.</p>
        <p>For example, Mr. Thomas agreed that drug companies should pay a fee to the government whenever they develop profitable drugs by exploiting the fruits of research subsidized by the federal government.</p>
        <p>The Thomas-Wyden collaboration is significant for several reasons. It is one of the first serious efforts by members of opposing parties to find common ground on Medicare drug benefits. Until now, President Clinton and Democrats have pushed their proposals and attacked Republican ideas as inadequate, while Republicans have belittled the Democratic proposals.</p>
        <p>A Senate Democrat expressed concern about possible political consequences of today's announcement, saying, ''This will blur the lines between Republicans and Democrats on what is one of the Democrats' best election issues.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas and Mr. Wyden are considered experts on health policy. Each shares the politics of his party leaders and the dominant faction in his party; neither is a maverick.</p>
        <p>Mr. Wyden has a liberal voting record and has long been an advocate for the elderly. As a young lawyer, he led the Oregon chapter of Gray Panthers. He was immersed in health care issues for 15 years as a member of the House.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas has become the point man for House Republicans on health policy, the person who explains the intricacies of Medicare. He is an architect of a House Republican proposal, outlined last month, that would use private insurance subsidized by the government to help pay drug costs for the elderly.</p>
        <p>John P. Feehery, a spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, described today's announcement as ''a welcome development.'' Congressional aides said the Senate Democratic leader, Tom Daschle of South Dakota, had urged Mr. Wyden to be cautious in dealing with the Republicans. But Molly Rowley, a spokeswoman for Mr. Daschle, said the joint effort could ''add some sense of urgency, some traction and increase the likelihood that legislation will be passed this year.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas and Mr. Wyden said they would not write a bill of their own, but would continually work with each other to push legislation. In effect, they have opened a channel for communication and cooperation between the parties.</p>
        <p>The two lawmakers endorsed these principles:</p>
        <p>*Coverage of prescription drugs should be guaranteed as ''an entitlement'' to any Medicare beneficiary who wants it. (Democrats insist on an entitlement.)</p>
        <p>*Medicare drug benefits should be supervised by the Department of Health and Human Services, but probably not by the Health Care Financing Administration, the much criticized agency that now runs Medicare.</p>
        <p>*The government should help pool the purchasing power of Medicare beneficiaries so they can obtain discounts on drugs, like the discounts negotiated by health maintenance organizations and other big buyers.</p>
        <p>*The government should pay most of the drug costs of people with very high drug expenses. This subsidy would reduce premiums for everyone by reducing the total costs that must be covered by premiums.</p>
        <p>*The United States should discuss drug prices as an issue in trade negotiations with Canada and other countries that regulate such prices. Such discussions might find ways to reduce the disparities, thus reducing the incentive for United States residents to cross the border to get less costly drugs.</p>
        <p>Chris Jennings, the president's health policy coordinator, said he did not know enough about the Thomas-Wyden effort to comment. ''I don't think there are any details,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Thomas and Mr. Wyden did not say what premiums would be charged for drug coverage. They did agree that some of the cost should be defrayed by drug companies.</p>
        <p>''Chairman Thomas, for the first time, has agreed to require that drug companies pay a return-on-investment fee to the Medicare trust fund when they profit from government-funded research,'' Mr. Wyden said. ''Again and again, taxpayers have put up the dollars to fund the critical early research that brings blockbuster drugs to the market. It's only fair that these taxpayer investments be recognized through compensation by the company to our government.''</p>
