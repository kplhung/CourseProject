        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Your May 23 front-page article about President Clinton's potential disbarment says, ''It is not clear what practical effect a disbarment would have on Mr. Clinton's career after he leaves the White House.''</p>
        <p>One significant effect is that disbarment could prevent him from serving as a corporate director or executive officer. Under the Securities and Exchange Commission rules, a public company must disclose to its investors whether a director, candidate for director or officer was subjected to legal proceedings deemed relevant to the person's ability or integrity, during the company's last five years. These include any court orders barring such a person from ''engaging in any type of business practice,'' which would likely include a disbarment.</p>

        <p>Many public companies would probably not select a person required to make these disclosures as an officer or director. Thus, disbarment could jeopardize Mr. Clinton's post-presidential career beyond his ability to practice law.</p>
