        <p>Members of the 870-member ruling council of the Ulster Unionist party convene here on Saturday for a crucial vote that will either give new life to the Northern Ireland peace accord or likely finish it off.</p>
        <p>The outcome will turn on whether the pro-British party, whose longtime slogan was ''Ulster says no,'' retreats to its rejectionist past and renounces the current formula for stabilizing the volatile sectarian politics of Ulster or follows the lead of its moderating leader, David Trimble, who is proposing a future based on a risk-taking accommodation with the pro-Irish republican movement.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trimble, a Nobel Peace Prize winner, said today that he did not want to characterize the balloting as a ''back me or sack me'' vote. But if he is defeated, his five-year-old leadership is almost certainly over.</p>
        <p>He is asking his party to accept an Irish Republican Army offer to permit inspections of its secret arms dumps as a credible disarmament move justifying a return by the Ulster Unionists to participation in home rule government with Sinn Fein, the political representatives of the I.R.A. If he prevails, the suspended Northern Ireland Assembly will function again by Wednesday.</p>
        <p>Mr. Trimble succeeded last November in persuading his quarrelsome party, the province's largest Protestant group, to begin joint rule with its Catholic rivals in Sinn Fein, but that power-sharing government was put on hold by Britain in February after only nine weeks when the I.R.A. failed to make expected companion moves on weapons.</p>
        <p>On May 6, the I.R.A. announced that it would let international inspectors monitor its hidden arsenals and said that it would ''completely and verifiably put I.R.A. arms beyond use.'' The statement came at a time of deepening gloom among peace negotiators and lifted hopes that a stalemate over guerrilla disarmament that had blocked progress in the peace accord had been broken.</p>
        <p>The Ulster Unionists have long argued that they would not go into government with Sinn Fein without assurances that its I.R.A. allies would disarm. Mr. Trimble says he believes that the new action by the I.R.A. constitutes that assurance. His opponents, who have maintained a stance they call ''no guns, no government,'' say it does not.</p>
        <p>The anti-agreement faction has broadened its demands for concessions, reviving past ties to cherished symbols of national identity. The debate that was confined to weapons now turns on additional issues, like  whether the British or Irish flag will fly above government buildings, what name the new police force will  bear and what emblems will appear on police badges and caps.</p>
