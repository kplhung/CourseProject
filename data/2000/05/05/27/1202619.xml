        <p>Stocks ended a tough week slightly lower yesterday, with the Dow Jones industrial average at its lowest level since mid-March.</p>
        <p>Trading ahead of the three-day Memorial Day weekend was the slowest this year, adding to the volatility during the day. But although yesterday's declines were small they deepened the sharp drop for the week. It appeared that the bearish sentiment arising from the Federal Reserve's short-term interest rate increase 10 days ago had not abated.</p>
        <p>When investors return Tuesday, they will still have to face uncertainty about how much higher the nation's central bank will push short-term interest rates. And they will be wondering if the beleaguered technology sector has farther to fall.</p>
        <p>Richard E. Cripps, the chief market strategist at Legg Mason Wood Walker in Baltimore, predicted that all three major market indexes would remain in a trading range, with the bottom a little below where it is now, until investors sensed that the Federal Reserve had finished raising interest rates.</p>
        <p>He also said that investors would have to find new ''drivers'' for the market because he did not expect technology stocks ''to continue the performance in the future that they have had in the past.''</p>
        <p>The Nasdaq composite index slipped 0.24 point, to 3,205.11, while the Dow fell 24.68 points, or 0.2 percent, to 10,299.24. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500-stock index dropped 3.5 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,378.02. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was very light, with just 722.7 million shares changing hands. The daily average for the year is 1.04 billion.</p>
        <p>For the week, the Nasdaq fell 5.5 percent. For the year, the technology-heavy index is down 21.2 percent and is just above its low for the year, which it reached on Tuesday. The Dow fell 3.1 percent for the week and is off 10.4 percent for the year. The Dow is also now below the level it fell to during the week ending April 14. That week's 7.3 percent decline was the Dow's worst weekly performance since 1989.</p>
        <p>The S.&amp; P. declined 2.1 percent for the week and is off 6.2 percent for the year. It is still 21.46 points above its April 14 level.</p>
        <p>Among the big decliners for the week were General Motors, down 19 percent, and Georgia-Pacific, down 18.3 percent. G.M. disappointed investors by limiting participation in an exchange of its stock for a stake in its Hughes Electronics subsidiary. Georgia-Pacific and other paper companies fell over concern about slumping prices and fears that rising interest rates would slow economic growth.</p>
        <p>The Goldman Sachs Group, which dropped 17.4 percent, warned analysts that second-quarter earnings would be less than expected.</p>
        <p>On the technology side, CMGI fell 16.9 percent, Broadvision dropped 18.6 percent, Qualcomm declined 25.9 percent and Qlogic slipped 26 percent. Microsoft also had a rough week, falling 5.6 percent. But Intel rallied yesterday to finish the week off less than 0.3 percent.</p>
        <p>With every investor looking for signs that the economy is finally slowing under the weight of the Fed's higher interest rates, the bond market got a lift from the report that orders for durable goods fell 6.4 percent in April, more than forecast. The yield on the Treasury's 10-year note fell to 6.32 percent, from 6.39 percent on Thursday. The price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 15/32, to 10 18/32. The yield was down from 6.48 percent a week ago. The yield on the 30-year bond fell to 6.06 percent from 6.11 percent on Thursday and was down from 6.20 percent a week ago.</p>
        <p>One measure of investor sentiment on how much higher the Fed might push its benchmark federal funds target is federal funds futures contracts. The contract for October now shows an average rate for the month of 7.03 percent, down just slightly from 7.06 percent a week ago. The December contract is at 7.16 percent. Currently, the Fed's target is at 6.5 percent after the increase of five-tenths of a percentage point on May 16.</p>
        <p>Several factors have been undermining the technology sector. One is that the flow of funds into the aggressive growth and technology stock mutual funds that invest in the technology sector has sharply declined recently. According to AMG Data Services, the pace of net inflows into these funds was $6.8 billion over the four weeks ended March 22. That fell to $3.1 billion for the week ended April 12, and is now down to $948 million for the four weeks ended May 24. And for the last week, there were net outflows from these funds: $169 million from technology and $496 million from aggressive growth funds.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cripps of Legg Mason also said that money managers and individual investors were still overloaded with technology stocks. He said that as these stocks fell further more investors and managers would decide they had too many and would sell, adding to the downward pressure on this sector.</p>
