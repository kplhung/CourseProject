        <p>A 24-year-old man from Yonkers tumbled out of the upper deck at Yankee Stadium in the third inning, landed on the protective screen behind the field level seats and lay there unconscious for several minutes. The fan finally woke up and, after waving to the spectators below him, crawled back up the screen where security officials from Major League Baseball and the Yankees were waiting for him.</p>
        <p>Steve Laurenzi, the fan, was charged with disorderly conduct. Kevin Hallinan, the head of security for Major League Baseball, said Laurenzi appeared uninjured, but he was removed on a stretcher with his entire body strapped down and with his neck immobilized.</p>
        <p>''We were concerned about the physical injuries,'' Hallinan said. ''At this point, it appears like he's O.K.''</p>
        <p>Hallinan said witnesses told the police that Laurenzi jumped intentionally. But Christopher Burns, 26, who coaches baseball with Laurenzi, said: ''He went for a foul ball and the next thing I knew he was gone. It was like a movie that didn't turn out the right way.''</p>
