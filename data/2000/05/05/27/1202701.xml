        <p>Despite a few standout individual performances, the Mets have been a mediocre offensive team. Coming into tonight's game against the St. Louis Cardinals, they ranked 12th among the 16 National League clubs in runs scored and batting average, 11th in homers and 10th in hits.</p>
        <p>But the Mets know how to walk, just as they did last year. They ranked second in the league in walks, and they drew nine tonight. The Mets strolled away with a 5-2 victory, the fourth in a row for the starter Mike Hampton, who also contributed with his bat, as usual.</p>

        <p>Despite a few standout individual performances, the Mets have been a mediocre offensive team. Coming into tonight's game against the St. Louis Cardinals, they ranked 12th among the 16 National League clubs in runs scored and batting average, 11th in homers and 10th in hits.</p>
        <p>But the Mets know how to walk, just as they did last year. They ranked second in the league in walks, and they drew nine tonight. The Mets strolled away with a 5-2 victory, the fourth in a row for the starter Mike Hampton, who also contributed with his bat, as usual.</p>
        <p>Hampton (6-4) went eight innings, allowing two runs on nine hits and two walks, lowering his earned run average to 3.99. He also had two singles and a sacrifice fly, improving his batting average to .308.</p>
        <p>With the score tied, 2-2, in the seventh inning, Cardinals reliever Mark Thompson (0-1) walked Derek Bell, Edgardo Alfonzo and Mike Piazza with two out.</p>
        <p>''We go through some periods where we're chasing some pitches,'' Robin Ventura said. ''If we're patient and seeing pitches, that just shows some trust in the people behind you in the lineup.''</p>
        <p>The Mets always trust Ventura with the bases loaded. He singled to right off the left-hander Mike Mohler, bringing in two runs and raising his career average with the bases loaded to .364.</p>
        <p>That was the second Mets rally aided by three two-out walks. With two out in the first, Alfonzo doubled off the wall in left-center. The Cardinals starter Pat Hentgen threw 12 balls and a strike to the next three hitters -- Piazza, Ventura and Todd Zeile -- and the walks forced in Alfonzo with the game's first run. But Benny Agbayani struck out looking, leaving the bases loaded.</p>
        <p>Four batters into the Cardinals' first, the bases were loaded again in similar fashion. Edgar Renteria doubled down the left-field line, and consecutive walks by Hampton loaded the bases. It was a good time for Hampton to be wild -- he walked the most dangerous Cardinals, Jim Edmonds and Mark McGwire -- but it brought up Eric Davis, who had six  hits in 10 career at-bats against Hampton coming into the game.</p>
        <p>''I always feel that I'm one pitch away from a ground-ball double play,'' Hampton said. ''If I made my pitches where I need them to be, I've got a good chance at getting them to hit the ball on the ground.''</p>
        <p>Exactly: Davis buried a sinker into the grass, and shortstop Rey Ordonez scooped it up to start an inning-ending double play.</p>
        <p>The Cardinals loaded the bases again in the second inning, on three two-out singles, but again Hampton escaped trouble, getting Renteria to strike out on a checked swing.</p>
        <p>The Mets (26-22) were having little luck against Hentgen -- besides a single Hampton chopped over the infield in the second -- but they manufactured a run in an unusual way in the fourth. Agbayani grounded a single to right to lead off the inning, then stole second on a hit-and-run when Ordonez let a curveball in the dirt go by.</p>
        <p>Hampton was on deck, and his average was more than 100 points better than Ordonez's. Ordonez tried to bunt for a hit, but it went for a sacrifice and Agbayani advanced to third. Hampton then came up and delivered the sacrifice fly to left, giving the Mets a 2-0 lead.</p>
        <p>''Rey's bunting for a base hit, but we'll take a sacrifice,'' Mets Manager Bobby Valentine said. ''That being said, Mike's swinging the bat really well. When it's a close game, I don't mind him hitting with a man on third and one out.''</p>
        <p>The Cardinals (28-19) got a run back on a groundout in the fourth, then tied the score in the fifth when Edmonds led off with a mammoth home run to right-center off a hanging slider. It was one of few mistakes Hampton made in his latest stellar outing. Hampton has allowed only three earned runs in 311/3  innings over his last four starts, and he has issued only four walks.</p>
        <p>''Now I'm getting into the swing of things,'' he said, ''and the games are starting to get fun.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>Right-fielder DEREK BELL has no hits in his last 17 at-bats. His average dropped to .328 from .360. . . . Outfielder JOE McEWING, who endeared himself to Cardinals fans with his performance and attitude last year, received a prolonged ovation when he was announced as the leadoff hitter for the Mets. Bidding on autographed photos of McEwing at a Cardinals charity auction began at $75. . . . The infielder-outfielder MELVIN MORA is eligible to come off the disabled list on Sunday, but Manager BOBBY VALENTINE does not expect him back soon. Mora, who needed four stitches in his right index finger after injuring it while bunting May 12, has a bruise on the finger. He has been playing mostly designated hitter in a rehabilitation assignment for Class AAA Norfolk, where he is hitting .316. . . . The infielder KURT ABBOTT has three hits in 32 at-bats since April 28, and he is still without a run batted in this season. Before the game, Abbott studied videotape of himself from last year, and he realized the timing of his swing was off now.</p>
