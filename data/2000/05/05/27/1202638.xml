        <p>Carved by ice and washed by as much as 12 feet of rain a year, the Tongass National Forest stretches across Alaska's panhandle, full of coastal fjords and majestic strands of spruce, cedar and hemlock, which John Muir described in 1879 as a seemingly ''indefinite, on-leading expansiveness.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, at 17 million acres, the Tongass is more than three times the size of any other national forest. But as the Clinton administration promotes its far-reaching plan to safeguard the forests by banning new road building throughout much of the system, the Tongass has a curious distinction: it is the one national forest specifically exempted from such a ban.</p>
        <p>There are already more than 4,000 miles of logging roads snaking through the rain forest here, built as part of the nation's most heavily subsidized logging program, one that costs taxpayers about $30 million a year but is fiercely defended by Alaska's tiny but powerful Congressional delegation.</p>
        <p>With 400 miles of new federal logging roads slated to be built in the Tongass rain forest over the next four years, the exemption has already set off a battle between national environmental groups and the timber industry.</p>
        <p>And here in southeast Alaska, where the tourism industry now outpaces timber as a source of jobs, the debate over whether to build more logging roads in the world's largest remaining stretch of temperate rain forest is also surprisingly spirited, in a way that would have been unthinkable a generation ago when logging was firmly seen as the great spur to jobs in the sparsely populated area.</p>
        <p>While logging interests complain that environmental restrictions have already cost the region hundreds of good jobs over the years and closed down two big mills, many of those who make their money by guiding tourists and sport fishers through the spectacular inlets and past the emerald forests favor more protections, and even an end to any clear-cutting in the Tongass.</p>
        <p>And while just about everyone here agrees that America's largest, wildest national forest holds great resources, the core question in the debate is this: just how much of an economic resource is untouched wilderness?</p>
        <p>''A lot of Alaskans don't like what we are inevitably becoming -- a place where people come to see it, rather than to exploit it,'' said Richard Nelson, a writer and cultural anthropologist who is on the board of the Sitka Conservation Society, an environmental group that wants to include the Tongass in President Clinton's ban on new road building.</p>
        <p>''The whole frontier philosophy, the whole conquest-of-wilderness mentality, is certainly alive and well here,'' Mr. Nelson said. ''But there is a whole opposite ethic that is growing fast.''</p>
        <p>There is no question that much of the battle over what to do with the Tongass will be fought in Washington.</p>
        <p>For environmentalists, ''leaving the Tongass out of this plan is like deciding to protect all national parks except Yellowstone,'' said Matthew Zencey, the Washington-based manager of the Alaska Rainforest Campaign, an umbrella coalition that hopes to have much of the forest protected by a road ban.</p>
        <p>The timber industry is similarly animated, saying the Tongass is already subject to a federal ''management plan'' that balances wilderness protection in the area with a prudent amount of logging. The administration, in fact, cited that plan in exempting Tongass from its road restrictions, although other areas also have management plans. But critics of the exemption have suggested that the administration was merely trying to avoid picking a fight with Alaska's senators, who both lead committees that have authority over the forest service.</p>
        <p>But as the land use struggle ensues thousands of miles away, people who live here are also clearly divided over whether the forest is chiefly useful for timber, or tourism, or both in equal measure.</p>
        <p>In Sitka, for instance, the onetime capital of Russian America that is ringed by forests, sea and a snow-covered volcano on a nearby island, the city split a few years ago (1,702 against, 1,068 for) when a nonbinding measure was put on the local ballot to make it the city's official policy to oppose clear-cutting in the nearby national forest.</p>
        <p>Both tourism and fishing now outrank the timber industry as a source of jobs in southeast Alaska, according to the state's Department of Labor and Workforce Development, a situation that is radically different from the case 25 years ago and that logging officials attribute to protections that environmentalists have already secured for the Tongass.</p>
        <p>One came in the Carter administration, setting aside more than five million acres as wilderness, and another in the Bush administration, when Congress agreed to phase out much of a subsidy that was allowing two major timber companies to pay as little as $2 for huge Sitka spruce logs that would fetch about $300 on the open market. The subsidy dated to the 1950's, when the United States Forest Service agreed to provide a steady supply of timber at low prices to two companies that agreed to build pulp mills in the area.</p>
        <p>Both of those mills are closed now -- one near here may be reconverted into a privately owned water-bottling plant, under a plan that is still being negotiated -- and the area now welcomes about 700,000 tourists every summer, more than double the number a decade ago. Many come in the cruise ships that glide by the magnificent scenery and dock in and around the coastal towns. Others come to fish with one of the dozens of guide companies that advertise their services in what many call ''the salmon capital of the world.''</p>
        <p>Tourism is all well and good, but there is no reason for that industry not to coexist with continued logging, said Senator Frank H. Murkowski, the Alaska Republican who is chairman of a committee that oversees natural resources.</p>
        <p>''So a tourist in Alaska comes in on a boat, and he gets off in Ketchikan or Juneau, and maybe spends a little money here, spends a little money there, and gets back on the boat,'' Mr. Murkowski said in a telephone interview from Washington. ''That's important. It's a significant contribution. But it's not sufficient. What we really do well is, we grow timber and we grow fish. And they're both renewable if you do it correctly.''</p>
        <p>Besides, he added: ''If we've done such a bad job with this forest in Alaska, then why is it still so scenic today for tourism? Why do so many people still want to come here?''</p>
        <p>Under the president's plan, the  Forest Service would ban road building in areas of the national forests where there are currently no roads. The plan would protect about 43 million acres that could be logged, roughly one-quarter of the 192 million acres in the national forest system. That would reduce planned timber harvests, now at about 3.6 billion board feet a year, by about 700 million board feet. (There are about 10,000 board feet of lumber in an average-size American home.)</p>
        <p>But under the administration's recently announced preference, no such ban would apply in the 17-million-acre Tongass forest, and a decision on whether to impose a ban would not be made until 2004.</p>
        <p>The Forest Service's program in the Tongass already operates at a deficit of about $30 million a year, meaning that the federal government pays that much more to build roads and maintain the forest than it takes in from timber companies, which grind most of the trees to a pulp that is sold for export.</p>
        <p>That subsidy used to be even larger, and the program remains popular in some quarters here.</p>
        <p>''Yes, we manage forests at a net loss for the taxpayer,'' said Bob Weinstein, the mayor of Ketchikan, a timber town at the southeastern tip of the state. ''But that doesn't bother me until such time as the United States government eliminates every direct or indirect subsidy for any business.''</p>
        <p>Mayor Weinstein, a visceral opponent of a road building ban in the Tongass, said logging areas were typically well out of the view of tourists anyway.</p>
        <p>''If there are cuts,'' he said, ''the Forest Service has made sure they can't be seen from passing cruise ships.''</p>
        <p>The lush growing areas most prized by logging companies, however, are precisely the same areas that are most critical for wildlife habitat, conservationists say. The region, roughly the size of West Virginia, has one of the largest concentrations of bald eagles and grizzly bears anywhere in the world and is also considered one of the largest stretches left of temperate (as opposed to tropical) rain forest.</p>
        <p>James Lyons, the assistant agriculture secretary in charge of the Forest Service, said the Tongass was exempted from a road ban under the recent proposal because it had already been subject to an intensive, yearslong review process that resulted in a 1997 ''management plan'' aimed at balancing wilderness protection with continued logging.</p>
        <p>Total logging in the forest now amounts to about 150 million board feet annually, having steadily dropped from a high of 590 million board feet in 1973. Environmental groups said that areas served by existing logging roads already provided enough land for a sustainable timber harvest, and that the road ban should be extended here.</p>
        <p>But Senator Murkowski said the logging statistics indicated that environmentalists had already gotten the upper hand in the Tongass.</p>
        <p>''Now they want it all,'' he said. ''Have you ever met with an environmental group that's satisfied? If they were satisfied, they wouldn't have a cause. They'd have to shut up shop and retire.''</p>
        <p>Logging industry officials also said they were extremely skeptical of environmentalists' claims that tourism would be the economic lifeblood of the area.</p>
        <p>''When they get finished shutting down logging, they're going to go after the cruise ships,'' said Jack Phelps, executive director of the Alaska Forest Association, a trade group based in Ketchikan. ''They think there're too many people coming here.''</p>
        <p>And, indeed, there is evidence that some Alaskans feel they are overrun with tourists: Juneau has slapped visitors' fees on those who arrive by boat, and Sitka residents voted down a proposal to build a dock that would have allowed more cruise ships to moor in town rather than out in the bay. (Many cruise ships offload their passengers onto smaller boats to bring them into town.)</p>
        <p>But Eric Jordan, a second-generation fisherman here in Sitka who also runs a guide business, said the local economy was stronger today than when the mill went out of business. The air and waters are much cleaner too, Mr. Jordan said.</p>
        <p>''When the mill actually closed and that cloud of smoke was lifted, both psychologically and literally, an amazing thing happened,'' he said. ''Property values shot up, and they've been going up ever since. The reality was more palatable than dealing with this constant threat that the economy would collapse if the mill went. I really think the psychology of the town has brightened in a lot of respects.''</p>
