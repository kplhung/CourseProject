        <p>Speaking to a Roman Catholic group, Gov. George W. Bush today took the side of the Vatican in a battle over its status at the United Nations, a clash that stems in large part from its stands in international disputes over family planning and abortion.</p>

        <p>Speaking to a Roman Catholic group, Gov. George W. Bush today took the side of the Vatican in a battle over its status at the United Nations, a clash that stems in large part from its stands in international disputes over family planning and abortion.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush, criticized during the Republican primary campaign for appearing at Bob Jones University, whose leaders have expressed anti-Catholic views, brought up the effort by a number of groups, many of them women's and health organizations that disagree with the church on abortion and family planning, to downgrade the Vatican's permanent-observer status.</p>
        <p>''In world affairs, the Holy See has long been an influence for the good, and never more than in the last couple of decades,'' said Mr. Bush, speaking by satellite hookup to the Catholic Press Association, which was meeting in Baltimore.</p>
        <p>''Some groups have been trying to silence that voice in the United Nations,'' he said. ''The position of the current administration is unclear. The position of my administration will be very clear and firm: America supports permanent-observer status for the Holy See.''</p>
        <p>But aides to both Vice President Al Gore and Richard C. Holbrooke, the United States' chief delegate to the United Nations, said Mr. Gore and the Clinton administration backed  the Vatican's permanent-observer status as well.</p>
        <p>''Bush is once again making foolish charges,'' said Douglas Hattaway, a spokesman for Mr. Gore.</p>
        <p>In his talk to the Catholic Press Association, Mr. Bush also spoke of compassion and values, his remarks sprinkled with quotations from both Pope John Paul II and Cardinal John O'Connor, the late archbishop of New York. ''A truly welcoming society must be a culture of life,'' the governor said, calling for the ''day when every child, born and unborn, is welcome in life and protected in law.''</p>
        <p>And he drew applause when he said he supported legislation to ban a kind of late-term abortion whose opponents refer to it as ''partial birth.''</p>
        <p>In response to a question, Mr. Bush defended Texas' record on executions, saying capital punishment, more common here than in any other state, ''sends a chilling message'' that deters crime. He said once again  that he knew of no one innocent whom the state had executed.</p>
        <p>As for the controversy over the Holy See, the Vatican has had special observer status at the United Nations since the organization's birth more than half a century ago. It cannot vote in the General Assembly, but it takes part as a full member nation in international conferences, where it has taken strong stands against contraception and abortion. Groups that have called for the Vatican to lose its special status argue that it is not a state, but rather a religious headquarters.</p>
        <p>Mr. Bush's aides said his comments today about the Clinton administration's position on the matter had been prompted by the United States mission's sponsoring a news conference in March by Catholics for Free Choice, a group seeking a review of the Vatican's status. A non-government organization, or N.G.O., has to be sponsored by a member nation in order to hold a news conference at the United Nations.</p>
        <p>Mary Ellen Glynn, a spokeswoman for Mr. Holbrooke, the chief United States delegate, said the mission also granted sponsorship the next day to another Catholic organization, which took the other side of the issue.</p>
        <p>''Our policy is to sponsor legitimate N.G.O.'s if they want to use the facilities -- nothing more, nothing less,'' Ms. Glynn said. ''It is a nonpartisan policy.''</p>
        <p>She said the administration supported the Vatican's status. ''We work very well with the Holy See on a variety of issues,'' she said.</p>
        <p>An aide to Mr. Bush who briefed reporters at the governor's campaign headquarters here said a Bush administration would not have given Catholics for Free Choice access to the United Nations. But this aide  spoke on the condition that he not be identified. Ari Fleischer, spokesman for the campaign, was less definitive, saying that if a Bush administration  sponsored such a group, Mr. Bush  ''would make clear he didn't share their point of view.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hattaway, speaking for Mr. Gore, said of Mr. Bush and his visit to Bob Jones University, ''If he's truly concerned about Catholics, why did he address a place that calls Catholicism a cult?''</p>
        <p>The controversy over Mr. Bush's campaign stop at Bob Jones, in South Carolina, was stoked by Senator John McCain, who was Mr. Bush's main rival for the Republican presidential nomination. Mr. Bush later wrote to Cardinal O'Connor to say he regretted not having used his appearance at Bob Jones to speak out against its leaders' views.</p>
