        <p>The Toshiba Corporation's settlement of a class-action lawsuit in the United States last year has backfired in China, where consumers are charging discrimination because the Japanese electronics maker has not offered them the same deal.</p>
        <p>Toshiba, the world's largest supplier of laptop computers, startled the industry last October by agreeing to pay American consumers as much as $2.1 billion in compensation for laptops made before November with a flawed computer chip that controls the floppy disk drive. The settlement was meant to head off potentially devastating damages from the class-action suit, which was brought by two Texans.</p>
        <p>The company also offered a software patch to fix the problem for Toshiba laptop owners worldwide, but that has not satisfied Chinese consumers, who are ever ready to discern a slight from their wartime aggressors. The Chinese want to be compensated, too, even though no lawsuit has yet been brought in China.</p>
        <p>''I feel quite angry, they're being very unreasonable,'' said Wang Jialiang, a Shanghai sales manager for Legend Holdings Ltd., Toshiba's only authorized distributor in China. Mr. Wang said he had e-mailed friends to spread the word of what he called Toshiba's misdeeds, and had even berated some Japanese. Toshiba is China's leading laptop supplier, having sold 200,000 of the machines in the country in the last five years.</p>
        <p>Resentment of Japan remains deep in China and commercial disputes between the two countries can quickly flare into nationalistic bickering. The Japanese are vilified on each anniversary of the Imperial Army's rape and massacre of civilians in Nanjing. And it is not uncommon for Chinese to tell Westerners of their hatred for Japanese.</p>
        <p>But besides the nationalistic sentiments involved, Toshiba's trouble here reflects the legal naivete of Chinese consumers in a country that is still developing the rule of law.</p>
        <p>The problem began when Toshiba failed to fix an error in the microcode of a chip designed by NEC. In rare circumstances, the flaw could cause users to lose data while saving it to a floppy disk, although Toshiba says it has not heard of that happening on any of the 15 million laptops it has sold worldwide.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, the company decided it would be better for public relations to settle the suit brought by the two men in Texas rather than go through a costly, drawn-out legal fight that it might lose.</p>
        <p>It was not long before word of the settlement was making its way through Chinese Web sites and chat rooms and Chinese indignation began to build. Earlier this month, China's state-run media picked up the complaint with headlines like ''No compensation angers Chinese.''</p>
        <p>This week, the company dispatched executives, including a vice president, Masaichi Koga, to Beijing to try to repair the damage. But the executives got little sympathy with their explanation that the flaw had not caused any data loss that the company was aware of and that the American settlement was a legal maneuver for that country only.</p>
        <p>''Toshiba has tried to save the situation, but they're using irresponsible methods,'' said an article in China Business Times on Tuesday. The China Consumer Journal dismissed the executives' efforts, saying ''Toshiba's apology was not sincere.''</p>
        <p>Toshiba's China headquarters in Beijing declined to comment other than to say through a spokesman that the company was still discussing the matter. But China's government-sponsored Consumers Association said Toshiba had violated China's consumer law with its delay in notifying Chinese consumers of the problem. The announcement and instructions for fixing the potential problem were posted in English on the company's Web sites but not until the controversy grew were they posted in Chinese.</p>
        <p>Several groups of Toshiba laptop owners in China are considering a lawsuit against the company, according to the state media. Sales of Toshiba laptops, meanwhile, have slumped. Mr. Wang of Legend said he was not pushing the brand and on occasion had even inflated the price to discourage people from buying the computers. ''I tell people to buy I.B.M. and H.P.,'' he said.</p>
