        <p>Proving once again that God has a sense of humor, Elian Gonzalez has landed in the most media-centric neighborhood on earth.</p>
        <p>The beast that has stalked the 6-year-old Cuban boy since his boat foundered in November -- the tall-mast television trucks and their cargoes of stand-up news personalities, and the federal marshals with their yellow barricade tape -- now lives on Newark Street in the Cleveland Park section of Washington.</p>
        <p>The beast and all it represents have brought, shall we say, concern to the leafy glade, home to an extraordinary concentration of prominent Washington editors, publishers, political figures and power brokers.</p>
        <p>''The neighbors are scared of the media frenzy that they had in Miami,'' said Derry Craig, who lives around the corner from Elian's new home, the Rosedale estate, which is owned by a foundation for exchange students, Youth for Understanding International Exchange.</p>
        <p>Ms. Craig's husband, Gregory, who was President Clinton's lawyer in the late unpleasantness of impeachment, and thus no stranger to such frenzies, took his clients, Elian and his father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, to Newark Street late Thursday night to begin their latest experience of America.</p>
        <p>Cleveland Park is not Miami. In fact, ''this is not America,'' said Debby Weil, a dot-com marketing manager who lives on Newark Street. ''It's an incredibly privileged, upper-percentile place'' -- Volvo station wagons, private schools, golden retrievers.</p>
        <p>The street is the heart of Cleveland Park, not Washington's richest or most exclusive neighborhood, but home to more than a few chieftains. Donald E. Graham, the publisher of The Washington Post; Jim Lehrer, the public television news anchor; David Ignatius, the next editor of The International Herald Tribune; Michael Oreskes, Washington bureau chief of The New York Times; Judy Woodruff of CNN and her husband, Al Hunt, of The Wall Street Journal, to name a few, are Elian's neighbors.</p>
        <p>Because the neighborhood is such a media-rich environment, ''there is mild amusement that the chickens have come home to roost,'' Ms. Weil said.</p>
        <p>Elian and his entourage will be staying indefinitely at Rosedale, a 1793 dwelling surrounded by a gorgeous greensward that was, until today, the neighborhood's public dog run.</p>
        <p>''That beautiful lawn was where we all walk our dogs,'' Ms. Weil said. ''The first thought was, Can we still walk our dogs?'' Yes, but only on a narrow strip between the yellow tape and the street, and only on a leash. So there was a muted howling at the dog run this morning, and it was not coming from the dogs.</p>
        <p>Directly across the street from Rosedale stands the home of a 47-year-old conservative pundit who frequently writes for The New Yorker and requested, no, insisted, on anonymity. He finds the arrival of Elian in his neighborhood -- where he says ''Dukakis for President'' bumper stickers still cling to those Volvos -- beyond satire.</p>
        <p>''The moment it was announced -- 'Guess who's coming to dinner!' -- all these Janet Reno devotees, who a month ago were saying, 'Good for Janet for getting him out,' are now singing a far different aria,'' the pundit said. ''Now that their little darling is in their backyards, the cry has gone up, 'What about the dogs?' ''</p>
        <p>A cynic (or a novelist) might foresee a turn in the neighbor's perception of the Elian event, he said, now that ''the billion-footed centipede is leaving droppings on their lawns.''</p>
        <p>A novelist, Ward Just, who has chronicled the political culture of Washington since the 1960's, foresaw exactly that.</p>
        <p>''I predict,'' Mr. Just said, tongue deeply embedded in cheek, ''many op-ed articles about the intrusiveness of the press, some written by newspapermen. There's going to be a lot of new interest in normalizing relations with Cuba. And if all else fails, they'll call for Reno's resignation.''</p>
