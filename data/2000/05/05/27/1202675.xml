        <p>Citing an injury to her left knee, Serena Williams withdrew from the French Open today shortly before the draw was conducted.</p>
        <p>It has been a tough year for the Williams sisters, who thrived on all surfaces and in all mediums in 1999. Because of tendinitis in her wrists, Venus Williams has played only four matches and has lost two of them. Serena Williams, the younger of the sisters and the reigning United States Open champion, has not played for more than a month.</p>
        <p>The French Open is set to begin  Monday, when fans will be able to see how the Roland Garros complex has been transformed in a hurry. The center court on which Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi surprised the tennis world, and themselves, by winning last year's singles titles, was partly torn down two weeks after their victories. It was rebuilt to create more comfortable and spacious environs for players and officials. The bad news is that there are now 1,000 fewer seats.</p>
        <p>''Each year the French seem to try something different here, to improve their facilities in one way or another,'' said Michael Chang, the 1989 French champion. ''It's unbelievable how they got this all up in 10 months.''</p>
        <p>Counting his victory here, Agassi has won three of the last four Grand Slam events, but his play has been listless in recent weeks. Even though he has a straightforward first-round match against a French wild card, Anthony Dupuis, it might be considered bold to pick the top-seeded player to defend his title here. To do so, he would have to beat the likes of Gustavo Kuerten, Alex Corretja, Dominik Hrbaty, Marat Safin, Cedric Pioline and Magnus Norman and what the French call ''les outsiders dangereux'' in the draw.</p>
        <p>It would require even more pluck to pick Pete Sampras to win the only Grand Slam trophy still missing from his Beverly Hills home. Even though he is capable of beating anyone on his least favorite surface -- witness that his victory over Norman on Thursday in Dusseldorf, Germany, came in the relatively meaningless World Team Cup -- he is also capable of faltering against anyone. And in the opening round, the second-seeded Sampras will face Mark Philippoussis. The hard-serving Australian was up a set on Sampras in the Wimbledon quarterfinals last year before being forced to retire with a knee injury. And for all of his natural force and taste for risk, Philippoussis is quite comfortable on clay and played brilliantly indoors on it during Australia's Davis Cup victory over France last December.</p>
        <p>Philippoussis is not seeded here because his recent form has been patchy, but then so has Sampras's. After an injury-forced layoff, he was beaten in straight sets last week in the German Open by Arnaud Di Pasquale of France. It was Sampras's only official clay-court tournament so far this year.</p>
        <p>And lurking in the third round in Sampras's section of the draw could be either Hicham Arazi, who usually saves his best for Roland Garros, or Markus Hipfl, a huffing, grunting, clay-loving Austrian.</p>
        <p>Besides Sampras-Philippoussis, there are other intriguing first-round matchups, including Marcelo Rios versus Tommy Haas; Kuerten versus Sweden's newest teenager with talent, Andres Vinciguerra; and Lleyton Hewitt, the Australian teenager who is seeded for the first time in a Grand Slam event, versus the feisty American veteran Jeff Tarango, who has played well of late.</p>
        <p>The women's draw has some first-round encounters worth underscoring. Jennifer Capriati, seeded 15th, could have difficulty against Colombia's Fabiola Zuluaga if she does not recover the fitness and consistency that were missing in Rome last week. Lindsay Davenport, seeded No. 2, could struggle against Dominique Van Roost if her injured back is not sufficiently healed to let her swing away with her customary force and confidence. Third-seeded Monica Seles also has a potentially tricky match against Silvija Talaja.</p>
        <p>A year ago, top-seeded Martina Hingis lost the final, her composure and a fair number of fans against Graf. Now, still seeded first, she has another chance to win it all, opening against Sabine Appelmans.</p>
