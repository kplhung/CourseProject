        <p>Carl Everett loves New York. Actually, he does not really love New York. Everett simply loves the results that he helped produce against the Yankees, a team that he hates as much as those annoying Mets and those ignorant people of New York. By the way, did you see that fan tumble out of the upper deck and onto the protective screen at Yankee Stadium last night?</p>
        <p>Last night, Everett could have gloated. He had a critical two-run single off David Cone, the Red Sox won, 4-1, behind Ramon Martinez and not even the usually creative fans in the right-field bleachers irritated Everett. Everett challenged them to be more artistic, but not as foolish as the 24-year-old who some witnesses said jumped over the railing.</p>
        <p>So this was the night for Everett to continue his verbal assault against the Yankees. He considers the Yankees an ordinary team basically devoid of superstars and he has spiced up this rivalry by criticizing them and Derek Jeter and Paul O'Neill. But, with three dozen reporters in front of him in the clubhouse, Everett shrewdly decided to be boring when he had every reason to boast.</p>
        <p>''It's no different than any other game,'' Everett said. ''It's nothing extra special. Maybe for our fans, it's extra special. For me, it's just one more step in pursuing what we want to get to.''</p>
        <p>Everett has made the Red Sox a more interesting team and a more dangerous team, a team that will shadow the Yankees all season. The Red Sox do not have as much talent as the two-time World Series champions, but they have enough talent, they are resilient and they believe they can beat the Yankees. Like Everett, who believes it more than anyone else, the Red Sox see the Yankees as vulnerable and they should.</p>
        <p>There were two sequences that capsized the Yankees, and Everett was pivotal in both. After Cone speared Brian Daubach's grounder with runners on first and third and one out in the first, he inexplicably failed to toss to second for a possible double play. Cone should have been resting in the dugout. Instead, he was facing one of the premier hitters in the American League with two runners in scoring position.</p>
        <p>The misplay would haunt Cone and help Everett. Cone tossed a split-finger fastball on a 1-1 count and Everett looped it into center field to deliver two runs and quickly take the 54,470 fans out of the game.</p>
        <p>There was enthusiasm at Yankee Stadium, but it dissipated after the Red Sox took an early lead. Everett was the reason for that. ''I think that Coney forgot about the guy on first base,'' Everett said. ''He probably would have gone for the double play. It worked out for us.''</p>
        <p>Everett played shallow in center, which also contributed to hampering the Yankees. With runners on first and second in the fifth, Ricky Ledee singled to center. Chris Turner stopped at third, but Clay Bellinger thought the catcher would try to score and churned toward third. Everett rushed the ball into the infield and Bellinger was tagged out, helping throttle a rally.</p>
        <p>Even though Everett has been critical of the Yankees since spring training and curiously warned fans not to ''put your hands on me,'' fans were not so vocal toward the 28-year-old center fielder. They booed Everett, but it was not louder than what Albert Belle hears. The fans in the right-field bleachers, who were not allowed to buy beer as a new policy was instituted last night, chanted, ''Alimony, alimony,'' in reference to Everett's being divorced, but he smiled at the taunting.</p>
        <p>''It's the same thing I heard when I was playing here,'' he said. ''It didn't bother me. Being booed or heckled doesn't get to me. I like hecklers when they have a point. Tonight was the same boring stuff.''</p>
        <p>Everett kept repeating that it was not a pivotal victory for the Red Sox. The Yankees drafted him in the first round in 1990 and Everett has said that they wanted him to fail, serious allegations, but they did not reach Manager Jimy Williams's desk.</p>
        <p>Asked if Everett has a passion for beating the Yankees, he said: ''This kid plays hard every day. I have no idea what you're talking about.''</p>
        <p>Cone and the Yankees lamented their missed opportunities after dropping a game behind the Red Sox on a night when a fan seemingly fell from the sky.</p>
        <p>As the players showered and left, General Manager Brian Cashman huddled with Ledee. Ledee knows George Steinbrenner has been upset with his production, but Cashman wanted to assure him that he was still important to New York's plans.</p>
        <p>''He pointed out Carl and said, 'We let him go and he came back and look what happened,' '' Ledee explained. ''We don't want you to go anywhere and get us back.''</p>
        <p>With Everett, it is too late.</p>
