        <p>Saul P. Steinberg, a corporate raider famous for trying but failing to acquire such big-name companies as Walt Disney and Chemical Bank, announced yesterday what amounts to a final withdrawal from a flamboyant career.</p>
        <p>Reliance Group Holdings, the insurance company that had supported Mr. Steinberg's corporate sallies for three decades, is being sold to the Leucadia National Corporation for $295 million in stock and the assumption of $735 million in debt. The company had suffered big losses recently.</p>
        <p>Once the sale is approved by regulators, Mr. Steinberg, who is 60, will no longer control any American company. ''He will continue to be active in business and philanthropic affairs,'' a Reliance spokesman said, ''although he has not made any specific plans.''</p>
        <p>The sale will bring him $93 million in Leucadia stock, if he still owns the 36.4 million Reliance shares listed in his name last Dec. 31. But his fortune has clearly shrunk. The 36.4 million shares were worth $364 million a year ago.</p>
        <p>At a Sotheby's auction yesterday Mr. Steinberg and his wife, Gayfryd, sold $12 million worth of his personal belongings, mostly sterling silver and other furnishings from his 34-room Park Avenue apartment, itself sold in March for more than $30 million. Mr. Steinberg is also selling a collection of paintings.</p>
        <p>The Reliance sale will bring 0.11 of a share of Leucadia stock for each Reliance share.</p>
        <p>That values Reliance at $2.55 a share, or less than a third of the stock's $10 value when Mr. Steinberg took Reliance public in 1986. Most of the debt being assumed by Leucadia, an investment company whose holdings include insurance companies, is due this year.</p>
        <p>''We did a thorough review and careful deliberation, and concluded that this was the best decision for our shareholders and customers,'' the Reliance spokesman said.</p>
        <p>Reliance, based in New York, with 3,000 employees, reported an operating loss of $318.3 million last year, and $36.5 million in this year's first quarter. Recent blows included a major setback in a workers' compensation insurance arrangement that went sour. Mr. Steinberg stepped down as chief executive in late February, on the day Reliance announced the sale of its profitable ''crown jewel,'' a surety unit, for $580 million.</p>
        <p>Those were the final chapters of a career that began to soar in 1961 when Mr. Steinberg, only 22 years old, pioneered the computer leasing business, and his new company, named Leasco, quickly reported a profit. The young entrepreneur took Leasco public in 1965 and the stock rose, giving Mr. Steinberg the wherewithal in 1968 to take over Reliance, a prosperous insurance company nearly 10 times Leasco's size.</p>
        <p>That turned out to be Mr. Steinberg's only significant takeover. His disastrous attempt to acquire Chemical Bank in 1969 failed when Leasco's stock came under attack. And his subsequent attempts over the years to get control of Walt Disney  and other big companies were no more successful, although he often walked away from these raids richer for the investments.</p>
