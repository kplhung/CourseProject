        <p>After spending several weeks watching his opponent grab headlines and project a more moderate image, Vice President Al Gore is embarking on a new campaign strategy that will blend personal, biographical details with policy matters in his ongoing effort to reach voters on a human level.</p>
        <p>On Saturday, Mr. Gore is to give the commencement address to the 944 cadets graduating from the United States Military Academy at West Point. Aides said he would discuss both his plans for military preparedness and his experience as an Army enlistee in Vietnam.</p>
        <p>He is expected to elaborate on his Army experience on Monday, Memorial Day, in a speech in western Pennsylvania. On Wednesday, he plans to hold a conference on mental health with his wife, Tipper, who has battled depression.</p>
        <p>On Thursday he is to give a major speech on cancer research at a time when scientists are completing work on the human genome project, a long-running interest of Mr. Gore's.  And on Friday he will speak about the responsibility of fathers.</p>
        <p>''Part of running for the presidency is introducing yourself to the American people,'' said Chris Lehane, the vice president's press secretary. ''People want to know about the experiences that influenced his thinking.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has been introducing and reintroducing himself for some months, but some of his advisers worry that there is still a gap in voters' knowledge about him and that this is hurting him in comparisons with Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, his Republican rival.</p>
        <p>As a result, the Gore campaign and the Democratic National Committee are preparing television commercials, largely biographical, for which he has been taping scenes over the last few weeks. They will highlight his experiences outside of Washington, including his time in Tennessee as a divinity student and a journalist, and his family, including the fact that he has been married 30 years and is a new grandfather.</p>
        <p>''Vice presidents are famous but not well known,'' Mr. Lehane said. ''Most people's notion of him is standing behind a podium.''</p>
        <p>Elaine Kamark, Mr. Gore's domestic policy adviser, noted that since 1992 he has held annual conferences on topics related to the family, like medical care for children and stresses on the modern family. She said these policy discussions brought out the best in the vice president, and gave the greatest insight into both his character and his views about what was important.</p>
        <p>Ms. Kamark said these family issues ''combine both policy and his personal experiences as a parent, and you get a sense of how he would use the bully pulpit'' as president.</p>
        <p>Today Mr. Gore spent the day at the Cordova School, a 1,120-student magnet school here outside Memphis, his sixth such visit to schools around the country since the end of the primary season in March. His main message today, as it has been during previous school visits, was to emphasize the involvement of parents in their children's lives. The level of detail into which he becomes engrossed was evident in his response to a question about the behavior of children on school buses.</p>
        <p>''One of the school bus drivers in a school in North Carolina made a suggestion that might go to your question,'' Mr. Gore said. ''He said that when children bring home their report cards on how they are doing in their course work that they ought to get a grade in bus.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore's West Point appearance this weekend has prompted criticism from another veteran who wonders where the line is between allowing a vice president to address the academy if he is also a political candidate.</p>
        <p>Bob Dole, a World War II veteran who was the Republican presidential nominee in 1996, was invited informally five years ago to deliver a speech at the academy, Doug MacKinnon, Mr. Dole's spokesman, said in an interview. But Mr. MacKinnon  said the invitation was withdrawn ''at the last minute'' because it was deemed political. The academy, which allowed members of Congress to speak on the campus in the 1800's, now allows only the president, the vice president and the speaker of the House to address the cadets.</p>
        <p>''We have no ill will toward anyone,'' Mr. MacKinnon said. ''We just want to try to get clarification on the policy, what the rules are, who created the exceptions, why the Senate majority leader isn't on the list.''</p>
        <p>Maj. James Whaley, a spokesman for West Point, said in an interview that ''speaking at graduation is normally reserved for the president, vice president or speaker of the House, and Mr. Dole was a senator.''</p>
        <p>Asked how those who attend the ceremony might distinguish Mr. Gore the vice president from Mr. Gore the presidential candidate, Major Whaley said the vice president's right to speak ''to future leaders of our nation and our Army'' cannot be taken away from him because he is aspiring to higher office.</p>
        <p>The question by Republicans about Mr. Gore's appearance at the military academy seemed more of a warning than concern about the past, putting Mr. Gore and his campaign on notice that, say, using the platform of a service academy commencement, either for television commercials or political remarks, would cross a line.</p>
