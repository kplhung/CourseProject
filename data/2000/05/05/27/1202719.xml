        <p>New York Jets sign draft-pick Anthony Becht (S)</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>The Jets wasted little time in tackling the unprecedented task of signing their four first-round draft picks, signing tight end Anthony Becht yesterday. Becht was the first of the Jets' four first-rounders and only the second first-round selection -- after the first overall pick, Courtney Brown, of Cleveland -- to reach a deal. Becht, from West Virginia, was the Jets' fourth first-round pick and the 27th player selected over all. Becht's deal is for five years and, according to his agent, is front-loaded with signing, workout and roster cash bonuses with guaranteed money later, which fulfills two needs: to give Becht cash now, and to help the Jets' dire salary cap circumstances.</p>
