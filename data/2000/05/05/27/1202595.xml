        <p>Just a few years ago Moscow seemed a natural venue for this week's annual International PEN Congress, an event that has drawn writers from around the world pledged to fight the good fight for freedom of expression.</p>
        <p>Back then, Russian writers, some of them heroes of past PEN campaigns, were still giddy from the collapse of Communist censorship, and their Western colleagues were eager to honor the young Russian PEN club, founded in 1992, and boost its status as a beachhead for Russia's new freedoms.</p>
        <p>Now, the glow from those early years of democratic euphoria has faded. Russia is no longer in fashion in Western intellectual circles. Quite the contrary, Russia is back in the dock, this time not for Communist repression but for a brutal war in Chechnya.</p>
        <p>The eight-month war, Russia's second in the region, initiated by President Vladimir V. Putin when he was Prime Minister and largely supported by public opinion, cast a pall over preparations for the first PEN Congress to be held in Moscow. As writers and intellectuals reacted with horror to stories of indiscriminate bombing, rape and pillage by Russian troops, several national PEN centers protested against holding the Congress in Moscow and threatened to withdraw their delegations.</p>
        <p>''We had serious concerns about the Moscow conference, since there is no tradition of the PEN club organizing its congress in a country which is waging war,'' said Adam Pomorski, vice president of the Polish PEN club. ''With our presence, we could demonstrate support for one side or another in the conflict. It would be the same as if, let us say, we had held a congress in Belgrade during the conflict in Bosnia or Kosovo.''</p>
        <p>The final decision to go ahead with the congress, which ends here on Sunday, was made by the Russian PEN club, whose members have also vigorously protested the war in Chechnya. ''They were certain that in order to uphold the ideals of PEN, it was in fact essential to hold the conference in Moscow,'' said Jane Spender, secretary of PEN International. ''To withdraw at this point would have left the Russian PEN center painfully exposed.''</p>
        <p>And so the conference has unfolded this week, with delegates from 74 of the International PEN's 130 centers present and the war in Chechnya getting much attention. Today the congress's official delegates adopted a resolution, drafted by the Russian PEN center, condemning the Russian government's attempts to ''resolve the tragic situation in Chechnya by military means.''</p>
        <p>Also on the agenda was a much more strongly worded declaration, drafted by PEN centers from Central Europe and the former Soviet Union, accusing Russia of genocide in Chechnya and of clamping down on independent news media that have resisted the government's propaganda line.</p>
        <p>In an opening speech, Gunter Grass, the German novelist and Nobel laureate, called on the Russian government to end ''the war against the Chechen people,'' which he said had been waged ''once again, as earlier, without reason without mercy.'' He called for a United Nations investigation into war crimes committed by both sides.</p>
        <p>But mainly he appealed to writers to speak out against tyranny, and to expose lies. Writers, he said, were often the first to resist ''the changing ideological temptations of the 20th century,'' whether in Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia. Literature, he said, ''does not turn a blind eye, it does not forget, it does break the silence.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Grass's speech and the focus on Chechnya have received mixed reviews here, where some Russian writers and newspapers are chafing at what they see as the West's relentless criticism -- and not only of the war -- which some feel has taken on a hostile, anti-Russian tone.</p>
        <p>''I too am outraged by the war in Chechnya, but now the word Soviet is being replaced by the word Russian, and I also don't like it,'' said Andrei Bitov, a renowned Russian writer and president of the Russian PEN center. ''I feel there is a certain nostalgia for the 'enemy' and a lowering of the Iron Curtain from the other side.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Bitov, author of ''Pushkin House'' and other novels, said he first began to sense a shift in attitudes last year, when on his trips abroad he found himself being made to answer for Russia's stance against NATO action in Kosovo.</p>
        <p>''What I don't like is that as a private person, I was made to feel responsible,'' he said. ''There is a kind of snobbism to some of the criticism, and this readiness to call everyone a fascist.''</p>
        <p>The most outrageous example, Mr. Bitov said, came at a PEN conference at which Lev Timofeyev, a Russian dissident who in Soviet times spent 10 years in jail, was told that to hold the PEN congress in Moscow now would be like holding it in Hitler's Germany. ''This is not a fascist country,'' Mr. Bitov said.</p>
        <p>Several Russian writers said that the local PEN center had received ''hints'' from the Russian authorities that the International PEN Conference might turn into a ''political provocation'' that might best be avoided. In the end nothing was done to prevent its being held here, but the Russian government, unlike governments of other host countries, also did nothing to support it.</p>
        <p>''We in Russian PEN have become hostages of East and West at the same moment,'' Mr. Bitov said. ''But the great thing is that we managed to have the congress anyway.''</p>
        <p>For some Russian writers who remember the days when anonymous censors could strike words and phrases from their books or even ban them altogether, holding the conference here, and airing criticism of the government's conduct of the Chechen war, is what PEN is all about.</p>
        <p>''It is right that this conference should be about Chechnya, and it is right that it should be held here,'' said Andrei Voznesensky, a poet and vice president of Russian PEN. ''It is a war that worries foreigners, and it worries us. But it is a good thing that they can come here and we can all say what we think.''</p>
