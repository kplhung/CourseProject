        <p>The head of the Organization of American States observation team, saying he had been deceived by Peruvian officials, angrily left Peru today, two days before the presidential runoff election that he was supposed to monitor to guarantee against vote fraud.</p>
        <p>''The conditions of the election do not provide a strong basis of legitimacy,'' said the organization's chief, Eduardo Stein, who has been the senior foreign observer of a process that has been tainted with allegations of dirty tricks and fraud. ''I feel deceived and disappointment.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stein's views will be crucial as his organization and the Clinton administration and the United States Congress consider applying economic sanctions on the government of President Alberto K. Fujimori. In a report released late Thursday, after the government's announcement that it would not postpone the runoff on Sunday, Mr. Stein's team offered a stinging rebuke.</p>
        <p>''The Peruvian electoral process is far from one that could be considered free and fair,'' the observation team said.</p>
        <p>The team then ordered its election observers to leave Peru.</p>
        <p>Mr. Fujimori's election to a third five-year term was effectively assured when his opponent, Alejandro Toledo, dropped out of the race last week, saying that he was not ready to enter ''a butcher shop'' of fraud in a fixed election.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Stein, with Washington's full backing, tried to mediate a solution between Mr. Toledo and the government in which the election could be postponed to give foreign observers ample time to test computer programs to make sure that the count would be transparent and clean.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stein, a former foreign minister of Guatemala, led the international criticism of the first-round balloting, on April 9, saying, ''Something sinister is happening here,'' as ballots and tally sheets disappeared for hours without explanation and votes were counted in undisclosed locations. Mr. Fujimori fell just short of winning an outright majority victory in that round, according to an official tabulation made over three days as the United States and other countries pressed for a runoff.</p>
        <p>Since that round, Mr. Stein has been cajoling the government to stop spending public money in the Fujimori campaign and open television networks to covering the opposition. He has had limited success.</p>
        <p>In the last few days, Mr. Stein had expressed renewed optimism that an agreement could be worked out, with a new date to be set on June 4 or some weeks later. Negotiations had reached the level where Mr. Fujimori was talking directly by telephone with Cesar Gaviria, head of the Organization of American States and a former president of Colombia,  Peruvian officials said.</p>
        <p>Mr. Stein said he saw strong indications that the government would postpone the election as late as midday Thursday, before he was shocked by the news in the afternoon that the National Elections Commission voted, 3 to 2, against a postponement. ''We were led to believe that there was going to be a favorable outcome,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The decision was met with an increase in violent demonstrations across Peru, including a rock and gasoline bomb attack on the presidential palace by protesters late Thursday.</p>
        <p>In a television interview today, Mr. Fujimori brushed aside Mr. Stein's complaints. ''Globalization does not mean there can be unlimited intervention in a country's internal affairs,'' he said. ''The software problems have been resolved. There will be no fraud.''</p>
