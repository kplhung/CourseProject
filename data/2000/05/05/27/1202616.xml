        <p>Across upstate New York, Indians from the six nations of the Haudenosaunee, or Iroquois, are becoming impatient with the slow resolution of claims for return of land taken from us illegally after 1790. A claim by the Oneidas for 900 acres near Oneida Lake is finally heading to trial, but Seneca and Mohawk cases are crawling through the legal system, and an Onondaga claim is expected this year.</p>
        <p>All the Iroquois hope this story won't be $24 worth of beads Part II. But if one case that has actually gone to trial is an indication, we can hardly count on it.</p>
        <p>In January, a federal jury awarded the Cayugas, another Iroquois nation, just $36.9 million for 64,000 acres of land. The Cayugas had claimed a loss of $2 billion. The United States, suing on their behalf, had estimated their claim at $335 million. But the jury awarded even less than the $51.9 million offered by the state in settlement negotiations, confirming the bitterness of those who call it impossible for indigenous people to get justice in America's courts.</p>
        <p>The case is not over. A second phase of the trial begins in July, and there are ample grounds for modification of the award. But the results so far are discouraging.</p>
        <p>Historically, the Cayugas numbered about 1,000 and lived in the Finger Lakes area of central New York. On the land they claim, about 10,000 people, mostly white, now live in small towns and on farms.</p>
        <p>After the Revolutionary War, the new State of New York, seeking land to give to men who had fought against the British, coerced the Iroquois into signing treaties intended to extinguish our land titles. But those treaties were in violation of federal law.</p>
        <p>In 1790, Congress had passed the Nonintercourse Act, prohibiting and invalidating all Indian land transactions not made under the authority of the federal government. New York ignored the law and took millions of acres with no federal oversight. Some Iroquois retained small reservations, but the Cayugas were coerced into selling all their land, for as little as $1.50 per acre. They scattered, hoping someday they might return.</p>
        <p>In 1974, the Supreme Court ruled that the Oneidas could sue for violations of the Nonintercourse Act. In 1980, the Cayugas, building on this precedent, filed their suit, and in 1989, a federal court said they had a valid claim. The remaining question was the appropriate remedy.</p>
        <p>The Cayugas sought not only damages, but the return of their land and the removal of all trespassers. But thousands of those living in the claim area mobilized to oppose the establishment of any new Cayuga homeland, and last summer the court ruled that removal of trespassers was not an ''equitable'' remedy.</p>
        <p>The theory of justice embraced thus far by federal, state and local officials is that the Cayugas should be paid some amount of money with which they can try to buy their own land back from people who do not want them to have any of it.</p>
        <p>It is hard to imagine another issue that forces Americans to confront their sinful past quite like an Indian land claim. The trespassing non-Indians in Cayuga territory protest that it was not they, but the state, 200 years ago, that caused this problem. They are technically right. But they are still residing on someone else's land.</p>
        <p>After two centuries of aggression that led to the near-demise of the Cayugas as a people, justice requires more than handing them a check and wishing them luck. It requires that the wrongdoer, the state, give them back enough land and enough of a financial settlement to allow them to rebuild their nation.</p>
        <p>As in Northern Ireland, leaders on both sides need to emerge to build peace plans between New York and the Iroquois. But before that can happen, state and federal officials must find the political courage to tell the whites living on Indian land that the original owners continue to have a valid legal right to it.</p>
