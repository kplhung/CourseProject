        <p>Brian Carcaterra would crouch outside the box scraped in chalk on the concrete wall of his family's country store in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., and wait. Clutching a battered stick, in nothing but a T-shirt and shorts, the fourth grader lunged as his two older brothers pounded balls past and sometimes into his unprotected head. They needed lacrosse practice. He was the younger brother. It was a natural fit.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't intimidating because I didn't know any better,'' said Carcaterra, the John Hopkins senior goalie, grinning. ''When I got older and learned more about the game, I realized how insane I had been.''</p>

        <p>Brian Carcaterra would crouch outside the box scraped in chalk on the concrete wall of his family's country store in Yorktown Heights, N.Y., and wait. Clutching a battered stick, in nothing but a T-shirt and shorts, the fourth grader lunged as his two older brothers pounded balls past and sometimes into his unprotected head. They needed lacrosse practice. He was the younger brother. It was a natural fit.</p>
        <p>''It wasn't intimidating because I didn't know any better,'' said Carcaterra, the John Hopkins senior goalie, grinning. ''When I got older and learned more about the game, I realized how insane I had been.''</p>
        <p>The two older brothers, Paul and Steve, became all-Americans at Syracuse and Towson. The 5-foot- 8-inch, 165-pound goalie is second in career saves for the Blue Jays with 680 and will be starting today at noon when No. 4 Johns Hopkins (9-3) meets No. 1 Syracuse (13-1) at the University of Maryland in the semifinals of the National Collegiate Athletic Association playoffs.</p>
        <p>The defending national champion, No. 2 Virginia (13-1), will meet No. 3 Princeton (11-2) in the second game. The Blue Jays have lost to each of the final four teams, including a 13-12 loss to Syracuse on March 17 as they stumbled to an early 1-3 record, the losses compounded by Carcaterra's streaky final season.</p>
        <p>Carcaterra is an unorthodox, unusually athletic goalie who sprints eagerly out of the net, scooping up balls and then squeezing past opponents and teammates before passing from far downfield. When his college coaches first saw him darting out of the goal they were ''a little nervous,'' he said. ''They were like, 'What are you doing?' I tried to explain to them that I was capable.''</p>
        <p>After awhile, they believed him. He was named a first-team all-American in 1998 and a second-team all-American last year.</p>
