        <p>JAPAN: PREMIER APOLOGIZES -- Prime Minister Yoshiro Mori apologized for remarks last week that seemed to endorse emperor worship. After several days of heavy criticism, Mr. Mori, left, expressed regret in a tense news conference that his remarks had caused misunderstanding, but declined to retract his statement altogether. In his original remarks, which critics said echoed Japan's prewar militarism, Mr. Mori said Japan was ''a divine nation with the emperor at its core.''</p>

        <p>SRI LANKA: MILITARY PLEA -- The government asked retired officers and policemen to re-enlist in the armed forces in hopes of bolstering 30,000 troops under assault from separatist ethnic Tamils in the northern Jaffna Peninsula. Those who rejoined would take the noncombat positions of younger soldiers, who would then be shifted to the front lines. The rebels threatened a bloodbath for soldiers who failed to surrender by today.</p>

        <p>AFGHANISTAN: ARMS BLAST -- An ammunition depot at a Taliban military base in Kabul exploded close to a residential area, but no casualties were reported. Officials accused the northern opposition forces led by Ahmad Shah Masood of sabotage, but an opposition official denied the charge.</p>

        <p>AFGHANISTAN: RUSSIAN WARNING -- The commander of Russia's border guards warned that Moscow risks destabilizing part of Central Asia if it attacks outposts of Afghanistan's Taliban, which is accused of training Chechen rebels. Gen. Konstantin Totsky said the attacks could provoke violence in Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, two Russian allies that are Afghanistan's neighbors. The Taliban has said it would hold the two states liable for any Russian attacks.</p>
        <p>Michael Wines (NYT)</p>
        <p>CHINA: OPTIMISM ON TAIWAN -- After talks with Chinese military leaders and diplomats, an American official is hopeful China and Taiwan can resume a dialogue over their differences. ''My sense is that there's a genuine desire for a solution,'' said the official, who is based in Beijing and spoke on condition he not be identified. He added that there had been no official change in China's policy that Taiwan accept it is part of China, but ''somewhere in China's position there's room for dialogue to start.''</p>

        <p>NORTH KOREA: PLEA FOR AID -- North Korea plans to ask donor countries for $250 million to help people suffering from hunger and to achieve self-sufficiency in food supplies by 2002, said David Morton, the top United Nations official in the country. Mr. Morton said North Korean officials would present a plan on June 20 to build up its agricultural sector and reforest areas stripped of trees.</p>

        <p>CANADA: E. COLI INQUEST -- Ontario's coroner's office will open an inquest into the deaths of five people in an outbreak of E. coli bacteria in Walkerton, west of Toronto. The outbreak, from polluted water, sickened 10 percent of the town's 5,000 people. Dr. Murray McQuigge, the local medical officer, has charged that the local water company knew on May 18 that the water was potentially contaminated but maintained through May 21 that it was safe.</p>

        <p>MEXICO: TEACHERS PROTEST -- Some 20,000 schoolteachers seeking a wage increase blocked Mexico City's main street for 12 hours during a march to Ernesto Zedillo's presidential compound, where they were blocked by hundreds of riot policemen. Thousands of teachers from several states have been camped in parks and on sidewalks for a week as they press their salary demands, a yearly ritual.</p>

        <p>SURINAME: MIXED RESULTS -- The opposition New Front coalition failed to win enough seats to form a government as voters punished President Jules Wijdenbosch's poor economic record. With 85 percent of votes counted, the New Front was projected to win 33 seats in the 51-member National Assembly, one short of the two-thirds majority needed to appoint a president.</p>
        <p>(Reuters)</p>
        <p>EUROPE</p>
        <p>IRELAND: EX-PREMIER CONDEMNED -- On a state visit to Poland, Prime Minister Bertie Ahern sharply criticized former Prime Minister and Fianna Fail party leader Charles Haughey, 74, saying his behavior ''offends against the ethics and integrity of what our party stands for.'' A tribunal will call Mr. Haughey, 74, to testify after amassing evidence of almost $10 million he received between 1979 and 1996 in gifts, party donations and written-off bank loans.</p>

        <p>MIDDLE EAST</p>
        <p>IRAN: HARD-LINE PLEA -- In a speech that appeared to be a plea for peace with the new reformist Parliament, which convenes today, a senior hard-line cleric asked legislators to solve their differences privately. ''We must solve our problems among ourselves,'' said Ayatollah Ahmad Janati, head of the Council of Guardians, an election watchdog. ''We must talk privately and avoid causing worry in the mind of the public. National unity must be preserved.''</p>

        <p>FIJI: GUN BATTLE -- Government soldiers exchanged gunfire with ethnic Fijian rebels trying to overrun a roadblock near Parliament, where about 60 gunmen have been holding Prime Minister Mahendra Chaudhry, an ethnic Indian, and more than 30 members of his government hostage since May 19. Two soldiers were wounded, and a cameraman for Associated Press Television News was shot in the arm.</p>

        <p>AFRICA</p>
        <p>ZIMBABWE: PROTESTER KILLED -- Paramilitary police fired tear gas and live rounds over a group of governing party supporters trying to storm a police station to free 19 people arrested in earlier violence, the authorities said. One man, who was hit by a tear gas canister, died. It was the first death of a member of the ruling party in political violence that began in February, after President Robert Mugabe lost a bid to strengthen his powers and seize white-owned land.</p>
        <p>(AP)</p>
        <p>RWANDA: GENOCIDE TERM CUT -- A former Rwandan mayor convicted in Switzerland for crimes committed during the 1994 Rwanda genocide had his life sentence cut to 14 years. A Geneva appeals court reduced the term given to Fulgence Niyonteze, while agreeing he had incited Hutu extremists to kill Tutsi and supplied them with weapons. Mr. Niyonteze fled to Switzerland, and he was the first Rwandan suspected of genocide to be judged by a foreign country's court.</p>
