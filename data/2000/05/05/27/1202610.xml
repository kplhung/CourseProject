        <p>The Justice Department denounced the Microsoft Corporation today, accusing the company of cynical, irresponsible behavior on the last day of its antitrust trial. The department also filed a modified version of its proposal to break up the company that includes a handful of small, technical changes that the judge had requested.</p>
        <p>Microsoft plans to file a response to the form, but not the substance, of the revised proposal on Wednesday. Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson's final ruling in the long-running antitrust case will most likely come a day or two after that.</p>
        <p>That prospect prompted Microsoft to say today that it was postponing a major event at the company's campus in Redmond, Wash., at which Microsoft leaders were to describe their visions of the computing future. It had been scheduled for Thursday, but was put off for three weeks because ''there are strong indications'' that Judge Jackson will rule next week, a press release said.</p>
        <p>The government's revised remedy proposal still requests a breakup of the company and additional restrictions on conduct, as originally proposed on April 28. The changes are corrections of typographical errors and small alterations of language to address concerns the judge raised in court last Wednesday.</p>
        <p>In that hearing, on the trial's last day, the judge strongly suggested that he was leaning toward breaking up the company. And Microsoft expressed surprise and disappointment when the judge announced that he would not hold a separate phase of the trial to consider a remedy -- complete with depositions, witnesses and document requests. John Warden, a Microsoft lawyer, told Judge Jackson he found the idea ''that we would have some final resolution today really incredible.''</p>
        <p>But in a six-page brief filed along with its revised remedy proposal this afternoon, the Justice Department called that ''just a cynical ploy calculated to raise diversionary issues on appeal.''</p>
        <p>At the end of the day on Wednesday, the brief noted, Microsoft entered into evidence an ''offer of proof'' listing 16 academic experts and Microsoft executives who would have been called as witnesses if remedy hearings had been held, including the company chairman, William H. Gates. A short time later, company representatives also handed out dozens of copies to reporters.</p>
        <p>The government's brief went on to say: ''The fact that Microsoft had prepared but kept secreted in its briefcases a 35-page offer of proof, concerning testimony from 16 different witnesses that it allegedly wanted to offer, itself demonstrates both that Microsoft was not genuinely surprised about what was expected of it and that it was perfectly capable of being forthright with the court but chose not to do so.''</p>
        <p>A Microsoft spokesman, Mark Murray, called the government brief ''unfortunate'' and said company officials had been genuinely surprised to learn that the judge planned no additional hearings.</p>
        <p>On April 3, Judge Jackson found Microsoft in wide violation of federal and state antitrust laws. The next day, at a conference in his chambers, he told lawyers for both sides that he wanted to conclude the proceedings quickly. But the judge's remarks on scheduling issues were in some ways contradictory.</p>
        <p>He said emphatically that he intended to wrap up the remedy process within 60 days, by the end of May, saying: ''What I do not want is to have caused this thing to drag on through a number of months of additional proceedings.''</p>
        <p>However, Mr. Warden, the Microsoft lawyer, asked him: ''Does your honor contemplate further proceedings of some kind or another after the conclusion of this schedule?'' And the judge responded: ''Yes. I would assume that there would be further proceedings.''</p>
        <p>The Justice Department brief asserts that Microsoft knew for months that the government was likely to request a breakup of the company ''and has had ample opportunity'' to express its concerns. It said the company could have filed the statements from Mr. Gates and the others with its own proposed remedy on May 10, letting the judge know that Mr. Gates wanted to testify. Instead, Microsoft's lawyers waited until after the judge declared that there would be no more hearings.</p>
        <p>The government's evident suspicion from this is that the offer of proof was not entirely genuine. But Mr. Murray reiterated today that Microsoft had no idea that the trial would end on Wednesday. Company lawyers brought along the offer of proof just out of a sense of due diligence -- for the off-chance that the judge chose to close the record.</p>
        <p>Had there been further hearings at which Mr. Gates testified, the Justice Department could have subpoenaed additional e-mail messages and other documents from him relating to the remedy question. Some of his e-mail messages obtained earlier and shown during the trial undercut the company's defense.</p>
        <p>The government would also have been able to depose Mr. Gates and cross-examine him on the stand. In his videotaped deposition in preparation for the trial, in August 1998, Mr. Gates was halting and forgetful as he slumped in his chair. His performance did not help the company's case, and may have done damage.</p>
        <p>The time to offer Mr. Gates's testimony, the government said, should have been on May 10, the date the judge set for receiving Microsoft's opinions on remedies.</p>
        <p>Mr. Murray responded today: ''That kind of attitude is completely unfortunate and completely groundless when you look at the facts. Microsoft lived up to its obligations in good faith, 100 percent.''</p>
