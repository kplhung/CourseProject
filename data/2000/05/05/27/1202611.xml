        <p>Echoing church teachings in the face of heightened national attention to the death penalty, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Los Angeles has urged Gov. Gray Davis of California to impose a moratorium on executions in the state and to appoint a bipartisan commission to conduct a ''comprehensive and objective study'' of a capital punishment system that he called ''fatally flawed.''</p>
        <p>''I believe that an objective study will provide substantial factual data to support moral and ethical questions raised by the Catholic bishops of California and the United States regarding the death penalty,'' the archbishop, Cardinal Roger Mahony, wrote in a letter to Mr. Davis that was made public on Thursday, when Cardinal Mahony elaborated on his comments in a speech to the National Press Club in Washington.</p>

        <p>Echoing church teachings in the face of heightened national attention to the death penalty, the Roman Catholic archbishop of Los Angeles has urged Gov. Gray Davis of California to impose a moratorium on executions in the state and to appoint a bipartisan commission to conduct a ''comprehensive and objective study'' of a capital punishment system that he called ''fatally flawed.''</p>
        <p>''I believe that an objective study will provide substantial factual data to support moral and ethical questions raised by the Catholic bishops of California and the United States regarding the death penalty,'' the archbishop, Cardinal Roger Mahony, wrote in a letter to Mr. Davis that was made public on Thursday, when Cardinal Mahony elaborated on his comments in a speech to the National Press Club in Washington.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis, who is Catholic, has been an outspoken supporter of the death penalty. He has drawn increasingly vocal criticism from fellow Democrats for his tough stance on criminal justice in general, including his refusal of any recommendation the state parole board has made in favor of early prisoner release.</p>
        <p>Noting the recent decision of Gov. George Ryan of Illinois to impose a moratorium there after 13 men sentenced to death were exonerated by new evidence, and the New Hampshire Legislature's vote to abandon capital punishment, which was vetoed by its governor, Cardinal Mahony said in his letter, ''California has no less an obligation to conduct a thorough assessment of its system in order to identify the inequities, weaknesses and biases of the process used to try those charged with capital crimes and administer the death penalty.''</p>
        <p>California now has 565 inmates on death row, the most in the nation. In his speech, the cardinal noted that the long-term goal was ''not simply to make the death penalty free from bias, inequity or human error,'' but instead to open a ''public dialogue that ultimately brings a permanent end to state executions.''</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for Mr. Davis in Sacramento, Hilary McLean, said the governor ''will continue to enforce California's death penalty law as long as it's on the books.''</p>
