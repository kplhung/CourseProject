        <p>Two Nassau County jail guards who fatally beat an unarmed inmate were sentenced today to 11 years in federal prison, and a jail supervisor who tried to cover up for them received nearly 6 years.</p>
        <p>The guards, Patrick Regnier and Edward Velazquez, pleaded guilty in January to federal civil rights charges stemming from the fatal beating of Thomas Pizzuto, 38, who was serving a 90-day sentence in the Nassau County jail for a traffic infraction and was being treated for heroin addiction. The guards admitted to beating Mr. Pizzuto in his cell on Jan. 8, 1999, saying that they wanted to quiet his screams for methadone.</p>
        <p>Five days after the assault, Mr. Pizzuto died of a ruptured spleen. His death focused widespread attention on the Nassau County jail, prompting a criminal investigation, governmental hearings, a change in management and a continuing federal investigation into whether a pattern of abuse and misconduct exists at the jail.</p>
        <p>In sentencing the guards today in Federal District Court in Uniondale, Judge Jacob Mishler had to consider the severity of their actions: was the fatal beating they administered the equivalent of murder, manslaughter or involuntary manslaughter?</p>
        <p>Prosecutors argued that the beating was comparable to second-degree murder, punishable by 20- or 30-year prison terms under federal sentencing guidelines. Defense lawyers argued that the guards were responsible for nothing more than involuntary manslaughter, which could have led to sentences as short as three and a half years.</p>
        <p>Judge Mishler found a middle ground, ruling that the beating was comparable to voluntary manslaughter. ''At the time of the attack, Pizzuto was an inmate, unable to flee from his attackers and possessed of the knowledge that as loud as he screamed, no inmate or correction officer would come to his assistance,'' the judge wrote in his sentencing memorandum.</p>
        <p>After both guards made brief apologies and Mr. Pizzuto's mother, Carol, spoke of the pain of losing a son, Judge Mishler sentenced Mr. Regnier and Mr. Velazquez, 33, to 11 years and 3 months on the other side of the bars.</p>
        <p>Both sides said afterward that they were unsatisfied by the sentences. ''I expected more,'' the victim's mother said. ''I expected them to get what they deserved -- they killed my son.''</p>
        <p>But Dennis M. Lemke, a lawyer for Mr. Velazquez, said that the sentences were too long. ''We're not at all satisfied,'' he said. ''We'll file an appeal.''</p>
        <p>A supervisor for the guards, Cpl. Joseph Bergen, had gone to trial and been found guilty of trying to cover up for Mr. Regnier and Mr. Velazquez by writing a report claiming that Mr. Pizzuto was injured by falling in the shower.</p>
        <p>Judge Mishler sentenced Corporal Bergen to 5 years and 10 months in prison for his role as an accessory after the fact. According to testimony that was presented at his trial, Corporal Bergen told a fellow supervisor: ''You want me to write a report to help cover this up? I can write something for you guys.'' He then wrote the shower report.</p>
        <p>Jason Brown, the assistant United States attorney who prosecuted the case, said: ''We are hopeful that today's proceedings allow the Pizzuto family some comfort and that the judge's sentences send a strong message that inmate abuses of this sort will not be tolerated.''</p>
        <p>For nearly a year after the attack, Mr. Velazquez and Mr. Regnier proclaimed their innocence. Then, in January, a third guard who was charged in the attack, Ivano Bavaro, admitted to serving as a lookout. He accepted a plea bargain and agreed to testify against his colleagues. He is to be sentenced in June.</p>
        <p>Their defense unraveling, the two</p>
        <p>pleaded guilty, admitting that they had planned to beat Mr. Pizzuto even before they got to his cell. Mr. Velazquez said he went to the cell ''to quiet him down and use unreasonable force if necessary.'' Mr. Regnier said that he went there ''to do what I had to do to make him be quiet.''</p>
        <p>Peter J. Neufeld, a lawyer representing the Pizzuto family in the civil suit they have filed against the county, praised the federal government for its aggressive prosecution of the case. And he said that he was heartened by the stiff sentence Corporal Bergen received.</p>
        <p>''That's going to send out a real clarion call for everyone who works in these institutions that it no longer pays to be a good guard covering up for the bad guards,'' Mr. Neufeld said.</p>
