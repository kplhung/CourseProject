        <p>As any gourmand around here will tell you, there are but two types of butter in Russia. There is ordinary, bland butter, bought by ordinary, bland people and consumed on ordinary, bland occasions. And there is Vologda butter.</p>
        <p>Vologodskoye maslo: the name fairly trips off the tongue -- the Russian tongue, anyway. This is butter so cultured that it was originally called Parisian butter (about which more later), even though it is made in the Vologda Region, a vaguely Massachusetts-shaped, almost New York-sized area about 250 miles northeast of Moscow.</p>
        <p>This is creamy, melt-in-your-mouth butter. This is infarction-inducing butter, no less than 82.5 percent pure butterfat, by order of the Russian Federation.</p>
        <p>This is expensive butter. This is also profitable butter.</p>
        <p>This is why some scruple-deprived people are making counterfeit Vologda butter and pawning it off on hapless Russians as the Real Thing.</p>
        <p>And this is why Vladimir V. Mizgirev is angry.</p>
        <p>To be honest, Vladimir V. Mizgirev appears more hurt than angry. Mr. Mizgirev, a thin, slightly balding, pleasant-but-serious man, is general director of the Vologda Dairy Factory. In all of the Vologda Region, there are but three dairies that make Vologda butter, and Mr. Mizgirev's is the biggest by far.</p>
        <p>Everyone knows Mr. Mizgirev's butter. It is sold not only in the usual squat, foil-wrapped rectangles, but in bigger imitation-wood barrels that are instantly recognizable in better stores. He displays both packages -- empty, of course -- on a shelf in his office, along with other Vologda Dairy Factory products like chocolate butter and cheese. But Vologda butter is the company flagship.</p>
        <p>''Last year we sold 110 tons,'' he said. ''Our product is sold in Archangel -- 17 per cent there. Moscow Region, 15 per cent. Yaroslavl Region, 14 or 15 per cent. And so on.''</p>
        <p>The three makers of Vologda butter do not know how much of their market the counterfeit butter hawkers have stolen, but Mr. Mizgirev says it is considerable.</p>
        <p>''If you take Russia as a whole,'' he said, ''the producers of Vologda butter have lost millions of rubles.</p>
        <p>''You know, there are criminals behind this,'' he added darkly. But that is getting ahead of the story.</p>
        <p>Why is Vologda butter ''so good that unscrupulous people counterfeit it,'' a phrase that is not the company's advertising slogan, but could be? The answer is not simple.</p>
        <p>Tradition is one reason. The first creameries appeared here in 1835, and Vologda boasts the first cream separator in all Russia. Butter making has been an industry in this region since 1881, begun in the aptly named village of Molochnoye, or Milky. But the tale really begins with Nikolai V. Vereshchagin (b. 1839), founder of the Milk Academy of Vologda, operator of the nation's first, and presumably the only, butter-making school, noted turn-of-the-last-century expert on dairy innovation.</p>
        <p>It was Mr. Vereshchagin who noticed that ordinary butter sometimes seemed sour, and set about to fix that. Experimenting, he tried separating sweet cream from milk twice during butter-making, rather than once as was the usual practice.</p>
        <p>The result was a king among butters. It was fattier than the 70-percent-fat butter produced by one round of separation, and creamier as well. It had no odor, a delicious walnutty taste and utterly no aftertaste, thanks to its remarkable 16 to 18 Turner degrees of acidity.</p>
        <p>This, then, was real Vologda butter.</p>
        <p>At the time, actually, it was real Parisian butter, winner of the gold medal at the turn-of-the-last-century Paris Exhibition.</p>
        <p>Remote Vologda became the buttered toast of Europe, its superior recipe demanded by better classes of people across the Continent.</p>
        <p>In 1916 entrepreneurs set up the Vologda Dairy Factory to make Parisian butter. That was exceptionally bad timing: in 1917 Russia turned Communist and seized all private property. Later the Soviet authorities banned exporting of Parisian butter. In 1939 they changed its decadent Western name to Vologda butter. And Europeans forgot all about it.</p>
        <p>There it languished, a butter without honor in its own country, until Communism fell in 1991 and state-owned enterprises -- among them the Vologda Dairy Factory -- began to be turned over to private owners.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mizgirev, a two-decade veteran of the dairy industry, was one of them. He vowed to resurrect the glory days of Vologda butter. He turned the Vologda Dairy Factory into a spic-and-span milk palace. He made workers and visitors don clean uniforms before entering production areas, lest they bring dirt or germs from the outside. And soon his strategy began to work.</p>
        <p>In 1998 the Vologda Dairy Factory and its butter captured the gold medal at the Moscow Agricultural-Industrial Exhibition. A competing spread paid tribute to Vologda butter's cachet, adopting the catchy, snob-appeal slogan ''Rama margarine smells like Vologda butter.''</p>
        <p>''The governor said we should thank them for advertising our product,'' Mr. Mizgirev said.</p>
        <p>But such bliss was not to last. Behind the scenes, forces already were at work, purloining Vologda butter's customers and undermining its hard-won reputation.</p>
        <p>Mr. Mizgirev cannot remember when he first heard the bad news, but the somber details are etched in his memory. In the Vologda Region, old government-surplus butter began turning up on store shelves with the label ''Vologda Butter.'' Buyers told him some stores were carrying so-called Vologda butter that was actually margarine.</p>
        <p>Consumers complained that wrappers of the Vologda butter they had bought bore a spine-chilling notice in eye-straining type: ''Made in Finland.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Mizgirev complained bitterly to the authorities, but to no avail. The Vologda Dairy Factory adopted a symbol for all of its packages, an oval portrait of a fetching young milkmaid, as a signal of authenticity. It paid a major Moscow newspaper to publish an article about the merits of genuine Vologda butter as opposed to cheap imitations.</p>
        <p>Together the three Vologda butter makers tried legal maneuvers, eventually securing a trademark for the name ''Vologodskoye maslo.'' But the butter counterfeiters were a wily bunch: they eschewed ''Vologodskoye maslo,'' in which the region's name is an adjective, in favor of ''Vologda maslo,'' in which region's name is a noun.</p>
        <p>''They told us that because it wasn't the exact name, there was nothing we could do,'' Mr. Mizgirev said.</p>
        <p>But even at a latitude that endures 19 hours of daylight in the summer and 5 in the winter, it is always darkest before the dawn. And in the blackest hours of Vologda's bitter battle for better butter, the forces of light reached deep and found new strength.</p>
        <p>Rising to defend its own, the Vologda Chamber of Trade and Commerce has mounted a lobbying campaign to persuade Moscow to restrict production of Vologda butter to the Vologda Region, much as bourbon production is confined to Kentucky and Champagne making to a specific region of France.</p>
        <p>''As of now it hasn't been regulated,'' Mr. Mizgirev said, ''but we think it will come to that.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps more important, the butter makers themselves have struck a blow at last against their tormentors.</p>
        <p>One of the region's three butter manufacturers, the Experimental Firm, persuaded the Chamber long ago to file a complaint about butter counterfeiters with the federal anti-monopoly commission. The case wound through Russia's labyrinthine bureaucracy for three years.</p>
        <p>But on May 16 the regulatory commission issued a verdict: a Moscow company named Havana-M had improperly used the Vologda butter trademark, and was ordered to stop.</p>
        <p>A small victory, Mr. Mizgirev allowed this week, but a significant one.</p>
        <p>For if butter justice has prevailed in Vologda, can justice in all Russia be far behind?</p>
        <p>''The country is moving toward discipline and order,'' he said. ''The anarchy we had, where anyone could do anything, is passing. Not for nothing do I say that things are changing for the better.''</p>
