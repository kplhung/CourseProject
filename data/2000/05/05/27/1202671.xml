        <p>Sometime before the conventional strobes and smoke and amplified din -- as appealing as a car alarm -- herald the beginning of this afternoon's amusements in Madison Square Garden, Regis Van Gundy will sit down with a very tall person and ask him, eventually, if this is indeed his final answer.</p>
        <p>The reply will simply be yes or no.</p>
        <p>The question, of course, will be whether Patrick Ewing, his starting center, can play against the Pacers, as the Knicks return home, feeling as wan as if they'd found a caterpillar in their salad. They are down, two games to none, in the Eastern Conference finals.</p>
        <p>''It will be his call whether he starts or not,'' Van Gundy said. ''It'll be my call as to how much he plays.''</p>
        <p>And so Jeff Van Gundy, as he switches hats from quiz master to basketball coach, will learn in just what shape is the large right foot of Ewing, who sprained it during Thursday night's game in Indianapolis and is suffering from acute tendinitis.</p>
        <p>If the answer is Yes, that he can play, then that gives the Knicks just one more arrow -- and a significant one -- in their quiver. If it's No -- or even a Yes but one that turns out to be spurious -- then there must be another mind-set.</p>
        <p>''I told Patrick,'' Van Gundy said yesterday, ''that he should play only if he feels he can be effective.'' In other words, half a hero is no hero. ''I told our guys that we can't focus on Patrick being there. I mean, Indiana is coming in for the kill. They're not planning to give a game away. We have to be at our best.''</p>
        <p>If Ewing is a no-show, or a diminished-show, how will that affect the Knicks?</p>
        <p>It's not the first time that they had to go into a skirmish without Ewing. Last year he also was injured in Game 2 of the conference finals, in Indianapolis, and the Knicks went on to beat the Pacers in the series.</p>
        <p>When Ewing went out Thursday six minutes into the game, the Knicks played superbly until partway through the last quarter, when they played defense as if they were vactioning in Aruba. And, despite not having Ewing for the last 41 minutes of the game, they were tied with Indiana with just seconds to go.</p>
        <p>It is also no secret that the team is faster without Ewing, with Marcus Camby and even Chris Dudley running in transition.</p>
        <p>It is also the opinion here that Ewing is playing some of the best basketball of his life. Sure, at 37 years old, with banged-up back, wrist, knees and now foot, he has had suppler days, days in which his body didn't feel as if it were being held together by clothespins. But he is playing team defense, boxing out for rebounds and taking better percentage shots than usual. The last halves of the last two games in Miami -- the last shots of those last games, in particular, the stuffed rebound and the base-line drive -- were classics, the Hamlet, Beethoven's 5th, the Bart Simpsons of game-enders.</p>
        <p>Of course, there are still vestiges, at least, of the old Patrick. He still goes for head fakes as if it were impolite not to. Last game, a gimpy Rik Smits lifts his head as if he has an itch, and Ewing does his best Captain Marvel shtick and flies past him in a vain attempt to block the shot that wasn't shot. And Smits then pops in 2 points. And Ewing, after all these years, still hasn't made a pretty pass, or it escaped me.</p>
        <p>''When Patrick was out before,'' said Latrell Sprewell, the Knick small forward who has a bruised left thigh, ''other guys like Duds and Marcus and Kurt Thomas got the opportunity to play, and stepped up. They knew we needed them, and they came through. We stayed together as a team.''</p>
        <p>In practice yesterday, they went through drills without Ewing, who was nursing his foot.</p>
        <p>''It's feeling better today than it did yesterday,'' he said. ''Yesterday I could hardly walk.''</p>
        <p>Last year, of course, he was injured and watched the last four games of the Pacer series and the finals against San Antonio in dress clothes on the bench.</p>
        <p>''What's important,'' said Chris Childs, the Knick point guard who himself has a painful knee, ''is that whoever steps on the court gives a 110 percent. If Patrick is out there and helping us, that's a bonus.''</p>
        <p>In the end, the worth of Ewing would be made clear by who is rooting for him not to play. It's the Pacers.</p>
