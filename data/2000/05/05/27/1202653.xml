        <p>Gov. George Pataki is out of step with both the public and state lawmakers in vetoing an important bill that would require all cigarettes sold in New York to meet new fire safety standards by 2002. Lighted cigarettes dropped on beds and couches are the leading cause of fire-related deaths in the state, killing nearly 50 people a year. This deadly hazard can be significantly reduced if cigarettes are designed to be self-extinguishing after a smoker stops puffing on the cigarette.</p>
        <p>Both the State Assembly and Senate unanimously passed the bill, which was supported by medical groups, firefighters' associations, consumer advocates and anti-smoking groups. The only opponents were tobacco companies that argued against state regulation of their products.

Tobacco companies have the technology to meet the new standards. A few brands may meet them already.</p>

        <p>Gov. George Pataki is out of step with both the public and state lawmakers in vetoing an important bill that would require all cigarettes sold in New York to meet new fire safety standards by 2002. Lighted cigarettes dropped on beds and couches are the leading cause of fire-related deaths in the state, killing nearly 50 people a year. This deadly hazard can be significantly reduced if cigarettes are designed to be self-extinguishing after a smoker stops puffing on the cigarette.</p>
        <p>Both the State Assembly and Senate unanimously passed the bill, which was supported by medical groups, firefighters' associations, consumer advocates and anti-smoking groups. The only opponents were tobacco companies that argued against state regulation of their products. The bill would have directed the state Office of Fire Prevention and Control to create fire safety standards if a federal standard was not enacted by 2001. Tobacco companies have the technology to meet the new standards. A few brands may meet them already.</p>
        <p>Nevertheless, at the last minute Governor Pataki surprised the Legislature by vetoing the bill on the grounds that it did not deal with the potential bootlegging problem. He argues that smokers may not like fire-safe cigarettes, and may increase demand for illegally trafficked cigarettes that do not meet fire safety standards. He wants the Legislature to approve a separate bill that would increase penalties on cigarette bootleggers and curb illegal Internet sales of cigarettes to minors.</p>
        <p>Those ideas deserve support, but they need not prevent enactment of legislation that requires the industry to comply with new fire-safe standards two years from now. The governor approved a 55-cent-per-pack increase in the state cigarette tax without insisting on passage of anti-bootlegging measures. There is no need now to link fire-safe cigarettes with anti-bootlegging measures, which should be debated on their own.</p>
