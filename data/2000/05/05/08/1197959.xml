        <p>There was good reason to predict a Triple Crown sweep for Fusaichi Pegasus after his seemingly effortless performance in the Kentucky Derby on Saturday. But his trainer, Neil Drysdale, will wait to see whether there may be a better reason for not running him at all in the second leg of racing's most coveted and grueling series.</p>
        <p>Ever the cautious and conservative horseman, Drysdale offered only that his $4 million superstar is a possible entry in the Preakness, the second leg of the Triple Crown, on May 20.</p>
        <p>After moving seven horses wide under the jockey Kent Desormeaux and rocketing down the stretch to finish tied for the sixth-fastest time in the 126-year history of the Derby, the strapping colt took only a short walk today.</p>
        <p>''He was fine this morning,'' said Drysdale, who capped a week that included his induction into the Hall of Fame by winning the Derby on his first attempt. ''Somebody dropped something and he bounced. So he was nice and bright this morning.</p>
        <p>''We have to see how he comes out of this race first before we go on to the next. As you well know, they're fragile animals and sometimes things look easy and sometimes something shows up in the wash, whatever it might be. So, literally, we'll just go one step at a time. We've got to just see how he is the next few days.''</p>
        <p>In nearby barns along Churchill Downs's backside, Fusaichi Pegasus' contemporaries -- most of them tired, a few bandaged -- were being prepared to leave. They had come here considered one of the deepest crop of 3-year-olds in years and carried the Triple Crown aspirations of their trainers and owners.</p>
        <p>Now, those have been run over by the $4 million colt with the obstinate and rambunctious personality, leaving many of them unsure what to do next.</p>
        <p>The runner-up, Aptitude, will bypass Baltimore and Pimlico Race Course to run in the Belmont Stakes on June 10 in New York. Aptitude's trainer, Bobby Frankel, certainly did not sound overwhelmed by the winner's performance and said it might have made a difference if his jockey, Alex Solis, had kept Aptitude on the rail instead of taking the colt wide at the half-mile point. While Solis and Aptitude swung four wide around the final turn, Desormeaux crept up the inside and saved ground.</p>
        <p>''Don't get me wrong, Alex rode a good race,'' Frankel said. ''But Desormeaux took the gamble, and that was the difference of maybe winning or losing. I'm not saying I would have beaten him, but maybe that was the difference. I take my hat off to him.''</p>
        <p>The third- and fourth-place finishers, Impeachment and More Than Ready, are doubtful for the Preakness, though the trainer Todd Pletcher will wait until the Tuesday before the race to make his decision. The brawny, late-running Impeachment has a better shot at winning the one-and-a-half-mile Belmont, said Pletcher, than excelling over the shorter course in Baltimore that favors speedsters with its tight turns.</p>
        <p>More Than Ready may fit that profile, but the small, hard-trying colt, who had the lead briefly in the stretch in the Derby, is coming off two taxing efforts. He finished second by a head three weeks ago in the Blue Grass; today his legs were wrapped with bandages to soothe a handful of minor cuts.</p>
        <p>''He tries too hard and probably needs the rest,'' Pletcher said of More Than Ready. ''I'm inclined to wait for the summer for him. He has nothing left to prove.''</p>
        <p>Pletcher saddled four horses in his Derby debut, and the other two -- Trippi (11th) and Graeme Hall (19th and last) -- are off the trail.</p>
        <p>Jenine Sahadi, after watching The Deputy finish the 14th, said both she and her horse were exhausted and would take a vacation from the limelight. ''I am going to give him a month to kick back,'' said Sahadi, who was trying to become the first female trainer to win the race.</p>
        <p>Only D. Wayne Lukas with High Yield and Bob Baffert with Captain Steve seemed intent on trying Fusaichi Pegasus again in the Preakness. High Yield finished a disappointing 15th.</p>
        <p>''I don't have an explanation,'' Lukas, a four-time Derby winner, said about High Yield. ''I wish I did, and I am seldom at a loss for words. I never felt better about a horse three weeks prior to the Derby since Winning Colors.''</p>
        <p>Lukas also finished 12th with Exchange Rate and 17th with Commendable.</p>
        <p>Captain Steve's owner, Mike Pegram, says his colt will make the trip to the Preakness after being bumped in the stretch by Wheelaway and finishing eighth. The fifth-place finisher, Wheelaway, lugged into Captain Steve in the stretch, but by then both horses were beaten.</p>
        <p>''I hope he stubs his toe,'' Pegram said of Fusaichi Pegasus. ''Maybe somebody will impede him before he takes off. He was real impressive. But the thing about this business is that you can't be afraid to get beat. If you're not willing to reload and fire again, then get out.''</p>
        <p>At least two new, speedy challengers will take a shot at Fusaichi Pegasus if he heads to Baltimore: Red Bullet and Snuck In.</p>
        <p>The Joe Orseno-trained Red Bullet finished second to Fusaichi Pegasus in the Wood Memorial. Snuck In was the runner-up in the Arkansas Derby and withdrew from the Derby late in the week after the trainer Steve Asmussen decided the horse was too fractious to relax in a big field. ''That Pegasus is a freak,'' said Scott Blasi, Asmussen's assistant. ''He's just super, but our horse is pretty fast, too.''</p>
        <p>New challengers or not, new surface or not, Drysdale says he will wait to see if his colt's health coincides with his owner's plan. Fusao Sekiguchi, a Japanese venture capitalist, says he wants to pursue the Triple Crown but will leave it up to his trainer.</p>
        <p>''This is a very talented horse, and he looks like he's got a very bright future in front of him,'' Drysdale said of a colt who has won 5 of 6 races. ''So we'll keep our fingers crossed and go from there.''</p>
