        <p>The Maintenance Man</p>
        <p>In his 14 years as a maintenance man at St. Patrick's Cathedral, Jose Checo has performed many chores. He has gone up to the triforium, the gallery forming the upper story to the aisle of the cathedral, lowering the lights that hang some 40 feet above the pews, changing a bulb and then hoisting the lights back into place. He has polished the brass candlesticks. He has tended the lilies and irises in the garden where Cardinal O'Connor used to stroll in the afternoon sun. He has helped Florence Durso, a church benefactor, make flower arrangements on Easter and Christmas. He even helped her once to ready a bedroom in the cardinal's residence for the pope. That day, he said, he had something to tell his wife when he reached his home in Inwood.</p>

        <p>The official farewell to Cardinal John O'Connor culminates this afternoon in his funeral Mass, an intricately choreographed service that reflects the work of hundreds of people, many of them volunteers, most of them little noticed.</p>
        <p>The Maintenance Man</p>
        <p>In his 14 years as a maintenance man at St. Patrick's Cathedral, Jose Checo has performed many chores. He has gone up to the triforium, the gallery forming the upper story to the aisle of the cathedral, lowering the lights that hang some 40 feet above the pews, changing a bulb and then hoisting the lights back into place. He has polished the brass candlesticks. He has tended the lilies and irises in the garden where Cardinal O'Connor used to stroll in the afternoon sun. He has helped Florence Durso, a church benefactor, make flower arrangements on Easter and Christmas. He even helped her once to ready a bedroom in the cardinal's residence for the pope. That day, he said, he had something to tell his wife when he reached his home in Inwood.</p>
        <p>Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Checo had another task worth recounting: cleaning the open vault in the bank of tombs that will be the cardinal's final resting place.</p>
        <p>French kings and queens were once buried naked to symbolize their humility before God; the crypt at St. Patrick's, with its grid of simple inscriptions engraved in white marble, is similarly bare. By and large, the crypt is reserved for archbishops of New York, but Cardinal O'Connor will be buried next to an exception, John J. Maguire, a longtime aide to Cardinal Francis Spellman, and very near another, Pierre Toussaint, whom Cardinal O'Connor had reburied there as part of an effort to have the Mr. Toussaint, a former Haitian slave, canonized.</p>
        <p>After Mr. Checo finished cleaning and before a red velvet curtain was hung across the opening, he coated the inside of the vault with Vaseline, to ease the task of sliding in the coffin. Did the job seem strange?  ''No,'' he said. ''It's O.K.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Checo, a Roman Catholic, came to St. Patrick's by way of his brother, Raymond, who has worked at the cathedral since 1974. Mr. Checo came to the United States from the Dominican Republic three years later, and his job at the cathedral has enabled his wife to stay at home and raise their three daughters, Yarennis, Lisbeth and Jasmin. He remembered the boss of all bosses warmly. ''Every time he see me, he say in my language, hello, how are you,'' he said of Cardinal O'Connor. ''I think three or four times he went to my country.''</p>
