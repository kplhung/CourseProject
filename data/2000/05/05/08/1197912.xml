        <p>Female athletes, coaches, administrators, educators and entrepreneurs gathered here this weekend to celebrate their accomplishments and to prepare for the challenges ahead.</p>
        <p>In assessing the state of women in sports, those attending the 14th annual conference of the Women's Sports Foundation agreed that there were more opportunities for women since Title IX of the 1972 Educational Amendments banned sex discrimination in federally funded school programs. Now, in a stance that reflects the influence of the foundation and its constituency, the group wants to focus less on getting in and more on moving up.</p>
        <p>''Initially the primary function was opening doors of opportunity,'' said Donna Lopiano, the executive director of the foundation. ''Now, it's exploiting the participation of women in sports in an economic sense, gaining access to assets, program expansion and addressing the continuing problem of girls being discouraged from sports.''</p>
        <p>That sentiment was echoed in the theme of the conference: Brave New World of Women's Sports. For the 350 who registered for the three-day event at the Long Island Marriott, it was a chance to exchange information and ideas, network and develop strategy to fulfill the potential that women have in athletics.</p>
        <p>It provided a setting for the kind of informal debate many women had not engaged in since their college days, on topics as disparate as the feasibility of a 24-hour women's sports channel and the notion that news media images have increasingly portrayed female athletes as sex objects.</p>
        <p>During a panel discussion on women of color in sport, Krista Ford, the only African-American woman on the United States bobsledding team, talked about the trials and tribulations that come with being ''a first and only.''</p>
        <p>''There's no diversity in winter sports,'' said Ford, who also competes in bodybuilding. ''In bobsledding, there are no women on member boards. It's all good old boys.''</p>
        <p>Ford said she had grown weary from the constant battles, but vowed to continue the fight ''so other kids won't have to go through the hell we've had to endure as pioneers.''</p>
        <p>Established in 1974 by Billie Jean King, the foundation has emerged as a leader and advocate for women's sports. From May 1974 to May 1999, the foundation awarded more than $5 million in grants and scholarships to girls' sports programs, elite athletes in training and other leaders in women's sports. It annually responds to more than 100,000 requests for information on issues ranging from pregnancy and exercise to coed sports, and assists more than 700 students, parents and coaches a year on gender equity issues.</p>
        <p>To ensure its place in the future, the foundation has begun to change the way it reaches its audience. Last year it created a Web site, www.womenssportsfoundation.org.</p>
        <p>''Women's sports has been somewhat prevented from educating the next generation,'' Lopiano said, noting that because men are still largely in decision-making roles in athletics, women do not have equal access to young athletes. ''We had to find a way to leap over the more traditional communication systems of getting to kids through teachers in the schools and go directly to the teens by using teen media vehicles: television and the Web. The Web is the most cost effective.''</p>
        <p>Another measure of the foundation's clout was found in the mix of corporate sponsorships for this year's convention. Although there were female-oriented sponsors like Tampax and Sports Illustrated for Women, big donors also came from the finance, apparel and telecommunications industries. Among them: Merrill Lynch, Mervyn's of California and America Online.</p>
        <p>Karin Lofstrom traveled here from Ottawa, where she runs an on-line company for women's sports products.</p>
        <p>''We don't have an organization like the Women's Sports Foundation in Canada,'' she said. ''It's so exciting to be here with these women, who are helping to change the role women play in sports not only in America but throughout the world.''</p>
