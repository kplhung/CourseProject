        <p>The Mets are so uncertain how to deal with their current slump, left fielder Rickey Henderson said today, in the glare of the team's ninth loss in 12 games, that ''they're flipping a coin and hoping to find an answer.''</p>
        <p>Marlins right-hander Ryan Dempster had held the Mets to one hit in a 3-0 victory at Pro Player Stadium. Dempster, 23, who gave up only a two-out double by Mike Piazza in the sixth, had eight strikeouts and allowed four walks during his masterly complete game.</p>
        <p>After the loss, Henderson, replaced in today's lineup by Jon Nunnally, talked like a man who had just lost the coin flip as he sat steaming on a locker-room stool.</p>
        <p>''You have to believe in your players,'' Henderson said after the Mets dropped to 17-16. ''Once you don't believe in them, it's tough for us to go out there and play to win. We're trying to do so many things. How about getting back to the basics? How about pulling for one another to start?''</p>
        <p>Is he saying the Mets have some conflict in their clubhouse?</p>
        <p>''I've been on a lot of clubs, and I've been on clubs that win,'' he said. ''If it ain't a family, it's tough to win.''</p>
        <p>Moreover, the 41-year-old intimated, the Mets' brain trust does not appear to know what to do next.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of I-don't-knows, a lot of switching, a lot of everything,'' Henderson said. ''When you're doing all that, it's tough to win.''</p>
        <p>Henderson, who is hitting .205 while having played in 26 of the Mets' 33 games, said he needed to play more regularly to develop a rhythm.</p>
        <p>''I don't have to play every day, but spot playing is tough for anybody, not just Rickey,'' he said. ''I thought I was getting close to developing a rhythm -- but whoever gets out there, let somebody get in a rhythm. You need a day off, you ask for it. But the way I see it, if I played two days and needed a rest, I'd hang it up.''</p>
        <p>Piazza said the team's problems were nothing that could not be fixed, as the Mets did after a similar slump last season.</p>
        <p>''I don't detect any sign of finger-pointing,'' Piazza said. ''Most of the guys here have been through this before. It's a matter of riding the storm out and everybody staying focused to hustle as hard as they can.''</p>
        <p>Manager Bobby Valentine said his team looked tired today after playing 20 games in the past 20 days. The Mets have a day off Monday before going to Pittsburgh for a three-game series to complete a 13-game road trip.</p>
        <p>Today the Mets made Friday's four-run performance look like an explosion.</p>
        <p>Piazza broke up the no-hit bid by hitting the first pitch to him in the sixth, a slider, off the left-field wall. Cliff Floyd jumped for the line drive but missed it by several inches.</p>
        <p>The closest the Mets came to another hit was Derek Bell's liner to left in the eighth that Floyd caught with a timely lunge. Center fielder Preston Wilson saved Edgardo Alfonzo's try for a hit in the ninth with a diving catch.</p>
        <p>''He mixed a slider and changeup with his fastball and he had real good location,'' Alfonzo said. ''He deserved to win this game.''</p>
        <p>So did the Mets left-hander Glendon Rusch, under normal conditions. The Marlins touched him for a run in the first inning on three straight hits, but he worked out of trouble by getting Wilson to hit into a double play and prompting Mike Lowell to fly out. Rusch also allowed two hits in the second with one out, but retired the next two hitters.</p>
        <p>After that, Rusch (1-3) allowed only two base runners before he departed following the seventh inning. He retired the last seven batters he faced.</p>
        <p>''He doesn't let what's happening around him bother him at all,'' Valentine said. ''He makes good pitch after good pitch. He looks like a guy who can help us win a lot of games.''</p>
        <p>Despite such a well-pitched game, Rusch, who lowered his earned run average to 3.28 from 3.77, found himself deferring to Dempster's performance.</p>
        <p>''You've got to tip your hat to him,'' he said. ''We've got a great hitting team and he constantly stayed ahead in the count to them and made some great pitches. This was one of those days where he pretty much controlled the game by himself.''</p>
        <p>The last time the Mets were held to one hit came in 1994 by Andy Benes, then of San Diego.</p>
        <p>''We'll swing the bats better,'' Valentine said. ''And we'll pitch as well as we did today. That'll be the sign of a good team.''</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>BOBBY J. JONES, on a rehabilitation assignment with Class AAA Norfolk, pitched seven innings Sunday against Syracuse. He allowed nine hits and one run, striking out seven and throwing 97 pitches.</p>
