        <p>O'CONNOR-John Cardinal. The Board of Trustees of the Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York wishes to express profound sorrow and a deep sense of personal loss at the death of His Eminence John Cardinal O'Connor, Archbishop of New York and President of this charitable Federation. Throughout a lifetime characterized by extraordinary accomplishments and service, Cardinal O'Connor was foremost and preeminently a dedicated priest, imbued with love of God and love for all God's people. His leadership and many initiatives on behalf of the poor and disadvantaged of the Archdiocese have been a source of untold strength to this Board and a special blessing from Almighty God. With loving concern, our Good Shepherd recognized the demands of our changing times and encouraged tirelessly the development of many new programs for the benefit of children and youth, recent immigrants and refugees, the aged, the homeless, handicapped and the sick. As the Shepherd of God's people, his concerns were universal as he devoted himself with apostolic charity and zeal to the welfare and the best interest of all, not only in New York but throughout the United States, the Americas and the Third World. We thank Almighty God for sharing with us the faith and wisdom, the strength and the talents of his devoted servant, John Cardinal O'Connor. His memory and example will remain with us as a lasting legacy and inspiration. The Board of Trustees of The Catholic Charities of the Archdiocese of New York Most Rev. Patrick J. Sheraton Vice President Rev. Msgr. James J. Murray Secretary</p>
        <p>O'CONNOR-John Cardinal. The Jewish Community Relations Council of New York joins New York's Catholics in mourning the passing of His Eminence, John Cardinal O'Connor. A trailblazer, he opened new vistas in CatholicJewish relations: fighting for the freedom of Soviet Jewry, the diplomatic recognition of Israel and the condemnation of antisemitism. His compassion and unfaultering respect for the dignity of all human life led him to eschew hatred and bigotry of all types. In New York, he was the first archbishop to address Solidarity Sunday on behalf of Soviet Jewry and the first to attend a Salute to Israel Parade. As the keynote speaker at our 50th anniversary commemoration of Kristallnacht, he used his homily to movingly identify with Jewish Holocaust victims, while describing himself as a ''spiritual Semite''. He was a pastor to all New Yorkers with the ability to move those of us who knew him and those who merely knew of him. His is a monumental legacy. His memory will surely be a blessing. Gedale Horowitz, President Michael Miller, Executive V.P.</p>
        <p>O'CONNOR-John Cardinal. The Rabbis, Trustees and members of Congregation Emanu-El of The City of New York record with deep sorrow the passing of our cherished friend, His Eminence John Cardinal O'Connor. We join with sensitive humanity everywhere in giving thanks to God for the nobility of his life and the glory of his accomplishments. With matchless integrity and indomitable courage, he served his Church, simultaneously reaching out in heroic and creative ways to build genuine bridges of dialogue and understanding with Judaism and the Jewish people. No one in the American Catholic hierachy past or present, has been as caring and faithful a friend to the Jewish people as was His Eminence. He taught both Christians and Jews that theological differences, though profound and decisive, need not be barriers to love and understanding. We will cherish his memory as a blessing and the legacy he bequeaths is inscribed upon our hearts and written within our souls. Dr. Ronald B. Sobel, Senior Rabbi David E. Marrus, President Herbert C. Bernard, Secretary</p>
