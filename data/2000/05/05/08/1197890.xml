        <p>In a highly charged political atmosphere, it is the performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony this evening at the site of a Nazi camp in Mauthausen, Austria, that has caught the attention of the larger world. Yet everything about this weekend is unusual for the Vienna Philharmonic: even the workload, substantial as that typically is. The orchestra, which is drawn from forces of the Vienna State Opera, played the Beethoven on Friday evening and Saturday afternoon, with another performance to follow this morning.</p>
        <p>On Saturday evening most of the same players worked in the opera pit for Strauss's ''Frau Ohne Schatten,'' beginning a second round of Robert Carsen's new production, the first of the work here in 35 years, which played briefly in December. (Bizet's ''Carmen,'' thisevening, was assigned to another contingent of the opera orchestra.)</p>
        <p>Yet clearly nothing was held back in the Strauss opera, which was given its premiere here in 1919 and depends heavily on orchestral power and brilliance. Giuseppe Sinopoli conducted with good pacing, generally giving sufficient quarter to singers who needed relatively little.</p>
        <p>Deborah Voigt was especially fine as the mythical Empress, tortured by her lack of a shadow, not to say her inability to have children. As at the Metropolitan Opera, Ms. Voigt's clear, well-supported tone carried over the orchestra with apparent ease.</p>
        <p>Her effort was rivaled in strength and staying power, and at times in sheer tonal beauty, by Falk Struckmann as Barak, the Dyer. Ben Heppner, as the Emperor, appeared to be working harder to put across his finely honed sound. And Gabriele Schnaut, as the Dyer's Wife, though stentorian through two acts, seemed to weary in the third, shading flat and sounding a bit stressed. Still, all rose well to their big moments, as did Jane Henschel, the Nurse, to hers at the end of Act II.</p>
        <p>To two favorite sons of Vienna, Strauss and his librettist here, Hugo von Hofmannsthal, Mr. Carsen's concept added a third: Freud. The production made much not only of shadows but also of doors and mirror images, and the program book followed course with essays like ''Barak, Dyer and Psychotherapist.''</p>
        <p>The mythical realm went by the board -- or to stick to the conceit, was sublimated -- in Mr. Carsen's set, which, centering on the bedroom where the Empress spent so much time twisting and turning in agony, resembled nothing so much as a hotel room left shortly before, a block away on the city's famous Ring. The Dyer's lair, where couplings grew confused, was a recessed version of same, disheveled as if in dream, with a place up front -- again, back in my hotel room, it sometimes seemed -- to sit around a primitive fire.</p>
        <p>Yet even by the standards of the subconscious, some images proved ludicrous. Not soon will one forget the sight of Mr. Heppner, stuffed into a three-piece suit, standing on the Empress's bed, hovering precariously over Ms. Voigt while grasping for reasons not to shoot her with his pretended bow-and-arrow.</p>
        <p>To compensate for such oppressive drabness, Mr. Carsen supplied lighting design that was often brilliant, if occasionally self-consciously so. Aided by the costumes of Michael Levine, he managed to leave the Empress largely shadowless in a world of looming silhouettes. And in Strauss's actual dream scene, in Act II, he showed the Empress in bed as if from above, superimposing film projections on a scrim in front of her: an imaginative yet unobtrusive use of technology to startling effect.</p>
        <p>But the image that proved most haunting on this occasion was a hackneyed one: a sea of corpses surrounding the Empress as she was coming to accept responsibility for human misery. For a viewer on his way to Mauthausen, the scene, however stagey, was too literal for comfort.</p>
