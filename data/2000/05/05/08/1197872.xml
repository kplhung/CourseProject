        <p>Protecting the United States from missile attack sounds like a good idea, as Robert C. McFarlane emphasizes (Op-Ed, May 4). But so are finding a cure for cancer and providing Head Start for every American child who needs it.</p>
        <p>In fact, there are many good ideas in need of federal money, like improving our transportation system and cleaning our environment, most of which, according to recent polls, enjoy much more public support than does missile defense.</p>
        <p>With the $60 billion that the system is estimated to cost, we could renovate half of America's crumbling public schools, a good idea for which there is not a single dime in the federal budget. Given our options, it seems clear that missile defense is not America's priority.</p>
