        <p>For almost 45 minutes of another classic Knicks-Miami playoff scrum that the Heat would ultimately survive more than win, there was no definitive answer to the riddle in the middle. There were even a few moments when there was the temptation to say that Patrick Ewing was right, and that Alonzo Mourning was the best center in the Eastern Conference, next to him.</p>
        <p>Three minutes and 35 seconds from the finish of Game 1 today, Ewing lumbered off the bench and back onto the court with the Knicks leading by 81-79 and looking as if they were ready to stretch out on the sofa, make themselves at home in Miami's new digs.</p>

        <p>For almost 45 minutes of another classic Knicks-Miami playoff scrum that the Heat would ultimately survive more than win, there was no definitive answer to the riddle in the middle. There were even a few moments when there was the temptation to say that Patrick Ewing was right, and that Alonzo Mourning was the best center in the Eastern Conference, next to him.</p>
        <p>Three minutes and 35 seconds from the finish of Game 1 today, Ewing lumbered off the bench and back onto the court with the Knicks leading by 81-79 and looking as if they were ready to stretch out on the sofa, make themselves at home in Miami's new digs.</p>
        <p>Ewing had to this point played Georgetown Junior to a statistical draw, and, remarkably, on a day when his 37-year-old body was still recovering from recent back spasms, early on he looked as if he'd arrived at American Airlines Arena in need of assembly and a long extension cord.</p>
        <p>''It took me a while to get loose,'' Ewing said after the Heat's 87-83 victory. ''I was just trying to clog the middle and play some defense.''</p>
        <p>Now the Knicks, after taking a few figurative punches, had the Heat in its usual early-series quandary, fighting for a home-court advantage it had worked all season for but not knowing where its next basket was coming from. The very game Tim Hardaway was in no condition to create a shot for himself. After rising high his playoff past, Jamal Mashburn was beginning to fade from fourth-quarter view. Mourning himself had, minutes before, ruined one possession by holding the ball too long on the right side, then blown a dunk and missed two free throws that helped the Knicks to the lead.</p>
        <p>''I was forcing the issue, instead of being patient,'' Mourning said, nothing we hadn't heard before from him at this stage of the season, against this particular opponent.</p>
        <p>Mourning would rather be president of the Larry Johnson Fan Club than admit he's ever been affected by the presence of big brother Ewing. It's a news media fabrication, ''the one-on-one thing,'' he said, dismissively.</p>
        <p>Tell it to the judge, for in order to compensate for the injuries that have reduced Hardaway to offensive caretaker, the Heat can simply no longer afford Mourning battling Ewing to a draw. The last 3:35 today was an excellent start.</p>
        <p>First Mourning worked hard for position, drew Ewing's fourth foul and tied the score by converting two free throws. After the Knicks turned the ball over, Mourning isolated Ewing on the right side, a few feet from the baseline, and his body language shouting that he had no intention of settling for the jumper.</p>
        <p>He has done that too often because Mourning has never been a comfortable post player, never a center at all, in the classic back-to-the-basket mold. He doesn't have the true go-to shot, the reliable hook or turnaround jumper. His signature moves have been bullish drives, though less crude than they used to be, or the catch deep in the lane predicated again on brute strength.</p>
        <p>On the baseline, though on the left side, was where we had left Mourning and Ewing in their last close playoff encounter a year ago. Mourning failed to get around Ewing on a possession that could have iced the Knicks in the dying moments of the decisive Game 5. This time, Mourning got the step and the benefit of a call. Maybe this was the law of averages. Maybe it was Ewing's back, or another year off his reflexes.</p>
        <p>Mourning made the two free throws, but then Latrell Sprewell tied the score from the line with 55.6 seconds left. Once more, you got the idea that Miami was a single missed shot from coughing up Game 1. Pat Riley called it the ''need play,'' and as the ball swung in misdirection, Mourning happened to notice Ewing cheating in the lane as P. J. Brown rolled through.</p>
        <p>''I saw Patrick playing deeper,'' he said. ''I attacked, turned and sealed.''</p>
        <p>Dan Majerle made the precise entry pass, into the left post. All Mourning had to do was turn and drop the ball in the basket, off glass. Allan Houston would counter with a sloppy entry pass to Ewing that Brown slapped away. Jeff Van Gundy would let Miami run the clock down inside 10 seconds, a gamble he lost when Mourning faced Ewing up on the right side and nailed his jumper with 5.6 seconds left.</p>
        <p>Mourning had 26 points, the last 8 and the realization that Ewing and the Knicks would be back to try to undo all his effort Tuesday night for Game 2.</p>
        <p>''You keep hearing people say, 'Zo, you won the battle today,' '' he said. ''We got a long way to go.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks missed their last eight shots and still weren't put away until 5.6 seconds were left. The Heat, for its part, looked more like a team staggering to the end of Game 7 than one bursting from Game 1. Hardaway limped off to have his ailing foot retaped in the second quarter. Mashburn tripped over the foot of the official Mike Mathis and rolled his ankle. Even Mourning took a third-quarter blow to the temple from a scrambling Charlie Ward and dropped briefly to the floor like a rock.</p>
        <p>''The Heisman Trophy winner had some flashbacks,'' Mourning said. ''I didn't play much football.''</p>
        <p>Actually, he'd get a few arguments on that one. Mourning will never be poetry. He will never be pretty. He doesn't have to be against Ewing. He just needs to play like the man in his prime against a proud friend whose bones and muscles get crankier by the month. He needs to substantially win the middle for the Heat to win the war.</p>
