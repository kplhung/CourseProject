        <p>With a week of celebrity contestants, ABC had already found a new way to use ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire'' to hammer its competitors in a sweep month. But then last Thursday the network managed to pile on some additional torment for its main rival, NBC.</p>
        <p>ABC quietly let the Thursday edition of ''Millionaire'' run eight minutes long, just enough to blunt the start of NBC's strongest series, ''E.R.'' It blunted it enough for ABC to beat ''E.R.'' in its first half-hour, something no regularly scheduled ABC show had done in the seven-year run of the hit medical drama.</p>
        <p>At 10 p.m., ''E.R.'' flew into an air pocket as viewers remained hooked into the actor Ray Romano's efforts to answer questions on ''Millionaire.'' The game show had a huge 40.6 million viewers watching from 10 p.m. to 10:08 p.m. By the time the ABC news magazine ''20/20 Downtown'' finished out the half-hour, that number was down to 22.5 million. But ABC's average for the half-hour of 27.3 million easily beat the 24.6 million viewers tuned into ''E.R.''</p>
        <p>ABC executives said it had not been a formal plan to run ''Millionaire'' long to damage ''E.R.'' But because the show had committed to allowing every celebrity who participated in the week of games to have a shot on the air, it had less editing flexibility than normal. This was the case, ABC executives said, even though the celebrity shows were taped about a month in advance.</p>
        <p>About a week ago, ABC's program executives were informed the show would run long. They simply ordered the extra eight minutes to be cut out of the coming news program.</p>
        <p>Having seen what a little extra ''Millionaire'' can do to the previous prime-time ratings champ, will there be more occasions of run over? One senior ABC executive said, ''It has not gone without notice.''</p>
        <p>But another ABC program executive said, ''I really don't think it's in the best interests of 'Millionaire' to regularly tick off fans of 'E.R.' ''</p>
