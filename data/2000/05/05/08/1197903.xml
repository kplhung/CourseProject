        <p>Israel's cabinet voted to overhaul the country's tax system for the first time in a quarter century, backing a Finance Ministry proposal for lower income tax rates balanced by new levies on inheritances, foreign earnings and capital gains.</p>
        <p>The national labor federation staged a one-hour warning strike today to protest provisions in the proposed tax package, which will be submitted to the parliament next month. But in a rare show of cohesion, Prime Minister Ehud Barak's coalition cabinet endorsed the long-awaited tax plan with a 17-0 vote with two ministers abstaining.</p>
        <p>Overall tax payments for most Israelis would decline under the new rules, the government said.</p>
        <p>The biggest benefits, though, would accrue to those who earn the most. The threshold for the highest tax rate -- 50 percent -- would be raised from about $55,000 to slightly more than $100,000. The prime minister blocked an effort today by several of his ministers to raise the highest tax rate to 60 percent, contending that level of taxation would unfairly penalize ''people who are investing their best resources in Israel and aiding in its development and growth.''</p>
        <p>The most significant change in tax policy would be the introduction of a 25 percent capital gains tax on local stock sales. Currently, only earnings from stocks in foreign companies in international markets are taxed. The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange rose 4 percent today -- an indicator, analysts said, that investors were resigned to the capital gains tax even though it would eliminate one of the few advantages of listing shares locally.</p>
        <p>The proposed 25 percent capital gains tax would also apply to earnings on interest from securities and savings accounts.</p>
        <p>The package eliminates other loopholes, among them long-standing exemptions from taxes on rental income and the partial classification of many salaries as ''training funds'' rather than taxable earnings. All earnings from foreign sources would be taxed for the first time, ending special treatment for recent immigrants and international business consultants. Salaries earned by married women would no longer be taxed half a percentage point less than men's wages.</p>
        <p>Inheritance taxes would be reintroduced after a lapse of two decades -- but would apply only to estates of $500,000 or more. Corporate tax breaks for capital investments would be reduced or eliminated.</p>
        <p>Temporarily overshadowing the constant preoccupation here with peace talks and national security issues, the tax package galvanized national attention last week. Thousands of Israelis quickly tried to transfer funds abroad, deed gifts to children and open untaxed long-term savings accounts in hopes of avoiding estate taxes and capital gains assessments. All for naught, though. The cabinet said the new package, if passed, would apply retroactively to last Thursday, the day the reform proposal was first officially announced.</p>
        <p>The opposition Likud Party, sounding a populist note, vowed to join the labor movement in fighting the tax initiative. ''We object to the inheritance tax, to a tax on long-term savings, taxes on pension funds and training funds and canceling the tax credit for a working woman,'' said Ariel Sharon, the party's chairman.</p>
        <p>Yet the near-unanimous cabinet endorsement appears to ensure the passage of most of the complex package, which is widely considered the Barak government's most significant economic policy measure.</p>
        <p>Taken together, the proposed changes would have a negligible effect on the government's overall tax collections, with new taxes compensating for a projected decline in income tax receipts.</p>
        <p>David Klein, the governor of the central bank, suggested today that the reform initiative should seek to reduce the gross tax burden here, which is comparable to that in Northern European countries, which have average incomes nearly twice as high as in Israel. In addition to income and social security taxes, Israelis pay a 17 percent value-added sales tax on most goods and services.</p>
