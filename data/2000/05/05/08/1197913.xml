        <p>The Toronto Maple Leafs played their best game of their Eastern Conference semifinal series with the Devils on Saturday night. Because it was not good enough, the Leafs are facing elimination in New Jersey on Monday night.</p>
        <p>Not only did the Leafs turn in their best all-around effort of the series in Game 5, a 4-3 loss that gave the Devils a 3-2 lead in the four-of-seven-game series, but their top line, led by center Mats Sundin, also dictated play for the first time in the series.</p>
        <p>The end result at the Air Canada Center was a familiar one, however. The Sundin line was held without a point for the fourth time in five games and the Leafs played the last two periods without defenseman Aleksandr Karpovtsev (who was hit in the chest with a stick).</p>
        <p>''We probably played our best game,'' said Sundin, who combined with Steve Thomas and Jonas Hoglund for seven shots on goal. ''We created a lot of chances. And still we have nothing to show for it.''</p>
        <p>The only thing the line has to show for the series so far is one Hoglund goal, with assists from Sundin and Thomas, in Game 4. One goal. Two assists. That's it.</p>
        <p>Jeff Farkas, the 22-year-old rookie from Boston College whom the Leafs signed as a free agent on April 15, matched that goal total with his first as a professional on Saturday night. Farkas, who was inserted into the Toronto lineup for Game 4 to charge a moribund offense, has done everything Leafs Coach Pat Quinn could have wanted.</p>
        <p>''Absolutely,'' Quinn said. ''Here's a guy who was in no man's land. He certainly has not embarrassed himself at all.''</p>
        <p>While his classmates at Boston College have been taking final exams, and while his roommate and best friend, the Rangers draft choice Mike Mottau, plays defense for the United States at the world championships in St. Petersburg, Russia, Farkas has been taking his National Hockey League entrance exams. He has teamed with left wing Sergei Berezin and center Igor Korolev to give the Leafs a blazingly quick line.</p>
        <p>Farkas's line was the Leafs' most productive one on Saturday night. He and Berezin each scored a goal. But if the Sundin line does not produce soon, Farkas will soon be back at Boston College finishing the work on his degree. Farkas left school after Boston College lost to North Dakota in the National Collegiate Athletic Association finals this spring.</p>
        <p>Even though he has played just two professional games, Farkas is just one goal off the team lead for the series. Darcy Tucker has two this series to lead the Leafs, and he may have sparked a feud that may carry into Monday night's game.</p>
        <p>Tucker had not one but two run-ins with Devils goalie Martin Brodeur on Saturday, including one that sparked a postgame fracas. Tucker, who is not known for his restraint, promised there would be more to come in Game 6. The Devils responded by saying they would welcome all the power plays they can get. That brings up another sore spot for Toronto: the Maple Leafs are 0 for 18 on the power play in the series.</p>
        <p>The Devils had eight power plays in the last two games compared to three for Toronto, one reason the officiating crew was showered with debris after it left the ice on Saturday night.</p>
        <p>''People are asking about our power play,'' said Quinn, after the Leafs were 0 for 2 on Saturday and the Devils were 2 for 5. But the power play does not work, he explained, if you never get on it.</p>
