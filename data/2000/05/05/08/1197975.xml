        <p>Cardinal John O'Connor is to be honored today in a majestic and intricately planned Roman Catholic funeral Mass that, though rooted in ancient traditions that viewed death as a bleak event, will celebrate his anticipated ascension into heaven and eternal life with God.</p>
        <p>An estimated 3,500 people -- from President Clinton to city and state leaders to cardinals and archbishops in colorful vestments -- are to gather under the spires of St. Patrick's Cathedral at the 2 p.m. Mass for the cardinal, the eighth man to lead the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York.</p>
        <p>From the opening prayers to the singing of hymns to the taking of communion, the ceremony is at its core the same carefully structured Mass of Christian Burial held the world over for any Roman Catholic, said the Rev. Thomas Lynch, who teaches church history at St. Joseph Seminary in Yonkers. But the people packing the pews of the church -- and presumably millions more who will watch on television -- will see an elaborate, two-hour event filled with pageantry and spectacle honoring Cardinal O'Connor, who died Wednesday at 80.</p>
        <p>''We believe that to celebrate Holy Mass at important times, we are united in Christ, who himself died and also rose from the dead,'' said Msgr. Ferdinando D. Berardi, who coordinates ceremonies for the archdiocese and has helped to plan the funeral. ''What we are praying is that the person who has been baptized will now pass over from death to life through the blessings that he has received through his association with Christ.''</p>
        <p>With the cardinal's closed coffin resting in the center aisle near the altar, the light streaming through the church's stained glass, the ceremony will begin with a procession expected to take 45 minutes.</p>
        <p>Following a cross bearer, hundreds of priests, nuns, deacons, representatives of lay orders and leaders of other religions will file through the portals of St. Patrick's. Many of the celebrating priests will wear the archdiocesan chasuble, a sleeveless outer vestment, designed for Pope John Paul II's tour of the New York area in 1995.</p>
        <p>Archbishops, noticeable by the woolen palliums, white bands, around their necks, will follow. Those last in the procession will be among the highest-ranking officials in the Roman Catholic Church, two cardinals from the Vatican and 13 others from the United States and four other countries. They will wear the crimson skullcaps identifying them as cardinals, the white vestments symbolizing the resurrection and the miters that church princes wore for centuries.</p>
        <p>Among them will be Cardinal William Baum, the senior American cardinal at the Vatican, who will speak to the congregation. Cardinal Bernard Law, archbishop of Boston, will deliver the homily, and Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the Vatican's secretary of state and the pope's No. 2 man, will preside over the ceremony.</p>
        <p>Dr. Peter Awn, a former Jesuit priest and a professor of religion at Columbia University, said the rich, elaborate nature of a cardinal's funeral hark back to an ancient church in which cardinals were actually princes and popes were monarchs.</p>
        <p>''On occasions like this, religious institutions like the Roman Catholic Church fall back on the classical traditions,'' he said. ''So all of the rituals surrounding the funeral of a cardinal are very reminiscent of these ancient, older allusions.''</p>
        <p>The ancient Christian ceremonies were gloomy and foreboding. And through the centuries, Catholic funeral ceremonies -- with their medieval chants, candles surrounding coffins and apocalyptic hymns like ''Dies Irae'' (Day of Wrath) -- continued to emphasize concern about judgment day.</p>
        <p>Things started to change with the Second Vatican Council in 1965. The Catholic Church, in its drive to broaden participation, ceased to compel the use of Latin in Mass, did away with black garments and simplified its ceremonies. Other revisions came later, affecting the rites of burial. Today, church officials and experts on the liturgy say, the focus is on celebrating the deceased's new life.</p>
        <p>''The liturgy has been transformed since Vatican II,'' Dr. Awn said. ''Rather than seen as bleak, a fearful event, it is really a Mass celebrating resurrection.''</p>
        <p>For mourners, Monsignor Berardi said, the effect has been one of affirmation and faith, stressing the hope and renewal that come with the afterlife. ''We try to stress this positive reward -- yes, there's a death, but there's a renewed life,'' said the monsignor, who is also the archdiocese's director of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith.</p>
        <p>That emphasis starts from the very beginning of Mass, with the cardinal's wooden coffin covered with a white pall and blessed with holy water, reminiscent of the joy of baptism. A Gospel book is placed on the coffin, a sign that those who remain must carry on the Gospel of Christ to the world. A crucifix -- Monsignor Berardi said it would be the one that the cardinal prayed to in his bedroom -- will rest on the coffin.</p>
        <p>The concelebrants -- those who come in union to celebrate the Mass -- will enter the sanctuary area, Cardinal Sodano in the center and the other cardinals close by.</p>
        <p>After an opening prayer, Mother Agnes Donovan, the superior of the Sisters of Life, an order founded by the cardinal, will do the first reading from the Old Testament. The reading, from the Apocryphal Book of Wisdom, says that the ''souls of the just are in the hand of God, and no torment shall touch them.''</p>
        <p>The second reading, from the New Testament, is from the letter of Paul to the Colossians. Read by Therese Snyder of the Catholic Guild for the Blind, Paul explains that he has found ''my joy in the suffering I endure for you,'' and says that he became a minister through God's will. ''In my own flesh,'' the letter goes, ''I fill up what is lacking in the sufferings of Christ for the sake of his body, the church.''</p>
        <p>The third and last reading, from the Gospel of Mark, recounts the Passover Supper. In one of the most important biblical passages, Jesus tells his followers, ''Take this, this is my body.''</p>
        <p>Sister Ann Rehrauer, associate director of the Liturgical Secretariat for the United States Catholic Conference of Bishops in Washington, said the themes in the readings would carry a strong sense of hope.</p>
        <p>''The readings are going to reflect on our Christian life, and the meaning of our life in relation to our death and in relation to life after death,'' she said. ''So you will see in the Scripture readings a focus on the resurrection, a strong sense of hope and a strong expression of faith that life doesn't end, it changes and it changes for the better.''</p>
        <p>The homilist, Cardinal Law, will then speak in the one part of the Mass that is not scripted. But the homily is expected to be far different from a freewheeling eulogy one might hear in other Christian churches, with the emphasis on the deceased's accomplishments.</p>
        <p>While Cardinal O'Connor will certainly be lauded, the homilist's primary goal is not to praise him, Sister Rehrauer said. Rather, it is to give thanks to God.</p>
        <p>''Anything the cardinal was able to do, he did for the grace of God,'' said Sister Rehrauer, ''which is different from a eulogy, which says, 'Isn't this a terrific person.' ''</p>
        <p>After the Prayer of the Faithful, members of the cardinal's family will bring the gifts of bread and wine to the altar, which Catholics believe become the literal body and blood of Christ. Prayers are then offered.</p>
        <p>The steps that follow are among the most significant and emotional in Catholicism, starting with a recollection of Christ's words and deeds at the Last Supper. Catholics believe that by taking bread, giving thanks, breaking bread and giving it to the disciples, Christ gave of himself. The next day he was crucified. And by now accepting the body and blood of Christ, the believer is, in turn, accepting him and his teachings.</p>
        <p>''Christ becomes present in the bread and in the wine and when we receive that bread and wine, now made in the body and blood of Christ, we participate in the very life of Christ,'' Monsignor Berardi said.</p>
        <p>After communion, the last prayers are read over the body of the cardinal. The coffin is blessed with holy water, again recalling baptism. The choir will sing ''may the angels take you into a paradise.''</p>
        <p>The coffin will then be carried up the altar, around the rear and down a narrow stairwell to a crypt that holds the bodies of five cardinals, four archbishops, other church leaders and Pierre Toussaint, a 19th-century Haitian whose cause for sainthood was supported by Cardinal O'Connor. Accompanying the coffin, said Monsignor Berardi, will be the cardinal's family and a few clergy members.</p>
        <p>''This is where he presided for so many years as our shepherd, and now he is being brought back to the sanctuary to go to his final place of rest,'' said Monsignor Berardi.</p>
        <p>In the crypt, a final prayer is said, holy water is sprinkled and the choir will sing the traditional hymn to Mary, ''Salve Regina.'' It is a fitting ending, church officials said, for the cardinal had a lifelong devotion to Mary, the Mother of God.</p>
