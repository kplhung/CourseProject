        <p>Now it is Microsoft's turn to say what its future should be. On Wednesday, the company must submit its reply to the government's proposal to split the company in two and, at the prodding of a federal judge, offer its own suggested remedies in the antitrust case.</p>
        <p>Microsoft will not say precisely what its remedy recommendations will be. But they are expected to consist mainly of a reiteration of proposals Microsoft has made repeatedly during on-again, off-again settlement talks with the government over the last two years. The Microsoft concessions, according to people close to the talks, have covered opening up the company's pricing, contracts and the sharing of technical information with industry partners and rivals.</p>
        <p>The specific steps have included allowing personal computer makers greater freedom to modify Microsoft's Windows desktop screen, ensuring that rival software makers get equal access to technical information about the Windows operating system, and curbing the company's ability to enter into contracts with computer makers and Internet service providers that limit their ability to use and promote competing software.</p>
        <p>Another Microsoft proposal, according to people close to the talks, has been to offer standard prices, adjusted for the volume, to PC makers licensing the company's industry-standard Windows operating system -- addressing the allegation in the antitrust case that Microsoft has used Windows pricing as a way to reward friendly companies and punish companies that deal closely with Microsoft foes.</p>
        <p>Microsoft has little choice but to engage in what it regards as the unpalatable exercise of recommending sanctions against itself. At a scheduling hearing in early April, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson told the Microsoft legal team that on May 10 it had to give the court its answer to the government proposal including its counterproposals.</p>
        <p>The Microsoft proposal has to be based on Judge Jackson's findings of fact and legal ruling, which found the company to be a monopolist that repeatedly violated the nation's antitrust laws.</p>
        <p>Microsoft, to be sure, plans to appeal Judge Jackson's ruling and maintains, in the words of William H. Gates, the chairman, that the company ''has done absolutely nothing wrong.''</p>
        <p>But in the meantime, Microsoft will swallow hard and suggest some curbs on its behavior. ''As the court has requested,'' said Mark Murray, a company spokesman, ''Microsoft will outline steps that would be reasonable and appropriate recommendations to remedy specific violations found by the court, recognizing that Microsoft disagrees with the court's ruling and plans to appeal.''</p>
        <p>In the past, the Justice Department and the 19 states suing Microsoft had rejected the company's settlement offerings as too limited and too easy for Microsoft to sidestep. And their stance has not changed. ''This is nothing new,'' a government official said yesterday. ''The Microsoft proposals are backward-looking and filled with loopholes. They would be completely ineffective in stopping Microsoft in the future from using its monopoly power to squelch innovation.''</p>
        <p>Yet Microsoft, in its filing, will likely direct its strongest fire at simply attacking the government plan to break the company into two -- one with the Windows operating system business, and a second company with the Office productivity programs like the Word word processing and Excel spreadsheet software and other businesses like the MSN Internet service.</p>
        <p>The government plan, Microsoft says, is ''extreme and radical'' -- an unjustified and dangerous gamble with a company that has contributed greatly to America's high-technology economy.</p>
        <p>Still, this is not the first time the government has considered breaking up Microsoft. In an earlier Justice Department investigation, which led to a 1994 consent decree between Microsoft and the government, ''we absolutely looked at a breakup,'' said Robert E. Hall, a professor at Stanford University who was an economic consultant to the Justice Department at the time.</p>
        <p>''The arguments for a breakup are not ridiculous,'' he said. ''There are good arguments for it.''</p>
        <p>In the end, however, Mr. Hall decided not to recommend a breakup plan for two reasons. First, he said, the Justice Department then did not have the kind of evidence or the legal findings they now have. But second, Mr. Hall said, in 1994 he did not have enough confidence that the ''tangible benefits would more than make up for the efficiency losses to consumers from splitting up an integrated company.''</p>
        <p>In simple terms, the antitrust argument about economic ''efficiencies'' boils down to whether courts believe that the potential benefits of a breakup plan will outweigh the possible harm.</p>
        <p>That is the difficult judgment that Judge Jackson -- and higher courts on appeal -- will have to make, if Microsoft is to be broken up.</p>
        <p>Antitrust experts predict, that the danger to consumers of breaking up the company will be a leading argument to be heard from the Microsoft camp. ''I expect efficiencies to the major battleground'' in the remedy phase of the case, said Carl Shapiro, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, who filed a declaration in support of the government plan last month.</p>
        <p>There is nothing new about the antitrust debate over the economic outcome from breaking up a company. ''If the defendant raises serious doubts about efficiencies, judges tend to back away from a breakup,'' observed William Kovacic, a professor at the George Washington University law school.</p>
        <p>Indeed, that tradition dates back to 1916, when a federal court deciding not to break up the American Can Company, despite its control of can-making at the time, cited the potential loss to consumers. The court declared that it was ''frankly reluctant to destroy so finely adjusted an industrial machine as the record shows the defendant to be.''</p>
        <p>Already, Microsoft is warning that consumers will suffer if the company is split up. Mr. Gates has pointedly said that the government plan could not have been drafted by anyone who knows anything about the software industry.</p>
        <p>The government proposal, Microsoft insists, would ban all kinds of  cooperation within the combined company. Such teamwork, Microsoft says, has enabled programmers in the Windows division and programmers in the Office division to jointly develop many software features that make computers easier to use. .</p>
        <p>The government replies that its plan is not deeply regulatory at all. The breakup, a government official said, is a prudent way for the government to ''ensure that the monopoly Windows business has a powerful incentive to deal with everybody equally.''</p>
        <p>Microsoft's arguments, advocates for the government add, have a familiar ring. ''Before the breakup of AT&amp;T,'' Paul M. Romer, a Stanford University economist, wrote in a declaration supporting the government, ''engineers described the advantages of having a single firm that produced all the telephone handsets that connected to the telephone network. Since the breakup, consumers have benefited from the wider range of choice and more rapid innovation in the handsets that competition made possible.''</p>
        <p>Whether the lesson of the AT&amp;T breakup in 1984 applies to Microsoft is open to question. ''Breaking up AT&amp;T into long distance service and the regional Bell operating companies was an exercise with much clearer boundaries than splitting up Microsoft would be,'' said Mr. Hall.</p>
        <p>But, Mr. Hall added, ''It is really up to Microsoft to come forward and explain how the Windows and Office sides of the business work together in ways that help consumers and do not illegally disadvantage competitors. Microsoft has to let that process be subject to scrutiny.''</p>
        <p>For its part, Microsoft will be asking for more time -- months more -- to take depositions and present witnesses to try to show that the government's split-up plan is misguided.</p>
