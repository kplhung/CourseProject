        <p>AFTER visiting her mother, Grace Burney got into an elevator with her husband and children and realized that the man facing her looked familiar. He was dressed in a T-shirt and shorts, carried a bicycle helmet and was standing between an older couple -- his parents, she figured. Finally, her staring became obvious. The father smiled at her and pointed at his son. ''You recognize him?'' he asked. But Ms. Burney still could not place the face.</p>
        <p>''We went to high school together,'' the younger man joked. Not possible, she thought, too big an age difference. The man kept bantering. ''Where do you live?'' he asked. Ms. Burney told him, and asked where he lived. His reply did nothing to help her. She still could not place him. As they were leaving the elevator, he finally assuaged her curiosity. ''I'm your senator,'' he said.</p>

''I'm your senator,'' he said.</p>
        <p>It was Charles E. Schumer, who had bicycled from Brooklyn to Queens and had also been visiting his parents. They were seeing him off.</p>
        <p>Shelley Miller and Janet Capron were at the Quad Cinema in Manhattan. As the two remaining films were about to begin, the usher in charge announced the order of admission: '' 'Beautiful People,' line for 'Beautiful People' only.'' The crowd laughed and the usher lifted the velvet rope.</p>
        <p>The announcement that followed delighted the remaining moviegoers. ''Next -- 'Trash,' '' the usher declared.</p>
        <p>The two women bowed proudly before entering the appropriate theater.</p>
        <p>During a visit with his sister and her family, Ashton Spann offered a $10 bill to one of his grandnieces who was in her early teens. She was reluctant to accept it and protested, albeit somewhat mildly, ''Oh, you don't have to do that, Uncle Ashton.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Spann insisted. He put the bill in her hand. ''Now, now, that's what uncles are for,'' he said.</p>
        <p>She gave him a hug and whispered in his ear, ''Gee, Uncle Ashton, you certainly know your job description.''</p>
        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>Perhaps because I have written two books on Mrs. Roosevelt, a friend gave me a book called ''The Eleanor Roosevelt Girls'' by Bonnie Bluh, as a birthday gift. It made me eager to read Ms. Bluh's other works, and one weekend a friend and I went into a bookstore in Greenwich Village. The saleswoman said they had no other books by that author and that a search of Books in Print found nothing.</p>
        <p>''How odd,'' I said. ''Several other titles are listed in the author's new book as well as three plays. I'd love to meet Bonnie Bluh -- we both seem to love Mrs. Roosevelt.'' Then I asked if by chance, she knew Ms. Bluh. ''I'm afraid not,'' the saleswoman said.</p>
        <p>A tall young man nearby spoke up. ''I know Bonnie Bluh,'' he said.</p>
        <p>''Really?'' I exclaimed. ''That's great. Do you know her well?''</p>
        <p>''Well, yes, I guess so,'' he replied. ''I am her son.''</p>
        <p>We all broke out laughing. I handed him my card and said I would love to hear from his mother. A few weeks later, my phone rang. It was Bonnie Bluh and we arranged to meet.</p>

        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>Buttons! Buttons! Our lives are full of buttons. We push them from our first waking moment until day's end. Pushing buttons to start the day -- to illuminate the dark, start coffee, ignite a stove, use a hair dryer, curling iron, radio, CD player, washer, dryer, cross a street, use a computer, calculator, cell phone, telephone, elevator, snack machine.</p>
        <p>WHOOSH! Think of a life button-free. There would be no life at all, because I'm sure it's buttons that light up the sun and click on the moon and stars. Thoughts bring out dimples and smiles or tears and sobs from built-in buttons that are triggered by happiness or sorrow.</p>
        <p>And then at night we push a button to close out the world and activate the button of dreams. There are a million buttons in our lives. We live in a button box.</p>
        <p>ELEANOR NYSTROM</p>
        <p>The company they worked for was bought out, and during a farewell lunch Philip L. Rolston and his colleagues were recalling memorable moments in their years with the firm. They pinpointed one of the highlights as a speech to the staff given by their president, who had just been hired from France.</p>
        <p>''I understand you have heard many rumors in the vineyard,'' the president began. The staff was at a loss: how did vineyards get into the act? Sensing their bewilderment, the president turned to an aide. ''How does that expression go?'' he asked. The aide put him right -- a matter of one word. ''The grapevine,'' the aide said. ''The phrase should go, 'I understand you've heard many rumors on the grapevine.' ''</p>
        <p>I'LL TAKE MANHATTAN</p>
        <p>I dreamed about retiring</p>
        <p>and venturing out west;</p>
        <p>I'd trade the city's frantic pace</p>
        <p>for open space and rest.</p>
        <p>Eventually it dawned on me --</p>
        <p>to move would prove sheer folly,</p>
        <p>For life's not worth a whit without</p>
        <p>A shmeer on my bialy.</p>

        <p>HEADLINES</p>
        <p>I've developed a topsy-turvy frown!</p>
        <p>Why? Because every goshdarned clown</p>
        <p>who has a newsstand in our town</p>
        <p>places the headlines upside down!</p>

        <p>Dear Diary:</p>
        <p>My grandchildren visited me recently and as a  treat, I took them to F.A.O. Schwarz, the ultimate toy store. I told them they could wander through the store, play with the samples and then each of them could make a choice of one toy. We were followed into the store by another grandmother and her grandson. I realized she was more creative than I when I overheard her tell the boy that this store was like a museum -- you were allowed to touch but there was nothing to buy.</p>
