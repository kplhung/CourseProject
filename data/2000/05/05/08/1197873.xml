        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>As the professional storyteller who created and ran the workshop for Holocaust survivors at the Museum of Jewish Heritage, mentioned in a May 3 news article, I was surprised and dismayed that you missed the point of that event: to help survivors recall their joyous Jewish pasts, before World War II, and tell stories about those rich and fulfilling lives rather than once again recounting their memories of their brutal wartime experiences.</p>

        <p>As the professional storyteller who created and ran the workshop for Holocaust survivors at the Museum of Jewish Heritage, mentioned in a May 3 news article, I was surprised and dismayed that you missed the point of that event: to help survivors recall their joyous Jewish pasts, before World War II, and tell stories about those rich and fulfilling lives rather than once again recounting their memories of their brutal wartime experiences.</p>
        <p>As the child of a Holocaust survivor, I recognize only too well the importance of remembrance. But remembrance, stitched together solely of persecution and victimization, is a dangerous proposition. The survivors of the Holocaust knew what it was like to be Jewish proactively, and their exquisite stories of prewar Jewish life, which tumbled out so freely and vividly at the museum that day, are a compass for the next generation.</p>
