        <p>Tom Kelly became the 46th manager to win 1,000 games as the Minnesota Twins beat the visiting Detroit Tigers, 4-0, yesterday behind a five-hitter from Joe Mays (1-4).</p>
        <p>Kelly has managed the Twins since Sept. 12, 1986, the longest current tenure in the four major professional sports. He has won two World Series titles in Minnesota. Kelly, the sixth active manager with 1,000 victories, has also lost 1,092 games.</p>

        <p>Tom Kelly became the 46th manager to win 1,000 games as the Minnesota Twins beat the visiting Detroit Tigers, 4-0, yesterday behind a five-hitter from Joe Mays (1-4).</p>
        <p>Kelly has managed the Twins since Sept. 12, 1986, the longest current tenure in the four major professional sports. He has won two World Series titles in Minnesota. Kelly, the sixth active manager with 1,000 victories, has also lost 1,092 games.</p>
        <p>After the game, Kelly walked out of the dugout clutching the lineup card and shook hands with his players.</p>
        <p>Mark Johnson (0-1) took the loss in his second major league start.</p>
        <p>INDIANS 10, BLUE JAYS 8: Travis Fryman hit a run-scoring single off Eric Gunderson (0-1) in the 12th inning as visiting Cleveland overcame a six-run deficit.</p>
        <p>The Indians, who trailed 6-0, tied the game with two runs off Billy Koch in the ninth inning before winning it in the 12th. David Justice went 3 for 5 with five runs batted in for Cleveland.</p>
        <p>Paul Shuey (2-1) pitched two and one-third innings for the victory. Steve Karsay pitched the 12th for his sixth save.</p>
        <p>Jose Cruz Jr. hit his 13th homer and Raul Mondesi hit his seventh for Toronto.</p>
        <p>RED SOX 9, DEVIL RAYS 7: Troy O'Leary and Trot Nixon homered in the third inning to support Jeff Fassero and give Boston the victory over visiting Tampa Bay.</p>
        <p>Fassero (4-1) allowed three runs and nine hits in six innings in his longest start of the season. Fassero, who went 5-14 in 1999, has nearly matched his victory total from last year in just six starts.</p>
        <p>The Red Sox trailed by 3-1 in the third when Nixon blasted a two-run homer, his fifth, off Bryan Rekar (0-1) into the right-field bleachers to tie the score at 3-3. One out later, O'Leary also hit his fifth homer to put Boston up by 4-3.</p>
        <p>Carl Everett added a three-run homer in the fifth to give Boston an 8-3 lead.</p>
        <p>ROYALS 12, WHITE SOX 8: Carlos Beltran's three-run double keyed a five-run eighth inning as Kansas City completed a three-game sweep. Jermaine Dye hit his 13th home run as the Royals completed an 8-3 homestand.</p>
        <p>Johnny Damon's single marked the 10th straight game in which he's led off with a hit for Kansas City. It's the longest such streak since 1975 -- the Elias Sports Bureau was unable to research the obscure stat before then.</p>
        <p>Carlos Lee and Greg Norton hit run-scoring singles off Royals reliever Ricky Bottalico (4-1) in the top of the eighth to tie it at 7.</p>
        <p>Kelly Wunsch (0-2) took the loss for the White Sox, playing under Manager Jerry Manuel for the first time since he served an eight-game suspension.</p>
        <p>ATHLETICS 7, RANGERS 6: Jeremy Giambi had three hits and drove in three runs and visiting Oakland salvaged the finale of a wild series.</p>
        <p>Texas won by 17-16 on Friday and came back for an 11-10 victory Saturday. The teams combined for 67 runs and 88 hits in three games.</p>
        <p>Giambi's brother, Jason, who hit a pair of two-run homers the previous day, added an R.B.I. double in the eighth that put the Athletics ahead, 7-4.</p>
        <p>Omar Olivares (3-3) got the victory, and Doug Davis (0-1) took the loss.</p>
        <p>MARINERS 8, ANGELS 2: John Halama pitched six strong innings and Edgar Martinez led off a four-run sixth with a homer for host Seattle.</p>
        <p>Halama (4-0) didn't give up a hit after surrendering a run on two singles in the first inning. He struck out a career-high eight and walked three.</p>
