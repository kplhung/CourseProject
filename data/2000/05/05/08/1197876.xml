        <p>As Tom Traeger's collection of portable electronic devices grew, he saw the day approaching when he would own more gadgets than he could comfortably carry. He imagined something that would let him wear his cell phone, his organizer and even his pager at the same time and give him easy, quick access to any of them. He imagined, in fact, something like a shoulder holster.</p>
        <p>The result was the e-Holster, an accessory that closely resembles a gun holster and can be worn completely concealed under a suit jacket or sweater. The e-Holster was designed by Jerry Ahern of Commerce, Ga., a firearms concealment expert whom Mr. Traeger expected to bring an intuitive feel to the problem. Designers of gun holsters, he reasoned, should really know the ergonomics of easy access.</p>

        <p>As Tom Traeger's collection of portable electronic devices grew, he saw the day approaching when he would own more gadgets than he could comfortably carry. He imagined something that would let him wear his cell phone, his organizer and even his pager at the same time and give him easy, quick access to any of them. He imagined, in fact, something like a shoulder holster.</p>
        <p>The result was the e-Holster, an accessory that closely resembles a gun holster and can be worn completely concealed under a suit jacket or sweater. The e-Holster was designed by Jerry Ahern of Commerce, Ga., a firearms concealment expert whom Mr. Traeger expected to bring an intuitive feel to the problem. Designers of gun holsters, he reasoned, should really know the ergonomics of easy access.</p>
        <p>Mr. Traeger's company, Personal Electronics Concealment of St. Augustine, Fla., sells the e-Holster, along with his newest product, the e-BeltPouch, from its Internet site (www.eholster.com). The e-BeltPouch attaches to an ordinary belt and holds a cell phone or an organizer in a sideways position, permitting the wearer to sit down without fear of losing the device.</p>
        <p>The basic e-Holster, in nylon, costs $99.95; a leather version is $119.95. The e-BeltPouches range in price from $47.95 to $84.95.</p>
        <p>With a hand-held organizer on one side, a cell phone on the other and a pager clipped to the harness, the e-Holster wearer can look like a road warrior, which Mr. Traeger acknowledges is part of the point. ''There is a little macho thing to it,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But that little macho thing might be a problem. ''I don't think it's a very good idea,'' a San Francisco Police Department official at the department's shooting range said. ''It would certainly be a concern for any officer. They'd have to be on the alert.''</p>
