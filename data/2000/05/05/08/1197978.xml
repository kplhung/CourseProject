        <p>A traveler prints a boarding pass from her office computer, drives to the airport and then walks straight past the snaking line at the main counter. She drops her bags on a conveyer belt and dashes to the gate, where the bar code on her boarding pass causes her photograph to appear on the gate agent's computer screen. Her entire time in the airport, from curb to gate: less than 10 minutes.</p>
        <p>At the moment, this scenario is little more than a dream for all but a few, elite passengers. Airports are more crowded than ever, and lines are sharply longer than they were even a few years ago.</p>
        <p>But in a competition to attract the business travelers responsible for much of the carriers' revenue, airlines are spending tens of millions of dollars on new technology. They hope to whisk passengers through terminals more quickly, redefining what industry executives glumly call ''the airport experience.''</p>
        <p>By the end of the year, Continental Airlines plans to have 300 A.T.M.-like computers across the country that allow people to print their own boarding passes and baggage tags. Delta Air Lines has spent $750 million over the last two years wiring airports and preparing to introduce similar gadgets. Northwest Airlines responds to canceled flights at its hubs by rolling out banks of wireless phones with direct connections to its reservations desk.</p>
        <p>And Alaska Airlines, the most aggressive in using technology recently, has begun to allow people with electronic tickets to print boarding passes from home or office computers. As part of a pilot program, it has also scanned the driver's licenses of about 500 frequent fliers into its computer system. The bar code on the boarding pass retrieves both their driver's license and a larger photo so travelers never have to reach into their wallets before boarding the plane.</p>
        <p>For now, business travelers are the main beneficiaries of the improvements. Some of the initiatives, such as calling passengers' cell phones to tell them about a late flight, are available only to the top tier of frequent fliers, and others, like the kiosks, appeal mainly to travelers who do not check bags.</p>
        <p>Continental has even installed a kiosk in the lobby of AT&amp;T's headquarters in New Jersey so travelers there can get a boarding pass before they arrive at the airport. And Northwest is testing a program that allows employees of 10 midwestern companies to print their own passes off the airline's Web site.</p>
        <p>But unlike some other recent perks for corporate road warriors -- like expanded first-class sections or the installation of double beds on overnight flights -- much of the new technology will eventually be available for all passengers to use, industry experts said.</p>
        <p>''Airports weren't designed for the volumes they're now getting,'' said Michael L. Zea, a vice president in Mercer Management Consulting's airline practice. ''There's a lot of strain on the system, and technology can be very helpful in easing that.''</p>
        <p>Of course, automated systems are not always reliable. During a threatened strike by U S Airways employees in March, passengers holding electronic tickets needed old-fashioned paper tickets to have any hope of getting a seat on another carrier. And if the airlines eventually replace agents with the machines, they could both anger their unions and force passengers to do more work to board a plane, travel experts said.</p>
        <p>But after a year in which consumer complaints more than doubled from their 1998 level, industry executives say that shortening the lines at their airport counters is a sure-fire way to boost their carrier's images.</p>
        <p>As air travel has surged during the long economic expansion and both the size of airports and airline staffs have failed to keep up, the average amount of time that travelers spend in line at the main counter has reached 16 minutes, up 20 percent from three years ago, according to Airport Interviewing and Research, a White Plains company that surveys passengers. The stricter security standards that the government has adopted in recent years have added to the lines, as well.</p>
        <p>As a result, no matter what travelers think of folding themselves into a middle seat or drinking the airlines' mediocre coffee, they will generally be happy if their trips take less time than they have come to expect, airline executives say. ''You can make up for a lot of coffee sins by having a line that's been reduced,'' said Dirk C. McMahon, the senior vice president for ground operations at Northwest Airlines. And, at $10,000 apiece, the machines cost much less than additional employees.</p>
        <p>The stakes are high enough to have caused recent lawsuits between airlines with different views about how best to move passengers through airports. Continental has sued United to force it to remove metal templates on baggage X-ray machines that prevent passengers, including Continental's, from carrying large bags onto airplanes at Dulles Airport near Washington.</p>
        <p>Continental says its planes' overhead compartments are large enough to fit the bags and that allowing customers to carry on luggage instead of checking it reduces delays. United says the big bags result in overstuffed bins that cause delays.</p>
        <p>Though it is unclear which argument holds the most sway with passengers, they clearly care deeply about the issue. Bill Harsh, a management consultant who flies more than 200,000 miles a year, said he had stopped flying United, once his main carrier, because he could no longer carry on his luggage. ''I had a bag that fit in every overhead compartment in America but did not fit through their template,'' said Mr. Harsh, who lives in the Maryland suburbs of Washington.</p>
        <p>A spokeswoman for United said the airline has received few complaints about the templates.</p>
        <p>For now, though, the biggest attempts to reduce lines involve technology. Delta and other carriers are putting up computer screens near gate counters in an attempt to answer easy questions, such as the reason for a delay, that often clog up lines. Northwest's agents in Detroit and Minneapolis are using hand-held computers to print boarding passes for passengers waiting in long lines.</p>
        <p>The initiative that is the furthest along is the installation of the ticket kiosks that print boarding passes. Alaska, Continental and Northwest have put them in dozens of airports, and British Airways and Alitalia, among others, use them in Europe. Delta has installed them in Boston, New York and Washington for shuttle flights, and United is now testing a version in Aspen, Colo.</p>
        <p>Airline executives say they have not cut any jobs because of the machines but likely would have had to hire more agents without the kiosks.</p>
        <p>Typically about six feet tall, the machines allow passengers with electronic tickets to insert credit cards, print boarding passes and sometimes change their seats or get tickets on earlier flights. The machines pose, in text form, the security questions that gate agents ask passengers who check in the old-fashioned way.</p>
        <p>For now, there is rarely a line, and almost never a long one, at the kiosks. Mary Anne Smith of Metuchen, N.J., used one of them last week at Newark International Airport before boarding a Continental flight on a business trip. ''They're quicker even than when there are no lines'' at the counters, she said. ''I don't have to talk to anyone.''</p>
        <p>They are mainly useful, however, for passengers who have no bags to check and no questions to ask.</p>
        <p>Only Alaska, in Anchorage and Portland, Ore., now permits passengers to print their own tags and then drop them onto a conveyer belt from which the luggage is X-rayed and put on the plane. The other carriers force passengers using the kiosks to wait in a line -- usually separate from the main one and shorter -- to check their bags.</p>
        <p>The airlines have also not fully explained the policies to travelers, analysts said. Ms. Smith, for example, said she believed she could not use the kiosk at all if she had wanted to check a bag.</p>
        <p>In addition, the kiosks do not yet give fliers the same control that talking to an agent does, particularly for frequent travelers whose requests the airlines often meet, noted Samuel C. Buttrick, an airline analyst at PaineWebber.</p>
        <p>''I can't ask that the seat next to me be left open. I can't ask about upgrade wait lists. I can't ask questions about the status of a connecting flight,'' Mr. Buttrick said, adding that he rarely uses the kiosks.</p>
