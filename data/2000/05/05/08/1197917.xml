        <p>The Devils have a grand opportunity to advance to the third round of the Stanley Cup playoffs for the first time since capturing the trophy in 1995. They are a victory away from reaching the conference finals for two reasons: they have raised their intensity level and their best players have been more effective than the opposition's.</p>
        <p>It happened against Florida in the opening round and it is happening against Toronto in the second round.</p>
        <p>The Devils defeated the Maple Leafs by 4-3 on Saturday night in Toronto, giving them a 3-2 lead in their four-of-seven-game Eastern Conference semifinal series. Game 5 was probably the best in the series for Toronto, but the Devils still prevailed, primarily because of an inspiring performance by Scott Stevens and a number of brilliant plays by Patrik Elias, Scott Gomez and John Madden.</p>
        <p>With goalie Martin Brodeur doing his part and the team making few mistakes in its zone, the Devils showed their resilience by coming back twice from one-goal deficits.</p>
        <p>After a strategy meeting here today, Stevens said the Devils were aware of what they had to do to wrap up the series Monday night in front of their home crowd at Continental Arena.</p>
        <p>''We've got to play hard and not give them any life,'' Stevens said. ''We've got speed like they do, but we've got to put it to work.''</p>
        <p>Referring to his head coach, Larry Robinson, Stevens added, ''And Larry is getting us to do the right things.''</p>
        <p>Ken Daneyko, who has teamed with Stevens to help kill all 28 Toronto power plays in the series, said: ''You can use all the cliches and check out the past. The bottom line is we stay focused on what we have to do, which is play with discipline.''</p>
        <p>Stevens, the Devils' captain, can easily be considered an intimidating force this spring. His focused performance Saturday night left an impact on the Maple Leafs.</p>
        <p>Along with playing a huge part in neutralizing Toronto's top line of Mats Sundin, Jonas Hoglund and Steve Thomas, Stevens delivered two crunching hits on Tomas Kaberle and Kevyn Adams that were reminiscent of the thunderous hit he delivered on Detroit's Slava Kozlov in the 1995 Stanley Cup finals, which the Devils swept.</p>
        <p>''I wanted to be physical,'' Stevens said. ''I always try to be physical. I got the hits and we got some goals. It was nice to catch two people in the middle of the ice. I think others will be thinking about it, too.''</p>
        <p>But Stevens was not the central figure in the melee that broke out at the conclusion of the game. The trouble started with Toronto's Darcy Tucker tangling with Brodeur, and Thomas with Scott Niedermayer.</p>
        <p>Fans pelted the Devils with soft drinks and other debris as players barked at each other in front of their benches before being escorted to the dressing rooms.</p>
        <p>Stevens did not think there would be any carry-over in Game 6.</p>
        <p>''That's closed,'' he said. ''It's too important to stay disciplined.''</p>
        <p>Niedermayer and Brodeur were the only Devils assessed penalties for the fight. Niedermayer drew a double-minor for roughing and cross-checking. Brodeur got a minor for roughing.</p>
        <p>Madden, whose only goal in the playoffs turned out to be the winner on Saturday, said, ''It's not going to help your team if you carry over.''</p>
        <p>Bobby Holik, who has been dominant on face-offs, was another player who did not think there would be lingering trouble.</p>
        <p>''The thing is we know what we can do to be successful, and fighting is not one of them,'' Holik said. ''What we've got to do is bring into the game the attitude like last night.''</p>
        <p>SLAP SHOTS</p>
        <p>Coach LARRY ROBINSON was pleased with everyone's performance in Game 5 and said he was particularly happy to see VLADIMIR MALAKHOV get his first goal in the playoffs. . . . The Devils will not skate Monday morning because Seton Hall will have its graduation ceremonies at Continental Arena. . . . Game 7, if needed, will be be Wednesday night in Toronto.</p>
