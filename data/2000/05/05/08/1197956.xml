        <p>Derek Jeter knew the game was over. And he knew that the Orioles knew it was over, too.</p>
        <p>He had seen that look on the faces of Yankees' opponents before when they had to face the supreme closer, Mariano Rivera. It was the look of losers.</p>
        <p>But, as Rivera reflected later, ''This is a game, and things happen.''</p>
        <p>Even to Rivera, who ended last season having successfully converted 22 straight save opportunities and who had saved a major league-leading 11 games already this season.</p>
        <p>But the Orioles did the unthinkable at Yankee Stadium yesterday -- they swatted Rivera for three runs in the ninth inning and salvaged the final game of their three-game series with a 7-6 victory. It was Rivera's second blown save of the season.</p>
        <p>The Orioles did not do it easily. Their 4-2 lead had disappeared in the eighth inning when Scott Brosius hit a grand slam off Mike Trombley.</p>
        <p>Then Rivera came on for what is usually the opposition's final, flailing at-bats. He gave up singles to Charles Johnson and Brady Anderson, yielded a run on another soft single to Delino DeShields to make it 6-5, and had runners on first and second with one out. Rivera was not mowing them down. But to Jeter, the Orioles had that losers' look.</p>
        <p>B. J. Surhoff then hit a problematic grounder to Wilson Delgado at second base. Manager Joe Torre thought Delgado, who is filling in for the injured Chuck Knoblauch, would throw to second to try to get the forceout. Instead, Delgado told him later, he was concerned that Anderson had passed him, and he wanted to make sure to get at least the out at first.</p>
        <p>Now, with runners on second and third, Albert Belle faced Rivera.</p>
        <p>Rivera got two strikes on Belle and the crowd of 52,559 was standing for this confrontation.</p>
        <p>Belle drilled a solid single to center that sent home two runs, produced a 7-6 lead and heralded the end of the Yankees' six-game winning streak.</p>
        <p>''Albert had big power swings early in the count to go to two strikes, then he cut down his swing to attack the ball well,'' Baltimore Manager Mike Hargrove said.</p>
        <p>Later, Belle, who declines to discuss much with reporters, made two obscene gestures to one who asked him for comment.</p>
        <p>Rivera was asked whether he has lost something this season, or if this was merely a day in the life of a closer.</p>
        <p>''No, I'm throwing exactly the same,'' he said. ''I know how I'm doing out there, and I felt just as good as I did all of last year.''</p>
        <p>He will not think about the pitch that Belle hit or the other three singles he gave up in the inning.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't work if you think about it,'' Rivera said. ''It makes no difference.''</p>
        <p>And Torre, whose club has a 13-2 record in games decided by two runs or less, said, ''I'll take my chances with Mariano coming in with a one-run lead every night of the week.''</p>
        <p>For the Orioles, Sidney Ponson looked good early -- no Yankee reached base or hit a ball to the outfield the first three innings, and he allowed only two runs in his six innings. Eventually, Mike Timlin got the save.</p>
        <p>Baltimore also received heroics at the plate (home run) and in the field (a diving stop to end an inning with runners in scoring position) from 39-year-old Cal Ripken Jr.</p>
        <p>''I don't think the guys were thinking about the streak now that it's over,'' Brosius said.</p>
        <p>''A loss like this,'' he said, ''leaves a bitter taste in your mouth.''</p>
        <p>Especially, he did not have to add, when the Yankees knew they had the game won.</p>
        <p>INSIDE PITCH</p>
        <p>BOB SHEPPARD's 50th season as the Yankees' public-address announcer evoked nostalgic appearances by PHIL RIZZUTO, DON LARSEN, YOGI BERRA, REGGIE JACKSON and BOBBY MURCER and earned the sonorous-voiced Sheppard a place on a plaque with other Yankee legends in Monument Park. In a pregame ceremony that included an introduction by WALTER CRONKITE, Sheppard was honored for his tenure and then given the afternoon off. Cronkite reminded the fans that Sheppard's first game in 1951 also marked Mickey Mantle's Yankee debut (wearing No. 6). EDDIE LAYTON, the organist, played Sheppard's favorite song, ''Mary Is a Grand Old Name,'' as the announcer's wife, MARY, and children, smiled. Sheppard's longtime backup, JIM HALL, whom Sheppard discovered in a speech contest at St. John's Prep 30 years ago, took over the game-time duties. . . . CAL RIPKEN JR.'s home run was his 408th, sending him past DUKE SNIDER and KEN GRIFFEY JR. for 28th place on the career list. . . . DWIGHT GOODEN, who is pitching for Tampa Bay and has a 2-1 record, returns to the Stadium Monday night as the starter. He will face ANDY PETTITTE.</p>
