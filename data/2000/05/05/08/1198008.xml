        <p>Tim Hardaway took a shot at the national news media today after the Heat's Game 1 victory, wondering aloud why Miami was always viewed as the underdog against the Knicks, irrespective of records and seedings.</p>
        <p>''Last three years, ever since we played against the Knicks, we were the underdogs,'' he said. ''Doesn't matter how many division titles or better records we had. Everybody is picking them to beat us.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks, who knocked off the higher-seeded Heat in 1998 and 1999, were picked to beat Miami by nearly every New York and Miami news media outlet. The Heat was seeded second this year, the Knicks third.</p>
        <p>Contrary to the way they played at times, the Knicks claimed they were not paying attention to the preseries hype and their being heavily favored to defeat the Heat in their second-round playoff series.</p>
        <p>''We respect those guys a lot,'' Marcus Camby said. ''They're a good, quality team. I don't think anybody in here was boasting of a sweep. Outside, maybe.''</p>
        <p>Charlie Ward said, ''They beat us three out of four games in the regular season, so how can we not understand what type of team they have?''</p>
        <p>Chris Childs added: ''Outsiders don't know. All they see is what they read. We don't think about sweeping anybody. We didn't think about sweeping Toronto.''</p>
        <p>And Latrell Sprewell said: ''I don't think anybody in this locker room has a sense that we're going to run right through them. We do feel confident we can win here and we do feel confident we can beat this team.''</p>
