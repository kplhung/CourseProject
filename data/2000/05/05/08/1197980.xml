        <p>For months, Jim Florio has been daring Jon S. Corzine, his opponent in the Democratic primary for the Senate, to meet him in a debate. And Mr. Corzine, whose many assets do not include a gift for the sound bite, has responded as though Mr. Florio were offering to buy him a drink of hemlock: no thanks. Maybe later.</p>
        <p>Later has arrived.</p>
        <p>Until now, the New Jersey Senate contest has largely consisted of Mr. Corzine's demonizing the former governor in expensive television commercials, and Mr. Florio's indicting Mr. Corzine's Wall Street background in the newspapers, while the four all-but-unknown Republicans have been all but invisible in the news media.</p>
        <p>But with the start of the debate season this week, the two Democrats will finally engage in direct give-and-take, and the Republicans may actually get some attention.</p>
        <p>To Mr. Florio, who has been denigrating Mr. Corzine's proposals as hopelessly naive, the initial Democratic encounter on Thursday will be the first opportunity to challenge Mr. Corzine on the costs of his ambitious plans for universal health care and free college tuition, or to quiz him on the workings of Washington, where Mr. Florio spent 15 years in the House of Representatives.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio, whose wide early lead in the polls has been eroding, can be expected to draw as sharp a contrast as possible between himself and Mr. Corzine, the former co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs &amp; Company; in recent speeches, he has said Democratic voters must choose between an amateur politician and a professional.</p>
        <p>To Mr. Corzine, who drew national attention not long ago when he admitted making insulting remarks about Italian-Americans, whose advisers have become inured to his mangling of applause lines, and who seems to shy away from the rough-and-tumble of confrontation, the four debates scheduled with the combative Mr. Florio will pose a crucial test of mettle and preparation.</p>
        <p>To voters, the debates promise the chance for some political theater after more than a year of mere previews, since Senator Frank R. Lautenberg announced that he would not seek another term. Both Mr. Florio and Mr. Corzine are said to be a bit thin-skinned, and the two have developed a barely concealed disdain for one another.</p>
        <p>The first debate, on Monday, will showcase the Republicans: Robert D. Franks, a four-term congressman from Union County; William L. Gormley, a veteran state senator from Margate, near Atlantic City; James W. Treffinger, the Essex County executive; and Murray Sabrin, a college finance professor.</p>
        <p>Both of this week's debates, which will be taped in Trenton, are being sponsored by The New York Times and the New Jersey Network, which will broadcast them statewide.</p>
        <p>In addition to a number of candidates' forums around the state, the Republicans will debate again on May 22 on the cable channel News 12, and then on May 26 on WPVI-TV, the ABC affiliate in Philadelphia. The primary is on June 6.</p>
        <p>Aides to each of the four Republicans said they expected that the debates would be watched by relatively small numbers of likely primary voters. Rick Shaftan, a consultant to Mr. Sabrin, said the ABC telecast, scheduled for the Memorial Day weekend, seemed ''designed to guarantee minimal viewership.''</p>
        <p>But he and others said that news coverage of the events could help stir interest in what is otherwise expected to be a low-turnout election.</p>
        <p>Clifford Zukin, a pollster and professor at Rutgers, said debates rarely decided elections anywhere but at the presidential level, although he said that they could change the tone of campaign news coverage. ''Suppose something happens: flubs, gaffes, insults, someone being skewered,'' he said. ''Local TV loves that kind of thing. If that happens, then there will be the indirect effect. Local news is the sleeping 800-pound gorilla.''</p>
        <p>On the Democratic side, Gerald M. Pomper, another political science professor at Rutgers, predicted that each candidate had as much to lose as to gain in the debates.</p>
        <p>''Everybody's strengths are also their weaknesses,'' he said. ''Florio will be very informed on all kinds of policy questions, but he may seem boring and arrogant. Corzine may be less informed, and may therefore look like more of a fresh face.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Corzine has been studying for the debates as if cramming for a final exam. Robert C. Janiszewski, the Hudson County executive, said he had played the role of Mr. Florio in about five practice sessions, with Robert Shrum, a media consultant, and Steven Goldstein, a co-manager of the campaign, also taking turns acting the former governor's part.</p>
        <p>Mr. Florio has held only one practice debate, his aides said.</p>
        <p>Despite all that practice, Mr. Corzine's advisers painted Mr. Florio as the heavy favorite. ''The strategic reason for Florio to want 400 debates is he knows he's the polished, professional politician and Jon's not,'' Mr. Janiszewski said. ''I think the public's gotten weary of that. But Florio's not thinking that way. Corzine just needs to be himself.''</p>
        <p>Other supporters of Mr. Corzine stressed that voters were electing a senator, not a semanticist or a specialist on the legislative process.</p>
        <p>''If depth of knowledge about government won elections, then both Jimmy Carter and Walter Mondale would've beaten Ronald Reagan,'' said Orin Kramer, an adviser to Mr. Corzine. ''And if political debating skills won elections, Michael S. Dukakis would've beaten George Bush, and Mario Cuomo would still be governor of New York.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Florio's aides said that Mr. Corzine appeared to be hedging against a meltdown before the cameras. Mr. Corzine declined an invitation to a League of Women Voters debate that was to have been carried by the ABC-TV affiliates in New York and Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>Instead, after Thursday's debate on the New Jersey Network, there will be debates on May 15 on WLIB-AM (1190), which is the premier black talk radio station in Manhattan but has only about 75,000 listeners in New Jersey; on May 16 at a synagogue in Livingston, sponsored by the MetroWest Jewish Federation, which has not even sought a broadcast partner; and on May 18 on News 12, which is available in fewer than 60 percent of the state's households.</p>
        <p>''We have a great deal of respect for NJN and Channel 12, but their viewership is low,'' said Jim Lanard, a Florio spokesman. ''We can only conclude that the Corzine campaign has made a strategic decision to keep the candidate off the broadcast TV stations.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Goldstein, of the Corzine campaign, responded: ''This is like what Roseanne Roseannadanna said: if it's not one thing, it's another. First Jim Florio, who avoided debates throughout his career, moaned and groaned about Jon not debating him. Then Jon agreed to not one, not two, but four debates. We suggest Jim Florio take a chill pill.''</p>
