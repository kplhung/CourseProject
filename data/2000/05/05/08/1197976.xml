        <p>It was an afternoon filled with nostalgia and sentiment as President Clinton returned here today both to revisit memories of his political life in Arkansas and to preside over a fund-raising reception for his wife's effort to be elected a United States senator from New York.</p>
        <p>Before an audience of more then 300 Arkansans, Mr. Clinton introduced Hillary Rodham Clinton as someone who would do ''a superb job'' as senator.</p>
        <p>To a crowd made up of her old friends, political associates, former fellow law school professors and child-advocate colleagues, Mrs. Clinton called the trip ''a very pleasant journey in time.''</p>
        <p>While Mrs. Clinton has campaigned throughout the state of New York as a Senate candidate, today's reception at the New State House Convention Center was one of the rare occasions when the president attended an event with his wife's  political campaign as its centerpiece. He appeared with her when she made a formal announcement of her candidacy in February, but did not speak at that event.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Mr. Clinton spoke effusively today about his wife, portraying hers as one of the most important races of the 2000 campaign year. ''I have spent the last almost 30 years having conversations with my wife about every conceivable issue,'' Mr. Clinton said. ''In my whole life, I've never known anyone who had a better grasp of the issues. I think the Senate would be a much better place if she were there.''</p>
        <p>Today's $250-a-plate reception, which raised about $100,000 for Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaign, seemed to be a personal pilgrimage as well as a political event for both Clintons. Before the President and Mrs. Clinton spoke to a decidedly partisan audience, the audience heard the two extolled by two of their closest political allies in this state: the former senators Dale Bumpers and David H. Pryor.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton repeated many of the themes that are fixtures of her speeches in New York. She talked about her opposition to school vouchers and the need to make health care more widely available. But she, like the president, also reminisced about her days in Arkansas.</p>
        <p>In Little Rock, where the president's change of voter registration from Arkansas to New York made front-page headlines, Mrs. Clinton's decision to seek office in another state has been a matter of some local controversy.</p>
        <p>But today's reception offered nothing but warm enthusiasm for the Clintons, who a day earlier attended the wedding of a staff member near Paris, Ark. And the President made clear his strong feelings about his native state, referring to Arkansas in his remarks as ''home'' and telling the audience of his plans to make frequent stays in an apartment to be included in the presidential library that will bear his name, which will be built near the convention center.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton took pains to explain to the audience that his wife's decision to run for the seat being vacated by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan was one that came to her at the urging of others.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Clinton did not mention Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, her Republican rival. But she bitterly chastised the Republican Party for advocating the use of a budget surplus to finance a large-scale tax reduction.</p>
        <p>Both Mrs. Clinton and the president talked about the role reversal they had undergone after Mrs. Clinton became a candidate. She spoke of the critique the president had offered her during her rehearsal of the speech in which she officially announced her candidacy.</p>
        <p>''I had and probably still have a lot to learn about being a candidate,'' Mrs. Clinton said. ''And I'm trying to do the very best job I can. But I want to take back every time I said to Bill, 'You know, you could have said it like this.' ''</p>
