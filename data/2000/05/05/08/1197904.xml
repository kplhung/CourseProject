        <p>Lucky, a new magazine from Conde Nast Publications, is -- there is no way around it -- a shoe fanatic's dream that borders on the compulsive.</p>
        <p>There are 11 editorial pages in the middle of the magazine, introduced with the headline, ''Shoes You Need! Shoes You'd Kill For! And Then Even Still More Shoes!'' There are patent pumps, Mary Janes, toe-ring platforms, satin wedges, metallic kid sandals, python slingbacks and calf-hair slides, crocodile T-straps daubed with rhinestones and iguana-leather mules.</p>
        <p>Because Lucky is ''a New Magazine about Shopping'' (to use the phrase running across the top of the magazine), each shoe comes with a price and a telephone number or Web site through which readers may buy the pony-skin pumps of their choosing.</p>
        <p>Of course, magazines have long offered merchandise in their editorial pages, increasingly blurring the lines between editorial content and advertising.</p>
        <p>So while the core idea behind Lucky may not be new, Lucky appears to break new ground for an American magazine in so brazenly and nakedly looking and reading like, well, a carefully created catalog.</p>
        <p>Lucky is the apotheosis of a slow-building trend. In the last few years, magazines have begun to engage in marketing and even selling product lines. They have also begun to provide readers with ordering information the way catalogs do.</p>
        <p>Time Inc.'s five-year-old In Style, a magazine about shopping that masquerades as a magazine about celebrities, features hundreds of pages every month packed with merchandise, accompanied by ''800'' numbers and Web site addresses. Marie Claire, published jointly by Hearst Magazines and Marie Claire Album, offers its own clothing line -- from inexpensive leather pants to cashmere sweaters -- that is available through an ''800'' number. Next month, the magazine will send subscribers a CD-ROM, on which they can view clothes and then buy them online through Bloomingdale's, a unit of Federated Department Stores.</p>
        <p>Magazines like Girl and Allure have set up boutiques in Bloomingdale's, using their magazines' names as a marketing tool to promote clothing lines and products. Martha Stewart Living spawned the catalog line Martha by Mail, which readers can use to buy items featured in the editorial pages of the magazine. And Stuff, the men's magazine from Dennis Publishing, is just that -- stuff to buy, leavened with an occasional article about a bear mauling or a semiconfessional interview with a starlet.</p>
        <p>Kim France, the editor in chief of Lucky, characterized Lucky as a hobby magazine and shopping as a woman's abiding passion.</p>
        <p>''It's the same way that you might look at a golf magazine and see a spread of nine irons,'' she said. ''Lucky is addressing one interest in women's lives, in a really obsessive, specific way.''</p>
        <p>Of course, the conceit that all women are interested in shopping as an activity -- not as a means to an end, but as an end in itself -- is not one to which every American consumer subscribes. But executives at Conde Nast, a unit of Advance Publications, appear to.</p>
        <p>Steven T. Florio, the president and chief executive of Conde Nast, said that the success of Lucky hinged on the American obsession with shopping.</p>
        <p>''You see it at all economic levels, whether it's 57th Street or people doing the mall thing,'' Mr. Florio said. ''Shopping is entertainment.''</p>
        <p>James Truman, Conde Nast's editorial director, who conceived the idea, said that the magazine should not be construed as some sort of fetishistic warping of consumer culture, but as the exuberant expression of a communal bonding experience.</p>
        <p>''When I walk around SoHo or Madison Avenue on a Saturday, I do not feel like I am in the middle of an acquisition frenzy, but a social activity,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The magazine, which will arrive on newsstands next week, is the first new magazine from the company since Conde Nast Sports for Women in 1996. Conde Nast plans to publish Lucky first as a quarterly, then as a monthly,</p>
        <p>The magazine's audience is young women, whom Ms. France described as ''postemancipation, prefamily.''</p>
        <p>''She is out of school and supporting herself and beginning to make real money,'' Ms. France said. ''She buys most of her furniture at Pottery Barn and most of her clothes at Banana Republic. But she has an eye for style.''</p>
        <p>The magazine itself is 202 pages of stuff, and 90 of those pages are advertisements for more stuff. (The advertisements were free for Conde Nast advertisers for the first issue.) There are a few feature articles, and they are accompanied by products to buy. Two decanters are offered in an article on wine. One costs $19.95 (Crate and Barrel), the other is $840 (Takashimaya). Most of the editorial pages consist of pictures with descriptive captions; page after page dutifully lists beauty products -- like toners, ''mattifiers'' and ''zit gels'' -- with prices and ways to acquire them.</p>
        <p>But the centerfold of the magazine is most telling. It is not a photograph of a model in a slinky Pucci slip ($920) or a newly stylish Burberrys raincoat, but of rows of makeup sponges. Which leads to the inevitable question: have we sunk to a level of consumer obsession so craven and silly that women are expected to be fascinated by a centerfold featuring cosmetic sponges, faux alpaca powder puffs and makeup wedges?</p>
        <p>''I think any reasonable girl would not want to spend a lot of time looking at a page full of makeup sponges, but she ought to be able to look at that page and say, 'Yes, I need that,' or, 'I need that,' '' Ms. France said.</p>
        <p>Glenda Shasho Jones, the president of Shasho Jones Direct, a company that creates catalogs for retailers, said consumers were starting to conceive of magazines as catalogs, especially as magazines become more and more crammed with advertising.</p>
        <p>''Consumers are using magazines not only for advice but for direction,'' she said. ''In the old days, you would go through a home magazine or a fashion magazine, and you would get ideas. Then you would have to go out and do the work yourself. Now, you read In Style, and you get the Web sites, the ''800'' numbers, the stores, the availability. And the Internet is going to goose it up even more.''</p>
        <p>Magazines can act as an authority, Ms. Shasho Jones said, because they are not selling the merchandise directly.</p>
        <p>''A catalog can only be an authority to a certain extent, and after that consumers know that the catalog has a vested interest in selling right off the page,'' she said.</p>
        <p>A potential pitfall for magazines that act as catalogs, Ms. Shasho Jones said, is if a consumer has a bad experience with a retailer whose merchandise is featured in the magazine and then blames the magazine indirectly.</p>
        <p>''The smarter the magazine, the smarter they will be about keeping a kind of Good Housekeeping seal of approval,'' she said. ''They will learn that they have to ask questions when they are promoting products.''</p>
        <p>Lucky tells readers only what to buy, not what not to buy. Still, Ms. France and Mr. Florio both emphasized that there would never be any cooperation between advertisers and the editorial staff. Ms. France said that advertisers and retailers had not even been sending her that many sample products, as is normal protocol with beauty and fashion editors at Conde Nast, where makeup and fashion closets are stacked to the rafters with lip liners and facial creams.</p>
        <p>''But I hear Christmas might be pretty nice,'' Ms. France said.</p>
        <p>And why the title Lucky?</p>
        <p>''Lucky had a sort of exuberant, unpretentious feel to it,'' Ms. France said. ''As in, anybody can get lucky, and the point of the magazine is that anybody can have style. It is not a gene possessed by a precious few.''</p>
        <p>Of course, there is a slight sexual connotation in the magazine's title, as in the suggestive phrase ''to get lucky.''</p>
        <p>''Yes,'' Ms. France said. ''And we did not think that was a minus or an asset. If that's one association people get when they see the magazine, that is fine.''</p>
