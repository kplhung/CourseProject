        <p>A few months ago, Latrell Sprewell referred to himself as ''not a morning person.'' He admitted he did not like to get up early to play basketball, especially those ungodly 12:30 p.m. Eastern tip-offs mandated by NBC.</p>

        <p>A few months ago, Latrell Sprewell referred to himself as ''not a morning person.'' He admitted he did not like to get up early to play basketball, especially those ungodly 12:30 p.m. Eastern tip-offs mandated by NBC.</p>
        <p>That's what, 6:30 a.m. in Hawaii?</p>
        <p>''I still don't like playing at that time,'' the Knicks forward said yesterday afternoon. ''But that doesn't make a difference. This is the playoffs.''</p>
        <p>Sprewell is right. This is the playoffs. And if he doesn't arise from his Game 1 slumber and counter Jamal Mashburn over the next week, the Knicks can sleep in until November.</p>
        <p>Maybe that's a reach for one Heat-Knick scrum. After all, Sprewell and his teammates are resilient, resourceful, able to find ways to come back to Madison Square Garden on Friday with home-court advantage.</p>
        <p>Yet, there had to be something disturbing about the way he was outscored and outplayed by Mashburn, something that said so much about the perception surrounding this series -- the one about New York having such a huge advantage in the mythical matchup department.</p>
        <p>It was supposed to work like this: Alonzo Mourning and Tim Hardaway are locks at center and point guard.  P. J. Brown vs. Larry Johnson is almost a tossup at power forward. But if Allan Houston had a clear edge over Dan Majerle at shooting guard going in, Sprewell was easily the choice over Mashburn.</p>
        <p>In a series that can hinge on so many different people and plays, whoever gets the better of that duel most likely moves his team forward.</p>
        <p>''It's a matchup that can go either way,'' Sprewell said after he missed 8 of 12 shots and got to the free-throw line only four times in the 87-83 Knick loss. ''He has advantages, and I have advantages. Today, he was able to get off and play a pretty good game for them.''</p>
        <p>Mashburn was short of unstoppable. But many of his 21 points came at crucial moments, with the Knicks a possession or two away from distancing themselves from the Heat. He made 9 of 9 free throws, going hard to the basket through mounds of muscle when he didn't have an open jump shot.</p>
        <p>And he played big. It's a basketball cliche. but with Mashburn it is apropos. At 6 feet 8 inches and 241 pounds, he is 3 inches taller and 50 pounds heavier than Sprewell. Physically, he is not a small forward.</p>
        <p>Throughout his career, Mashburn has made a habit of nullifying his size and height advantages by playing smaller, taking fadeaway jump shots instead of going straight up, settling for short runners instead of strong layups. He literally shrank himself around the basket, relying only on his natural finesse.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, he made a clutch 19-footer with six minutes left to tie the game. He scored 6 straight points at the end of the third quarter, punctuating the run with an incredibly difficult driving layup that gave Miami an 8-point lead. He maneuvered his way through the lane like a bumper car, hitting every Knick before putting the shot high up on the glass with his body in a jackknife position.</p>
        <p>He attributes his new accuracy and aggressiveness to being healthy after nursing so many nagging injuries in playoffs past. But there is a mind-set involved, too. He reads those monotonous matchup graphics, in which one guy is ranked over the other, one team favored to win the series in so many games.</p>
        <p>The three largest South Florida  newspapers that cover the Heat all picked New York in six games or less. In a series of weapons, Sprewell over Mashburn was a cinch. But when you get beyond the who-has-the-better-weapon-at-what-position game, Miami is in much better shape than people realize.</p>
        <p>''There was definitely a lot of hype going on,'' Marcus Camby said afterward. ''People were saying we were going to sweep 'em or we're going to handle them well. They forget they came back on us when we had like a 20-point lead. We're so evenly matched.''</p>
        <p>And it may indeed come down to Sprewell-Mashburn, the aftereffects of their matchup reverberating throughout the series.</p>
        <p>With Hardaway relatively healthy and directing traffic, Mashburn doesn't have to bring the ball up the court. He can do less dribbling and more catching and shooting. And if Sprewell is not in an offensive rhythm, Houston has to shoulder that much more of the scoring burden.</p>
        <p>Asked how the Heat defended him differently than Toronto in the first round, Sprewell candidly admitted how Miami double-teamed in the low post every time he received the ball. ''Toronto didn't do that until the third game,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Sprewell reaffirmed how special he can be in the postseason against Toronto, shutting down Vince Carter and shooting that picturesque step-back jumper over the Raptor Wunderkind to win Game 2 of the series. At the apex of the shot's release, you can see the incredible focus in his form and on his face. Nothing in the world meant more to him at that moment than making sure the ball went through the net. He went up against a player as determined as himself yesterday, a player no longer invisible when the game matters -- a small forward who played larger than himself in Game 1.</p>
