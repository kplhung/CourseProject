        <p>There are many stars in the bridge firmament, and an even greater number in the night sky at the new Hayden Planetarium in Manhattan. The link between the two is Johnny Wei, who was in charge of the structural engineering of the new building and plays regularly at Honors Club, at 115 West 57th Street in Manhattan. On the diagramed deal from the weekly imp game, he held the South cards and attempted a bridge contract that he would not, in his professional capacity, consider sound.</p>
        <p>After a weak two-spade bid is overcalled with two no-trump, a response of three diamonds is a transfer to hearts in the modern style. In a traditional style the bid is a mystery. North may have been hoping that his bid would be read as weak or invitational, but Wei not unnaturally treated it as forcing and continued to three no-trump. If Wei had made an inspired pass, North might have struggled home with nine tricks in three diamonds.</p>

        <p>There are many stars in the bridge firmament, and an even greater number in the night sky at the new Hayden Planetarium in Manhattan. The link between the two is Johnny Wei, who was in charge of the structural engineering of the new building and plays regularly at Honors Club, at 115 West 57th Street in Manhattan. On the diagramed deal from the weekly imp game, he held the South cards and attempted a bridge contract that he would not, in his professional capacity, consider sound.</p>
        <p>After a weak two-spade bid is overcalled with two no-trump, a response of three diamonds is a transfer to hearts in the modern style. In a traditional style the bid is a mystery. North may have been hoping that his bid would be read as weak or invitational, but Wei not unnaturally treated it as forcing and continued to three no-trump. If Wei had made an inspired pass, North might have struggled home with nine tricks in three diamonds.</p>
        <p>As it was, three no-trump needed some help from the defense. West led a heart, which proved to be unwise. South captured the 10 with the queen and led the diamond queen. The contract would have been doomed if West had played low; but the king was played, a subtle error.</p>
        <p>South played low, hoping for a three-two split that would allow him to run the suit subsequently. He had much to think about when East followed with the 10. The heart king now came from West, who was permitted to win. A third heart drove out the ace, and South was at the crossroads when he led the diamond five and West produced the six.</p>
        <p>If West had begun with K-9-6, any play would succeed. If West had begun with K-6 or K-6-3, meaning that East had false-carded with 10-9-3 or 10-9, it was vital to play a top honor. But South made the winning move by finessing the eight, resigning himself to a heavy defeat if East had false-carded.</p>
        <p>Now South was in full control. He ran the diamonds, coming down to two cards in each black suit, as did East. South could have led a club at this point, but made the slightly better play of a spade to the ace, with the jack to follow. The club king scored the ninth trick at the finish, and Wei had engineered an ''impossible'' game.</p>
