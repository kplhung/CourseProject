      <abstract>
        <p>Editorial says racketeering lawsuit filed against House majority whip, Tom DeLay, and his fund-raising empire by Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee puts spotlight on emergence of shadowy tax-exempt organizations that are secretly raising and spending unlimited sums of money to influence federal elections; urges House Ethics Committee to review propriety of DeLay's conduct; urges Congress to move immediately to prevent its members from controlling huge stashes of secret political money</p>

      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>A civil suit filed against the House majority whip, Tom DeLay, and his fund-raising empire by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee last week charged them with violating a federal racketeering law, the so-called RICO statute. The accusation was that Mr. DeLay extorted huge donations from corporate lobbyists and laundered the money through tax-exempt groups set up to avoid federal contribution limits and disclosure rules.</p>
        <p>The courts will have to decide whether such unsavory political fund-raising amounts to racketeering in a legal sense. But the suit spotlights a real problem -- the emergence of shadowy tax-exempt organizations that are secretly raising and spending unlimited sums of money to influence federal elections. Political groups can now gain tax-exempt status under section 527 of the federal tax code without having to register with the Federal Election Commission even though they are actively engaged in trying to influence federal elections. That is a dangerous expansion of the soft-money loophole that evades even the disclosure requirements imposed on soft money given to political parties.</p>

        <p>The courts will have to decide whether such unsavory political fund-raising amounts to racketeering in a legal sense. But the suit spotlights a real problem -- the emergence of shadowy tax-exempt organizations that are secretly raising and spending unlimited sums of money to influence federal elections. Political groups can now gain tax-exempt status under section 527 of the federal tax code without having to register with the Federal Election Commission even though they are actively engaged in trying to influence federal elections. That is a dangerous expansion of the soft-money loophole that evades even the disclosure requirements imposed on soft money given to political parties.</p>
        <p>The controversy that has arisen over this lawsuit should not obscure the immediate duty of the House Ethics Committee to review the propriety of Mr. DeLay's conduct. Nor should it distract Congress from passing legislation to stop federal officeholders like Mr. DeLay from using elaborate schemes to put their fund-raising outside the limits and disclosure requirements set by existing federal laws. In the longer term, of course, Congress must address more expansively the growing problem of unregulated soft-money donations. But for the sake of its own institutional integrity, Congress should immediately move to prevent its members from controlling huge stashes of secret political money.</p>
        <p>All candidates and officeholders have an ethical duty to fully disclose their campaign finance activities and to abide by contribution limits designed to protect the political system from corruption. These are basic principles that lawmakers on all sides of the campaign finance debate should be able to agree upon, and quickly.</p>
