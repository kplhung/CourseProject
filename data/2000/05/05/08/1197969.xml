        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Countries emerging from Communism may be experiencing a declining fertility rate (''Birthrate Dips in Ex-Communist Countries,'' news article, May 4), but this scenario is not necessarily permanent.</p>
        <p>Just as American women did after the post-World War II baby boom, women in the former Communist nations are postponing childbearing, though for different reasons. It doesn't mean that they have stopped having children, but it skews the statistic for now. They may even have the same number of babies but at later ages.</p>

        <p>More important than how many children a woman has are the conditions under which she has them. Having two children because she wants them, delaying childbearing to pursue education or having fewer children so they can be healthier and better educated -- all make good sense.</p>
