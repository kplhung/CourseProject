        <p>They were born in the dark years of the Depression, many to immigrants with scant education. Their childhood was marked by wartime sugar rationing and air-raid drills. At the end of junior high school, as World War II ended, they passed a rigorous entrance exam and embarked on an educational experience that would open doors to a brighter future.</p>
        <p>Over the weekend, those adventurers, the members of the Bronx High School of Science's class of 1950, came from as far as Denmark and Israel to recall how smart, ambitious students, regardless of their backgrounds, were confident that they could grab a piece of the American dream.</p>
        <p>''It was 100 percent the work ethic,'' Jay Kislak said of the education he received from teachers hand-picked from around the city. ''They told you, 'If you work hard, there's no limit.' You knew that you were the greatest because your teachers, your principal and your parents were telling you that.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Kislak went on to become an internist and is now chief of infectious diseases at St. Vincents Hospital.</p>
        <p>Several alumni recalled that after going to Bronx Science, their college classes seemed easy. And many said the scientific methods instilled in students by the school resonated beyond the world of test tubes. ''You learned how to look at life in a very specific way,'' said Marion Liebowitz, a retired genetic counselor. ''You'd use it to say, 'How do I examine any kind of a statement?' ''</p>
        <p>As at any reunion of people in their late 60's, there were the standard jokes about gray hair and balding pates, and anecdotes of sneaking cigarettes between classes. But as 256 alumni, more than a third of the class, toured their alma mater, clinked wine glasses at the American Museum of Natural History, and dined under the ornately carved ceilings of the Harmonie Club on Fifth Avenue, it was clearly not a typical high school experience they were talking about.</p>
        <p>Absent were the memories of homecoming games (the school had no football team); instead, former classmates recalled their days in the  Protozoa Club. There were no real nerds among the 700-odd members of the class, because, as Loraine Cole Ehrlich, a retired history teacher, said with a laugh, ''I guess everybody was a nerd.''</p>
        <p>But even in this cerebral group, a few stood out. ''I remember Steve Weinberg got up to say something in class one day,'' recalled Verna Spinrad, a retired teacher. ''My friend Judy poked me and said, 'He's very smart.' '' Mr. Weinberg, along with his classmate, Sheldon L. Glashow, won the 1979 Nobel Prize in physics -- accounting for two of the five Nobels won by Bronx Science graduates since the school opened in 1938.</p>
        <p>But perhaps the class of 1950's biggest claim to fame was introducing girls into Bronx Science.</p>
        <p>''Right after World War II, the principal, Morris Meister, decided that maybe girls have a brain too,'' said Ms. Ehrlich, who organized the reunion. ''We were the first group of girls to do all four years there. Eighty percent of us had full-time careers and raised a family.''</p>
        <p>Although their class was only one-third female, these girls were far from intimidated.</p>
        <p>''Oh, the way to impress the males was to say something smart, not to sit in the corner like you didn't have a brain,'' recalled Ms. Liebowitz.</p>
        <p>Both the valedictorian and salutatorian were women, and alumnae include the first woman to be dean of a law school and a physicist elected to the National Academy of Sciences.</p>
        <p>One alumnus, Irv Cohen, recalled  the New York City Parks commissioner, Henry Stern, the youngest member of the class, as ''a little tiny kid, sort of a curiosity.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Stern grinned. ''They considered me a pet,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Touring the ''new'' Bedford Park campus, built in 1958, which replaced they school they went to, at East 183rd Street and Creston Avenue, the graduates marveled at the changes. While mechanical drawing remains part of the curriculum, much of it is now done on computers.</p>
        <p>The school is still considered a center of excellence, with a selection process that weeded out all but 510 of 25,000 applicants this year.</p>
        <p>But the student body, which in 1950 was about 85 percent Jewish and almost all white, now reflects the city's diversity. And when visitors were told of the ratio of girls to boys today, 51 percent to 49 percent, they broke into applause.</p>
        <p>For many, careers in chemistry and nuclear physics coincided with the onset of the Cold War.</p>
        <p>But for one nuclear physicist, it was the Internet that changed his life. A year and a half ago, living in Los Alamos, the physicist, Alan Charmatz, received an e-mail message from Joan Reagan, a school friend he had not heard from in 50 years, who had found his address online.</p>
        <p>''I sent out an e-mail saying, 'Do you remember me?' said Ms. Reagan, a retired science teacher ''And he sent back a long e-mail saying, 'I hope you're happy, I hope you had a nice life, and I notice you haven't changed your name.' ''</p>
        <p>After a few months of e-mail correspondence, he visited her in upstate New York. ''We confirmed a lot of our feelings that we'd both had,'' said Mr. Charmatz a little shyly. By the end of the visit, he had proposed.</p>
        <p>Ms. Reagan, beaming as she sat beside her husband, said she thinks Bronx Science couples, which are common in their class, make particularly good matches. ''You understand each other's obsessive-compulsive behavior,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Her classmates seem to agree. Since her wedding, Ms. Reagan said, ''I've gotten e-mail from a number of people saying, 'Hurray! You finally married someone from Bronx Science!' ''</p>
