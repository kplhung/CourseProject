        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Political collapse and economic uncertainty after Communism's fall may have contributed to Eastern and Central Europe's population decline (news article, May 4). But the fear of ''de-population'' has caused the erosion of women's reproductive rights in the region.</p>
        <p>The Hungarian Parliament is about to pass a restrictive abortion law, and the Russian Parliament has likewise been presented with legislation seriously restricting access to abortion. Across the region, employers discriminate against women of childbearing age because of a long, mandatory maternity leave. Domestic violence laws are nonexistent or poorly enforced.</p>

        <p>Until Eastern and Central Europe begin to protect and promote their rights, women will continue to feel that these countries are not safe places to raise their children.</p>
