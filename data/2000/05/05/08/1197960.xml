        <p>The nightly news is often full of stories about violence and racial strife across the world and around the corner.</p>
        <p>That's why, for the last five years, Jacqueline Sowell has loved to wake up in the morning, put on her uniform and go to work as a waitress in the coffee shop at the Holiday Bowl, a faded bowling alley on a faded street in the faded Crenshaw district west of downtown Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Walking into the Bowl renewed her faith. It showed her day after day just how well people of diverse backgrounds and races can get along.</p>
        <p>''It's like a United Nations in there,'' she said the other day. ''Our employees are Hispanic, white, black, Japanese, Thai, Filipino. I've served grits to as many Japanese customers as I do black. We've learned from each other and given to each other. It's much more than just a bowling alley. It's a community resource.''</p>
        <p>But shortly after 1 a.m. on Saturday, after 42 years of strikes, spares and brotherhood, in Ms. Sowell's words, the Holiday Bowl was closed. The building is being sold. According to the property owner, Marshall Siskin, the bowling alley has been losing money for 15 years.</p>
        <p>''Like all things,'' Mr. Siskin said, ''it's reached a point where it has to change.'' Maybe so, but not without a fight, Ms. Sowell said. A few hours after the last balls thundered down the lanes, a group of her neighbors, co-workers and friends were standing outside, holding signs, declaring the Bowl ''A Landmark of Diversity'' and urging the new owners and the city to ''Preserve Not Destroy.''</p>
        <p>''I'm doing everything I can to save it,'' said Ms. Sowell, 46, who grew up in the neighborhood. ''I learned how to use chopsticks in the coffee shop. We're trying to get a loan to make it a worker-owned business.''</p>
        <p>The design of the building, with its sloped roof, plate glass windows and orange and white facade, is another reason the Bowl should be saved, said John English, a volunteer with the Los Angeles Conservancy, a nonprofit preservation group, which is working with Ms. Sowell. Mr. English said the Bowl was an example of ''Googie'' -- a 1950's architectural style regarded as being born in California. Ms. Sowell, Mr. English and their allies hope they can convince the city's Cultural Heritage Commission of the Bowl's significance and make it harder for it to be torn down.</p>
        <p>But everyone admits the real significance of the Holiday Bowl is not the bricks, but the people.</p>
        <p>''What you find at the Holiday Bowl,'' Mr. English said, ''is what's best about Los Angeles, this incredible mix of people. You have something that you can't just tear down and re-create somewhere else.''</p>
        <p>The Bowl was built in 1958 by a group of Japanese-American businessmen when the Crenshaw district was heavily Japanese. But there were also blacks and Latinos, and the neighborhood, in those days, was one of the most diverse in the city. The Bowl quickly became a neighborhood landmark. ''Meet me at the Bowl,'' echoed across the playgrounds and shops.</p>
        <p>In 1992, as scores of other businesses and buildings were being burned to the ground during the riots after the acquittal of Los Angeles police officers in the beating of a black motorist, Rodney G. King, a group of regulars stood outside and told looters that the Bowl was ''our place.''</p>
        <p>''We are the only building around here,'' Ms. Sowell said, ''that withstood the riots without so much as a broken window.''</p>
        <p>On Friday night it was time to say goodbye.</p>
        <p>Ed Nakamoto, 56, who was born in a Japanese-American internment camp, had been going to the Bowl for 36 years. ''Everybody comes through here eventually,'' Mr. Nakamoto said. ''The other day, a guy I hadn't seen since high school came through. It's like one big happy family. A lot of blacks and Asians have been bowling together for 40 years. The only color I see is on a bowling ball.''</p>
        <p>As Mr. Nakamoto talked, stroking his white beard, Barbara Fisher-Shaw, an African-American who has bowled there for 12 years, walked up and threw her arms around him and told him not to give up.</p>
        <p>Nearby, on a wall, was a list of the people who have bowled a perfect score. The names reflect the diversity that has been at the heart of the Bowl: Deguchi, Crist, Marshall, Washington, Smith, Lee, and Furukawa.</p>
        <p>George Furukawa was the third person to bowl 300 at the Holiday Bowl. ''I was one of the first people to come here, and now it looks like I'm going to be one of the last,'' Mr. Furukawa said on Friday night, sipping a beer at the bar crowded with old friends, all of them with one eye on a Los Angeles Lakers basketball game and one eye on the clock.</p>
        <p>Mr. Furukawa is 83 and has not bowled since 1986 when a mugger's bullet shattered his leg. But he still lives in the neighborhood, and until last weekend he went to the Bowl ''every day unless I was sick.''</p>
        <p>As the night wore on, people began to cry and hug each other. The ''Friday Five'' bowling league was still on the lanes. ''This is where I grew up,'' said the league's secretary, Stacee Fujii, 33. ''I started when I was 8. My whole family bowled.''</p>
        <p>''As racial as everybody is these days,'' she continued, ''this place is very integrated. To see it close, it's very emotional.''</p>
