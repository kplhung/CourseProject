        <p>Gov. George E.

The panel would also propose regulations to improve the use of the precise forensic science of DNA profiling by the state's criminal justice system.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki said that the committee would work to find the causes of mistaken convictions, and would make proposals to use forensic DNA more thoroughly in future investigations.</p>
