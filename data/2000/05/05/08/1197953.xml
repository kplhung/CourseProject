        <p>The Irish Republican Army's commitment over the weekend to subject its secret arsenal of weapons to international inspection should reopen the path to peace in Northern Ireland.

        <p>The Irish Republican Army's commitment over the weekend to subject its secret arsenal of weapons to international inspection should reopen the path to peace in Northern Ireland. By ending its longstanding refusal to make a meaningful gesture toward disarmament, the I.R.A. has removed a critical barrier to fulfilling the two-year-old Good Friday peace agreement and establishing a new political order in Ulster. Catholic and Protestant political leaders must now work together -- and with paramilitary leaders on both sides -- to translate this hopeful development into a durable peace.</p>
        <p>The I.R.A.'s statement came just 12 hours after the British and Irish governments announced that they had agreed on a new formula to restart the suspended home-rule government in Belfast. Under the plan, the power-sharing arrangement that Britain suspended in February after only eight weeks in operation would resume on May 22. The February deadlock was due in large part to the I.R.A.'s intransigence over disarmament. At the time, David Trimble, the pivotal Protestant leader, was threatening to give up his post over the arms issue.</p>
        <p>The I.R.A.'s new proposal meets the British and Irish governments' demand that paramilitary groups state clearly that they will put their arms ''completely and verifiably beyond use.'' The group said some arms dumps would be open for inspection within weeks as a confidence-building measure and would be subject to re-inspection at regular intervals by representatives of an international disarmament commission to verify that weapons are not being used. The I.R.A. also said it would reappoint representatives to the commission.</p>
        <p>To move from confidence-building steps to a broader disarmament, the I.R.A. will have to devise long-term timetables for setting aside all of its explosives, hand grenades, assault rifles and pistols, subject to verification. The Protestant paramilitaries must do the same.</p>
        <p>The I.R.A.'s long-awaited commitment was not an easy one for the group to make. Its leaders deserve credit for overcoming doubts about disarmament among the organization's most militant members. Reciprocal steps must be made by the Unionist side. Mr. Trimble greeted the I.R.A.'s announcement cautiously, but he conceded that it ''does appear to break new ground.'' He must now follow through on his recent promise to bring his party back into a home-rule government if the I.R.A. made a firm commitment to disarm, without waiting for actual disarmament to begin.</p>
        <p>The British and Irish governments have postponed by a year the deadline for completing a number of additional measures that are needed to insure peace. They include development of a new police force with a more balanced membership among Roman Catholic and Protestant officers and new provisions for respecting human rights. These goals should not be neglected in the months ahead.</p>
        <p>Both Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and his Irish counterpart, Bertie Ahern, have shown admirable persistence in reviving the Good Friday agreement. Mr. Trimble and Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the I.R.A.'s political wing, have each shown courage in making the compromises necessary to end three decades of sectarian conflict that has cost more than 3,600 lives. The I.R.A. and the Protestant paramilitary groups have maintained cease-fires for nearly three years now. With the prospect of renewed self-rule, there are grounds for optimism in Northern Ireland among the overwhelming majority who yearn for a fair and lasting peace.</p>
