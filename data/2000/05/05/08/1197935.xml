        <p>The pass was routine, the kind teams in the National Basketball Association concede on a nightly basis. But these are the playoffs, and as the Miami Heat players broke from their pregame practice this morning, P. J. Brown decided to take one last look at his scouting report on the Knicks.</p>
        <p>''Coach Riley told us before we left that you never know what can happen,'' Brown said. ''Go over it one more time and find some little thing you can use. I've been out of school for a while, but I still read a little bit now and then.''</p>

        <p>The pass was routine, the kind teams in the National Basketball Association concede on a nightly basis. But these are the playoffs, and as the Miami Heat players broke from their pregame practice this morning, P. J. Brown decided to take one last look at his scouting report on the Knicks.</p>
        <p>''Coach Riley told us before we left that you never know what can happen,'' Brown said. ''Go over it one more time and find some little thing you can use. I've been out of school for a while, but I still read a little bit now and then.''</p>
        <p>Brown's extra homework paid off in a key steal with 28.3 seconds to play. Trailing by 85-83, the Knicks desperately needed a basket and appeared in good position as Latrell Sprewell started down the lane and swung the ball to Allan Houston on the left wing.</p>
        <p>Houston immediately looked for Patrick Ewing in the low post and made what proved to be a careless pass inside. Brown, who said he really was not guarding anybody at that moment, rotated from behind Ewing and tipped the ball and Game 1 into the Heat's hands.</p>
        <p>Alonzo Mourning clinched the 87-83 victory on a jump shot with 5.6 seconds left, and the Knicks were left to ponder what to do about Brown and the Heat's lesser stars on Tuesday night in Game 2 of the Eastern Conference semifinals.</p>
        <p>''I knew the play,'' Brown said. ''I saw it exactly the way it happened when we walked through it this morning. I don't think Houston ever saw me.''</p>
        <p>Brown's performance could be Miami's role model for this series, which has started with the Heat believing that it had outsmarted and outmuscled the Knicks. He contributed a career playoff-high 16 rebounds, 8 points and 2 steals from his strong forward position.</p>
        <p>The Knicks should know that Brown can hurt them. His performance today was reminiscent of Game 5 last year, when he scored 16 points and grabbed 12 rebounds. In four games against the Knicks this season, Brown averaged 11.8 points and 7.3 rebounds.</p>
        <p>Forward Jamal Mashburn delivered 21 points, picking up important slack caused by the hobbled point guard Tim Hardaway, whose sprained left foot limited him to playing traffic cop for his frontcourt. Hardaway had 7 assists and scored only 6 points on 2-of-8 shooting and was limping for most of his 30 minutes on the court.</p>
        <p>Hardaway, who needed his foot retaped at halftime, said he would play as much as possible the rest of the series.</p>
        <p>''The only way it's going to heal 100 percent is if I take a couple of months off,'' Hardaway said. ''I can't do that now.''</p>
        <p>Mashburn said: ''The Knicks will still have to account for him out there. Whether he can get to the basket or not, they'll still have to respect him. He gives us confidence just by being out there.''</p>
        <p>The Heat was especially energized on defense, clogging passing lanes, causing bad shots and forcing timely turnovers.</p>
        <p>''There's nothing pretty about it,'' Hardaway said. ''We just scramble and jump in their face, make them think about arcing the ball a little more and changing their rhythm. Hopefully, they'll miss and we'll get the rebounds.''</p>
        <p>The Knicks shot 42.3 percent, which was not particularly impressive, and they were held without a field goal during the final 5 minutes 34 seconds.</p>
        <p>''We were up and in them on defense,'' Heat Coach Pat Riley said. ''But they missed some shots down the stretch. Larry Johnson was wide open one time, Chris Childs was wide open. But we were committed at the end of the game not to let them line us up for a foul or shoot over us. We just made two or three huge plays at the end to win it.''</p>
        <p>The Heat also got quality minutes from Clarence Witherspoon, Bruce Bowen, Otis Thorpe and Anthony Carter, who contributed a combined 18 points, 9 rebounds and 8 fouls off the bench. The Heat had seven steals, with the biggest coming from Brown with 28.3 seconds to play.</p>
        <p>''Zo and Hardaway are going to do what they do,'' Brown said. ''They're going to score and lead us. Me, Witherspoon, Mash and the other guys, we got to be that third man out there. We do that together, and we've got a good chance to win this series.''</p>
