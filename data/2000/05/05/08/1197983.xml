        <p>Decisions have been made involving several large accounts.</p>
        <p>Alberto-Culver in Melrose Park, Ill., expanded its relationship with Euro RSCG Worldwide, part of Havas Advertising, by naming Euro RSCG Wnek Gosper in London to handle creative work for the St. Ives line of hair, body and skin care products, which had been handled for about a year by M&amp;C Saatchi in London. Billings were estimated at $30 million. The decision came after a four-month review that had been narrowed to Euro RSCG Wnek Gosper, M&amp;C Saatchi and Lowe Lintas &amp; Partners, part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. Euro RSCG Tatham in Chicago handles Alberto-Culver brands like Tresemme hair-care products and Mrs. Dash seasonings.</p>

Euro RSCG Tatham in Chicago handles Alberto-Culver brands like Tresemme hair-care products and Mrs. Dash seasonings.</p>
        <p>Unilever is expanding its relationship with Bartle Bogle Hegarty in London by naming that agency's Asian-Pacific operation, based in Singapore, to handle the introduction in Indonesia of a fabric freshener brand called Refresh. Bartle Bogle, which is 49 percent owned by the B Com3  Group, has been a Unilever roster agency since 1990. The decision for the account, with undisclosed billings, was made without a review.</p>
        <p>And the San Francisco office of FCB Worldwide, part of True North Communications, and Palm Inc. are parting ways after the New York office of FCB was named to handle the $350 million Compaq Computer Corporation account. Billings for the Palm account were estimated at $70 million. Jim Adamson, a spokesman for Palm in Santa Clara, Calif., declined to elaborate on Palm's plans for replacing the agency.</p>
