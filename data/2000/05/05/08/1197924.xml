        <p>J. T. Houk, the impresario behind one of the nation's largest charities, is no stranger to controversy.</p>
        <p>The Internal Revenue Service once tried to revoke his organization's tax-exempt status. Last year, Congress and the I.R.S. put a stop to a charitable giving strategy promoted aggressively by Mr. Houk that critics said benefited donors more than recipients.</p>
        <p>Now Mr. Houk is facing a challenge to what he claims is the cornerstone of his brand of philanthropy: finding ways to have donors and volunteers pay themselves for their charitable deeds.</p>
        <p>Rejecting the notion that anyone ought to perform a charitable service for free, Mr. Houk derides what he calls the ''charity poverty syndrome.'' He acknowledges that some people make exceptional volunteers, but says, ''Volunteers give you dregs, not dynamite,'' especially as fundraisers. ''You get what you pay for.''</p>
        <p>Donors who entrust money instead to his Falls Church, Va., charity, known as the National Heritage Foundation, set up individual accounts that mimic foundations at a fraction of the cost. In turn, they are eligible for immediate tax deductions for their gifts and are encouraged to use the money in their accounts to pay salaries and expenses for themselves and their families.</p>
        <p>Donors need not worry about the low pay charities offer, says the pitch on the foundation's Web site, ''We would strive to bring your salary up to private industry standards.''</p>
        <p>But many in the charitable world bridle at the notion that people have any business paying themselves to carry out their charitable impulses.</p>
        <p>''It's like paying the Girl Scouts to sell cookies,'' said Jack Shakely, president of the California Community Foundation, which is one of many competing charities that also offer ''donor advised'' funds, which allow donors to set up individualized accounts with funds earmarked for charity.</p>
        <p>The California Community Foundation bars donors from paying themselves or family members. ''It's not illegal, but it just doesn't pass the 60-second smell test,'' Mr. Shakely said.</p>
        <p>The National Heritage Foundation, however, is far less restrictive, one reason why at last count tens of millions of dollars from some 4,000 foundations had been set aside for charity under its auspices. How much of that money will ever go to worthwhile causes is far from clear.</p>
        <p>Administrative and marketing fees payable to National Heritage, some of which are split with financial advisers who bring in the funds, come right off the top. Then there are also the many families who dip into their National Heritage accounts to pay themselves salaries or defray expenses.</p>
        <p>Dr. W. John Martin of Rosemead, Calif., set up his charity to fund research on viruses that no university or government agency would underwrite.</p>
        <p>Robert and Cynthia Fleming of Poulsbo, Wash., used some of the money they gave to National Heritage to send their son to Mexico for three years, calling it missionary work. While the Flemings could have tried to create their own foundation, it would have been ''very time consuming and expensive,'' said Ms. Fleming, who heard Mr. Houk's spiel on radio and was persuaded.</p>
        <p>Jerome T. Barrett of Falls Church, Va., heard about National Heritage from a colleague. What he finds most appealing was foundation officials' willingness to look after many of the details of running a charity. ''They take care of the money, and they will defend you in court'' if a donor runs afoul of I.R.S. rules, Mr. Barrett said.</p>
        <p>He uses his charity, Friends of FMCS History Foundation, to sponsor research on a book he is writing on the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, where he once worked. His foundation no longer has enough assets to allow him to dole himself a salary, but it covers the rent on his office.</p>
        <p>While Mr. Houk says the National Heritage Foundation ultimately controls where every dollar under its management goes, many of his competitors want Congress to outlaw use of such accounts to siphon money to donors and their families. The effort to curb this practice was reported last Friday in The Wall Street Journal. The Clinton administration has proposed going further: restricting the gifts these funds can make to charities registered with the Internal Revenue Service. That would preclude donors from giving to foreign charities and needy individuals.</p>
        <p>Mr. Houk makes no bones about favoring old-fashioned entrepreneurship as a way to invigorate the nation's charities. Accustomed to being the focus of regulatory ire, Mr. Houk, a former Fullbright scholar who boasts a law degree, an M.B.A. and a Ph.D., refuses to back down even at the risk of further scrutiny by the I.R.S. and sharp public criticism. ''The envelope needs pushing,'' he said.</p>
        <p>If that makes him something of a maverick, so be it. ''All progress is created, in my opinion, by skewed personalities,'' he said. ''The champion is not an average guy.''</p>
        <p>Quick to rely on biblical sources to support his views about paying volunteers, he claims the National Heritage Foundation has the potential to revolutionize churches, schools and other charities. But he is convinced that competing charities, the government and the media are conspiring to put an end to his efforts.</p>
        <p>Born in Dayton, Ohio, Mr. Houk, who is known as Dock, describes himself as coming from a wealthy background. He said his family was connected with the Mead Corporation, the giant paper company. He claims to have given nearly all of his inheritance to charities except for some property he kept for his wife and some small mutual fund accounts for his grandchildren.</p>
        <p>After graduating from Brown University, he spent a year in Finland on a Fullbright scholarship, where he earned an M.B.A. Later, he added two other advanced degrees before working for the government researching the impact of international aid.</p>
        <p>In 1968, dismayed by the government's actions to crack down on private charities, Mr. Houk created the National Heritage Foundation in anticipation of the 1969 Tax Reform Act, which took aim at perceived abuses by corporations and individuals whose charitable activities were said to be more for their benefit than that of others. ''I didn't like the 1969 tax act,'' Mr. Houk said. ''I thought it might cauterize charitable giving.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Houk was also busy on other fronts: creating what he claims was the first socially conscious mutual fund and teaching in the economic and business department of Liberty University, the college founded by the Rev. Jerry Falwell.</p>
        <p>By the early 1980's, the National Heritage Foundation was coming under increased scrutiny by the I.R.S., which can revoke a charity's tax-exempt status for some offenses. The service brought a case in 1982, alleging that the charity was really a group of private foundations, which would be subject to different requirements, and that it offered significant private benefit to financial planners who promoted it.</p>
        <p>Mr. Houk's organization, which by then had ousted him at the insistence of a big donor and had changed its name to National Foundation Inc., won the case in 1987.</p>
        <p>He got going again in 1994, forming a new group that he again called the National Heritage Foundation. It invoked many of the same principles about the evils of big government, attracting many powerful supporters. For instance, Bruce R. Hopkins, a prominent Kansas City charity lawyer, wrote the forward to Mr. Houk's book, ''The Coming Charitable Revolution,'' in which he lauded Mr. Houk's vision of a grassroots brand of philanthropy. That said, Mr. Hopkins said in an interview he never meant to provide Mr. Houk's organization with a blanket endorsement.</p>
        <p>There also remains significant enthusiasm for Mr. Houk's creativity at motivating people to give among people who work with donors.</p>
        <p>''The big issue is charitable entrepreneurship, and how far you can push that,'' said C. Dennis Brislawn, a trusts and estate lawyer in Kirkland, Wash., whose clients have set up foundations at National Heritage. ''Dock Houk is one of the champions to push the limits.''</p>
        <p>Besides getting a cut of the fees levied on donors' accounts, financial planners who generate a lot of business for National Heritage have also been rewarded occasionally by having foundations set up in their own names at National Heritage's expense. Planners may also use foundations to pay themselves for raising funds for charity.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Houk and his organization get out of all this is open for debate.</p>
        <p>In 1998, when people were enthusiastic about a plan to buy so-called split-dollar life insurance policies at his urging, National Heritage took in $128 million in revenue, its tax returns show. The split-dollar life insurance scheme, in which donors' gifts to a charity were used to buy life insurance policies naming both the charity and donors' heirs as beneficiaries, was outlawed last year, and Mr. Houk says National Heritage's revenues fell to about $61 million in 1999, information that is not yet available on the tax returns. Some donors who took his advice and bought split-dollar life insurance policies that have backfired are mulling lawsuits, although it is not clear that Mr. Houk would be the target of such actions.</p>
        <p>Even in a banner year like 1998, only $3 million was disbursed to outside charities, the tax returns show. Another $3 million covered other program expenses like honorariums and publicity, and nearly $60 million was used to buy insurance policies and other investment products used to build endowments. And information on how much donors are paying themselves cannot be gleaned from the tax returns.</p>
        <p>The charity's 1998 tax return makes no mention at all of Mr. Houk's own pay package and does not list Mr. Houk as one of its top officers, omissions that Mr. Houk acknowledged were an error, especially when the organization's letterhead refers to him as its executive director and chief executive officer.</p>
        <p>Mr. Houk says he makes about $6 an hour, roughly $12,000 a year or so,  in keeping with his sense that he does not need the money. He does, however, allow the organization to pick up some of his expenses, like frequent travel to the West Palm Beach area, where he maintains a modest office.</p>
        <p>Having installed his wife, son and daughter-in-law in top positions at National Heritage, he allowed them as a group to make about $166,000 in 1998 salaries, according to the tax returns.</p>
        <p>At an airport lounge in West Palm Beach last Friday, Mr. Houk said he did not understand why he was such a target for regulators, who he said were paying undue attention to him.</p>
        <p>''We're probably more socially responsible than the average bear,'' Mr. Houk said defiantly. He says he could easily spend his days playing tennis and enjoying life, but there is little sign of surrender. ''We're not going to quit fighting,'' Mr. Houk said.</p>
