        <p>FOR Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, a man with an intimate knowledge of war, there is a clear logic to his new assignment to persuade the Senate to reconsider a treaty ending underground nuclear tests.</p>
        <p>As a Polish child fleeing the Red Army in Warsaw in 1944, a teenage refugee in Berlin, a young Army major in Vietnam, the supreme commander of NATO forces in the early years of the Bosnian war and then chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the retired army general has seen war from nearly every possible vantage point.</p>
        <p>''War has never been something theoretical for me or my family,'' said General Shalikashvili, who commutes here from his retirement home on Puget Sound to act as the president's special adviser on the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which the Senate rejected last year.</p>
        <p>He even survived the stomach-dropping experience of discovering that his family's war experience was darker than he had realized. In 1993, while he awaited Senate confirmation for the top military job, historical documents were uncovered showing that his deceased father, Dmitri Shalikashvili, had served in a German army unit commanded by the Waffen SS.</p>
        <p>''To me, he was a kind and gentle man, and I loved him very much,'' the general told the Senate panel on the day of his confirmation hearing. ''I'm deeply saddened that my father had this tragic association.''</p>
        <p>A military man to the core, the general does not speak easily of things personal. When he retired as chairman in 1997, he and his wife moved to Steilacoom, Wash., south of Seattle, to a home with a clear view of the Olympic Mountains and, most important, close to their grown son, Brant, their only child.</p>
        <p>In his spartan office on the fifth floor of the State Department, he talks, instead, of the American soldiers he wants protected not only by state-of-the-art weapons and fighter jets, but by arms control as well.</p>
        <p>''It takes a combination of making sure we have the means of protecting ourselves with weapons and by diminishing the number of weapons out there that our soldiers have to confront,'' he said.</p>
        <p>When asked how his childhood, his Central European roots as well as his move to Peoria, Ill., at age 16, affects his support for arms control, he ducks the question with the gentle command: ''Don't make me sound schmaltzy.''</p>
        <p>What matters, he said, are his years as an officer and commander who actually had to prepare defenses against weapons of mass destruction and how he became convinced ''that we will be much better off with the test ban treaty than without it.''</p>
        <p>''I was the chairman through most of the negotiations,'' he explained. ''I undertook a separate, independent investigation, including careful discussions with laboratory directors. And I recommended to the president in 1996 that he should sign the treaty.''</p>
        <p>Ever since, the general noted, the military has supported the treaty banning underground nuclear testing.</p>
        <p>That seal of approval, though, was not enough to sway the Senate.</p>
        <p>In October, by a vote of 51 to 48, the Senate rejected the treaty that had taken decades to negotiate with more than 100 nations and was viewed as the single most important measure for halting the proliferation of nuclear weapons. If countries like North Korea and Iran continued testing, the senators reasoned, then the United States also had to be able to test its weapons.</p>
        <p>The United States was denounced from Berlin to Singapore for its ''arrogant'' defeat of that treaty.</p>
        <p>Now several conservative senators are going one better and trying to pull out of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.</p>
        <p>''I'm trying not to get entangled in that debate,'' the general said, ''but you can't talk in a vacuum.''</p>
        <p>So in the middle of the most heated arms control debate in recent memory, one tied to whether the United States will build a national missile defense system, the general is taking a soft-sell approach.</p>
        <p>He meets with senators in private, away from the limelight, to fulfill his mandate to persuade the Senate to approve the treaty sometime in the next administration, not in President Clinton's final months.</p>
        <p>''This way, people don't feel the same pressures of time or politics,'' he said. ''I tell them this is too important a treaty to be left languishing on the shelf.''</p>
        <p>Barely a month into his job, the general has talked to a dozen senators. While he will not discuss these private conversations, he said he had figured out the nature of the opposition.</p>
        <p>''There are senators who don't feel comfortable with any arms control treaties, and there are others who don't like this particular treaty,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Facing this new battlefield seems oddly familiar to him.</p>
        <p>''It doesn't feel much different from when I was chairman of the Joint Chiefs,'' he said. ''I had to go to the Senate for the budget, and for Rwanda, Bosnia, Haiti, Iraq and the Chemical Weapons Treaty.''</p>
        <p>THE subject matter -- the hard-nosed details of verification of nuclear stockpiles as well as the nuanced diplomatic consequences of trying to renegotiate the treaty -- is exactly what he had to juggle as NATO supreme commander, the first time he felt like a soldier-statesman.</p>
        <p>''Certainly with my background, knowing war in Europe, knowing the totality of Europe, I could easily understand Europeans and convince them why America wants certain things,'' said the general, relaxing his rule on personal reflection for a moment. ''And I felt European and American, the commonality of my experience.''</p>
        <p>Some of those European diplomats who became friends are now calling him to register their complaints about the Senate and its aversion to arms control treaties.</p>
        <p>He tells them what he tells the senators. ''As a military man, I can't accept the notion that arms control agreements don't have a place in our national security anymore.''</p>
