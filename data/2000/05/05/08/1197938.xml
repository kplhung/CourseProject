        <p>It will be eight stories tall, a huge contraption of steel and rocks and timber that will span a major highway in central Nebraska. The ribbon cutting for this unusual monument will be in July, and organizers are planning a grand affair with hordes of people, a mock buffalo stampede and, just possibly, but probably not, a speech by the president of the United States.</p>
        <p>In the seven-plus years of his presidency, President Clinton has been to Colorado and Wyoming. He has visited South Dakota and Iowa. Kansas and Missouri together have been hosts to the president a combined 20 times. But poor Nebraska is the lone state in the union that Mr. Clinton has snubbed.</p>
        <p>''The official reaction we've gotten from the White House is that the president's schedule has not been finalized and they'll get back to us,'' said Jeff Smith, an advertising executive from Omaha who is leading the uphill effort to lure Mr. Clinton to the dedication ceremony.</p>
        <p>''But we've got to be realistic,'' Mr. Smith added. ''Nebraska is not a heavily populated state, and it's not known as a Democratic swing vote in presidential elections. We'll probably have to book the governor.''</p>
        <p>There is less than 6,000 hours left in the Clinton presidency, a dwindling block of time that many people -- the organizers of the Great Platte River Road Archway Monument among them -- want to share. The monument commemorates a transcontinental route used after the Louisiana Purchase to open up the West.</p>
        <p>Putting together Mr. Clinton's schedule in these final months is a delicate balancing act that involves squeezing together fund-raising dinners, presidential speeches and photo opportunities with golf games, foreign trips and overnight stays in Chappaqua, N.Y.</p>
        <p>There are also weddings. Stephanie Streett, the woman who controls Mr. Clinton's day as assistant to the president and director of presidential scheduling, was married on Saturday in Fayetteville, Ark., and was able to pencil in her wedding on Mr. Clinton's schedule. It conveniently coincided with a fund-raiser in Little Rock, Ark., today for Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign in New York for a Senate seat.</p>
        <p>Virtually every minute of the president's day is scripted, from his first meeting of the morning (usually around 9) until what the official schedule calls ''good night.''</p>
        <p>Of course, most of what occurs in the White House revolves around politics, last week's education tour to Iowa, Ohio, Minnesota and Kentucky included. In his political role, Mr. Clinton has five Democratic National Committee fund-raisers on his schedule through June and several benefits for congressional candidates. Other appearances will be added around those five occasions, whether they are ''message events'' on a topic, or, if a fund-raiser is in California, a side trip to visit his daughter, Chelsea, in Palo Alto.</p>
        <p>Some days can be a mishmash of disconnected events -- like last Tuesday's speech to insurance agents, which was followed by a conference on raising teenagers and a talk to a roomful of experts on Latin America.</p>
        <p>Five minutes of every day is set aside to brief Mr. Clinton on the schedule. Time is also reserved daily for briefings by John D. Podesta, the chief of staff, and Samuel R. Berger, the national security adviser. There is also a bit of wiggle room to respond to the day's news.</p>
        <p>In White House lingo, aides refer to ''toppers'' as brief asides that the president makes at the top of a speech on an important news development. But reacting to breaking news can be risky.</p>
        <p>On Feb. 29, when Mr. Clinton heard about one 6-year-old shooting another in Michigan, he mentioned it at a fund-raiser in West Palm Beach, Fla., but flubbed the facts about how the youngster got the gun.</p>
        <p>Then there are ''departure statements,'' remarks Mr. Clinton makes as he is heading to somewhere else.</p>
        <p>''I am on my way to North Carolina for another leg of our New Markets tour to close the digital divide,'' Mr. Clinton said at one event. ''But before I leave I want to say a few words about an important study that Senator Daschle, Congressman Gephardt and I have just been briefed on regarding the growing cost of prescription drugs and the burden these costs are placing on seniors and on disabled Americans.'' He was referring to Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota and Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton's influence may be diminishing, but his aides say invitations from childhood friends, political allies and others continue to flow into the White House at a rate of about 250 a week.</p>
        <p>''I said, 'I know how busy you are so please try to come,' '' said George Frazier, an insurance agent from Hope, Ark., who made his pitch on Mr. Clinton's private fax line. ''I said, 'We've invited you each year for seven years, and this is your last chance.' ''</p>
        <p>Mr. Frazier, who has known Mr. Clinton since the president was a teenager, invited him to a meeting of insurance agents in Washington last week. But the chances looked grim at first because Mr. Clinton had been scheduled to visit France while the insurance agents were convening.</p>
        <p>When the trip to Europe fell through, the insurance group received a tip from a White House official, prompting the association to renew its lobbying effort. Eventually, the trade group received the good news from a presidential aide, days before its opening session. ''You got him,'' the aide said. ''You got him for half an hour.''</p>
        <p>But the timing was not ideal. The aide asked if the group would switch its meeting to the evening because the president dislikes early morning events. That was impossible, so Mr. Clinton showed up about 8:30 a.m. His scheduled half-hour appearance stretched on almost two hours.</p>
        <p>There are other idiosyncrasies that come with scheduling Mr. Clinton. He likes one day off a week. He routinely runs late. And he insists upon regular ''O.T.R.'s,'' which is off-the-record time during trips. These visits, which could be a golf game or a stop at a local restaurant, are not announced ahead of time but are far from spontaneous. Secret Service agents inspect the fairways, or the restaurant kitchen, well before his motorcade pulls up.</p>
        <p>''We set up the schedule to match his personality,'' said an official who has helped arrange the president's days. ''He hates superficial, two-second conversations. He doesn't like late nights or early mornings. He likes events with real people who are doing things that are relevant.''</p>
        <p>Democrats in Nebraska consider themselves in that category, and Mr. Clinton has hinted that, along with trips to the Middle East, Vietnam, Northern Ireland and Africa, he would like to accept Nebraska's invitation before Jan. 20, 2001, arrives.</p>
        <p>''It's a standing invitation,'' said Anne Boyle, chairwoman of the Nebraska Democratic Party. ''It's been delivered by letter, more than one letter, and by Nebraskans who have visited the White House.''</p>
        <p>Mrs. Boyle is not upset that Nebraska has yet to appear on Mr. Clinton's schedule. ''Sometimes when a president visits a state it's because of a natural disaster,'' she said. ''If you look at it that way, we're lucky.''</p>
        <p>Correction:  May 10, 2000, Wednesday  An article on Monday about communities that invite visits from President Clinton misidentified the Arkansas town where Mr. Clinton attended a wedding on Saturday. It was Subiaco, not Fayetteville.</p>
