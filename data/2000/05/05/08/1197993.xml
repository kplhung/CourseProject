        <p>Akos Hargitai, a dancer from Budapest, and Michaela Pein, a dancer from Vienna, run an organization called Cie. 2 in 1. They recently got together with three American choreographers for ''New York, Budapest, Vienna: Dialogues and Dances,'' a well-planned program of duets presented last Monday night.</p>
        <p>The choreographers concerned themselves with ways in which people manage to get along. They also emphasized the physical contrasts between Mr. Hargitai, who is dark-haired and solidly built, and Ms. Pein, redheaded and mercurial.</p>

        <p>Cie. 2 in 1</p>
        <p>Dance Theater Workshop</p>
        <p>Akos Hargitai, a dancer from Budapest, and Michaela Pein, a dancer from Vienna, run an organization called Cie. 2 in 1. They recently got together with three American choreographers for ''New York, Budapest, Vienna: Dialogues and Dances,'' a well-planned program of duets presented last Monday night.</p>
        <p>The choreographers concerned themselves with ways in which people manage to get along. They also emphasized the physical contrasts between Mr. Hargitai, who is dark-haired and solidly built, and Ms. Pein, redheaded and mercurial.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hargitai was impassive, while Ms. Pein kept darting nimbly through much of Vicky Shick's ''Napok es Evek (Days and Years).'' To the accompaniment of recorded snippets of jaunty waltz tunes by Kostas Kouris, they occasionally also reversed roles, tilting a table at various angles to indicate changing states of looseness and rigidity.</p>
        <p>JoAnna Mendl Shaw's ''Possession'' sent Ms. Pein and Mr. Hargitai running dizzily in circles to chirping and chiming sounds by Paul Dresher. Neither dancer ever managed to hold the other for long.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hargitai looked lost in thought while Ms. Pein was an elusive, but bewitching, vision in Alan Good's ''Extra Normal Dog,'' to recordings by the Max Nagl Quartet and Blindman's Kwartet.</p>
        <p>In their collaboratively devised ''Tango of a Faune,'' Ms. Pein and Mr. Hargitai danced wildly to a tango by Astor Piazzolla. As they did, video images of them in a similar emotionally intense duet appeared on a screen, providing spectators with a double dose of choreographic passion.</p>
        <p>This intelligent program whetted curiosity and made one want to see these dancers again, both in works by others and in more choreography of their own.</p>
