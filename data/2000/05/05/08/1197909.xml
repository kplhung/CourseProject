        <p>Pick up the remote control in most households and the odds are that one of a half-dozen companies decided which channels are available. For years, squeezing a new network onto the limited available lineup meant cutting deals with Tele-Communications Inc. (now part of AT&amp;T), Time Warner and a handful of other conglomerates.</p>
        <p>The giants' power was displayed in its raw form last week when Time Warner cut off Disney's ABC network from its systems for a day and a half. While that dispute was largely over the financial terms of a cable deal, Disney said it was also concerned that Time Warner, once merged with America Online, would take a similar gatekeeping role in an ever-expanding array of media.</p>
        <p>Between them, in fact, America Online and Time Warner already control 13 million cable households and more than 20 million Internet accounts. And together they are in a strong position to influence the evolution of high-speed Internet access over cable, interactive television and possibly the digital distribution of music as well.</p>
        <p>''This is one of the first major battles in which the parties are talking about what the rules of the road will be in the digital future,'' said Blair Levin, a former Federal Communications Commission official. ''Broadcasting is heavily regulated, but the government has a hands-off approach to the Internet. We don't know which will apply to interactive television.''</p>
        <p>But it is not so clear that the AOL-Time Warner distribution networks would always give it the upper hand. The limits on channels that restrict traditional cable systems do not affect the digital world. Moreover, the creators of popular programming have a more direct relationship with consumers than the cable networks or Internet providers.</p>
        <p>Look only at the outrage vented at Time Warner by its customers, as well as regulators and lawmakers, when the public could not find out who wanted to be a millionaire. With ABC disconnected for one day, some 25,000 people took up Disney's offer of a free dish to get satellite television, the death star that haunts cable's future.</p>
        <p>As with any negotiation between producer and supplier, there is high-stakes jockeying between television networks and the cable systems. Cable companies have been able to rebuff broadcasters' demands for cash payments for the right to use the signals of the major over-the-air networks. But the cable systems have agreed to carry new cable channels started by the broadcast networks, and to pay the customary fees for any cable-only programming.</p>
        <p>These negotiations have given the broadcast networks an edge at the moment that programmers are most vulnerable to cable systems: when they are starting a network. Once programming becomes popular, it is the networks that have the upper hand. ESPN, Disney's sports network, for example, has regularly been able to force cable operators to pay more to cover its rising costs for the broadcast rights to sports events.</p>
        <p>America Online and Time Warner, in fact, acknowledged this balancing act in the post-merger organizational structure they announced last week. They separated units that create music, movies, television programs and books from those that distribute programming on cable, on broadcast television and over the Internet. This is meant to encourage the company's Home Box Office network, for example, to buy movies from all studios, and its Warner Brothers film division to sell the movies it produces to all networks.</p>
        <p>The coming years will see battles like this multiply along with the numbers of new communications platforms.</p>
        <p>Before its deal with Time Warner, America Online complained that the cable systems were blocking it from offering high-speed Internet access over cable wires. AT&amp;T had granted exclusive rights to Excite@Home and Time Warner had made a similar deal with Road Runner, which it controls. Since the merger agreement, both sides have given ground. And the cable operators seem to have agreed to allow multiple high-speed services to coexist on their systems. But the cable companies say the arrangements should be subject to commercial negotiations, not regulations that would force them to carry all high-speed services.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless, many people argue that the trend of modern technology is away from closed systems to more open models. Perhaps the extreme case is the technology that allows people to copy and download music over the Internet, zooming past such details as copyrights and royalties.</p>
        <p>''The Internet is like the 1960's writ large,'' said Gerald M. Levin, Time Warner's chairman, who will be chief executive of AOL Time Warner. ''It is deconstructing everything that existed because of a zone of power and reconstructing things based on democratic principles.''</p>
        <p>Perhaps the biggest battleground in the struggle for control of digital programming will be interactive television. Cable and satellite systems are beginning to replace their set-top boxes with new devices using digital technology. At first these will simply allow more television channels and a fast Internet connection. Later, the boxes will allow interactive services like chat, e-mail and online shopping to be superimposed over television pictures.</p>
        <p>But those systems raise thorny questions. Who, for example, has the right to run the chat room next to Monday Night Football -- ABC or the cable system that provided the set-top box? And the stakes rise when it comes to a remote-control button for ordering the goods advertised in commercials, because the owner of the button could receive a fee for every sale. The cable companies argue that interactive television is no different from new channels and that they have the right to decide what services are offered on their systems. The networks say these services are extensions of their existing programs and should be carried by the cable systems with no additional payment.</p>
        <p>Such a fight has already erupted over a system that creates an on-screen program guide available on some new television sets. Gemstar Development, which created the service, transmits the program information in an unused part of the signals of some television stations. Time Warner's cable systems have blocked the Gemstar signal, demanding separate payment for access. Gemstar has sued Time Warner, saying it has no right to separate the data from the rest of the broadcast signals.</p>
        <p>It is certainly not clear how the courts or the marketplace will decide these fights. But there is no doubt that the distribution networks and the programmers will be engaged in many such battles.</p>
        <p>''In the old model, it was easy to know what everybody did,'' said Saul Shapiro, chief executive of Gist, a company developing interactive TV services. ''The networks ran programs and inserted ads. And no one messed with that. In the future, there will be a multiplicity of voices.''</p>
