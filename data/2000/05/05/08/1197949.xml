        <p>The molten sun beat down mercilessly. The hot, slow afternoon was a furnace. The parks lay green and motionless. Pavements shimmered like burning lakes. It might have been one of those torrid days in August when the heavy iridescent air presses down on the spirit and all seems hopeless.</p>
        <p>But the heat wave that smothered the metropolitan region and the mid-Atlantic states yesterday was no illusion. Normally in the high 60's in early May, the temperature hit 93 degrees in Central Park just after 3 p.m., breaking a record of 92 set in 1939, when the World's Fair opened in New York and war in Europe began.</p>

        <p>The molten sun beat down mercilessly. The hot, slow afternoon was a furnace. The parks lay green and motionless. Pavements shimmered like burning lakes. It might have been one of those torrid days in August when the heavy iridescent air presses down on the spirit and all seems hopeless.</p>
        <p>But the heat wave that smothered the metropolitan region and the mid-Atlantic states yesterday was no illusion. Normally in the high 60's in early May, the temperature hit 93 degrees in Central Park just after 3 p.m., breaking a record of 92 set in 1939, when the World's Fair opened in New York and war in Europe began.</p>
        <p>Other records from New England to Virginia were also shattered. It was 94 degrees in Newark and Concord, N.H.; 93 in Salisbury, Md.; 92 in Atlantic City; 89 in Burlington, Vt.; and 87 in Bridgeport, Conn. -- all records. And it was 90 in Boston, Philadelphia and Washington, although those were not record highs. Meteorologists said the region's heat-humidity index was in the mid-90's.</p>
        <p>The unusual spring heat -- a huge, humid air mass from the Midwest that was expected to linger until Wednesday -- felled about 40 people with dehydration and exhaustion on a five-borough bicycle tour of New York, while 40,000 other cyclists survived the 42-mile ordeal by pausing along the way to gulp gallons of water and get doused by kindly strangers with garden hoses.</p>
        <p>Emergency medical service workers treated those stricken by the heat and said no one was hospitalized. No deaths or serious injuries were reported in the region, but the heat depleted many of the well-conditioned runners in the men's Olympic marathon trials in Pittsburgh, with only one American qualifying for the Summer Games in Sydney, Australia.</p>
        <p>Aside from the Saharan heat, it was a lovely day in New York. Castles of clouds drifted in a liquid blue sky that seemed to go with tinkling chimes on a country porch. On Broadway, greengrocers set out pyramids of limes, oranges and apples. Down at the Battery, sea gulls dipped and soared, pencil lines in a musical composition, and the harbor rippled like blue-gray silk.</p>
        <p>While millions kept to the air-conditioned comfort of homes or sought relief in refrigerated theaters, shady parks, beaches or country retreats, there were many who challenged the day in shorts, tank tops and sunglasses, getting out to roller-blade, jog, stroll or just sit in the sun with the Sunday papers.</p>
        <p>''I'm used to this, but it's too darned hot,'' Bruce Anderson, 41, a native of Mobile, Ala., said as he and his newspaper wilted on a bench on West Street by the Hudson. ''This weather makes you not want to do anything,'' he added. ''I'm going home and take a nap.''</p>
        <p>At the White Horse Tavern on nearby West 11th Street, Anna Meyer, who had come from upstate New York for the Bike New York Tour, breezed in with a sweaty exhilaration and joined the crowd. ''It was a great day, perfect weather for riding,'' she said. ''Now I deserve a couple of beers and a burger.''</p>
        <p>Thousands of Brooklynites flocked to Prospect Park, and despite the heat some danced lavishly to the beat of 20 musicians on congas and steel drums. Yaffa Chapman, 33, of East New York, shook her hips in a colorful African skirt and beamed. ''Me not dancing in the summer is like man keeping nature from blossoming,'' she said.</p>
        <p>Her friend, Guy Isa Love-Zion Proud Nubian Messiah, also known as Guy Perry Hargett, whispered encouragement and rejoiced over the steamy summerlike day. ''Occasionally, the heat makes you think of ancient times,'' he said. ''It leads you to put your foot down anew with a little ancient African boogie.''</p>
        <p>For Juce St. Victor, 28, it was a day to go fishing. He combed the shore of Prospect Park Lake with his sons, Jamel, 9, and Jiovanni, 3, and a red cart carrying fishing rods and a boom box to play Bob Marley. ''The heat doesn't bother us,'' he said. ''We get fresh air in the park.''</p>
        <p>While most of the region sweltered, there were cool breezes off the ocean on the south shore of Long Island. Elana Sessler, of Atlantic Beach, ran errands, played tennis and was still going at midafternoon. ''I went for a bicycle ride on the boardwalk,'' she said. ''That was glorious.''</p>
        <p>Christopher Petrosino, 7, of Island Park, cooled off with a hockey lesson at Long Beach Arena while his parents watched.</p>
        <p>''It's much better in there,'' his father, Ralph, said as they came out blinking in the sunlight. ''It's got to be 35 to 40 degrees. There's a nice humidity haze. It works for me, if I can get two hours in air-conditioning.''</p>
        <p>Artificial cool was also on the mind of Lyle Tick, 24, an account executive for a Manhattan advertising agency, who spent the morning buying and installing a new air-conditioner. ''I suffered last summer with no air-conditioning,'' he said, ''so at the first sign of heat I went out and got one.''</p>
        <p>Why was it so hot in early May?</p>
        <p>Paul Knight, a meteorologist at Pennsylvania State University, had an idea. It had to do with the dry, mild weather last summer and winter in the Rockies and the northern Plains states; it left the ground from Montana through the Dakotas, Minnesota and the Great Lakes states very dry. That is the region where most of the weather reaching New York and the East comes from.</p>
