        <p>It  has a clunky name  ''nonfiction narrative'' or, if you like, ''narrative nonfiction.'' What is it? It is factual writing that reads like a good novel. It happens in books, in magazines and occasionally in newspapers, or at least it used to.

        <p>On Saturday there was a daylong conference here devoted to the state of narrative nonfiction.

        <p>It  has a clunky name  ''nonfiction narrative'' or, if you like, ''narrative nonfiction.'' What is it? It is factual writing that reads like a good novel. It happens in books, in magazines and occasionally in newspapers, or at least it used to. ''Dispatches,'' ''A Bright and Shining Lie,'' ''The Soul of a New Machine,'' ''In Cold Blood,'' ''Into Thin Air'' and ''The Professor and the Madman'' are a few fine examples.</p>
        <p>On Saturday there was a daylong conference here devoted to the state of narrative nonfiction. First, though, the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and the Neiman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University gave out three awards in the genre: two in memory of J. Anthony Lukas, the author of ''Common Ground,'' who died in 1997, and one in memory of Mark Lynton, a senior executive at Hunter Douglas in the Netherlands, who died the same year and whose family has financed the prizes.</p>
        <p>The J. Anthony Lukas Book Prize ($10,000) went to Witold Rybczynski, an architect and professor of urbanism at the University of Pennsylvania, for his book ''A Clearing in the Distance: Frederick Law Olmsted and America in the 19th Century.'' The Mark Lynton History Prize ($10,000) went to John W. Dower, a professor of Japanese history at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, for his book ''Embracing Defeat: Japan in the Wake of World War II.'' The J. Anthony Lukas Work-in-Progress Award ($45,000), for authors who have run out of money before finishing their books, went to James Tobin, who is working on a biography of the Wright brothers.</p>
        <p>The morning panel, moderated by Alan Brinkley, a professor of history at Columbia University, was given over to the prizewinners talking about the future of their art. The three men were pretty sanguine. The one thing that seemed to weigh on their minds was the boundary between fiction and nonfiction. Should it be there? Is it arbitrary?</p>
        <p>Mr. Tobin said great fiction is generally a notch above great nonfiction. But occasionally a nonfiction book like ''Common Ground'' or ''Rising Tide'' rises to the level of fiction. The best nonfiction books are not just about school busing in Boston or a flood in the Mississippi Delta, Mr. Tobin said. They are about ''what it means to be human in these circumstances,'' just like good fiction. But despite the similarities, Mr. Tobin said, the fence between fiction and nonfiction should remain. When he learned that the end of Truman Capote's ''In Cold Blood'' was made up, he said, ''I felt let down.'' Why? ''There is something about knowing that these events took place.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Rybczynski is no champion of the boundary. He agreed that people can feel deceived by nonfiction. But, he said, they can also feel deceived by fiction in which real people masquerade as characters. He thinks the term nonfiction, which he guessed dates to the 19th century, may be itself fictitious. The idea that nonfiction is different because it is true, he said, is absurd: If nonfiction were true, there would be one biography for one life, and it would be updated as new facts came to light.</p>
        <p>There is no one truth, Mr. Dower said, any more than there is a single Japan. A writer of history relies on sources who may or may not remember things accurately. And in the end, he said, the way that people actually remember an event, whether they are right or not, can be as important as the facts themselves.</p>
        <p>The panel of journalists in the afternoon, moderated by Robert Vare, who teaches at the Neiman Foundation at Harvard, was considerably less sanguine. The participants suggested that while this may be the golden age of narrative nonfiction for books, it is not the case with magazines and newspapers. The general-interest magazines that once published long nonfiction articles are now looking more like newsweeklies, and the newsweeklies are looking more like newspapers. Everyone wants stories faster, cheaper, shorter and timelier.</p>
        <p>Alma Guillermoprieto, who writes for The New Yorker and is the author of ''The Heart That Bleeds'' and ''Samba,'' said she despaired of poorer countries like Mexico and Brazil ever having the money to support journalists who want to write articles that require weeks or months of research. Out of some 18 million people in Mexico City, she said, there are fewer than 200,000 newspaper readers. The United States is lucky. It has readers who have money to buy papers and editors who have money to spend on reporters.</p>
        <p>Jack Hart, the editor of The Oregonian, which just won a Pulitzer Prize for a report about the journey of 20 pounds of potatoes from the farm to a box of McDonald's french fries in Singapore, talked about American newsrooms, past and present. He talked about Damon Runyon, Ernie Pyle, Ernest Hemingway, Walt Whitman and Mark Twain: reporters who were writers. The 19th-century newspaper was full of voices and stories. So why do editors give you a blank look if you talk about denouement? Why do they demand that everything be told in the first paragraph?</p>
        <p>The other journalists offered him some answers. Michael Kelly, the editor of The Atlantic Monthly and the author of ''Martyr's Day,'' a book on Saddam Hussein, blames the camera. In the 19th century, correspondents had to describe what a battle or a volcanic eruption looked like, he said. Now most editors find dispatches from the front pointless or anachronistic. They've got the picture, they figure; why do they need a description? When A. J. Liebling described Gov. Earl Long of Louisiana cooling his face with a handkerchief dipped in Coca Cola, young reporters were hanging on his every word, hoping to write like him one day, Mr. Kelly said. Now our literary farm system is destroyed.</p>
        <p>Walter Kirn, a book critic and the author of ''Thumbsucker'' and ''She Needed Me,'' said the appetite for narrative nonfiction was there, but was being satisfied ''synthetically.'' He thinks he knows what this nonfiction junk food is, he said: it is the ''spurious supernarrative,'' about people like O. J. Simpson or Monica Lewinsky or Elian Gonzalez, with characters and plots that everyone knows but no individual authors. The supernarratives are covered by packs of journalists.</p>
        <p>Editors are now seeing the folly of their ways and learning that there are some things that reporters do better that anyone else, Mr. Kirn said, which is to tell a true story that no one knows. If you want to call it narrative nonfiction, go ahead.</p>
