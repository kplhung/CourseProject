        <p>Dennis Hayes knows how to make money -- and how to lose it as well.</p>
        <p>Credited with inventing the computer modem in 1978 as a 29-year-old engineer working out of his kitchen, Mr. Hayes built the company he started to manufacture the devices, Hayes Microcomputer Products, into an industry powerhouse in the 1980's. But the company failed to adapt as lower-cost competitors eroded its market share, and after years of struggle, it finally shut its doors last year.</p>
        <p>Now, after quietly serving as a consultant for Internet companies and heading an Internet industry association, Mr. Hayes recently re-emerged, this time as chief executive of a new e-commerce unit of the online retailing company International Brands. The company, called the World Best Buy, has a Web site selling discounted merchandise like clothing and electronics as well as used items through an electronic garage sale format that matches buyers with sellers. It recently added an auction service and plans additional services soon, though Mr. Hayes would not go into details.</p>
        <p>The site has $40 million in prepaid ads, Mr. Hayes said, and interest among other advertisers, particularly in the automotive business, is high. The site has a section dedicated to cars and car parts.</p>
        <p>The story of Hayes Microcomputer, which introduced the Hayes-compatible PC modem in 1981, remains a cautionary tale of the computer industry. The company reached a peak of $250 million in annual sales before seeking bankruptcy protection for the first time in 1994, after failing to react quickly enough to competition to its principal product and the rise of powerful new competitors like 3Com and U.S. Robotics. Mr. Hayes resisted takeover bids for several years, but finally merged with Access Beyond in 1997, and ceded control.</p>
        <p>In the first half of 1998, the company lost $17.6 million and filed for bankruptcy again in October. In January 1999, the Hayes Corporation, as it was then known, shut down for good, ending a chapter in PC history.</p>
        <p>''It was a disappointment,'' Mr. Hayes said, adding that he lost $150 million in the bankruptcy. ''So I started doing what I know best,'' he said, ''helping companies grow fast.''</p>
        <p>Besides consulting, Mr. Hayes has spent the last few years as chairman of the United States Internet Industry Association, a trade group that has focused, among other things, on promoting the Internet as a tax-free zone.</p>

        <p>COMPRESSED DATA  Correction:  May 11, 2000, Thursday  An article in Business Day on Monday about a new electronic commerce business led by Dennis Hayes cited his pioneering technology work incorrectly. Although Mr. Hayes developed the modem that became the standard for personal computers in 1978, the first devices that enabled computers to communicate over telephone lines were developed in the late 1950's.</p>
