        <p>The latest numbers offered a stunning contradiction: a 3.9 percent unemployment rate, the lowest in 30 years, and two major national polls showing Gov. George W. Bush of Texas leading Vice President Al Gore by 5 percentage points.</p>
        <p>To put that contrast in perspective, the last time a president's party lost the White House in good times was 1920. And even then, the country was recovering from the double-digit inflation of World War I.</p>
        <p>So why isn't the booming economy blowing Mr. Bush away? Have the rules changed?</p>
        <p>Perhaps.</p>
        <p>First, the economy has stayed strong so long that most people are not worrying about it. Peter D. Hart, a Democratic pollster, said, ''It doesn't sit there as a major worry that people talk about.'' Robert Teeter, a Republican pollster who collaborates with Mr. Hart on the NBC News/ Wall Street Journal poll, said one reason for Bush support among older people was that ''only about 6 percent of the old people have economic worries.''</p>
        <p>Second, Mr. Gore does not get credit for the way things are. Polls show the public gives it to President Clinton and Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board.</p>
        <p>That may be reasonable enough, but Mr. Gore's own weakness as a candidate compounds that problem. After all, Mr. Gore is campaigning on a promise to keep the same economic policies Mr. Clinton has followed, while Mr. Bush's central campaign message is that he wants a very big tax cut.</p>
        <p>But the NBC/Journal poll showed that only 27 percent of voters thought Mr. Gore was very likely or fairly likely to pursue policies that would keep the economy strong, compared to 32 percent who said that of Mr. Bush. (Both of them enjoyed less credence than they did in December, when 36 percent had confidence in Mr. Gore and 43 percent in Mr. Bush.)</p>
        <p>The NBC/Journal poll had Mr. Bush ahead, 46 percent to 41 percent. A Gallup Poll for CNN and USA Today had the Bush lead at 49 to 44. Both polls were taken the last weekend of April, and the margin of sampling error for the NBC/Journal survey was plus or minus three percentage points, one less than for the Gallup Poll.</p>
        <p>Mr. Gore has simply not capitalized on winning his party's nomination more easily than Mr. Bush won his or achieving quickly the party unity and support from Bill Bradley that Mr. Bush is still seeking from Senator John McCain.</p>
        <p>Mr. Teeter said the data in the NBC/Journal poll explained it. ''Gore is not a very good candidate,'' he said. ''He is not a very likable candidate.'' Mr. Teeter argued that Mr. Gore's frequent attacks on Mr. Bush ran the risk ''of looking like the guy who is out of his time,'' out of step with an optimistic country.</p>
        <p>Though Mr. Teeter agreed that a strong economy was a major factor in retaining a president or his party, he said the most ''likable'' candidate had won most postwar elections. The clearest exception was 1968, when a losing war, civic turmoil and rising inflation helped Richard M. Nixon edge out Hubert H. Humphrey. In 1976, Mr. Teeter said, both Jimmy Carter and President Gerald Ford seemed likable.</p>
        <p>Still, these are early days. When the nomination contests ended in March, public interest in the campaign plummeted, and surveys by the Vanishing Voter project of the Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University show that knowledge about the candidates has also declined.</p>
        <p>There is no question that the Gore message in the summer and fall will emphasize continuity and accuse Mr. Bush of risking prosperity for a needless tax cut. Comparisons with the last Republican administration are inevitable, but will have special bite because the phrase ''Bush recession'' will surely be used.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hart, while conceding Mr. Gore's weak standing, cited a focus group he conducted last Tuesday in a Philadelphia suburb as offering hope for Mr. Gore. Everyone in the group of 12, whether he or she favored Mr. Bush or Mr. Gore, ''wanted the same policies,'' he said. ''They didn't want to tinker with the economy.''</p>
        <p>''Al Gore is sitting on a gusher,'' Mr. Hart said, if he can find a way to identify himself with the voters' desire for continuity.</p>
        <p>The best evidence that it is not too late for Mr. Gore comes from a New York Times/CBS News Poll taken in May 1988. That was the last time a vice president ran to succeed a popular president in an economic boom. Gov. Michael S. Dukakis led Vice President George Bush, 49 percent to 39 percent. It did not last.</p>
