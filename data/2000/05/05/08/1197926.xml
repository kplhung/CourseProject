        <p>After all the chaos of the last two years, Representative Merrill Cook of Utah left the Republican state party convention today still unsure how the turbulent past might affect his quest this year to win a third term in Congress.</p>
        <p>A series of unpleasant incidents, including public temper tantrums, staff disputes and a trial in which a jury determined he owed a former campaign consultant almost $200,000, made him one of the country's most vulnerable House Republicans, in the view of Democrats, who need a net gain of six seats to regain the majority they lost six years ago.</p>
        <p>And he might still be.</p>
        <p>Through two rounds of balloting that eliminated only one of two challengers, he failed to win the 60 percent of delegate votes he needed to secure the party nomination without a primary as he had two years ago. Instead, he faces a June 27 runoff against Derek Smith, an energetic political novice whose strong showing was bolstered by support from a surprising source, another Utah congressman, Representative Christopher B. Cannon. It is widely known in Utah that Mr. Cannon and Mr. Cook are not especially fond of each other. Mr. Cannon, who lent the challenger some of his staff for the campaign, nominated Mr. Smith at the convention.</p>
        <p>After a first round in which Mr. Cook won 45 percent of the vote to 31 percent for Mr. Smith, a business owner, and 23 percent for Jeff Wright, a venture capitalist, Mr. Cook's margin narrowed in the second round, with 53 percent to 46 percent for Mr. Smith.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cannon and Utah's other representative, James V. Hansen, advanced straight to the general election. Mr. Cannon, who represents eastern Utah, won 78 percent of the vote in a bid for a third term. Mr. Hansen, who represents the western side, was unopposed at the convention in seeking an 11th term.</p>
        <p>Mr. Cook pronounced himself satisfied with the outcome, insisting that advancement to a primary, as opposed to elimination, vindicated him and showed that delegates from his district, the greater Salt Lake City area, appreciated his work in Washington, if not his well-publicized troubles.</p>
        <p>Still, it was not the unequivocal coronation he had sought from delegates who let no opportunity pass without reminding most incumbents that they should take nothing for granted, especially if they had shown any moderate tendencies. Even though Senator Orrin G. Hatch surpassed 60 percent to avoid a primary in his efforts to win a fifth term, he was greeted with a healthy mix of boos and jeers upon introductions.</p>
        <p>So was Gov. Michael O. Leavitt, who is running for a third term against three challengers and failed to reach 60 percent in any of three ballots, putting him in a primary for the first time since 1992. He will face another political newcomer, Glen Davis, a businessman.</p>
        <p>''It's unconscionable, for all they have given to the party,'' Dan Jones, a Republican pollster and consultant, said of the booing. ''I'm surprised. But it shows there is a real schism in the Republican Party. The far right is alive and well. Moderates are frustrated how to respond.''</p>
        <p>Utah is one of the most Republican states. Every major office but one, state attorney general, is held by a Republican, and that office could change because Attorney General Jan Graham, a Democrat, is not seeking re-election.</p>
        <p>But in Utah, there are Republicans and there are Republicans. And when one makes an exception to unfettered gun ownership rights, for example, as Mr. Leavitt did in pushing a measure that failed but would have prevented people from carrying concealed weapons into a church or school he loses support. For that, many delegates opposed to Mr. Leavitt branded him ''a liberal.''</p>
        <p>''These conventions are the political version of hazing,'' Mr. Leavitt said. ''You have to expect it as a two-term incumbent.''</p>
        <p>Critics of Mr. Hatch, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, were no more charitable. They passed out literature accusing him of being soft on gun rights by favoring a three-day waiting period for background checks at weekend gun shows as part of last year's juvenile justice legislation even though the National Rifle Association, which opposes checks that take so long, has endorsed him.</p>
        <p>In Mr. Cook's case, the concerns reflected not so much his record as his controversies, which left him nervous and confused before the voting. At a candidates' forum on Friday night, he conceded he could win ''anywhere from 15 percent of the vote to 75 percent.''</p>
        <p>Calmer after the balloting, he said  he was not disappointed at all, even with the prospect of a contentious primary and charges by Smith supporters that he was no longer electable. ''I always felt this was the toughest part, the convention phase,'' Mr. Cook said.</p>
        <p>Even if he wins the primary, Mr. Cook will have his hands full with his Democratic opponent, Jim Matheson, the son of a popular former Utah governor, Scott M. Matheson, who was nominated today at the more serene Democratic convention.</p>
        <p>The Democrats also nominated Bill Orton, a former congressman, to run for governor; Scott Howell, the state senate minority leader, to oppose Mr. Hatch; Kathleen McConkie Collinwood to oppose Mr. Hansen; and Donald Dunn, a former White House staffer, to face Mr. Cannon.</p>
