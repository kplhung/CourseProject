        <p>IN the world of advertising, the big budget commercials with brand name directors and fancy special effects usually go to products like automobiles, soft drinks and sneakers. Think Nike. Think Pepsi. Think Ford.</p>
        <p>Now Unilever -- a company known for its household and personal care products -- is jumping into the fray with a multimillion-dollar extravaganza for a shampoo line.</p>
        <p>The British-Dutch conglomerate is staking millions in production costs and more than $40 million in media buys to promote the two-year-old ThermaSilk shampoo, conditioner and hair care line. The campaign goes on the air on network television beginning today.</p>
        <p>The campaign follows a successful introduction for ThermaSilk, which achieved more than $120 million in sales in its first year on the market. The benchmark for a successful product line is about $100 million in sales. Unilever says the brand was a major reason the company was able to overtake Procter &amp; Gamble's longtime leadership in the $3.7 billion hair care market.</p>
        <p>Created by J. Walter Thompson USA, the three new commercials are lush, dreamlike settings of mythical places: in each one, a princesslike woman tames a dragon or beast, and in so doing also transforms her hair into beautiful locks. To create the lush spots, Thompson used some 90 special effects and animation experts, and employed a digital artist on the set.</p>
        <p>The fantastical settings tap into the popularity of fantasy and magic, as witnessed by books like the Harry Potter series; in TV shows like ''Charmed'' and ''Queen of Swords''; and even in the newest women's fashions, which have a ''princesslike prettiness'' about them, said Cathy Lennox, management director for ThermaSilk at Thompson.</p>
        <p>But the settings also dramatize an insight into the 25-  to 39-year-old female audience the company is trying to reach: that each morning women undergo a transformation when blow-drying their hair, Ms. Lennox said.</p>
        <p>''A lot of advertising in this category talks at women; it's not emotionally based,'' Ms. Lennox said of the campaign's approach. ''We found heat-styling is an emotionally charged time, when a woman is transformed. Another reason the campaign resonates with women is that it recognizes the appeal of fantasy to escape the emotional world.''</p>
        <p>The commercials cost several million dollars to produce, said Andrew Gross, hair care category director for Unilever Home and Personal Care USA. The average national 30-second spot costs $295,000 to produce, according to the American Association of Advertising Agencies in New York, a trade group.</p>
        <p>In one spot, a young woman is lost in a forest in medieval times and comes upon a huge fire-breathing dragon, which she embraces, rather than fears; his flames make her hair gorgeous. That spot, shot in a subtropical jungle in Mexico, required a flamethrower to light the trees in the woods.</p>
        <p>In another spot, a snake-haired Medusa is seen in a celestial ballroom amid other figures from Greek mythology. To the delight of the crowd, she dances the tango with another creature and her viper-filled tresses are transformed into beautiful hair. An 80-piece orchestra performed the tango from an original score.</p>
        <p>The campaign was directed by Bruno Aveillan, known in France for his Perrier and Galeries Lafayette commercials. Even though Thompson used American-style special effects, the creative directors in charge at Thompson -- Chris D'Rozario and Ed Evangelista -- wanted the campaign to have a low-key, European sensibility.</p>
        <p>''We didn't want a Hollywood feel, which is more obvious and very packaged and canned,'' said Mr. D'Rozario. ''The Europeans have a more artistic sensibility. With Bruno, each frame looks like a painting.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Evangelista believes the less commercial feel of European-style advertising is beginning to catch on here. ''The Europeans are less literal and give the consumer more credit, and we're starting to see more of that here,'' he said.</p>
        <p>For Unilever, what is significant about the campaign is that it is based on the brand's main attribute, that its formula works with heat to improve the hair, Mr. Gross said. Hence the campaign's slogan: ''Heat is beautiful.''</p>
        <p>''What intrigued us about the idea is that it linked with the brand proposition, which is taking heat from bad to good in a dramatic way,'' Mr. Gross said.</p>
        <p>ThermaSilk's success, paired with a restaging of Unilever's Suave brand, helped increase Unilever's market share last year to 23.9 percent of the $3.7 billion overall hair care market, edging out P.&amp; G., which had a 22.5 percent share, according to the A. C. Nielsen Company, which tracks product sales in supermarkets, drugstores and other outlets. This is the first time Unilever has led in the category, Mr. Gross said.</p>
        <p>ThermaSilk fits in with the trend in the industry toward premium brands with product benefits beyond smelling nice, said Wendy Nicholson, a personal care analyst with Salomon Smith Barney in New York. ThermaSilk retails for about $3.50 a bottle, a price that is roughly 20 percent more than an average shampoo.</p>
        <p>''Consumers are more concerned about using products that are good for them and have more therapeutic benefits,'' Ms. Nicholson said. ''No one is using the basic, just-smell-good stuff anymore; consumers are willing to pay more for perceived product benefits.''</p>
        <p>Still, Ms. Nicholson noted that while P.&amp; G.'s market share has eroded a bit, it remained the leader last year in the $2.7 billion market that includes shampoo and conditioner only. P.&amp; G. had a 27 percent share last year compared with Unilever's 20 percent, according to Information Resources Inc., which tracks sales of packaged goods. P.&amp; G.'s Pantene is the market leader, with a 14 percent share. ThermaSilk has a 5 percent market share and is ranked fourth, Ms. Nicholson said. The market is highly competitive, with dozens of new products introduced every year.</p>
        <p>And P.&amp; G. isn't standing still. Just this year it introduced Physique, a premium styling line with formulas that are promoted as helping women to get and keep their hairstyles. It's a complete line of products from shampoo to gels, priced at about $7 each. P.&amp; G. is aggressively promoting Physique, which Ms. Nicholson said is designed to reinvigorate P.&amp; G.'s hair care business.</p>
