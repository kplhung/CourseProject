        <p>For the $4 million he spent to buy Fusaichi Pegasus as a yearling, Fusao Sekiguchi of Tokyo is reaping racing's richest rewards. His horse has won five straight races in four months, and he won the Kentucky Derby with an awesome display of speed and power on Saturday while conquering one of the strongest fields in Derby history. He also broke the jinx that for 20 years has kept the favorite from reaching the winner's circle.</p>
        <p>But most of all, Fusaichi Pegasus has endowed the sport of thoroughbred racing with the thing it needs most: great expectations.</p>
        <p>The last three colts to win the Derby -- Silver Charm, Real Quiet and Charismatic -- went on to win the Preakness. But, on the edge of sweeping the Triple Crown, they lost the Belmont Stakes. Still, they brought huge crowds to Churchill Downs, Pimlico and Belmont Park to see if racing would unveil its 12th Triple Crown winner, and the first since Affirmed in 1978 to sweep all three classics.</p>
        <p>Fusaichi Pegasus is one-third of the way there, and rarely has a Derby winner looked so imposing. Perhaps not since Secretariat in 1973 has any horse so captured the public's fancy. ''This is a very talented horse,'' said his English trainer, Neil Drysdale, still speaking conservatively from his pulpit outside Barn 41 at Churchill Downs on the morning after the Derby. ''And he looks like he's got a very bright future in front of him. So, it was very rewarding to watch the talent come through, and for him to show that talent.''</p>
        <p>The jockeys and trainers who tried to outrun Drysdale's star were less restrained. They sounded as though they had lost to sheer brilliance on the racetrack, to an animal who lived up to his name, Pegasus, the flying horse of mythology.</p>
        <p>With one-quarter of a mile to go, Richard Migliore thought he was riding a winner with Wheelaway, who had been first in the Tampa Bay Derby but on Saturday finished fifth. ''The winner,'' Migliore testified, ''might be a great horse.''</p>
        <p>With an eighth of a mile to go, John Velazquez thought he had beaten the favorite with his mount, More Than Ready. But he finished fourth, and Velazquez put it succinctly: ''The winner went by me, and I knew I couldn't catch him.''</p>
        <p>D. Wayne Lukas, who trained the Derby winner three times in the last six years, tried to outrun Fusaichi Pegasus with three horses, but they finished up the track: Exchange Rate (12th), High Yield (15th), Commendable (17th). Lukas, the only trainer with purse winnings of $200 million, got nothing for his labors in his 20th straight Kentucky Derby. ''I was impressed with Fusaichi Pegasus,'' he said. ''All the fears about him were put to rest when he went over there, and he did what he had to do.''</p>
        <p>What Fusaichi Pegasus had to do was win with command, something that racing likes to remember in great horses and longs to see again. He has regal breeding (son of Mr. Prospector, grandson of Danzig), he has high spirits that were kept under control in the Derby, he has horse sense -- he switches inside or outside, he flows with the traffic, he closes with breathtaking drama.</p>
        <p>So, for his investment of $4 million, Sekiguchi has bought himself a bundle of success, a mighty horse who is delivering the kind of theater that racing has been searching for. And his investment certainly looks more promising than the $60 million spent so far by the National Thoroughbred Racing Association on its cosmetic changes, its ''commissioner'' and his six vice presidents, the television time they buy to increase public awareness of racing and the cable television station they have established to send the message.</p>
        <p>But they are sending a narrow message. They are serving the hard-core bettors and handicappers who gamble on the product but don't necessarily define it in terms of remarkable animals bred and trained to race. The racing association is charged with marketing the business of racing. But it is traveling the low road, trying to drum up people's interest in commercial solutions like simulcasting and home betting.</p>
        <p>Poetry can't pay the bills, that's true. But when you have a product as classic as Fusaichi Pegasus, with a compelling story line and rivals like 88-year-old Harold Rose and Jenine Sahadi and the young Todd Pletcher with his four horses and Lukas with his three and Sheik Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum with his pair -- why try to manufacture drama when it's already there?</p>
        <p>How can you beat the flying horse winning the Kentucky Derby and reviving the great expectations of a sport that desperately needs them?</p>
