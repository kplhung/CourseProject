        <p>After several failed attempts to complete a deal, the WPP Group, the British advertising conglomerate, is near to an agreement to acquire its New York-based rival, Young &amp; Rubicam Inc., for about $5.5 billion, according to executives close to the talks.</p>
        <p>The deal, which could be announced as early as this week, according to the executives, would be  the largest advertising agency company merger in history, and it would create the largest advertising company in the world, measured by revenue.

        <p>After several failed attempts to complete a deal, the WPP Group, the British advertising conglomerate, is near to an agreement to acquire its New York-based rival, Young &amp; Rubicam Inc., for about $5.5 billion, according to executives close to the talks.</p>
        <p>The deal, which could be announced as early as this week, according to the executives, would be  the largest advertising agency company merger in history, and it would create the largest advertising company in the world, measured by revenue. Ford, Kraft Foods, Mattel and Sears, Roebuck are among the clients of the two companies.</p>
        <p>According to executives involved in the negotiations, Young &amp; Rubicam has effectively ended simultaneous talks with a second suitor, Publicis S.A. of France, because it favored doing a deal with WPP.</p>
        <p>One executive close to the talks said that Y.&amp; R. could reignite talks with Publicis at any point and referred to those negotiations as ''simply stalled.'' And a deal between WPP and Young &amp; Rubicam is still not a sure thing. Talks between the two companies have failed twice before after last-minute maneuvers by both sides. The last time they failed, the two companies were on the verge of signing merger documents.</p>
        <p>However, this time, the talks are expected to end in agreement because both sides have compromised on sticking points that derailed their previous efforts.</p>
        <p>In the most prominent example, Young &amp; Rubicam had insisted on remaining autonomous during its first year under the umbrella of  WPP, which also owns Ogilvy &amp; Mather Worldwide, J. Walter Thompson and the public relations agency Hill &amp; Knowlton. Y.&amp; R. has dropped that demand and will settle for a committee that will include two executives from each company who will handled the integration of the two companies during the first year.</p>
        <p>Mike Dolan, who is currently Y.&amp; R.'s financial director, will become its chief executive, according to executives close to the talks.</p>
