        <p>The concert of Sir John Tavener's music at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola on Thursday night included minisermons from the composer. He spoke about the power of Jesus, about the ''metaphysical subtext'' of his own music and about summoning the divine imagination to go ''beyond the realm of our contemporary scientific mass-genocidal world.'' That same mixture of humility and grandeur informs his compositions. Nearly every piece on the program was an elegy or a prayer; the music quietly contemplated death, then turned triumphal as it invoked resurrection.</p>
        <p>Sir John's music has a neomedieval aura. He reaches back to the modality of Renaissance music and outward to non-Western music, particularly the sound of liturgical music from the Russian Orthodox Church, which he has joined. Along with such mystical minimalists as Arvo Part, he stands aside from Europe's last 400 years, as if seeking purity through asceticism. The music rejects the bustle and compromises of everyday life; it's a pristine sanctuary.</p>

        <p>The concert of Sir John Tavener's music at the Church of St. Ignatius Loyola on Thursday night included minisermons from the composer. He spoke about the power of Jesus, about the ''metaphysical subtext'' of his own music and about summoning the divine imagination to go ''beyond the realm of our contemporary scientific mass-genocidal world.'' That same mixture of humility and grandeur informs his compositions. Nearly every piece on the program was an elegy or a prayer; the music quietly contemplated death, then turned triumphal as it invoked resurrection.</p>
        <p>Sir John's music has a neomedieval aura. He reaches back to the modality of Renaissance music and outward to non-Western music, particularly the sound of liturgical music from the Russian Orthodox Church, which he has joined. Along with such mystical minimalists as Arvo Part, he stands aside from Europe's last 400 years, as if seeking purity through asceticism. The music rejects the bustle and compromises of everyday life; it's a pristine sanctuary.</p>
        <p>The program was performed by the Tallis Scholars, a vocal ensemble directed by Peter Phillips that usually sings Renaissance music. Using a minimum of vibrato on Sir John's stately legato phrases, they sustained the music's otherworldly calm.</p>
        <p>At its best Sir John's music projects simplicity without turning simplistic. ''Song for Athene,'' which was sung at the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, set out what could almost be a cozy Anglican hymn, then moved through modernist dissonances before resounding organ chords proclaimed an entrance into paradise. ''In the Month of Athyr'' sets a poem by C. P. Cavafy, musing over a worn, ancient tombstone. The chorus sings the few words -- ''tears,'' ''grief'' -- that can be read in clear parallel lines over a drone, while a narrator describes the scene. On Thursday night the somber narrator was Sir Paul McCartney, who drew some Beatles fans to the sold-out concert.</p>
        <p>Many of the pieces on the program were modeled after antiphonal church music, with a chantlike solo voice answered by choral polyphony in which Sir John takes modern liberties. Some chorales had austere modal harmonies; in others, independent lines wandered toward impassive dissonance. Occasionally women's voices floated upward in chromatic harmonies out of Debussy, like sirens in a Hollywood epic.</p>
        <p>''Lament of the Mother of God'' generated drama with an elementary strategy: as Mary poured out her grief, the key moved upward with every verse. Patricia Rozario sang the demanding part with sorrowful concentration. She was also the soloist in ''A New Beginning,'' commissioned for Britain's Year 2000 celebration. The music ended gently after the inevitable trumpets and drums.</p>
        <p>When the Flux String Quartet performed ''The Hidden Treasure,'' a lengthy, episodic piece based on earnest cello melodies (with some Slavic inflections) and ghostly high chords, the music grew threadbare. It needed text, not subtext. But tied to human voices, Alleluias and words about death and transcendence, Sir John's music was filled with serene reverence.</p>
