        <p>It has been 11 years since Alex Martin was born, a 1-pound 2-ounce bundle of miniature bones and bright red skin, with fingers no bigger than matchsticks and legs so thin they might have fit inside his father's wedding band. His parents, Rick and Allison, waited four months to send birth announcements. ''The doctors kept telling us we had to plan for his funeral,'' Mrs. Martin explained.</p>
        <p>Today, Alex is a blond-haired, fair-skinned fifth grader with clear brown eyes, gold-rimmed glasses and a collection of what his mother calls labels: mild cerebral palsy, asthma, hyperactivity and Asperger's syndrome, a form of autism. At an age when most children have conquered fractions, Alex wrestles with addition. He learned to read about a year ago and is racing through the Hardy Boys series. But speaking is a challenge; words roll around like marbles in his mouth.</p>
        <p>Alex cannot ride a bike. He still wears sneakers that fasten with Velcro, because his fingers cannot master the intricacies of laces. Often, he retreats into a private fantasy world. A recent weekday afternoon found Alex sitting cross-legged in the backyard of his family's home in Raleigh, N.C., spinning stories to an audience of no one as he smashed rocks against the dirt. ''Life,'' Mrs. Martin says, ''is overwhelming for him.''</p>
        <p>It is also overwhelming, at times, for his parents, who are discovering firsthand what scientists are beginning to document about babies born as tiny as Alex: their lives often grow more complicated over time. Long after their worries about simply keeping Alex alive have faded, the Martins are faced with new and no less daunting concerns, from whether their son will ever be able to make change at the grocery store, or drive a car or maintain a job, to who will care for him after they die.</p>
        <p>It has been more than 20 years since doctors began saving extremely premature infants, and about a decade since advances in neonatology vastly improved the survival of babies of very low birth weight -- those weighing less than 1,500 grams, or 3 pounds 4 ounces. The tiniest of these babies -- micropreemies, they are called -- are born as much as 14 weeks early and weigh less than 750 grams, or 1 pound 10 ounces.</p>
        <p>For the first time, thousands of such children are now well into their school years. The conventional medical wisdom, based on previous studies, had been that those like Alex, who are not seriously physically disabled, would catch up to other youngsters by age 5. And many do just fine. But as the first large group of tiny babies grows up, new research is showing that academic and behavioral problems often surface in the school years.</p>
        <p>Researchers had previously had no way of knowing for sure what the long-range effects of complications like bleeding in the brain might be. And they are only now beginning to get a clear picture.</p>
        <p>''We used to say if they got to 2 or 3 and they were doing fine, they'd be O.K.,'' said Dr. Deborah E. Campbell, director of the division of neonatology at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. ''Now we know that is not necessarily true.''</p>
        <p>In one recent study of 150 teenagers who weighed 2 pounds or less at birth, nearly one-third had significant physical disorders, including cerebral palsy, blindness and deafness. Nearly half were receiving special education assistance, compared with 10 percent in a control group. But the study, which appeared in February in the journal Pediatrics, also found that even those children with minor physical problems scored significantly lower on achievement tests than those in the control group.</p>
        <p>''We can save tiny babies now, which we weren't able to save before, but with the technology there is a price,'' said the study's author, Dr. Saroj Saigal, a neonatologist at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. Dr. Saigal said she had been flooded with letters, many with the same message: ''Behind the success, as this child is called by the medical profession, there are lots of problems.''</p>
        <p>The vast leaps in survival of extremely premature infants came with the widespread use of a synthetic form of surfactant, a chemical that helps babies' lungs absorb oxygen. Before surfactant, about one-quarter of the smallest babies survived; today, about one-half will live.</p>
        <p>Babies of very low birth weight make up only a tiny fraction of all newborns. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, of the 3.9 million infants born in the United States in 1998, 1.4 percent, or about 56,000, were considered in this category. Of these, 16,647 were micropreemies.</p>
        <p>It is difficult for doctors to know if low-birth-weight babies born today will fare any better than those born a decade ago. But Dr. Maureen Hack, a neonatologist at Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, who has followed premature infants as they grow, says she suspects the outcomes will be much the same.</p>
        <p>Dr. Hack said a recent study of infants born weighing less than 1,000 grams found slightly higher rates of cerebral palsy and slightly lower intelligence quotients than in those of the same weight born in earlier decades. ''Even though survival has improved, how the children are doing later has at best stayed the same,'' she said. ''You are replacing death with impairment.''</p>
        <p>There is no thornier decision in medicine than the decision to rescue a tiny baby. It is expensive, costing as much as $2,000 a day, and wrenching for doctors and parents. Studies like Dr. Hack's and Dr. Saigal's are intensifying the long-running debate about the ethics of using sophisticated technology to save children with uncertain futures.</p>
        <p>For parents, the questions are hardly academic. They feel lucky that their children are alive, although in quiet moments some will confess that they wonder if they made the right choice.</p>
        <p>''Every day I count my blessings,'' said Raquel Bolden of Cleveland, whose 8-year-old daughter, Mischa, was one of Dr. Hack's patients. Mischa, who weighed a little more than 2 pounds at birth, has mild cerebral palsy and severe hearing loss.</p>
        <p>Like most hospitals with neonatal intensive care units, Rainbow Babies and Children's has a follow-up clinic for premature babies, and Mischa was seen there. But as is typical, the tracking at Rainbow stops at age 3. After that, medical and educational professionals lump disabled premature children with the estimated six million disabled youngsters in the United States.</p>
        <p>When Mischa was younger, Mrs. Bolden said, she worried about her daughter's physical condition. Hoping to improve Mischa's strength, she signed her up for gymnastics and ice skating. ''Now,'' she said, ''I'm more worried mentally.''</p>
        <p>In the first grade, Mischa is having trouble with math. Mrs. Bolden, who until recently was a single mother, working and going to school full time, is considering a tutor, though she is not certain how to pay for one. Mischa has trouble filtering out background noise, and Mrs. Bolden said she had fought with school officials to pay for hearing-aid amplifiers.</p>
        <p>''I read a few preemie books when she was little,'' Mrs. Bolden said, ''but there is no manual when they get older.''</p>
        <p>Decisions about rescuing children like Mischa at birth play out every day in neonatal intensive care units. The one at Montefiore Medical Center, like all such wards, is a place of dreams and heartache.</p>
        <p>Everything is in miniature. Tiny creatures, their eyes protected by dark patches, their fragile bodies connected to a maze of tubes, sleep in plastic cases, many under the glow of violet lights to cure jaundice. Diapers and pacifiers look as though they were made for dolls. Feedings are measured in half teaspoons.</p>
        <p>As director of this unit, Dr. Campbell faces the delicate task of answering the questions of new parents who inevitably want to know what the future will bring.</p>
        <p>''You want to give hope, you want to encourage them,'' Dr. Campbell said, ''but you've got to keep everybody reasoned.''</p>
        <p>Some advocates for parents of premature children say that if doctors were more forthright, parents might make different choices about whether to rescue their babies.</p>
        <p>''Parents are very rarely told about the long-term, so-called minor disabilities,'' said Helen Harrison, author of ''The Premature Baby Book'' (St. Martin's Press, 1983), a guidebook for parents. ''These minor disabilities, of course, can keep children from living independently, or ever having a social life or being able to function in society.''</p>
        <p>Doctors say they do routinely hold discussions with parents on whether to withhold care. But they also say that making predictions is difficult. How well premature infants fare depends on their birth weight -- every extra ounce improves their chances -- and on whether they suffer any serious complications. It also depends on socioeconomics.</p>
        <p>The Reyes family is a case in point. Jacqueline Reyes is a single mother of two boys who lives in the Soundview section of the Bronx. Her 8-year-old son, Duron, is healthy. But her 5-year-old, Dominic, born weighing a little more than a pound, has severe cerebral palsy. He still wears diapers and cannot sit by himself.</p>
        <p>On a recent morning, Ms. Reyes took Dominic to the Children's Evaluation and Rehabilitation Center at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, where doctors are evaluating the boy to get him into kindergarten. As a child with disabilities, Dominic was entitled by federal law to attend preschool at taxpayer expense. But his mother was unaware of the law, and so he never went.</p>
        <p>Dominic is also entitled to occupational and physical therapy, and Ms. Reyes said therapists did visit him at home for a time, but stopped coming a couple of years ago. Now the doctors at Einstein are considering referring Dominic for surgery to correct a hip problem that the center's director, Dr. Herbert J. Cohen, said might not have developed had the boy's therapy continued.</p>
        <p>For Ms. Reyes, however, therapy and school are pushed to the back burner by the tasks of daily living like grocery shopping and doing the laundry. Until December, when she showed up at the Einstein center, she did not have a wheelchair for Dominic and simply carried him wherever she went. She lives on the second floor of an apartment building with no elevator and no ramp. When she goes out, she said, she takes her children to the bottom of the stairwell and sits Dominic in his older brother's lap while she runs back up for the chair.</p>
        <p>Dr. Cohen says the Reyes family is not unusual. Parents of disabled children, particularly the poor, often miss out on services for their children. Once, he said, his center had a program for following infants at high risk of disabilities. But it was disbanded two years ago after cuts in federal and state reimbursements. For children like Dominic, Dr. Cohen said, the future often depends ''on how good an advocate the parent is.''</p>
        <p>And even knowledgeable advocates face challenges, as the Martins can attest. Mr. Martin runs the National Computer Center for the federal Environmental Protection Agency and his wife is a former E.P.A. biologist. They have begun an Internet site to provide support for families like theirs: www.comeunity.com/premature</p>
        <p>When the Martins moved to North Carolina from the Washington area nearly two years ago, Alex scored below normal on an I.Q. test. Convinced the low score was the result of overmedication for his hyperactivity, the Martins hired a psychologist to repeat the exam; this time, the test scores were normal. Alex's special education teacher, Jan Valletta, said that without the Martins' backing, Alex would have been labeled mentally retarded.</p>
        <p>''People misjudge Alex,'' Mrs. Valletta said. ''They think from seeing him in the hall that he's retarded, or there's not much there. But Alex is really very intelligent; what makes him different is that he is intelligent, but he cannot communicate.''</p>
        <p>In the time that she has been teaching Alex, Mrs. Valletta says, she has seen vast improvement. She is trying to draw him out of his fantasy world and kindle his interest in science instead. Alex likes to write, but holding a pen is difficult, so he is getting instruction in typing on the computer. Learning to read has given him confidence, and his social skills are improving.</p>
        <p>In the school gym one recent morning, two girls from the regular fifth-grade class took pains to pick Alex when the physical education teacher told them to split up into teams. ''The girls,'' Mrs. Valletta said, ''are crazy about Alex.''</p>
        <p>To the Martins, these are encouraging signs. But if the past is any predictor of the future, they know there is uncertainty ahead.</p>
        <p>''What prematurity is about,'' Mrs. Martin said, ''is risk. And that risk never goes away.''</p>
