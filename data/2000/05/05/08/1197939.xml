        <p>Editorial says there is no way for consumers to judge validity of R J Reynolds Tobacco Co's claims that its new Eclipse cigarette may present less risk of cancer; says Congress should give Food and Drug Administration power to regulate this kind of sales pitch</p>

        <p>The R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company recently began test-marketing the new Eclipse cigarette with the claim that it may present less risk of cancer. The trouble is, there is no way for consumers to judge whether that bold claim is valid. For other food or drug products, this kind of claim would be subject to prior independent government scrutiny.

        <p>The R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company recently began test-marketing the new Eclipse cigarette with the claim that it may present less risk of cancer. The trouble is, there is no way for consumers to judge whether that bold claim is valid. For other food or drug products, this kind of claim would be subject to prior independent government scrutiny. Yet tobacco products, known to kill some 400,000 Americans a year, are exempt from regulation by the Food and Drug Administration. The Eclipse sales pitch shows the glaring need for Congress to give the F.D.A. power to regulate tobacco.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, the Federal Trade Commission, which has power to take action against misleading or deceptive advertising, should examine the claims about Eclipse cigarettes. But unlike the F.D.A., the F.T.C. does not pre-clear health claims before they reach consumers.</p>
        <p>R. J. Reynolds says its tests show that the smoke from Eclipse, a cigarette that heats rather than burns tobacco, contains lower levels of carcinogens and causes less inflammation in the respiratory system than smoke from conventional cigarettes. Eclipse, however, does not reduce and may even increase the risk of heart disease in some people, leaving it unclear whether it offers a net gain or loss to health. Whatever the case, any health claim concerning a deadly, addictive product should be subject to verification by government authorities before reaching the market.</p>
        <p>The pitch for Eclipse raises other troubling questions. The ads say that for smokers worried about their health, Eclipse is ''the next best choice'' to quitting. That message may offer just enough reassurance to lull some smokers into continuing when they might otherwise try to quit.</p>
        <p>Research has shown that the marketing of ''low tar'' cigarettes did not result in better health outcomes because smokers tended to smoke more or inhale more deeply on low-tar cigarettes. Even if Eclipse can be shown to be less toxic in laboratory tests, how it is marketed and how smokers use it will determine its impact on consumer health. As the tobacco industry begins to create and sell a new generation of products, strong federal regulation will be crucial.</p>
