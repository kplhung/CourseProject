        <p>INTERNET retailers spent the latter half of the 1990's trumpeting the differences between their business models and those of traditional retailers. Now that Wall Street is holding the e-tailers accountable and demanding signs of future profitability, Web merchants have shown a new respect for their bricks-and-mortar brethren.</p>
        <p>A case in point: e-commerce companies have turned to an old retailing standby, private-label manufacturing, to give them higher profit margins and better control of inventory. Items like dog food, cosmetics, diamonds, toys and golf clubs, to name a few, now wear dot-com labels, and more are joining every week.</p>
        <p>Online retail executives say that by manufacturing their own goods and selling them alongside well-known brands, they can hasten the slow march toward profits.</p>
        <p>Analysts generally agree, but caution that  several obstacles could slow or even stall the private-label effort online. And in an environment in which Web merchants have decreasing room for error, they are moving as gingerly as they can -- while maintaining Internet speed -- into this corner of the retailing realm.</p>
        <p>Among the latest companies to announce a private-label effort is Ashford.com, an online seller of jewelry, apparel and other goods. Late last month, the company rolled out the Ashford Collection, an assortment of jewelry manufactured exclusively for Ashford, and it will add similar lines of pens, scarves and leather goods in the coming months.</p>
        <p>Kenneth E. Kurtzman, the company's chief executive, said several factors were behind the move, but none more important than profit margin.</p>
        <p>''By purchasing directly from manufacturers, we can price 40 to 50 percent cheaper and still make 50 to 70 percent margins,'' he said. ''If we can generate 20 percent of our sales from private label, and have a 60 percent margin, while the other 80 percent of sales generates a 35 percent margin, that's a definite contributor to cash.''</p>
        <p>Another benefit of private-label manufacturing, Mr. Kurtzman said, is that his company ''can react to customer trends more quickly because the turnaround time is much shorter.'' For instance, he said, if a certain type of earring generates buzz among consumers, the company could have that earring in stock within six weeks, ''whereas with some of the brands, it'd take a year or more to see changes in the product lines.''</p>
        <p>Such goods are also less likely to collect dust in the warehouse, Mr. Kurtzman said. ''And with faster inventory turns, you have less cash tied up in your inventory,'' he added. ''Again, that helps you reach profitability more quickly.''</p>
        <p>Bruce Van Kleeck, vice president of the National Retail Federation, a trade group,  said selling by private label ''has been a very serious growth vehicle for many traditional bricks-and-mortar retailers in the past seven or eight years.''</p>
        <p>''It gives retailers greater control of sales and marketing,'' he said, because brand manufacturers often dictate the terms of pricing and advertising. ''And obviously, it's significantly more profitable.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Van Kleeck said dot-com companies faced a greater challenge in introducing private labels because online shoppers generally have a brand name in mind before they visit a specific Web site. Consumers may be more wary of unbranded goods like private label clothing that they have never seen, felt or tried on. ''The consumers who've bought into e-commerce have done so because they know the merchant or the product,'' Mr. Van Kleeck said.</p>
        <p>Getting consumers to try the product of a newly created company, he said, could require considerably more marketing. ''But getting people to turn away from traditional brands also takes time,'' Mr. Van Kleeck said. ''And in Internet time, who knows what that means.''</p>
        <p>In the case of Chipshot.com, one of the earliest proponents of online private-label retailing, the answer is two years. The company, which sells golfing merchandise, began manufacturing irons in 1998.</p>
        <p>The company's chief executive, Brian Sroub, said Chipshot generated a substantial portion of its revenues by selling its own brand. ''It's been the basis of our business,'' Mr. Sroub said. He added that the private-label approach ''allows us to offer superior quality at a lower price, and retain higher margins for ourselves.''</p>
        <p>For instance, with Chipshot irons, Mr. Sroub said, the company buys the grips, shafts and club heads from the same manufacturers that supply the traditional brands, so the quality is the same. But because Chipshot assembles the clubs when the orders are taken, it can customize the clubs to the customer's specifications and deliver them within a week -- a service that can take several weeks at offline retailers.</p>
        <p>Retailers of private-label merchandise must balance such benefits against potentially sizable pitfalls. Among them is the possibility that well-known manufacturers will refuse to sell them their goods if they sense that the retailer is competing too fiercely against them. Such so-called channel conflict can doom e-tailers that use the big brands to draw customers.</p>
        <p>Still, not all retail categories are so dependent on brands, and those that are not have generated some of the more aggressive private-label efforts on the Web.</p>
        <p>Nearly all of the sales of Furniture.com, for instance, are attributable to private-label brands. Andrew Brooks, the company's chief executive, said the site began carrying private-label goods in its early days partly because the brand-name manufacturers did not want to alienate their traditional retailer partners by selling through a Web merchant.</p>
        <p>But the company quickly learned that ''furniture buyers don't shop for brand,'' but for style, Mr. Brooks said. As a result, the Web site groups furniture into collections of similar styles, he said, an approach that yielded $20 million in sales during the last quarter.</p>
        <p>The paucity of well-known furniture brands is perhaps one reason another high-profile e-tailer, eToys, is rolling out its private-label effort with a collection of children's furnishings. Jane Saltzman, vice president for merchandising at eToys, said the company would begin selling 500 different products with the eToys brand this fall, and branch out to other categories besides furniture. ''We'll grow beyond that 500, but not to tens of thousands,'' she said. ''I see this as a complement to our assortment.''</p>
        <p>Indeed, Mr. Kurtzman, of Ashford.com, said: ''It's important to understand that this is about optimizing the balance between branded and private-label goods. It's not a panacea for an Internet retailer. It won't completely change the business model. But it's certainly something we all need to do to generate cash and achieve profitability more quickly. And the companies that don't do it will have a harder time getting to where they need to be.''</p>
