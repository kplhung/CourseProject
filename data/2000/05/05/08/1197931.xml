        <p>White House officials and Democrats in Congress say they have become concerned that negotiations on a bill to define patients' rights have stalled.</p>
        <p>President Clinton has summoned 10 members of Congress to the White House in an effort to galvanize talks on the issue, one of his party's top legislative priorities this year.</p>
        <p>Democrats do not accuse the Republicans of bad faith but say the negotiations have become enmeshed in a slow, frustrating process that seems to be leading nowhere. Each party says the other is responsible.</p>
        <p>Last year, the Senate and the House passed very different versions of the legislation, which would, for the first time, establish comprehensive federal standards for private health insurance, especially health maintenance organizations and other forms of managed care. For decades, insurance has been regulated mainly by the states.</p>
        <p>The negotiations are widely viewed here as a major test of the leadership abilities of Senator Don Nickles, the Oklahoma Republican who is chairman of the House-Senate conference committee.</p>
        <p>As assistant majority leader of the Senate, Mr. Nickles has repeatedly shown his ability to round up Republican votes. But never before has he faced such a public test of his ability to forge compromises with Democrats on complex issues with immense political overtones.</p>
        <p>Disappointed at the pace of negotiations, Mr. Clinton invited leading conferees from both parties to the meeting, tentatively set for Thursday. Chris Jennings, the president's health policy coordinator, said, ''We are very troubled by the delays.'' He said Mr. Clinton would urge the conferees to ''roll up their sleeves and get down to work.''</p>
        <p>In an interview, Senator Nickles said: ''I don't think the talks have stalled or bogged down, but they've moved back a little bit. We keep trying to move forward, but there's been two steps back by the Democrats. We closed some issues that the Democrats now say are still open. I hope to accelerate the pace.''</p>
        <p>Those expected to attend the meeting include Mr. Nickles, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Representative John D. Dingell, Democrat of Michigan.</p>
        <p>John D. Podesta, the White House chief of staff, and Donna E. Shalala, the secretary of health and human services, met on Wednesday with consumer advocates, doctors and others who back the administration's position. Afterward, the consumer advocates and health care professionals complained that Republicans were delaying the legislation.</p>
        <p>Senator Nickles said he did not appreciate the administration's efforts to pressure the conferees by mobilizing its allies.</p>
        <p>''We've been successful in keeping politics out of this for the last three or four months,'' Mr. Nickles said. ''But the Podesta meeting suggests that the administration is trying to politicize the process. That's not helpful. This process would be very easy to blow up.''</p>
        <p>On April 14, just before the spring recess, House and Senate negotiators said they had reached a tentative agreement on an appeals procedure that would allow patients to obtain an independent medical review of decisions by an H.M.O. to deny care or coverage. But lawmakers have been unable to translate that conceptual agreement into legislative language.</p>
        <p>Moreover, Mr. Kennedy said, the negotiators have not even begun to discuss the two biggest issues: Should patients have a new federal right to sue H.M.O.'s for injuries caused by substandard care? Should the protections of federal law apply to all Americans with private health insurance -- more than 160 million people -- or just to those in certain types of health plans now exempt from state regulation?</p>
        <p>President Clinton strongly prefers the House bill because it would cover more people and make it easier to sue.</p>
        <p>Republican and Democratic Congressional aides have been meeting several times a week to discuss compromises on other issues, like access to emergency care and to medical specialists. But Democrats said the negotiations had been hampered because they were not allowed to keep copies of the legislative language proposed by the Republicans.</p>
        <p>Distrust between the parties appears to be growing. Democrats said the Republicans were making a political calculation, trying to decide whether public concern about H.M.O.'s was deep enough to require Congressional action this year. For their part, Republicans resent the pressure from the White House.</p>
        <p>Joanne L. Hustead, director of public policy at the National Partnership for Women and Families, an advocacy group supporting the House bill, said Republicans were ''dragging their feet.'' And she added, ''I believe that the Senate leadership is not committed to getting a bill enacted into law.''</p>
        <p>Asked about this view, Senator Nickles said: ''That person doesn't know what they're talking about. We've been pushing very hard to get a bill that gives patients protection.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Clinton has often demanded that Congress pass ''a patient's bill of rights,'' but lawmakers say he may inadvertently have shifted public attention from that issue by giving more emphasis to another goal: expanding Medicare to cover prescription drugs for the elderly.</p>
        <p>John B. Crosby, executive director of the American Osteopathic Association, said doctors strongly supported the legislation to define patients' rights and make H.M.O.'s more accountable. But Mr. Crosby said, ''Medicare drug benefits have taken away a lot of attention from the patient's bill of rights.''</p>
        <p>Senator Nickles has opposed any expansion of patients' right to sue, saying the prospect of such lawsuits would lead to an increase in premiums and could cause employers to drop coverage for their workers.</p>
        <p>But his home state, Oklahoma, has just adopted a law making it easier for patients to sue H.M.O.'s and other insurers for the unreasonable denial of medical care. Under the law, a health plan can be required to pay damages if it fails to exercise ''ordinary care'' in treating patients.</p>
        <p>In an interview, the chief sponsor of the Oklahoma bill, State Senator Brad Henry, a Democrat, said: ''Senator Nickles is definitely out of step with the public here in Oklahoma. Polling information shows that 72 percent of Oklahomans support giving a patient the right to sue.''</p>
        <p>The Oklahoma measure, approved 94 to 5 in the State House of Representatives and 44 to 2 in the State Senate, was signed by Gov. Frank Keating on April 28.</p>
        <p>Karen M. Ignagni, president of the American Association of Health Plans, which represents H.M.O.'s, said: ''Just prior to the Congressional recess, members of the conference committee seemed to be making significant progress. But things are slowing down. I'm baffled how things could have changed so much in three short weeks.''</p>
