      <block class="full_text">
        <p>Even in the storied annals of New York City Housing Court, where landlords have tried to evict tenants for everything from barking dogs to unauthorized washing machines, the case against Dana Escoffier was novel.</p>
        <p>As Mr. Escoffier tells the tale, his landlord accused him of looking too young.</p>
        <p>Testifying about his case at a City Council hearing on rent regulation in February, Mr. Escoffier complained that he suddenly faced eviction proceedings after living for 28 years at 523 Hudson Street in Manhattan.</p>
        <p>The landlord's lawyer claimed that the tenant of record by now would be 69 years old, and since Mr. Escoffier looks nowhere near that age, he must be an impostor and should be thrown out. While he could pass for someone in his 40's, Mr. Escoffier said he is actually 55 and has no idea where the lawyer came up with 69. To avoid eviction, Mr. Escoffier went to court with a State Department of Motor Vehicles identification card, only to face new challenges to his lease.</p>
        <p>''It's about greed, about getting as much money as they can for the apartment,'' said Mr. Escoffier, who pays $443 a month for the small two-bedroom under rent stabilization regulations in the West Village. He figures that if he is evicted and the apartment is deregulated, the owner could quadruple the rent in today's turbocharged real estate market.</p>
        <p>One longtime tenant advocate who thought he had heard it all was struck by the too-young charge. Michael McKee, associate director of the New York State Tenants and Neighbors Coalition, said, ''It's the craziest thing I ever heard of.''</p>
        <p>Although trying to evict someone for looking too young is a peculiar argument, landlords are adopting increasingly aggressive tactics to oust tenants from valuable rent-regulated apartments.</p>
        <p>Real estate experts say the city's sizzling housing prices, coupled with the weakening of rent regulation laws in 1994 and 1997, have made it increasingly lucrative for owners to empty apartments with low rents, especially in Manhattan. Landlords, many of whom say they are being shortchanged by illegal subletting, often spend thousands of dollars per case for lawyers and even private detectives, but they can quickly recoup those costs in higher rent and in the building's resale value if they win.</p>
        <p>''The incentive to get tenants out by any means, legal or illegal, is tremendous,'' Mr. McKee said. ''If you get a vacancy, you've got a gold mine.''</p>
        <p>When a rent-stabilized apartment is vacated, an owner is allowed to charge the next occupant as much as 20 percent more. If renovations and other specified allowances add up to a monthly rent of more than $2,000, then the apartment is permanently deregulated. Deregulation -- the holy grail of the rental business -- means that the landlord can charge whatever the market will bear.</p>
        <p>''Some buildings are serving blanket notices to everyone terminating tenancy,'' Mr. McKee said. ''If just one person gets frightened and moves out, they're ahead.'' Tenants are often unaware that ''the landlord has to prove his case, and no one can be evicted without a court order.''</p>
        <p>Tenant lawyers say they are getting swamped with cases. Colleen McGuire, whose law firm was hired by Mr. Escoffier, said, ''There is a surge, almost an epidemic.''</p>
        <p>But owners say they are forced to protect their property from deceitful tenants who illegally sublet regulated apartments at great personal profit, cheating landlords of their rightful income.</p>
        <p>''There is a greater level of aggressiveness on the part of owners because so many people are living illegally in rent-stabilized units,'' said Joseph Strasburgh, president of the Rent Stabilization Association, the leading owners' group. ''In Manhattan, particularly, you have a large number, so thousands have been challenged purely on the basis that they don't live where they say they live. But to say that owners are just using this as harassment is unfair.''</p>
        <p>Soaring prices have raised the stakes and the abuses, both sides say.</p>
        <p>''Tenants themselves recognize this is a very hot real estate market,'' said Sherwin Belkin, a lawyer who represents owners. ''Like landlords, they're viewing apartments as having enhanced economic value. Tenants engage in deceptive activities, and that has the landlords digging a little deeper and pushing the envelope further, like a rubber band with each side tugging and pulling.</p>
        <p>''Ninety percent of sublet requests are absolutely deceptive,'' Mr. Belkin continued. ''They're actually moving somewhere else, putting someone else in the apartment and getting extravagant amounts of money but insist on the application that they intend to come back at the end of the sublet. It gives new meaning to insider trading.''</p>
        <p>The economic boom has reduced evictions for rent arrears, but the number of cases like Mr. Escoffier's has risen since 1994. That was when the City Council changed the law to deregulate any vacant rent-stabilized apartment if the monthly rent could be raised to $2,000 through renovations and other factors. The year before, owners filed 15,058 eviction cases. Filings jumped to 17,975 in 1994, and in the five years since they have averaged 22,200. Last year there were 22,781.</p>
        <p>''There's been a tremendous upsurge, akin to the mid-80's co-op boom,'' said Samuel J. Himmelstein, a tenant lawyer. ''My practice has virtually tripled since 1995.''</p>
        <p>Eviction litigation can be expensive for both sides, easily costing thousands of dollars. ''No one wants to pay attorney's fees for frivolous cases,'' said Mr. Strasburgh of the Rent Stabilization Association.</p>
        <p>Mr. Belkin said that the biggest cases involve the most valuable apartments, where ''the tenants are almost always represented by counsel.''</p>
        <p>But tenant advocates paint a discouraging picture, with most tenants facing eviction without a lawyer. ''I've had tenants crying that they can't afford a lawyer,'' Mr. Himmelstein said. ''For every one who can, there are three or four who can't.''</p>
        <p>He warns that contesting and losing a case makes tenants liable for legal fees for both sides and retroactive rent at market rates, which could add up to tens of thousands of dollars. ''I've had clients sit here and say, 'That would mean bankruptcy for me.' '' Some tenants simply give up and move out.</p>
        <p>Mr. Escoffier said that his building, a five-story brick walk-up with 18 apartments, once had a tenants' group that staged a rent strike to get bathrooms installed in the apartments, instead of shared ones in the hallways. ''But that has dwindled down, and now people are fighting their own battles.</p>
        <p>''I don't want to move. I can't move, can't afford it,'' said Mr. Escoffier, a nutritionist. His apartment is a narrow railroad flat with a fireplace, two small connected bedrooms, slanting floors and an enclosed toilet in one kitchen corner and a shower in another.</p>
        <p>After spending half his life there, Mr. Escoffier said, he was shocked when eviction papers were served last fall, and even more puzzled by the accusations. ''They kept saying I was too young to be 69,'' he recalled.  ''But I never said I was 69.'' In court, when he produced better records of his tenancy than the landlord did, Mr. Escoffier said, ''The judge said, 'He must be who he says he is.' ''</p>
        <p>But documentation of his age did not end the eviction case. There were five more rounds of court hearings, Mr. Escoffier said, and in each, the landlord's lawyers tried other arguments to get rid of him.</p>
        <p>One argument was that the original lease was signed by Mr. Escoffier's father, and that the son was not entitled to stay. Mr. Escoffier denied that, saying that he was married and had reared two children there, but that ''my father never lived here.''</p>
        <p>The owner's lawyer also contended that Mr. Escoffier really lived somewhere else and that the apartment was illegally occupied by a subtenant, described first as a young man who recently answered the door and later as an older man also seen on the premises. Mr. Escoffier said that he had business away from the building on the day of a scheduled repair and had his nephew there to let the superintendent in. And the older man was simply a brother visiting from Brooklyn, he said.</p>
        <p>''They're willing to try anything; they just want to get the apartment so they can charge more money,'' Mr. Escoffier said of the continuing court battle.</p>
        <p>The litigation is exhausting, he said. But he enjoys recounting some courtroom volleys, like his response to a claim that he had not been seen around the building. ''I said to the lawyer, 'Are you saying that since I was not seen I didn't exist?' I asked the lawyer, 'Do you believe in God?' He said, 'Yes.' I said, 'Have you ever seen God?' He said, 'No.' I said, 'Are you saying he doesn't exist?' The judge chuckled at that one.''</p>
        <p>The landlord's main lawyer, Thomas S. Fleishell, declined to be interviewed on the issues. ''Suffice it to say that Mr. Escoffier's conduct over the years has given reason to bring the proceeding,'' he said. The building's recorded owner, Hudson Street Equities Group, does not have a listed telephone number. The building managers, Time Equities, deferred to the lawyer.</p>
        <p>''I may be soft-spoken,'' Mr. Escoffier said, ''but I am a fighter and I stand my ground.'' He said he was especially motivated to defend his home. As a young man, before getting his life together and going to college, he lived for a while in Central Park. ''I was homeless before it became fashionable,'' he said, ''and I don't want to go back.''</p>
