        <p>When Professor C. P. Chou of Princeton University came to Beijing this March to renew the contract for his university's longstanding summer language program at Beijing Normal University, he was unprepared for the meeting that would ensue.</p>
        <p>Unbeknownst to him, a Chinese academic had recently published an essay attacking the program for ''infiltrating American ideology into Chinese language teaching,'' by using teaching materials that sometimes presented China in an unflattering light.</p>
        <p>And the nine-year-old program -- one of the most prestigious language courses in China -- was suddenly in jeopardy.</p>
        <p>''I was caught totally by surprise,'' said Professor Chou, the program's director, reached at his office in Princeton, N.J. ''A vice president told me there was something 'very serious' taking place and handed me a copy of the article. He said that both Beijing Normal University and my textbooks were under serious attack.''</p>
        <p>In response, the university demanded that Professor Chou delete eight essays entirely and modify large chunks of other lessons before a contract could be signed. Sections on how the growing use of e-mail promotes free speech and the hazards of walking through Beijing traffic had to dropped, for example.</p>
        <p>''I think it definitely has something to do with President Jiang's Three Stresses campaign,'' said Professor Chou, who is modifying the material and said the program would continue.</p>
        <p>The language program's troubles started when Chinese officials noticed the highly critical essay in the academic journal Beijing Social Science and demanded action. Officials at Beijing Normal told the Princeton professor that someone at a much higher level was ''in charge of this business, but it was all very opaque,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The partnership between Princeton and Beijing Normal had always had its tensions. Some Chinese instructors who teach in the program have long grumbled about the teaching materials, which have included essays about topics like drug use and freedom of speech in China, and urge students to debate sensitive issues including family planning and the independence of Taiwan.</p>
        <p>The books, ''touch on the Taiwan issue too often and contain unwitting or witting distortions and mis-readings of Chinese society and culture,'' wrote Yuan Hua, a teacher at Beijing Normal University, in the essay that led to the program's current woes.</p>
        <p>At the behest of Chinese authorities, the Princeton-based authors of the teaching materials have always had to adapt their textbook somewhat for use in China. But this year ''was much more unpleasant and specific,'' said Professor Chou. ''And the changes they wanted were extensive and not negotiable. It was basically a threat.''</p>
        <p>Professor Chou said he was particularly taken aback because some of the lessons criticized centered on newspaper articles he had reprinted from the People's Daily, the Communist Party mouthpiece -- and also because many of the topics deemed ''too sensitive'' by university authorities are now routinely raised in books and articles in China.</p>
        <p>In each case, the university authorities objected that the articles, or the related discussion questions, were politically sensitive or else just made China look bad. Segments describing the rude behavior of Chinese soccer fans and how Chinese drivers don't yield for pedestrians were both deemed unacceptable -- even though both problems are obvious and have been loudly decried in the Chinese press.</p>
        <p>In her article, Yuan Hua said Professor Chou had cleverly used articles from the People's Daily to somehow provoke anti-China sentiment. It is a charge that Professor Chou denies: ''To me, these books are just vehicles for teaching language. To them, the content is what we should teach and be concerned about.''</p>
