        <p>Tchaikovsky's ''Mozartiana'' is an orchestration of various pieces by Mozart, but George Balanchine's ballet of the same name could be called choreographic chamber music. Only 11 dancers are required, and all 11 appear together only in the finale.</p>
        <p>The New York City Ballet danced the ballet both on an exquisitely small scale and on a grand one Tuesday night. Kyra Nichols was the soloist in the opening, ''Preghiera.'' As her arms reached upward with serene joy, she appeared to be greeting a new day with a morning prayer. Her attendants in the scene were four remarkably poised students from the School of American Ballet: Jan Burkhard, Rachel Mallory, Abigail Simon and Isabel Vondermuhll.</p>

        <p>The New York City Ballet danced the ballet both on an exquisitely small scale and on a grand one Tuesday night. Kyra Nichols was the soloist in the opening, ''Preghiera.'' As her arms reached upward with serene joy, she appeared to be greeting a new day with a morning prayer. Her attendants in the scene were four remarkably poised students from the School of American Ballet: Jan Burkhard, Rachel Mallory, Abigail Simon and Isabel Vondermuhll.</p>
        <p>Tom Gold hopped with glee through a solo ''Gigue,'' making comically eccentric shapes in the air with his limbs as he did so. His frivolity gave way to a ''Menuet'' graciously danced by Dena Abergel, Mary Helen Bowers, Dana Hanson and Melissa Walter.</p>
        <p>Ms. Nichols was joined by Damian Woetzel in a long pas de deux, and their sense of ease helped give its demanding sequences of tiny intricate steps a jewel-like sparkle. When everyone assembled at the finale, this gathering had the charm of a garden party.</p>
        <p>In contrast, Jerome Robbins's ''Glass Pieces,'' to music by Philip Glass, evoked urban bustle. The precisely drilled dancers in its opening ensemble could have been pedestrians walking, and then leaping, through crowded streets. The concluding ensemble sent everyone racing. But the way Wendy Whelan and Philip Neal let their movements flow to seem one long unbroken phrase in the second movement suggested that even city folk can be tranquil.</p>
        <p>The orchestra played well under Hugo Fiorato and Maurice Kaplow, the evening's conductors. Because of injured dancers, Peter Martins's ''Stabat Mater'' was replaced by a repeat performance of Balanchine's ''Symphony in Three Movements.''</p>
