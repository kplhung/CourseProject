        <p>The pink roses with dashes of peach were popular on a sunny spring afternoon at the downtown farmers' market.</p>
        <p>But for anyone thinking in terms of dollars, what was more striking was the price for a dozen: 7.2 German marks, or $3.31. Not long ago, they would have cost almost $5.</p>
        <p>Fresh-cut flowers have long been a bargain here, but something else is at work now as well: The euro, Europe's fledgling single currency, has plunged 24 percent since its debut on Jan. 4, 1999.</p>
        <p>The euro was supposed to unify the economies of 11 European countries and be a symbol of stability to rival the dollar, the yen and even the British pound. The idea was to be a European champion just as Airbus aircraft took on Boeing.</p>
        <p>But so far it has been a boon to the very currencies with which it was supposed to compete. Now Americans brandishing dollars or Britons spending pounds are finding bargains from Amsterdam to Vienna.</p>
        <p>On Friday, in an extraordinary statement for a central banker, the president of the European Central Bank, who is to the euro what Alan Greenspan is to the dollar, all but apologized for its descent, saying it could ''undermine the perception of the euro as a stable currency.''</p>
        <p>He and and another top official hinted, for the first time, that the bank might reverse its policy and try to raise the value of the euro by going into currency markets and using its reserve of dollars to buy euros.</p>
        <p>Thanks to the euro, the price of a McDonald's Big Mac costs less in Germany than in the United States. French wines, Belgian beers and Italian shoes are all bargains when priced in dollars.</p>
        <p>Euro bills and coins are not yet in circulation, but local currencies like the German mark and French franc are locked to the euro's value and controlled by the European Central Bank, in Frankfurt. That means that euro weakness matters little for Germans buying goods with marks or Italians with lire.</p>
        <p>''As long as I don't go on vacation in the United States, it doesn't bother me,'' said Dagmar Hofmann, a rose cultivator who brings her flowers into Frankfurt every Friday.</p>
        <p>But it means that the euro is suffering a crisis of confidence. Since its debut as the official monetary measure of Europe, used mostly by banks, corporations and stock markets, it has fallen from $1.17 to below $1 last year and to just 89 cents last week.</p>
        <p>The decline has mystified analysts, mortified politicians, alarmed central bankers and reignited suspicions among those who never liked the idea of giving up their currencies.</p>
        <p>''I believe we will have to pay dearly for the euro,'' said Rainer Forster, a 37-year-old electrician.  ''The British haven't joined yet, and now it turns out that was pretty clever.''</p>
        <p>Wim Duisenberg, the central bank president, said in his written statement on Friday, ''The euro's exchange rate has given rise to questions from European citizens who are concerned about the value of their currency.'' The implication that the bank might intervene cheered euro speculators, and the currency's value rose slightly against the dollar later in the day.</p>
        <p>''I understand their concerns, since a persistently lower euro exchange rate might ultimately lead to higher prices in the shops,'' he added.</p>
        <p>The vice president of the bank, Christian Noyer, was blunter, saying that intervention in the markets was ''a tool in our hand,'' and that ''we may use it.''</p>
        <p>For now, though, some Europeans have felt almost cheated. ''There is a general feeling of unfairness,'' the French newspaper Le Monde said in an editorial. ''Does the United States deserve such a strong currency? The dollar's superstar status demonstrates how well Washington is able to steer the international financial community into overlooking the weaknesses of the American economy.''</p>
        <p>Europe is hardly in an economic crisis. The euro countries are growing at a rate of about 3.4 percent this year, the fastest clip in years, and not that bad compared with the 4.5 percent expected for the United States. While inflation is lower than in the United States, unemployment is still high at 9.6 percent. American unemployment was 3.9 percent last month.</p>
        <p>Nor are volatile exchange rates anything new. But the fallout from the euro's plunge is getting serious.  It has greatly strengthened the position of opponents in Britain, which will make it more difficult for Britain to adopt the currency.</p>
        <p>Partly in response, conservative German politicians demanded last week that Greece be barred from adopting the euro for several years. The European Commission recommended on Wednesday that Greece be allowed to join. But when the euro dropped to a low of 88.9 cents on Thursday, the Bavarian governor, Edmund Stoiber, blamed the decline in part on the news about Greece.</p>
        <p>The economic consequences are beginning as well. With import prices higher, inflation in the euro zone reached 2.1 percent in March.</p>
        <p>By making European goods cheaper in American dollars, the euro has fueled a boom in European exports,  and that has propelled German economic growth, which is expected to more than double from last year.</p>
        <p>But the euro has also created a deep economic wedge between Britain and the Continent. The pound has risen just as sharply against the euro as the dollar, with devastating results for British manufacturers.</p>
        <p>Thanks to the strong pound, British products are now expensive in continental Europe, and Britain is being flooded with low-priced imports from the Continent.</p>
        <p>Exchange rate problems were one reason for catastrophic losses at Rover, the British maker of four-wheel-drive vehicles that Bayerische Motoren Werke A.G. bought and tried to export to Europe and is now desperately trying to sell.</p>
        <p>Jaguar, the luxury auto maker, has absorbed what amounts to a double-digit price decline in Germany to keep from losing market share. So some Jaguar models in Germany cost less than in Britain.</p>
        <p>British consumers, furious, have started a campaign called ''Rip-Off Britain'' to put pressure on companies that charge more for products in Britain than on the Continent.</p>
        <p>But the big debate is about the reasons for the decline, which has confounded economists.</p>
        <p>The most common explanation is that the American economy's remarkable boom has been an unprecedented magnet for money.</p>
        <p>One common criticism of the euro-zone economies is that they have not yet deregulated their labor markets and reduced taxes.</p>
        <p>Others point to conflicting signals from the European Central Bank. ''I admit that we have not always been equally successful in communicating our policy intentions to the public,'' Sirkka Haemaelaeinen, a member of the bank's executive board, conceded in a speech last week.</p>
        <p>The problems may go deeper.  Economists note that the bank has been following a surprisingly loose monetary policy.</p>
        <p>Not only are interest rates substantially lower in Europe than in the United States, but the supply of money has also consistently expanded faster than the central bank's own targets, hurting the euro's value.</p>
        <p>So far, ordinary citizens have remained fairly relaxed. Even many Germans, who treated the mark with almost religious reverence, seem patient.</p>
        <p>''The euro's image is pretty bad right now, but I think it has been bad-mouthed,'' said Severin Fiebon, a 27-year-old bank worker in Frankfurt. ''The euro is still very young.''</p>
        <p>Gerhard Bocke, a retired teacher here, said he has lived through big swings before. ''The exchange rate between the dollar and mark has changed so often,'' Mr. Bocke said on Thursday. ''It goes up, then it goes down. I don't really care about it as long as I don't travel to America.''</p>
