        <p>Carlos Franco, the defending champion, survived a bogey on the first playoff hole and then made a 3-foot putt for par on the second to win the $3.5 million Compaq Classic yesterday in New Orleans.</p>
        <p>The 18th hole was the undoing of Blaine McCallister in both regulation and the playoff.</p>
        <p>McCallister, who last won a PGA tournament in 1993, had a one-stroke lead over Franco after 17 holes. His second shot on the 72nd hole went into the front bunker, and he missed a 12-foot putt for par. Franco saved par by making a 5-footer, leaving both with closing four-under-par 68's and 18-under 270 totals at the 7,116-yard English Turn Golf and Country Club course.</p>
        <p>The playoff started on No. 18, and Franco hit into a fairway bunker off the tee. His third shot went to the fringe of the green and he went about 5 feet past the hole and made a bogey 5.</p>
        <p>McCallister was on in two and had about a 30-footer for birdie, but he missed that and a 6-footer for par.</p>
        <p>On the second playoff hole, the par-4 16th, McCallister hit into a bunker off the tee and then into a greenside trap, which he could not get out of. His fourth shot went through the green.</p>
        <p>Franco's second shot also went into a greenside trap, but he hit within 3 feet and made the putt for the $612,000 first prize.</p>
        <p>Last year's victory in New Orleans was the first PGA Tour victory for Franco, a native of Paraguay. His eight rounds in this tournament have all been in the 60's.</p>
        <p>DAVIES HANGS ON: Laura Davies of England shot a two-over-par 72 but held on for a two-stroke victory over Dottie Pepper in the Philips Invitational in Austin, Tex. Davies finished at five-under 275 to claim her second title of the year and the 60th of her international career. She needs just 3 more points in the L.P.G.A.'s scoring system for automatic qualification to the Hall of Fame.</p>
        <p>Pepper started the day seven strokes off the lead but closed with three birdies over the final six holes for a 67. She watched from the clubhouse for an hour as her score kept moving her up the leader board.</p>
        <p>Davies started the final round with a three-stroke lead over Susie Redman and Tammie Green before struggles with her putter let the field stay close on the final day.</p>
        <p>FLEISHER WINS AGAIN: Bruce Fleisher won his third Senior PGA Tour event of the season, making a birdie on the third playoff hole to beat Hubert Green and retain his title in the Home Depot Invitational at Charlotte, N.C.</p>
        <p>Fleisher, who closed with a 68, is the only player on the 50-and-over circuit to win more than once this year. He earned $195,000 with the victory to move within $17,000 of $1 million.</p>
        <p>Fleisher and Green each matched the tournament record with 13-under-par 203 finishes. Bob Murphy, Lee Trevino and Don Bies also share that 54-hole mark.</p>
        <p>Both players birdied and parred the first two playoff holes before Fleisher hit a 90-yard approach shot to 3 feet on the par-5 18th hole. Green missed his 12-foot birdie putt just left and Fleisher -- after backing away once -- sank his short one for the victory.</p>
