        <p>ONE-hundred-and-ninety-eight times in his career, Frank Robinson was either plugged, plunked, clipped, grazed, drilled or beaned by a baseball, the third-highest total in Major League Baseball history.</p>
        <p>Robinson, however, says, only once was he provoked to take a step or two toward the mound, and that was against San Francisco.</p>
        <p>''They had a reputation, and there were circumstances,'' he explained the other day, adding that the Giants had whacked him in the same arm five days earlier.</p>
        <p>Nowadays, when a pitcher throws the ball on the inside of the plate, hitters see it as an insult that must be avenged on the spot.</p>
        <p>In charge of sorting all this out is Robinson, baseball's vice president of on-field operations, who brings the instant credibility of a Hall of Fame hitter who later managed three teams and maybe, a time or two, ordered a knockdown.</p>
        <p>''The dynamics have changed,'' Robinson said the other day. ''There was no warning rule when I played. You had to protect yourself. If a pitcher wanted to hit you five times in a game, he could. Today, if the umpire feels a pitcher deliberately hit somebody, he can eject him from a game.''</p>
        <p>Last week Robinson suspended Pedro Martinez, one of the best pitchers in the universe, for five games for hitting a batter after having been warned by an umpire not to retaliate for a previous hit batter. Robinson will not discuss the specifics but will discuss the nasty borderline between professional intimidation and flat-out terrorism.</p>
        <p>As a card-carrying member of the hitters union (586 homers, .294 career average), he gives the impression the hitters are even more out of control than the pitchers.</p>
        <p>Exhibit A: The other day, Dennis Cook of the Mets hit Marvin Benard of the Giants in the back -- tied score, eighth inning, one out, runners on second and third. Benard stepped in front of home and glared at Cook, long enough to empty both benches, just one hothead short of a fight.</p>
        <p>''Look at the score,'' Robinson said. ''Benard's a lefty, Cook's a lefty, he wants to get him out. It's times like that when batters should realize pitchers don't have perfect control.''</p>
        <p>In these expansion days, when many great athletes are out trying to be the next Michael Jordan, baseball is stuck with untrained pitchers who can't work inside and hitters who flail at everything.</p>
        <p>''There is an art to pitching inside,'' Robinson said. ''There is an art of brushing back a hitter. There is also an art of getting out of the way of a pitch.''</p>
        <p>He acknowledges the tradition of headhunters: ''There are always guys who are not good enough to get people out. If you have to resort to that, it's pretty bad.''</p>
        <p>And he talks with reverence about Don Drysdale, who at least smiled in a vicious sort of way, and Bob Gibson, who was downright tetchy.</p>
        <p>''Why did they call Sal Maglie the Barber?'' Robinson added, in homage to the glowering New York presence of the 1950's. ''Because he knew how to shave you.''</p>
        <p>Robinson said today's hitters rarely think: ''Hey, it was my fault. I didn't react.'' He added, ''The hitters today are all looking for the ball away. The pitcher has the right to pitch inside, but if they throw at the head or the shoulder, they should be penalized.''</p>
        <p>He has his theories on why tempers are up.</p>
        <p>''A whole generation has come up,'' Robinson said. ''Maybe it's the aluminum bats they use as kids. Pitchers don't get used to pitching inside because they are not rewarded for it. Now you get into pro ball and the pitchers try to reclaim the inside of the plate and they don't know how to do it.''</p>
        <p>Robinson said he once managed a hitter who said, ''Hey, tell them to get the ball over the plate.'' He had to explain to his hitter that it was part of the game to run the ball inside. ''When you talk like that, they look at you like you're from another era,'' Robinson said, ''which maybe I am.''</p>
        <p>He set an example for Don Baylor, the career-leading hit batsman with 267, who would take one on a meaty part of the body, smart enough to know he had just made the equivalent of a single. Ron Hunt, second with 243, had lesser talents and wore baggy uniforms, hung over the plate, and smirked as he trotted down to first base.</p>
        <p>''Today it's just like the N.B.A.,'' Robinson said, referring to the sport that hangs around far too long into baseball weather. ''Today you have players dunking on people, jawing at people. It's the same thing in baseball. The pitcher throws inside, he's staring at the hitter, the hitter is jawing back at him.''</p>
        <p>Robinson, who took the feistiness of the National League to the placid Brother-in-Law League back in 1966, added: ''What I'm trying to get across to pitchers is that they don't have to retaliate. There are other ways to settle things. You can slide hard into a base.''</p>
        <p>Some players are hard to miss because of their lunging habits and their miscellaneous armor, said Joe Torre, the manager of the Yankees: ''Mo Vaughn, you can't pitch inside to him with all that equipment.''</p>
        <p>In addition to the mandatory helmets, players now wear elbow guards, shinguards, wrist guards that theoretically protect against injury but also bulge out an inch or three, thereby making it easier for them to get hit and escalate the cycle of resentment.</p>
        <p>The numbers of hit batsmen are up slightly from 278 to 300 in the first 412 games of both 1999 to 2000, which may be statistically meaningless. Home runs are surely up. The balls are tightly wound -- and so are the players.</p>
