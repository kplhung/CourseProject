        <p>Sierra Leone edged back toward war today as government and rebel forces fought each other in a town not too far from the capital here, and the United Nations force that is supposed to keep a peace between them sank deeper into disarray.</p>
        <p>Panic spread through Freetown early today after the United Nations force mistakenly announced that rebels of the Revolutionary United Front were advancing on the capital by using human shields and stood less than 15 miles from this seaside capital. Even after the United Nations retracted its announcement in the predawn hours, the streets of Freetown remained tense through the day.</p>
        <p>Rifle-toting former soldiers who had fought against the government roamed the streets. They should have been disarmed under the terms of a peace accord reached nine months ago. Hundreds of them assembled at the national stadium after their leader, Lt. Col. Johnny Paul Koroma, the chief of a junta that briefly controlled Sierra Leone in 1997, said on national radio that no one had a monopoly on violence.</p>
        <p>A government helicopter gunship attacked the road junction town of Rogberri, about 25 miles east of here, as rebels were said to be advancing from that direction, according to Oluyemi Adeniji, the United Nations special envoy to Sierra Leone. He said his mission had learned of the assault only after it had taken place. The international force took reporters to the area today to show that it was not under rebel control, although many refugees could be seen fleeing.</p>
        <p>''There have been some violations on both sides,'' Mr. Adeniji said at a news conference. ''So we are now picking up the pieces and trying to put things back to the status quo.''</p>
        <p>The fighting largely eclipsed diplomatic efforts made to secure the release of more than 500 United Nations peacekeepers and civilians still being held hostage by the rebels. Foday Sankoh, the leader of the rebellion, still denied that his men were holding hostages, although Mr. Adeniji said Mr. Sankoh had pledged to help the United Nations locate its missing personnel.</p>
        <p>Britain, the former colonial power in Sierra Leone, announced today that it was sending warships and 700 to 800 troops to West Africa to help citizens leave the country.</p>
        <p>[In Washington, the Clinton administration is still pondering a request to provide air transport for Bangladeshi soldiers scheduled to join the United Nations mission in Sierra Leone and indicated that it expects the British to take the lead in any international response to the crisis.</p>
        <p>[''We are going to help,'' said a senior administration official. ''The directive we have is to be helpful and to respond positively.'']</p>
        <p>Despite this small West African country's relative lack of political significance, the success or failure of the United Nations here will be closely watched in Africa. Perhaps more than any other African country, Sierra Leone -- where a nine-year civil war produced searing images of mutilated men, women and children -- came to symbolize the West's post-cold-war indifference to Africa and its conflicts.</p>
        <p>And so if Sierra Leone was regarded as a recommitment of the international community to peacekeeping in Africa, the mission so far has proven to be an embarrassment for the Western governments, including the Clinton Administration, which supported it.</p>
        <p>Asked about the falling credibility of the international peacekeeping effort, Mr. Adeniji said that ''people tend to exaggerate mistakes and to minimize credit.''</p>
        <p>In New York today, the United Nations spokesman, Fred Eckhard, said Bernard Miyet, the chief of peacekeeping for the United Nations, left today for Freetown to help negotiate the release of the hostages and bolster the morale of the other peacekeepers.</p>
        <p>The latest humiliating setback for the United Nations took place with the false announcement of an imminent invasion by the rebels, who had frequently accused the peacekeeping mission of creating panic by spreading false information. United Nations personnel and vehicles moved across town in the middle of the night to western Freetown, as Philip Winslow, the spokesman for the United Nations operation here, talked about the impending invasion live on CNN.</p>
        <p>Mr. Adeniji said that the mistake happened after reports were taken  ''without proper verification.''</p>
        <p>The mistake, however, seemed to increase the population's skepticism about the peacekeeping mission.</p>
        <p>''If they could not give us adequate information about what is going on in the country, about security positions, then it is clear to us that they are not competent to protect us,'' said Sahr Kellie, 26, a university student who had come to the stadium. ''I don't trust them anymore.''</p>
        <p>The State Department ordered the departure today of non-essential staff from the American Embassy here, and evacuated Americans aboard helicopters.</p>
        <p>Many non-essential United Nations personnel and workers for non-governmental organizations were evacuated over the weekend, and the departure of many foreigners appeared to deepen many Sierra Leoneans' anger at the United Nations.</p>
        <p>James Roy, 42, said he had come to the stadium to show support for the former soldiers, because he had lost faith in the United Nations and feared that its mission here might fail, as other missions by the international organization had failed elsewhere in Africa.</p>
        <p>''I am a Sierra Leonean who has been suffering for nine years,'' he said. ''And your United Nations is not coming to do anything. How could 300 men with all their ammunition, and all their reputation, allow themselves to be disarmed like that?''</p>
        <p>''The same thing happened in Angola,'' he said. ''The same thing happened in Somalia. I don't want a repeat of that here.''</p>
        <p>The former soldiers at the stadium, onetime allies of the Revolutionary United Front, fought against the government of President Ahmad Tejan Kabbah. In a brutal assault on Freetown in January 1999, the rebels and soldiers killed thousands of civilians and chopped off the hands, arms and legs of hundreds. A Nigerian-led West African peacekeeping force prevented the fall of Freetown at the last minute.</p>
        <p>Under pressure from abroad, President Kabbah signed a peace agreement with the rebels last July. The accord lifted a death penalty that had been imposed on Mr. Sankoh and made the rebel leader a member of a power-sharing government. Under the accord, the 45,000 estimated combatants were supposed to have finished voluntarily disarming last year. But the combatants, especially those belonging to Mr. Sankoh's group, delayed doing so.</p>
        <p>According to official figures, half of the total are said to have disarmed. But the real figure is probably lower. It is impossible to know precisely how many fighters answer Mr. Sankoh's orders, but it could be more than 10,000. The United Nations force was expected to reach a full strength of 11,000 by July; it now has 8,700 troops in Sierra Leone.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sankoh blames the United Nations for the current crisis, saying that its peacekeepers tried to force some of his men to disarm. But officials with the peacekeeping force and American officials say the clashes appeared to have been well coordinated by Mr. Sankoh's group.</p>
        <p>The hostage-taking and killing of Kenyan peacekeepers occurred at three different locations last week just as the Nigerian-led West African force pulled out of Sierra Leone.</p>
        <p>It became increasingly clear that Mr. Sankoh was not interested in peace.</p>
        <p>In recent months, as his men delayed disarming and frantically mined diamonds in the Kono district, which they kept off-limits to the United Nations force, it was thought that Mr. Sankoh amassed a war chest for a future election or war.</p>
        <p>The United Nations force made very slow progress as it saw its movements often blocked by the rebels. Peacekeepers were disarmed by rebels in several instances.</p>
        <p>But in the last week, the rebels seemed to gain control over the peacekeepers with surprising ease. Clearly embarrassed by the situation, United Nations officials have been reluctant to provide details of the incidents. At first, they said they could not explain the whereabouts of certain troops, simply saying that they were no longer in contact with United Nations headquarters.</p>
        <p>It is still unclear how many hostages there are and how many peacekeepers have been killed. Until this evening, United Nations officials had been saying that 300 were being held hostage and that they had lost contact with 200 Zambians.</p>
        <p>At a news conference tonight, Mr. Adeniji, the special envoy, was asked whether the 200 were now considered hostages. ''As long as they've not been found, they've not returned, that's our assumption,'' he said.</p>
