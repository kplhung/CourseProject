      <abstract>
        <p>Op-Ed article by Ward Connerly, chairman of American Civil Rights Institute, accuses booksellers of practicing insidious kind of discrimination by segregating books written by black authors to shelves designated as being of interest to African-Americans; says such redlining is a great disservice to black authors and the general book-buying public</p>

        <p>If you're looking for one of the last bastions of segregation in America today, you are likely to find it at your local bookstore. I learned to my surprise and consternation last week that a customer looking for a specific book may need to identify and be conscious of the race of the author in order to locate it. Or the customer will need to presume that the subject matter is an issue of importance only to readers of a specific race.</p>
        <p>As a recently published author, I stopped by a prominent bookstore in Washington a few days ago to autograph its stock of my new book, which recounts the story of my advocacy against racial preferences.  First I looked in the ''New Arrivals'' section. It was not there. Nor was it in ''Politics &amp; Government'' or ''Biography &amp; Autobiography.''</p>

        <p>If you're looking for one of the last bastions of segregation in America today, you are likely to find it at your local bookstore. I learned to my surprise and consternation last week that a customer looking for a specific book may need to identify and be conscious of the race of the author in order to locate it. Or the customer will need to presume that the subject matter is an issue of importance only to readers of a specific race.</p>
        <p>As a recently published author, I stopped by a prominent bookstore in Washington a few days ago to autograph its stock of my new book, which recounts the story of my advocacy against racial preferences.  First I looked in the ''New Arrivals'' section. It was not there. Nor was it in ''Politics &amp; Government'' or ''Biography &amp; Autobiography.''</p>
        <p>When I asked a store employee to check to see if the book had been ordered, the manager recognized me as the author and helpfully explained that the book had been shelved under ''African-American Interest.'' When I asked why he had placed the book in that section, he said he had done so as a ''service to the community.''</p>
        <p>The ''service'' to the African-American ''community'' is in reality a great disservice to the general book-buying public. And for those authors like me who find themselves consigned to the redlined literary ghetto, it represents discrimination of the most insidious type.</p>
        <p>One of the great joys of bookstore shopping is serendipity, the unplanned discovery of a book one hadn't known existed. Most of my book purchases over the years have been the result of such chance encounters, and I know that I am not alone. Publishers, after all, work hard to design attractive dust jackets to encourage impulse buying.</p>
        <p>But for black authors -- or any authors who write about race issues -- the ''special section'' approach rules out the serendipitous purchase. Only those book buyers who self-consciously identify with the ''black community'' are likely to head for the ''African-American Interest'' shelves.</p>
        <p>What about other readers who may be interested in the subjects we're writing about? If they browse in ''Performing Arts,'' will they find the new biography of David Geffen, but not Sidney Poitier's memoir? If they check the shelves in ''American History,'' will they see Tom Brokaw's books on the World War II generation but not Michael Eric Dyson's controversial reinterpretation of the life of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.?</p>
        <p>The shelving of their books in a special section deprives black authors or ''race'' authors of significant sales opportunities, putting them at a competitive disadvantage compared with authors whose books are not ghettoized.</p>
        <p>But the economic harm pales in contrast to the intellectual and cultural damage caused by the bookstores' version of racial profiling. They have fallen into the trap of thinking that a writer's skin color is a reliable guide to judging the contents of his or her books. My book, like those by other writers who happen to be black, is meant for readers of any race interested in the subjects and controversies I address. By relying on a blatant stereotype -- that blacks are the only ones interested in the history, culture and politics of black people -- the bookstores marginalize some writers and limit their ability to reach out to a broader audience and to share common bonds and values.</p>
        <p>If bookstores are truly interested in performing a ''service to the community,'' they should make an active effort to integrate black writers, and writers of other ethnic and racial groups, into the general mainstream of the publishing world, and to allow books to rise and fall on their literary and intellectual merits -- not on their supposed narrow appeal to racial pride.</p>
        <p>''Separate but equal'' did blacks no favors in schools or on public transportation; it does us no favors in bookstores, either.</p>
