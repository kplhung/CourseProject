        <p>If you can get past the politics that keep a sense of impending doom hovering over the city's school system, you can actually find some pockets of good news.</p>
        <p>Most parents would welcome an initiative that resulted in improved test scores, more manageable classrooms and heightened morale among teachers and principals. That's what you're supposed to get when you reduce class sizes. And, according to a new report from the nonprofit Educational Priorities Panel, that's what's been happening in some New York City schools in which classes in the very early grades have been reduced to about 20 pupils.</p>
        <p>Yes, the long knives are out for Harold Levy, the interim chancellor. Yes, the needs of children are  frequently sacrificed to the power cravings of ruthless politicians and mindless bureaucrats. But as this report shows, there are also some modest successes.</p>
        <p>Substantial amounts of money from the state and federal governments have been flowing into the school system to reduce class sizes in some schools from kindergarten through third grade. The Educational Priorities Panel did a survey of five schools where the program has been under way for at least a year and compiled the results in a report called ''Smaller is Better.''</p>
        <p>The report found:</p>
        <p>* That students in the smaller classes tended to display a greater enthusiasm for reading and appeared to be learning faster than the year before, although it was too early to make definitive judgments.</p>
        <p>* That there was a noticeable decline in disciplinary problems.</p>
        <p>* That parental involvement increased.</p>
        <p>* That teacher morale increased and schools found it easier to hire more qualified and experienced teachers.</p>
        <p>One might ask, ''What took so long?'' It seems obvious that even the best teachers would be handicapped by the huge, unruly classes that have plagued so many of the city's schools for so many years. And there is now substantial research showing that reduced class size is the most effective way to improve student performance, especially in the very early grades.</p>
        <p>This year, with the help of $110 million in state and federal money, about 950 smaller classes were established in the city's schools, according to Leonie Haimson, a consultant to the E.P.P. and author of the report. But while there are smaller classes in 530 of the city's 675 elementary schools, some of the schools were able to reduce classes in only one or two grades.</p>
        <p>The report said that over all about 30 percent of the pupils in kindergarten through third grade are now in smaller classes.</p>
        <p>Not surprisingly, the teachers and the principals love it.</p>
        <p>Ivy Sherman, the principal at P.S. 139 in Brooklyn, told me last week: ''It's working wonderfully. The children's needs are being met individually. Teachers can really work one on one with the children, identifying their strengths and weaknesses. Our classes are heterogeneously grouped -- you know, mixed abilities -- and having a smaller class allows the teacher to address everybody's different learning style.''</p>
        <p>Ms. Sherman was quoted in the report as saying: ''The first year I got here, 48 percent of the first graders were meeting or exceeding their grade level on the California Achievement Test. Last year it was 69 percent.''</p>
        <p>If this were easy it wouldn't be New York. While state and federal money is coming in, and even more will be available next year, so many of the city's schools are in such bad physical condition, and there is so much overcrowding, that many schools are unable to use the money to reduce the size of their classes.</p>
        <p>Schools that are too crowded to create new, smaller classes are, in some cases, using ''floating teachers'' to provide additional instruction to small groups of pupils in their regular classrooms. This method is having mixed results.</p>
        <p>The lesson to be learned here is that, politics and fights over financing aside, there no longer seems to be any question about the important benefits of reducing class size, especially in the earliest grades. Studies have shown that those benefits last for years. The challenge in New York -- a huge one -- is to keep the money flowing while rebuilding the physical plant to the point where smaller classrooms are the norm.</p>
