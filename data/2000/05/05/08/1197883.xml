        <p>THE BALLAD OF LITTLE RIVER</p>
        <p>A Tale of Race and Restless Youth in the Rural South</p>
        <p>By Paul Hemphill</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 235 pages. The Free Press. $25.</p>
        <p>It is a mournful ballad of rural life in the South that Paul Hemphill chants in his new book, ''The Ballad of Little River.'' It is a ballad that brings to mind many cultural references, James Agee's ''Let Us Now Praise Famous Men'' and Walker Evans's haunting photographs of rural poverty and what Mr. Hemphill himself calls ''a Faulknerian huddle of fairly exotic proportions.''</p>
        <p>Little River is an undistinguished place in southern Alabama where in 1997 five local white youths, bored and drunk and, it would seem, prone to racist incitement, burned down one small, bedraggled black church, and some of them vandalized another one. Mr. Hemphill rented a cabin in town and chronicled it for a year. His purpose was to get to know the inhabitants, half of them black, half white, to understand the place from which the five miscreants had emerged.</p>

        <p>THE BALLAD OF LITTLE RIVER</p>
        <p>A Tale of Race and Restless Youth in the Rural South</p>
        <p>By Paul Hemphill</p>
        <p>Illustrated. 235 pages. The Free Press. $25.</p>
        <p>It is a mournful ballad of rural life in the South that Paul Hemphill chants in his new book, ''The Ballad of Little River.'' It is a ballad that brings to mind many cultural references, James Agee's ''Let Us Now Praise Famous Men'' and Walker Evans's haunting photographs of rural poverty and what Mr. Hemphill himself calls ''a Faulknerian huddle of fairly exotic proportions.''</p>
        <p>Little River is an undistinguished place in southern Alabama where in 1997 five local white youths, bored and drunk and, it would seem, prone to racist incitement, burned down one small, bedraggled black church, and some of them vandalized another one. Mr. Hemphill rented a cabin in town and chronicled it for a year. His purpose was to get to know the inhabitants, half of them black, half white, to understand the place from which the five miscreants had emerged.</p>
        <p>The result of his investigation is a melancholy and savory story of a kind of forgotten America where people face dead-end jobs and despair with six-packs of beer, the occasional joint and a kind of heedless self-justification. Almost nobody has a happy story in Mr. Hemphill's instructive and finely tuned portrait, which serves as a reminder that the world of Agee, Evans and Faulkner is not entirely behind us.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hemphill structures his story along familiar narrative lines, portraying Little River as the kind of place where nothing much had happened since a famous Indian massacre of the early 19th century, until things began to unravel publicly early in 1997. A young black man was shot and killed breaking into a white-owned home late at night. A white grocer liked by everybody, black and white, was savagely beaten by a black ex-convict. Then a newcomer to town held a Ku Klux Klan rally on his five-acre spread, and two days after that the five white youths struck at the tiny St. Joe Baptist Church and at the somewhat larger Tate Chapel just down the country road.</p>
        <p>The attacks on the churches brought an unwelcome prominence to Little River, which lies alongside Alabama Highway 59, running through one of the poorest counties in the United States. The church burnings, which reflected similar incidents taking place elsewhere in the South, were aggressively prosecuted, with the local district attorney trying to use new hate-crime legislation to get enhanced sentences for the defendants.</p>
        <p>What Mr. Hemphill succeeds in doing in his casual, understated, almost aw-shucks way, is get under the skin of a troubled community. And the images of American gothic life that emerge from his piquant pages indicate that the phrase ''hate crime'' doesn't quite explain things. A deeply rooted racial hostility certainly existed in forlorn Little River, where one supposedly enlightened white man accounted for the success of a local black woman by explaining she had some white blood in her.</p>
        <p>But the relations between the races had always been peaceful, if distant. The church-burning seemed more a consequence of a sort of moral disintegration -- family violence, divorce, chronic feuding, infidelity, heavy drinking and welfare cheating -- that was a good deal more pronounced among Little River's whites than among its blacks.</p>
        <p>''There was a gaggle of about two dozen of them out there on the 20-mile stretch of road between Little River and Uriah: white kids who were about to graduate from high school, sons and daughters of dysfunctional families, kids with few hopes and dreams beyond finding some menial job or marrying within the clan, kids who had not even been given a road map about how to live a noble life,'' Mr. Hemphill writes.</p>
        <p>His narrative has as much to do with getting to know the denizens of Little River as with tracing the course of the events that took place there. He captures the minds and mentalities of men whose entire lives have taken place in isolated trailers parked in steamy, piney woods, or in jail. There were, to take one example among many possible examples, Tommy and George Boone, members of Little River's largest white clan who, as Mr. Hemphill puts it, ''were in a competition to see which one could get the most ink.''</p>
        <p>Tommy got 20 years for burglarizing fish camps and homes throughout the area. George lived ''alone in an old trailer down a dirt road behind the cafe run by his ex-wife and her common-law husband, his brother Leroy.'' One morning he got taken to jail after firing at the cafe because two other members of the Boone clan who had denigrated him were in it. He told Mr. Hemphill: ''Attempted murder? Hell, I was just trying to get their attention.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Hemphill has a good ear for the vernacular, and he allows his dramatis personae to reveal themselves without comment. But he clearly has a good deal of sympathy for the struggling blacks of Little River even as he avoids the temptation to sanctify them. The pastor of St. Joe Baptist Church, Joe Dees, is the main black figure portrayed in this book, and he is a complicated figure. He was mentally disturbed for years; his behavior was erratic and sometimes irresponsible, and his wrecked church, to tell the truth, was in an advanced stage of dilapidation.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Dees raised five children who were doing well in life, and his instability was a matter of chemical imbalance. An interesting fact about Little River is that many of the town's black children went to college while very few of the whites did. ''They had to try harder, and they and their parents knew it,'' Mr. Hemphill concludes of the blacks. Most of the white parents, by contrast, ''assumed that everything would work out fine in their favor, just like it always had, simply because of the color of their skin.''</p>
        <p>The events of 1997, which resulted in the imprisonment of five white youths, showed the fatal flaw in that reasoning. Mr. Hemphill, in demonstrating this, did not, by his own description of things, earn great popularity among Little River's whites. Still, he has held up a mirror to them, and to the rest of us in the complicated American racial diorama, and it is well worth our attention.</p>
