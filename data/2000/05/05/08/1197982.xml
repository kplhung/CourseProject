        <p>The official farewell to Cardinal John O'Connor culminates this afternoon in his funeral Mass, an intricately choreographed service that reflects the work of hundreds of people, many of them volunteers, most of them little noticed.</p>
        <p>The Organist</p>
        <p>Donald Dumler, the principal organist of St. Patrick's Cathedral, grew up in what he calls a ''Little House on the Prairie'' town of Okeene, Okla. There he played cocktail music on a Wurlitzer spinet during ''rattlesnake banquets'' in the high school auditorium, where live rattlesnakes were milked of their venom and dead ones were served for dinner.</p>
        <p>A Southern Baptist, Mr. Dumler decided to be an organist in 1955, when he heard the pipe organ during St. Patrick's televised midnight Mass on Christmas Eve. But he never thought he would end up there -- or anywhere ''north of Wichita,'' he said in an interview at the cathedral yesterday.</p>
        <p>He graduated from Juilliard in 1967, and in 1971 joined St. Patrick's, where he soon grew accustomed to ritual and pomp. He played for the pope's Mass at Yankee Stadium in 1978. During the pope's 1995 visit, Mr. Dumler played the organ during the rosary.</p>
        <p>Mr. Dumler has also played his share of Masses for celebrities, including the funerals of Ed Sullivan and Bing Crosby. Today's funeral Mass will not be his first for an archbishop; that was Cardinal Terence Cooke's in 1983.</p>
        <p>''It's an awesome feeling,'' he said over a Southern-style iced tea before pulling on his robe and shoulder cape for yesterday's 1 p.m. Mass. ''I think part of it is nerves. The adrenaline. I have to constantly be ready for the unexpected.''</p>
        <p>By way of example, he reached for hastily penciled score. At the Spanish-language rosary on Saturday night, he had been unable to find the music for the final hymn, ''Santa Maria del Camino.''</p>
        <p>At the last minute, he said, a priest hummed it, and he wrote it down.</p>
        <p>The music today, Mr. Dumler said, will be much less scripted than what one might expect for such a solemn occasion, especially during the 45-minute procession of the clergy, which Mr. Dumler will watch on a video monitor while seated at his five-tiered keyboard.</p>
        <p>''A lot will be on the spot,'' he said of the music he will play. ''The choir director will point at me, and I will just take off. I call it horsing around, but it's really improvisation. Maybe some Bach.''</p>
