        <p>Gov. George E. Pataki yesterday proposed the creation of a state DNA Review Committee that would examine all convictions in New York overturned because of new genetic evidence. The panel would also propose regulations to improve the use of the precise forensic science of DNA profiling by the state's criminal justice system.</p>
        <p>In recent years, as the reliability of genetic evidence has improved, DNA testing has been used to set aside 64 criminal convictions in the United States, according to the Innocence Project at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University. Seven of the overturned convictions have been in New York.</p>
        <p>In the most prominent New York case, Victor H. Jenkins was convicted of raping a Buffalo woman in 1982,  when current DNA profiling methods did not exist. Mr. Jenkins served 17 years in prison before DNA evidence exonerated him last year. Mr. Pataki said yesterday that the committee would work to find the causes of this mistaken conviction and of others in New York, and would make proposals to use forensic DNA more thoroughly in future investigations.</p>
        <p>''The point is not to convict someone of a crime,'' Mr. Pataki said. ''The point is to convict the right person of a crime.''</p>
        <p>Under Mr. Pataki's plan, the review committee, which would require legislative approval to be created, would serve as a subcommittee of the 14-member State Forensic Science Commission, a board that is responsible for certifying crime labs.  It would include defense lawyers, prosecutors, judges, forensic scientists and senior police officials.</p>
        <p>Barry C. Scheck, a law professor and a member of the commission, said the committee would examine each conviction in New York that was set aside by exculpatory DNA evidence.</p>
        <p>''One of the things that is amazing about DNA exonerations is that no opinion is ever written about them,'' Mr. Scheck said yesterday. ''What happens is the judge just issues an order and the person walks out of prison. The idea is to have a blue-ribbon commission that basically would issue a report about what went wrong.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Scheck is a co-author of ''Actual Innocence: Five Days to Execution and Other Dispatches from the Wrongfully Convicted'' and is a co-founder of the Innocence Project, which has helped exonerate dozens of inmates through post-conviction DNA testing. He said the project's review of DNA exonerations had found the most common causes.</p>
        <p>These include, he said, incompetent defense counsel, shoddy or fraudulent crime labs, inaccurate identification by witnesses, false confessions, misconduct by the police and prosecutors, and reliance on incriminating testimony from inmates who negotiate with the authorities, witnesses often referred to by defense lawyers as ''jailhouse snitches.''</p>
        <p>In the case of Mr. Jenkins, when the 23-year-old victim saw him at a Buffalo police garage, she did not identify him as the attacker. But later, after the police showed her a variety of pictures of Mr. Jenkins, and under what one of his defense lawyers described as suggestive pressure, she said he was the one who raped her. That identification led to the conviction; nearly two decades later, DNA evidence showed it was almost certainly wrong.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki said he had a personal brush with erroneous convictions in the 1980's, when Nathaniel Carter, with whom the governor played basketball as a teenager in Peekskill, N.Y., was convicted of murdering his former wife's foster mother. Mr. Carter spent 28 months in jail. He was freed when his former wife admitted to the crime.</p>
        <p>''It made me aware that we truly have to seek to have a fair system of justice,'' Mr. Pataki said yesterday.</p>
        <p>Howard Safir, commissioner of the New York Police Department, said he thought mistaken convictions were highly unusual but costly, because the innocent were punished while the real perpetrators remained at large, perhaps to prey on other victims. ''I think it's rare,'' Mr. Safir said. ''But I think even if it's one case, it's enough.''</p>
        <p>Mr. Safir, a vocal advocate for more extensive use of DNA in law enforcement, said that he had not heard many details of the governor's proposed review committee, but that he generally supported the concept. ''It sounds like he's right on the mark,'' he said.</p>
        <p>The governor plans to announce his proposal formally this morning in Manhattan at the Fifth Annual Conference on the Future of DNA.</p>
        <p>The proposal is the latest in a series of Mr. Pataki's DNA initiatives. Last year, he successfully pushed for the expansion of DNA testing, which now requires roughly 65 percent of convicted felons to submit DNA samples for a state offender database. This year he has proposed legislation to expand testing further, so that it includes any citizen convicted of any crime.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pataki has also proposed eliminating statutes of limitations for 16 felonies, including rape and second-degree sexual assault, in which DNA evidence is often collected.</p>
        <p>His latest proposal has many elements, he said. In addition to investigating the facts behind DNA exonerations, Mr. Pataki said, the review committee would be charged with creating state policies for the collection, handling and storage of DNA evidence by hospitals, police departments and laboratories.</p>
        <p>Two recent cases illustrated the need for these policies, the governor said.</p>
        <p>In the first case, the Westchester County district attorney's office was able to secure an indictment this year for a 1979 murder because the police had saved a sheet with the attacker's bloodstains on it. DNA testing matched the blood to that of Walter Gill, an inmate at the Sing Sing Correctional Facility in Ossining, N.Y. who recently submitted DNA to the state offender database.</p>
        <p>In the other case, Coney Island Hospital performed a rape examination last year but failed to properly collect and submit DNA from the victim, weakening the state's case against Anthony Jones, a serial sex offender who attacked the woman on the morning after he was released from prison. Mr. Jones was convicted this spring of second-degree assault. With no DNA evidence to support them, multiple sex-crime charges against him were dropped.</p>
        <p>''That was just a real tragedy,'' Mr. Pataki said.</p>
        <p>The governor said that many police officers and hospital employees did not yet have experience collecting DNA from victims and from crime scenes, and that even when it was properly collected, there was not a formal set of rules to govern its storage and retention. The committee would be asked to create them.</p>
        <p>''What we have to do is try to learn as much as we can as quickly as possible, and use that learning, and get it to the hospitals, the police departments and the prosecutors,'' Mr. Pataki said. ''We have this enormous new tool. We have to use it to benefit society in the strongest possible way.''</p>
