        <p>William H. Gates complains that everyone at Microsoft pitching a new project seems to invoke the notion of the innovator's dilemma. The term, Mr. Gates told Forbes magazine last year, is ''a required slide in every funding presentation.''</p>
        <p>Still, Mr. Gates might do well to pay attention, says Clayton M. Christensen, the Harvard Business School professor who coined the phrase. His book, ''The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail,'' has been causing a stir at technology companies since it was published in 1997. It describes how leading companies are ambushed by new products.</p>
        <p>Technology industries, he says, go through life cycles. A large, integrated company makes sense, in his view, when a technology is young and it is a formidable task simply to make a product or service that works. In the days when the national telephone network was being built, Mr. Christensen said, ''a single company would have dominated, even if AT&amp;T were not created.''</p>
        <p>Yet as a technology matures, he noted, ''it causes the industry to disintegrate.'' Then, speed to market and ease of customization tend to matter more. That is when a technology leader is most susceptible to a disruptive technology coming up from the bottom.</p>
        <p>Today's market for personal computer software, Mr. Christensen insists, has the characteristics of maturity. ''For Microsoft, the mainstream product lines -- the Windows operating system and Office suite -- are just huge software programs,'' he said. ''Most users don't use more than 10 percent of their features.</p>
        <p>''And Java,'' Mr. Christensen said, referring to the Sun Microsystems language for Internet programming, ''is coming up.'' Like many insurgent technologies, he noted, Java was first developed for another market -- consumer electronics -- but it found its early use on the World Wide Web.</p>
        <p>His prognosis for Microsoft? ''No matter what happens in the antitrust case, Microsoft will go where I.B.M. went in mainframes,'' said Mr. Christensen, whose book is being published in paperback by HarperBusiness. ''Microsoft will still be dominant in PC operating systems but, like mainframes, that will not be the mainstream of computing anymore.</p>
        <p>''Microsoft,'' he added, ''will still be around, but it will not be the all-powerful entity it once was. This is the mechanism by which markets destroy monopoly.''</p>
