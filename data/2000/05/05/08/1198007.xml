        <p>Charlie Ward already had a reputation as a rugged competitor who leaves nothing but pain in his path before he added to it today.</p>
        <p>In the third quarter, Ward flashed by Tim Hardaway and left the Heat's limping point guard seizing up in pain. Quickly, Hardaway disappeared into the locker room three minutes into the period to get his injured left foot retaped.</p>
        <p>''I planted when Charlie drove and felt a lot of pain,'' said Hardaway, who re-entered the game with three minutes to go in the third. ''I had to get it retaped tighter.''</p>
        <p>In Hardaway's absence, Ward kept coming on yet another driving layup or two. Then he took part in a mad scramble for a loose ball at midcourt with 4 minutes 35 seconds left in the third quarter.</p>
        <p>Although Dan Majerle ended up with the ball, Ward dived in between Majerle and Alonzo Mourning. On his wild lunge into traffic, Ward accidentally head-butted Mourning on his right temple.</p>
        <p>''The football player he is, he shook it off,'' Mourning said. ''I had to gather myself and get back into it.''</p>
        <p>A dizzy Mourning needed an ice pack, while Ward played on without even rubbing his head. Once Ward was taken out of the game in the fourth quarter, the Knicks were not nearly as aggressive. They turned into jump shooters and stopped driving to the basket.</p>
        <p>''Charlie did what we should have all been doing,'' Chris Childs said. ''He was being aggressive in the third quarter; he was playing all out. He was scrambling out there with everything he had. Against a team like this, you have to push the ball. Charlie was doing that.''</p>
        <p>During the third quarter, Ward was 3 for 5 from the field, with 7 points, 4 assists and 2 rebounds in an aggressive 12 minutes. Without him, the Knicks, who trailed by as many as 8 points in the third, might not have recovered to make a game of it in the fourth quarter.</p>
        <p>''I was just trying to do my part,'' Ward said. ''We had our chances. We needed to execute a little better down the stretch. Chris had a chance and Larry had a chance. They had shots they usually put down. We got the shots we wanted, but we just missed them.''</p>
