        <p>Kerry Wood was bound to have a day like this.</p>
        <p>Making only his second appearance since undergoing reconstructive elbow surgery last year, Wood showed a few flashes of his past brilliance but looked mostly ordinary yesterday as the Pittsburgh Pirates beat the host Chicago Cubs by 11-3 yesterday.</p>
        <p>He struck out six, but gave up seven runs on seven hits in six and two-thirds innings. Six of those runs came on three-run homers by Kevin Young and Brian Giles.</p>
        <p>Wood (1-1) also walked five, hit a batter and threw one wild pitch. He threw 104 pitches, 60 of them for strikes.</p>
        <p>It was only his second loss at Wrigley Field, where he's now 10-2. His earned run average at home jumped from 2.87 to 3.30.</p>
        <p>Jason Schmidt (1-2), making his second start since returning from the disabled list, gave up two runs -- one earned -- on three hits in five innings.</p>
        <p>Luis Sojo added a three-run homer off Mark Guthrie as the Pirates completed their first three-game sweep at Wrigley Field since April 20-22, 1990.</p>
        <p>Wood, the 1998 National League rookie of the year, missed all of last season after blowing out his elbow in spring training. He had Tommy John reconstructive surgery in April 1999 and didn't throw a baseball again until July.</p>
        <p>He made an impressive return to the majors Tuesday, giving up one run on three hits and striking out four in six innings against Houston. He also homered in his first at-bat -- on the first pitch.</p>
        <p>But he got off to a rough start yesterday. Only three of his first 10 pitches were strikes, and he was working on his fourth batter when the pitching coach Oscar Acosta visited the mound.</p>
        <p>Young, the next batter up, hit the first pitch he saw to left field for a home run, giving Pittsburgh a 3-0 lead.</p>
        <p>Just as he did in his first outing, Wood settled down after the first inning. His pitch count dropped, and he didn't allow a hit in the second, third or fourth innings. Only two Pirates reached base, both on walks, and he got John Vander Wal on a huge swinging strikeout in the third.</p>
        <p>But Wood ran into some trouble again in the fifth. With two outs, he gave up singles to Warren Morris and Jason Kendall, and then Vander Wal hit an R.B.I. single for the 4-2 lead. He got out of the inning when Giles, the next batter up, popped up.</p>
        <p>He gave up three more runs in the seventh after walking Morris and Kendall, and left after Young doubled. He got a standing ovation as he left the field.</p>
        <p>PHILLIES 7, BRAVES 4: Philadelphia wasn't exactly the leading candidate to become the first visiting team to win a series at Turner Field this season.</p>
        <p>The last-place Phillies came to Atlanta 11 games behind the first-place Braves in the National League East. Then, to make matters worse, Philadelphia squandered a ninth-inning lead Friday night, losing when Andruw Jones hit a two-run homer.</p>
        <p>But the Phillies bounced back to win two in a row, including yesterday's victory when Mike Lieberthal hit a two-run homer and pitcher Andy Ashby helped himself at the plate with a two-run single.</p>
        <p>The Braves threatened in the ninth, scoring a run and loading the bases with one out before Wayne Gomes, who gave up the homer to Jones two days earlier, struck out Bobby Bonilla and got Javy Lopez on a grounder.</p>
        <p>Atlanta, which already set a modern franchise record with a 15-game winning streak and a record for any era with 12 straight home victories, lost two in a row for only the second time this season.</p>
        <p>In those games, the Braves had 22 hits but went 2 for 20 with runners in scoring position, resulting in 21 runners left on base. The home winning streak ended Saturday night when Curt Schilling threw an 11-hit shutout.</p>
        <p>The Braves have lost only two of their last 21 series at home, having won their first five this season.</p>
        <p>Ashby (2-3) surrendered 10 hits in seven innings but stranded seven runners.</p>
        <p>Starting pitcher Terry Mulholland (3-3), pounded for eight hits and five runs in three and one-third innings, walked off the mound after experiencing difficulty breathing. He underwent tests at Piedmont Hospital, where doctors determined he may have suffered heat-related problems on an 89-degree day.</p>
        <p>Mulholland was released from the emergency room yesterday afternoon and was expected to join the team in Florida, where the Braves begin a four-game series today.</p>
        <p>DIAMONDBACKS 8, PADRES 1: Todd Stottlemyre became the National League's third six-game winner as host Arizona won its fourth game in a row.</p>
        <p>Luis Gonzalez broke out of a 2-for-25 slump with a single and a two-run double in a seven-run fifth inning that helped Arizona complete the three-game sweep.</p>
        <p>Steve Finley had a two-run single, while Damian Miller and Tony Womack each had R.B.I. doubles in the uprising for Arizona, which had a six-run second inning in Saturday's 10-5 victory.</p>
        <p>Stottlemyre (6-1) allowed one run and seven hits in five and two-thirds innings to join teammate Randy Johnson (7-0) and Darryl Kile of St. Louis (6-1) as the National League's only six-game winners.</p>
        <p>Stottlemyre, who pitches with a partially torn rotator cuff after coming back from the injury without surgery last season, struck out seven, his most in two seasons with Arizona. He walked two and hit a batter.</p>
        <p>REDS 9, CARDINALS 7: Ken Griffey Jr. hit his second decisive homer of the series, a two-run shot in the sixth inning that gave host Cincinnati the victory.</p>
        <p>Griffey's ninth homer completed a four-run rally off Darren Holmes (0-1) and provided the final lead change in a back-and-forth game that turned on homers.</p>
        <p>Eric Davis hit his 11th career grand slam off Denny Neagle (4-0) as St. Louis overcame a three-run deficit and went ahead 6-3 in the fifth. The left-hander also gave up a solo shot to Eli Marrero in his worst outing of the season -- seven runs in six innings.</p>
        <p>But Rick Ankiel couldn't find his control and the Cardinals' bullpen couldn't hold the lead.</p>
        <p>Ankiel threw four wild pitches, one of them a breaking ball that barely made the dirt cutout in front of home plate. The left-hander also walked four and gave up a two-run homer to Dante Bichette that started the Reds' comeback in the fifth.</p>
        <p>Trailing 7-5, the Reds sent eight batters to the plate in the sixth off Holmes, who was making his first appearance since the Cardinals signed him as a free agent from Arizona last Thursday.</p>
        <p>BREWERS 9, EXPOS 4: Jose Hernandez hit a homer and a two-run single as host Milwaukee broke out of its offensive slump.</p>
        <p>The Brewers, who entered the game with a majors-worst .227 team batting average, snapped a three-game losing streak and ripped Dustin Hermanson (3-3) for the biggest offensive outburst of their 10-game homestand, which they finished 3-7.</p>
        <p>Milwaukee got two-run hits from Ron Belliard, Hernandez and Kevin Barker while jumping to a 7-2 lead after the fourth inning. Belliard finished with three runs batted in.</p>
        <p>At 11-20, the Brewers are still off to their worst start since 1970, their first year in Milwaukee.</p>
        <p>Hernandez went 3 for 4 in his first multihit game since April 12. He signed a three-year, $10 million free-agent contract in the off-season but had a horrible April as the Brewers' everyday third baseman.</p>
        <p>He had one extra-base hit -- a homer -- and a .170 average entering the game. His 405-foot blast to left in the fifth was one of the longer homers at County Stadium this year.</p>
        <p>ASTROS 14, DODGERS 8: Jeff Shaw hit Richard Hidalgo with the bases loaded to force in the go-ahead run and Roger Cedeno added a three-run homer in a seven-run 10th inning as Houston beat Los Angeles.</p>
        <p>Mitch Melsukey led the Astros' 17-hit attack with a career-high five hits, including a two-run single in the 10th.</p>
        <p>Billy Wagner (1-1) was the winner, retiring all four batters he faced after entering the game with the bases loaded in the eighth.</p>
        <p>Shaw hit Hidalgo after walking Ken Caminiti.</p>
        <p>Lance Berkman, who hit a tying homer off Shaw with two outs in the ninth Friday night, followed with a bloop R.B.I. single over a drawn-in infield to give the Astros a 9-7 lead.</p>
        <p>Melsukey drove in two more with a single off Alan Mills, and Cedeno followed with his second homer of the season.</p>
