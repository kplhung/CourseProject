        <p>The newest crop of workers may be less concerned than had been thought on the high salaries and stock options.</p>
        <p>In a survey to be released today by WetFeet.com, an online recruiting and career site, 869 undergraduate and graduate students from more than 50 colleges and universities around the country were asked to rank their priorities in making career decisions.</p>
        <p>Challenging work topped the list of important factors. It was followed closely by solid ''training for future work.'' Third in ranking came ''good colleagues/boss.'' Salary was fourth. Stock option packages fell to the bottom, along with ''ability to dress casually'' and ''no weekend work.''</p>
        <p>''Even in today's economy, where it seems everyone is going after the Internet gold rush, people are looking at their career decisions very carefully and are weighing other factors as more important than salary and stock options in their career decision,'' said Stephen Pollock, president of WetFeet.com.</p>
        <p>Mr. Pollock said he found the results particularly striking because the survey was in February and March, when the stock market was still flying high.</p>
        <p>''Even before the recent volatility in the stock market, students show they're very thoughtful about their career choices,'' Mr. Pollock said.</p>
        <p>WetFeet.com, based in San Francisco, hired Q &amp; A Research, a research firm in Novato, Calif., to conduct the online survey. Survey participants were drawn from users of the WetFeet.com site as well as other career and educational Web sites.</p>
