        <p>For children who need medical attention at hospitals, the danger may not end when they are placed in ambulances.</p>
        <p>A recent study by researchers at Johns Hopkins Children's Center found that it was not uncommon for patients and medical equipment to be unsecured as ambulances sped to the hospital.</p>
        <p>The findings, part of an effort to improve ambulance safety, were presented this month in Boston at a meeting of the Pediatric Academic Societies and the American Academy of Pediatrics.</p>
        <p>Dr. Nadine R. Levick, an emergency medical specialist at Johns Hopkins, emphasized that the findings were not an indictment of ambulance safety. The goal of the study, she said, was to assess conditions in the typical ambulance.</p>
        <p>With that information in hand, a team of doctors and engineers, supported by the federal government, intend to design tests, complete with crash-test dummies, similar to those used to assess the safety of passenger vehicles.</p>
        <p>''The feeling is, anything we can do to make this a safer environment is a plus,'' Dr. Levick said.</p>
        <p>Ambulances have a high crash rate per mile traveled, but the crashes tend to be minor, Dr. Levick said.</p>
        <p>In the study, researchers observed 200 ambulance arrivals at an unidentified urban hospital involving 206 patients and 636 other occupants. The observers found that in 11 percent of the cases, patients on gurneys were not strapped in at all. Ten percent traveled on a parent's lap. And many types of emergency medical service equipment were found to be either poorly secured or not tied down at all.</p>
