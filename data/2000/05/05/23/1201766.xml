        <p>The Supreme Court took a step back today from its continuing confrontation with Congress over the boundaries of federal authority, interpreting two federal laws in a manner that avoided the need to rule on challenges to the statutes' constitutionality.</p>
        <p>The court unanimously interpreted the federal arson law as not applying to arson of a house used solely as a private residence. A man sentenced to 35 years in federal prison for throwing a Molotov cocktail into a cousin's house had challenged his conviction on the ground that Congress's power to regulate interstate commerce did not extend to making such an act a federal crime. The justices today vacated the conviction on the narrower, purely statutory ground that the law ''does not reach an owner-occupied residence that is not used for any commercial purpose.''</p>
        <p>In a second case, the court ruled that Congress did not intend to make the states liable to suit by private plaintiffs under the False Claims Act, a federal law that allows individuals to sue on the government's behalf for claims of fraud in government contracting.</p>
        <p>This 7-to-2 decision avoided the deeper constitutional issue of whether states are immune from such suits under the 11th Amendment, which the court has invoked several times recently to shield state governments from the application of federal law.</p>
        <p>However, in a sign that the justices are by no means finished with their examination of the limits of congressional authority, the court accepted a new and potentially far-reaching case about federal authority for decision in its next term.</p>
        <p>The new case is a challenge to federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act over isolated wetlands, including seasonal ponds and small lakes that are not connected to navigable interstate waterways but serve as habitats for migratory birds. A regional solid waste agency in Cook County, Ill., which was denied a permit from the Army Corps of Engineers to fill in such a wetland for use as a waste disposal site, is arguing that Congress lacks authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate such areas.</p>
        <p>According to a brief filed in the case by the National Association of Homebuilders, there are 8.3 million isolated wetlands in the country. Under its regulations, the Army Corps of Engineers, which has the authority to issue permits under the Clean Water Act, broadly defines the waters under its jurisdiction to include ''intrastate lakes, rivers, streams,'' as well as prairie potholes, wet meadows, and ponds, and including waters used by migratory birds that cross state lines.</p>
        <p>In denying the Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County permission to fill 17.6 acres, which included seasonally wet depressions left from a former strip mining operation, the Army Corps of Engineers said there were numerous migratory birds nesting at or using the site, including a large colony of great blue herons.</p>
        <p>The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, in Chicago, upheld the corps's position in a ruling last year that noted the cumulative effect on the economy of the ''millions of people'' who hunt, trap, or observe migratory birds. Even if there is no effect on commerce from the destruction of a particular isolated habitat, the court said, ''the aggregate effect is clear, and that is all the Commerce Clause requires.''</p>
        <p>However, the soundness of that analysis is in fact far from clear following the Supreme Court's decision last week that struck down the civil remedy provision of the Violence Against Women Act on the ground that violence against women lacked a sufficient connection with commerce. The justices received appeal in the new case, Solid Waste Agency v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, No. 99-1178, in January but deferred acting on it until after deciding the Violence Against Women Act case.</p>
        <p>Of the two federalism cases the court decided today, the result in the False Claims Act case was the more surprising because the court itself, in an unexpected order on the eve of argument in November, had greatly raised the constitutional stakes. The court asked the lawyers to address the question of whether a private individual has standing to pursue a False Claims Act suit on behalf of the government. Had the answer been no, the heart of a law that Congress first passed in 1863 to curb fraud against the government by Civil War contractors would have been eliminated.</p>
        <p>But having opened the door to that prospect, the court shut it firmly today. The court was unanimous in ruling that private plaintiffs do have standing, both because of the long historic pedigree of what are known as ''qui tam'' actions and because the plaintiff is standing in the shoes of the government, which has suffered an actual injury.</p>
        <p>Justice Antonin Scalia wrote the court's opinion in this case, Vermont Agency of Natural Resources v. Stevens, No. 98-1828. A former employee of the Vermont state agency had brought a False Claims Act suit charging that the agency had mishandled a federal grant. In response, Vermont argued that under the 11th Amendment, which the court has interpreted as barring suits in federal court against states, the state was immune from suit. Both the Federal District Court in Vermont and the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in New York, rejected the state's position.</p>
        <p>The court today avoided the 11th Amendment issue, ruling instead that the act's reference to the liability of ''any person'' who commits fraud against the government does not refer to states, at least when the plaintiff is a private individual. The government has the authority to take over the prosecuting role in a False Claims Act case, and the decision today left open the prospect that the government itself could still sue a state. The decision also raised the possibility that the False Claims Act could be open to other constitutional challenges based on the separation of powers.</p>
        <p>In a dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Justice David H. Souter, said the law's text ''makes it perfectly clear'' that Congress intended the word ''person'' to include states.</p>
        <p>Both in this case and in the arson case, Jones v. United States, No. 99-5739, the court applied a longstanding rule that laws of dubious constitutionality should be interpreted, if possible, in a way that avoids the constitutional issue.</p>
        <p>In applying that rule in the arson case, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's unanimous opinion said that ''arson is a paradigmatic common-law state crime'' that Congress could not casually have meant to federalize without saying so explicitly. The law ''is not soundly read to make virtually every arson in the country a federal offense,'' Justice Ginsburg said.</p>
        <p>The Clinton administration defended the law's broad application on the ground that private homes were connected to interstate commerce through their receipt of natural gas through interstate lines as well as through the interstate mortgage and insurance markets. The Seventh Circuit accepted this analysis when it upheld Dewey J. Jones's conviction. But Justice Ginsburg said the analysis defied the ''common perception'' of what it means to ''use'' something in interstate commerce. Here, the owner simply ''used the property as his home, the center of his family life,'' she said.</p>
