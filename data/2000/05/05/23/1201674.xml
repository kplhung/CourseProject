        <p>First it was mice that could eat to their hearts' content without getting fat. Now it's mice that can hold their alcohol better and recover from it faster.</p>
        <p>First, scientists at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey reported that they had created a genetically modified mouse that could eat with abandon. The long-term objective is better understanding of human obesity.</p>
        <p>Now, scientists at the University of Washington report creating a mouse that drinks much more alcohol than it would ordinarily. The goal here is more insight into alcoholism.</p>
        <p>The researchers say they have bred mice missing a gene that bears instructions for making an important brain protein. The mice, they say, drink twice as much alcohol as do mice with the protein.</p>
        <p>And, given injections of alcohol raising blood-alcohol level to almost three times the driving limit, the mice recovered in about 65 minutes. (Ordinary mice needed about 90.) The findings were reported in a recent issue of The Journal of Neuroscience.</p>
