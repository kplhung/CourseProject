        <p>Officially, Hillary Rodham Clinton, the Senate candidate, took a night off tonight. But Mrs. Clinton did not lounge on the sofa at home in Chappaqua, N.Y., with a good book or soak her tired feet in a White House tub.</p>
        <p>Instead, Mrs. Clinton's first lady incarnation was dancing and dining and toasting at a state dinner for  President Thabo Mbeki of South Africa and his wife, Zanele.</p>
        <p>Although Mrs. Clinton has reduced her first lady duties since starting her New York Senate campaign, the White House social office has remained up and running, providing Mrs. Clinton with a series of marquee social occasions to break up the monotony of the campaign trail. Campaign food is a long way from the saffron pistachio couscous, apricot ginger glazed lamb and cape gooseberries that were served tonight in a large tent on the South Lawn to accommodate a larger-than-usual crowd.</p>
        <p>Her campaign staffers play down the importance of Mrs. Clinton's duties as first lady in her effort to replace Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, who is retiring. It will be her stances on health care and education and other issues of importance to New Yorkers, they say, that will determine the election results, not which heads of state she welcomes to the State Dining Room.</p>
        <p>But the dinners, which receive scant attention outside Washington, do give Mrs. Clinton the opportunity to reward loyalists in her campaign  with coveted invitations.</p>
        <p>In February, at a dinner for the king and queen of Spain, Mrs. Clinton invited her campaign scheduler, Evan Ryan, but there were few obvious campaign backers among the diners.</p>
        <p>Tonight, however, many New Yorkers, most of them African-American, received embossed invitations. These included Floyd H. Flake, the pastor of the Allen A.M.E. Church in Queens, who had just endorsed Mrs. Clinton, and William A. Johnson Jr., the mayor of Rochester, who has campaigned at her side.</p>
        <p>C. Virginia Fields, the Manhattan borough president, attended, as did  David N. Dinkins, the former mayor, and New York Representatives Charles B. Rangel, Gregory W. Meeks and Louise M. Slaughter. Other New Yorkers in attendance included the director Spike Lee, State Comptroller H. Carl McCall and Howard Rubin, chairman of the computer science department at Hunter College.</p>
        <p>Although state dinners rarely make the nightly news, they are followed closely in the nation's capital. The guest lists are published in The Washington Post, and reporters in dark evening attire stand in the grand foyer of the White House for glimpses of the official receiving line, the toasts and the entertainment.</p>
        <p>Tonight, the concert pianist Awadagin Pratt performed. Mrs. Clinton decided upon gold base plates, creme china with a gold band and gold flatwear on peach chamois tablecloths made of satin for the table settings.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rangel said some of Mrs. Clinton's duties as first lady do help her campaign, but they are the substantive issue-oriented duties, not the social ones.</p>
        <p>''Co-hosting a dinner is just not that newsworthy,'' he said. ''If I were the campaign manager and there was a chance to talk to some women in Westchester or attend a state dinner, she'd be in Westchester.''</p>
        <p>Even among African-Americans, Mr. Rangel said, Mrs. Clinton's attendance at a dinner for Nelson Mandela's successor would attract scant attention.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Clinton did emerge from tonight's dinner with something more tangible than the goodwill of some supporters. Her South African counterpart gave her a 12-piece set of napkin rings in the shape of African animals. There was a lion, an elephant, a leopard and, perhaps most important for campaigning strategy, a buffalo.</p>
