        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Re ''A Coach Beyond Punishment'' (editorial, May 16): Far from being ''beyond punishment,'' Bob Knight must now operate under the strictest code of conduct of any coach in the nation.</p>
        <p>Clearly, many in the media would have been satisfied only with his dismissal. That may have been the easier course, but not necessarily the right one. We acknowledge that the university has not done enough to hold Knight accountable; that will now change.</p>
        <p>Why does he deserve another chance? Because he has made many valuable contributions to Indiana University. Many former players tell of the positive, lasting effect Knight has had on their lives.</p>
        <p>If he can build on those successes, while avoiding the embarrassing outbursts that are also part of his legacy, he will remain our basketball coach. If he cannot, he will be dismissed. We believe that is a fair solution.</p>
        <p>MYLES BRAND  President, Indiana University  Bloomington, Ind., May 22, 2000</p>
