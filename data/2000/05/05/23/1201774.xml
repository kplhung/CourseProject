      <block class="lead_paragraph">
        <p>By a narrow, 5-to-4 margin, the Supreme Court yesterday struck down, on ''basic'' free-speech grounds, a federal law that sought to protect children by requiring many cable systems to limit sexually explicit channels to the late night hours. It was a wise extension of a longstanding judicial tradition to protect speech that, in the words of Justice Anthony Kennedy, ''many citizens may find shabby, offensive or even ugly.''</p>
        <p>Justice Kennedy and his colleagues in the majority -- John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg -- did not quarrel with the Congressional goal of shielding children from inappropriate material. But much to their credit, they did not let the law's laudable purpose, or the fact that the restriction was less than a total ban, exempt the government from having to use the least restrictive way of achieving its goal.</p>

        <p>By a narrow, 5-to-4 margin, the Supreme Court yesterday struck down, on ''basic'' free-speech grounds, a federal law that sought to protect children by requiring many cable systems to limit sexually explicit channels to the late night hours. It was a wise extension of a longstanding judicial tradition to protect speech that, in the words of Justice Anthony Kennedy, ''many citizens may find shabby, offensive or even ugly.''</p>
        <p>Justice Kennedy and his colleagues in the majority -- John Paul Stevens, David Souter, Clarence Thomas and Ruth Bader Ginsburg -- did not quarrel with the Congressional goal of shielding children from inappropriate material. But much to their credit, they did not let the law's laudable purpose, or the fact that the restriction was less than a total ban, exempt the government from having to use the least restrictive way of achieving its goal.</p>
        <p>Section 505 of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, which effectively limited sexually oriented programs to late-night hours, was adopted in response to complaints about the ''signal bleed'' that sometimes occurs when such programs, though scrambled to prevent viewing by non-subscribers, nonetheless get through. But another section of the law already required cable operators to provide an effective blocking device free upon a customer's request, providing a far less restrictive alternative than barring constitutionally protected material from broadcast during the daytime.</p>
        <p>The decision marked the first time that the Supreme Court has applied ''strict scrutiny'' -- the highest level of First Amendment protection -- to cable programming. In doing so, the court signaled a promising reluctance to allow the government to regulate content in the newer communications technologies. The ruling showed that it is possible to protect both children and freedom of speech.</p>
