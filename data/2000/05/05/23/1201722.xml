        <p>Microsoft filed an unexpected brief with a federal judge today that quoted from a five-year-old government legal document in which the Justice Department argued that breaking up Microsoft would be ''against the public interest'' and ''dangerous to the economy's welfare.''</p>
        <p>The document was part of the public record from an older antitrust case against Microsoft, the Justice Department's first suit against the company. The nine-page brief gives Microsoft the final word before a hearing on Wednesday but risks irritating the judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, who did not ask for another filing from Microsoft when he laid out the schedule for the remedy phase of the case.</p>
        <p>Under the schedule set by Judge Jackson in April, the Justice Department and 17 states filed a brief with the court on April 28 asking the judge to break Microsoft into two companies as the remedy for the illegal behavior found in the long antitrust trial. Then, 12 days later, Microsoft responded with its own proposal, a short list of narrow restrictions on its behavior, while denouncing the government's plan.</p>
        <p>Last Wednesday, the Justice Department filed a reply to Microsoft's brief, saying the company's proposal was ''a cosmetic remedy'' of no real worth. That was to have been the last filing. But a Microsoft spokesman, Jim Cullinan, said the company ''believes it is appropriate for the company to have a reply to focus on a few issues raised in the government's last brief.''</p>
        <p>While citing the old Justice Department documents, Microsoft also repeated several legal arguments it had made previously. Among them, the company stated that the courts have never broken up a company for antitrust violations; all previous breakups have been a result of settlements of antitrust suits. ''For all its sophistry in discussing the case law, the government fails to identify a single precedent for its radical breakup proposal,'' Microsoft wrote.</p>
        <p>The Justice Department did not respond to Microsoft's filing, but a lawyer who is close to the government's current case said it ''relies on statements made before Microsoft had engaged in the numerous illegal acts found in the current case.''</p>
        <p>The legal document quoted in the Microsoft brief came from the Justice Department's first antitrust suit against Microsoft, which was resolved in 1995. That case was settled when Microsoft accepted several behavioral restrictions.</p>
        <p>Under a law known as the Tunney Act, any settlement of an antitrust suit must be put up for public comment before the judge can decide whether to approve it. And much of the industry comment then was disparaging; executives called the proposed settlement inadequate and argued that Microsoft ought to be broken up instead.</p>
        <p>Responding to those public comments, the Justice Department filed the brief Microsoft quoted today. In it the government's economist then, Kenneth J. Arrow of Stanford University, wrote that breakup remedies ''designed to return the market to equilibrium'' are ''likely to be of the form of penalizing whatever firm happens to be leading, Microsoft in this case.''</p>
        <p>Today, the lawyer who is close to the government's case said, ''That Microsoft repeatedly violated the law after the previous proceeding demonstrates why structural relief is necessary now.''</p>
