        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>It is not surprising that the National Rifle Association has chosen New York City as a possible location for its theme restaurant (news article, May 20).</p>
        <p>The N.R.A. has always had New York City in its sights because we have the toughest gun licensing and registration laws in the country, and these laws work. Most guns used in crimes in New York are bought in states with lax laws.</p>
        <p>The N.R.A. rhetoric about not needing national laws or standards to control the distribution of guns doesn't sell here. The group needs to try other methods to persuade New Yorkers that guns are fun; thus the idea for gun-related entertainment.</p>
        <p>New Yorkers won't be taken in by the rhetoric. We suggest that the N.R.A. take its violent theme restaurant elsewhere.</p>
        <p>BARBARA HOHLT  New York, May 20, 2000</p>
        <p>The writer is chairwoman of New Yorkers Against Gun Violence.</p>
