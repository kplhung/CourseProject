        <p>To the Editor:</p>
        <p>Joe Rosenthal's photograph of the flag-raising on Iwo Jima on Feb. 23, 1945 (Arts pages, May 17), speaks for itself. As I noted in The Saturday Evening Post 53 years ago, the first report of that event was also dramatic.</p>
        <p>I was a member of the intelligence staff of the Third Marine Division, which was on shipboard still in reserve that day. My job was to keep current a situation map of the struggle ashore. Among the reports our radio intercepted were those from an observer in a light plane that constantly circled over the battlefield. He would report anything of significance, locating it on the map by target area. For example, a message would read, ''TA 182-L, two of our tanks firing into caves,'' or ''TA 183-H, six of our men  crawling on a ridge.''</p>
        <p>Around midmorning our radioman handed me a message that read ''TA 132-P,'' which I located on the map as the summit of Mount Suribachi. Turning back to finish the message, I read, ''One flag -- red, white and blue.''</p>
