        <p>THE REPUBLICANS</p>
        <p>KEYES FIRM ON ABORTION  The abortion issue continues to present potential problems for the Republican Party, with Alan Keyes, a presidential candidate, considering leaving the party if it weakens its stance against abortion. Connie Hair, Mr. Keyes's press secretary, says he will possibly join the Constitution Party and seek its nomination if the Republicans do not retain a strong anti-abortion position in their platform or if Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, the presumed Republican presidential nominee, picks a running mate who is not anti-abortion. The Constitution Party is strongly anti-abortion. Ms. Hair made her comments to USA Today over the weekend, then elaborated on them yesterday. Mr. Keyes has not been heard from much lately. But Ms. Hair emphasized that while Mr. Keyes reserved the right to abandon the Republican Party over the abortion issue, he was for the moment still a candidate for the Republican nomination, had delegates pledged to him and intended to attend the party convention in Philadelphia. The Constitution Party already has a presidential candidate, Howard Phillips, who said yesterday, ''I am prepared to discuss anything with Alan Keyes, including the possibility of his becoming our candidate for president or vice president, but my present intention is to continue as the presidential nominee.''</p>

        <p>THE GREENS</p>
        <p>NADER PRO-IMPEACHMENT  Ralph Nader, the probable Green Party candidate for president, said yesterday that if he had been in the Senate during the impeachment trial of President Clinton, he would have voted to convict. ''I thought that he crossed that boundary so seriously in that scandal that the House was proper in impeaching him and the Senate really should have convicted him,'' Mr. Nader said on Political Points, the Webcast of The New York Times and ABC News. ''I think law licenses have been taken away from lawyers for less egregious offenses than what President Clinton committed as president of the United States.'' While the remark might please some disaffected Democrats and independent voters, it could also anger some of the liberals Mr. Nader has been courting in states like California, where a recent poll shows him pulling just under 10 percent of the vote.</p>

        <p>THE STATES</p>
        <p>UP FOR GRABS  Smelling vulnerability in the Republican incumbent, four Arkansas Democrats each hope to be selected in today's primary to be the challenger in the state's traditionally Democratic Fourth Congressional District. Representative Jay Dickey has represented the district, which is about a quarter black, since 1992, but polls have shown he is faltering, particularly after a remark he made in January suggesting that he could not help a group of black farmers unless they contributed money. The leading Democrat in today's primary, State Senator Mike Ross, is the only one of the group that outranked Mr. Dickey in a recent poll by The Arkansas Democrat-Gazette. The poll showed Mr. Ross leading his nearest competitor, former State Representative Judy Smith, by 21 points.</p>

        <p>THE SENATE</p>
        <p>KENNEDY CHALLENGER REBOUNDS  A Republican who plans to challenge Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, in the November election appeared to cross a crucial threshold today, gaining the 10,000 signatures he needed to get his name on the ballot. The Republican, Jack E. Robinson, turned in at least 10,073 certified signatures to city and town clerks, Secretary of State William Galvin said. Mr. Galvin said it was not certain that Mr. Robinson would appear on the ballot because some of the signatures could be disqualified. Mr. Robinson, whose campaign has been plagued by problems, said the latest development vindicated his faith in the face of  naysayers who predicted he would not break the 10,000 mark. ''We knew we would pull it off,'' he said.</p>
