        <p>The Exxon Mobil Corporation is conducting a review for the combined account of what the company calls its fuels marketing portfolio, which includes service stations and convenience stores. Billings were estimated at $100 million.</p>
        <p>Lauren Kerr, a spokeswoman for Exxon Mobil in Fairfax, Va., confirmed a report of the review this week in Advertising Age. The review is taking place regionally, she said, depending on the needs of the company's five regional markets: Asia-Pacific, Africa and the Middle East, Europe, North America and South America (including the Caribbean). One or more agencies could be named to handle the account, Ms. Kerr said.</p>

        <p>Lauren Kerr, a spokeswoman for Exxon Mobil in Fairfax, Va., confirmed a report of the review this week in Advertising Age.

One or more agencies could be named to handle the account, Ms. Kerr said.</p>
        <p>The two incumbent agencies are taking part in the review, which had been expected since the merger last year of Exxon and Mobil to form Exxon Mobil. One is DDB Worldwide in New York, part of the Omnicom Group, which had handled the Mobil account since 1949, and the other is the Houston office of McCann-Erickson Worldwide Advertising, which had handled the account of Exxon and its predecessors since 1912. McCann-Erickson, which also handles the Esso brand outside the United States, is part of the McCann-Erickson World Group, a unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies.</p>
