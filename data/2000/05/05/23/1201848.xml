        <p>His arm still in the release position, Rasheed Wallace posed for an extra moment as he fired another 3-pointer at the bewildered Los Angeles Lakers tonight. A Game 2 smile had replaced Wallace's Game 1 scowl, and with that the Portland Trail Blazers convincingly stole the home-court advantage in the Western Conference finals.</p>
        <p>Wallace drilled three 3-point baskets, and he and Steve Smith each scored 11 points during a decisive third quarter that lifted the Trail Blazers to a 106-77 victory and tied the four-of-seven-game series at one game apiece.</p>
        <p>''His focus was great,'' Portland Coach Mike Dunleavy said of Wallace. ''It was nice to have Rasheed in there for the full ride.''</p>
        <p>Game 3 is Friday night in Portland, which gives the Lakers plenty of time to reflect on an 8-point third quarter, which tied the franchise's worst quarter in playoff history.</p>
        <p>Wallace had playoff career highs of 29 points and 12 rebounds, and Scottie Pippen added 21 points and 11 rebounds for Portland.</p>
        <p>Shaquille O'Neal led the Lakers with 23 points and 12 rebounds, but 14 of his points came in the fourth quarter, when the Lakers never got closer than 18.</p>
        <p>The Trail Blazers buried the Lakers in the third quarter, outscoring them by 28-8. The assault began in earnest at 6 minutes 48 seconds, after Dunleavy earned technical foul while protesting a call that gave Arvydas Sabonis his fourth foul. From there, the Trail Blazers took off on a 22-6 run.</p>
        <p>Trailing by 56-51, the Lakers went nearly six minutes without scoring, finally getting 2 points on free throws by Kobe Bryant with 1.3 seconds left.</p>
        <p>''They put us on our heels defensively,'' Lakers Coach Phil Jackson said. ''They pounded the ball inside, drove to the basket and created shots. We got ragged there in the third quarter. Morale-wise, we just fell off.''</p>
        <p>Game 2 resembled a playground grudge match rather than a downtown ballet as the Trail Blazers took a 48-45 lead in a first half highlighted by the foul problems of O'Neal and  Sabonis.</p>
        <p>The Lakers' concerns were magnified the moment Bonzi Wells drove to the basket with 6:20 left in the second quarter. Wells made the shot and was smacked by O'Neal, who was immediately whistled for his third foul. Wells made the free throw to give the Trail Blazers a 34-30 lead. O'Neal, who was held to 6 points in 17 minutes, played about another minute, before being taken out for the rest of the half.</p>
        <p>''I can't say enough of how our big guys handled Shaq,'' Pippen said. ''They played him close and fouled him when they had to. We took it to them tonight.''</p>
        <p>At 5:16, Sabonis also headed for the bench after bumping O'Neal too hard under the basket. Sabonis easily surpassed his effort in Game 1 on Saturday night (no points, one rebound) with 5 points and 4 rebounds in only 9 minutes tonight.</p>
        <p>After attempting no foul shots in the first half of Game 1, the Blazers  suddenly appeared more frequently at the free-throw line. They earned 25 free throws and made 18 tonight. Pippen led Portland with 17 points in the first half and Wallace had 12.</p>
        <p>Making 7 of 11 free-throw attempts, the Lakers were fortunate to trail by only 3 points at halftime. Bryant scored 10 points and Ron Harper added 6.</p>
        <p>After a slow start, the Lakers grabbed a 23-22 first-quarter lead behind Harper's 7 points and A. C. Green's 6. The Lakers finished the quarter shooting 43 percent compared with Portland's 35 percent.</p>
        <p>The Trail Blazers got a timely boost from Wallace, who was ejected in the third quarter of Game 1 after contributing 11 points. Wallace came out with a new attitude tonight and scored 6 points in the first quarter.</p>
        <p>''I went out there with enthusiasm and attack mode,'' Wallace said.</p>
        <p>His play complemented that of Pippen, who had 8 points in the quarter.</p>
        <p>''The pressure is still on them because they still have to defend their home court,'' Pippen said before the game.</p>
        <p>Greg Anthony added: ''We're not feeling as bad as a lot of people think. This is a veteran team.''</p>
        <p>The Trail Blazers jumped to an 8-0 lead, scoring on their first four possessions, but their shooting quickly cooled. The Lakers tied the score at 14-14 on Harper's 3-pointer with 3:37 left. Bryant followed with another 3-pointer to give the Lakers their first lead at 17-14.</p>
