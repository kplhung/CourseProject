        <p>After a long delay, the New York City Partnership is finally preparing to award bonuses to teachers and principals in six Brooklyn schools where test scores improved during the 1998-99 school year. The Partnership, a business group, began the bonus program in District 19, in East New York, and expanded it to District 23, in Brownsville, this year.</p>

        <p>After a long delay, the New York City Partnership is finally preparing to award bonuses to teachers and principals in six Brooklyn schools where test scores improved during the 1998-99 school year. The Partnership, a business group, began the bonus program in District 19, in East New York, and expanded it to District 23, in Brownsville, this year.</p>
        <p>Board of Education officials said the awards were nearly a year late because state and city standardized tests, the basis for judging improvement, changed last year, making it difficult to compare scores. Teachers at five schools will receive bonuses of $1,000 because their schools were among the top 25 percent in terms of improved test scores. The principals of those schools will receive $5,500. Teachers at a sixth school will receive $2,000 each because their school was among the top 5 percent in its category. The principal there will receive $15,000.</p>
