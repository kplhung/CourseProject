        <p>The player whose postseason career is tethered to New York was asked today to clarify a comment he made. Yes, Reggie Miller said on the eve of the Eastern Conference finals, he ''hates but respects'' the Knicks.</p>
        <p>''I just don't like 'em,'' he said. ''I respect 'em. What's wrong with that?</p>
        <p>''I just think they always think they're bigger and badder than everyone. They really don't want to give no one else respect. And we know they don't give us no respect.</p>
        <p>''So why should I give respect or like someone that doesn't give us respect?''</p>
        <p>A year older but no less villainous, Miller is back in search of the big-game reputation he lost last June at Madison Square Garden.</p>
        <p>Miller will turn 35 in August. Much like his coach, Larry Bird, at the end of his Hall of Fame career, Miller has undergone the same scrutiny from critics who believed his days as a legitimate National Basketball Association star were over.</p>
        <p>And, like Bird, Miller has shut them up with huge shots and gaudy numbers that belie his age.</p>
        <p>Through 10 postseason games, he is averaging 25 points, making 49 percent of his shots and almost 40 percent of his 3-pointers. When the Pacers' season was at stake against the Milwaukee Bucks in the first round, Miller dropped 41 points on the Bucks in Game 5.</p>
        <p>He followed up that clutch showing with a 40-point effort against the Philadelphia 76ers in Game 1 of the semifinal series, a game in which Jalen Rose also scored 40. Miller has made 26  3-pointers since the regular season ended and 52 of 57 free throws.</p>
        <p>In the mid-1990's, the news media often used a popular beer advertisement to convey his playoff prowess. The last few seasons, it has almost became a tired cliche. But the more he keeps shooting down youngsters like Ray Allen and Allen Iverson, the more apropos ''Miller Time'' again begins to sound.</p>
        <p>Miller had just finished practice at Conseco Fieldhouse today, the day before Game 1 of the sixth Knicks-Pacers playoff installment in the last eight years.</p>
        <p>His ultracasual ensemble -- the tan fisherman's hat pulled down to his black designer shades, an oversize plaid-collar shirt and baggy shorts -- suggested he was waiting on the Miami Heat. But he wanted the Knicks. Anything else seemed to sabotage the script.</p>
        <p>''Of course, I wanted to play New York,'' Miller said. ''Like I said after Philly in Game 6, I think we need to exorcise some demons.</p>
        <p>''We have beaten New York, but it's never been in a conference finals. Detroit had to get by Boston. Chicago had to get by Detroit. So, there's always those teams you have to get by to move on to the next level. And New York is that team for us.''</p>
        <p>Miller has used more than his mouth and his deep 3-pointers to express his desire lately. In Game 4 against the 76ers, he responded to a second flagrant foul by 76ers center Matt Geiger with a lunging, two-handed shove to Geiger's face. The league construed Miller's reaction as a punch, and he was fined and suspended for Game 5. Geiger received a two-game suspension.</p>
        <p>Upset that his outburst cost the Pacers a game, Miller returned in Game 6 to knock the 76ers out on their home floor. Taunting venomous fans, throwing death stares at the 76ers bench, the player who once wrote a book entitled ''I Love Being the Enemy'' had succeeded in making another American city revile his every breath.</p>
        <p>No place dislikes Miller more than Manhattan, however.</p>
        <p>Between 1993 and 1999, the two teams have met five times in the playoffs. Twice the Knicks went through Indiana to make it to the N.B.A. finals. But if the Knicks have inflicted pain on Miller's career, he has also extracted emotional hurt from the Knicks.</p>
        <p>The three most memorable moments are part of Madison Square Garden lore. In 1994, he detonated for 25 of his 39 points in the fourth quarter of Game 5, giving the Pacers a 3-2 series lead. The Knicks, however, won in seven games.</p>
        <p>In Game 1 of their 1995 semifinal meeting, he outdid himself. With shocking suddenness, Miller scored  8 points in the final 18.7 seconds of the game, including two 3-pointers within 3.1 seconds of each other to knot the score at 105-105 and wipe out a 6-point Knicks lead. The Pacers won the series in seven games.</p>
        <p>His last great Garden moment came in Game 4 of the 1998 Eastern semifinals, when he let fly a 3-point bomb in front of a screaming Spike Lee with 5.9 seconds left, a shot that sent the game into overtime. The Pacers won the series in five games.</p>
        <p>''Probably the best would be the first time we ever did beat them in a series,'' Miller said, recalling the Pacers' 1995 triumph. ''But of course the worst is losing. You never like losing, but I hate losing to them.''</p>
        <p>He has faced off against Allan Houston for the last three years, losing the duel badly a year ago when the Pacers were stopped in six games. Miller shot an atrocious 3 for 18 in the deciding game, taking and missing only three shots in the final quarter. Houston took him outside and inside, bringing about a changing of the guard in the East.</p>
        <p>Whether Houston is nursing a badly sprained ankle from the Heat series or not, Miller is looking forward to redemption and to re-establishing himself as the conference's elite shooting guard. ''Even if he didn't have the hobbled ankle, I would still attack him,'' he said.</p>
        <p>Miller also has the motivation of perhaps his last contract for which to play. A free agent, his recent performances have essentially forced the franchise to begin seriously considering acquiescing to Miller's off-season demands. The graying team that Miller, Mark Jackson, Rik Smits and Chris Mullin play for was thought to be too old to make another run.</p>
        <p>''There's a lot of players that have been on vacation for about a month and a half now, watching the games from the Bahamas, Jamaica, Anguilla, Aruba, talking about, 'We played against those guys,' '' Miller said. ''So I'd rather be in this position than sipping a mai tai right now.''</p>
        <p>Bird said: ''I know he's looking forward to going back to New York. He loves to play there. The crowd will be going crazy, and Reggie loves the show time. That's what it's all about.''</p>
        <p>Bird was asked if he could ever feel the same contempt for the Knicks that Miller feels.</p>
        <p>He looked deadpan into the assembled gathering and said, ''It's hard for me to really be ticked off at a team that I have more championship rings than they do.''</p>
        <p>Like Miller, like Bird.</p>
