        <p>Some seven millenniums before the Christian era, on the western bank of the Euphrates River in what is now southern Iraq, there flourished the early cultures of Mesopotamia. By the third millennium, the most important of its city-states was the Sumerian city of Ur.

        <p>NEWS  Buried Treasure</p>
        <p>Some seven millenniums before the Christian era, on the western bank of the Euphrates River in what is now southern Iraq, there flourished the early cultures of Mesopotamia. By the third millennium, the most important of its city-states was the Sumerian city of Ur. In the most spectacular discovery of an expedition co-sponsored from 1922 to 1934 by the University of Pennsylvania Museum and the British Museum, archaeologists found 16 royal tombs, filled with masterpieces of Sumerian art. From Thursday through Sept. 10, in ''Treasures From the Royal Tombs of Ur,'' more than 250 objects, including jewelry in gold and semiprecious stones, ancient musical instruments and weapons in precious metals, will be exhibited at the Morgan Library.</p>
        <p>Through a Lens</p>
        <p>In 1941, for the first time, photographs became eligible for a Pulitzer Prize. In the years since, images that have defined eras have won the prize: Joe Rosenthal's photograph of the flag-raising on Iwo Jima (1945 Pulitzer), Robert H. Jackson's photograph of Jack Ruby shooting Lee Harvey Oswald (1964); Eddie Adams's photograph of the execution of a Vietcong prisoner (1969). Beginning today more than 100 spot news and feature prizewinners will be on view in ''The Pulitzer Prize Photographs: Capture the Moment'' at the Newseum/NY, 580 Madison Avenue, between 56th and 57th Streets. The show continues through Sept. 23.</p>
        <p>Summer Fun</p>
        <p>The ticket price is $5 or less. The attractions include the Mostly Mozart Festival, the New York City Ballet, jazz in Carnegie Hall, Mikhail Baryshnikov and the White Oak Dance Project at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, the Dance Theater of Harlem and much, much more. Beginning on Friday, under the auspices of High 5 Tickets to the Arts, more than 3,000 bargain-price tickets to concert halls, theaters and museums will go on sale to 13- to 18-year-olds at Ticketmaster outlets, including HMV Records, Tower Records, the Wiz and other stores in New York City and much of New Jersey.</p>
        <p>Wall Flowers</p>
        <p>Two years in the making, constructed of 1,579 tons of fieldstones, about 10 city blocks in length,  the sculptor Andy Goldsworthy's serpentine ''Wall That Went for a Walk (Storm King Wall),'' meanders between maples and oaks, crosses old farm roads, plunges into a pond and re-emerges on the landscape of Storm King Art Center in Mountainville, N.Y. From now through Nov. 15, the 500-acre center will be the site of ''Andy Goldsworthy at Storm King Art Center.'' The exhibition includes  the artist's proposal drawings for 'Storm King Wall,'' and an installation of gray clay that will change as the material dries.</p>
