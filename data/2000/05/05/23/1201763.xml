        <p>A lawyer for the plaintiffs in the punitive damages stage of a landmark case against cigarette makers stood before jurors today and slapped himself on the wrist, the punishment he said that tobacco executives felt they deserved for decades of misconduct.</p>
        <p>Cigarette makers want the country to believe that ''they are good boys and girls'' who have learned their lesson, said the lawyer, Stanley Rosenblatt, in opening statements in what could be a multibillion-dollar punitive judgment in Miami-Dade Circuit Court against top cigarette manufacturers.</p>
        <p>''Even if they have changed, that does not free them from paying for wrongful behavior for decades,'' said Mr. Rosenblatt, whose clients, three sick smokers who represent 300,000 to 500,000 Florida smokers, are seeking a $100 billion judgment.</p>
        <p>But Dan Webb, a lawyer for the country's largest cigarette maker, Philip Morris, told the jury in his opening statement that he would offer ''significant and compelling evidence'' that cigarette makers had changed, that they now recognized that cigarettes as a ''dangerous product'' that should not be marketed to teenagers.</p>
        <p>The jury that will now decide on punitive damages in the case has already found that cigarettes are a potentially deadly and addictive product and has already awarded $12.7 million in compensatory damages to the plaintiffs.</p>
        <p>Mr. Rosenblatt said in his opening statement that the cigarette makers had not really changed how they marketed their product. He said the defendants, which include Philip Morris Inc., R. J. Reynolds, Brown &amp; Williamson, the Lorillard Tobacco Company and Liggett Group Inc., still ''target youths and children.''</p>
        <p>He said cigarette makers are still running full-page ads in Rolling Stone and Entertainment Weekly, aimed at young people, and in other magazines aimed at women.</p>
        <p>Most smokers are men, and if the industry really wants only to maintain its business, why is it advertising in magazines mostly read by others? Mr. Rosenblatt asked.</p>
        <p>The industry's assertions that it has changed is a public relations ploy, he said. ''They're on the same page they've always been on.''</p>
        <p>But Mr. Webb argued that tobacco companies have changed.</p>
        <p>''The world has not stood still while you have been sitting as jurors,'' he told the panel of six jurors and six alternates who have been weighing evidence in various phases of the lawsuit for almost 20 months.</p>
        <p>Lawyers for tobacco companies are expected to argue that, after years of resisting scientific findings of the destructive nature of tobacco use, tobacco companies now accept that their product is addictive and harmful.</p>
        <p>Top executives have changed, Mr. Webb said, giving way to a new breed like Michael Szymanczyk, president and chief executive of Philip Morris, which manufacturers the country's best-selling brand, Marlboro.</p>
        <p>Mr. Szymanczyk believes tobacco ''is a dangerous product,'' but also ''a completely legal product.'' He said the company spends millions to discourage teenagers from smoking.</p>
        <p>He asked jurors to consider that the industry has changed, and reminded them that they do not have to award any punitive damages.</p>
        <p>Mr. Webb told the jury that the country's top five cigarette makers are committed to $254 billion in settlements with all 50 states over a 25-year period that ends in 2021.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Rosenblatt said the states do not have to give that money to smokers and that the industry has yet to pay ''10 cents'' to the people damaged by their product.</p>
        <p>''My wife's been on oxygen for eight years, has emphysema, and a brain tumor, and doctors told us it was from smoking,'' said Bill Herroin, a retiree who moved to Florida four years ago.</p>
        <p>He came to the courtroom with his wife, Frances Herroin. She sat quietly in a wheelchair, hooked to a respirator.</p>
        <p>Mr. Szymanczyk, in a deposition, said Philip Morris could not survive a judgment even half as large as the $100 billion listed in the lawsuit.</p>
        <p>''We would not be able to pay this money if it was due in 30 days, or in two years, for that matter,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But Mr. Rosenblatt said his clients would take payments on the judgment, if it were to be awarded.</p>
        <p>In Washington today, the United States Supreme Court rejected efforts by the cigarette makers to replace the presiding judge, Robert Kaye. Judge Kaye is a former smoker with a heart ailment.</p>
