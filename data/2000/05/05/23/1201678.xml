        <p>By fighting mock battles with its siblings a lion cub masters skills useful for bringing down zebras, and a child learns tactics helpful for survival in a competitive human society.</p>
        <p>Scientists, like cubs and children, also play, in more sophisticated ways.</p>
        <p>Einstein's ''thought experiments,'' for example, were a form of intellectual play that helped him understand the implications of relativity.</p>
        <p>When the celebrated popularizer of science Carl Sagan wrote his novel ''Contact'' (in the movie adaptation of which Jodie Foster travels almost instantly to a distant star system), Dr. Sagan needed to consult his friend Kip Thorne for technical help.</p>
        <p>Dr. Thorne, a relativity expert at the California Institute of Technology, undertook the playful task of analyzing Dr. Sagan's fictional scheme for traveling through black holes and discovered a fundamental error. Dr. Thorne went on to devise a remotely plausible alternative travel plan exploiting ''worm holes'' instead of black holes to communicate with distant parts of a spatially folded universe.</p>
        <p>Dr. Thorne's idea not only lent credibility to Dr. Sagan's novel but gave rise to a half dozen serious scientific papers dealing with the possibility of time travel. It also played a major role in Dr. Thorne's best-selling book for science fans called ''Black Holes and Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous Legacy.''</p>
        <p>In similar spirit, an imaginative and irreverent English scientist who writes under the pen name Daedalus has been tweaking scientific orthodoxy in weekly columns for the last 36 years. Daedalus's true identity is Dr. David E. H. Jones, a physical chemist on the faculty of the University of Newcastle upon Tyne in England.</p>
        <p>To the delight of his fans -- scientists and scientifically literate readers -- 102 of Daedalus's columns have been anthologized by Oxford University Press as ''The Further Inventions of Daedalus.'' (The first compilation of his columns, ''The Inventions of Daedalus,'' was published by W. H. Freeman &amp; Company in 1982.)</p>
        <p>A self-described ''court jester in the Palace of Science,'' Dr. Jones is an expert in chemical spectroscopy and other sober subjects, and since 1988 his column has been published weekly by the impeccably serious scientific journal Nature. But his research projects have sometimes flown wildly off the track of mainstream science.</p>
        <p>One of his achievements was the construction of a fraudulent perpetual motion machine, for which he offered a small prize to anyone able to deduce what made it keep turning with no evident source of power.</p>
        <p>After some two decades the machine still operates, he said, ''and although one scientist came close to guessing its secret, no one has won the prize.'' Perpetual motion, of course, is prohibited by the second law of thermodynamics.</p>
        <p>Another of his projects led to the discovery of arsenic in a lock of Napoleon Bonaparte's hair and the consequent suspicion that the French emperor had been poisoned by his English captors on the island of St. Helena, where he spent his final days. It turned out, however, that the wallpaper in Napoleon's St. Helena bedroom was colored with an arsenic-based green dye, and poisonous arsenic fumes were inadvertently released from the paper by mold. If Napoleon died of poisoning, it was apparently accidental.</p>
        <p>One of Dr. Jones's engineering successes was the construction of a bicycle so unstable as to be unridable. Useless as a vehicle, the bicycle became the basis of an article by Dr. Jones in a publication of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology called Bicycle Science.</p>
        <p>''The bicycle itself is long gone,'' he said, ''but I am now celebrated as the founder of modern bicycle theory.''</p>
        <p>Many of Daedalus's ideas begin as jokes and end up as serious contributions to science; some 21 percent of his published ideas (which have appeared in New Scientist, The Guardian and Nature), he says, have turned out to have at least some basis in reality.</p>
        <p>Dr. Jones regards Daedalus's crowning achievement as the prediction of buckminsterfullerene -- a chemical family of hollow carbon molecules. In its issue of Nov. 3, 1966, the British magazine New Scientist published a column by Dr. Jones titled ''Hollow Molecules'' that said: Daedalus ''has conceived the hollow molecule.''</p>
        <p>''This,'' it continues, ''would be a closed spherical shell of a sheet polymer like graphite, whose basic molecule is a flat sheet of carbon atoms bonded hexagonally rather like chicken wire.''</p>
        <p>In 1985 two Americans and one Briton discovered just such a molecule, giving birth to an entirely new branch of organic chemistry. In 1996 the discoverers were awarded a Nobel Prize in Chemistry.</p>
        <p>''There are one or two columns in my new book likely to have equally illustrious futures,'' Dr. Jones said, ''but I'm not going to tell you which ones they are.''</p>
        <p>They are not likely to be the Daedalus nuclear pogo stick or the black hole garbage disposal machine or a scheme, based on recent findings in molecular biology, to hasten the sentences of prisoners by aging them artificially.</p>
        <p>The Daedalus genius probably will not be implemented in building a machine that replaces the water in corpses with silica to turn them into stone replicas suitable as funerary statues. Nor is it likely that anyone will undertake a Daedalus-inspired investigation as to whether an alcoholic suffering from delirium tremens could draw from racial memory to visualize snakes and bats, even without ever having seen such creatures in reality.</p>
        <p>A more practical idea might turn out to be a Daedalus proposal to use the ''junk DNA'' incorporated in the genomes of all living creatures, including microbes, as a vehicle for storing vast quantities of information.</p>
        <p>Although Dr. Jones denies the existence of any philosophic agenda in his columns, Daedalus sometimes applies mischievous pseudo-scientific analysis to explanations of supernatural phenomena, including religion. Typical of the genre was a column published on Nov. 17, 1994, in the journal Nature (and included in the new book), examining ghosts and poltergeists, which ''pose a severe challenge to science.''</p>
        <p>He suggests that there are two worlds, one material and one spiritual, and that a poltergeist ''is a local leakage or coupling between these two worlds.'' The chill experienced by people while being haunted, Daedalus surmises, could be explained by assuming that the spirit world is cold -- perhaps 3 degrees Kelvin, the value of the cosmic microwave background left over from the Big Bang. In Daedalus's thermodynamic analysis that follows, he concludes that a poltergeist could be efficiently exorcized using an ordinary microwave oven rigged to operate with its door open.</p>
        <p>Dr. Jones acknowledged in an interview that some of his zany ideas had outraged readers. In a column in 1993, Daedalus outlined a scheme for measuring the velocity, direction and quantum-mechanical spin of a soul as it leaves a body at the instant of death.</p>
        <p>''The main gainer will be theology,'' he wrote. ''Traditional theology, perhaps, predicts that the soul of a sinner would depart downward, and would weigh less than that of a righteous believer.''</p>
        <p>The Daedalus soul meter could shed light on a host of matters, including the precise moment when a soul enters a fetus.</p>
        <p>''If the soul turns out to enter the fetus quite late in pregnancy,'' he wrote, ''the religious arguments against contraception and early abortion will be neatly disproved.''</p>
        <p>Dr. Jones admits that the latest book of Daedalus columns is not for everyone, even though the science in them is written to be accessible to nonscientists.</p>
        <p>''I can't imagine that anyone who is strongly against evolution, or who believes that intelligence is not inherited, or whatever, would ever read the book,'' he said.</p>
        <p>But even people with no understanding of science may enjoy it, he believes.</p>
        <p>Playing on a quotation from Thomas Beecham, the eminent British conductor, Daedalus said of the English, ''They don't understand music, but they like the noise it makes.''</p>
        <p>''A lot of people don't understand science,'' he added, ''but they like the noise it makes, so to speak. I try to address them as well.''</p>
